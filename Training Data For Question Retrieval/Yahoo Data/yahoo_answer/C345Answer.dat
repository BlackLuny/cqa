XHRquczeaa	Yes they are good, even though everyone hates them because they got a lot of publicity.    I like  Breaking Dawn the best, for reasons I can't say.    I hope you enjoy the books! =]    EDIT: Yeah, he's pretty cute. =]|`|twZI4VkHaa	They are the best.  It's like a love story with a twist and you can't get enough of it!  Once you start reading it you can't put it down.  I'm already reading the books over again for the 3rd time!  I can't get enough of them.  Gosh, I sound like a dork! lol    My favorite one out of the 4 is Twilight just because you get to meet the characters and you actually feel the love between Bella and Edward. It's amazing.|`|ReGhCqgVaa	Yes they are very good.  Please don't become one of those retards obsessed with Robert P. or Taylor L. though. They get quite annoying.  My favorites were Twilight, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn. The first half of New Moon took me a while to get through..the ending was very good though.|`|OilQvoLZaa	They made me want to gouge out my eyes with my finger nails, so I couldn't keep reading.

mvgfatSNaa	When I was 9, my brother told me he could break a brick in two with his head. So I held the brick for him, he took three deep breaths, and down came his head, THUD! Afterward, while he was unconscious, the UNBROKEN brick accelerated towards my toes breaking four and almost severing my pinky toe.  My toes did break the brick and all I can say is that I experienced MY pain.  Anyhow, 30 years later, numbnuts and I are going fishing next week.  Please keep us in your prayers.  Thank you.|`|7bfeb01febfb4a15cf89709e49e3db8baa	I'm hidden in the scream  When the virgin dies  I'm the ache in the belly  When your baby cries  And I'm the burnin' sensation  When the convict fries    I'm pain  I'm your pain  Unspeakable pain  I'm your private pain    And I'm the compound fracture  In the twisted car  And I'm the lines on the face  Of the tramp at the bar  And I'm the reds by the bed  Of the suicide star    You know me- I'm pain  I'm your pain  Your own private pain  Unfathomable pain    And it's a compliment to me  To hear you screamin' through the night  All night  Tonight    I'm the holes in your arm  When you're feeling the shakes  I'm the lump on your head  When you step on the rake    And I'm the loudest one laughing  At the saddest wake    Yes I'm pain  I'm just pain  Dear old pain  You need your pain    And I'm the loudest one laughing  At the saddest wake    I'm the salt in the sweat  On the cuts of the slaves  I was the wound in the side  While Jesus prayed  I was the filthiest word  At the vandalized grave    Yes, pain  Do you love me pain  I love my pain  I'm your pain    It's a compliment to me  To hear you screamin' through the night  All night  Tonight

She has to have SOME info on her old man.|`|29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	Penny was more likeable when she was searching for Desmond and they were separated. Now, she is kind of annoying. I find it funny that they named the baby Charlie. Of course it was after Charlie from the island, but Charles Whidmore will think it is named after him. I doubt they will kill off Penny because the writers seem to love the whole Penny/Desmond thing. I'm still angry that Walt is made an orphan and NO ONE seems to care about him. Walt is stuck living with grandma and NO ONE even checks up on him. Sad. Sad.
wHP3NPPHaa	First of all, look at the size of her heels! She's already probably around an inch taller than him and she's wearing like 4 inch heels!

The husband took a stone and just threw it for fun.  He was horrified to see it sail over a near by wall to an old house.  The stone broke a window and went inside.  The couple decided to go inside and apologize for that.  They went inside and found the door open.  Inside was an old man sitting on a chair with a broken bottle on the floor.  The couple said they were sorry for the broken window glass.  The old man said,it was OK.  Really he was a Genie.  He was shut up inside the bottle for a thousand years.  The stone came in and broke the bottle and now he is free.  They can just ask anything they want and it will be given to them.  The couple were very happy and started thinking how much money to ask for.  The Genie said," Can I ask you a small favor.  I was bottled for a thousand years.  I am so starved of sex.  If you don't mind can I have some time with this lovely lady."  The couple discussed it and decided what the heck.  They are going to get the fortune of their life.  They agreed and the old man took the lady inside.  After the sex was over and they were lying naked on the bed the old man turned and asked the lady," How old is your husband."  She said," 32.  why?"  Old man'" 32, and he still believes in Genie!".

Mizlm9ndaa	I think there are a lot of different reasons.  Often, people sing along with the radio and their voices get blended with the professionals and it makes them think that they sound better than they actually do.  Or they may not have a good ear for pitch, feel, etc..  The ego can do funny things to perception.  Look at anorexics.|`|LIyqb5Rwaa	1) Its hard to tell how you really sound until you hear your voice recorded and played back.  Few people ever really try to record vocals with a condenser mic and a digital recorder and get a true idea of what their voice sounds like.    2)  Most people sing along with recordings, and THINK they sound good because they're harmonizing with a real singer.  When your out there on your own with a dry vocal, it's a different story.    3)  I think a lot of people are very nervous when they try out for AI, and choke, both literally and figuratively.|`|eblcLGubaa	1. They have never actually listened to their voice recorded.  2. Their friends/family have told them they are good not to hurt their feelings.  3. Someone told them to go on American Idol as a joke that they took seriously.  4. They know they suck but they want to 'persue their dreams'.    Any one of these reasons, or more. I honestly think most people that go on that show are pretty dumb to do so, even if they do have talent.|`|zu6LcRYZaa	People don't realize that is because just because they suck, they know they love to sing.  For example, I suck at drawing, yet I do so anyway.  It is something for entertaining themselves and doing what they love to do.  I mean a lot of people is like that.  Just because they suck, also, does not mean they cannot sing and there is not a rule or law, saying they cannot.      But I think Singing ROCKZ~! Lol~! |`|VEHzqU8Jaa	i know i suck but i dont care  i just like to do it for fun|`|6UeDWQ45aa	Some people are tone deaf and can't tell their singing is bad.  Also, when you talk or sing, your vocal chords vibrate your head and consequently the eardrums.  Many people just need to record themselves to hear how they really sound and how out of pitch they are.  I work in a recording studio and have had some people think they can sing and they think they are great, but they really aren't.  Sometimes it's family members that encourage the behavior because they are also tone dear.    If people would just record themselves they would hear their true voice.  Here's a video about recording yourself using audacity and your home computer.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiH7j9VXm...|`|xfaS9uS0aa	A lot of parents/friends/whatever just tell the people they sing well because they feel bad or don't want to hurt their feelings, or think they should like 'pursue their dreams, no matter what', or something like that.  So the people think they're actually good.  But they're not..

There was a point where the show was  actually going to go to David Letterman but NBC chose Leno instead.  I guess NBC wants "The Tonight Show" to become a Legend with its  longest running late night show in history with different host.  SO now Conan is taking over. I love Conan and I think he should  stick to his own show.    What will happen to the Max Wineberg 7?  Will Leno's band stay and take over???    I don't think it'll be the same.|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Yeah, but Jay is gonna be on during 10 now and Conan will be on at 11|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	Yes & yes!

AA11176387	I don't care for her or the fact they acted a 4th judge which throws things off..now thy have to vote 3-1 or all 4 or if it is 2 and 2, Simon's vote carries more wait.      This will shorten their already limited time to comment about performances once they get the top 12    She resembles Paula too much and I feel they are trying to get rid of Paula down the road which is a mistake..she is needed there and also Kara is not interesting..Paula seems like she is barely commenting now.    I just don't like her at all..bad vibes or something...I feel they should not have added her..even Paula I read feels she might get cut and Kara is a poor replacement.    She seems harsher than Paula and the contestants need at least one person saying something good I feel..she also gives reasons for why she liked or did not like someone or how to improve unlike Simon who give little feedback and just says a catch phrase like horrendous..too karaoke or something.|`|kqc6Y4zSaa	Yeah she's pretty cocky and conceited about how she looks and her accomplishments...and whats with Paula this season? She is still her aggreeable self if they say Ye' she says Ye, if they say No she says no...its irritating she needs to have her own opinion...but I think its interesting that they both tend to get over talked by randy and simon like they aren't allowed an opinion...|`|8ada4f62b68d5b19c59d4fc405f8fab5aa	I personally think she was a great addition. She knows her stuff obviously and there needed to be another woman to even things out thankyou very much|`|9e2edc13bc584b5dbeead19cad26ffb1aa	I like her a lot more than I thought I would, in fact I wish she would replace Paula.|`|BHqDOTqkaa	I thought she was ok at first, but as it goes on, I'm not liking her.|`|AA11577613	They've been needing another judge, I think Cara's cool, she's also experienced with music and I've always found Paula annoying she always says yes because she feels bad or to be "nice". I don't think Cara is conceited she is pretty and she can sing so why can't she show that off....|`|AA12073868	Since I find the show to be les than entertaining and the concept of it wrong, I don't watch it. I have no opinion of the new person.|`|dfhSzLLEaa	I like her. She can sing so well and she's really pretty. Maybe she's a bit conceited but that's about it.

EuwjIJ3Zaa	Lala, although interpreting it very negatively, is kind of correct.    I have Venus in Aquarius being squared by Pluto in Scorpio, and the first guy I loved (Taurus) died in a car accident when I was 18.   We were together 3 years, and he was my best friend.    The second guy I was with (Scorpio) was a long distance relationship. He cheated, got the girl pregnant, got skin cancer, flipped out during a Pluto Opposition Saturn, Neptune Square Sun, and Saturn square Saturn transits (all at the same time) and left me, without a word, although I was supposed to be OK with knowing he really loved me?...    Sigh...So, yeah.  Death plays a role in this influence, atleast in MY experience.  But, death comes in many different forms.    Basically, Pluto's nature is to dig, and anytime that it squares any planet, it's going to squeeze stuff out, like a sponge.  The key to working with this aspect, is to remain honest and keep a clear mind.    After two ridiculously difficult blows to my heart, I'm finally learning how important it is to just...let things happen as they will.  Control has always been an issue, and it does add a manipulative flair to whatever your Venus placement is.  Even mine in Aquarius, in close relationships, I'm pretty hot under the collar, because I want things to go MY way.      Pluto ofcourse, doesn't care what I want.  It's nearly impossible to resist it's effects, and I end up fighting a losing battle, if I chose to fight at all...|`|VzJcl7WAaa	no idea what that is but sounds interesting.|`|TDVGgRAWaa	Square is not a good aspect. Mars and Venus are counted the most!|`|uxwSd0KLaa	With this aspect I am afraid you will loose lots of love ones in your life and I mean by death ; its quite a hard aspect

hk4v0G6faa	Content with Jessica, everything changed one morning when Jessica kicked him out after a passionate night of lovemaking. Confused by Jessica's distance, he was shocked when she claimed that he forced himself on her the night before. Though he tried to explain to Jess that his seduction was consensual, a regretful Jessica disagreed and she filed charges against him. Although an unrepentant Marshall pleaded with her to drop the case and threatened to use an old videotape of them making love to embarrass her, Jess refused to back down and went on with the charges. Realizing that Marshall truly did not see what he'd done to her, Jess cornered him in court and forced him to finally see that he had indeed raped her. Marshall's acknowledgment of guilt was enough to vindicate Jess, and knowing that he did not intentionally mean to do it, she dropped the charges. Later that summer, after feeling as if he were being stalked and harassed by Bonnie and her young charge, orphan Sarah Smith, Marshall discovered a startling fact--Sarah was his daughter, Zara! Shocked, Marshall decided to let the girl into his life and warned Bonnie to stay away or he'd tell the police about the shooting. Unfortunately, Sarah herself sought out Bonnie about her troubles adjusting to her new life. Knowing that Sarah was on the verge of discovering what Marshall did to Jessica, Bonnie convinced him to tell Sarah about the rape. Unfortunately for Bonnie, instead of Sarah lashing out at Marshall, she lashed out at Bonnie for keeping the truth from her! Marshall's undoing came when he finally realized that Sarah needed Bonnie and he asked Bonnie for help. Concerned about Bonnie's obsession with Sarah and afraid of her getting close to Marshall, Jessica threatened to reopen the rape case against Marshall if he didn't take Sarah and leave town for good. Unfortunately, Bonnie learned what Jessica had done and raced to Marshall's to stop him from taking Sarah away. Knowing that Jessica would make good on her threat, Marshall argued with Bonnie and told her he was leaving with Sarah. Unfortunately, Bonnie struggled with Marshall and in the melee he was pushed out the window and fell to his death.    Too bad too- I LOVED Marshall Travers- he was one of my favorite characters too!|`|yNfZO1I8aa	Bonnie accidentally pushed him out of a window. They were arguing over Sarah staying-Jessica wanted Sarah and T. Marshall to get out of Oakdale.     I don't remember this storyline very much, although I can recall some bits of it.    Well, she did plead guilty to manslaughter AND there could have been a bargain. 6 months, ehh-it's a soooooooap :)|`|LO3BMobRaa	I feel you on that, because I loved Lamman Rucker (Thurgood Marshall Travers) as well, he was so handsome and even had that little bad boy streak in him too. Bonnie got out of jail on good behavior, she caught the judge on a good day so he went leinient on her. I always felt a little empty watching the show without him for sometime because I had become espoused to him. I also miss Sarah and the original Bonnie, along with Ben (another looker), Isaac, and Jessica. I thought about Marshall everytine I saw Cecelia Ortega (Casey's old girlfriend), Sofie Duran (Gwen's brother's girlfrind), Both the original and second original Jade Taylor because all of them reminded me of Sarah Travers (Marshall's daughter). I wish Marshall was still with the cast, but I do have his last few months recorded on VHS, he's even more handsome looking back several years earlier.

ETFaQiTzaa	Tragically underrated with fantastic performances by both Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman.  What really -made- the movie, though, is its cinematography.  It's probably the most aesthetically pleasing movie I've ever seen.  Darren Aronofsky did a great job directing, and one of the best decisions made concerning the movie was to hire Clint Mansell to make the soundtrack.  "Death Is the Road to Awe" is one of my favorite orchestrated pieces.    And the ending is open to interpretation.  Some people think that he's writing the end of the story, and that that's what we're seeing when he's in the bubble--HIS story, just as the Spanish Inquisition was Izzy's story.    Others (including me) think of is as a present reality, and that throughout the movie he's explaining how he got to where he is by showing us the past, and the even farther past.  He's found some way to stall death until he can destroy it.  But all of this work was really in vain, except for the fact that he realized he -wanted- to die, rather than destroy Shebalba.  That everyone has to die and there's no point in fighting it.  Once he realized this, he was the happiest he'd been since before Izzy died in his past.|`|0l1hvLf9aa	under-rated? Can't be.|`|AA10768321	They never really say if the him in the bubble was really him or not. I personally think that the "Buddha him" was a look into his sub-conscious as he figured things out in the real world. But it very well could have been a future him, after he figured out a way to cheat death. I think that a lot of that movie was done to promote deeper thinking, and that it was ambiguous on purpose.    And in answer to the first question, yes, it was under-rated.|`|oOSNI3wbaa	i actually thought that movie was really boring. it was beautifully done, but boring. a lot like WHAT DREAMS MAY COME.|`|AA12185092	Not so much under-rated as a minority taste. Those expecting an action-adventure movie or a sci-fi epic were certainly disappointed. I was surprised and delighted  by its depth and beauty.    I saw the astronaut scenes as purely symbolic - the transcendent level of the story that played out as physical adventure in the past and emotional discovery in the present. Others have seen it as a parallel, far-future plot, but it seemed to me to be so loosely connected to reality as to be fantasy. I was re-reading "The Hero With a Thousand Faces" when I saw it though, and so was very tuned in to the symbolic aspects.

He escapes and grows up wild in the city's slums. Years later, he emerges to help the residents of the area who are being terrorized by street gangs and drug dealers.  NOTE: He's really more of a Tarzen of the urban jungle. I can't recall if he wears a cape, so I might be offbase on this.    I'll look around for a closer match.

Just ask my poor mother. She was married to one for almost 40 years.|`|A4T3GXnjaa	Gemini (May 22 to June 22) is a double sign and a certain duality is apparent in the pure Geminean. There is an ambivalence, a shifting outlook, which makes Gemineans delightful in their unexpectedness, but irritating in their inconsistency. Gemineans are often exasperating - but they can be relied upon not to be boring. A pure Geminean is a person with whom it is almost impossible to argue for any length of time. His/her mind is so subtle, moving ahead like quicksilver, that one can never be quite sure what one is arguing about. Gemineans have golden tongues as well as quicksilver minds; like the monkeys of Chinese Astrology, they can charm the birds off the trees, induce others to follow courses of action which they don't really think advisable, and fascinate almost anyone they wish.|`|cXRRP6ttaa	definitely double personality.  they can be sociable, intelligent, witty, socially adroit and very agile and flexible.  but also can be cunning and don't like to be wrong.|`|nstyHYliaa	The Gemini is a complex being that exists between the dimensions of positive and negative. This person is a herald of both of these energies, borrowing lessons from each and pairing them off with their opposite. This is representative of the Gemini duality. The Gemini is insightful, intellectual, analytical, and practical. They are ruled by Mercury, and earth element planet that governs the mind, the communication, and the logic. The Gemini takes logic and spins it cleverly, by pairing it with nonsense. It is in this way of uniting differences into one beautiful concept that makes the Gemini appear magical in nature. Paradoxically, there is no magic to the Gemini whatsoever. They are purely logical folk with an abundance of intellect, and take the most fundamental concepts and turn them inside out. It is through their workings with the fundamental that make them, in fact, so fundamental.

hmsCFQocaa	Everybody is shooting down "We Can't Dance". That's a shame. Just because it had a couple puky love songs on it doesn't label it a loser! And the Invisible Touch/We Can't Dance sound was so good they were making beer commercials off it for ten years.     Just because the common middle school student could suddenly understand most of the lyrics doesn't mean the trio's crafstmanship went south. They deliberately went more commercial to sell here and get a bigger concert draw. And if Invisible Touch sucked so bad, why did Disturbed take a cover off of it?    From We Can't Dance I favor No Son Of Mine (I'm adopted), Jesus He Knows Me, and the best song on there is Dreaming While You Sleep.    I got hooked by Duke, so the older albums had less impact.    Order:    Genesis  Duke  Abacab  We Can't Dance  Invisible Touch  A Trick Of The Tail  Three Sides Live  Wind And Wuthering  And Then There Were Three|`|gDxMoBl9aa	In this order    Abacab  Genesis  A Trick Of The Tail  Wind And Wuthering  Duke  And Then There Were Three    Ya'll are missing it, Collins Era Genesis is fantastic up through "Genesis"|`|a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	For Phil Collins era Genesis, I prefer the album "Duke (1980)," over the album "A Trick of the Tail (1976)."   Duke is definitely one of my favorite albums and 'Missunderstanding' is one of my favorite songs.  Phil Collins becomes his own man on Duke, and the album works best with his vocals.      "Duke (1980)" is more upbeat than the earlier, more instrospective Genesis albums, and it forecasts the musical direction Phil Collins would take on his later solo albums.  However, Duke is still Progressive Rock - and it straddles that line well.  Duke is where Phil Collins truly comes into his own as a singer, and where he shows us the confidence that he has reached that point.      Phil Collin's voice lacks the grittyness that Peter Gabriel's voice has, and ideally you want a combination of a gritty voice and a tender voice: think Linkin Park, Lennon & McCartney, etc.  Early Genesis used that formula between Gabriel and Collins, and that is one reason they were such an amazing band.  But, when you make heavier music to need a vocalist like Peter Gabriel out front to pull those songs off.    "A Trick of the Tail (1973)" is amazing, but Phil Collin's voice is too soft and velvety to work on the heavier songs.  Had the album been sung by the Phil Collins/Peter Gabriel team, then it would probably be up there with the best Genesis albums ever made - because the songs on Trick are brilliant!   The song 'Carpet Crawlers' showcases Phil's amazing softer, more tender singing - a direction he explores later in his solo career.    http://www.amazon.com/GENESIS-DUKE-RMST/...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_(album...|`|78d567ba4ef552df04b4e4bac0f97f4daa	Abacab|`|nYqtw9DWaa	Invisible Touch.

These two movies are a MUST SEE for any true soccer fan.  They show that know matter what happens in their life, as long as you are strong enough to perservere and go for your dream, you can achieve the improbable.        BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM  GOAL  Goal 2  She's the man  Gracie  The Big Green  Ladybugs|`|8yE2sYGeaa	Bend it like beckham?

"Somebody photographed him and Sage together and it started this massive rumor that he's dating some supermodel named Annelyse, who's not even her. Us Weekly even printed it. My friend Sage is getting such a kick out of it, you have no idea."     This is where the rumor started that he was datng Annelyse, it was actually one of Nikki Reed's friends.    As for Kristen Stewart, I totally disagree.  Kristen also has a long time boyfriend.  As for Camilla Belle they have been friends forever, sicne she dated one of his friends.  Robert is still saying he is currently single.|`|pVdV4gwgaa	He is ugly. Anyone of those would be too good for him~!|`|iz8hh0vNaa	It doesn't matter if he is or isn't.  It's his choice who he dates.  If he likes/loves her, then good for her.    And obviously being a fan of Robert, I'm pretty sure he wouldn't appreciate you saying stuff like that about his girlfriend, it's just rude an inconsiderate of you.|`|XR0VnlXjaa	I think Robert is dating various girls...Famous or not...It's his choice..but to answer your questions...He could still be dating her.|`|ec4yhkhuaa	I heard hes dateing Camilla Belle.

AFbjjLocaa	Um... some ideas    - Kikyo dies, killed by Inuyasha because she tried to kill Kagome. :)) a bit unbelievable.  - Kagome is kidnapped by Naraku, and inuyasha saves her in the end and Naraku dies.  - After Naraku dies, they get the whole Shikon and Inuyasha becomes a full demon. (when i say he becomes a full demon i think he will stay the same but will be more stronger)  - A legendary demon is awaken by Kikyo's spirit to get revenge on Inuyasha.  - Kagome is killed by that demon and Inyasha kills the demon  - Inuyasha gives up of being a full demon and he resurrects Kagome with the power of the Shikon no Tama  - Inyasha becomes a half demon again and he marries Kagome.  END   hope u liked my story :))|`|3zGoVqGFaa	Everyone in Inuyasha gets laid and Naraku finally dies|`|yQ0DukuBaa	if i would have the chance!    I will make them more lovable    more love scene and more rivals!    of course! I will make them some like love quarrel then other man enters the life of kagome then kikiyo will become alive!    then inuyasha will look for kagome!    after the forgiving episode the man will kiddnap kagome and inuyasha will fight and win and they live happily ever after
gJhwH335aa	Light took advantage of the rule that 'those who gave up ownership of the Death Note will lose all memory related to it'.     Thus he has no fear of saying incriminating, and if the confinement L put him into last long enough, the others will think the fake-13 Day Rule will come into effect.    The flashback is when the shuffling of the notebooks takes place, so the Death Note that Rem takes off with is Light's original one. The reason why Ryuk and Rem swap notebook is because it was necessary to make Ryuk the Shinigami possessing Misa. If it stayed Rem,she most likely wouldn't let Misa trade for the Shinigami Eyes again.    In order to switch Shinigami, the notebooks is shuffled around. The aim is to have Misa's memory relating to Ryuzaki (L) return so she can kill him.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Light was making sure if his memories would be lost by passing the notebook around, but he found out it didn't. He needed to do something by testing it. By passing the notebook around, the owner of the notebook shifts. If Light says that he's giving the notebook to another, the owner is switched to the other person that Light gave it to, but his memories are in tact.    The rule in the Death Note: if the user is willing to give up the notebook, s/he shall lose their memories along with it.     This rule means that the person has to give up the whole Death Note (memories and ownership)    Light didn't really give up the notebook. He just passed it on.    When Light lost his memories, he gave a hint to Ryuk about it, and Ryuk left to do his duty.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	Light gave Misa's death note back to Rem (as he is the owner).  Light surrendered his to protect himself if things went wrong|`|sZ0lv9jyaa	light wanted to know if he still had memories of death note if he passes it on. it was just an experiment...

v1hCymAEaa	The manga was first published in Japanese  and then became an anime in Japan as well in 1998. The manga was dubbed by Tokyopop and then it then the anime was dubbed by Nelvana. The clow cards however do have english names, Im not entirely sure why but Im pretty sure there is no way to say the names other than in english or it may sound a bit weird. The anime has also been in the languages of French,Korean,Spanish, Italian,Dutch, Tagalog,Chinese,and Swedish. The english dub however also changed a few peoples names in the anime like Sakura Kinomoto is Sakura Avalon.     This website has the dvd of 1-80  if your interested:  http://www.toysnjoys.com/cardcaptor_dvds...      Hope this helps!    :-P|`|dFk5bRlCaa	i think it is originally from a japanese comic book called a manga. they just use the english terms for some.    you can try online stores, lots of them available. or ebay if you want it cheaper.|`|XNIkS3KNaa	The original is Japanese.      It's very hard to find the dvds for Cardcaptor Sakura since it's an older anime and it's been discontinued.  If you ever come across the 2 box set for a good price (anything under or around $200) if you can got it!!  Chances are you see it again.  It's my favorite anime, I payed about $220 for my 2 box set.  Good luck!! :)    Also just a little tip so you don't get ripped off when trying to fine it to buy.  There's 18 dvds total, split in 2 box sets, 70 episodes and there are also 2 separate movies, the second movie ends the series.    Others sites to watch online:  http://www.veoh.com  http://www.animekiosk.com    Hope I helped some. :)|`|3N2ElzcQaa	The anime was originated in Japanese. The cards with the English titles were like that since the anime was in Japanese. Besides, Clamp put the idea that these cards were made with British magicians, so the cards would be put with English names.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	I have seen a lot of the animes do "corrected" artwork to reflect the english part of things|`|3XMOrE4Haa	I believe it was originally Japanese. =]|`|dfBYe4Vyaa	the manga was originally in japanese     it was dubbed into English so we can understand what they are saying obviously and they may have changed the lettering too.    or since it was adapted from the manga it may have been made for a foreign audiance in the first place     im sure if you google for the dvds amazon or some other company has them available.

4Gd5eAtpaa	Earlier that morning the farmers daughter had inadvertently left the gate to the yard open as she was preoccupied by her worry over a maths test set for that day. She hadn't studied for the test as she was still deeply distressed over her fathers recent heart attack. This, coupled with the added burden of household chores now delegated to her because her mother was out trying to get the west field prepared for sowing, had made her quite forgetful and distracted of late.  Whilst several chickens escaped, only one strayed so far that it actually encountered the road facing the farm. After crossing the road and gorging itself in a soybean crop, the chicken was struck by a furniture removers van as it attempted to make its way home.   Several hours later the dead chicken was spotted by a Community Mental Health Worker who was doing his bi-weekly rural clinic run. The chicken, being a bantam caught the eye of the Mental Health worker, who was a keen trout fisherman.   "Cool" thought the mental health worker- "those feathers will make for excellent trout flies". He stopped and plucked a handful of the most iridescent blue, green and orange feathers and placed them in an envelope. He rolled himself a cigarette, sat on the trunk of his car and admired the clouds. "God, I love this job", he muttered to no one in particular.|`|N24wkFROaa	it didnt. it got killed and eaten up the next day in KFC.|`|r7bmz65eaa	because it saw pierre bouvier from simple plan and wanted and autograph!|`|a8a441aa6973c0e73348e618806e0c1faa	lol|`|jto3YOQJaa	because that's what roads are for :]|`|AA12127696	i dont really know....i cant read a chicken's mind|`|Esl2Ogi7aa	because he felt like it! why do we question chickens motives? lol|`|znXF1Ujraa	to go on the other side|`|QRNmJTF0aa	To kill miley cyrus|`|642f36b07715245515ee502250477dcaaa	Running from a crazy butcher XD|`|zRyGcN6yaa	Because the stupid chicken didn't want to stay on the side of the street with Kentucky Fried Chicken selling their Chicken special with 5 free drumsticks.|`|O23x96t5aa	The chicken was blonde.

geq6iU0Oaa	Lead Belly (he was adamant about the spelling-two separate words) was certainly a powerful and compelling artist. Not many could have sung their way out of prison once, let alone twice. Many don't classify him as blues due to two basic facts. The first is a widespread misunderstanding that arose out of early blues research, namely that people like Son House, Robert Johnson, Charlie Patton, etc. had repertoires that consisted solely of blues. Subsequent research demonstrated that virtually all early bluesmen played everything from pop to country in order to please their audiences and garner tips/gigs. The second is that since Lead Belly's recordings did incorporate a wide variety of music, he was somehow outside the blues tradition. However, that variety is due to the fact that Lead Belly was "discovered" by a folklorist rather than a record label scout.    As tremendous as Lead Belly was, however, he was not really an inspiration for Rock & Roll (nor was Robert Johnson for that matter). He was a tremendous influence on Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Odetta, Bob Dylan, and the entire folk revival.|`|444cc0a50021891de69824c19550f54daa	he was a very big influence on modern music but there were of course other artists who left their marks in those days.  he's not always seen as a blues artis since his music is not always strictly blues.  Many of the songs he played are more folk orientated.  he did some great stuff and definitely helped shape blues and rock music later on but he was not the only one...|`|GvmVDJ7Eaa	no|`|2vzj65Kfaa	ANd because of this, he gave a piece of his humanity to share with the world.    Not everyone gets to do this, but some of his songs will touch people for generations to come; even when they don't know who wrote it, or who the man was ... they will know his humanity from the words and music he left us.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	one of the greats for sure, 120 years old today had he lived that long. RIP. folk- blues- one of the fathers of rock... it doesn't matter, that's all just marketing, what matters is some of the greatest recordings in music history, and some of the greatest songs penned in history.    out of curiosity, did you know it was his birthday when you asked?|`|ecL0ZbfCaa	Leadbelly is incredible, I think his music stands apart from a lot of his peers because it is so melodic and he covers all genres.  He's very similar to Dylan in that his songs are so open to reinterpetation, often the cover versions are better than the originals. eg 'Nirvnana', 'CCR'.|`|AA10883519	Dude, it's such a subjective matter that 25 people could give you 25 different answers. There's no doubt Leadbelly was a huge inspiration to others, but it's hard to unequivocly say he was the sole inspiration for rock & roll. I think it's enough that he was a peripheral influence on Son House, and an even more direct influence on Big Bill Broonzy, Muddy Waters, and Bo Diddley.  Diddley and Muddy could've really been the main sources for blues crossing over to rock & roll. The Bo Diddley beat's still heard in contemporary songs to this day. Muddy's potency is another contemporary part of the place blues inhabits in rock.   It's enough to say that without Huddie's music, rock & roll might not sound the way it did. That's a good enough legacy for most musicians and listeners.

Y8TS6Do0aa	NON - Cleanliness and Order     Bondage Fruit - Octopus-command    Both of these might be kind of hard to find, but they both make me feel really groovy. NON is industrial noise, but that song is wonderfully satirical with the way it uses prerecorded voice, and Bondage Fruit uses an extremely complex structure and variety of instruments to create a sound that's unlike anything I've heard before.|`|zZ8kMeImaa	Into Dust - Mazzy Star|`|2bVxBCgzaa	Get yourself "Exodus" by Bob Marley.

People here are Rude, Accusatory, and if you make a mistake on a music question or misspell something -- They pick you apart, like Wolves.    This place is for People to Feel More Superior than others.    BQ --    1. --    We sat by ourselves, still looking for company;  there could have been peace, but that eluded me -  all I could think of was what was on my mind.  You tried to be kind,  but I blocked your feelings;  now, senses still reeling, you sit in your quiet room and cry.  You tried to make me one,  but I always hide when there's a glimpse of sun.             Running along in sunlight meadows,  your eyes were never more than half-closed:  through fluttering lashes, you watched me watching you.  I tried to be true  to the way that you thought I ought to be  but in spite of all my efforts I failed.  I tried to make you see  but your eyes are blind to all but the bad in me.             What do you think I mean  when I say that I need you?  How am I supposed to seem  when we hit another problem  and the answers are all torn from my book?             Our lives are on paths we just can't control;  we can grow closer as we get old.  Can you imagine us as we adjust?  Can you imagine us  getting near eighty,  we live more sedately, still hoping the dreams will come true?             We'll try to be secure.  But I'm of uncertain mind  and how can I be sure?  How can I be sure?    2. --    I promise you, I won't leave a clue:  no tell-tale remark, no print from my shoe.  Still, a steady trail to the water's edge...  I will keep my pledge to the end:  I intend to go free.             No more rushing around, no more travelling chess;  I guess I'd better sit down, you know I do need the rest....  Yes, it's time to resign with equanimity and placidity  from the game.  I can't explain;  I can't relate....  Have I done it all too late?             Now is the time for the commission to report;  till lately, I thought I'd been planted.  Trying hard to make it all come real,  permission to feel is ungranted.  But now it's happening I'd like to keep it private if I can;  last words, last looks, make a final stand.  Now my number's come up on the Pools,  I guess I'll board the Titanic for a cruise....             Now is the time to make my status clear,  too late, I fear, and lonely,  as friends and enemies traverse the stage;  all in a rage disown me.  And all the pit-props shatter into dust about my ears:  memory and conscience, hope and fear.  As I crawl out further on the limb  something tells me I am crawling   in to unknown prophecies and lives  the rainbow's end is hemmed around with knives....             As I stand on the boards and the stage lights grow dim,  shall I go out of doors, or shall I maybe go in?  Have I reached the point when I should take my cue  and follow you and your signs?  I can't remember my lines  as the prompter cat-calls  and the cards all fall  in the strike.             All the pages are thin, all the corners are curled.  Does the starshine fall in through my window on the world?  Or am I living out (the seeds of doubt) a chronicle of revenge?  The willow bends  as do my hands;  do you understand?  And will you still be my friend in the end?             When my mouth falls slack  and I can't summon up another tune,  shall I then look back and say  I did it all  too soon?  .|`|bxfInqBPaa	Rogues by Incubus    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWbjk3y4d...|`|Z1FYjWmJaa	Imagine - John Lennon  Running from the Rain - Thursday|`|S4QBvAaGaa	Anywho, I'm not sure what cheers you up but I get a kick out of these two, sad or not:  "Pushing The Sky" - Yoko Kanno (Not-so-heavily accented Japanese guy singing about ...

8yE2sYGeaa	Honor and he wanted to show him how real men died|`|SKFIjyoVaa	it still wouldn't have saved him, also they both agreed to meet peacefully, and leonidas would  never have lived once he tried to kill xerxes. besides that, i do believe that he had snipers trained to him, so he wouldn't have even had the chance.    as far as the spear thing at the end goes:    Xerxes claimed to be a god and that he was above all men (as claimed by himself and his loyal soldiers/slaves) it proved that xerxes was no god. if he scarred xerxes, he would have left the mortal mark on his face for all of his army to behold, making them question their leader and loyalty, making them lose their certainty of victory. after all, victory tells us that the second spartan army was successful in defeating the remnants of xerxes' army    hope this helped    -aaron|`|Bve1SCP1aa	It wasn't in the script...  :)

voxHyrYSaa	The truth about Scientology was not widely known until fairly recently.  Scientology is all about money, power, and influence and celebrities are likely unaware of much of the abuses.  Lots of dark and dirty secrets.    The rich and famous have been specifically targeted by scientology for obvious reasons, and there is a definate "caste system" within, with benefits for the powerful.    Recruitment of new members, including celebrities is way down, and many abuses are coming to light via lawsuits.  Hopefully they will lose their tax exempt religious status soon, as that would hurt what they value most: $$$$$.|`|WyxxDgSeaa	Publicly, I doubt it's any help at all. Most actors who are Scientologists don't mention it or at least don't make a spectacle of themselves the way Cruise has. Privately, who knows what it may give them.|`|fLmlpGu7aa	I agree - Tom's career is in a nose dive thanks to his Scientology insanity, although I might see a Travolta movie unless he starts pushing Scientology any harder    Edit: I disagree with Kfidz. In fact I bet admitting that you are Scientologist could be a liability ( I have a hunch Kfidz probably is one)|`|fqfgdtdKaa	Many people that have some pull in Hollywood are into Scientology.  You get in with the right crowd and you could be getting roles that were never available to you before.|`|I89QzChuaa	The Celebrities do not see the horrific side of scientology and the "low-level members" who are victimized cannot talk about it and I suspect that most (I say MOST, because I have a feeling Tom Cruise IS aware of it), don't know the extent to what goes on deep inside their cult.  That's why there's the beautiful Celebrity Center in California. That's where they go when they do their course work.  Unlike the members of the sea org who are sleeping 10 people in one hotel room in the Fort Harrison Hotel in Clear Water, Florida.  I doubt Cruise or Travolta would be doing anything like that.    And I think they believe scientology helps their careers because they are  being put through the same mind control techniques as all the others are. They go through the same courses, such as the TR courses where you sit face to face with someone and you have to keep your eyes open for 2 hours at a time without blinking.  That is one crazy a$$ mind control technique. And it's done very slowly so you don't know its happening to you.    The kicker is they didn't become famous because they're scientologists.  They were already famous BEFORE they became scientologists. They come to believe that they couldn't have gotten as far as they have without scientology but the fact is they were already on their way.

DUg1IkTIaa	The "monster" is a shape-shifter. It gets ideas from people's memory and then becomes them.  It was last seen as John's father, in the holding cell.     The "monster" was one of the original occupants of the UFO.  The UFO is now disguised to appear as an island.  And, yes, it can travel through time and space.|`|GLnVPp2Caa	I thought it was interesting that John Locke had drawn a picture of it when he was a child (as seen in Season 4 when Richard Alpert visited him at his foster home.)|`|PAzDgYOXaa	its the Spirit of the island|`|33b94b9ca6424b402cc93e362666a6caaa	I dont think Black smoke is some kinda monster, Obviously the script of Lost wasn't prepared when they decided to air it, and they kept bringin confusions n mysteries to solve, mysterious islands with some powers, numbers, dharma, time machine, and then Ben knowing everythin about every other person. truely Im totally lost in Lost.    they keep bringing more mysterious before solving prior ones, the idea was powerful bu not for 5 seasons. look at prison break they are ending it cus they know if they will bring up more stuff they will lose viewers. look at the season wise viewers of Lost and they are going down and down.    I think writers should find some answers we have been lookin for before we totally lose our interest Lost.
05mK1t7Raa	My Common Enemy  Season 4 Episode 7
nstyHYliaa	Sun in Virgo: Your general personality is that of a Virgo: Intellectual, analytical, charming, insightful, inquisitive, curious, clever, conscientious, diligent, fickle, witty.    Ascendant in Scorpio: Your outward personality matches more with that of a Scorpio. Others either love you from the start, or hate you from the start. You may make secret enemies. You make enemies due to coming off as too intense or intimidating. Meshed with your Virgo sun, this may be more quieted, and instead you might radiate a silent magnetism that draws in a variety of different people who yearn to get to know you. Although, 99% of them will never truly get to know you, as you are highly private and a master of deception, and keep your true feelings hidden away within yourself.    Moon in Scorpio: Paired with your Sun and Ascendant, you are a highly insightful and piercingly analytical person. Your vision goes straight beyond that of outward appearances and obvious fact to the workings behind those facts, and you may even have suspicions towards the intentions of others. Typically, you are an internally sensitive and intense person, with balanced emotions. You may keep this sensitive side from others, preferring to exude a more stable and self-possessed demeanor to the outside world. Those who get to know the true you are in for quite a treat.    Venus in Virgo: If you are a man, you are attracted to innocent, feminine women, with a certain air of submissive naivety to them. You like others who are clean and meticulous, with particular attention to the details in life. You appreciate others who take the same subtle pride in their snappy appearance as you do in yours. The unfortunate side to this placing is you may never find love, due to too many personal inhibitions when it comes to expressing your feelings, and consequently, others may never get to see the true, romantic, magical you that you know exists underneath that calm and cool face you put on.    Mars in Leo: If you are female, you are attracted to men who are proud, loud, and flashy. You get a certain security out of being with a guy who will take the spotlight off you, but with this, you get to be the secret behind-the-scenes worker who is keeping his show as spectacular throughout the years. You yourself may have a particularly even temper most of the time, however, you hold extremely high expectations to yourself and others, and at the slightest hint that those expectations may not be met, you can snap and blind others with your subtle and sharp temper. You have a highly critical tongue in your state of anger, and may lose all sense of remorse. As a result, most people whom are unlucky enough to fall victim to your ugly side may never speak to you again, either out of personal hurt or fear.
y3hRdUI3aa	Kind of personal choice.<br>  <br>  4 strings(thick) vs 6strings (typically)<br>  <br>  You like rhythms? leads? <br>  being the front man with the high energy, maybe guitar.<br>  <br>  Sitting back, keeping a good bass line going, <br>  jumping up front every once in a while...Bass.<br>  <br>  Whatever you like.<br>  <br>  bass players are rarer to come across these days anyway, so I'm sure it would be much easier to get into a band as a bass player unless your a pretty awesome guitar player. You can get rolling on bass a little sooner than guitar too.|`|IdUENGLxaa	anyone is good,<br>  but maybe u should start in bass cause everyones playing guitar these days, lol<br>  maybe even a ukelele|`|pAg6yHmPaa	Get a Bass!!!! too many bloody guitarists out there|`|bZud91iuaa	If I had to do it all over again I would play the bass.  Good bass players are hard to find and are in demand more than guitars.  A solid bass line is really what makes a song and fills it out.  Just imagine a song without a  bass.  I can't.  As you learn bass you can pick up on guitar, a lot of musicians do.<br>  <br>  Just my personal opinion|`|5TLNvw9Daa	well..<br>  i started with guitar...<br>  then I got a bass a couple years after.....<br>  <br>  <br>  bass was easier for me.. but somehow I like the guitar better...<br>  <br>  so yeah..<br>  really its your choice..

YupMCYHlaa	Yes, it was Gene Kelly, with Jerry the mouse (of Tom and Jerry fame) in Anchors Aweigh, 1945.  Great film.  The scene with Gene and Jerry is iconic in movie history.  Other films had mixed animation with live action, Disney did it several times and it was even done in silent films (done best by the Fleischer Brothers who did Betty Boop, Koko the Clown, and Popeye).  But this was the best example so far, with the characters dancing together, holding hands, Jerry sitting on Gene's shoulder, etc.    Family Guy did a 'hack' of this film to show baby Stewie dancing Jerry's part.  I thought it was brilliant!  But it's much easier to do today with computer animation.  It occurred to me, as I watched it, that there was a whole generation of people who had never seen the original and wouldn't recognize it.  Which is sad, but that's how things go.  Family Guy has a lot of 'inside jokes' that not everyone gets.|`|sfnRrAAmaa	Stewie from Family Guy dances with some guy once, i think its in an old movie like Annie or something..|`|1gbR22CRaa	Paula Abdul and I think it was a cat|`|8yE2sYGeaa	"Anchors Aweigh" as Gene Kelly dances with Jerry the Mouse|`|szJSaZspaa	stewie and some guy from some old movie|`|O2hmjOPyaa	The cartoon you're thinking of is likely Family Guy.

UIbv2aXlaa	The pig lady is a Maenad which is some kind of mythological creature.  In the books she stops Sookie on the road and hurts her really bad and poisons her but eric, bill, and pam heal her.  Anyway the maenad and sam have sex and hunt together in the woods at night according to the books.  She is very evil and in the books can practically kill people just by touching them but she leaves and sam says maenads don't stay in the same place long out of fear of being recognized because there kind is supposed to be extinct.   So since she wasn't in the books for long im thinking she might not be on the show that long either but im not sure which direction Alan Ball will take her character.
nOLVHNaBaa	Can't wait, but Naruto's underestimating Pein way too far if he was really using a clone lol (unless I'm misunderstanding something?)|`|juyXgHfkaa	I read the same thing and I believe it is a truth that Naruto that is fighting with Pain is a clone and the original one is somewhere gathering the fight experience.    the new Naruto is awesome|`|ckiqO9V0aa	Hmmm never though about that, although i do agree the sage Naruto KICKS ***!|`|zL6DGRmnaa	i think its the other way around he is using a clone to gathere the natural energy while he fights paine theres no way he would have a clone fight while hehas to stand around and do nothing but gater energy

WLYuDrlMaa	no. you are probly holding your abs in, instead of lifting with the diaphragm. basically take a deep breath, and not lifting your chest, you are using your diaphragm then. good luck! :)
Gdcc62cZaa	It was never clear on who the person was on either the photo or the girl in the bed. What we do know (or led to believe) is that the girl in the bed was actively participating in one of Faraday's experiments (possibly with time travel).|`|57f6ab92048e820f90e75894de592233aa	From the picture Des found probably his girlfriend at the time but she was one of his experiments that went wrong. Widmore was funding her care. She did look like Charlotte but it's not her. Faraday probably felt guilty and that's why he went to the island.|`|ibiO4VEQaa	Might have been one of Charlotte's sisters.|`|DUg1IkTIaa	I thought it was Daniel and his Mom (Mrs. Hawking).     My guess is that the woman in the bed was one of Mrs. Hawking's sister.  My bet is that she was part of Mrs. Hawking's time travel experiments.     Desmond is heading to L.A. to find Mrs. Hawking, as far as I could figure out.

6W4ZWOetaa	Hey there,  I have a bachelor's degree in vocal performance...     I think you have a very nice voice.  I think the only problem that you have *is* your confidence.      I know from personal experience that when I'm not feeling confident I sound worse... I can't hit the notes that I want in the way I want to.      And that's what it sounds like to me is that you're a little unsure of your voice and so you sing way up high in your throat when really you should be pushing from your diaphragm with confidence... even if you think it's going to sound bad.    Honestly, most of the time it won't sound bad... It's a matter of the muscles beeing relaxed enough.    Unfortunately, as you probably already know since you seem like a smart gal, the answer to gaining more confidence isn't easy.      I say go for your tryouts!!  When I was auditioning for some major roles during college sometimes the biggest confidence builder for me was trying out and getting rejected (I know that sounds weird), because it didn't turn out as awful as I thought it would...    Also remember that singers like Beyonce get their voices put through a TON of equipment while they are being recorded so they sound *better* than perfect...  so if you feel bad because you don't sound like Beyonce, don't!  Even Beyonce probably doesn't sound like Beyonce without all her equipment to help her out, even when she's singing live.    My advice is practice practice practice; join your school choir, try out for your school American Idol.  Even if you practice in the shower where no one can hear you, it's still practice (bathrooms have great acoustics by the way).    Good luck!!|`|IpPpfREeaa	download bollywood songs|`|UN3NSaqSaa	yeah|`|y4Uliyq3aa	You have a very nice voice. My advice to you would be to keep practising. That will build up your confidence alot!|`|RnFpjFODaa	yeah you can sing a lot better than some of the girls in my choir  audition, you'll do great
qhczVrhQaa	Oh my gosh i know, majorly confusing!  What you have to do it keep selecting around.   If you stay on the screen and just wait, something will move. If you select this part then something new will come up. It happens on the title screen even. There are so many hidden things.  On the one with Howard & the baloons, click up so there are loads of green arrors around his eyes. Thats one right there.  With the parka people do the same for another feature.  On the nannagedon scene (first bit i think) there are 3 screens. You just have to wait and it will automatically move on. Once the moon has gone past you can select the little window in the flat.  There are just loads. Dont select anythng and just watch the screen for movement, This will usually allow another feature. You just have to click around a bit.   If you still have trouble then most of the features are on Youtube by a user called BooshBonuses. x|`|Mz1I71gVaa	You don't know where anything is, thats the point. It's so fun!

hs9Mibf5aa	They haven't officially told us yet, but judging by the way Daniel kept staring at her, and the storyline.. and the timeline,    I believe it's his mom as a young girl/woman.|`|ibiO4VEQaa	His mom I think too.    You can give birth on the island like Claire did as long as the baby wasn't conceived on the island like Sun and Jin's but Sun left the island before her time was up. So Charlotte could have been born on the island.|`|YIcBd569aa	charlotte mentioned something to the effect of being born on the island, she didn't want to leave the island when  daniel was getting into the raft ,she said because she is looking for the place where she was born. miles asked her is it because there is something here you have to find he knows she was born on the island.o. go to www.tv-video.net to rewatch that episode season 4 when they were leaveing for the freighter. or go to wikkipedia lost. the problem wasn't that babies werent born on the island but that the mothers would usually die before giving birth that is why they were so afraid of claire and jin dying.  but i think it was the woman who were concieved on the island that were affected or vise versa. its a little skectchy for me.|`|PAzDgYOXaa	his mom i do belive its the fiftys  also i think richard is his dad|`|JCdBSULraa	I thought it was the bedridden woman, or the mother of the bedridden woman.  Although it could be Charlotte's mom.    Charlotte has said a couple times that she's on the island because she is "searching for the place where she was born".  The fact that children could not be born appears to have been a recent incident after the introduction of the Dharma initiative, as Richard has more  young people with him in the 50s.|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	I think she's Daniel's mom in the past.|`|aLNolhhVaa	I agree with the post above. His mother. Or possibly Charlottes mother, as Charlotte was born on the island. But more likely Ms. Hawking. He gets her into physics, she gets him into physics.    Edit. His time travelling mouse was named Eloise...Elly, for short. So it's his mom.

5iQ4FE1Uaa	It hasn't been revealed yet, but my money is on Jenny. She accused the producer of stealing it, but when Tina confronted him in the restaurant, he acted like he didn't understand what she was talking about. Jenny is getting crazy again.

2vzj65Kfaa	Have a perusal of the new book "1000 recordings to hear before you die" - it should be good food for thought.    And, just to toss in my own suggestion - as much as I like "Drifting" ... I think the song 1945 - "It's Been a Long, Long Time encapsulates the feeling of the boys returning home from WWII better than anything.    Also, not sure if it was 1929 or not, but I am a fan of the tune "Brother Can you Spare a Dime" as a statement on the times.    Additionally, if this is a 'century' project, why keep going past 2008? and if not, then why not reach back into the 1800's as well.

It is not what you do and don't do, it's what He did for you. Free gift so you better take it and live in God's kingdom when you  die. Thanks.|`|AA11287246	Nothing is wrong with good intentions, but you must use common sense.    Some of the worst things can be committed with good intentions. Hitler was doing what he thought was right.    The point of this saying is that you cannot self-justify your actions by simply telling yourself "I mean't well."    By having a neutral intention, but still doing what is good and right, you maintain an objective view which allows you to see the big picture. You treat each and every situation as life and death, and you will never make the wrong choice.     A man with good intentions may approach a vagrant on the street, seeing him in desrepair and wishing to improve his life by cleaning him up and giving him a proper meal. Instead of commiting a good deed, the man is struck on the head and left for dead, wallet missing.    This is why you must have neutral intentions, but always with morales, ettiquitte, and civility.     Shades of grey my friend, remember the creed of a true Christian;    Love  Hope  Faith  Charity  Sacrifice    As long as your priorities are well organized, and you live by such morales, your intentions will never lead you astray because (despite having neutral intentions) your actions will lead you toward God.|`|QhwrNuaHaa	Yes. If you ever have good intentions, stop yourself immediately and have some bad intentions. The best way to ensure your road into heaven is bad intentions. It's only logical. I recommend burning down an orphanage. Or cut to the chase and burn down an orphan!|`|IlUUP0CXaa	Well this is what Madonna says so it must be true lol    "The road to hell is paved with good intentions"|`|G2ex4HYuaa	not only do they Pave the way,but they also hang sheetrock and lay tile in purgatory.|`|yhGJ2Shjaa	Well, Jesus already died, right?

15b20bc2f63d778baab60d206ce6c1a4aa	You basically asked three questions so here ya go:     A1: Its been explained, in an interview I believe, that souls (they dont have to be Shinigami) with high spiritual pressure/reiatsu can become pregnant/have children in the way humans in the real world do. These souls are new to the cycle of life and death while the other souls, like Rukia, are recycled.     A2: Most families are makeshift as families from the real world hardly ever get together again. A boy in Rukongai (in chapter 76 Boarrider Comin)  explains that unless you committed collective suicide and received a numbered ticket together then you wouldnt know what district your relatives were sent to. So most family groups in the Rukongai are not really related. From my understanding noble families come from a long line of Soul Society born souls- souls which are new to the cycle of life and death- which is why they dont want them mixing their pureblood (perhaps they are descendents of the King) with those souls of the Rukongai. My guess is that the lesser nobles, like Izuru Kira, are from a shorter line of S.S. born souls.     A3: Well Kubo has done a poor job explaining anything about aging in soul society. I think this may be because he hadnt planned certain things out yet when he started the story. We can assume that a person maintains their human appearance based on the fact that Yuichi (the kid in the parakeet) looked as he did in Karakura town when Chad saw him again in soul society, and because apparently Rukia was an infant and her sister was older just as they had been in the real world after going to Rukongai. What happens to a person who dies of old age is unknown but Id guess that they would remain old looking.|`|LcSwDbr4aa	Hitsugaya is the reincarnation of his zanpacto's spirit, thus he is the naturally born genius talent that comes around once every 1000 years.    Families in the soul society are probably maintained after the souls that arrive there are finally reconnected with their loved ones that had died in the generations before them.  When Ichigo and his friends first travel to the Soul Society and Chad meets up with the spirit of the boy that was linked to the bird, he was still looking for his actual mother, but living with a 'makeshift' family since the Soul Society is apparently a huge place.  As far as nobility goes, I know there are 4 great Noble households (the Kuchiki family being one of them), several minor noble families (Izuru Kira and Nanao Ise's captain both belong in this group).      I assume once you enter the soul society you are the age you appear when you die.  However, once you start getting used to your ectoplastic environment and able to control your spiritual pressure (and/or feel physical hunger) you will be able to better mold your image, and/or grow older (in the case of Yachiro).      These are only my educated guesses on the matter, so right or wrong, feel free to agree, disagree, or change your own opinions based on them.|`|r7BR7sWmaa	Hmmm, thats a really hard question... have you tried checking wiki or anything like that?    I myself am a Bleacher, but not to this extent.    But remember.. shinigamis are very old people, Ukitake for instance is over 400 years old, as well as Kyoraku.    hope this sorta helps XD|`|aIVCuT64aa	i dunno... somehow i thought he screwed up abit on all that. the whole soul society thing is real complicated. we can give assumptions, but i think the best is to ask Tite Kubo himself.    i think maybe in soul society you can still have babies so hitsugaya was maybe a pure dead thing? it doesnt make sense i know.    and maybe the people who died of old age just dont appear in the whole story.    kisuke and rukia and all that actually age, so im guessing that a long long long time later they'll become old.    ahh well.

1a7a0cf046a8cc88c96c77bdb1c8559daa	The Sun entered the sign of Pisces at exactly 11.47pm GMT (London) on 19th February 1982.<br>  <br>  The Sun enters each sign at different times each year. What is stated in the popular horoscopes are only estimations, they're rounded off. You can't blame them - it's impossible to also print the Sun sign changes for every sign in every year, together with the horoscopes.<br>  <br>  It's up to each of us to cast our own natal chart for our precise Date Of Birth, Time Of Birth and Place Of Birth, and then to see where our planets are. Only then can you have an accurate reading and interpretation. Otherwise, you're just groping in the dark and wasting your time - like asking this question, sorry about saying this.<br>  <br>  You're very probably an Aquarius. But, like I said, if we don't have your birth data, then nobody will know for sure.<br>  <br>  What you can do is, use the time given above to do a calculation. The time given is 11.47 GMT, that is at 0 degrees Longitude, which is the same as London's. Find out the time difference between London and your birth place.<br>  <br>  Next, if your birth place was East of London, ADD the difference to the time above. If it was West of London, SUBTRACT the difference. The result will be the Sun sign change at your birth place. So if you know your birth time, then see if it's before or after this time. Before = Aquarius, after = Pisces.<br>  <br>  Since your birth date is the 18th, and the Sun changed signs at almost the 20th of February in 1982, then I think it's very likely you're an Aquarius Sun.<br>  <br>  But we are all not just about our Sun signs. There are all the other planets expressing themselves in you too. E.g., regardless of TOB, you have Mercury in Aquarius; Venus in Capricorn; Mars, Saturn and Pluto in Libra; Jupiter in Scorpio; Uranus and Neptune in Sagittarius. The Moon changes signs every 2 1/2 days, so yours could be in either Sagittarius or Capricorn.<br>  <br>  If you can accurately cast your natal chart, you'd be able to also see which houses or areas of life all the planets fall in. This tells you about how the planets actually work in your life.<br>  <br>  There are free Astrology lessons in this site: <a href="http://www.bobmarksastrologer.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bobmarksastrologer.com</a><br>  <br>  In Numerology, your birth date makes you a Number 9 (1+8=9). Nines are ruled by Mars - they're courageous, impulsive, quick-tempered. These are supposed to be lucky for you: the colour Red, day of the week Tuesday, the gemstone Red Coral or Bloodstone.<br>  .|`|297722c0ef6ce9124786f723a0860348aa	Yes, do not worry,|`|70860a41a58f8d75a2a493037473b6fdaa	Go Aqua!!|`|ad88770e8daaa8fb3189264e894a776eaa	lol im like the same way im a gemini/cancer cause im right on the boarder line i just consider myself as a gemcer lol because i have some traits of a gemini and some of a cancer. i dont think that helps u but.. o well|`|d26978075320f7d5cc8e57ef4384e618aa	yep!|`|e1d833e24bb73b5d98cd7dd5fb2455b1aa	what the hell kind of quesiton is that? if Feruary 18 falls in Aquarius then yes....you may be on the cusp if its at the outer end of the next sign.

mP6naFLDaa	One of my favriots is a movie called "Untraceable", its about an enternet cerial killer who host a website that triggers different things and tortures his victim and I love the reality of this movie because it is possible and it makes you count your blessings.Another good move is "The Invisable"which is about a kid who is stuck between dead and alive o he has to have someone find his body but he cant comunicate.My all time favriot is "Fight Club" this movie has extreme intelect thrown in with Fighting, and Sex bvut the thing that makes this movie arouse me is that it really makes you think and it could be possible.I would suggest you watch all three movies if you get the chance|`|w2Dui70Faa	Pulp Fiction.

Not the old one, the newer one with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. That movie is absolutely completely insanely beautifully amazing. :]  The suspense, action, romance and drama of that movie, are incredible. Not to mention the special effects...   Plus Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are like THE actors of this generation. In any movie, they're wonderful. Especially in movies when they're together, like Titanic [duh] and Revolutionary Road, which just came out.    It's not really a mystery, because you know what's going to happen eventually, but you also don't. Actually you probably could classify it as a mystery, because it keeps you guessing the entire time, and you don't know who lives or who dies...     But seriously, I love that movie so much. :)  I'm listening to the song "My heart will go on" Right now, hehe my iTunes are on shuffle... ironic I know.

d3422f90292b41c6fdbdf6ff86da20adaa	Well, advances in the field of electronics, signal transmission and reception allowed for the development of tv's as we know them. Of course there had to be a market for them, and there was and is because it allows for easy communication, entertainment, and distractions that most people desire.

I think the Juno character Ellen Page portrayed just attracted audiences b/c that's worth calling someone a beautiful person, an innocent teen. not the fact that a teenager got pregnant. so cliche.

You can tell that you've got the basis for a voice, but you sounds pitchy at times and fall off tune. There are points where it seems as if you're singing through your nose rather than using your diaphragm. <br>  <br>  To improve, getting vocal lessons is the easiest way. They help you learn to use your voice correctly and will expand your range tremendously. Join a couple choirs at school or at church if you attend. At home, on piano, guitar or any instrument, try playing a note then attempting to hit it vocally. <br>  <br>  Another thing you might want to work on would be matching the vocals to the song. Perhaps it's because your vocals aren't too great at the moment, but it seems as if the lyrics and music didn't really fit together all that well.

AA11277210	Hmm, interesting.  Devestator was never much more tham brute force, I believe.  He never really used energy weapons all that much.    Voltron had a wide range of weapons, plust the blazing sword, which could slice any robeast in half.  As slow as Devestator wasw, I'd say Voltron could filet him in nothing flat.  Propose switching the Decepticon force to Predeking, the Predecons ultimate form.  THAT'S a fight worth seing.  The Predecons individually would overwhelm the lions in speed and ferocity, and Prediking has better speed and power than Devestator.  Again, I'd think the lack of a long range game plan may hurt them, but it would be a hell of a brawl.|`|6680eeacb48df8dec592a176037fd9c9aa	i think devastator could take voltron out, but omega supreme would take them both out at once|`|7e1baf1389ee729d645d9fe9842c6839aa	Voltron was the bomb...

nstyHYliaa	What a complex personality. There is likely an abundance of charm and charisma. You are the initiative type, always attracting the attention of others and willingly leading them into your personal life. You may flit from person to person quite often, and you may lose touch with some people you meet. It's just that you meet so many that it's hard to become as close as you'd like to be to everyone. You get along with many different personalities. You are eager to lend a helping hand, but you may get easily bored shortly after volunteering your abilities if the activity isn't something you're particularly interested in. You are there for your close friends when they come to you with problems, and offer great advice which usually does them a world of good. Your presence is known when you enter a room. You may use charm, persuasion, or emotional appeal in order to sway others, but you usually only do it when you are trying to avoid something.    I need more time to analyze this personality to go any further.|`|VsP8t5rbaa	I think you mean psychic...so in my professional psychic opinion....stay in school

She wasn't named "Bay Bay Bay" because she was singing the song Ay Bay Bay, that came after he named her when she started dancing to it. However, she was twirling slowly when he came up with the name, so it was probably half random half her moves.    You can watch the episode online here;  http://www.megavideo.com/?v=XBUMZ8CY|`|AfndK9LKaa	they called her that because when they brought the girls in to give them their nicknames she started dancing and singing the song "bay bay bay".    shes also from Oakland.

You can just type in political cartoons or weekly political cartoons on your web search and a slew of sites will come on.<br>  <br>  Also, Time.com , Time magazine has the weekly run of political cartoons that can be viewed and all can be emailed.   Some are so hysterical, I email some to my epals.    Good luck<br>  <br>  Edit:  If you want vintage ones, again just type the name of the area you want, say A.

1NVMh8wSaa	me and 2 friends were at a Rush concert in Boston around 1996. We had the first 3 seats in the row way in the back balcony and this guy who was completely wasted sits on the step at the end of the aisle next to my friend and starts tapping him on the leg asking him if he liked Rush. Over and over he keeps asking. After a minute or 2 security makes him move out of the aisle so he leaves and then comes back to the same spot at the end of the aisle asking if we liked Rush! Security comes and makes him move again. A few minutes go by and the guy came back AGAIN for the 3rd time! Still wanting to know if we liked Rush. Fortunately the 4th time the Police came and took him.<br>  <br>  At my first club show I saw Death at a place in Salisbury MA and there was this huge guy wearing a black T-shirt with white letters that said " I F**k on the first date" and he was just wrecking everybody in the pit. It was really funny. At the same show I let a friend borrow money for a shirt and someone told the cop at the door they thought I was selling drugs so I was taken outside and was searched and questioned by about 3 cops and sniffed by a K9. They looked a little dissapointed to come away with nothing though|`|ME4XWNmRaa	I ended up getting into a fight and meeting Brad Whitford and Joey Kramer in the medical area of the arena.

HDyqzvUkaa	Don't jump the gun, it's a long journey.  Master your craft first.    Learn how to use software like Protools and just start putting your ideas together.    Edit:  I don't know how good you are but if you're asking for help on how to start a music career, you're nowhere yet, so start with the basics.  You can't just walk into a place of music production and say "See, I'm Hot ****" and expect them to give you studio time.  They only produce what will be sold.  Also, even if they did "sign" you they would own you and your music.    ProTools is editing software.  You will need a good mic so it picks up correctly.   With these to simple tools you will be able to record and edit to perfection you vocals, and if you feel comfortable with the music, ProTools has tools to make beats and all kinds of sounds.    join the music community, get a band together to help you write, it'll be faster and funner.      EDIT Edit: there must be a way to communicate without editing my previous post...surely...    Anyways I better get Best Answer on this one!    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Tools  (This is the Internet, search for it)    The software is going to be overwhelming at first so you may want to take a class or find instructional videos online.    There is other software but this is the most widely used in the Music Industry right now.    Get ProTools and a GOOD Vocal mic.  Consider them your paintbrush and canvas.      Note on Miley Cyrus and the music industry:  Miley Cyrus is not an artist.  She is a fabrication of the Music Industry, a product marketed to youth. ( this is not to say her music is bad, that is opinion based) her music is created by someone else and is owned by someone else, she is meerly the face of the music.  If you are hoping to create something along this quality of music you need Marketing.  Thousands and thousands of dollars.  And Synergy connections.    Also you must be celestially beautiful.  A few quirky flaws are ok, and makeup can cover some acne, but you must have good facial symmetry.  If you don't and you really want to succeed i strongly suggest surgery.   Also, Go on a diet! i don't know what your frame is but you can always lose a few more pounds, right?     To be clear, some of that was sarcasm, but all of it is true.

AA10479574	thats dumb youre gonna believe that witch? you dont even know what really went on.    hes a human being. he makes mistakes. besides did you ever think he was doing what he thought was best? he was on tour and its not like he could go to her house breakup with her in person then drive right back. thats a waste of time and it would still make her upset. he also couldnt string her along and wait til he comes back. thats pointless too.    its not even your business to hate anyway. its called a PERSONAL life.     I see Taylor's side too so Im not really taking a side against her...I can understand she was hurt so if she has a problem with him thats fine but to go so public with it is not right. noone else can have a problem with him for that reason. its between him and Taylor only because if one wasnt there they wont understand.    plus did you ever think it was 27 seconds because she ended the call not liking what shes hearing.|`|0GxV0gnaaa	I wouldn't waste my time hating on someone as pathetic as Joe Jonas. lol.|`|MXpW48lFaa	No I don't hate him.   You shouldn't hate him from that phone call.  FYI; she hung up on him,   because she didn't like what she was hearing.  Also, he had to call her because he was out of the country.  Like the saying goes,  The Longer you wait, the more they're going to get hurt.  To be honest, I think he did the right thing.    Also Taylor Swift made a big deal out of it for a long time.  I get she was sad and angry, but she went a little too far.|`|Pa88n7ZAaa	no and i don't think u should hate him for that cause we have no idea what the full story is and we never will|`|7lQfCrbcaa	Hate is such a strong word!|`|pQBjqMkoaa	i hated how he was more girlie than her|`|rKt2UNI3aa	i used 2 like joe jonas, but after he dumped taylor swift over the phone, he just seems like a pussy.|`|XR0VnlXjaa	he seems to full of himself.|`|twZI4VkHaa	There's always two sides to a story. And according to him, she was the one to end the call. But I don't think you should hate someone just because of that. Heartbreaks always happen but for celebrities, their break-ups are in the public eye and it's almost a guarantee that there's going to be a "he said/she said" situation. And besides, how long was she expecting the "break-up phone call" to last? Celebrities are always busy and they can't just stay on the phone for hours on end, especially to break up.|`|tnw6XpVwaa	nah, i love him.. and besides, we shouldn't judge him just because of that phone call.. it was taylor who ended the phone call anyway..|`|ZaxDGSbyaa	I HATE JOE JONAS BECAUSE HE LIKE A GIGOLO|`|kqMuhsnJaa	NO!he's my superman!  anyway, why will you judge a person according to his personal llife? maybe there WAS a strong reason he did this. u never know...alll JB hater are lifeless!!! i dont care if i get a thumbsdown, it's my job to answer so i did!|`|3ok7pKMNaa	On the fence.

Of course I am not going to do it, but, when I ask them to do it, it is like no they have to have "something" in the deal.

AA11263877	Usually people start on clarinet and switch to sax so you might want to ask the teacher about it.<br>  <br>  I think you should start with a student model because if he doesn't like it you’re out a lot of money and a student model is easier to play. You wouldn't need to upgrade until he was in 8th or 9th grade anyway.<br>  <br>  The main difference between the two is that the pro models are a little bigger (the button are spaced out more for bigger fingers) and better quality.<br>  <br>  I would not rent a sax because it is about $30 a month, which is $270 for a 9 month school year! And if you buy one that costs $500 I think you could sell it for the $230 which would end up to be the same, that's if he uses it for only one year.<br>  <br>  And any new sax should get him through several years, if he takes care of it.|`|AA11103004	I believe Bundy is the standard student sax to buy - fairly inexpensive but a decent enough instrument. <br>  <br>  If he sticks with, you can always upgrade.|`|AA11112418	It is better to get the student model first. The professional models are MUCH more expensive ($2000 or more) and if his interest only is through high school, you are still paying a lot of money for it. The pro models are much more customized and set to do actions that professionals know but students don't and won't learn until college. For the time being, I'd recommend renting. This way if he decides the saxophone isn't as great as he thinks it is now, you can stop renting it and you don't have to worry about selling it. Rent, let him get used to it, and see that he really wants to continue. Then get him a good student saxophone. The reason for the student saxes is they are made to be played by anyone, and they are able to take the beating a student will put them through, and they will get beat up. Then once they hit high school or college and know how to take care of their instrument, you can upgrade them to a professional model that will take them to the next level.

vgBK9F0eaa	to enhance your performance you could use an 'overdrive' for drive a 'chorus' pedal to thicken the sound and a 'delay' to give it space...pay attention to your amplifier settings?...and adjust them to the acoustics of the venue?...tubular furniture,high ceilings and wooden floors are echoey and carpet and soft furnishings and curtains can be sound absorbing!...a clap of the hands on stage usually gives you a clue to the answer?...depending on your line up?...lead guitarists usually play their guitars set to full volume (for best tone) and use less attack with the pick whilst playing relevant fills/chords or sometimes a mixture of both until your solo... But!!!...make sure they fit the mood of the song...and remember!...sometimes its what you leave out that can be good (Eric Clapton plays less notes but with 100% feel!) and a good tip is to feed youre guitar lead thru the strap before plugging it into the guitar?...this prevents stepping on it and pulling it out of the jack socket!...which results in suffering an over dose of un-wanted silence!...av good un...|`|MVZ6Mpa1aa	Use a decent Amp with reverb and overdrive you should be fine - better start practicing young 'un.|`|95K3Xd6Raa	1)No, pedals are not necessary although many lead guitarists use them for effects purposes. Some amps have different channels for rhythm and lead guitars with the latter giving a boost in the signal.    2)You could but usually its not necessary as you are probably already playing a little bit louder.    3) This depends on the nature of the song. Some lead guitarist follow the rhythm and break off for solos. Some play different variations of the rhythm. Some play separate riffs and lead through the whole song so to speak.    4) Not really. Its hard to say not knowing what your set up is but pedals are a great way to achieve different sounds without switching amps or guitars. If you're just playing a show or two I wouldn't worry about it too much. I work at a recording studio and we will get classic rock, indie rock, and hardcore all out of the same amp but mind you we are working with great amps. It really depends on what you are playing out of.

538ceb4acaef4ac2ccf484f71831be0caa	I've been a fan from the very beginning, and when Kate was killed, I thought there was no way the show would ever be quite as good. But it was sheer genius in the casting and writing to pull in Ziva. She's completely different, definitely NOT meant as a "replacement" per se. And they allowed at least one entire show for saying "goodbye" to Kate.    I now watch the reruns on USA network as well as new episodes on CBS, and I have to admit that as much as I liked Kate, I look forward more to the Ziva episodes.|`|Pa88n7ZAaa	i really prefer ziva more i never like kate's character|`|A03NJA26aa	Ziva and Kate are different people but the both managed to get "close" to Tony. He pick on everyone, I know that, but he tends to lean more towards Ziva and kate when she was still alive. I started watching right before Kate was killed and then they introduced Ziva. She looks and sounds a lot like my friend who is Italian and has the same hair style and everything. I'd have to say that I like ziva better since I've seen more episode with her in it.|`|8ab3o89Taa	I personally think Ziva is better. She has more attitude and more knowledge of bad guys so to speak.  Don't get me wrong Kate was awesome but I thought after a little bit she got stale.  But all in all Abby is my fav.    Edit: No, I have watched it since it was introduced on JAG... but either way I love the show.|`|5T4r0Geiaa	i prefer ziva... she's way better|`|9Iy69I3Qaa	I liked ziva. all the way. kate was a good charactor and she did bring somethign to the show being that it was so opposite between her and tony and their constand bickering, but with ziva on the show, its better. she and tony have something going on between them which i really hope they go into more detail and expand on that thought. that show could use some kick-*** mossad trained assassin. =)       and to aswer your second question, been watching since the spin off from JAG.     ((NCIS obssessed))|`|AA11918551	I think it was way better with Kate in it. Ziva just gets on my nerves! I started watching it after Kate died.

(; )  If I knew the following: "Just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world, she took the midnight train goin' anywhere," I would Google the following:    Lyrics just a small town girl livin' in a lonely world she took the midnight train goin' anywhere    Works every time :)|`|Yue2YKTnaa	its by jay-z and DMX
dpYMlxA4aa	It's hard to say. The biggest thing going for it was the novelty factor.    I think the novelty factor has already worn off.   The Youtube Symphony is the same as any other festival orchestra with the one difference being that you audition through a youtube video instead of mailing in a CD or auditioning in person.
Qv1q6VP7aa	I am bisexual I've never acted on the same sex issue(still in the closet ) and what is to you if I display that or not .... and that suppose to make me creepy...what about their talents unfortunately for you gay stars are the best they have great voices .....they are gay so what are you going to do about it ? they would still be icons after 100 years.

I was coming home from a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert went to sleep at the wheel and rolled my car two and a half times landing on the roof. Since I ended up in the hospital, Allen noted on the air why I was missing from the air and said "I guess we're gonna have to start calling him Rollover MIkey." I was close enough to Billy at the concert I could have hit his piano with a piece of wadded up paper. He was my favorite piano player. Freebird will never sound the same.

Thank God the roads were clear. We had about 5" here in Wolcott, IN. There have been some slide offs this morning with the wind blowing the snow.    When I got home I decided to look at the answers. Glad I did. I forgot it was Happy Hump Day. I really got a kick out of the ones who provided the terriffic contributions to Happy Hump Day. They made me laugh (almost out loud).    Glad Lincoln is gaining fast. If he keeps going it won't be too long before he will be able to go home. Isn't the magic   5 lbs?    Crazy H how far is your husband willing to travel to do work. I'm not sure what state you are in. If it were a little far from home we would put him up here while he does some work. We have 2 extra bedrooms.    bucsandducks sorry to hear about your grandmother. Like the others have said it was good you were able to be by her side when she went. She felt comfortable with you near.     Prayers for all. Please all get better.    jcm (Janet)
UAunAKdtaa	well major labels would be able to get your promo through.  there are thousands of indie labels getting started daily, most of them fail to support their bands, end up in debts and dump bands left and right. major labels rack in shitloads of money, but they get stuff done. sometimes they are stiff with contracts they make with bands, but then you're free to walk away...idk, major is more secure i think, but beginner bands cant get to them unless theyre really good and are recommended by a few reliable sources.|`|sS7PpQEDaa	Mainly, the majors have millions to pump into promotion and strong distribution arms (distribution = getting CDs into all sorts of shops) and the indies don't.

Thus the opposite would mean either jeans and a collar shirt, or really informal meaning t-shirt and shorts or so... hope i helped homie|`|lLs8tcU4aa	Well for what I know of the definition of 'formal' and 'informal', formal meaning for example this sentence.    I didn't do nothin'. informal  I did not do anything. formal.    So a formal surprise party would be more like work or a business environment. Manners, polite, wearing suits, ext. And an 'informal' surprise party would be like a no uniform, very active, silly, get drunk, doesn't matter if everyone's insane, just as long as everyone's having fun sort of party.

OV66q85iaa	it really depends on the person looking at it.    This is what semiology is teaching, the humans before us branded names and which are favorable things, calling a pencil a pencil or a stone- a stone. Perhaps telling us that mestizas are prettier than a chinita or a morena... but what if a stone was called a pencil in the first place and vice versa - will it matter now? Of course not. Because they are just names. And humans were instilled what the men before us thinks is beautiful. So my answer is, all of them are pretty, it will really depend on who's looking at who.    In my case, I like morena more.|`|EeQ6qL52aa	chinita|`|DMjxbn3Jaa	Huh?|`|QSgJc7HPaa	morena, yum yum gimme sum morena

I think it is pretty sad that she got the s$$$ beat out of her and people start spreading rumors about her.  Even if she gave him herpes that does not give him the right to beat her down. Yeah that would suck but it is against the law to beat someone like that.<br>  Don't get me wrong.  I am not a fan of either one of them, but people need to know the details before they start making accusations.|`|j7wESGaDaa	NO. she didn't have herpes in the first place. It was just a cold sore.<br>  And he didn't even get it. In all the pictures of her w/ that cold sore, he doesn't have one at all. and in the pics taken of him after that, he still didn't have one. so no, she didn't give him herpes.<br>  <br>  and it wasn't just that txt that caused all that. from what their friends and family have said they're both very hot tempered people and it was all probably just pent up anger. after she threw the keys out the car and threatened to call the cops on him, he lost it (but it wasn't cuz of herpes). they both have anger problems and didn't get help for it, as sad as it is, it was bound to happen. and btw, she hit too (a lot of ppl don't know that).<br>  <br>  i hope one of them make a statement soon.<br>  <br>  and no one RLLY knows what happened 'cept for them and the police. i'm just writing from reports i've seen and heard.<br>  <br>  hope this answer helped =]|`|6KXv6qiDaa	ummm...well he did not BEAT THE CRAP out of her....her injuries would have been way worse if he beat the crap out of her soo......and the herpes rumor is FALSO.|`|QKW3aHGUaa	Lol.|`|JzTg0hg5aa	WHO CARES! <br>  <br>  lmfao the whole thing started over a text?

I live in the Port Angeles-Forks area and I can't even get into my favorite restaurant (Bella Italia) because of all the tourists who have come here to "be close to" FICTIONAL places in the book where Bella and Edward supposedly were! The wait is TWO HOURS to get into that restaurant because thousands of fans of the books want to have mushroom ravioli there, as Bella and Edward did. THAT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE BEST DISH THEY HAVE THERE---but what do I care? I'll probably never be able to eat there again--not if the series continues!<br>  <br>  EDIT to BellesCul: I'm not opposed to tourists--we've always had tons of them in this unusually nice part of the world and they have always been greeted with open arms. It's the REASON for their being here==a FICTIONAL account of something that NEVER REALLY HAPPENED HERE!!! If it REALLY happened, it would be understandable that Twilight fans would be descending upon us. But FICTION is keeping me from getting a table at a restaurant I've gone to for years???? It just doesn't make sense.|`|RSP5djNbaa	Twilight is finished. I heard that Midnight Sun wasn't going to be coming out because of the leaks, but I don't know.

AA10656900	Language:  HINDI  <br>  Director:  Rakesh Roshan  <br>  Producer:  Filmcraft  <br>  Cast:  Hrithik Roshan, Priyanka Chopra, Naseeruddin Shah, Rekha, Sharat Saxena, Hemant Pandey, Puneet Issar, Archana Puran Singh, Maaninee Mishra, Gin Xia  <br>  Music:  Rajesh Roshan, Sailm-Sulaiman (Background)  <br>  Lyrics:  Ibraheem Ashok, Nazir Faraaz, Vijay Akela  <br>  Cinematography:  Santhosh Thundiyil  <br>  Editing:  Amitabh Shukla  <br>  Screenplay:  Sanjay Masoom  <br>  Story/Writer:  Sachin Bhowmik, Honey Irani, Robin Bhatt, Akarsh Khurana, Rakesh Roshan  <br>  Art Direction:  Samir Chanda  <br>  Action:  Tony Ching Siu-Tung, Sham Kaushal <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Is it a bird, it is a plane' No it's Hrithik Roshan!!! <br>  <br>  It's not enough to say that Hrithik is one of the best actors of the country. Extraordinary is the word for the measured manner in which he glides through the air to the beat of Rajesh Roshan's rather-vapid songs... or cuts through the breeze to the stunning special effects created with a verve so-far unknown to Indian cinema.<br>  <br>  "Krrish" takes us into the world of masked fantasy where the stakes are incredibly high... as high as the computer-generated leaps that the super-hero takes as he tries to save the world from the clutches of a megalomaniacal villain with a glint in his eyes that can only belong to Naseeruddin Shah.<br>  <br>  Though there's a sense of slackening in the earlier portions of the lengthy narrative, the last lap of this luscious voyage into comic-book fantasy is undertaken in a spirit of complete conviction and credibility.<br>  <br>  You can't miss the sign posts. We've seen so many Bollywood heroes doing heart-in-the-mouth stunts. But never in an Indian film have we seen a hero look so elegant and relaxed as he glides over water and mountains to vanquish the power-crazy villain.<br>  <br>  Though the scripting in the first half reveals signs of formulistic fatigue (scenes where the village-bred Hrithik tries to spook the globe-trotting journalist Priyanka Chopra are straight out of a Joy Mukherjee-Asha Parekh musical from the 1960s), the second half revs up proceeds to an exceeding high, precipitating the kind of action and thrills that have so far been alien to Hindi cinema.<br>  <br>  The scripting in the second half, specially the portions that show Krrish's father (Hrithik doing a double role) and the villain reading the future to see their own impending deaths, are masterstrokes of plotting invention.<br>  <br>  Quaintly Rakesh Roshan mixes old formulistic conventions with sights and sounds never seen before. The synthesis is not just inviting but also enticing in ways that re-define the cult of kitsch and escapism in our cinema.<br>  <br>  It's not enough to get technicians from abroad to do the action. Other Hindi films have tried it before. But none with the élan of Hrithik Roshan as he glides across the frames in strides that replicate the measured might of a panther.<br>  <br>  Make no mistake, "Krrish" belongs to Hrithik Roshan. He again displays his skills at dancing, fighting, emoting and just being comfortable with the camera without once letting the sweat of the toil trickle into the frames. Here's an actor who stubbornly re-defines the concept of screen heroism with every performance. <br>  <br>  In "Krrish", Hrithik is required to make the transition from a simpleton in the village with superpowers to a masked crusader in Bangkok. He brings to the film's fantasy element a kind of innocence underlined by a subtle swagger that furnishes the duality of the masked character the musk of masculinity and vulnerability. His initial romantic sequences in a designer-dhoti with Priyanka Chopra are endearing. The two make a believable pair. However, Priyanka is unnaturally subdued, the fire doused by the overall dynamics of the goings-on.<br>  <br>  Hrithik's scenes with his screen-grandmom Rekha exude warmth, though it's hard to accept Rekha as a grand-mom.<br>  <br>  Naseeruddin Shah as Hrithik's opponent is so cool you wish there was more of him. Priyanka Chopra's character represents the reluctant forces of cut-throat ambition that threaten all the heroic innocence of the supernaturally blessed hero.<br>  <br>  We've seen it before in "Superman", "Batman" and "King Kong". But our "Krrish" has something extra-special those films didn't. Hrithik Roshan
AA10656900	Send up a silent prayer for rediscovering that old lost pleasure of a powerful plot that Fanaa retrieves so affectionately for us. Also send up a prayer for an actor like Kajol who fills up the screen with feelings and thoughts that go way beyond the tears, fears and jeers of a workaday movie.<br>  <br>  Shibani Bathija's powerful drama about the tumultuous romance and tragedy between a blind Kashmiri girl Zooni (Kajol) and her guide, mentor and tormentor Rehaan (Aamir Khan) is suffused in the silken sounds of a heart feeling the first stirrings of love and hurt.<br>  <br>  Kajol expresses the delicate fragrance of a blind girl's romantic and sexual awakening in the hustle bustle of Delhi with a sure-fire sensitivity that energises the plot and gives the narrative the edge of excitement that cinematic romance captures once in a while.<br>  <br>  Cinematographer Ravi Chandran shoots in places that the camera seldom visits. But Jatin-Lalit's songs, though well shot leave little lingering impact.<br>  <br>  The romantic interludes are beautifully written. The shayari between Zooni and Rehaan flows out of the script to create an insouciant intimacy between the couple.<br>  <br>  Just when the romance builds to a quiet crescendo, director Kunal Kohli brings in huge dollops of drama. In quick succession, Zooni regains her eyesight (a medical miracle straight out of the cinema of the 1970s), loses love, returns to be with her parents in the wilderness of Kashmir (actually Poland), becomes a mother and shelters Rehaan without knowing who he is.<br>  <br>  Speed attack? More like a flurry of dramatic activity created to convey a sense of urgent doom.<br>  <br>  Oddly, the mid-section of the narrative looks like a poor version of Mission Impossible. Even the background score by Salim-Sulaiman echoes Mission Impossible, making us wonder why the old-world charm of a tender romance had to be compounded by contemporary corruptibility. <br>  <br>  Aamir Khan is certainly more at home playing the eternal romantic than the hardened terrorist. Jehad is topical but only when the director can bring headlines into the plot without bumping into the footnotes.<br>  <br>  Aamir's romantic scenes with Kajol convey a kaleidoscopic chemistry. A major portion of the second-half is shot in a snow-swept cottage. Director Kohli uses the restricted space to great advantage creating a domestic warmth among the four confined characters played by Aamir, Kajol, Rishi and the delightful child actor who gets to mouth some of the most naturally endearing lines to have escaped young unschooled lips on screen.<br>  <br>  The narrative exudes a warm glow of glamour and substance. That silly self-conscious emptiness that had crept into recent romantic films is gone, as we are swept into a stylish yet substantial kingdom of courtship and damnation.<br>  <br>  Yet you cannot escape the web of improbabilities that creep willy-nilly into the otherwise well-ordered plot. <br>  <br>  Critical bits of the story where the female protagonist with newly-restored eyesight encounters her lost paramour in a new surrounding echo the recent flop Amisha Patel-starrer Humko Tumse Pyar Hai.<br>  <br>  Aamir Khan is extremely effective in some sequences, though not consistently compelling in his various transitions and disguises. <br>  <br>  Kajol steals a march over her co-star. She goes from romantic awakening to tragedy and motherhood with skilled smoothness without ever letting her craft shine through.<br>  <br>  But what is the astonishing Tabu doing in this film? As a government agent tracking down a dangerous Kashmiri militant she looks as lost and anorexic as a model on the wrong ramp. Among the supporting actors Rishi Kapoor as Kajol's father is delightful. <br>  <br>  As in his earlier film Mujhse Dosti Karoge, the director here makes endearing use of old film songs to bring the couple closer together. The sound of Lata Mangeshkar's Lag jaa gale se in the background raises the emotional level considerably.<br>  <br>  Star-crossed love never seemed more dramatic in recent times. For this we need to thank the stars.|`|18d1bbe75d8fef2a552ce0fdd7b1041aaa	its a great movie.i think kajol looked more prettier than befrore and i think she going to be a gr8 threat to existin top actresses of bollywood and aamir is as usual very good. the movie overall was not very good but kajol and aamir managed to keep us sittin thru the movie.

They require a person that knows how to play, not just read notes but can express feelings, converse, move the audience to both feel and understand what the musician is playing.<br>  <br>  The trouble with the masses is too often the just hear, but they do not listen.  We hear cars going by, but we do not listen to them.|`|AA11249770	i agree, i was going to say violin. but yah a violin produces a very sad sound, well...hmm...i guess only if your playing with a minor scale. i dont know on that one|`|1e93a21202b034d547968477f56ddaa5aa	flute !!!!! its so ethereal !!!!!|`|878685805781e9012887692f8bc308ceaa	flute. i learned violin and i found its sound too sad to be romantic.|`|AA12394849	violin|`|AA11094129	Violin|`|AA11178712	Depends on what music's being played.

The plot keeps your attention, and it is very addicting.  once you start watching it you are hooked and cant stop.  There isn't anything about that show that i would change.  It is perfect.  Yes there is alot of drama and some people don't like that.  But my life is boring and it could use a little more drama.  And i think it is beivelable.  I mean everything in there is unlikly but it could happen.  There isn't anything on that show that is inpossible.  It just not likly that you will have so many dramatic people in one nieghborhood (well actually they are pretty much all realated so....one family)<br>  i mean, to a julie, and sl**, that is very money hungry, kirsten, and alcoholic, ryan, a misfortuned teen ager that grew up in the wrong envirment, summer, a spoiled princess all in that close circle, that is what makes it not beilevable.|`|6f2d03778cdfd97f93d85698b181d537aa	2 nd|`|df5126652248a43817259f7a82cf1e79aa	the previous ones were more believable i think|`|8d648edc602f4898daa8f94fdbd186cdaa	the first one and also the second one was OK

7da36cb08d6804c379ad587fb99f5253aa	It's me again.  Since you cared enough to ask the same question twice, I will care enough to copy and paste my answer from there to here.<br>  <br>  An RSS reader tracks all of the web sites that you visit on a regular basis, as well as podcasts that you listen to, and then displays new content for you whenever it is available.  RSS readers are handy because instead of visiting 10, 20, or 30 different websites, you can just open up your RSS reader program and all of the content is there for you.  It saves a lot of time.  Not all websites have the ability to notify RSS readers when they post new content.  Websites and podcasts that do have this ability have "RSS feeds".<br>  <br>  So, what does this mean to you?  Say you are absolutely in love with my podcast, you would open up your RSS reader and enter '<a href="http://whitecollarruckus.libsyn.com/rss'" rel="nofollow">http://whitecollarruckus.libsyn.com/rss'</a> into the software.  This tells your reader to check to see if I've posted any new episodes since the last time you ran the reader.  If I have, then you can listen to it right there in the reader.  If I haven't, then nothing will show up and the reader has saved you a useless visit to my website to check for new content.  Most websites that have RSS feeds have RSS links in the form of 'www.<websitename>.com/rss'.<br>  <br>  There are a number of RSS readers out there.  The one that I use, mainly for websites and not for podcasts, is the Google Reader.<br>  <br>  The White Collar Ruckus<br>  <a href="http://whitecollarruckus.libsyn.com" rel="nofollow">http://whitecollarruckus.libsyn.com</a><br>  <br>  (You have to admit this is the best answer.

1c7082dde56e002cd0fb59d2b6789c78aa	Seth works at a comic book store in Newport. Summer is less O.C. and more into the environment. You're going to see 'Greenpeace Summer.' Chris Pratt — aka Everwood's lovable blockhead Bright — will be recurring as Che, an environmentalist that Summer befriends while away at college.    Ryan goes to Vegas to find Trey. Seth is also in Vegas and seems to be living life on the edge, which includes getting a tattoo and drinking too much. Taylor is at Summer's dorm where she meets Amber, Summer's roommate, who is totally unlike them.  Unfortunately, we have to wait a few months before we see Pratt in action.     Julie and Dr. Roberts are still together and living in the same house but things seem iffy.  After having ended things with Doctor Roberts, Julie will go for younger guys, such as her personnal trainer.     16-year-old twins Brad and Eric Ward (Luke's brothers) will make their first appearances as recurring characters in the season premiere. In the season premiere, the twins and Kaitlin go to Newport Plaza to study and smoke a joint.    Ryan accompanies Taylor to a meeting with a French-speaking lawyer. Most of the scene will be in French with English subtitles. It seems that she got married!<br>  As for the person who answered before I did, Ryan found that baby already it was not his.|`|AA11612956	i think that ryan will find out that his ex didnt loose their baby and try to find them.|`|4092825969642821df69379ed0febadfaa	i don't know about that i think that they will go to college. i can't wait for the new season.

1a7a0cf046a8cc88c96c77bdb1c8559daa	There seems to be a lot of activity in the 4th house area of your chart, throughout your life. This includes the home, family, mother, women, land, farms, property, houses, food, cooking, restaurants, homeland, heritage, ancestors, mines and mining.<br>  <br>  Your personality, career, money, partners or spouse, legal matters, sacrifices or debts, are all tied up with your home, house and family in some way. Perhaps also, your mother is a strong influence in your family, or your family may be powerful or prominent.<br>  <br>  Your career may involve one or more of the following: communications, transportation, speaking, writing, publishing, news, information, education, schools, neighbourhoods, trading, business, property, land, farms, agriculture, mines, government, buildings, municipal services, corporations, finances.<br>  <br>  However, Saturn gives you heavy responsibilities and restrictions regarding home and family. There is also conflict between your career and work on the one hand, and your home and family on the other.<br>  <br>  You have good earning power, and can become very wealthy. Your means of income may be connected to one or more of the following, females, fashion, beauty, design, the arts, diplomacy, legal matters, entertainment, leisure, speculation, drama, theatres, children, creative activities, business, banking, insurance.<br>  <br>  You will own houses and land in your lifetime. You will also own cars, maybe even boats. Although you may own property, there will be problems with mortgages, loans, family disputes, and legal wranglings.<br>  <br>  You will probably marry someone from your hometown or country. It may be an arranged marriage, or there is some involvement of your family. Your spouse will be a Pisces type - she may have Sun, Moon, Ascendant or Midheaven in Pisces, or she may be an artist, musician, religious or spiritual person, or may work in hospitals, charities or temples. Your wife may be wealthy herself. The relationship will not be smooth. There is a possibility you may have an affair outside of marriage.<br>  <br>  Your children will grow up to be powerful or prominent. You are likely to have only 1 child. You probably like gambling, though you don't have much luck in this area.<br>  <br>  Your investments generally go well. You may receive or inherit wealth from your mother or her side of the family. Legal matters may present some problems, which are likely to be in connection with partner's money, inheritances, taxes and certain family members.<br>  <br>  You will have powerful friends among professionals, teachers, academics, officials, religious people, legal people, publishers, foreigners. They will be able to help you with your professional as well as personal problems.<br>  <br>  Your secret enemies are local leaders, community leaders, heads, people of rank or position, your superiors or bosses. They may interfere in your life, and cause trouble for you in the home and family, and even in your marriage.<br>  <br>  The above are general forecasts for your future. As it takes too long to do detailed predictions and timings, I have left that out. You may consult a professional astrologer for details.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  .|`|6ca1027218fb6c82cc59080550a0c853aa	No, not even a genuine astrologer can tell the future.

They tell the persons past, meaning the events leading up to their present, and the NEAR future and the events which will lead up to them.  So if you don't like what the future holds you can then take steps to change them.  I don't do them very often for people, but when I do I always write everything down and give the paper to the person so they can see the events happen.  Sometimes the things the cards say don't make any sense at the time of the reading, but as time goes on everything falls into place and the person sees clearly what the cards say.  Anyone can learn this.  Go to www.albitris.com and see if they have a book called universal mind.  These people that I do the cards for tell me the readings  are accurate. I've been hearing this over and over for years.  Don't spend $ on people who might take advantage of you just to get your $,  just learn to do it yourself.  it's easy if you follow the directions.  Like with anything else it gets easier every time you do it.  No, I don't know what makes this method  so accurate.

VjdkaeL7aa	who is the alternative? Are there other viable suitors? If so you can do a dna test with the other likely suspects and narrow it down- another option will be to send the results of your own DNA test to the celebrity in person or their agent with a heartfelt letter and ask that they check.|`|xvCvd5xhaa	I would get a lawyer, then have the lawyer contact him and set up a Paternity test between him, and you, and if it's 100% that he's your father then you can nail him for back child support, and he would have to pay child support till you were 18 not to mention your mom could possibly get him for alimony. I don't know, but that's what I would do. Good luck.|`|SKLh3EYVaa	Yes, it is best if you ask a lawyer. She or he can guide you on what you need to do and will keep it confidential. Good luck.|`|fqfgdtdKaa	I would persue it, at least up to the point where you can find out if this person is your dad or not.  If he's your dad and hasn't been around for this long, he kind of does owe you some kind of support doesn't he?|`|AA10215709	Get in touch with him, make arrangements to meet and then get paternity tests.|`|OV66q85iaa	To avoid embarrassment, here's what you have to do:  1. approach / contact your "alleged" biological father  2. DO NOT approach the press yet or divulge any information to friends, relatives, neighbors or anyone. One word and it will leak!  3. tell your "father" the story your mother told you.  4. it is likely that he will disown you.  5. ask for a paternity test. If he doesn't concur, you can't force him, then that's the end of the road for you.  6. if he agrees, go on and see for yourself.    I'm just a little worried that your "alleged" father might think that you are only approaching him because your mother isn't doing so well and might use him for money. So just a word of caution there, the press might get all over you and you'll end up ruining your life instead of a happy ending. Explain to your "father" that you just want to know the truth.. but there's a 95% probability that he might not want to know the truth. You'd better brace yourself for that.

EBYpwIrlaa	You should pick whichever one interests you the most.  I've played both instruments and I personally like vocals better...  With violin you have to think about carrying around a violin which can be quite annoying especially if you have lessons or do extra-curriculum activities involving your violin at school.  Both should be easier to pick up for you as you have prior musical experience.  With voice you don't have the hassle of extra baggage.  Hope this helps in your decision.|`|0fffe2e7ff7dc3c97a1c8297a89babd2aa	I dont know what is your first instrument but my suggestion is piano!

4c7UlVpPaa	Because Hollywood was created by Russian Jews and their iconic symbol of warship is the "star" of David.     Quotes below are from the LA Times and written by a Jewish writer.  http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/comm...     "All eight major film studios are run by men who happen to be Jewish."    When the studio chiefs took out a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times  to demand that the Screen Actors Guild settle its contract, the open letter was signed by: News Corp. President Peter Chernin (Jewish), Paramount Pictures Chairman Brad Grey (Jewish), Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Robert Iger (Jewish), Sony Pictures Chairman Michael Lynton (surprise, Dutch Jew), Warner Bros. Chairman Barry Meyer (Jewish), CBS Corp. Chief Executive Leslie Moonves (so Jewish his great uncle was the first prime minister of Israel), MGM Chairman Harry Sloan (Jewish) and NBC Universal Chief Executive Jeff Zucker (mega-Jewish). If either of the Weinstein brothers had signed, this group would have had the power to shut down all film production.    Also over 90% of the writers for ALL movies and television show are Jewish or half jewish. The Jewish culture is very strong in everything we read, watch or listen to. Mel Gibson was the first person in decades to defy them when he made the movie The passion of Christ. Every Studio president turned him down and he made the movie with his own money. The movie was the 12th top grossing film in history and non of the studios would let it be made.

AA10058695	No.  In fact, one word answers let your imagination free so that you can write a whole paragraph starting from that one word....  For instance, if I had left only the No as my answer, you would have thought "This silly woman, came in after some absence,  just to give an even sillier one word answer, to get those two points.  Next time she does this, I will have a good word with her!"   Now, that I did not answer with one word, I just gave you a headache!!  Do you prefer it like that??  hmmmm.....  xxxxx|`|LAVy2R8Jaa	ye|`|TZYCbijNaa	Yes, that irritates me when humans do that.

I think there's a minimum of interaction to consider that someone is actually making an effort to answer a question. And most of the times a simple yes or no just doesn't cut it. On the other hand If i only have a one word answer to give, I usually don't answer at all. It goes both ways.

BMQlzUkfaa	Truth exists and is real weather we have discovered it or not.  Fact is our perception of the truth.  A fact may or may not be true. It may only be a part or piece of the truth or not truth at all.      For example, a puzzle.  You see one piece of it and know that in fact it is a piece of the puzzle.  It is not the entire puzzle but only a piece.  The problem comes when the person doing the puzzle looks at the one piece and says, "This is a true puzzle.  Their is no more."     Their is only one that knows all truth and that is God.  He alone understands and can reveal to our minds and hearts the truth of all things.  This he does in a way that cannot be scientifically proved, but none the less is true.  This he does through the Holy Ghost who can reveal the truth of all things to us if it be God's will. Just because we cannot see something or touch something does not mean that it is not real.  Their are physical truths and spiritual truths, but both are true.  When a person denys that their might be another way to know what is true other than the scientific method they are only seeing the one puzzle piece not the whole puzzle.|`|oooxgH7Maa	AWESOME!!!

Muscle activity slows down and slight twitching may occur.    Stage two:Within 10 minutes of light sleep (stage one) we enter True Sleep  the period we spend most of our night in.    Stages three and four: By the time we begin Deep Sleep our body has begun restoring itself to function normally the next day.    Stage five:Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (REM sleep). This is when the brain is at its most active and when dreams occur. REM usually begins about 70 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. We have around three to five REM episodes a night. After REM sleep, the whole cycle begins again.    Yes, it is true  we do need around eight hours of sleep a night to perform optimally. If you can only manage six, your ability to function normally will only be slightly impaired, so long as this is a one-off occasion.

I was prescribed a 1200 calorie (+/- 5200kJ) diet per day and about 3 to 4 times of exercise a week where it's about 60-70% cardio and the remaining is strength and toning exercise.    It's helped a lot and I lost about the same weight as sanfrang.. except I'm used to kg's :) 12 and a bit kg's.    Just watch your intake of oily foods, meat and pasta's. Opt for fat free yoghurt and milk (it makes a difference) skinless chicken and batterless fish. brown rice, wholewheat bread.    Eating cereal in a small bowl (about a cup volume) helps you to control your serving size!    Avocado and small amount of low sugar peanut butter are healthy fats. Opt for 5 fruits and veggies a day. Eat wholewheat (not digestive) biscuits with low fat melrose spread. It can be easy - just have willpower and hobbies or work to distract your mind from food :)    The exercise has made me feel lighter and I can actually see my ribs! Lost just over a pants size. Hope it will help. You can do it ;) good luck.|`|WjRqYf6naa	I've been on a 2500 calorie ADA (American Diabetic Association) diet since I was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes in 2006.

Eat loads of leafy and green vegies too as they are rich in both calcium & magnesium (magnesium is known as the antistress mineral) and will increase the production of hydrochloric acid in your tummy thus aiding in digestion and eliminating constipation.    Eat your green vegies like broccoli, spinach, celery, kale, chard raw if you can as cooking devitalises them ...... or lightly steamed ..... brilliant for regulating your system......... good for brain frizz and stress too.    Eat some low sugar fruits such as watermelon, pears, strawberries and blackberries.    Eat a handfull of organic almonds, brazil nuts or sunflower seeds each day as they are all rich in both calcium and the essential fatty acids (which will bolster your immunity and even out your mood levels for you).    organic with the nuts and seeds to avoid the sulfites and other nasty chemicals they use in the commercial varieties to "preserve" them .... and will upset sensitive digestive systems.    You only need an amount of lean meat the size of your palm each day to meet your iron requirements...... don't forget about your iron or you'll end up exhausted, moody and headachy......eat fresh tuna, salmon or sardines 2 or 3 times a week also as they are rich in calcium and magnesium.    Drink loads of fresh filtered water each day as well ...... at least 2 - 3 litres as you'd be amazed at how being just a little dehyrated can affect your weight loss efforts, mood and energy levels.    Cut out the sodas and pop and diet soft drinks too as they contain an awful load of sugar, will dehydrate you terribly  and really don't have any nutritional value anyways.    Don't consume anything containing the artificial chemical sweetner aspartame either .......... A lot of people react badly after ingesting foods and drinks labelled "diet" items as they usually contain an artificial chemical sweetner called aspartame.......... aspartame.......... the truth about aspartame is that it is an insidious sweet chemically enhanced sugar that will cause all sorts of devastating side affects if consumed in enough quantities.    Seems ludicrous to me that something that is marketed to help you lose weight will in actual fact help you to gain weight ........... what aspartame does is block the satiety receptors in your brain (you know that feeling of satiety ie ~ having had enough to eat or drink??) thus making you unaware of the fact that you're not hungry anymore and you will most times simply keep eating .................. ***brrrr shudders*** ...... avoid that nasty stuff like the plague ... it's pure & simple sludge for your body i reckon .......... it also causes a devastating list of side affects.    There is a vast amount of very usefull and insightfull information on this website ......... the site is labelled as a detox programme but the information on documented side affects is the part that should be of most use to you ~    http://www.sweetpoison.com/aspartame-sid...      The list of side affects are hideous to say the least.    Don't eat food labelled low fat or diet as they are usually higher in man made chemically processed sugar to account for the taste factor that is lost when they reduce the fat.    use a teaspoon of raw organic honey in your hot drinks if you need to ... natural will always be the best way to go.    Munch on fresh raw vegies such as carrotts and celery for snacks .....  loads of tips there mate ...... don't do it all at once ...... or the detox will be nasty ....... baby steps moves mountains you know......;0)    peace baby  ?

M3Xmqlt8aa	According to the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy 42 is the answer to the most important question ever asked by mankind. The problem turned out to be that they had long ago forgotten what the question was. So it is the answer that explains everything, we just do not know what context to use it in.|`|p8iDpFwAaa	42 indeed|`|kOAXmQ51aa	nope, it's probably 69! lol|`|LoRgAmc6aa	It's the answer to "What is 22 + 20?"

Jerusalem covers 42 square miles.  But most telling is the fact that Elvis died at age 42.  How much more proof do you need that 42 is indeed the answer to life, the universe and everything.  Now, if we only knew the question...|`|02797a7699a7653821ce2dbd3ba78a2eaa	thats soo cute...having sperm falling from the sky followed by potted plants haha is that ur ideal world?    maybe 42 light years is the answer to everythng|`|zmQsZ4rGaa	no its 27|`|7dedb1d505bc774b219a42c84ed2ca4caa	I think I must have woken up to the wrong parallel universe today    Y!A is just weird|`|AA12134591	Absolutely not....

nci2WOYXaa	3/4|`|ci64gIZ8aa	4.5 out of 5  This movie made me laugh and cry at the same time. It deals with both grimy old bastards as well as with more serious matters as racism. Good acting from Clind as well as all his supporting actors and once again Clint has shown that he is capable of making movies that involves both emotions and stereotypes! The "olidish" bitterness of Clint's character and the mix between comedy and drama is just genius. The only criticism of the movie would be that the gang-bangers were pretty and does not correspond very well to all of the reports of gang violence all around the world. But overall I thought this was a great movie with lots of potential for being one of those films that you will actually remember when you visit the video rental store in five years from now.|`|Xjc1uAdaaa	from 1 to 10 i give 8|`|pNY6xXb5aa	Yeah 8 out of 10, great movie!|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	4 out of 5. It was entertaining, but it didn't contain that much depth. The acting was just ok: Clint is playing a variation on other characters he's played and the Hmong kids weren't much better than adequate.     But don't misunderstand me, I liked GRAN Torino and I strongly recommend it to just about anyone over the age of 15 or so.|`|irbJMnItaa	Yea its a great movie 4-5 its funny when he tells a joke about those guys walk in the bar and the bartender says get the fcuk out my bar

Cddqq9dBaa	Lol! I eat the whole shrimp besides the shell. People might think it's funny because you might be eating the poop shoot. Most of the time when you get shrimp from a restaurant or a store they are deveined. Which means they pull out the vein (poop shoot) where all the waste from what the shrimp ate is. You can see if a shrimp has been deveined or not. That's why sometimes some might taste better than others.     Check out this video: http://video.google.com/videosearch?hl=e...|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Anything that isn't shell, is fine. Well, except the 'vein' aka poop.|`|IaK4SRHpaa	I've tried eating them but they're just a little too "crunchy" for me.  So my answer would have to be no.|`|J7VPM23Xaa	Of course I eat the tail.  Not the shell on the tail, but the meat inside it.  It's wasteful to throw that away.......if I've paid for it, I'm going to eat it.|`|re06t6zvaa	um no, i usually just throw that part.|`|gm3SlwTcaa	um thats the only part i eat... lol|`|jeXlZ0sSaa	I don't eat the shell, and I only eat the crunchy part of the tail when it's fried haha.  If it's boiled or whatever, then the tail is a bit crunchy for me.|`|1xr6T6h0aa	um, don't you usually eat the tails?  i always have...     i'd skip the shell though...|`|HiZF7QmYaa	i eat all of them including the head... emm, it is my choice, who cares... right?    it's not funny lol, some people even eat strange foods for example, dog meats and monkeys... ^^ and that's what we call hilarious... ^^|`|5zQppwxhaa	No, but some people do

Had to learn it the hard way..|`|EYqTV2EYaa	I know about hating it because I never used it, but when I was registering, it told I couldn't use a password containing letters, numbers, and symbols as I usually do, nor could I register as 'Ms. Opinionative."

E6OFX15Maa	Lmao, when I was about 5 in pre-school I saw this kid and I dunno, I decided to push him. So I did, causing him to fall into this big shelf full of crayons, glue, paper, you name it. IT WENT EVERYWHERE! Ah, that was so funny. XD|`|xGxDFcT5aa	Well it's not my worst.  I went threw the same ***** cell phone 2-3 times because I HATED it with passion and just couldn't stand it. One time I hid it under my bed and said I lost it and then a week later as I was walking to school (I walk through a park), well... you see... this park had a garbage can... I kinda "dropped" my phone in there thinking I would get a better one from my parents. I knew I would get another one cuz I'm a spoiled piece of **** but need a phone, like actualy... But then I ended up with the exact same one, lol. Well this time I was at school and it was almost like a blizzard on my way to the bus stop so again I sorta "dropped" my phone... I never found it when the snow melted either? lol. And now I have the LG Keybo and absolutly love it! I could never again go back to that ***** flip phone :P|`|9ijwrcTZaa	Well first of all I was ******* (banging) my brothers wife.  This went on for about 5 years.      If that wasnt bad enough, one night we had a snowstorm.  We only lived a block away from my brothers apartment.  Anyway, he fell on the ice on a Friday night and hit his head pretty hard.  He came over to the house and my mom did some basic first aid, put a cold compress on his swollen head.  She asked me to go over and help my sister in law take out the rest of the groceries.  Well, while my brother was recrupriating at my house, his wife and I decided to go ahead and **** on the kitchen table.  I spread her out, did some oral, then did her right there.  I finished both tasks, went back home like nothing......|`|mdzIjOqaaa	I cut down a cherry tree.

You're allowed to rent too many movies, and it makes the service boring after a while.     Red Box is much better. The selection isn't as good though.

D7KwEaoXaa	Fork and spoon    Take some of the spaghetti with your fork, slide it onto your spoon, then twist. It twists the normal way, except the spoon causes it to ALL twist, instead of all hanging off your fork.    To get it to your mouth without a huge mess, tip the fork and spoon sideways, and twist until most of it is balanced on top. Then you can pretty safely lift it to your mouth with no mess.     The key is to not put too many strands of spaghetti on the fork before you twist. 6 or 7 is all you need. Once you get better at it, you can brave more :) I recommend NOT cutting it up, you'll have more loose strands sticking out. Take fewer strands to twist, and keep them long.    Here is the You Tube video of EXACTLY how to do it :)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw7ShNLtV...    Good luck!|`|LoRgAmc6aa	Chop them up a bit before eating so they won't be so long.|`|NlulTfFOaa	Spin a small amount of noodles around a fork using a spoon.|`|mtyhSPi9aa	use the spoon on ur right hand and the fork on ur left hand  roll up the spaghetti to the fork and eat it  best way is to handle the spoon under the fork in case anything spills or topples over back into the plate  so yeah|`|jbLDPyK8aa	I roll mine on a table spoon.|`|DGk7Wszmaa	Just enjoy -lol.|`|QGu1JrNZaa	cut the pastas|`|21r2KmDFaa	Take the fork and twirl it into the noodles in small rotations into the curve of a spoon until the noodles have caught into the clasps of the fork and stragetically wound themselves around one another. Repeat this until they have made a small sphere or ball of noodles around the fork, temporarily remove the spoon and be sure that the width of the  sphere is not bigger than your mouth and then take the compact twist and eat up. :) !|`|0GB2sWA0aa	cut them  roll w/ fork and spoon|`|14gi4aTvaa	Roll them up with a fork and eat it that way.|`|7swefA6Paa	in italy they eat with a fork and spoon  you roll the noodles into the spoon then stick fork in your mouth    ive been to italy|`|KH9bbeCNaa	spaghetti? wat is that? is it asian? it sounds middle eastern, where is the middle east? is it next to africa? am i african? am i from North Africa? is there a place called North Africa? I know South Africa is there, its next to the South pole, right? is the South pole north or south of the equator? where is the equator? is it in Australia? oh yes it does pass somewhere in the northen territory? right? is there a southern terriory in Australia? wat is australia, did Nostradamus make it? is nostradamus dead? did he predict 9/11? OMG! it all comes back to 9/11, so spaghetti caused 9/11, and the world blamed Al Qaeda.... sad...|`|7hrOjPwjaa	Best way to eat pasta is with both a fork and a spoon.  Grab some strands of pasta with your fork and then put the tip of the fork into the concave section of the spoon. Now twist the fork so that the strands of pasta wrap around the fork. Place in mouth and enjoy!|`|KaOIK0AXaa	i just try to roll it on a fork very neatly, its hard to do..when im with someone im comfy with i jsut let it get messy cus i dont care.. but yah juat try to roll a little bit on your fork at a time.|`|w51B05ACaa	hah i think it's impossible.. i hate going out somewhere and eating it.. it's so hard! i always end up spilling it on my shirt, or on my face.. is it just me or is anyone else like this? i have problems with spaghetti haha

Here in Asia, my country for example real straight men wears light foundation/powder starting during high school. And it's not being gay or what, they call those men metrosexuals, they're for either hygiene purposes or just to look good in front of everyone. Im not saying all men are doing it but there are a lot. and for a full make up like eyeshadows with colors pink, purple or gold glitters, i dont think it's happen. lol|`|14gi4aTvaa	When all guys get infected with a disease called GAY!

eJBu8765aa	Oh I'm sure you don't want to hear this - but I'm sure you already know it. Character, humor, spirit - thats what makes someone shallow or not. And you can find shallowness as well in men as in women.|`|qLvhoRpsaa	Okay, well I think that it is men, and I will explain why. It is not shallow as in only into themselves and selfish. It is more about that men to not think about things as deeply or as much as us women usually do. Now of course, there are exceptions to every rule, but men have very basic needs, wants and desires to be happy and content. Peace:)|`|ja7J2cE2aa	Both of us are far too shallow for our own good.  It's really just a question of which of us is willing to "just settle for something else."      ...And it seems that guys have an easier time of doing it.  We don't try and change others quite as often as women do.|`|rGVLrkEAaa	women|`|IHa6FxE6aa	Women.|`|y999LLxdaa	Men|`|AA11783467	The most shallow people are those pathetic ones that ask questions like this.

I don't mind as long as their nice. More to love is also nice :) But men won't go near women unless their skinny/pretty/hot. So i think that it's a close call really. Maybe women a bit more then men, so yes. x|`|QGb4U6ZUaa	women and men are still fine...  BUT AN OLD WOMAN?|`|VSzF36Ywaa	That would be a terrible generalisation to make.    And it's feet. And muscles. Please learn to spell before you try expressing your offensive and incomplete  theories.|`|tp2teUEKaa	good question, but in my opinion both men and women are shallow.  saying all men want is a skinny girl, is not even right.  yes, they may want a skinny girl, but that is not all they want.  they want the smokin hot blonde with the curves and T and A.      But everyone is different.  some people aren't as "shallow" as the next person.      And you do have to think that because some people are very shallow and superficial, they are single and don't know why.      sorry, i rant quite a bit, but it is true.|`|45o6Z25Paa	men|`|AA10741077	puddles|`|2mIhQgV7aa	I'm a woman ... but...

Seriously being one gender or another doesn't make you more vain and superficial.  Not all women are like you described, you just gotta look harder for them :).  Just like not all guys want long legs, big t*ts etc. (if so I'm screwed :P.)      In my personal preference, I don't like full on muscley, tall guys.  From what I've seen, they reckon they can get any girl they want.  I prefer to go for the underdog.    However main thing is personality, and respect.|`|GNqQnAy9aa	Know it alls of either gender who think they can build "mussels"|`|yOTSC7Vxaa	Both. Sorry to say.    In the past I'd hear about a lot of guys who cheat on their girlfriends/wives - so I thought it would just be the men but now it seems, the tables have turned.    From what I've seen in friends' and colleagues' love lives, it actually hurts to know the people who cheat on their lovers and have masters/mistresses on the side.    I discourage my friends/colleagues not to maintain those kind of relationships but unfortunately, it's their own decision to make. One of them already got hurt when the married guy felt guilty and stopped it.    I question myself to whether I should get married in future :(

Lf3wiwsNaa	I think they are trying to get lots of answers by stating that...  some of them don't even come back and the ten points go to the voters choice.    Kinda pointless to state since YA always gives 10 points to best answer.|`|9473d8cbba68590d77db53e5d76ed1fdaa	so that many/others will be encouraged to ans. his question and like..EVERYBODY aim for the 10 pts.!...  but really anybody [just 1!] who'd been picked as d best ans., they'll be given 10 pts. no more, no less.|`|f720effbe87ab6144e931e7eb47322eaaa	to draw attention to their question. so they get more answers or stars.    you can't get anymore or less then 10 points when your answer is chosen as the best.    sarah b    x|`|GQ8J44fSaa	Yeah you can get more for 1) answering a question or having a "thumbs up". You can also loose points by saying a question or getting a "thumbs Down". if you rate it (the person who asks the question) the answer can get points so that's why people say 10 points for best answer.|`|cdfab17577ad8962b270c540b0b46e98aa	So that the people answer the question with more detail.|`|be31fda76eec8c99ba297ce2f3f70329aa	i guess because they want a lot of people to answers... but i mean, its just points, its not that big of a deal. its not real money or anything. some people are just weird.|`|d0e1b5b2af884d02c8c1a86fcdf900caaa	I think it's because the asker has the option to choose the best answer as opposed to the voters giving thumbs up and down, which then decides the best answer. Some askers leave it up to the voters, some choose the best answer themselves.|`|5agXk9ldaa	for advertiaing|`|s3FUR37xaa	to catch their attention.|`|Yyt8ZjU2aa	because they're gay and retarded.    next question? lol|`|JbqcXcVpaa	Because You Need To Get Me 10 Points Before I Answer :P|`|3i7bN6PFaa	I know, it makes me laugh.  It's like, oh really, I had no idea!|`|I0RInW57aa	to make it seem worthwhile answering|`|XUwtAWzkaa	Because people are points hungry... If your strictly trying to raise your lvl and your see something like that you're more likely to work harder on finding the answer because that person has basically guaranteed that you will get 10 points ( best answer ) if yours is the best.|`|7h5TiJzFaa	When you choose the answer that you believe best answers your question, the user who provided that answer will then receive ten points.  You can receive no more and no less.    And yes, it is automatic.    My guess would be that people only do that to motivate real, honest answers instead of some stupid crap like some people leave.

srtoPxN2aa	Mono Sodium Glutamate (MSG). In many countries it's been used for years as a flavour enhancer/preservative. Some manufacturers add this garbage to their meat products, processed sandwich meats, Bologna, salami, hot dogs, pepperoni, etc. I find that depending on the amount consumed, I become congested, with the sniffles, my throat passage is restricted, and slightly irritated. Many Chinese restaurants are known for using MSG as well, and if there is an option on the menu I will choose it. If not, I will ask them not to add it to my food.    BQ: For over 20 years now I've started each morning with a healthy bowl of oatmeal made from whole oats...the stuff you need to cook for 10-15 minutes...not the instant, or "quick oats". I'll top it off with some local unpasteurized honey. I find it gives me the energy required for the first part of my day, and it's not greasy, loaded with sugars, or bloating like bread.  My Grandparents lived to be nearly 100 years old on my Mothers side, and this was part of their daily routine also.

Usually the understanding comes at the end. But there have been many films I've given up on because they just didn't hold my interest. This is especially true of movies I've watched at home on DVD. The Last Emperor is the most recent example.    Aditya K: I don't understand how Slumdog Millionaire was an insult to India. Unless you consider it an insult for showing the truth.     Is it false that there are huge slums like that in Mumbai? I doubt that since I can see them with Google Earth and because I've seen reports about them in many places.    Is it false that some unscrupulous people with prey upon the poor and uneducated children and exploit them for financial gain? This happens in many parts of the world, and I'm sure it happens in India.    Is it false that someone raised in a slum, who wasn't well educated, and had no money could rise up to better themselves in a decent job in a modern company?    Is it false that organized crime exists in Mumbai and other parts of India?    Is it false that Indian people don't believe in true love? That they won't go to their limits to find it?    To be honest with you, the parts of Slumdog that some people are protesting were a non-issue to me when I watched the movie. I was engaged in the fictional story of these kids, but I didn't take everything that happened to them at face value as an example of how children in the slums of India live. Along the same lines, I don't take American action movies as a literal statement about American society.

There is nothing hot whatsoever about the Jonas Brothers. Why little girls worship them, I have no idea! But they are little girls, they'll grow out of it.

Miley Cyrus is extremely annoying and she pisses me off a lot but I am not going to judge her. I don't believe in hate.  The Jonas Brothers are kind of annoying but better than Miley.

KBnhvH0maa	"To Live Is to Die" is a mostly instrumental composition by heavy metal band Metallica from their 1988 album And Justice for All. Since the release of Death Magnetic, "Suicide & Redemption", claims the title for longest original Metallica song at 9:57, although this new track is still shorter than "The Outlaw Torn (Unencumbered by Manufacturing Restrictions Version)" (10:48) which was released on "The Memory Remains" single.
eca4c567b412164e4b3f2d62944e6871aa	No not at all. Maybe all your friends are into " different" music but never be ashamed of what your likes and dislikes are . Don't try to like something different just to fit in. Stop trying to please everyone else. just be yourself.|`|3956c292d9898cc425bc25b7923184b7aa	NO.  ITS GOOD TO KNOW THE CLASSICS.  Check out some Bob Dylan if you like Croce.|`|kN31jvVaaa	Hell no.  I'm 19 and I love people like Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Elton John, Public Enemy, and Bob Dylan!|`|c88d6a4b2e8a26ac9bd239980605f6f8aa	I don't think it is bad that you are 19 and like Jim Croce's music. I am 67 and have liked Jim Croce since the late 1960's when I was 30. Like Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, and Elvis Presley, Croce knew how to "sing a life".

Iron Maiden still is better. So is Metallica, Slayer, the list can go on and on....|`|Ga8sGuyRaa	Nope sorry, they're up there though. Slipknot are the best!    http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=_rs7UFfKGi... I was there!|`|ONuy5vniaa	no, for 2 reasons.    -no "nu-metal" band can ever be the best.    -every disturbed album sounds the same.    But I do like them.|`|Y8TS6Do0aa	Disturbed is a good starting point, I suppose. Always look for something new and better! I am content to know that in five years, all of my favorite artists will be replaced by newer (to me) and better artists!    Investigate older metal (go back to the roots! Understand Zeppelin and King Crimson's influence on metal), investigate art metal (Sleepytime Gorilla Musem), see where Disturbed came from and check out some more Industrial sound (and understand how it ties into everything).    There is no such thing as "the best ever." There is what you like, and what you don't. Always attempt to expand your musical understanding by listening to new music. Use Disturbed as a starting point, and investigate their relation to other groups!|`|yS61H04haa	Rohit get a like????      The best of metal? i think not. Dave Draiman has a great voice but the band is mediocre at best. I think they have potential but choose to remain in the "largely forgettable " category. To me they are kids metal.|`|J7PuZ7GIaa	one of the best these are awesome too:  linkin park  mindless self indulgence  3 days grace  system of a down  bullet for my valentine  my chemical romance  slipknot  30 seconds to mars  the used  metallica  9 inch nails  eluvite|`|GXYYv22qaa	HELLLLLLLLLLL no.     They're alright.    Try slayer, Judas Priest, Metallica, Iron Maiden then you're shooting for the ballpark. I don't consider disturbed heavy metal, they're more hard rock in my opinion.|`|OX6XHwsraa	Oh Yeah Julz      oh  Yeaaaah  Disturbed just don't cut it  in the history of music no one can approach the scary talents of SLIPKNOT    are you S @tting Me?  why don't you keep your Neanderthal  opinions to yourself..  GOD, don't you dare pretend to know what your talking about...  I know your type, yeah Radiohead or the Beatles Suck, Slipnot rules.... (yawn)    Edit; see you got several thumbs down  very nice quite well deserved|`|TUxPf25vaa	not even close  but i guess its all opinion|`|12QJ9QMRaa	I like Disturbed OK, but from pretty much any standpoint short of personal preference they fall far short of "Best Ever".    They are not the Heaviest.  They are not the most melodic.  The most Tchnical.  Experimental.  Brutal  High Energy.      What they are is pretty decent mainstream NuMetal.    Are they even close to being better than Meshuggah, Therion, Nightwish, Iron Maiden, Dark Tranquility, Slayer, etc, or even other NuMetal like SevenDust or TapRoot?    Nope.  But unlike Slipknot and the other Poseur MallMetal bands at least they don't pretend to be something they are not.    In fact, the Singer doesn't even consider them to be Metal anymore.  Just Heavy Alt Rock.|`|oOSNI3wbaa	are they the best heavy metal ever? NO. but they are very good and i AM a disturbed fan. they do kick ***. will be seeing them in st. petersburg.|`|vlIXsFmhaa	No no no no. They are terrible. Overplayed corporate bulsh it/ It allsounds the same    They arent even the best metal band that starts with D    haha so far only girls like them and guys dont.....what do 14 year old girls know about metal? ask yourself that and listen to everyone else    Listen to Pantera, Metallica, Slayer, and Sepultura if you dont want to look like an idiot like you do now|`|yuqZ6M96aa	no|`|Rds4eGIyaa	No, I do like disturbed but they are nu-metal which is really more like hard rock.|`|283tO9j9aa	No man, not the best. They're okay, just not amazing. They're good for getting people into metal though.    My personal favourite is Black Sabbath. Yeah I know, they're not the angriest band but they were the first band you could call metal. 1970s doom :P
2F939JONaa	Ween.    The first song i heard was "Push The Little Daisies". Hated It.    Ween are now 1 of my favourite bands, with many amazing songs.    "Push The Little Daisies And Make em Come Up"|`|wuTXOkFIaa	I used to dislike Guns n Roses when I was a kid because of Axel (his voice was really annoying for me, at that time) but then I started to learn the guitar and began to listen to them, Slash became one of my favorite guitar players|`|ChSrd2ftaa	I made fun of George Michael.

Because even though I love Scrubs, the characters in House are so complex and just when you think you've worked them out they do something completely out of left-field.

Using Yahoo Answers|`|CiBmKjbUaa	I used to work in a bar and got up to all sorts, I wasn't as nice a guy as I am now back then you see. I gave my mates free drinks, overcharged people and eventually worked out my quick math skills meant I could charge the customer the right price, then miss a drink or two off the bill when I rang it in the till, easy to do especially when it's busy. I also noticed that a little red light came on the fruit machine when it was full, and therefore ready to pay out the 20 jackpot, so I would steal a few quid from the till, go on a break, win the jackpot and then replace the money, I must have done that about 20 times before the manager cottoned on and banned me off them (he didn't know I was stealing the money to play with, he just figured out I knew when the jackpots were comming).  I also worked at a theme park for a week or so and my sister worked their for years. I was on ticket sales and my sister was on the door so I figured out I could sell them a ticket, then if they paid in cash I could void the ticket, give them the voided ticket and my sister would let them in on the dodgy ticket, it worked a charm and we made a f*cking bundle, in 1 week we took home over 1,000, and only about 300 of that was an earnt wage, lol.

abd2e432d2e62ef9142b462ae292bcbbaa	Poop on it.|`|o8o689x5aa	That's easy. Pour a family sized box of Rice Krispies on it. The sound of snap-crackle and pop will scare it away.|`|TDo1EMJkaa	Tapdance in it.|`|k1Aio2qdaa	smother it in toilet paper....babe|`|sVnq4iAraa	Just like your profile baby you Sham Wow it HAHAHA!!!|`|slMIQcWMaa	wipe it off the seat...I guess some individuals just cannot help marking their territory in the public restroom|`|2WFzTTAzaa	Cat litter

The souls of the dead do not and cannot communicate with the living.  It is illogical to think so outside the spectrum of creative writing.          xoxo  ?|`|3YE1f7Foaa	noooooo i think they whisper to me,     Ice - cold, stagnant, frozen, and unchanging. This rune suggests heat removed not just from anger or conflict, but from passion as well. Paradoxically, Isa conveys images of slippery slopes and unsure footing, but also of circumstances that have crystallized and become utterly immutable. Remember that in the cold north, ice is not just THE challenge to be overcome, but the very nature of the environment. Be courageous, for you work against this element every day. Will you fight alone or with others against this, our common foe? Is there much worse than lack of change?   The right rune represents another of the forces acting on the issue at hand. Othila is the homeland. Unlike Fehu, this is the rune of immovable wealth. On a deeper level, this rune speaks to that which you inherit, be it material or genetic. Since Othila is seen reversed here, the obstacles you confront are among those things in your background that you take for granted and consider fairly stable. Problems from the "homeland", from familial inheritance, or from our own origins may be worked around, but they cannot be made to go away. Fortunately, for many problems, this is all that is required.   The top rune represents the conclusion to which your strivings can carry you. Perth, the rune of chance and gambling has been drawn reversed. This can have many possible meanings. It could represent secrets revealed or mysteries uncovered. It could be a warning against gambling - now might not be the time to take a chance.|`|lgIuhKN4aa	No we shout at each other.|`|h7F4wA7eaa	Uh not really you can believe in ghost but your not supposed to fool around with wiggi boards and stuff! because you might open something you cant deal with!|`|2WFzTTAzaa	No, they're telepathic.

Do you recomend it?|`|r8s5j6zOaa	yes and get the ripe ones|`|ec5e2cfdd5364a1a67d973613c5d9480aa	No. But, if I did it would be over something terrible about to happen to us like a passing tornado or someone shooting at us.

6380221dbceb0381d89b54bd786e9f42aa	Oh man. IF you get an honest and decisive answer, PLEASE share.  My wife and her mother are horrible at that.  "Who's this guy now? Why did he blow up that gas station?"       I can count on zero fingers the times I've asked her something about some God forsaken girlie movie I'm forced to sit through. Ugh.|`|AA11097657	Lol      I do that. I ask because I don't understand whats going on and think I might have missed something in a moment where my mind wandered.|`|tFfUMQtyaa	Shhh I am watching a movie.  Only kidding..... It is yet another annoying "Woman trait" they have 1000,s of them (Sigh)|`|ta1ALj4qaa	Boredom?|`|l6Kii2Uiaa	Shhhhhh, no talking during the movie! Hey what is that man doing now?

The average movie is designed to match the average IQ of a man, so it goes too slow for a woman to really keep her entertained. She asks irrelevant questions to fill the time.|`|IVN49C1vaa	we like to talk?    x|`|vmlArXqAaa	thats not as bad as when men always try and predict the next thing that will happen. they keep getting it wrong but continue to predict things as if trying to redeem themselves of the failed prediction like it MATTERS. so annoying.|`|lgIuhKN4aa	I don't.   I hate when people talk a lot during films.|`|UmAM1cW8aa	I dont talk durin a movie!|`|5MeggG3Laa	its all for attention|`|XEGG1l6Raa	not all women are like that Steve.    im not. i keep my mouth shut because talking too much annoys people.
baQpo0kdaa	lol|`|IHa6FxE6aa	You couldn't beat a drum.|`|l6Kii2Uiaa	You did the right thing, she would have gained nothing from false belief that she was better than you.|`|yM7YPmzSaa	No she left you because she found someone better....ME!!!|`|qh9EOXKOaa	OMG did you do that on F****** purpose that is soooooo what's the word STUPID|`|nj6H2Qjpaa	Lol! Yep, you must just be too good for her to handle honey|`|ByktJQpOaa	You should have let her win a few points Steve. Ask for a re-match...|`|AA11097657	You were trying to mislead us there.    No wonder she left you you like to play games too much.|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	I don't think that she left you over the beating, but I sure that that didn't help|`|9ijwrcTZaa	.....and now the only thing your beating is your meat..|`|JA2Eq4Ypaa	Your a fag|`|mqcVaxMvaa	no it's because your sense of humor is stupid.|`|KUZrSrrBaa	hahahaha|`|HFXQ8aUzaa	Yes.|`|P7pZo7Ztaa	Wow, when i first read that i thought you meant beating like bashing her up. But now that i know that you meant beating her at a sport it is different. Some people are very competitive and feel uncomfortable and inadequate if they lose especially in front of people who matter to them. But as for her leaving you about it, i think that there would have to be something else going on. Maybe you should try talking to her about it, or one of her close friends.|`|efvHNxN0aa	well i think ur ex is such a looser maybe u should find another one theres a lot girls who's good in tennis w/ good sportmanship like me..lolz|`|b588ea9ae577d8516ac0cfb6e137875baa	I left my girlfriend as she was a good boxer.

When she beat me, she actually beat me :'(|`|vbJNPvayaa	Nice One|`|ra793Y2Uaa	maybe she was a sore loser|`|SsEOTFLRaa	pmsl i thought you meant beating as in hitting slapping punching Lol but as your on about tennis us women like to win then we brag that u were sh!te lol     was she hitting the tennis balls back with her racket or was u aiming for her head lol|`|caea98f7ed2871cd6caf9a1f351fc5ddaa	it could be or she may have found someone with a bigger.....................................                        personality|`|Uh2vfl5Uaa	Yeah, thats probably it.|`|kecdkv6jaa	hmmmm...Very mis-leading!!

494a7a701dcb960d4740e929d5b8b41daa	1. Survivor Guatemala    2.  It is just an island, where the contestant must find thier own shelter, food, and bulid a fire.    3.  One cannot make a deal with another contestant to spilt the winnings in order to get further in the game, they must not talk about the game until after the episodes are aired,     4.  Yes; The Outback refers to remote arid areas of Australia, although the term colloquially can refer to any lands outside of the main urban areas. The term "the outback" is generally used to refer to locations that are comparatively more remote than those areas deemed "the bush".    5.   The Outcast tribe consisted of players who had been voted out were allowed to return to the game as part of the Outcast Tribe.  OUTCASTS TRIBAL COUNCIL: BURTON & LILLIAN VOTED BACK IN   In a historic Tribal Council, members ousted from Drake and Morgan convened as the newly formed Outcasts tribe with the objective of voting two castaways back into Morgan and Drake. Each Outcasts member made their plea as to why they should be voted back into the game. After a close vote, Burton Roberts, the 31-year-old marketing executive from San Francisco, California, and Lillian Morris, the 51-year-old scout troop leader from Cincinnati, Ohio, won the honors of returning to the game. After randomly selecting who would go to which tribe, it was determined that Burton would return to Drake and Lill would return to Morgan     6. I am not sure about this one.  I am sorry.  But each episode, from every season is recap on the official survivor website    7. It was hidden near camp.  Gary Hogeboom found it up in a tree,

hFKH6GIYaa	basically you want to do something big. an adventure. but something happened that made you realize that just running off to do anything you want just can't happen right now. Instead of being sad about that, slowly work out a plan to make your dreams happen.|`|4GmeIopoaa	It's telling you to not get too carried away with your emotions.|`|s3gBSCcQaa	I think it's telling you to stop reading and believing this crap. That's my interpretation of 'scale back your vision to a more pragmatic level'.|`|NVtYLxY3aa	i think it means that there was an event that inspired you and made you do some things that you thought you could do but you couldn't do after all. and so you realize that taking one step at a time was the wisest decision.

7294c9edbf7c247468b6e48776c6fcadaa	In a conventional war If Russia invaded the U.S. the U.S. would win.  If the U.S. invaded Russia then Russia would win. Right now we do not even have the troop strength to maintain enough forces in Iraqi and Afghanistan at the same time let alone get in a shooting war with Russia.     In a thermo nuclear war, every body in the northern hemisphere just bend over a kiss your rear ends good bye.   Everything north of the equator would fried to a crispy critter.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Russia, they are a rich country but appear to be poor, they spend all their money on weapons|`|Xi5eJGKGaa	USA...because of the secret alien technology hidden at area 51 :||`|4SGBr8cWaa	mutual destruction|`|YDXITLv1aa	russia.    they have more nukes and less morals.|`|ozpB4ADVaa	Tough one - but I still think USA.  We have more sophisticated weapons. We are better trained.  But both countries have nukes - so it is a tough decision to make!|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	If nukes were taken out off the Equation, Id say Russia, because they have China, NK, Cuba Bolivia Venezuela etc on their side.    America would have some of the EU + Britain + maybe the Commonwealth and Israel, I doubt Israel could/would support the US.  Iran and Israel will fight, the UAE and other Arab states may be neutral.  NATO would not act uniformly, some would fight, others will watch and some help.     There would never be a call for this war unless for diminishing world resources, and that is more likely to be between the EU and Russia or a major war starting from a proxy war like the Georgian one.|`|AA10741077	As far as missile defense systems the US has the advantage over Russia. I would say maybe the US, if not MAD aka Mutually Assured Destruction.|`|qrx6PhFDaa	honestly, i think that russia would dominate because obama is not yet ready for that pressure...and the economy in russia is better overall too, plus they have the advantage of more land mass, and most likely MUCH more weaponry, but in the aftermath, both countries would suffer greatly from it, and either way, if the USA won or lost, my prediction is that a one last blow would cause it to crash. and well...say goodbye to low insurance rates XD|`|Ps2tufsoaa	We would all lose.  That's why it didn't already happen, everyone knew that it would destroy the world.  If we limit it to conventional warfare (no nukes),  you'd have to hand it to the US, but this doesn't give any context.  What are they fighting over?  Neither could invade and occupy the other, so what are their aims?

cVVvHNXSaa	Yeah that's nice and all but personally I don't care who thinks what of me, lol!     Jk! capricorn sun here ;)    edit - Yes I agree that Capricorns has admirable traits and the problem is that we Capricorns are not that much appreciated when people don't understand us. That's when we are called 'boring' Unlike other signs we don't like praise, we don't need a clap or someone telling us things like "good job." We know when we do things to our best ability, we know we have conquered or accomplished.     For being a Capricorn woman I am gratefull I was born under this sign because some of the situations that I've come across I would say that I wouldn't know how to handle it any other way. So I would say yeah, being ambitious and hardworking and caring are admirable traits of a Capricorn woman.|`|Po6dgusAaa	of course it is. Cap women have good trait and bad traits. It really depends on the kind of person they are.Their environment and their social upbringing.|`|872fcc76954a83920779a9df510b118baa	yes is amirable i love capricorn women.  but hey i'm a capricorn moon person.  so ......what do you expect?  ha. no seriously.... i love Capys  :)|`|rmse6Mj8aa	both my parents are capricorns. they are very different.    i think that i have to say i struggle with capricorn women more than men. they tend to be extremely difficult people.    having said that, they are also wonderful. capricorn is such a complicated misunderstood sign. there is this stuffy personality that everyone expects from an earth sign but they are so sensitive and artistic underneath. they are also party animals deep down.kate moss and david bowie are both capricorns after all.    the thing i find hardest about capricorns is that they never apologise. they are always the victims in a scenario and can only see their own point of view.   if you can realise that they are nice people with good intentions and an incredible level of commitment to their goals, then you can let the flaws slide. they are wonderful in a crisis too and for pumping up your self esteem when you are feeling low.    they are demanding friends and family members: all or nothing. they phone 5 times a day every day or they don't call at all as everything is focused from their point of view for their needs and their convenience.    this is only my opinion but here is what they say on cafe astrology.com    i find the men much more fun!    http://cafeastrology.com/zodiaccapricorn...|`|fldXZ1BMaa	Yeah most of us are misunderstood i think. I think people also admire the fact that we are very loyal and are always there for the people we love and care about... without fail, we are great listeners and very honest. Most of the time we put others before ourselves.    We are very ambitious people ( I certainly am ) and i will do everything in my power to make my dreams a reality i work very hard to achieve my goals and yes it is admirable who wouldn't admire that in a person :)|`|mC91jDUKaa	What's on the surface usually tends to be driven by your rising sign.  Do you happen to know what your rising sign is?|`|3yp7TRUoaa	Capricorns are far from boring. It's often misunderstood. They're just hard to get to know, and if they don't say much it's because they wanna know about you and if you seem like a trustworthy, nice person and if you have any hidden intentions. People admire Capricorns because of their Loyalty. Their family-orientated ways, ambition, mystery, and humor. Most Capricorn women are known for their strong personality. Their ability to hide their feelings at the right times. They try not to lose their face. No matter how casual her dressing is, she still has a unique class to her.

zetxxZWUaa	I wouldn't expect you to understand any of it. Old scary movies like that wouldn't scare your generation because the only horror you guys know is pop-out scary. The Shining was psychologically scary. If you grew up around the old scary flicks like i did you would find the scaryness of the Shining.    Don't ask so many questions like where exactly Danny's imaginary friend and psychic ability fit in, he just has it, no explanation and it doesn't need one. The picture at the end indicated that Jack has been apart of that hotel the entire time and just didn't know it.    It's not that hard to understand, don't try and solve everything in the movie because it's pointless, if you read the book the questions your asking won't be answered because there is no explanation and that is what makes it truely horrifying.|`|y8WBcehmaa	okay that's a lot of questions, but I'm going to try to help.    Some people find it scary, it was a lot scarier when it came out in 1980 than it is today. You may just not like Stanley Kubrick's style.    Jack started to go crazy because of his lack of alcohol, he is an alcoholic. So really he started off a little crazy because he was off the stuff. But as time went on he grew more and more desperate for it. Which is why he imagined himself in the bar.    Danny's imaginary friend I believe is his way of coping with this gift. It's better for him to pretend that it is Tony telling him these things than realizing that they are his own intuitions.    Redrum fits in because that was Danny's way of warning his mother, it was part of his premonition, I believe. I think it was also meant to startle the audience especially with the way it was said in that creepy voice. It woudn't have been as scary if he had just been saying murder, then you'd know from the beginning.    The hotel was really haunted, I believe, Jack's insanity made him more susceptible to their plans which is why the others weren't possessed like him. As you recall Tony saw the ghosts too, the little girls haunted him.    The picture at the end was I believe meant to show that Jack was now one of the ghosts of the house, that he would remain their to haunt others for all eternity.    The lady in the bathtub was just another ghost in the house, I think she did attack danny and Jack kissed her because he saw her as hot even though the viewer could see she wasn't which he eventually realized    hope that helped. :) It's my favorite horror movie.|`|nmbbG0vdaa	lol|`|eysDi4rIaa	i suggest you watch the movie in a few years... it is not meant for your age group.|`|rSq790ksaa	This new generation (yours) has seen so many scary movies that you have become descencitized to old psychological horror movies.    If you watch the movie again you may be able to understand it better. The movie is not supposed to scare you, it's supposed to make you think and be a little disturbed.     Yes, the hotel was really supposed to be haunted. The whole book/movie is based off of a hotel the author stayed in Estes Park, Colorado called The Stanley Hotel. I've stayed there and it is very creepy there.

Yes, when I first heard the story, I thought: Someone's a few bees short of a hive! (End lame joke.)    So turns out, she made it all up. Although she did carve a "B" into her own cheek. And she can't explain why she did it. She was charged with filing a false police report and instead of being cited is being sent to seek mental help.    Okay, it doesn't take a detective to figure this one out...    She obviously wanted to make a claim that people were so crazy for Barack that they would go out and beat anyone who wouldn't support him. Of course it backfired, hence stupidity. There is nothng wrong with her mental stability, although I give her credit for figuring out how to carve a full "B" into her cheek...|`|b588ea9ae577d8516ac0cfb6e137875baa	A pig.

I don't want to tell you to change who you are by changing your style, etc, but I think your make-up is a bit much! I don't find it flattering at all, and the intense red lip? ... NO!

R7VjuCT2aa	Alot has to do with they way they were raised by parents. My mom always taught and showed me that in fact women and men are indeed equal in every sense.
3e3JSHT0aa	Ribery is the logical choice for Chelsea, seeing as how they missed out on Robson De Souza Dos Santos Leite. Ribery would be so good as he would scare away defenders with his looks.

"The weaker sex" is a complete myth perpetuated by both men and women. Physical strength has nothing to do with it. Loads of women are physically stronger and better at sport than men but most have the sense not to be too obvious about it. Let's face it when it suits them any woman can put on the "weaker sex" act and when they do they can twist the supposedly stronger sex around their little finger!    You're obviously young but I'm sure you'll learn.|`|14gi4aTvaa	My girlfriend is probably stronger than me. She's been doing taekwando ever since she was little.  I've only been doing it for like 3 years. I'm fine with it :P|`|E4iUcYEjaa	Old-time thinkers, stereotypes, and double standards still exist in our society, that is why.  Not all men are really sexists, even if most of them seem they are - it's all for show in front of their boys.  But trust, not all guys are like that!    Men have to live up to "standards" and stereotypes placed by family and peers to be "strong" therefore making them masculine.   But honestly a real man will respect a women and appreciate her for what she's really worth (especially in this day and age after the women's movement) - not some slave working at home cooking and taking care of their children.    These "real" men are harder to find, but again, they're out there.

Don't get me wrong, I think any individual is capable of anything regardless of sex but I think you have misunderstood what is meant by "the weaker sex", if you added the power of every man in the world together, then added the power of women together, then got the 2 powers to arm wrestle, men would win, and by a lot. Now, when it comes to brain power, multi tasking, emotional development etc etc then women have got men licked and we don't even try and argue with it, so why try and steal our thing?|`|H46ZABMtaa	Maybe physically, but mentally they are weaker than us.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	One word you infantile prat: Childbirth, that's why we're the stronger sex.

r8s5j6zOaa	it's not 1900|`|AA11097657	Didn't know it was.    I make my boyfriend carry my shoulder bag on holiday.    Strange thing is, he doesn't seem to mind!|`|9f8XoDKJaa	Its not.    Its just people are forced to except people that do.|`|tTksfeufaa	because you are in the gay quarter?    as far as i know only gay men carry handbags!|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Laptops. they are cumbersome without a bag to put it in.|`|6fbce3ff42dd216a83c3e009ccebb0eeaa	Coz duffel bags are so uncool....|`|ta1ALj4qaa	Its really not cool!!!

Especially if you live in Seattle, like I do.  I think my boyfriend generally keeps an umbrella, his rain coat and a water bottle in his bag... not to mention the laptop/books/papers he needs to carry to and from work.    It is very easy and convenient and looks more stylish, professional than a backpack, but is easier to carry than a traditional briefcase.|`|Ic6Fyszgaa	It is?!  Guys carry murses?

DMpVSHvXaa	I see plenty of them in the music that I play. They aren't as prevalent as 16th and 8th notes, but they're very much there.    Now, 256th, 512th and 1024th notes, those you don't see very often.    (I think the shortest duration I've played was a 128th note (semihemidemisemiquaver), IIRC; it was in the slow movement of a concerto that I learned.)|`|JdqDauEDaa	It depends what level music you are playing. It's very common when you are on the college level. I've had several clarinet solos with 32nd notes. The Rose book for clarinet has several etudes which use them as well.     I would say to rate band music in terms of technical difficulty, grade 5 and 6 music will contain more complex meters and rhythms than a grade 1-4 piece. The ranking goes something like this   1/2-beginner band  1-easy  2-easy  3-medium easy  4-medium/medium difficult  5-medium difficult  6-advanced|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	Not particularly true, no. While in most music you won't find as many 32nd (demisemiquaver in Brit) rests as perhaps quarter and eighth notes, they are by no means that rare either. One can even have 64th and 128th notes and rests.|`|1f07IVRvaa	32nd notes are only somewhat uncommon. Obviously not as common as 16ths, but I would definitely not say they are "not very often used." I would reserve that distinction for 64th notes, which are indeed pretty rare.    One common case would be when there is simply a very fast run to be played. Here's an example from Mozart's Jupiter Symphony: http://imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/b/... (Scroll down to PDF page 3, which is page 2 in the ink)  Here's another famous example, from Bach's Toccata and Fugue in d minor (bonus: 64th notes, too!): http://www.free-scores.com/PDF/bach-joha...    Another common instance in which you would see 32nd notes is in a string of notes within a slow piece or movement in which the eighth note gets the beat. Here's an example of this usage from the 2nd movement of the Jupiter Symphony: http://imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/b/... (Scroll down to PDF page 67, which is page 66 in the ink)|`|tuATxHsVaa	Like the person above me said, you see them all the time in slower movements (see Beethoven, Mozart, and Haydn piano sonatas, for instance).    Of course, you can find them in lots of concertos all throughout the works.    You could indeed make an argument that they are less often used than 16ths, 8ths, quarters, etc.    The breve, or double whole note, is a lot more uncommon.   As are 128th notes, etc. 32nd notes are quite common in comparison.    One of my teachers used to have a hilarious piece of music with all kinds of stuff on the page that you rarely see. It was quite a joke to hand it to musicians and ask them to play it.    Interesting question =).|`|kbFty6eVaa	The 2nd mvt of Beethoven's 3rd piano concerto has 256th notes at one point, and sextuplet 128th notes. You see these smaller values when the tempo is slow or extremely slow. 32nd note rest is not as common as a run of 32nd notes but it's not the rarest thing in the would. Generally I would say that 32nd notes are not particularly uncommon.    You can see 32nd notes in a piece of generally fast tempo, but you probably won't see 32nd note rests at the same tempo|`|tOeWGeYKaa	Well, they're not very commonly used in most music. They do appear, however.

2Ui2Uezfaa	Before anything else, think about it. How many times in your life would this chance probably come swinging by?   If you want it, go grab it! Grab the opportunity! You won't have anything to lose!   If you don't, you might regret it in the future. You didn't follow your dream, why? because of acne? Don't let acne defeat you and stop you from trying to reach your dream!  A million of people probably dream of getting the chance you already have. Go grab it girl!  If it doesn't turn out the way you want it to, then all the more reason to keep on trying! Although I'm sure it pretty much will because you're beautiful! Be confident honey, you're beautiful!    I really hope this helps :)|`|re06t6zvaa	well your pictures are really pretty, and i think that if modeling is something you've been dreaming about your whole life, then you should totally go for it! don't let acne or whatever slow you down. it doesn't rule your life. and acne isn't permanent, so i say go down there and give it your best shot! :)|`|gm3SlwTcaa	wowowowo you are beautiful    tell them that you have always wanted tomodelsince you were alittle baby and be confident    and if they ask about the acne ask if you could go in for some before shots and after for like pro active or something similar    xoxo|`|AA11634270	Why not just try.

wu9nPCGhaa	Stanley is initially upset because Stella let Blanche stay with them. She's an intrusion in Stanley's eyes.     Stanley is an abusive and mean guy. He likes power and control. We don't know his past so we don't know what lead him to behave that way, but if you recall it's not just Blanche he's like that towards, Stella too. But, Stella is attracted to that rough side of him though and that's why she stays with him. Wheras Blanche is horrified by Stanley's behavior.    Stanley is used to having things his way and Blanche upsets the system that him and Stella have going by intruding with her reprimands and clothes and southern ramblings. It drives Stanley mad and of course at the end he succeeds in driving Blanche mad (literally) in turn.    A little fact, at the end of the movie Stella says she's going to leave Stanley, but at the end of the original play she goes back to him. That just shows you what kind of person Blanche is and how much power Stanley has over her.    Hope I helped you. ^_^

hDSENEUyaa	It is phone booth, and it is a so-so film.|`|gzaVGE4Qaa	Phone Booth|`|lWMwkhe4aa	I think your talking about Phone booth.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_Booth...|`|3i5pV24Raa	Phone Booth for sure    A slick New York publicist who picks up a ringing receiver in a phone booth is told that if he hangs up, he'll be killed... and the little red light from a laser rifle sight is proof that the caller isn't kidding. Written by Ryan McIntosh {Ryanmcintosh01@hotmail.com}     Stu Shepard is a fast talking and wise cracking New York City publicist who gets out of trouble and lies with his clever charm, connections, and charisma. Stu's greatest lie is to his wife Kelly, who he is cheating on with his girlfriend, Pam. Upon answering a call in a phone booth in belief it is Pam, Stu is on the line with a dangerous yet intelligent psychopath with a sniper rifle. When realizing it is not a joke, Stu is placed in a powerful mind game of wits and corruption. The New York City Police eventually arrive thereafter and demand Stu comes out of the phone booth- but how can he when if he hangs up or leaves the booth he will die? Written by commanderblue     Stu Shepard (Farrell) is an arrogant publicist who thinks he has the whole world in his hands. Every day he uses the same phone booth to call the woman (Holmes) he is cheating on his wife (Mitchell) with. But on the last day, before this particular phone booth is demolished, the phone rings. Stu naturally answers the phone, only to find the caller (Sutherland) on the end is an invisible sniper who knows everything on Stu, including his relationships. The caller now has Stu as his hostage, who demands he comes clean with his wife. Written by FilmFanUK     Stuart hasn't been totally honest. In fact, he's about the most dishonest man you'll meet. Everyday, at the same time, he goes to a phone booth in NYC to call his girlfriend, so that his wife can't trace the phone call. Today is no longer just an ordinary day. Now, someone's calling him, leaving his life on the line. Written by Mac The Movieguy     A fiendish publicist finds himself being held hostage in a phone booth by an extreme moralist who watches his victim's every move through the scope of his high-power sniper rifle, while speaking to the publicist via the phone booth. The caller prides himself on using force to punish corrupt people by forcing them to admit all of their lies and sins through mental games, or killing them. At the same time, he eliminates other people as well; everyday people who are guilty of brutal dishonesty and/or corruption, such as a murderous street pimp and a pushy pizza man (all of which, if you look hard enough in the film, have a guilt link). The caller himself is corrupt, and uses it defeat other corruption. It is evil fighting evil in the phone booth|`|dwwCJHpQaa	phone booth
4bFypdGLaa	There's the movie. And this year they're making another series called full metal alchemist.. I don't think it'll be a continuation though. I think this time their gonna do the series after the Manga.  But the Anime withe the 51 episodes and the movie had a completely different plot than the manga....... in the manga the other side of the gate isn't even mentioned so- the odds are that the next season won't be anything like the episodes you just watched    But the movie ends the series U just watched. I own and recommend it. =_=     And Full metal Panic is a completely different series, not about the same thing nor the same character made by a different company and Mangaka...... If U like Mecha you should check it out, but U won't find the Elrics or Alchemy in that series.    Hope I helped.|`|WS1rqp0Gaa	Full metal alchemist and Full metal panic are two totally diffrent animes.  There are no further episodes after 51 but there is 1 movie and 5 OVAs.    The movie is title"Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa"(Gekijban "Hagane no Renkinjutsushi: Shanbara o Yuku Mono")  -The movie's story is set two years after the events of the TV series' last episode. Edward Elric now lives in Munich, Germany, in the year 1921. Stripped of his alchemical powers, he has been researching rocketry all this time together with Alphonse Heiderich, a young man who resembles his own brother.   In this world parallel to his, Edward encounters some people besides Alfons whose faces are familiar to him. After lending a hand to a troubled gypsy girl, Edward is thrown in a series of events that can open him a path to return to his homeworld, where Alphonse Elric ventures deeper into the mysteries of alchemy in search of a way to reunite with his older brother, but that also can have serious consequences.    For the 5 OVAs:  1."Chibi Party"   -A party riot is in view, where all of the characters from both the theatrical release and the series are turned into chibi forms. Envy's dragon form is actually a costume. After removing the costume, many characters confuse his androgynous form with that of a female. Hawkeye begins with the denouncement of Mustang. Two suits of armor go next and reveal they are Scar and Lust. Scar rips off his X-shaped scar and propells it across the room at Ed and Al, but misses and strikes Gluttony. Ed meets Heidrich, and Al changes his voice to Heidrich's to insult Edward. Ed and Al then deal with a drunk Winry.     2."Kids"   -This brief sequence shows three children, who bear exact resemblances to the Elric brothers and to Winry Rockbell, making a trip through a modern city. They travel alone to Edward's apartment. Edward is by then aged and also referred to as a grandfather. In the end, a text scrolls along the bottom-center that reads, "In the year 2005, Edward Elric will be 100 years old. In this world, somewhere..."     3."Liveaction"  -Alphonse Elric, in his armor form, embarks on a quest in a real-life Japan to find his brother Edward. His search eventually takes him to Studio Bones, where the series was produced, but due to his size he cannot fit through the door.     4."Alchemists vs. Homunculi"   -The Fuhrer welcomes the viewer to the military and introduces himself. It laters shows a scene when the Fuhrer, Pride, is addressing Sloth, Wrath, Gluttony, and Lust. He commands them to destroy Greed, the Elrics and Mustang's group. Mustang has a meeting with his subordinates informing them they are dealing with the Homunculi and will venture into the unknown to rescue Ed and Al from Greed. After the rescue Ed and Al approach the viewer and congratulate them for their part in the work and depart.    5."Reflections"   -A recap of the series, with sections narrated by the Elric brothers, Roy Mustang, Maes Hughes, Greed and Envy.     You can watch the movie and the OVAs here:  http://www.instantz.net    Try reading the manga,too.The manga and tha anime are diffrent.Read here:  http://www.onemanga.com    ENJOY!!!|`|TQYof9Whaa	thers a movie

AA10075420	Thrice.  Check out their albums Vheissu or The Alchemy Index.  Very soothing, very aggressive, very emotional and thought provoking lyrics.  This is if you enjoy this kind of music.  It's sort of like a post-rock/experimental group.    Or check out some Jazz Fusion stuff.  Miles Davis, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Pat Metheny.  Great stuff that'll help you chill.    Or what I like to do before bed sometimes.  Go iTunes radio and listen to Stillstream in their ambient station, or Whisperings which is in the classical stations.  Try em, see what happens.|`|z4UGwO7taa	Cafe Del Mar...& Chillout music... cuz I do the same thin u do..!!!

1bkiNiwzaa	Cancer men are more homebodies than Leo. He may appear distant/secretive because  1) maybe he has some other influence in his natal chart  or  2) Cancerians cannot trust a person very easily because they are very insecure and sensitive and get hurt very easily. They need to feel that a person is worthy of/can be trusted with their secrets.    Cancerians need constant reassurances that they are as good as anybody else.They place very high priority on 1)family and 2) money  They are very emotional.Can be headstrong and very stubborn also.    Leos on the other hand are the kinds who love to be the center of attraction, they love to be famous, etc. They are not so emotional as Cancerians. They are usually quite social people.Stronger than Cancerians emotionally.    Depends on what you are looking for.|`|9lHduEWUaa	You'll have a much deeper relationship with the cancer.|`|77ZVd5hyaa	Both are great signs. I say keep them both around and enjoy the time spent with them. They both have very different things to offer.

I work in a movie theatre and I watched that movie whenever I got a chance. I must have watched it at least 5 or 6 times. I kinda' didn't like it the first time, but after I watched it again, and again, it just grew on me and I realized how well made the movie really is. I think you should give Bond another chance and you'll be surprised how much you'll enjoy it. Maybe you had a bad seat in the theatre or something. Other than not having as money jokes/laughs as other Bond movies this one was all serious and all business. Maybe a little to serious, but most audience agree that Craig is a terrific Bond.     As for as my disappointment: it would have to be the remake of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. I had enjoyed the original 1951 movie very much and I was looking for some great action from Keanu and Conolly. But the movie was extremely boring and dumb. I don't know why they would make a remake that is WORSE than the original. I don't think they should be allowed to do that ever again.|`|tLI94qWNaa	I had such high hopes for the movie Underworld evolution.

Caracter de Tauro  Los individuos que nacen durante este perodo son posesivos, siempre a la bsqueda de seguridad y goce de las alegras de la vida. Venus, regente del signo, empuja a buscar el placer y la satisfaccin de los deseos materiales. Tauro corresponde a la segunda casa del Zodiaco, que representa el momento en el que el recin nacido tiende a satisfacer su propia oralidad. Ve la posesin de los bienes como indispensable para conquistar la seguridad material, que pueda asegurarle a l y a los suyos la supervivencia, protegindole de todo riesgo. La tenacidad, la ponderacin y la perseverancia le hacen llegar casi siempre a sus metas prefijadas. A menudo es un trabajador metdico y fiel, dotado de una gran resistencia tanto fsica como psquica, lo que le convierte en un ser muv equilibrado ante los obstculos y las dificultades. Amante de la buena mesa, del ocio y de la comodidad. Es, tambin, un instintivo, un ser sano, en contacto directo con la naturaleza universal. Sus instintos son imperiosos, sensiualidad desbordante, bien instalada en lo real por un capital de salud que puede embrutecerlo en un egosmo confortable. Estos instintos son, sobre todo, captadores: captan, absorben, como races en la tierra. Este tipo es, pues, sobre todo, un instintivo oral, lleno de deseos digestivos, inclinado a engordar, a tragar, a asimilar, a adquirir, a poseer, a conservas, a vivir lo ms intensamente posible en el mundo del poseer. La exaltacin de la vida es vivida a la manera sensorial, haciendo de l un dionisaco: encantamientos terrestres, grandes voluptuosidades, amor por la tierra, la Naturaleza... y sus gustos son siempre sanos y sencillos. Sensual, posesivo en las relaciones afectivas, Tauro tiende tambin a considerar a su pareja como un objeto de su propiedad: de aqu los fuertes celos que pueden empujarlo a veces a verdaderos actos de clera violenta. Respetuoso con las tradiciones, es un conservador, a menudo un moralista, e intenta alcanzar un puesto en la vida respetando las convenciones y reglas sociales. Su amor por el hogar le empuja a invertir su dinero en bienes inmuebles, que le hacen sentirse seguro e inmune a los riesgos tan detestados por l.        Horoscopo 2009 Tauro  Este a?o 2009 ser un a?o de grandes cambios, donde se derribarn aquellas estructuras de pensamiento que no le permitan abrirse, tanto en el campo afectivo como en el laboral. Estas transformaciones permitirn el desapego de lo seguro y la oportunidad de aceptar cosas nuevas. Los taurinos debern vivir a la par de experiencias fuertes, habr viajes, rupturas o replanteamientos en las relaciones de amor, tambin pueden presentarse prdidas materiales y afectivas. A pesar de ello, el a?o ser bastante positivo, ya que todas estas experiencias le permitirn adquirir nuevas formas de vivir y lograrn encontrar la seguridad en s mismos. En este proceso de cambio, conocern nuevas personas, con otras culturas y conocimientos, de las que aprendern mucho y las que les cambiarn la vida.

She is sometimes very bossy and has to everything her way and she is lazy! she asks me to get her a cup of water all the time! Im sure not all taurus are like this...|`|Ru3Y8Mhdaa	Well I'm a Taurus we are mellow, love to eat, love to have nice things, very sensitive, caring, stubborn, we fight for the things we love, we are all about following a routine, we love things that are familiar to us, and we definitely love nice people.

And aren't women pretty much that way about the men they love?  Wife or lover, or husband or lover, we want to see the goods and touch and enjoy them.    The difference is that the stripper and playmate are both women who put their goods on display for a price, to be seen and enjoyed by men of all stripes and persuasions.  They may be men who can't connect on their own or men who have connected and want more.

On the 7th of the 3rd and 4th string, hold that. and on the 5th of the 5th string.  and repeat above.|`|ty3nnq2uaa	Firstly its better to tinker about with guitar playing any screeching wailing noises till you get comfy with it    speaking of the tabs like  e-------------------------------------...  b-------------------------------------...  g--------0-------------------------0--...  d-----4----4-----4----4-------4----4--...  a--2----------2----5--------0---------...  E-------------------------------------...    the bottommost is the 6th string(the thickest one)  and the topmost the 1st string  each dotted line represents a string in order    in this tab first seeing from left comes a-2 that means play second fret of a string and so on in order from left side    the dashes represent time gap  more the dashes between two notes more is the time gap between two notes    later other things like pulloffs and bends are also symbolised using p and b and \ /for slides etc    your tab has a-5,d-7,g-7 ie play all three together in one stroke  do not play any other string  it would be easier to use a bar chord for playing this      hope it helped!!!!!!!!!!  by the way this one is fade to black intro|`|MRwb4jQYaa	First it'd probably be a good idea to get familiar with your guitar.  Then it'd be best to find a physical human being who could show you how to read tab.  No one on here could explain it as easily.|`|riU8KC4daa	Each line corresponds to a string, so  E ------------------------------- (thinest string)  B -------------------------------  G -7-7-7--7-7-7--7-7-7----  D -7-7-7--7-7-7--7-7-7-----  A -5-5-5--5-5-5--5-5-5-----  E -------------------------------- (thickest string)    And the numbers mean which fret to the play the string on, if you had only one number, you would play that one not, when  you have more like G7, D7, and A5 in a line like above, you play them at the same time|`|2a4mNOxmaa	Each line on the guitar tab corresponds to a string on the guitar.    The strings in order from bottom to top are: E, A, D, G, B, E.    Low E being the thickest, high E being the thinnest.    The numbers on a guitar tab correspond to what fret is to be played on the guitar, so for example: if a seven was to be placed on the bottom line, it would mean that you would be pressing down the seventh fret on the bottom string.    The first fret on the guitar is a semitone above the string it is played on. And every fret above that is one semitone above the fret before, for example: a fifth fret note played on the A string, would be a E, seeing seven notes above A is E.

When he caught up with his friend, and told him what happened, he said:     "What a coincidence, I too sent my son to the holy land to become a better jew, yet he came back a christian." They both agreed to consult their local rabbi.    "We both sent our sons to the holy land to become better jews, yet they came back Christians. Why did this happen?"    The rabbi said:    "What a coincidence, I too sent my son to the holy land to become a better jew, yet he came back a christian. Perhaps we should talk to God about this."

He orders the guy out of bed and ties him to a chair, while tying the girl to the bed he gets on top of her, kisses her neck, then gets up and goes into the bathroom. While he's in there, the husband tells his wife:    "Listen, this guy's an escaped convict, look at his clothes! He probably spent lots of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in years. I saw how he kissed your neck." If he wants sex, don't resist, don't complain, do whatever he tells you. Satisfy him no matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is probably very dangerous. If he gets angry, he'll kill us. Be strong, honey. I love you."    To which his wife responds: "He wasn't kissing my neck. He was whispering in my ear.

IT really worked . to remove the oil rub neat shampoo all over the hair rince then repeat then remove the dead ones with a lice comb xx good luck .|`|04Tk1zc0aa	I dont think you can prevent them returning unless you stop washing thier hair. Tea tree in thier shampoo may help though as it kills them and the eggs.|`|AA11537389	No, never.  I think I would really freak out if they did!|`|n05GDUcUaa	Mine get them sometimes, i normally use hedrin and i comb their hair with a nit comb at least twice a week even if i don't think they have any, it is easier to prevent them than get rid of them.You could try also using a shampoo and conditioner with tea tree :)|`|4V8xMMBlaa	I always used teatree oil shampoo on my son's hair and he never got lice once. There is a new product on the market called Lyclear you could try that but really you have to get the old nit comb out and get rid of them with that.|`|ECalPlzlaa	Tea tree shampoo and conditioner is great for avoiding lice and baby oil is great for getting them out cos they cant hold on to the hair so you can comb them out easily my daughter only had them once they are disgusting little things.|`|FbY7506uaa	The way I do it is I put tea tree oil on their head andd then  I add some shampoo in it. I put a shower cap over it and leave it for about 10 minutes. Then rinse it out. Some lice fall out while you are rinsing it. Then grab a lice comb and go through the head and you should get some lice out especially little lice. It should kill the lice and stop the eggs from hatching. Thenjustt rinse  your hair normally with shampoo.    But the tea tree oil smell lasts for a few days so keep on washing your hair with shampoo. Or if youdon'tt want people to know just spray the hair with some spray so it is harder to smell the tea tree oil.    Hope this info is helpful.|`|lnUrm4sGaa	the best way to treat the littlebeggarss is buy a cheap bottle of hair conditioner and a lice comb and do the combing method which is covering the hair in conditioner and combing through till their gone but you will have to do this for a bout a week because of the eggs that will still be in their thathaven'tt hatched their horrible i know but easy to get rid of though so don't worry

0IKwusdgaa	Yes they do because if they like you, they want you to make the first move and telling you by giving you a hint. They like slowly going to a person, like Taurus. I cant tell you that he likes you, but if you feel a vibe :P then he probably does. Caps are cautious not shy. They have the guts to ask you out, however not the guts to feel rejected. As you might know they take calculated risks with what may happen if....and they think alot before doing something. He migh also be reserved so hinting could be the safest for him. They also love to test people to see if your the one. Not all caps are like this though. Most are like for example me.|`|77ZVd5hyaa	Just stop over thinking this and enjoy yourself.|`|Pew3CdCjaa	this is cap lady... we usually drop the hint always...  if we don't care, you might surprise how we act that we really don't care|`|3WItFAwlaa	Just go.

pK5B2bROaa	There`s a guy named Brother Ali, I`m not sure how long he`s been around, but he has a song called Whatcha Got that was featured in Madden 08. There`s K`naan who just re-emerged, but it`s more of a `poor man struggle` rap. To prove a point, the first song I heard from him was called Strugglin`. Also, theres a guy named Ashton Bishop. Goes by `The Kid Famous`, or just Famous. Got a song called Ain`t No Use, which is him basically pointing out some of the things rappers do these days; certain movements and gestures, and saying `It ain`t necessary to do this **** to get played. Be yourself``. Can`t explain it any better as I`m buzzin`, but it`s really a good song.|`|2S6iXcmCaa	the new rappers suck   the new rap its not called hip hop its called hip pop   cuz all their doing is bringing their little dance moves in it|`|P93I8CHtaa	ron browz    he's featured on pop champagne and arab money,he even made his own song    its called jumping out the window|`|6S84UQcvaa	d.masta  http://depositfiles.com/files/vgnw58qv4  http://depositfiles.com/files/a65xybc3e  http://depositfiles.com/files/kcjxn44an

z7JsVzcnaa	Independent labels sign bands that the major labels won't, allowing these bands or groups to produce and release music that otherwise wouldn't be.  They also don't demand the level of control over albums that the major labels would.|`|vmx1VZnTaa	Being indepent keep the money floating,instead of steady giving money to big labels like jive and sony|`|SkRJNhuCaa	They don't have the massive pressure to produce only things that fit a certain formula that turned out to sell well for the last few months, which stifles creativity in the big labels.    They also are happy with smaller runs, thus enabling local and regionally known artists to record rather than just the few that have already made it internationally.  Without that, those artists would never gain the exposure needed to make it internationally (and thus get noticed by the big boys).    And they provide healthy competition for the big labels, which is always good.|`|hJP9y6kjaa	Signing a band involves money - a big label is going to want to invest in bands that they feel are more likely to appeal to the biggest audiences. Smaller independent labels can cater to genres and subgenres, and court and sign bands that may fly under the radar of the bigger corporate structures.    They have less money, but also much less overhead and less to lose, so they can risk more on relatively unknown quantities.    It's like Microsoft vs small software companies... Microsoft has the capital and muscle to distribute a product, but not necessarily the agility to pursue R&D and go after new ideas - the whole risk thing - that smaller companies can go for. The entrepreneurial spirit in the form of the smaller companies can then be gobbled up by the soul-less corporate conglomerate, and everyone wins. Well, something like that. =)        Saul|`|1e3e79f5d2afacec16e368695a7510d5aa	They allow for upcoming artists to get known to a wider spread of people but with A LOT less restrictions :)

ef831d986a5932fbeb4aaba747db2c77aa	Plasma is definitely the best. LCD flat screens are cheaper, but they have the memory effect that makes the picture pixilatate on fast moving detailed images, and a less than perfect signal aggrevates this.  DLP, don't even think about it. OLED sounds promising.

It's one of those shows that just sucks you in, and when the season ends - you go through a phase of depression! I don't think there's a single other show out there that makes you think so much.

xumwwW8faa	there is nothing wrong with being proud of your heritage/background and family.....    but seeing as the nazi war is still a very touchy and emotional subject for alot of people, its probably not wise to "boast" as you can easily offend and be taken out of context.|`|CdTe8MO4aa	write a book about it..  dont brag about it|`|baQpo0kdaa	y boast about it? its wrong since your bragging and proud about something so awful. so yes u r hated now troll|`|gDEFlWnOaa	It's definately not something to be proud of.|`|nRGELSqVaa	Of course you're not hates..what your ancestors did is nothing to do with you.

I saw the film before the books and I'll be honest the film hasn't really stuck with me but the books have.  I really need to see that film again I think.|`|9F3GOelfaa	I saw it before I read the books and thought it was amazing.. then I read the books.  The movie is still great in my opinion but it is nothing compared to the books.|`|JKs0lkRgaa	i dont like it. the climax is not so good|`|IaSNz4EJaa	no,,!! I hate that kind of film and story!! corny!!|`|pLQxHFo3aa	no, bcoz i go to the cinema to enjoy myself and the movie not be bored to death by a bunch emo wanna be "vampires"|`|LDgS0FwCaa	im not going to say that I LOVE IT but because i saw the movie before i read  the books i think its pretty good.  it was a low budget movie and you can see that.. but i think the one downturn to the movie was that it was somehow all dull.. i dont know if you know what i mean but it had the same colourtones throughout the whole movie..green..grey and black and stuff also i think that kristin stewart for some reason blinked too much when she was talking and just seemed really uptight anyways thats my views but i still liked it.. cant wait until new moon comes out chris weitz is a fantasy director so it has to be much better and we get to see jacob and the volturi it comes out in november this year YES!!|`|iJ3BeFWxaa	YES !!

He's a good rhymer, but half his songs are corny and can't be taken seriously. He's good but he's no legend.|`|HDyqzvUkaa	No, I liked Eminem alot but he is no Legend.    he doesn't have a message that's moving people in unison, he's just a good rhymer|`|TK4Tj9FPaa	His story of how he overcame the obstacles in his life is inspirational and he's made some good songs but I wouldn't call him a legend.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Yes! Because he is a white rapper!|`|Likst1Mxaa	A bit demanding, aren't we??    I think Eminem is a b!oody legend because he's a successful white rapper in an industry which is dominated by black culture. I don't think it is a specific album with makes him a legend (only people like MJ's 'Thriller' can say that), just his essence.|`|wUkU3HVwaa	no he isn't|`|ZUcQAqRUaa	Yeah, he's brilliant!

He still has the record of the best selling rap album in a week he sold 1.32 million copies of The Eminem Show. I dont think that will be topped anytime soon.

hKy1blrqaa	LoL we all have different taste in music and thats perfectly fine.  Personally, Mariah Carey is my favorite artist of allll time. I've got dvd's of her live performances, shes amazing. But thats not something anyone can really prove to you. Its all about what her voice sounds like to you. Look up her videos where she sings live on youtube, maybe that helps ya! :]]|`|LIyqb5Rwaa	Because she has a 5 octave vocal range.    But I do believe, she has sent an entire generation of wanna-be and would-be singers down a path of excessive vocal modulation.    No one can just sing a nice, long, steady, notes any more.  It has to warble and go up and down in pitch and go through every other vocal acrobatic exercise.    Its painful sometimes.|`|2XTkSV4daa	because my voice stinks, everyone else sounds good.|`|Ysq3N0UCaa	Back in the day she was AMAZING  Now after all them high notes her voice is cracking up.

It's in the emotions, the tone, etc.|`|4g9UKpyVaa	because she can do the "whistle" it's a very high note.  not a lot of people can do that.    i dont like her generally but i dont hate her too.

VijJYZznaa	Metallica is probably the best example of a sell out. I'm fine with a band wanting to change course and write whatever they want, but they went from writing "..And Justice For All", their most technical album, to "The Black Album". They were touring "And Justice" around 1988-89 and suddenly began to write incredibly simple radio-rock songs in 1990-91. It wasn't a gradual musical progression, it was a cynical attempt to be popular and make money.|`|Xi5eJGKGaa	Pretty much...I mean, they even sued their very own fans.|`|ty3nnq2uaa	i think one guy has totally lost his marbles and nuts as well  cannibal corpse took 15 years to reach 1million sales according to wiki  tons of band sell multi million albums    beatles and elvis have sold more than 1billion  ACDC ,led zep,pink floyd,iron maiden,guns n roses are high sellers  metallica is that way low but highest thrash metal for sure  (that is a debated genre sometimes but i believe it)    surprisingly backstreet boys probably has the highest sales to years ratio    all top listers are generally old timers    Disturbed is probably the highest selling near to post 2000 band  breaking benjamin,killswitch engage also sells|`|soFpywFcaa	no|`|s5Oa83sYaa	yeh thats why i dont listen to em. there are other sellouts like ac dc|`|6fc53371b01ec327c2560b7b47e86977aa	I have been scarred by the "Some Kind of Monster" movie.

sYqSMmWoaa	I'm gonna go out on a limb and agree with you partially.... I thought the Dark Knight would at least get a nod, its not JUST a super hero movie with no depth and its not just good because of Heath Ledger. But Slumdog is a worthy candidate for a nom, and it will likely win. It was the kind of feel good story people are drawn to in tough times like this. I was more surprised the Reader got a nom. i saw it as just another holocaust movie getting recognition, like life is beautiful. but whatever.. the oscars are all politics, and movie snobs will never embrace a "superhero movie"|`|uurgL3oZaa	I'm with you 100%. It should have gotten nominated instead of Forrest Gump 2...errr, I mean Benjamin Button....|`|niVtwCCVaa	why are you surprised exactly? The Dark Knight was absolute crap!|`|OV66q85iaa	You are entitled to your opinion but Dark Knight was good because Heath Ledger made it good. All in all, Dark Knight doesn't have substance. It's a comic story for crying out loud.    Slumdog Millionaire may be an average movie to you (are you like 15?) of course but that movie has substance, all are great actors and the story is good.|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	The dark Knight was NOT a great film. Ledger's Joker couldn't touch Nicholson's.|`|VoFFpD49aa	Because after everything....all the money it made, the performance by Heath Ledger, the plot twists, the praise from fans and critics...it's a "comic book" film, and those type of films don't get nominated much less win. But I agree w/ you, at the very least it should have received a nomination.|`|UMNJJdsAaa	The Dark Knight was good because of Heath Ledger. The movie itself was not all that good. Slumdog Millionaire had a great ensemble cast, the movie was above and beyond average.|`|IEliUISJaa	really,the dark knight should be best pichter, only because of (probple did not spell this right) keth leger A.K.A The Joker|`|etxSRf3Raa	Dark Knight was not all that great, I'm sorry to say. It was wayyy to long and the only thing that made DK stand out was Heath Ledgers performance ( and my opinion the narrative of the ending). Other than that Dark Knight wouldn't have made as much money and would be just as ordinary without Heath Ledger.    I however though Slumdog was great! I'm only surprised that the Oscars snubbed Doubt and Gran Torino, which was both amazing.

And the story is something like that a group of people went on searching for their nests( the bugs) to already stop the disaster.    During the adventure, many of the group members died leaving a male and a female who only survived and went successful    The ending would be, thinking everything was at peace already, they make love in a bed wherein they don't know that there's still left, a giant bug!

VhTppECFaa	PURETONE - Addicted To Bass    Listen here:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0teP99JFw...|`|zRmwEFAwaa	Happiness is a Warm Gun from The Beatles is a good example, it changes beat.. As said here in Wiki.    One of the most salient musical features of the song is its frequent shifts in meter. Beginning in 2/4 time, the song shifts to 3/4 time on "which he gave and donated to the national trust" and to 6/8 time for the guitar solo in the "I need a fix..." section. This gives way to 6/8, 3/4, and 4/4 measures in the "Mother Superior..." section before returning to 4/4 for the majority of the doo-wop style ending. During Lennon's spoken-word interlude, the song briefly switches into 6/4. The spoken word section has its roots in the song later on the album "I'm So Tired" because, exhibited in the song's home demo, is a spoken word section in 6/4 time that is almost exactly like the one in "Happiness is a Warm Gun".

05kAf2DZaa	You are all what I was begging for  What my empty soul  wanted to feel  You are all what I was waiting for  What I was searching in dreams  And I have found in you.    You have come to awake  Each part of my soul  Each part of me  Already I have no heart  Nor eyes for no one  Only for you    You are the love of my live  The destiny already knew  And today you were presented in the light of me.  And each time I look at the past  I understand that on your side  I always belonged    You have come to awake  Each part of my soul  Each part of me  Already I have no heart  Nor eyes for no one  Only for you(x3)    This is really  What I feel  I know my place  Is together with you    You are all what I was begging for  What I didnt know  And I have found in you.

AA10374849	Must be Grace by Jeff Buckley (he had a lot of versions... one of them being acoustic)    There's the moon asking to stay  Long enough for the clouds to fly me away  Well it's my time coming, i'm not afraid, afraid to die    My fading voice sings of love  But she cries to the clicking of time,    WAIT IN THE FIRE...    And she weeps on my arm  Walking to the bright lights in sorrow  Oh drink a bit of wine we both might go tomorrow  Oh my love...    And the rain is falling and i believe my time has come  And it reminds me of the pain i might leave behind    WAIT IN THE FIRE...    And i feel them drown my name  So easy to know and forget with this kiss  But i'm not afraid to go, baby it's all because of you  But i'm not afraid to go, but it goes so slow, slow  WAIT IN THE FIRE...WAIT IN THE FIRE...WAIT IN THE FIRE...    ...don't you take it away from me|`|s3gBSCcQaa	Possibly "Through the Fire" by Chaka Khan......?    I look in your eyes and I can see  Weve loved so dangerously  Youre not trusting your heart to anyone  You tell me youre gonna play it smart  Were through before we start  But I believe that weve only just begun    When its this good, theres no saying no  I want you so, Im ready to go    Chorus:  Through the fire  To the limit, to the wall  For a chance to be with you  Id gladly risk it all  Through the fire  Through whatever, come what may  For a chance at loving you  Id take it all the way  Right down to the wire  Even through the fire    I know youre afraid of what you feel  You still need time to heal  And I can help if youll only let me try  You touch me and something in me knew  What I could have with you  Well Im not ready to kiss that dream goodbye    When its this sweet, theres no saying no  I need you so, Im ready to go    Chorus    Through the test of time    Chorus    Through the fire, to the limit  Through the fire, through whatever  Through the fire, to the limit  Through the fire, through whatever

3i5pV24Raa	If it was between 2001 and 2005 there is a movie called "Bee Season" (2005)    11-year-old Eliza Naumann comes from an odd family; they all divert their emotional frustrations into secret channels. When Eliza unexpectedly begins winning spelling bees, what had been a stable dynamic within the family becomes disrupted; long held secrets emerge, and a latent spiritual yearning is awakened in her withdrawn father Saul and compulsive mother Miriam. As Eliza moves closer and closer to the national spelling bee, the Naumann family finds itself in a spiral of surprising discovery and jarring uncertainty...|`|Cddqq9dBaa	Try and search here.

jVZ7HbDsaa	Setting the scene:    When you have to visit a public bathroom, you usually find a line of women, so you smile politely and take your place. Once it's your turn, you check for feet under the stall doors. Every stall is occupied. Finally, a door opens and you dash in, nearly knocking down the woman leaving the stall.     You get in to find the door won't latch. It doesn't matter, the wait has been so long you are about to wet your pants! The dispenser for the modern "seat covers" (invented by someone's Mom, no doubt) is handy, but empty.     You would hang your purse on the door hook, if there was one, but there isn't - so you carefully, but quickly drape it around your neck, (Mom would turn over in her grave if you put it on the FLOOR!), yank down your pants, and assume "The Stance."      ...You know.... I won't go through the entire thing... some of you won't even read THIS much.... but ultimately....  It's so the other girl can hold the door, hang onto your purse and hand you Kleenex under the door!|`|eksiuO4daa	Because they have orgies in them.|`|faM7RbSHaa	to talk sports  - so that us guys aren't bothering them and yapping in their ears|`|mtyhSPi9aa	coz its not safe to go to the bathroom alone ?  bathroom is one of the safest places to gossip coz its small and u kno whether there's a person in there or not

TDVGgRAWaa	AQUARIUS IS AIR SIGN AND SAGI IS FIRE.  AIR AND FIRE ARE COMPATIBLE.  BOTH ARE INDEPENDENT AND FREEDOM LOVERS.    GOOD LUCK:)|`|rmse6Mj8aa	should be a lot of fun when it's good and some stormy fights when it's bad.   cafeastrology.com has a lot of info on compatibility and your signs, it's too much for me to answer but i i will summarise:    aquarians above all else like their independence. they are intellectual signs and like to rebel from the 'norm' and think outside the box. they hate to be feeling trapped or imposed upon and can be quite aloof.   they are a fascinating and complicated sign and are an air sign.    sag is a fire sign. they too enjoy their freedom but in a larger than life way. they are the life of the party, very into their travel and experiences, and can sometimes be blunt but this is because they enjoy honesty - their enthusiasm can sometimes be tactless but it is meant well. they are not as intellectual as aquarius as they are fire sign which is more about drive.    all this is of course subject to the natal charts of both people. the sun sign can only tell you so much.    you need the dates of birth, years, exact times, and cities of birth to get a natal chart done. there is a free one available on http://astro-software.com/cgi-bin/astro/...    hope this helps. i think it could be a dynamic pairing depending on the mars, the moon, the venus and the mercury compatibilities.|`|64192d3934541ee64b034e0da99e0feaaa	My wife is Aquarius and I am Sagittarius and we have been very happy for 32 years.

18K7ucsEaa	If your main objective is using the guitar to play music by RHCP, then definitely get the Strat. John Frusciante mostly uses a 1962 Sunburst Fender Stratocaster. He's known to also use a 1967 red Fender Jaguar, a acoustic vintage 1950s Martin 0-15, and occasionally a '57 Gretsch White Falcon. The Telecaster will sound a little bit sharper, but a Strat will more closely resemble the original sound of the RHCP music...|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Yes, their guitarist does use a Strat much of the time. I have to say though, I have both and prefer the Tele for everything. I use a Standard Tele with single coils and a Custom FMT HH with Seymour Duncan humbuckers for when I need a fatter sound. Rarely pick up the Strat. Of course I hate being like everyone else, and everyone plays a Strat.|`|5XJ3Nu8aaa	Either one would be fine, but the strat is more versitile, meaning that it can play other things as well as that good as well.

3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	The one about The Joker being in a sequel were probably true. I've heard that one a number of times going back before Ledger died.    Since I can't view IMDb Pro, I can't comment specifically about the two projects you mentioned. However, Christian Bale also has two projects in development that can only be viewed on IMDb Pro. Take that for what you like.    I don't know how common it is, but it's not rare for a director or actor of note to be attached to an unknown project. The listing could be based on something as simple as the actor (or their representative) making a comment to the effect of "...has a couple other projects in the pipeline, but I don't have any details at this time".|`|05CKkwZTaa	After the batman movie came out last summer there was talk of making a batman movie with catwoman.

7kvTHzj0aa	Bass creates the foundation of a melody. I have seen some bands drop tune one of their guitars so low that its almost a bass. ive done that before too. its better to just play an actual bass. drop tuning a guitar to that extent is really hard to tune and has pretty bad sound quality.
9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	It's quite clearly a Shakuhachi (a type of Japanese flute). Very unmistakable sound.    It's not a 'song', by the way. Songs are sung by singers, have words and have instrumental accompaniment. It is better to refer to a 'piece', a 'work' or a 'composition'.|`|Ysnbesz4aa	Sounds like a  Japanese flute to me.

QKBDFP1Raa	It is illegal for the website to post scanned images to the web -  but you happening to find them is not the crime.      But I warn you, many of these sites have TONS of adware that they load to your PC when you get there.  A friend of mine spent last weekend re-formatting his computer because mangafox.com loads as much adware onto your PC as they can.  (If you are on a Mac, no worries).      Onemanga.com seems to be the safe one.      For me, reading online has two problems.  1) You're taking money away from the authors/artists.  2) It just isn't the same to read something online as it is to hold it.  I understand not wanting to pay $10+ for every book - but there are always options to that.      Local libraries carry quite a bit of manga in stock.  Sites, like tokoynh.com sell "gently used" manga for less than 1/2 price of them new.  Also, I've had great luck finding used manga on eBay - just last week I got the complete series of Death Note for $8 to sell in my shop.  (Sold quick!)    So, getting back to your question, it isn't illegal to read the stuff online.  I often do it to preview something new - then buy it from my distributor.|`|FPGqq2Tcaa	wut??|`|vPEupKFvaa	nope but why would you wanna read manga i tried to read the bleach comics coz i wanted ta know what happend next but it was **** i turned straight back to watchin bleach/death note an vampire knight|`|E8go0osDaa	I really don't think so. Most people scan manga and post it online with out permission, which is copyright and is most likely illegal.    But just reading it is fine.|`|6qDhXpWfaa	Yes it pretty much is, especially if they're scans from an english translated manga published here. But it's kind of like downloading music. It's hard to enforce.|`|7xQIDDQRaa	Eh..?  Never heard that before.|`|AFbjjLocaa	i don't think it's illegal to read manga online. Anyway if you read manga online nobody will arrest you.

MDa6OA0Caa	I have asked this question as well to try and find other sites, but the best one is watch-movies.net.

IxP2IMbcaa	Silly You know queefing is better cause you get it from a deep screwing. Farting is just from eating beans and stuff.

Edit: probably some sperm hating bizitch Cleo....it's ok though, I'm used to it.|`|6d576287003e34ff63d6c0f6fc75ff02aa	Queefing|`|3dbcdfaf0fd05fbd593705275133e4bfaa	I wouldn't know which 1 would taste better, I don't think you can eat air, I'll have 2 go w/ farting 'cause it happens more often than chicks queefing.|`|ZlNFOgO7aa	Your friend needs to do their own dirty work and tell us. Now I wanna know, but eeewwww that just grosses me out, I can't even try and be funny about it.    But I agree with Cleo, farts are from digested stuff, queefing is from good times.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Better for what?  They serve completely different purposes!  Queefing blows a warm, gentle breeze over your man, sending chills down his spine.  Farting, on the other hand, is a completely viable method of self defense, a good way to get a cheap laugh (especially from me), and the fastest way to clear out the lines at the bank so you don't have to wait.    As for the flavor, that depends greatly on what items you have currently/recently inserted into the respective orifices.|`|AA12383908	Yulk! please don't do either if you are looking for a friend.

Not so much expecting it from me, but how exciting it will be, the day that she has a grandson/daughter. I am very scared about the whole pregnancy thing, so even if I was to be in a committed relationship and get married..I don't even know if I would like to have kids on my own. I want to adopt, just not at this age, I'm still in college and have a lot to figure out in my life.|`|AA10351606	All I know is that I'm 17 and my grandma (who is 80) keeps reminding me that she'd like to see me get married before she dies, and isn't 21 a nice age to do that (or younger), and she would absolutely love to live to see her great-grandchildren, like her father did. I keep telling her "grandma, I love you very much, but I am not going to decide when to get married and have children based on how much longer you have to live. I would love to have you at my wedding, but that may not be for another 10 or 20 years (my mom got married when she was 38, so why can't I?) and I want to wait until I am ready, not until you are."

G6Uy43coaa	This morning.  I had an "issue" at the gas station and was frustrated,  My oldest son knew I was also exhausted and on the drive to school, he put his hand on mine and told me how much he appreciated me.  He left it there for a few miles and glanced at me periodically.  He probably thought i was going to cry.  We talked on the drive about how its difficult for me to drive so far so early in the mornings, go to work and be productive, get home and make dinner and go to their sporting events.  He listened and he did not appear to be sad when I told him I probably would not be able to afford the private Christian high school he REALLY wants to attend.  He is a good boy.|`|GAxhD5yZaa	like, maybe 3 weeks ago when i actually got to hang out with my crush, i was so happy :D|`|865fb6df82a92ce92b5a489afad80e8eaa	last night when my hubby came home from work he brought me home a Dr Pepper...I know it's small but we were out of Dr Pepper at home, and I didn't have time to go to the store and he knew it and I didn't even have to ask or say anything.. it was soooo sweet.|`|2FsNdcXEaa	I was walking down an empty hallway to class and my best guy friend came around the corner.

It was my Mom's 1973 Mustang, brand new...it had a 302ci motor, I popped out the ignition, it came right out, and turned it over with a screwdriver, I'm not kidding.. I brought it out with 3 friends, went up to the 'extension' a long straight-a-way, and did about 120mph, before the extension ended.     Then we went to a park with long and winding dirt roads, and I drove fast, until we came to one particular bend, when I lost control, and crashed into a tree on the right fender, and spun us around.....    When we discovered that everyone was ok, I drove on, back towards my address, and then we drove down to a remote location, called 'GhostTown' by us locals, since it was very remote, and looked like the ruins of an old town....so there is where I left my mother's Maverick, damaged by the collision.     My friends said that the insurance  would cover it, seeing it as a stolen car.     That was a true story, people. My parents still don't know what happened....I'll tell them on my deathbed..|`|a577675893457f8844900f790e549222aa	No we didn't have a car until I drove but I wouldn't have anyway ; )|`|dvglQDsNaa	Clint Eastwood took me on a joy ride|`|nlKZRNqmaa	yes and the day I did I put a big scratch in the side of the door and got caught skipping school the same day..|`|NYcZsPE7aa	yeap. and was hyperventilating the whole time so i guess it wasn't really a JOY ride lol. but didn't get caught...|`|73ZquQVwaa	hell no! they got some ugly *** cars.|`|kGCd8ioRaa	no|`|4sW8MFxCaa	well i'm not dead so i'll say no.|`|0Df8DrEfaa	didnt have to, i had a old junked car hidden in the woods not far from the house that i managed to get running, i only drove it after dark and on back roads though

I went out and stopped him and asked him nicely if just for a week or two, could he use the other side of the street so that I could work easier with the dog and get it used to him going by.  He started screaming at me, over and over, This is public property and he wouldn't stop.  So I smacked him in the back of the head.  It was just like instinctive.  He just kept yelling at me.  He ran off and called the cops but he told them I spit at him, and I told the cops, No, I hit him in the back of the head. He is just embarrassed cuz I am a girl.  He stopped walking by though.  Knob.

Children all look alike to adults, whether we admit it or not(except our own, of course). So it makes sense to show the pictures to someone who can tell the difference.|`|14gi4aTvaa	Maybe the milk companies are pedos.|`|UinOWcMUaa	ha,ha... funny question !! But it is because many people by milk, so it is a cheaper way of reaching millions of people with keeping the costs low !! :)    Blessings|`|syBq8Yllaa	scare tactic...This is where you'll be if you don't drink your milk.|`|057SUuSYaa	Wait, those kids were missing?  I thought that's what the milk was made from?  Fresh kid squeezings.      Talk about false advertising!  I feel jipped now!|`|Vq49MWgraa	but parents buy the milk cartons...|`|e9Q51Oxyaa	You must have never heard of Milk with Coffee|`|IaK4SRHpaa	Because adults buy the milk and milk is used by almost everyone.|`|oLkNNoICaa	Kidnapped children (those who are kept, rather than murdered) are often put back in school, especially if they've been taken by a non-custodial parent.  They are around other children and so other children may be able to recognize them from the pictures.    Less common, but also possible, is the case that a child may see his/her own picture on the milk carton.  Sometimes children taken by a non-custodial parent may not even realize that they're "missing".  They may have been told that the custodial parent died or didn't want them.|`|UMffILKSaa	Because everyone drinks milk?|`|5a8ede4483b0ca2f267caf5d90461b13aa	1.  Milk expires and the carton is not re-usable.  The printed photo's on the carton will not last long after the child has been found.    2.  Milk is a product used daily. Most people see the face of the child everytime they open the fridge or have breakfast.  It's almost as good as placing an ad in the newspaper.  3.  It's much cheaper than placing an ad.|`|a577675893457f8844900f790e549222aa	Besides the fact that most people buy milk. I think it's also that even if you don't you're bound to buy something from the milk case and may just recognize a kid.

pNlhQa7iaa	Sort of... They don't flat out tell me I'm wrong and I should see someone else, but because I'm only a teenager, they've just refused to believe that my boyfriend and I are serious.     I'll admit, most teenagers do go through very superficial relationships that usually end after about 3 days, but it's still not fair for adults to presume that every single couple under 18 won't last over a week. And if they have, you should see the look on the adult's faces.    It's pretty big for a young person to say they're in love and actually BE in love, but I'm so, so sure of it. My boyfriend has even told me that one day he'll marry me, and I know he's thought hard about it.    So I don't respond, really. It hurts when they remind me of what they think, like saying 'Pfft, but it's not as if they're getting MARRIED or anything...' or asking me why I'm bothering with my relationship if I'm not even in love because apparently I'm not able to fall in love before I'm 18, or things like that... but still, my boyfriend and I know how serious we are, and that's the only important thing. I just let those comments slide, they're not worth clinging on to.|`|D0cz3oJWaa	I am not a teen now but when i was and they did that I rebelled|`|UmAM1cW8aa	I just don't give a damn what they say to me!|`|MdXwD2JSaa	Yeah, my mom does all the time.  It makes me mad because the only reason she doesn't like him is because he's not what she considers 'cute' or 'good'.  She's never given him a chance, either.    I respond by saying, "Whatever, Mom."  Sometimes, if she's really annoying me, I just flat out say shut up.|`|7nRom97Daa	they used to, should have listened to them|`|5MeggG3Laa	im not a teen but i like this Q    no, if they did i wouldnt care becos they dont have any authority over me and even if they did what are they gonna do? they cant stop me from being with the person i love|`|5eArOiRxaa	I'm not a teen, but I've been guilty of doing this with my niece.    My niece had her first real relationship when she was 14. She really thought her and her guy were gonna be together forever and said she "loved" him. I told her several times she didn't know what love was yet. They've broken up.    So to teens, I say that while you may love your significant other, you truly do NOT know what true love is. But you will as you spend more time together and grow with each other. Once you pass the "infatuation" phase, that's when you truly know you love the person.|`|v1zbdURPaa	FUC* YOU....SAY DAT TO UR PARENTS....n just buy a condom n make his CO*K sweat....or wanna have the same fun as if u have a guy?these are the solutions;    1.buy a stick or a LOG  2.pornogaraph*      sorry for my language bt im so freaking serious n dnt lose ur money 4 him...HE should lose money not SHE...

OMG CREAMMMMM|`|dd28c22317b4d1a575582b739470bc71aa	I most definitely would not marry Tobey Maguire, because he and I are from two completely different worlds, lifestyles, and colors.  Besides, he's far too busy being Jennifer Meyer's perfect husband and Ron Meyer's perfect son-in-law.  Also, my feelings for Tobey Maguire are totally gone for good; now, always, and forever.  However, I want to marry a fascinating, charming doctor; one who specializes in Surgery/General Surgery that is positively in my world who will believe in me, love me, provide for me, and respect me; something that Tobey Maguire will never ever understand, because he is forever now married into the world's most perfect family, and he will stay with them for the rest of his life.|`|0QEeXzOEaa	anyone but the jonas brothers|`|AA10716061	I would choose Taylor Swift, she is a really cool and down to earth sweetheart and she is also a really gorgeous looking woman
ZyGyDLsDaa	I'm watching LMN right now~"Disappearance" for perhaps the 12th time. I think it's better than many theatrical releases I've seen lately.     Working backwards in my film journal, here are some Lifetime movies I've watched, having seen many of these  multiple times:  Imaginary Playmate  In Her Mother's Footsteps  They Come Back (2007)  Whispers and Lies  Haunting Sarah  Tempted  Comeback Season  Absolution  She Drives Me Crazy  Gracie's Choice  Murder on Her Mind  First Born  Maid of Honor    I also like these:  Pavement  The Marsh  Tipping Point  Time & Again  A Deadly Vision  Hush Little Baby  Still Small Voices  Critical Assembly  The House Next Door  Lies My Mother Told Me  Plain Dirty aka Briar Patch  True Confessions of a Hollywood Starlet  The Last Dance~starring Maureen O'Hara  Forgotten Sins~I'm a John Shea fan, and you feel so sorry for him because of his hateful, bratty daughters!     Who says guys are the bad guys in Lifetime movies?! Those people do not watch many of the movies then because most men in these movies tend to be supportive and often are victims of "black widow"-type serial killers or other vengeful females. The majority of baddies I've seen are females of all ages, not boys and men.

r8s5j6zOaa	I used to amuse you   I knew that I'd lose you   Now you're here and begging for a chance|`|EBqFpZbjaa	We all like to think we have an opinion and a mind of our own, but I often question this idea, mainly because I'm aware of just how much the media manipulate us as we go about our daily lives.    We might be quite unaware of it, but as we enter our supermarkets to do the weekly shopping, we are from the first moment, being bombarded with images and sounds which make us want to act in a certain way.    Have you noticed how most of us push our trolleys around say in a clock wise manner?  Ever tried going against the flow?  See the "are you totally bonkers" looks you get from people.    Why are we buying Washing Powder Brand X?  When what we desire most is Brand Y?  Have we been brainwashed by the TV ads?    If TV ads are brainwashing us and making us want things, then in the political arena the same sort of brainwashing must be going on.    The truth is that no one has the solution to any problem, not in it's entirety.  Thus we cling to any hope or straw like drowning men in a storm.    Time to look above the parapet and take a couple of shots at it.|`|j6RbKNmjaa	A mind of my own|`|wmBK9uASaa	My mind is mine,all neat and tidy and full of opinions|`|mXumL0Hnaa	sure have.|`|QAwwmDuDaa	My own mind was taken over years ago,i don't know where i begin and end.|`|DIEih5asaa	I will have to ask my wife about that.|`|ZDQHMlGBaa	=/ I'm not sure|`|8q5SeYueaa	No, life is easier to have a set of rules to follow|`|Mb6ZcCGpaa	Not usually|`|jg3CIfm5aa	yes , so my wife tells me|`|NTK4XLuDaa	Many opinions and my mind is my own.|`|uvhq0MGpaa	Sure do I knows jist what I want an I aim ter get it!|`|pIxrdAVKaa	my body has its own mind..creepy huh?|`|z2QYSFlvaa	Definitely, everyone should have an opinion.

Zj8JkvX1aa	All I know is that it starts in the summer. Could you eat Jon Hamm with a spoon? I could.
fHjSonssaa	The biggest question here is- WHAT DID YOU DO?    I think that sort of depends on just how she'll react - or just how nervous you should be.    I will tell you this.  I have done plenty of things that I knew my parents would STRONGLY disagree with- I thought they were going to KILL me.      Even telling my parents that I was pregnant because I'm not married was super scary.  And I'm 28 years old.  I AM with my son's father- we ARE going to get married and my parents even like him.  But I knew they would freak out when I told them I was pregnant. I was only with J a little over 6 months when I found out.  I fretted from the minute I found out until I told them (which was a month or so).  I had to tell them because- hey, I knew they were going to find out.    I think you should just tell her.  LIke I said, I don't know what you did.  BUT, she will be happy you just told her and handled the situation upfront.  After all, YOU yourself are a parent.  What would you want your son to do if he was in your situation?  And she'll respect how mature you are for just telling her.  Once again- I don't know what you did....but since you said she's going to find out- it's WAY better to let her hear it from you-  NOT someone else.|`|5f6XnInEaa	Well, what did you do, silly?|`|vfeUI43Xaa	so wat do u need to tell her>?  ill get someone i know to tell her for you.    x|`|pN90nXhvaa	Consider confessing and get it over with. I'm sure she'll appreciate some honesty and cut you some slack.|`|qS4EG5qYaa	WHAT DID U DO|`|prqrQcd1aa	Well, you have two options... tell her and quit loosing sleep and have her upset for a little while, or.. don't tell her and loose sleep for feeling guilty.    You are taking care of your son, you are doing everything possible for a girl your age to do. She can't be mad at you for that long! Use this as a learning experience, what ever you did, and then move on with your life~|`|c1XvN0BVaa	I think you should just tell her before she finds out from someone else. Good luck.|`|TTnhPnohaa	tell her she'll appreciate the honesty|`|fSRqz7aYaa	AAH!!!    What did you do?|`|mMcrqP6caa	Just go fess up.  It will take the stress of your mind.  It will all come out sooner or later|`|gm3SlwTcaa	well go into your moms room and tell her    thats what i did and sound very worried about  it so she'll kinda feel sorry for you    she'll find out eventually|`|Ci3Efibkaa	write a suicide note|`|aMBAb7lyaa	I agree with  " love ", just get it over with..   She will know eventually.. Just do it now before she hears it from someone else, at least she'll recognize that you had the guts to tell her the truth, and she will eventually appreciated your honesty..|`|xztrmON2aa	Ill take the blame again. k. But you gotta stop littering. Stop the Madness. lol|`|IsX7E5twaa	well, what did you do... how are we gonna help you if we dont know what you did|`|GBSab1Rwaa	There's nothing you can do. Just move on your life, and if you get caught then deal with it. After that, your life should be good again. Do not make the same mistake.    AND DO NOT TELL HER! DON'T LISTEN TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAID!!! Trust me, I have done that before and I regret it so bad. Just wait until your mom finds out because you'll never know that she might will find out or not.

VsamHLPOaa	I would say he's coming to close to it. He is definitely under a microscope right now. Everything he does even the most mundane is being reported like its breaking news. It's getting a lil tired now. The media needs to get over it and report only on the presidential matters at hand.|`|Bzzny3zuaa	no .|`|wRckyuh6aa	hmmmm I don't know i'd put him in the top 10.

However there are people far greater who have lived in the past other than Barack Obama.    Another variable factor in this statement is also that being famous is a perception depending on where you live, how much of the media you view and just your persona.|`|w51B05ACaa	nope|`|8CtqfHgoaa	Is he god? We shall see|`|W0jhffBfaa	most famous president, yes. And there was a question here the other day that asked who barack obama was. So no, not the most famous person.

He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance. His reply Well, after he stopped laughing and could finally take a breath said Its all good.    http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com  http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/s...

My fiance likes video games, and that's no problem at all. I play with him 90% of the time.    But he has friends who barely sleep and skip work to stay home and play video games 20 hours out of the day.    THAT would be a problem.

He loves his video games but not more than me.  I play some with him.  Some times I enjoy blowing stuff up.|`|wS1JDr3Zaa	That's relatively a stupid question, a man can never love a woman as much as a video game (especially when you've prestiged in Call of Duty).|`|YppKG2ruaa	it depends on the guy.. but if i liked him then sure.|`|RAzV6v5Aaa	i would, its cool  i dont think theres anything wrong with it!  not a  big deal, but some woman may think its imature  anywho, good luck with ure wife!!|`|9C6KvSAkaa	It seems childish to me, but I guess if it wasn't like an obsessive thing I would|`|tMghXutuaa	I like playing video games :) And im a girl, I have xbox live lol. And so does my sister and my brothers... LOL! weird...|`|9XK0118Kaa	it depends  if its taking up "me" time..   where hes putting his games first  then no i couldnt  but it really depends on how obsessed this guy is with games|`|lp5YR0HRaa	It's not a problem unless he's obsessed. I play video games and me and my bf take turns|`|oW2UQMRCaa	As long as video games aren't his life, then yeah why not. I've even play with him...games I mean.|`|j4yVOhvIaa	of course...though it'd be embarassing for him when I beat him...and if he pays attention to me at least every once in awhile during the game...

The managers were very uncaring, pretty harsh on us. I was in the deli, and during the evening rush, we'd be expected to run the deli with one person in there for two hours! Management refused to get us help. We'd be expected to close the deli in two hours, even if you were there by yourself, and the managers would never give us help :(|`|giIRzafsaa	yes. they claim that they are not anti-union, but pro-associate. what ever that means. they are evil and need to die.|`|AA11900717	I work at a Walmart.

Wal-mart has also destroyed all of the locally owned mom and pop stores who cannot buy container ships full of products in order to get the bottom dollar prices.|`|r8s5j6zOaa	yes and I love it
jVZ7HbDsaa	They have cartoon avs for a reason....  Think about it!      They don't use a real picture because they have a low self-esteem and take out their depression on everyone over the internet who can't judge them based on looks.     Not saying ALL with cartoon avs... just the rude ones.|`|w5KFkyGRaa	yes i have noticed but i don't really care.|`|3jwXB5araa	well, if you think about, its kinda true. i dont know why though lol.|`|TY96YpbZaa	Yep it's true.

Just had to do that.|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	I think your pretty much right...|`|HrsPCzaBaa	I don't think the avatar has anything to do with it.   You seem to be a stuck up, b*tchy, little kid, with nothing better to do than complain about people online hurting your feelings, and you have what seems to be an actual picture.    It's almost too idiotic to think about.   People online...that are rude? Who would've guessed.|`|65ae5dbf750c54c86214b6a8746d4b43aa	Well apparently you didn't read any of Becky's questions or answers lately cause shes one of the rudest people i ever seen on here and is dumb enough to have a real pic up like someone wouldn't see her on the street and punch her dead in the face. Not being rude just stating facts.

Excuses began, lies etc to try and coax me into caving in. long/short was that she'd never QUIT cheating and it was all a sick game to her. I refused to budge on that detail AND I THANK GOD EVERYDAY  for making me stubborn. (and smart enough to see reality)       Another time pertains to other accomplishments, but the biggies were in the Army. Some of the "quals" I earned are among the most coveted badges in the military. Incredibly tough schooling. Takes years to get yer shot, and %85 washout.

f8d37f51816f93a01c3756a4f407dca2aa	At it's essence, Life is a series of cells working together, multiplying, and living in a union of Constancy with one another in a changing environment.    I really know and believe our lives are defined in a more subtle way. We live, but our existence is defined by our awareness of ourselves and those things we interact with around us.    The best analogy I've read is we're each, in our our way, suns. At our best,  we rise in glory, shed light and joy on those around us, and eventually set with a glorious cacophony of colors, leaving those around us to remember the many memories of our passing.|`|AA10741077	Flying a train...its a highway full of lemon trees and pumpkin boards|`|C3yE261uaa	lottery I never win|`|4c1741cbea09cf16756e8cbf58d11200aa	A roller coaster, its fun as hell, has its ups and downs, and is probably goinng to end too quick.|`|DJyvETGgaa	Life can be compared to Roller Coaster ...

If the Flying Dutchman appears at you, and you have that piece of pie on your fork inches away from your mouth, would you eat that piece of pie? DEFINITELY if i'm going out now I'm not going without my pie >:o  3. You were given a choice of: either being a spirit with your conscience still retained, but you have to roam the this world and the universe for all eternity, even after the whole end of the world thing; OR resting in peace forever. rest  4. Would you free Willy, or laugh at him every time you see him at the park? (Come on, everyone should know what I'm talking about.)it's pretty sad that i dont know i guess :(  5. You favorite finger?

stHol8ITaa	Most definitely, there's too much overwhelming evidence to say otherwise...|`|CRuxWsi0aa	1 chest + 1 butt is greater than but not equal to no boobs and no butt. So yes, Jessica is sexier than Paris.|`|TTnhPnohaa	yeah-im a girl but paris hilton-ew. i find my friends in everyday life|`|o091OaEkaa	"scientifically speaking" - that would probably require some kind of facial analysis for symmetry and proportion, etc.|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	Yes|`|MEd22BHMaa	Jess... all the way. "paris is a whore"...needs a nose job and an attitude adjustment...HO ...HO...HO.|`|I1wwpx69aa	scientifically?...Jessica is sexier|`|UMNJJdsAaa	Yes Jessica Simpson is pretty when you actually look at her. Paris is not.|`|d6d6ba532d5982bcf991fac313dd88a1aa	Scientifically speaking, it's impossible to define sexiness.  That's completely subjective and is in the mind of the observer.  Some might find Hilton's boniness and chicken neck attractive.  Others might like the fact that Jessica Simpson isn't afraid of a little dangerous curve action.  I'm a chest man myself, so I gotta go with Jessica Simpson all the way if we're basing this only on physical looks.    If we factor brains into this discussion, they both get a big thumbs-down.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	I think Jessica is higher on the Richter Scale than Paris Hilton|`|HfHvF4Vkaa	They are both ditsy. But to pick one, Jessica is much sexier.|`|gvnNy7Rtaa	No way.  Jessica is a whine baby.|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	The equation is off... it can't be proven, even though the laws of nature applies that Paris Hilton is a f*cking who----|`|m4q3hikbaa	Jessica Simpson! Paris Hilton is to skinny!|`|m2vBJaHKaa	no jessica is hotter paris hilton isnt even that goodlooking|`|mMcrqP6caa	Yes I think Paris looks like a man!  Talks like one too|`|ql7fDxI5aa	hmmm, I like calculus, which is to say I like curves. So definitely Jessica Simpson.|`|GfphOIdOaa	I think Dame Edna is sexier than Paris Hilton. I think a lot of people are sexier than Paris Hilton.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	Yes, but I also expect Jessica to start quacking at any minute.  Something about those duck lips.  Paris is not attractive at all and those feet...what size are those boats?|`|2b48276b9853c62d36478108dff9629baa	Jessica has a warmth and peacefull aura about her...... Pariss comes across as being vapid.    So that would be a resounding yes from moi.    peace baby  ?|`|RYhlcOneaa	F*** Yeah!            pardon my french|`|vXOreO4Uaa	Jessica Simpson though she won a lil bit of weight but she's still gorgeous.

Paris has tiny lips lol|`|ty3nnq2uaa	I'm not speaking scientifically   but sure man!!   jessica is much much better than paris|`|JQMajdtvaa	hell no.|`|GBSab1Rwaa	100 times better than that whore Paris Hilton.|`|9OMEGZiZaa	What do you mean scientifically speaking?? Attraction is based on personal taste, and IMHO, they are both really not that attractive.|`|xz98PNLEaa	Scientifically I think they both need a lot of help. I do not find either sexy. sorry|`|kOAXmQ51aa	scientifically speaking, they both look slutty.|`|aMBAb7lyaa	Honestly.. I am a girl.. but I can definitely see that even a dog is sexier than paris hilton..   Her look is so trashy..|`|d0e1b5b2af884d02c8c1a86fcdf900caaa	Without a doubt, Jessica Simpson is sexier. There's a difference between being classy sexy and trashy sexy.|`|1133b5d38a3d30a09c2b1c70499eaaf9aa	Jessica Simpson is way more sexy than Paris Hilton|`|74mefTG5aa	sure, she's buxom!

You just wasted 5 points buddy...Yeah you would be cooler..No one wants to be around someone that smells like cigarettes and has dirty fingernails|`|g3yfUOjQaa	whatever...get over it already you're not cool|`|DzIlM76Xaa	You'd probably have better breath.|`|ef831d986a5932fbeb4aaba747db2c77aa	It's your life.  I smoked for 15 years and quit 3 years ago. Hopefully you will eventually before you get lung cancer or COPD.|`|JxgzRkk3aa	Yes, way cooler.|`|uR8mnKjnaa	yess...    but whatever   -sinks your ship  -floats your boat  -peels your banana|`|3vJoA7bzaa	Most definatly. Guys who smoke are quite and very gross!|`|Dlj76n2daa	duh smoking is ****!|`|TTnhPnohaa	i would think you were MUCH cooler :]|`|j7OfrcD0aa	yeah, cuz i dont thing cancer is cool|`|JQMajdtvaa	if you're addicted, then i suggest calming down a bit.  i don't really care if a guy smokes as long as they're not addicted to it.|`|Pxz9MCaHaa	Ya because it is not good for you and shortens your life expectancy. And if you quit it proves you have self control and strong will power...which are good qualities to have|`|sGQ9m4Ajaa	Dude, just because you asked this on yahoo answers makes me think your lame.  >.|`|TqDc7w91aa	**** no. i wouldnt think you were cool either way|`|5i09rH7Taa	It takes a strong person to quit smoking so yes.  Definitely a turn on.|`|uD7giDNjaa	Smoking is gross.  Don't do it.  I would find you much more attractive if you quit.  The smell of smoke on a man is a definite turn-off.    Do you know all the risks of smoking?  Lung cancer, Emphysema, Gang Green. Should I continue?|`|iIPwAWJTaa	yeah when ur young ur cool but when ur grown up at your 40's u would regret it because it is taking your life little by little...its your choice and it was the pathway you chose and as long as you live you can change that- just hope its not too late when u regret....|`|NlxmeCWDaa	I think you are stupid whether you smoke or don't.  But you are stinky and stupid and you like it!    Oh yeah- and you are paying money to give yourself cancer.  good going!|`|dXDQtrjvaa	there are so many reasons you should stop smoking.  i can tell you from experience that lung cancer should be the main one.  I remember when my mom was first diagnosed with lung cancer, she had to get a lung removed and had a two foot long incision on her back with like 137 staples.  Then she had chemo and radiation, lost her hair and her will to live.  Soon after it spread to her other lung, heart and brain.  I watched her cough blood for hours before she finally died...bad way to go bud.  im just going to be blunt and tell you if you are secretly considering the coolness factor then you are just a sad lamb and you need to follow the wise words of Grandmaster flash and check yo self b4 you riggidy wreck yourself.|`|73ZquQVwaa	if its ganja, then yes...but wacky tobbacy, naw.|`|EeThBc3Zaa	Yes.      Your loss.|`|4sW8MFxCaa	whatever floats your boat=]|`|8ZUVToXgaa	lol then what's the ****ing point of our opinions?    I mean that was funny but what's the point in asking us?    I think you'd be sexier if you didn't smoke, yes.    But if you don't wanna, it's on you.|`|10QSTGWAaa	I would think you would, because it means you have the guts and determination to change something about yourself, even if it's difficult.    But since you're going to keep smoking, you're just going to stay a loser I guess, hahaha.    Jk.|`|lB7PX2Voaa	I quit smoking on Saturday. I 'feel' way cooler.|`|95C3UsASaa	yes I hate smocking breath     (HUGE TURN OFF)|`|M7lOK6DWaa	deffinatly. i dont go for guys who smoke.

Fruits and vegetables move through your system quickly and help clean you out.  It's when you eat a bunch of crap that you get stopped up and don't use the bathroom often.|`|c3ed7dc313b7c0181d81e54a991e8038aa	what goes in must come out|`|shjHhkwJaa	laxatives?lol|`|qTHkBmH6aa	um...haha.how should i answer this?    no i wouldnt|`|Yb72J5zDaa	because the person probably takes in up the bum a lot and that acts like a laxitive.|`|zY64xc6xaa	It's a good thing.

Mellow gold and odelay, those are the only beck albums I like.|`|YwqfYVPbaa	I'm thinking Mellow Gold. It's an oldie, but a goody. Guerro wasn't bad, but you need the classic background to compare it to first. After, Mellow Gold, go Odelay, then Guerro, and then sample some of the more folksy stuff like Sea Change.

Losing my virginity was pretty much everything I dreamed it would be, candles, music, he took it slow and was really sweet about the whole thing.  definitely fireworks,because it was true lovemaking, not mindless sex.|`|4ioDEbRpaa	I don`t pity any of the bitches who I popped......ole!

The next day, his wife gets two ridiculously-expensive BMWs. So that night he wishes for a million dollars. The next day his wife gets two million dollars.

SxJzPmvzaa	I Don't understand why people would've "laughed" at someone's death.|`|yUInFtXyaa	When I first heard the news of Steve Irwin's death, I was shocked. As I watched the footage of him on tv, I felt sad for his wife and his kids.|`|n7vsfdplaa	Didn't feel either way about it. I thought he was a complete tool making americans talk to us like we're idiots but I'm not happy someone died.|`|Prm1ImPPaa	I could'nt stop laughing|`|JMjZwvPKaa	mate, ma boi still be kickin' it.|`|63f8c54601344cad6630399f351d9069aa	He got all his fame, going to america, after he got into financial debt, here in Australia..and the creditors were after there money. In fact he should have stayed there in USA...to me he was just a show pony...never liked him.|`|GLQLURTraa	I felt like throwing a massive party, I was stoked.  That guy was an disgrace to all australians.  God, if I ever said CRIKEY!  I would take a desert eagle and top myself to save the rest of the population wanting to do it for me.    Very few Australians actuallt act like that.  We are not morons who flaunt our stupidity in the face of dangerous animals.  We do not say Crikey.  We do not act that obnoxious. (well not all of us.)  And We DO NOT Hold our babies in front of a maneating crocodile.  Only a freaking lunatic would do that.  In my books, he is just like wacko jacko.  One holds the baby over the edge of a balcony, one in front of a dangerous animal.  Why else do we have jokes here like:    Why should Steve Irwin have used suncreen?  To protect himself from the harmful Rays.|`|cix8nCpmaa	***irwin not erwin and the people who wanted to throw a party and laughed you are sick how can you laugh at someones death even if you dont like them|`|AA12016863	Why does everyone on here think so negatively all the time. On the one hand, the people who liked him now mourn his death, feel depressed, and try to spread their sickness to others who liked him. On the other hand, the people who didn't like him forcefully express how stupid, fake, or irresponsible he was. Don't hate me ppl, I'm just telling it like I see it, and I see a lot of miserable, judgemental, and/or condemnative people.  Consider how educational Steve's efforts were for young people and people youg at heart, who want to travel in wild places in outback Australia, and all over the world, and have never seen or heard of a potentially harmful or fatal animal except on Steve's TV shows or in Steve's Australia Zoo, and that knowledge saves their life. Or the extensive areas of the wild that have become UNEP protected because Steve identified it as the habitat of an endangered species. He fought tirelessly, with the heart of a warrior, to protect and serve the biodiversity of life on this planet, our only home, and should be remembered as a hero  that died doing what he loved, not remembered based on his not being here to continue.   Things change, because that is the only certifiable constant in the universe. People die, but ideals go on. Remember them for how they lived, and if you have enough inner strength, you can try to continue his good work, and not only help his legacy live on, but leave your own in his wake.  "Be the person you wish to see in the world." - Mahatma Gandhi

This was my older brothers favorite movie when they were kids|`|BBItH3eFaa	Still love it now!|`|CdTe8MO4aa	very awesome movie :-D|`|kGCd8ioRaa	it was ok|`|AA12383908	I thought the big dog was something else.

Just remember if you fallow the rules things do not get deleted as much :)|`|mggll8dRaa	'Taking a Shower' is a 'dirty' subject.......!!|`|heEN0Zghaa	Maybe you just accidentally clicked on it, I mean it's very close to the 'answer this question' button!|`|oKyimeaMaa	2 words: Clint Eastwood|`|QpPzXqIVaa	what? ... i don't get it.... did somebody report you? if so don't worry, i get reported all the time..... for reasons unknown....|`|TWGWMe5Daa	put the joint down...
ZOQrtm5zaa	NO!|`|RPgneHpmaa	They sure are big shoes to fill... what if it is the real Clint Eastwood?|`|uE2aOqeNaa	unfortunately for them, yes|`|mggll8dRaa	There is only One, and Nobody else could come close...!!    Kudos to "Dirty Harry" & "Josie Wales", et al......!!|`|mBlcD6sRaa	come on that was him    i saw his face|`|dlqa6yFkaa	Are you saying that is not really clint eastwood? I'm heartbroken.|`|Z55OptjDaa	Will the real Clint Eastwood please stand up|`|ff772a25081c886385c2eb6a501e148aaa	Yeah, right. Next thing you'll be saying is there are people who imitate Elvis.
n5z1K8HCaa	I hadn't heard Sepultura before. The beggining was pretty bad-a**. What are some more cool songs? And by the way, what the heck's your problem with Disturbed? Seriously, It's like they did something to you. Just go to my profile and answer my question. You'll know which one. I answered yours about Disturbed copying Slayer BTW.
rIFqv8nvaa	I like inside the fire for its ascending scalar solo.|`|7oC5tO9kaa	Ten Thousand Fists(madden 06)|`|1bvl5zbkaa	striken.|`|o9p5kn1Baa	stricken. because its my favorite to play on guitar hero. lol.|`|2a4mNOxmaa	"Stricken" for it's awesome solo.|`|DCRteYE2aa	Currently Remember, but it changes all the time
7ZLS2AbNaa	I will for season 10  I met Blake lewis and got a picture with him!(he was with his friends and brother and super nice :))  I saw kellie pickler on the ellen show :)|`|8ada4f62b68d5b19c59d4fc405f8fab5aa	I sooo want to! but they never come close to my state anymore...I know of a person who has though
yxtj5LUaaa	Wow, thats why she wont let you have them? Thats weird. I would just tell her that, thats no reason to not let you have them....people with tattoos arnt always bad, and tattoo artists arnt all bad either..thats just prejudist....just keep working on her.*|`|lIQhB56Oaa	Tell her half of the money is going to be donated to charity.|`|YSdwkhHRaa	Tell her that she doesn't make sense. You made the effort to save up for the shoes, so you should be damn well allowed to wear them.    At least they're not clear high heels.|`|KDrztUEpaa	My cousin had the same problem. He wanted something Ed Hardy, but his mom wouldn't let him cause it was designed by a tattoo artist.     If you want to get down and technical, Don Ed Hardy was a tattoo artist, he never made clothes. Christian Audigier (or whatever lol) makes the clothes with hardy's designs.     I don't really like Ed Hardy, but the shoes I do like, Hopefully she will be reasonable and let you get them,     i am a firm believer in that whatever money you get (allowance) should be yours to spend however you like.|`|be1a534f2111d7885e62e1990487420aaa	I know that you are supposed to walk a mile in someone else's shoes to truly understand them, but think about poor Ed, what will he wear whilst you have his shoes on......slippers?    Sorry, not much help really I know, but surely a pair of shoes is a pair of shoes, why waste ten times the money because everyone tells you Ed Hardy is so cool, find a nice pair of shoes that you like for the design, the cut, the comfort and the durability, not a pair that are 10% substance and 90% bullshit and then maybe your Mum will be a bit more understanding.    Sorry not to agree with you I just hate wasting money (and suspect your Mum feels the same).    Good luck|`|CZ7qqnhsaa	just tell your mom that even though they are designed by a tattoo artist that you are smart enough to not get one if that is why she wont let you get them. hopefully your mom will understand. if you do get them, they are so comfortable. i have a pair and i love them.|`|QLOCznKTaa	Find an outfit that they go perfectly with...and then show her how well they look...also try telling your mom that just because they're designed by a tattoo artist doesn't mean anything...tell her that you are the one that has to wear them and that you really like them|`|vVofB4DPaa	Just keep begging until she's ready to climb up the wall and go insane.  Hopefully, she'll give in at that point.    LOL .. good luck !|`|NeAgoZj7aa	Listen to your mom!|`|cnCnSsWraa	i goy 3 pair of ed hardy myself cool shoes. but i don't know why u have to tell your mom that those shoes were design by a tatoo artist ether way your mom is pretty square is nor like your having a tatoo.|`|73ZquQVwaa	wow.....its just a pair of shoes lol. Um..just buy em...i bet she doesn't even know what they are....and if she says what are those, just say they are ecko Unlimited or Vans shoes....something like that.
fcEqR3yFaa	What's wrong with the Tyra Banks show is that she has no talent as a talk show host, has a group of writers who are out of touch, and she is more interested in showing her fashions and makeup than in dealing with anything real.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	I'm watching it now too.

95K3Xd6Raa	That's Billie Holiday by Warpaint|`|zRmwEFAwaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Guy    As one of Motown's signature hits, "My Guy" has been covered often, with versions by Dusty Springfield, The Supremes, Petula Clark, Claudine Longet, Margo Smith, and more having been recorded over the years. The cover version of the song with the biggest chart impact in the United States was by Sister Sledge in 1982 ( 23). One notable cover, used in the Whoopi Goldberg film Sister Act, substitutes "My Guy" with "My God", transforming the song into a faux-gospel number. In 1980, Amii Stewart and Johnny Bristol recorded it as a duet in a medley with another Motown classic, the Temptations' "My Girl"; it reached only  63 in the U.S.  In 1999, "My Guy" was inducted to the Grammy Hall of Fame.

z1H5BIIKaa	Because they're all christians and they have a christian record label. Some of their songs are christians too. Like the Color of Water and Luv Addict.|`|sopAuW7Zaa	that's like asking "why is the pope catholic?"    -yawns-    i would, however, surmise that their affiliation with the "god-rock" genre would be mainly due to the record label that they're signed with.    it's ironic because most of the major "christian" labels are simply branches off major secular labels.

Y5jv0ybFaa	I'm beginning to wonder if Erica is capable of loving anyone but herself. She proved that during Bianca's shower yesterday. They should have had a funeral no matter what he did. I guess that vision of him  while she was looking at his photo was it.|`|Ho4xK8DDaa	I couldn't agree with you more, there needed to be some kind of memorial for Josh.  And Jeff should've come back to grieve for his son.  I know they all didn't know Josh that well (even though he was family to a lot of them in Pine Valley), but, still...there should've been some kind of memorial service.|`|50d942fb9cb02a07ad994afcd5ea15fdaa	I wondered the same thing. It was just "get out his heart, give it to Kendall" then that was it for poor old Josh.  Maybe they still will have something, who knows.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I know, I was wondering if they were ever going to address this. Clearly they only brought Josh back to kill him and save Kendall, but shouldn't Erica say SOMETHING about a funeral or memorial service? She was thinking about him and "saw" him in her mirror today, maybe she'll still say something (even if there is no on-screen service).|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I know, if they were gonna concoct this stupid story of an unabortion, they could at least gave him a better ending! Erica is selfish always has been, always will be!|`|YIcBd569aa	I am an all my children fan. I have to say I agree with you it was all too phony even for a soap opera. everyone just got back to their lives, no one even questioned zach? he knew what he was doing. he shot josh in the head not the heart on purpose to save kendall. and he probably lured him there. kendall will wake up this week or next. and josh is laying in an morgue somewhere with his heart torn out. I hate this storyline it was poorly written and acted and it felt rushed. like they just wanted to quickly resolve the whole josh scenario and move on. josh was originally a good guy and they turned him into a monster overnight. this story line for me was terrible.|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	Good question......another example of AMC going down the toilet.....None of this story makes good sense to me.|`|AA12390047	Not even a memorial service.  I think Erica really loved Josh in her own way.  And all people grieve differently.   Erica always turns to work and snaps at everybody when she's like this.  EDIT:  And I would think Jeff would come back or we might see or hear from him.  Good grief, this was his SON!!!  All I heard was that Dr. Joe said he'd call Jeff.  EDIT AGAIN:  Thursday - saw Erica briefly remembering Josh.  (I was in an appliance store - will watch tonight.)  So maybe there was some sort of service or closure for Erica.

Technology: Save. Technology is always improving. I got this idea because I once bought an Apple iPod touch, and the next day, they came out with one that has external speakers.    Necessities: Definitely spend. Don't take a risk by only buying the items you need that moment. An example of when this strategy becomes useful: if you only buy a food supply for one day and there's a storm and you're trapped inside your house, that could be bad.    Overall: I recommend that you save. Who knows when the thing you just bought may have an improvement?|`|beJcBzWiaa	spending is more fun but i have to save in order to have something to spend|`|MDsUNZIHaa	save... so that i could spend it when needed...  haha...|`|spo9KBRpaa	save... for a 'rainy day'|`|hBDwpwvKaa	hey i try to save but at the end of the spend.|`|mBlcD6sRaa	both but always save|`|UmAM1cW8aa	Both.......but spend most cause i dn when i be done huh|`|1hiImyBdaa	Save.

1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	My stepdad said it wasn't all that great. Only cool thing was Kate Winslett naked for a good portion of the movie.|`|whE5OQ26aa	Kate Winslet is one of those frosty, stuck-up English women. I have never liked her, and I won't support this movie. Notice Revolutionary Road hasn't even been considered for wide release, along with The Reader?     Theater execs totally passed on it. They knew it wouldn't sell tickets.

AA11547249	It depends on what message you are trying to send.  I think I have a better chance of getting in bed with girls with piercings, but would consider less a girl who is wild as someone i would want to get serious with.  It doesnt define you as a person though, and if you have a cute belly button as my girl did, the hole kinda ruins it.  I'd wait it out six months and if you still feel like getting one, get it.  Don't do it spontaniously.  The hole takes for ever to go away.|`|bFfdbWk2aa	no don't i told my younger sister the same thing don't get it pierced|`|QpPzXqIVaa	ugh, no.|`|s1leABaSaa	YES & GOOD|`|ZnXk0nlYaa	YES!!  i have my belly pierce i think its cute.|`|d12a585a9f486535d07b0683ef24b00eaa	nah  i don't like people piercing themselves or tattooing themselves either|`|WyxxDgSeaa	Sure, if you want to look like one of the herd. Nothing original there.|`|9m9gHZhpaa	nah. infections reaaaaally suck. and they're not that cute..|`|Gn8EhYRuaa	yes! i did mine (=|`|uQaVvVHtaa	yea i have mines.   it's super cuuuuute.  if you remove it there's a hole; but it closes up quickly.  there will jus be a scar.    go for it; it doesn't hurt! :)|`|dlBlVHvXaa	If you can put up with the healing process...sure!  I have mine done and it took over a year to heal completely.|`|clqgFUFFaa	I find it...lame and I think only latins can pull it off|`|6mZJSqBgaa	Yes, they're cute.  But DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT pierce it yourself.  You won't have to worry about an infection if you get it done professionally.|`|m7OGosdtaa	I have mine done.. its a silver bar with a blue gem on the bottom circle bit.. its pretty. :) if you clean it properly it wont get infected. sooo.... yes!|`|ij9N9r5waa	Your actual belly or are we talking the shin around the belly button?  belly button Yea it's cool if you are 18+  actual belly  R U NUTS?|`|1wQeH0hdaa	I think they are cute...|`|dicjbwtCaa	Yes i have it pierced !|`|9Y9BBB99aa	i think there sexy|`|Ges0ZeDjaa	i think you should and is very cute|`|F4BIqnWoaa	Nope.  Do something a little more original.  Every skinny girl has her button pierced.. get an industrial or something fun like that.  :)|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	yes it is cute for a while    except when i got pregnant, i took it out so it wouldnt stretch the hole. it grew up and i havent got it repierced so now when i wear a bikini i have a little stupid looking hole above my belly button :p    btw... infections hurt like hell|`|suojKPfPaa	I genuinely don't think it's cute. It just screams something bad to me, if you catch my drift.|`|90MSfEGSaa	yes life is too short it only gets infected if you don't take care of it and the hole closes|`|XSDVNJeAaa	Bad looks awful|`|eOsg3JiGaa	if you want, then sure.  i don't really care for them though.|`|AB8nUS3uaa	i have mine done.. it got infected but i left it in and kept it clean and it healed so i didn't have to remove it.. get it done!!|`|FUQtpQByaa	yes!|`|mous0VADaa	umm HECK yes|`|26d067d5b3e70c8714e2435eb3667f89aa	Well, it kinda depends on a couple of things.  1.  How old are you?  2.  How slim are you?    If you're young and slim, then go for it.  That is one of the most attractive of body piercings that you can get.  Your tummy will only be slim and flat for so long (especially if you have kids).  If you take good care of it, you won't get an infection.  Also, if you remove it the hole will close up.  The belly button piercing doesn't really get stretched so you don't have to worry about it getting bigger and saggy.    My opinion is: get one!|`|4ioDEbRpaa	Pierce your clit instead..|`|oUdo4kBYaa	do it wolfy says|`|5kDQLFhraa	ive had mine pierced for 6 years and i love it!!    go for it :)|`|cnsryMxSaa	yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes|`|QRcBM5PZaa	yes def|`|isEUxMXsaa	yeah i have mine pierce  itz going to get infected zomehow  i went trhough it   then it went away|`|cRJgZMV1aa	I think it would be pretty cute as you call I call it hot. & you won't always get an infection if you remove it, as long as you keep it clean. And most of the time the holes will seal up.|`|NJrsrT12aa	they're cute, but if you get it caught on something or lay on your stomach quickly and the wrong way, they can rip out easily ripping your skin, causing it to bleed everywhere and an infection.      i heard it hurts like all hell when you get it peirced too.      so if you want the risk go for it, they have some cute belly rings out there
xau9ucWoaa	sorry.  i was hungry.  i didn't know you wanted some too.|`|7LdjNoX7aa	the communists|`|4GiIXWUXaa	whhaaaatt?

K5ezVimbaa	I'm Gen X, and i know where you're coming from.     The media keep misrepresenting us as useless, lazy, addicts, etc.     There are teenagers who are impressive, such as Melissa Wu, but they are represented as separate from the mainstream teenagers.|`|YSdwkhHRaa	I didn't know we were called video-game addicted drunks. I thought we were lazy, hedonistic sex-addicts.    Every teenager strives to be respected. Don't sweat it, man. I felt the same way when I was your age.|`|2C43Y9qJaa	All that coming from a Kamikaze Watermelon huh......?|`|8q5SeYueaa	Every generation thinks the new generation are a bunch of hooligans, even though our generation was full of a bunch of hooligans too|`|z06mMAieaa	I Agree. And Im 15.     But i think that theres bout 75% of drunk teens.   Most of my friends sadly.|`|W5ITQuqFaa	I`ve yet to see that 3% so until then,I`ll paint all of you with same brush...|`|GBSab1Rwaa	Haha, almost every single teenagers that I know, they all party and drink many boozes. Not all the teenagers are like that, of course. Today, many kids are become more greedy, rude, and don't care about many things. Pretty sad eh?|`|vFGqsdQnaa	Not really, but I understand where you're coming from.   I had a Maths Teacher who (metaphorically speaking) had an iron pole shoved up her @$$.  She was 56 years old and she makes Gen-X ers look bad in general. I had never met someone so stuck-up and self-centred before. Our Maths class was well-behaved and we all did our best to achieve good results; but she always pointed out the negative qualities of Generation Y. She even mentioned a newspaper article that supposedly proved her point and she reminded us everday that we were the generation that ''screwed up'' ..and that we were lazy + disobedient.   I've graduated from high school already but I occassionally have nightmares involving her.. *shudders* >    Generation X-ers can be good people. It's the minority that makes everyone else look bad.|`|MximiAuCaa	well i cant talk about being drunk|`|HfHvF4Vkaa	Doesn't matter what generation a person is in--- people have always thought that. Its not fair, nor right, but they have.      This is from I guess you would call Another Generation...|`|UjPArJZ6aa	Generalisations are such a *****, aren't they?  :P|`|mMcrqP6caa	Its a generalization  And we learn everything from the previous generations.|`|XS3PexPIaa	What's wrong with the description they give about us? I wouldn't mind if someone told me I'm a drunk video game addicted hoon, this doesn't mean I won't be ruling the world later on :p
eNR2iot8aa	That is sad and embarrassing for them, your probably a future chef.|`|GBSab1Rwaa	Yeah, I can cook better than my parents too. I'm smarter than my step-mom, pretty sad eh? But my dad is smarter than me still.|`|gvnNy7Rtaa	You should start making your own TV shows.

It just disappeared.|`|t7qcjqWIaa	LOL, I remember that stuff. Personally, I always liked Big Red better, and it had about the same amount of caffeine. And you're right, now there's all kinds of other energy drinks out there with the same or more caffeine...oh well, cest la vie|`|OJAC44eTaa	yes, omg...blaaacchhh....hoooooaahh. evil stuff.|`|Jm6mkvlWaa	I so remember it! I loved it only because I thought the can looked cool!!    Personally, I prefer the word "pop." Of which Mt. Dew is my fave!

dlSjuihjaa	First make sure you use extra firm tofu.  Tofu absorbs whatever flavors you put on it so press out the water and if you want it to be chewy then freeze it, but that takes too long.  After you press it you can either cut it up and marinate it in some sauce or put it right into the pan.  I usually sprinkle it with curry, salt, and Mrs. Dash and put in some vegetables too.|`|RbmVnoozaa	hmm,  you could try soy sauce, or hot sauce, or pepper.  and why dont you eat meat?|`|DPJRlxOwaa	Tofu cant be flavorized. Try salt. If that doesnt work, sorry SOL.
4sW8MFxCaa	not yet  nothing has made me happy enough|`|2V3JZ3Wbaa	Yes, lots of time. I think it is good for a person to show their emotions when happy times happen.

The last time was a couple of weeks ago on my birthday.|`|OI29tkSoaa	Nope|`|mne7kd8Taa	Absolutely - that's why people cry at weddings - I think they get overwhelmed and don't know what other emotion to express when they feel that way.|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	Yes, and it is a great feeling...I don't embarrass easily...so I let the tears fall where they may...and I find it very endearing when gentlemen offer their handkerchiefs...|`|YxXBrRq4aa	yes, i did at my best friends wedding and the birth of my children|`|1f6d00843ad961970bfb2d9d9379df6baa	No but my daughter did when we suprised her with tix to the circus.

I accidently left a door open without realizing it and by the time I did notice my 6 month old puppy Milo was gone.  I have never felt so scared and sad at the same time.  He's such a little guy and I could just picture him getting hit by a car or stolen.  After looking all day I went home to make posters on my computer.  As I was walking outside to get in my car...I saw him running up my driveway!  I was sooo relieved and happy I couldn't help but shed a few tears!|`|mHXLJKzRaa	yes during a good good good movie...quite rare though|`|AA11178767	Yes I have...|`|CmJwqeJ5aa	hmmm the first time i was proposed too.... the day i gave birth to my daughter...the day she said mama...|`|7R1VYuQ2aa	yes.  at a concert. my friend has pictures.   thats sad. haha
VCIexeqyaa	Ive been a Ghost Hunters fan since they first came out.   Their first 2 or 3 seasons are very credible, at least to me.    I feel that they started to fake evidence since Kris came along.  The episode that was notoriously fake was the last live halloween special. You can check on youtube how fans uncovered the truth behind their findings.    Even though they have changed (probably because SciFi demanded a couple of more evps, ghost sights etc. and theyll get more ratings = money), I think that they were the most ''credible''. Because their intentionts were to disprove hauntings and try to look at the natural explanations first before jumping to the conclusion that theres supernatural going on there. I still enjoy watching the show and GHI for entertainment purposes.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	The most unbelievable are the breasts of the girls on VH1 Rock of Love. ( ok maybe a couple are natural but, they are in the minority).|`|IiB6nXn5aa	I like ghost hunters but what make me mad about them if they find something. Why don't they go back the next night with more cameras.  Also some of the people doing the investigating talk too much. they are always running their mouths when they hear voices or noises.|`|JMjZwvPKaa	Lost Tapes fo sho|`|QY48ErA3aa	casper|`|mqcVaxMvaa	Bigfoot sucking off a leprecaun.

Vhq3GURQaa	The answer is yes. It was even used with success to carry messages in battles. Today some people keep homing pigeons. They have an ability to find there way home when let loose. There are clubs and competitions, mostly in NY (that I am aware of) So, the next time, you get that pigeon poop in your hair, don't be mad.........it could be carrying a important message.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Yeah, there cool.. we use to have some and breed them. But pigeons even if in the trunk of a car can naturally find their way back home through instinct. During the early wars, they were used as messengers, and were attached with a little note on their feet to give positions of their enemies. Nowadays they have e-mail and instant messaging.. so no longer a need in today's society :) Unfortunately|`|KH9bbeCNaa	u get them in "IMAGINATIONLAND"|`|14gi4aTvaa	I'm not sure about pigeons but I know for sure that there are owls that carry messages! Go to Diagon Alley...|`|heF3HIzQaa	Yes. Try a google search for a local carrier pigeon club. I know it is very popular in the UK, I do not know how popular it is in your location.|`|6ik7OJRNaa	..... love doves.......

They used them in WW1 a lot. I'm sure they could still be trained.|`|WoEsehoRaa	Homing Pigeons|`|HWyhc5rdaa	You can get one near a park, mall, or major bridge.  Yes you can train a young one to land here or there.  You can even attach a note to it's leg.  But alas they have a mind of their own and can fly where they want to if you turn them lose.   But they go to where they feel at home and comfortable.    Better yet add unlimited texting to your cell plan.  LMAO|`|8272JH3uaa	Pigeons have the ability to fly back to a certain play because of their good homing systems. So back in the day nobles and kings used them to send messages.     I doubt you could actually buy one though!     These pigeons will only go back to a place. You can't give them directions of anything.    But who knows. You could become a crazy pigeon breeder and it might work out for ya.    Good Luck!|`|faM7RbSHaa	yeah, there def are....    this is a good question. I think it would be bad a$s to have one!|`|E3RDbAaIaa	Lol    I dont have a clue  but I guess that is just the thing Hollywood wants us to believe|`|Yj33dIoJaa	They belong more in the old days.

Jin has a more traditional style but dont think of this as a weakness because his skills are amazing. The two contrasting samurai warriors are far from friends, yet their separate paths seem to cross anyways. Mugen is wandering aimlessly through the city when he stumbles upon a teahouse where he meets Jin and Fuu (A ditzy waitress, but dont think she doesnt have anything hidden up her sleeves). Fuu convinces them both to come with her in search of a mysterious samurai that smells like sunflowers and their journey begins.

Here's my point: If you will commit dishonest, you can not sleep that night, your conscience will arrest you (if you have), and you will reap what you sow. Somebody will make dishonest act on you in the future. But if you play honesty, maybe the bank will reward you, and besides, your child (if you have) will imitate you, and you have a good story to tell them. Choose between the two.|`|kOAXmQ51aa	This has happened to me before. Luckily it happened during banking hours so I decided to return 'cause there are security cameras all around. About a year after that incident, I had an unlucky incident with an ATM machine in another province (state is what you call it in your country). The ATM debited my withdrawal but no cash came out of the machine! When I reported it to the head branch they immediately fixed the problem and didn't have a hard time in getting my money. It was good karma, I think.

Don't worry, I don't either.|`|ko3J5akPaa	Yes i dislike valentines day because  Valentines day is the biggest hallmark holiday known to mankind. To put it simpler this holiday was created mainly for money-making purposes.  Women go insane and become engulfed in their emotions for "love". while stupid, infatuated men run around trying to find gifts for their significant other in order to "prove their love" and fulfill the "meaning" for that day.  But the truth behind Valentines Day is that its a part of a government conspiracy to get humans to breed and build up the nations population. Also meaning that Valentines Day is a reminder to all people that love and being in a relationship is a society norm, and that if you are not in a relationship, you should take this day as a chance to try and be in one.   While people's thoughts are clouded by emotions and their hormones go insane in anticipation for sex, attention is drawn away from the government.  Then those who are left out from the mating game fall into depression or jealousy, and possibly end up committing suicide: another government plan of cutting out the useless.    Oh and stay away from those little boxes of candy hearts. They might cause cancer or something.    So in conclusion Valentines Day is just a meaningless holiday we should toss it aside and move on with our lives.|`|MAGcwMUfaa	i hate it.   a woman or lover, etc. should be treated special everyday not just on one day.

Late Night Edit: This is the fist time seeing this video, since it was pre-internet for me, and it never occurred to look up any till now . I've listened to the album since it came out, not sure what grade I was in, but I was 10 years old or maybe 11, so I've had a long time listening to The New Radical's "Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too" album (did I use quotes correctly?), I've mentioned it to you a long time ago, they're like one hit wonders, but mainly 'cause the singer did all the work. Any who, I saw the video, and noticed the guy to be very nerdy, and I do recall he has a set of short hair on one of the pictures of the album, so he must have shaved afterward. I listen to the album here and there, from time to time...maybe because it reminds me of when I was a kid, but I do like most songs and consider them one of my favorites, especially the album titled song; though the one on the video seems silly, I suppose a part of it was meant to be, there are no videos for the songs I mainly like. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91WgM6dNL...|`|cusngBDQaa	RiCK ASTLEY - NEVER GONNA GiVE YOU UP    http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu_moia-oV...

RQfLKOPQaa	The real punishment would be pressing charges, having her spend a day or two in jail, and learn that for every action there's a reaction. It doesn't necessary means that the police is the only solution, but that girl needs to learn that there's consequences, and a price to pay for her actions.  Of course I also think that maybe her upbringing wasn't strict enough. My daughter is only 19 months old, and the other she was pouting, and when I gave her my hand, she smacked it once, then I gave her my hand again and she smacked it again. Well I smacked her hand right back, and she just looked at her hand in disbelief, and when I gave her my hand again, she held it. I know kids are not supposed to be hit nowadays, but I still believe that, sometimes a good spanking in the butt is the best corrective. For a 20 year old to hit her mom is a clear sign of disrespect and lack of discipline. It would never occur to me to even think about it. She deserves a good spanking in the butt, the old fashioned way, maybe in front of all her friends? It makes me mad too.

65ae5dbf750c54c86214b6a8746d4b43aa	Vincent Sebastian sounds so cute!!!|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Benjamin Vincent McCarthy|`|9aac52bd187a4c3278570171778a711baa	vincent sebastian its unique|`|14gi4aTvaa	I like Vincent Thomas McCarthy [:  It's a nice name!|`|qsg8wCBiaa	okay. i voted :) uh. i think the benjamin vincent was cutest!|`|vXOreO4Uaa	I think Vincent Sebastian McCarthy.    I voted for it:)  It sounds very cool. It's also a very nice name.|`|cp7fjeJhaa	hi there,     i like vincent sebastian the best    best wishes to you!!|`|ZbZw82rOaa	Just drop your frying pan down the staircase.|`|AA12383908	Vincent Sebastian|`|khTuZrVsaa	name him Simba, that is a sick name|`|dlqa6yFkaa	I like Vincent Thomas the best and BTM are some pretty cool initials.    Vincent Sebastian doesn't roll of the tongue and I'm not a fan of Benjamin. Robert Thomas sounds too common.    Just my opinion for what it's worth.|`|lh6e1OiZaa	Vincent Sebastian is my favourite. It sounds like someone who would have a very strong character plus I love the name Sebastian :)|`|ef831d986a5932fbeb4aaba747db2c77aa	I like Robert. I voted.|`|HWyhc5rdaa	They all sound traditional  Vincent Thomas McCarthy  sounds good to me.  But does Vinny sound good to you?  Think of all the shortened "nicknames" that come with the first name as well.  Not to mention what warped things other children on the playground could come up with to pick on them rhyming with that.|`|Ci3Efibkaa	Lance. hands down|`|K6jB00yJaa	i love love love the name sebastian, i went with  1|`|TTnhPnohaa	1'st or 3'rd, im so happy for you!! i just think they sound right :)  CONGRATS!|`|e053d35694c9b45844ae2fafd8dc3ad4aa	I voted Benjamin Vincent as my favorite because Vincent is a nice name, but as a first name it seems a little outdated. I really like Benjamin and although it;s very well heard of, I don't find it that common.|`|yxofGMnTaa	i like Vincent Sebastian McCarthy best :)   good luck!!|`|XHRquczeaa	Benjamin Vincent McCarthy.|`|1SHwZDL1aa	Vincent Thomas  sounds lovely|`|wQiVfIciaa	I like Vincent Sebastian. It goes with your last name!            "VINCENT SEBASTIAN McCARTHY!"    Oh and Kudos!|`|b87482cd8013bcfad52b6cff60829a6eaa	Benjamin Vincent is my favorite I think.   But always remember you have to live with it and with my kids it was always obvious what the name was once I met the baby. It was instant and I know which of my "choices" was right. Good luck :D|`|PGfQNIOLaa	Well in my opinion i like  Vincent Thomas McCarthy because it has that certain ring to it,dont u think?..well good luck on choosin a name|`|AA11963397	i like vincent sebastian...|`|WFF4oQdmaa	you really have to think of what nickname you are most ok with.  becuase in the end your son will either be called    Vince, Rob, or Ben.  and personally i know a million rob's and bens.|`|ZGfmxs6Vaa	Vincent Thomas McCarthy    i loved this sound  of it|`|u3idZ9l9aa	i like Robert Thomas McCarthy cause its cute.  i have a friend Robbie Thomas :)
pszeAtFkaa	You are shallow.  Looks & being a "nerd" doesn't make you "worthy" or "unworthy".  I fell for my hubby because he was confident in who he was.  It is never a healthy relationship when one person feels like less than the other.  You know, nerds only exist in the small world of Jr. High & High School.  When you step out into the real world, many women see men for who they are...a "nerd" can be sweet or a jerk...same as a "popular" person.  I was very happy to find someone who enjoys reading, museums, etc....in High School that would make us nerds...however, we are quite happy with our lives.  Get some self confidence man.|`|2mCiqG3maa	nerds are cute!|`|fSRqz7aYaa	I'm pretty and I love nerds!!!    You do not have to be popular to catch the eye of a pretty girl.  If she has any sense at all, she would be looking at the quiet, unpopular guys because they are generally more decent, honest guys.|`|78d567ba4ef552df04b4e4bac0f97f4daa	you better get some confidence going on or you are gonna spend your weekends with a bottle of lube and porno. if you mean by being a nerd you are smart, then dress in today's style not like a geek and stop being a wuss. girls like guys with confidence. good luck|`|qVhqc019aa	I love nerdy guys...not saying Im beautiful, but I LOVE nerdy guys!    ?|`|Sw0yxyueaa	if you're gonna be like that, then you better make some big money, knucka.|`|kaaP8y2oaa	cuz you'll make the money eventually

But i dont see why people just look up the "resolved" or discover questions to already see the answers they want! Almost every question asked on here i bet has already been asked a long time before. ?mee|`|JaAM5KkBaa	yes people can be irritating when asking how much does it hurt ,   you take an old heroin addict thats done heroin for 30 years and doctors act like you cant have nothing for pain where in reality the old heroin addicts endorfins that kill pain are all dead and they feel pain worse than others , we cant measure pain from one person to the other we all have different pain receptors

UyfTZYATaa	Well,   I really liked the music well down with the multi tracker.  I like to be honest too and your singing was ok it wasnt horrible.  It was good but I think a different song would suit your voice type better.  Your accent just doesnt go with the song but your actual voice was good:)|`|y4Uliyq3aa	Your singing Is Ok.

zJX9wnKGaa	Good job...but you should take lessons to learn proper technique, at least as a basis. Once you have the basic things, you can alter it to fit your style if that's what you want to do.|`|keE8SLzOaa	U r good! i Ieft a comment on the first link!|`|8p7ZmllVaa	i honestly think that you can play. you should take lessons if you want to continue to pursue the piano and i think you will go far. but for someone who just plays to play, i think you are good|`|SmEueYApaa	Before you know whether you do well or bad, you should know how to measure greatness in piano.    I asked my grandma this, (she's a pianist, who worked with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and was a professor of music at Boston University)  I asked her what is a good pianist, and she said someone who plays the song how it was written, and plays it with energy. Brings energy to it.    To someone who doesn't know much about Piano, you would be WONDERFUL. To someone like my grandma you would be terrible.  But, for how I see it, you are mainly a singer and areusing it as accompaniment, and so for what it is, you are doing well. But if you plan on making this a "craft" and going professional then you have a long way to go. But you are doing well, so you've already come a long way.|`|NSBgGwSmaa	better then i could do|`|CVsJQxiJaa	you would do good on broadway|`|RTxFNURzaa	Ya your good|`|acf2c4c647ac5cade01d5fbace174430aa	you were playing 1,000 miles in the beginning.

I pretty face goes a long way|`|ij9N9r5waa	her Eyes, lips, smile then personality, sense of humor is major important,  then the girls confidence, we don't want a girl who has no self esteem,  we need her to need us, so even if she don't, she could act like it.|`|vZqYUZk1aa	first i dont like the word hot...it burns people  if you mean before i came to Jesus, her boobs and butt  today what i think it the best in a girl  her pesonality, bubbly, humor, kindness, i have gone out with a model, and a girl that is very over weight...both had good and bad qualities...its not about size of the body but of the heart  i like a girl who doesnt play games....not too hard to get, not easy, not wearing stuff that shows off her 'sexuality'  why get a girl that flaunts herself as hot, for other guys to google at, and to tempt you to dishonor her and ruin a relationship that would lead to marriage instead of disgrace and regret.

I need to try harder...do more...push myself...and that makes me anxious.
Itug9fNoaa	i actually tried this since you asked. if i put my chair all the way down, i can get most of the way under my desk, but, i've been working out and am kind of all muscle, so it made it impossible to get completely under there.   oh, and i did this without the help of vanilla vodka, lol|`|15b68e83c3ef9d01d0153600c96e7fe3aa	It would depend on several factors of course: Mainly the size of your body and the size of the space under your desk.    I can easily take both myself and my desk chair under my desk because (1) even though I'm 6' tall I weigh 180 and am agile for an old fart and (2) I've got a very large six foot wide desk.    If I weighed 250 and had a standard sized desk I could do so only in my dreams.|`|d59tk4B8aa	lol nope, this chair CANT roll its a recliner haha, it doesnt fit under it by itself|`|63VYa5k0aa	Ummmm......and I would want to do this because......why?

What do you mean?    EDIT: Oh, okay. lol. By the way, I asked because I thought you used the word 'hated' as in 'dislike to a powerful degree,' and I didn't think it sounded right. To correct you, hat as an adjective in that sense doesn't have to be said as 'hated,' but rather 'hat.'

rXMrlilAaa	Oh man, there have been books written about this.      Buy the Charlie Parker Omnibooks. it's a book of his transcribed solos.    and yes, its very hard to hit chord tones if the chords go by fast. but there's no secret to it, other than practice. Bird practiced 11-15 hours a day for 4 years.    other than the chord tones, Parker and Trane both utilize all 12 tones in their solos. as long as you hit the chord tones, it doesn't matter what notes you use to get to those notes.|`|MoKUZuQraa	First of all buy an omni-book it has all parker's solos in it on all the song he recorded. By playing form the omni-book you will get a better idea of how he hit the right notes to outline the changes as it also lists the chords. Listening to Parker and Trane is very important too. Tane did not always outline the changes as he got older for example in My Favorite Things there was not much for him to outline. All in all, you need to take it slow, get some aebersold books and put the background rythm section on and play up the chords 1-3-5-7 or whatever you need to do. When you feel like you know the notes of the chords. Then try improvising with good rhythm just using the important notes such as 3rds and 7ths. Just make sure you don't try and go right into soloing when you don't now a tune learn the chords first.    I hope this helps, remember practice makes perfect (well almost), and make sure your listening to a lot of jazz.|`|zpQ7gDlzaa	It sounds like you're already doing the most important thing by listening to their solos.  Try to transcribe one of your favorite solos if you can, then learn to play it - this will help you learn some of their licks.    Another trick is to sit down with some changes and write out the chord tones for every chord.  Then sit down and play them (to the beat).  This will help you get a feel for the notes in the chord.    One more thing: check out the book "Patterns for Jazz" by Jerry Coker.  It's got a lot of great exercises to work on chord changes.    Hope that helps! :-)|`|cddbc5ce032708ac06f5a70e27defe3faa	1st two answers are good!

I don't feel I need a site for people to visit. It would not be me in the grave. Just the human suit that I wore while I spent some time here. I don't get people who have gigantic headstones and all. If loved ones do it. ok. If the deceased plans it all ahead of time, I think it's silly. People will either remember you or not. A big head stone doesn't matter.

With A Little Help From My Friends    A little help from my friends  What would you think if I sang out of tune,  Would you stand up and walk out on me.  Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,  And I'll try not to sing out of key.  I get by with a little help from my friends,  I get high with a little help from my friends,  Going to try with a little help from my friends.  What do I do when my love is away.  (does it worry you to be alone)  How do I feel by the end of the day  (are you sad because you're on your own)  No I get by with a little help from my friends,  Do you need anybody,  I need somebody to love.  Could it be anybody  I want somebody to love.  Would you believe in a love at first sight,  Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time.  What do you see when you turn out the light,  I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.  Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,  Do you need anybody,  I just need someone to love,  Could it be anybody,  I want somebody to love.  I get by with a little help from my friends,  Yes I get by with a little help from my friends,  With a little help from my friends.  Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds    Picture yourself in a boat on a river,  With tangerine trees and marmalade skies  Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,  A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.  Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,  Towering over your head.  Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,  And she's gone.  Lucy in the sky with diamonds.  Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain  Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,  Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,  That grow so incredibly high.  Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,  Waiting to take you away.  Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,  And you're gone.  Lucy in the sky with diamonds,  Picture yourself on a train in a station,  With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,  Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,  The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.  Getting Better    It's getting better all the time  I used to get mad at my school  The teachers who taught me weren't cool  You're holding me down, turning me round  Filling me up with your rules.  I've got to admit it's getting better  A little better all the time  I have to admit it's getting better  It's getting better since you've been mine.  Me used to be a angry young man  Me hiding me head in the sand  You gave me the word  I finally heard  I'm doing the best that I can.  I've got to admit it's getting better  I used to be cruel to my woman  I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved  Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene  And I'm doing the best that I can.  I admit it's getting better  A little better all the time  Yes I admit it's getting better  It's getting better since you've been mine|`|QNObnVODaa	Beaten again.Bugger!

According to Vedic scriptures, every human being is a "Parth"|`|ReWvRGwOaa	i think that most 'words' on that site is fake.  very distgusting that my name to someone means 'the epitome of a *** dumpster' or 'when a squirrel has buttsex with a frog' or 'A female child molester.

CIUAIxXaaa	Yes, Oh oh Lanta. I really hate that. Like, this boy who has a crush on me(he is like really nerdy) was flirting with me and telling everybody I am his girl...It was pretty embarassing because people actually beleived it. The guy the I used to like, didn't want to date me(he was gonna go to the dance with me) because he though I already had a boyfried...haHa..so sad=[|`|eLcqraD4aa	i know  that is so mean   you shud stand up for urself and tell him the truth  i wish u the best of luck     cheer up :( changed to :)|`|AA11518036	Yes l do.

What's worse, it happened while I was in a relationship. I kept telling them that I was just friends with the guy, but they wouldn't ******* listen. So my boyfriend thought I was cheating on him. He eventually believed me though, and apologized for listening to them. Still, the whole thing pissed me off.|`|OI29tkSoaa	That has not happen to me but it does not sound like a good thing just tell the guy you like that you are not taken by any one.|`|UwFb8cleaa	what school do you go to?|`|OxaonF5aaa	Yeah, once this girl faked a relationship.|`|8c3z5jVtaa	why don't you just un claim it? lol.  and nope, never happened to me.|`|fSRqz7aYaa	Hasn't really happened to me...|`|amWXAck6aa	yes I do.|`|Okes2LCuaa	never happened to me.|`|90MSfEGSaa	yes|`|AA10302607	No never happened.

XUe07RPGaa	As I've got older, Family Guy. But I do still enjoy watching the Simpsons, but no-where near as much as I used to.  I suppose I like Family Guy more because it's newer- dare I say it, the Simpsons now may be coming to the end of its lifespan, therefore it becomes a bit boring after a while. Saying that, Family Guy has been said to be the plagiariser of the Simpsons- and in some episodes you can really tell a bit of borrowing has occured!  And to be honest, Family Guy can be easier to watch- it's a lot more funny in an easy way (?) The Simpsons is clever by using a lot of wit and double entendres, so it is appropriate for a younger audience but yet appealing to older audiences too. Family guy is easy to watch before going to bed- not much thinking involved!|`|XZXV6RD8aa	Neither!!    KA|`|TMnJJgS8aa	Family Guy....     coz that show is so funny, lol.|`|gRW5X4vZaa	Simpsons.. why? Because nothing else in america can top it. People who really know funny watch the simpsons... family guy is just making it's breakthrough.. Simpsons is on there 20th year.--- i mean, look at all of the guest stars they've had one their.. how many of them would really want to go on family guy      I guess in the end it really depends on your type of humor  Intelligent humor= simpsons  Crude and pathetic humor= family guy|`|cgqgomawaa	Family guy. Giggity giggity goo.    Don't get me wrong i am partial to a bit of the simpsons but i just love the humour in fam guy|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	Family Guy! I love how random it is!|`|73e3f871852c0aa4be6e14a32580488faa	Simpson's is Original, and Family Guy tends to steal their ideas and slightly change them to fit their show.  BUT FAMILY GUY IS FUNNIER|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	I like them both but I think that Family guy has the edge and that is just because Stewie is so funny|`|32c5a26e00e77bac07f6445e8dafc461aa	fam guy|`|JOAPnhOgaa	i don't like them at all|`|9ZiIvhRdaa	definitely, Family Guy|`|106uKaEYaa	Simpsons.|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	Simpsons because it is way more intelligent and funnier than family guy|`|zrRx8UvWaa	Family Guy... STEWIE!!!|`|6dRBJUnraa	i honestly cant choose they are both brilliant and funny|`|cW2ypuXBaa	simpsons,  its not as rude lol|`|ilftGfhMaa	I've always felt that Family Guy is like The Simpsons, but for an older audience.    The Simpsons are meant to be enjoyed by all audiences, but Family Guy is more specifically marketed towards teenagers and young adults.    I personally would say that I enjoy Family Guy more.|`|WQzi3agEaa	Simpsons. Since season 11 it has gone extremely downhill, but its golden years were some of the best TV ever. I respect Family Guy as it has some great moments, but I think it got some of its inspiration from the Simpsons, and will never surpass it in terms of lasting impact. The Simpsons has given society so much, and is the father of cartoons. Its characters are recognisable worldwide, and caters for a much more complete audience (ie all of society) compared to Family Guy.|`|xk5movogaa	south park beats them all|`|ByktJQpOaa	Family Guy - Stewie, for his extreme matricidal tendencies and he's obviously a theatre lover...if you get my drift!!|`|szX4WyfJaa	Family Guy.    It's funnier by far.|`|CPZA5qrGaa	The Family Guy Peter is soooooooooooo annoying, so annoying, so annoying, so annoying, so annoying, so annoying, so annoying,   heh! heh! heh! heh! heh! heh! heh! heh! heh! heh! heh! heh!   Aw! come on, pull my finger, pull my finger, pull my finger.  I can't stand that show.    The Simpsons I can tolerate. I try to tune in when I'm able.  All the characters are hilarious. Not one in particular, all of them are hilarious.   The Simpsons are the Super Bowl Champions of animation today.  And they're still going strong.|`|9Pyx97uBaa	Family Guy.

If you did have a mobile that would be use full.  If not, the three thing I would have with me, (apart from mobile), would be water for obvious reasons, something to strike a light like a match to ignite any wreckage to start a smoke signal.  And something (just about anything) large enough to keep me out of the sun and prevent burns and chance of dehydration and heat stroke.    So that's, water, matches, large object for shade.
nOUY9MOWaa	That was to much for me. I had a hard time enjoying the movie after that scene.The original script was alot better before George Lucas changed it.|`|Jvmuri5naa	Films are for you to enjoy, not question. My brother is guilty of the same thing you are doing. Why don't you just enjoy the film?    I agree it was pretty awful, not the best Indiana Jones film, but hey, nobody's perfect!|`|b85499a57edbf5a1f37bce5ce90c8557aa	it was a bad, bad movie.  pity.|`|Y31Ci8vlaa	Movies are creative and i do not agree with you.|`|IiB6nXn5aa	Yes I agree. Parts of this last script did not live up to the standards of the others.|`|BEPFzpcXaa	I do not watch silly movies  (until they come out on DVD and I'm having a silly day).    -  So, I didn't see the movie yet, but if he were close enough to the blast, the fridge would have melted or evaporated from the heat.  -|`|Mp0MTuvDaa	damn yes    but it is indiana    i dont recommend you try it|`|zs38LPu4aa	it was a little far fetched but then again, the others required a little suspension of disbelief.    Besides, he was thrown clear by the blast so rather than being irradiated he should have had just about every bone in his body turned to powder.  It would have been a short movie though if they killed of the main guy in the first half hour|`|jEYAZltzaa	It would make sence about the firdge but i think the movie all together was abit bad compared to the others.    Indiana jones was about myths and legends,plans and traps, history and archeology.    Then in this film...ALIENS!?!? WTF!?  Abit farfeched for a Indiana Jones movie if u ask me.  Previous films were alot better, a lil more realistic.

4MSHM3ydaa	well, you kinda already gave your own answer. all you need is a little inspiration. XD. so just imagine yourself with your bf on the beach or somthing. or better yet go there! somtimes its kinda better to theme yourself self, it can somtimes help too. if you need anymore help, contact me, cause im kinda writing a book my self, and i might need a good poem XD|`|GizsyPAkaa	I'm just a closet-amateur poet, but here's my two-cents:    As long as the poem appeals to your feelings, as long as it moves you, it's a beautiful poem. Don't aim to get praise, Write from the Heart, for yourself.    If that's how you feel about your boyfriend, write about it.  Don't mind the meanies here!|`|5YTkGB5yaa	If you're old enough have a glass of wine and give it a try. That'll relax you and open your mind up a bit.|`|WyaWCz2aaa	wow that was really good, i dont really have any tips sorry...    but it was really good, my gf wrote a poem about me and she gave it to me and it was fairly awesome, made me feel special.  nice work!  i'm sure he is a good guy for you, you are probably just underestimating yourself...    sorry its kind of a crap answer, im fairly tired.  good poem though|`|mqcVaxMvaa	no one cares about your boyfriend, write something else.|`|nzuKwXWbaa	I think you just need to give it some time.  Don't rush it.  Poetry comes from the heart and is meant to show what your feeling.  The poem that you wrote was a poem.  There is no other way to put it.  I can't relate to it but it may touch someone else.  Keep up the writing.  It will come easier and easier.

HJnk5zjyaa	I would say the steel string acoustic would give a better sound than the nylon string classical.  Heres why:  1. Steel string acoustics have small neck width,  which brings the strings closer together, so when you strum it there is less sound separation between the strings than a classical.   2. A classical guitar will never be able to produce the amount of volume a Dreadnought acoustic guitar can.  Even if you strum hard enough on a classical the sounds will get distorted because the bracing on the classical are much much lighter and weaker than a steel string guitar.  The classical is for a more intimate type of playing, but the dreadnought is for smackin down.|`|FCFdYuchaa	confirm  http://guitar-classic-guide.blogspot.com|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	The classical guitar has a wider neck.  It also has nylon strings.  It is meant to be finger picked (and strummed).  A standard accoustic guitar is meant more for strumming and picking.  The neck is thinner and the strings are metal (brass usually).  It can be finger-picked or used with a pick.

cgb4WOnVaa	Yeah.. especially when the asker says something smarta$$ed in response to my answer - and follows that up by blocking me before I can get a retort in.|`|7aisLVeiaa	Yes. Then I get irritated because I wasted my breath on a moron.|`|FnxgmknUaa	Ive never had that happen i dont think... What sorts of questions do you mean exactly?|`|TTnhPnohaa	yeah and then i feel really sad b/c i tried :( im very gullible|`|zI6cZoAWaa	i have never encountered this situation
FZKFLTyLaa	I have not.  Thanks for the warning.
cMW27bQxaa	of course not. thats like eating one kind of food for the rest of your life, and even though your committed to this food, you still like the smell or the looks of other foods.    the only time id get mad is if they actually ate this other food.|`|LeX9Z7jjaa	No.. It's perfectly natural to be attracted to more than one person. If you asked me if I would be upset if he ACTED on his attraction, then absolutely.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	No it's human nature to find more than 1 person attractive. If she does something about her attraction to someone else then I would be upset.|`|aaQUMXUzaa	I think everyone, male and female is attracted to others, but as long as they don't act on it.................|`|TbW8hD4Haa	yeah of course, relationships are about commitment.|`|LoRgAmc6aa	Oh yes I would!|`|7aisLVeiaa	Yes. If he really cared about me and loved me, he wouldn't want anybody else.|`|jkkatZfBaa	very upset but I know it won't happen (he's old school and happy)|`|OJAC44eTaa	yes, if he talked about her and went on and on, or actually cheated on me with her.|`|xMvt8KhEaa	no, attraction is natural . i would be upset if that person acted on the attraction|`|3956c292d9898cc425bc25b7923184b7aa	No.  It's impossible to live life and never be attracted to more than one person.|`|Jm6mkvlWaa	Yes. I am an extremely jealous person and I would feel betrayed.  Now, if its like an actress that he thinks is hot, it would bother me, but wouldn't be near as bad as him being attracted to someone he actually knows and comes in contact with.    But.. yeah. I would be pissed.|`|y8wOnto7aa	Its alright for him to think oh that women is beautiful but if he like has more than a attraction to her then yes when your in a relationship you make a commitment. i'd be very upset|`|vmlArXqAaa	well if he told me about it i would take it that he didn't like me anymore so i would probably break it off.|`|UcezPQcjaa	I would raise hell, like this video, start it at 0:25  and end it at 1:02    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKgxdb4jg...
1uSoU8Lpaa	YES! That show was one of the best Sci-Fi shows ever made, could be the best along with the one I mentioned below. It's unfair that shows like that get the ax and lame shows (just about every other one) go on and on and on.  Check out Invasion if you can KZ. It was a one season Sci-Fi show in 2005-2006 and was really good too. Another show way too good to get the ax. But seriously-it's worth it to watch it!|`|MLzYUzjmaa	re-runs at like 4am i watch if im up|`|3MFsPmnaaa	Never heard of it before.

9o9UigBaaa	cuz they are idiots|`|e654790b992c67caf75978a2190563b1aa	They're too nervous, scared, drunk, or high to think clearly...    so I guess somewhere within the second they notice the police they believe that they just might get away.     I'm surprised that 30% actually get away... I didn't know that.     ^_^|`|QLkxGjFraa	lol they run cuz they think they have a chance|`|0Nyry3rZaa	They want to be on "Disorderly Conduct"|`|9vOBtO1Oaa	The thrill of the chase, hon...just as it seems with men and women!

However they are entertaining to watch! For me anyway. I saw one today, like around 5. Some girl drove a UHAUL for two hours. Tried to run and get in someone elses car! :)|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	I guess it's because they were desperate and too blinded with trying to get away then to realize they have little or no chances to getting away.|`|VoKzvoxKaa	lol i no i was watching one today about a woman and she finally ran out of gas. it was on KTLA|`|V4JLwTVyaa	Because no one thinks ahead.    1) Plan your escape route ahead of time.  Know when and where areas of high traffic and construction are.    2) Make it interesting.  Do you know how bored the police can get with a simple, ordinary chase?  Add some water balloons filled with paint (for windshields), caltrops or twisted nails (for tires), and, if you can get your hands on them, a smoke grenade in a tunnel is always good.  And who can resist an ol' fashioned oil slick?  3) Pick the right car for the job.  Are you planning on a highway, offroad, or city escape? Also, make sure the vehicle is up to the abuse; it's no good having a brilliant plan if your radiator is about to blow or if you need new brakes.  4) Change your cars.  Have another getaway vehicle ready to go at a predetermined point.  If everyone is looking for an unmarked blue van, then no one is looking for a motorcycle or a VW Beetle.  5) Chases are not about speed, but about maneuverability. Yes, you do want to get away fast, but how well can you turn while doing 100 mph?  And it's much easier to avoid spike strips when you have more than a half second to react to them.  6) Always try to sideswipe a fruit cart or crates full of chickens.  And if you see two guys moving a pane of glass across the street, man, just go for it.|`|OPNReaAaaa	lol because they think if they try hard enough they will..but obviously they arent thinking|`|SVZDMnTMaa	They do it for the thrill of it|`|pszeAtFkaa	They think they are special...LOL.  I just hate that the news follows it like it is breaking news...to us here in LA, it's as common as earthquakes.|`|HCHqzkQraa	Because, they don't take into consideration that they might kill an Innocent child or person (that happens way too often)  and most likely should not be driving any way, that is why they are trying to flee.|`|OI29tkSoaa	Because it is a Thrill to run away and gamble taking a chance and wondering What if I do get away|`|L4Ky6SCqaa	That one last chance!|`|iIWWeD7Taa	The trick is getting away at the beginning.  Go on foot at the beginning of the chase, not at the end.  You have a better chance at outrunning one or two cops than you do at outrunning 25 cops, the chopper, the News-3 van and CNN.|`|qS4EG5qYaa	ther stupid|`|90MSfEGSaa	i know alot of people that get away

3QqLYCJCaa	This question has been around forever.  People will never agree.  Personally, I believe life starts at conception.    Abortion is murder.    It's not my job to judge anyone, though.  I'll let God handle that.|`|69SHxWA9aa	Hi,    Before I started to read the Bible, I was thinking along the lines as a lot of people.      If I want to play my music loud, and you can not hear it - and it does not effect anyone outside my house, then why are you meddling in my business?    Afterall if it is not effecting your life, why are you bothering mine?    Why should a personal decision that I make be controlled by your beliefs in the Bible?    So I used to think that an abortion was a Woman's right to decide to do this or not do this.      Like wearing a helmet is a great idea, so are seatbelts.  A law that says kids must wear a helmet or a seatbelt - I am OK with that too.  But for an adult to fear getting a ticket and put on a seatbelt to drive his car from one parking spot to another is ridiculous.      Well if you have read the Bible, then you should consider pre-marital sex as a sin, and abortions as killing what we think of as a life.      But if you don't care about the Bible, then do what you want.  Don't worry about eternal judgment.     What is better?    Well we have known how to prevent unwanted pregnancies for over 100 years, and I would think that would allow us to avoid having abortions for that long of a time.  However they have become increasingly a option considered by many.    Why?    There are hundreds of reasons like:    Well I ran out of condoms and thought it would be OK this time.    Well I thought that I could not get pregnant at 14.    Well I thought that it would be fun to bring a kid of my own to the high school football games.    There are a lot of reasons why teens end up pregnant.  Many of them are not in a stable married relationship before getting pregnant.      Why?    I have no idea why they don't buy enough condoms, buy birth control pills, and what is required.    I hope that you can make it to marriage before getting pregnant, it is not really that difficult.  What is difficult is finding out that your boyfriend that you think of as someone who will support you through thick and thin all of the sudden decides that going to college and partying is more fun than being Mr. Dad full time, and he is not going to have a great job, but is stuck being a dad.  He might decide to leave you in your time of need.    While it takes to to tango, who is responsible for getting pregnant?    While a woman can not get pregnant without a man, the man needs to be careful too, or face years of child support.  The woman can control getting pregnant.  By taking birth control pills, or say no when there are not any more condoms around.  The man can also say no when there are not any condoms around, and also say no to sex before making a life long commitment too.    You bring up a simple question with very complicated answers, and I think that abortions should not be done, however is it my right to say that every woman can not have one because of what I think it right in God's Eyes?    It says in the Bible that if you see a person that is sinning, you are to let them know that they are committing a sin against what is written.  If they change their minds, and commit to not doing that sin over and over, then that is acceptable.  But if they continue to sin, then they are saying that they want to reject the parts of the Bible that do not conform to their worldly ways, and want to continue to live in the ways of the world, not the way of the Bible.    It is fine with me if you live by worldly ways, yet I will be happy to know that more people have decided to live by the rules set forth in the Bible.  It even says that the wide path will be traveled by many, while the straight and narrow is traeled by few.    Good Luck!|`|lg2RfcrQaa	If the reason for their abortion is because they don't have enough money/stable home/job and what have you to raise a child then I think NO. They should not have a choice. If you're selfish enough to create a life because of your stupidity, you can do something good and give the baby up for adoption.    If however, the baby has a serious illness where it basically won't even be able to look after itself, I think abortion is ok.    I've just read your question again but I'm not quite sure what you're trying to get a.t People DO have the option.|`|clqgFUFFaa	..I think is an abomination|`|sDHxandWaa	I think that unless there's a medical problem or a case of rape, then no. I don't think abortion is the answer just because two people decided to have unsafe sex even though they knew a baby could happen.|`|sfBKFSEfaa	Are you just trying to start a shtstorm or what?|`|U8WJieKHaa	murderers|`|ri4Y9Lmbaa	Yes, when I woman's right to her own body is taken away we will truly be oppressed.|`|aotINbL3aa	i dont agree, but if it happens. it happens.|`|gIMZaY02aa	Self is the most important thing in life, if someone is incapable/unwilling to care for a child they should certainly have the choice to abort.  Period.    It's hilarious that this is still even debated.|`|WFF4oQdmaa	people should have freedoms.  freedoms include the freedom to make their own choices. whether we like them or not, what a person does with their own body is their business.     im pro-life for myself, but pro-choice for the women of the world.|`|yxofGMnTaa	me too. even though i would never do it personally, there are some people or some environments that are just not fit for raising a baby in, and if the people take the responsibility to accept that (yes i realize having responsibility would really be not getting pregnant in the first place) at least they won't be hurting the child's life.   and yes i also realize there is adoption, but people should still have the choice.|`|XzsvBhJWaa	Yes, of course. The option has to remain legal and available in a professional medical setting, because there are always situations where abortion is medically required, and there are always people who will desire abortion one way or another, regardless of possible moral/religious/legal/etc considerations. The alternatives (back alley abortions,) make laws regarding abortion a necessity.    On a more personal level, I believe that everyone has the right to decide what is best for their own bodies. A fetus is a part of the mother's body, thus it is her jurisdiction. Outside opinions shouldn't hold any weight.
1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	Well, all the sequals have been straight to dvd. There might be one or two more, im sure as long as the people who keep putting them out keep making money, they'll continue to make them.    First one is the greatest though, by faaaaaaar.

a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	The album "Kill Em All (1983)" by Metallica was innovative for its time.  If Metallica were to release the album today, it would NOT have the impact it did back in 1983.  This is because no heavy metal album existed back in 1983 that was both as fast and as intricate as Kill 'Em All.    Kill 'Em All has an obvious Diamond Head influence, as well as a heavy Motorhead influence, but Motorhead didn't do the kinds of changes (songs with a few different sub-parts) that we find on Kill 'Em All.  The heavy riffing style on Kill 'Em All goes all the way back to "In Rock (1970)" by Deep Purple, and "Master of Reality (1971)" by Black Sabbath.      Kill 'Em All is a synthesis of early Motorhead and Diamond Head.  Notice that Metallica drops this style, this more punk-rock style, by "Master of Puppets (1986)."  Slayer even shed the style by "Reign in Blood (1986)."  The last album that has the Kill 'Em All style is "Feel the Fire (1984)" by Overkill.      Metal began to divorce itself from the punk rock styled NWOBHM movement aroun 1984, and pursue a more sober, thoughtful, progressive attitude.  Albums like "Rust in Peace (1990)" by Megadeth and "In the Shadows (1993)" by Mercyful Fate are early Progressive Metal albums.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Metallica is the best Metal band of the 80's, my fav of all time, I think it would be apreciated because they are a classic!    Metallica is far from sold out, and I would imagine they are a different band considering there age. James Hetfield is a legend that will never die.|`|e9Q51Oxyaa	Next to Death Magnetic? it'd be a gift from god herself|`|HrsPCzaBaa	It is appreciated as the album it was when it came out originally.   Metallica was a great thrash band, and has completely sold out.   They've lost their anger, aggression, and passion that made them what the were in the 80's. They are a compeltely different band now.|`|qh9Pa1tVaa	Metallica is only good for 80' and 90'. now their cheaper than last decade!

I swear...i haven't seen him since that dream...but i was so overjoyed when i woke up...i still remember that dream vividly....|`|7IAdgdzWaa	Unfortunately i have dreams that come true but they are always about any family member's illness, the worst one lately, a strange dream of dad , two days before his heart stroke|`|vmlArXqAaa	well, if it counts every time i think of a movie or an episode of a show or a song randomly that i want to watch it usually comes on tv or the radio within the next few days. its so weird.|`|YpNZN5nqaa	i had a dream once that i would meet a guy at the movies and he would make me write down his number and i wouldnt remember his name, but we would end up togeather.    and then the next day i met roland at the movies, and he made me write down my screen name and we ended up dating for a month.     its really similar and it was ******* CREEPY. i was thinking of not giving him my sn because of the dream, but then i thought, if i dreamt it, then it might have to come true. lol
AA10565295	Sing la on a pentascale. Then go up a half step and do the same thing. Over and over.    There's also sirens. You just go HAWWW like a crow or something (without the growling). Maybe see if you can find a video of it. Hard to explain but easy to do.|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	Start with a triad on the piano.  Work your way up until your voice is ready to crack.  Then work your way back down.  Repeat as often as necessary.|`|3ozaCLYqaa	ok, what I'm about to suggest is gonna sound stupid and pointless, but the difference in sound quality from before doing the following exercises to after is incredible.      1. Stand behind a chair with your hands placed on the back.  Start singing up and down the scale as you press down as hard as you can (without breaking the back of the chair, of course ;]).  Be sure to keep your arms as straight as possible and stay as tall and lifted as possible. BREATH FROM YOUR DIAPHRAGM -  this is sooooo important while doing this exercise.  You should feel a great deal of pressure in your lower abdominal muscles, aprox. in the area where the zipper of your jeans would be.  Your stomach should be expanding and your shoulders should not move at all.  After practicing this for a while, you should feel stronger when you sing and your breath support should improve a lot.    2. This one is super easy and it makes a huge difference.  If you start singing and you notice that you sound a little tight, it just means that you need to lift your soft pallet.  This can be done by placing your tongue on the roof of your mouth (as far back as possible) and then rapidly raising and lowering your lower jaw.  Try not to move your upper jaw at all.  You should feel a stretching sensation near the back of your throat.  When I do this, it almost feels as though it gets very cold right in the back of my mouth, but everyone is different.     3.  Try laying on the floor as you sing.  This will help a ton with your breathing.  This is a great exercise to do if you are preparing a piece that has a note that you have to hold for a very long time and you just can't seem to do it.  Sing the song while laying on the ground, and I guarantee that you will be able to.  It is important to keep the same good posture that you would have if you were standing, i.e, feet shoulder-width apart, arms at side, etc.      4.  You can add more energy to your sound if you bounce up and down on the front flat part of your foot while singing.      5. Try singing your songs on just the vowels.

And then he goes to me "you are asleep" and I'm like "no, I'm waiting for a sticker there's nothing else I can do" and he just kept like saying "you're asleep" "what are you doing?" He was a real jack *** to say the least. Even the people after him, when he left were like what the hell is his problem.

oW2UQMRCaa	Most likely no, because whether or not they'll admit it eventually one will develop feelings for the other, and either will be very good at keeping it a secret. I bet some of these girls answering yes are best friends with a guy who probably has a crush on them and they aren't even aware of it. Gay guys don't count. Then, again anything is possible...right?|`|suojKPfPaa	I have a good number of guy friends, and after hearing half the things they tell me, I would never be able to look at them the same ever again! lol They treat me like one of the guys, and to be honest, I appreciate it.

x0J8S5sWaa	Music has taught me that just like music, many different types of people, religions, opinions and forms of art can be interesting.    When I was a little kid I used to only listen to pop music. Nowadays I like many forms of rap, country, rock and classical. So I've learned to appreciate variety. The only one I sitll don't enjoy is hard rock or metal....:)|`|ox4MdqcVaa	If you work hard at something you will get better.     Creativity and uniqueness is a good thing, contrary to popular belief.     Everyone's good at something.|`|LIyqb5Rwaa	Practice makes perfect.    The harder something is to acheive, the more rewarding it usually is.    Everybody sucks at everything the first time we try it.|`|7kvTHzj0aa	nothing really. anything you learn in music is meant to be applied to music. ive been playing piano for 10 years, alto sax for 8 years, tenor sax for 5 years, guitar for 3 years, cello for 2 and i make my own techno music for fun. all the music theory i learned never helped me in real life except in music related situations.

AA11536708	If someone is seriously at peace wit themselves, they have no need to brag.    Bragging only shows that you feel the need to do it because you are insecure.    Tons of pictures does not necessarily mean the same thing, however.  You might just post pictures of your life because you want to share your experiences with friends.  That's different than bragging.|`|fSRqz7aYaa	Human nature.    We're all narcissists, or hopelessly in love with ourselves, even though we think we hate ourselves.|`|c1XvN0BVaa	Yes, 100% That is simply what MySpace is about. It encourages this type of behavior and mentality. I don't do MySpace because I like my privacy. Everyone just wants their 15 minutes of fame, I guess.|`|xz98PNLEaa	Yes I guess so but I would also like to see their friends pictures and have them brag about that person.  But it is good to love yourself first.|`|kN31jvVaaa	I love myself, but only to a degree.  I am not some annoying broski who just brags about his bulging biceps and hwo many chicks he picks up.  So no, I don't agree.  People should love themselves, but not to the degree that many of them do.|`|EAt1rB8naa	sometimes it can be good but the truth is most of the time those people are the ones that nobody really wants to see their picture,, they have enough arrogance for 10 people|`|i6RlYFo7aa	i think  its good, BUT its gross when ugly people are really into themselves on myspace and post pics of themselves trying to be sexy

CesOQMdeaa	I don't think that it is sold out  but it might be hard getting tickets for it now  You may have to collect your tickets at the door if you buy them now  If you can't order them now or they have sold out you might be able to find someone at the venue selling tickets   there always is somebody selling them, but it's not always best to buy tickets from them :/    xo|`|Dr2JjGIfaa	Not 2 sure if there entirely sold out, but one way you could double check is to ring the venues box office and double check to see if they are any available tickets for tonights show (:    or,    you can go grab one off the touts (: (advice, if you get there and can't find ne tiks going, make sure you can get home easily (:|`|whfbEPPeaa	According to the O2 Academy website tickets are all sold out through Ticketweb.

You see, for me it's the other way around. However, you are lucky to actually have guys your age that would go out with you! Any girl shorter than me is practically 10 years old!    So I kind of have no choice but to date a taller girl.     Just remember that someone else living in Queensland feels your pain.|`|kN31jvVaaa	The same height, but not taller.

I used to be pretty self concise about it, but it isn't something I can change, so you just have to let it go.

LOpQsKysaa	Love it...it's funny and not offensive to me.  My gay friends love recognition, in any venue, as long as it's positive or in jest.  I've heard worse, from gay comedians/emcees in gay cabaret bars.  Their motto is: if you can't laugh at yourself, then you can't laugh at anyone else.  Have a great day and keep on chuckling.|`|uzXwM0Qzaa	Haha, good joke!!!!|`|cxnrP97taa	and ur point is what exactly?????????????????????????|`|AA10811426	This is an old joke.

w4LKvr0daa	It's our bodies primal response to arousal.

r8s5j6zOaa	Jews, Indians and African Americans|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	I dunno. There are many different groups that suffered so much. But since the early recorded history, the group that continuously was persecuted, suffered, enslaved, and  sacked well into the 20th century was the Jewish.    And I'm not Jewish, I just know history.    My final answer is, people that suffered throughout the history, whether they were persecuted because they seemed different, weak, evil... they were all freaking people. They were human beings, and all the groups of people in this question all have one thing in common. They all killed other people of different race, color, and culture. So, what people suffered more? All of them. At some point and time in history, they all caused suffering on other people.     Oh god, I'm getting too philosophical again. I'm a f*cking d0uche.    Don't mind me, I was rambling again.|`|clqgFUFFaa	Christians|`|6380221dbceb0381d89b54bd786e9f42aa	Native Americans|`|ew5uqfdpaa	Ancient Greeks, Romans, Lycans, Vikings.

AA10569146	There was Vinnie Vincent as the Ankh and Eric Carr as the Hawk    Edit- While Vinnie Vincent and Eric Carr were in Kiss, Kiss decided in the early 80s to go sans make up. Plus the 4 original that you mentioned are what Kiss fans remember and hold dear to their hearts. The original band members reunited and decided to put back on the make up and go on tour. It was a huge commercial success. When Ace and Peter wanted more money they were kicked out and replaced by Eric Singer as the Cat Man and Tommy Thayer (formally of Black and Blue) as Space Ace. To have Tommy Thayer be dressed up as The Ankh would be stupid.Plus the band, when they first decided to take off the make up,knowing that they are now rotating band members didnt want to keep coming up with personas for the new members.    After Vinnie Vincent left the band he was replaced by Mark St. John who only performed on one album, Animalized but was kicked out because Gene did not like him. (He was told to say he had arthritis and couldnt play but that was not the truth) He was replaced by Bruce Kulick.    Eric Carr passed away in 1991 due to Heart cancer and was replaced by Eric Singer|`|cVqCryr6aa	This is such a waste of time. The band blows, and Gene is an oversized boil.|`|oOSNI3wbaa	actually it was the wizard (vincent) and the fox (carr)|`|XhJuHMwQaa	A Fox (Carr) and a Sphinx (Vincent).    Ace and Peter quit Kiss by their own choice.  Ace didn't like the direction Kiss going.  He wanted Kiss to be more of a guitar driven band and he also was ready to stop wearing make up and costumes.  Peter quit Kiss because of the harm it was doing to his family life.  He didn't want to loose his wife.|`|AA12371739	Originally Paul was supposed to be the Lone Ranger but due to trademark issues they could not use it.  See the cover of an album called Kiss My *** a collection of covers of Kiss Songs the cove shows the Demon, the Starchild, the Cat and the Lone Ranger.

UMNJJdsAaa	Hi fake Boxxy|`|m3ThrbDMaa	Because success in our society is based upon superficial things...|`|rrN9qhfbaa	Not all girls are superficial, but a lot are. They may believe that they can greatly succeed in society by being superficial. Everyday you see models in the media that look beautiful and whatever, so women are pressured into always trying to look better because they may be self-conscious about the way they look, which is often brought on by celebrities and whatever. People always want to be accepted so may conform differently to who they really are...   Wasn't sure what the question meant so I hope I answered it right :-)|`|BgIithGWaa	You are generalizing. You can't say "girls today" because that implies that every girl is the same. Which we are not. Therefore your question is a silly pile of poop. That may have been immature but it's still true. I really hate when people say things like that! It's as bad as being racist, because you lump a category together and give them all the same label. Poop!

You should really work on your pattern and do more multi rhymes, it takes more to write good lyrics than just rhyming a few words, I do like that you was writing from your heart, or at least it seems that way to me, you may not be a lyricist but sometimes just writing something down helps get it off your mind. anyway sounds like you're going threw a breakup so best of luck in that and keep practicing.|`|jonDL0J5aa	its good, but not that good :D

I know to some people it's like "killing a baby." But seriously, think about it, you're ONLY 14, a minor, you're not capable to taking care of a baby. You're a kid your self. Enjoy your life. You can be a full time mommy when you're older. But as for now, a baby can mess up your entire life and studies at school. You'll end up as one of those bums on the streets.     I advise you take think carefully before you decide to keep the baby. It's a huge step.|`|8a7c02df359d96db8ffa457a92b75e50aa	You should tell your parents or else they'll find out the hard way.

Everything happens for a reason, and this is a God-given gift. Better take care with it.     Keep it healthy and safe. God bless you...|`|WtDga0Quaa	Well first tel ur paarents next go see a doctor about how the baby is doing and next DON'T ABORT!!!! Keep it and let the pregnancy take its course have the baby and either keep it or give it to a couple hu want a baby and can support it and love it k but dont worry and if u wanna finish skool early go to options for youth so ur friends dont have to make bad comments about u but pleez tell ur parents k goodluck|`|TKl5hnv3aa	You know, I'm sorry.

And they are buying baby supplies. How is it that they didn't tell your parents you are pregnant. It don't make sense. I know if my minor child got pregnant or got someone pregnant me and the parents will have a long talk. Cuz neither is ready for a child.|`|xv7lOjzXaa	All you need to do is tell you parentrs . Suure they with be mad at first but it wasnt your fault. I dont agree with adoption or abortion wither so i am with you girl. Your parents will understand. You must be very stressed right now. Tell your parents. They will understand. They may be a little bit disapointed at you and there will be some yelling but you wil get through this. Good for you for wanting to finish school.  Good Luck!

521978f4254c4b8f2b7244300239e951aa	Romeo from "Romeo and Juliet" was Juliet's lover, but an enemy of her parents, so Swift is implying that seeing this boy she refers to as "Romeo" is forbidden.  Being "a scarlet letter" implies having sin, which may refer to Swift's desire for her forbidden lover.  Basically the song "Love Story" is about forbidden young love.|`|VEHzqU8Jaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scarlet...

4bFypdGLaa	Well I'm starting to dislike it these days. It's just that Naruto doesn't know where it's heading, it tries to be so much!   It started with realistic Ninjas like Zabusa and Haku and their mission to the mist village and after that the show started the Orochimaru thing and the Jutsus started to be alot more like magic tricks and a lot off people got sick of the show after that and than came the fillers... and that's when most fans got sick of it. 200 episodes where nothing happened! And after that Shippuden... and that's when I started to get tired of it, I skipped the fillers of course, but shippuden tried to be way to dramatic and serious. It's luck if there's one joke per episode!  .............but I still kept watching but then, Naruto Shippuden Fillers. And I gave up. I don't care anymore what happens to Naruto.    But I did use to like it, but the fillers and the constant theme change in the show is just such a turn off. So now I don't care. I don't like, I don't hate or love it... I just ignore the thing.|`|oLXl4BaMaa	i like naruto because he's still human compared to son gokou who can destroy a planet with great power.|`|ZfsgIDa0aa	The manga. That's why. It's a great story, really is. But the problem with the anime is the drawing out (flash backs every 4 seconds) and fillers that occur, because they always (supposedly) catch up with the manga.|`|jmo7CpiIaa	I like naruto because of kakashi (my fav. character) he's really hot & funny|`|LJzHR4zhaa	I love it cause it's action is very complicated, there are a lot of fights, the characters are amazing...

YnG0Tjxjaa	I am definitely not a supporter. It's like, where's the line? And the researching for all this to be a success, like removing awareness and consciousness, there would be many failed, sick attempts, I am sure, that would destroy the value of human rights.     Plain and simple: We're getting too smart for our own good.    We need natural diseases and old age to kill us off. This planet is overpopulated as is, and the more it is overpopulated, the less the value of life becomes.    Sad, but true.    We are a strange being.|`|KAobIFvoaa	Yes I think it is a fantastic idea. It's not murder as long as they are not grown with conciousness or awareness of their surroundings. It is however unlikly that they would ever do this as they can in fact grow the organs using stem cells outside of a living human body.     It is very short sighted to say that this would be murder, it is a gray area but science needs to be put ahead of 'morals' if the earth is to advance to new and better things. Think of it this way, 1 grown body could save the life of 6 people or more, heart transplants are so rare and all other organs are not in easy supply.|`|ERGGLvYiaa	Considering your friend has no idea the consequences such a thing could have to the universe...keep them away from all sharp objects and tell them to read some philosophy.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	The idea has been thought of.

57e7865d60ee7efd9e478c51de8fe911aa	Seabiscuit gave people of that era renewed hope for a better tomorrow. People saw this rather-small race horse come from a weak beginning to finally winning multiple championship races.  Just like in the movie Cinderella Man (2005), the story of James Braddock, a supposedly washed up boxer who came back to become a champion, he and Seabiscuit were inspirational to the nation, especially the poor, in the 1930s.|`|lu4ufhm5aa	what was so popular during the great depression? the horse racing?|`|A4T3GXnjaa	Seabiscuit raced during the Great Depression, and was something of a runt, giving those suffering the hardships of the times an underdog to root for.    Cheers|`|olSj12Vkaa	why was what so popular during the Great Depression....seriously, your question doesnt make sense|`|3gfkA4Xeaa	In an era when Americans were in great need of heroic figures to help them forget their troubles, SEABISCUIT comes to the rescue. The picture relates a moving story of friendship and devotion in rehabilitating the main characters'fractured lives, as it interweaves the interactions between horse, jockey, trainer and owner and their adoring fans. The film accurately portrays the real people and events of those troubled times and how Seabiscuit "fixed us, every one of us."  Written by Dale Roloff

Justin Timberlake - Dead and Gone  lyrics    Chorus:   Ooooooo I ve been travelin on this road to long  Just trying to find my way back home  The old me is dead and gone dead and gone dead and gone  Ooooooo I ve been travelin on this road to long  Just trying to find my way back home  The old me is dead and gone dead and gone eeyy    Verse 1 (T.I.)  Ever had one of dem days u wish woulda stayd home  Run into a group of ni&&as getting they hate on  U walk by they get wrong u reply then sh*t get blown  Way outta proportion way past discussion   Just u against them, pick one then rush em  Figure you get jump, yeah that next  They dont wanna stop there now they bussin  Now u gushin, ambulance rushin u to the hospital with a bad concussion  Plus ya hit 4 times bullet hit ya spine paralyzed waist down now ya wheel chair bound  Nevermind that now u lucky to be alive, Just think it all started u fussin with 3 guys  Now ya pride in the way but ya pride is the way u could *uck around get shot die anyday  Ni&&as die every day all over bull sh*t dope money dice game ordinary hood sh*t   Could this be cuz of hip hop music or did the ones with the good sense not use it  Usually ni&&as dont kno what to do whith their back against the wall so they just start shootin  For red or for blue or for blow I guess, from Bankhead upto ya projects  No more stray, now im straight, now I get it now I take  Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my familys sake  That part of me left yesterday the heart of me is strong today  No regrets im blessed to say the old me dead and gone away.    Chorus    Verse 2 (T.I.)  I aint never been scared, I lived through tragic  Situations coulda been dead lookin back at it  Most of that sh*t didnt even have to happen  But u dont think about it when u out there trappin  In apartments hangin smokin and rappin  Ni&&as start sh*t next thing ya kno we cappin  Get locked up then didnt even get mad  Now think about damn what a life I had  Most of that sh*t look back just laugh  Some sh*t still look back get sad  Maybe my homboy still be around   Had I not hit the ni&&a in the mouth that time  I won that fight, I lost that war  I can still see my ni&&a walkin out that door  Whoda thought Id never see Philant no more  Got enough dead homies I dont want no more  Cost a ni&&a his job, cost me more  Ida took that ***-whoopin now for sure  Now think before I risk my life  Take them chances to get my stripe  A ni&&a put his hands on me alright  Otherwise stand there talk sh*t all night  Cuz I hit you , you sue me,   I shoot you, get locked up, who me?  No more stress, now im straight, now I get it now I take  Time to think before I make mistakes just for my familys sake  That part of me left yesterday the heart of me is strong today  No regrets im blessed to say the old me dead and gone away.    Chorus  Verse 3 (J.T.)  I turn my head to the east I dont see nobody by my side  I turn my head to the west still nobody in sight  So I turn my head to the north, swallow that pill that they call pride  The old me is dead and gone, the new me will be alright  I turn my head to the east I dont see nobody by my side  I turn my head to the west still nobody in sight  So I turn my head to the north, swallow that pill that they call pride  The old me is dead and gone, the new me will be alright    Chorus|`|JS9v8ZEzaa	dead and gone, by t.i. featuring justin timberlake|`|zJXCbrjyaa	T.I. - Dead and Gone|`|UJrZHOLvaa	Dead And Gone - T.I. feat Justin Timberlake :)

Here's something to compare it to   Like the little things you used to do   Like giving more than you take   Funny how the reasons grow   Then the very next things you know   The odds change, dividing up the cake   [Chorus]     Don't worry 'bout me baby   I'll along somehow   I'll fall in love again   Yes it's all right   Yes it's all right    huggssss   M

etxSRf3Raa	It really all depends. I know that Summit has the rights to Breaking Dawn but some people are hesitant to see it made because of many factors in the book Bella's graphic labor, a baby actor that could pull of the description of Renesmee and her insane aging, among others. But at this rate if New Moon and Eclipse do well in the box office ( it probably will ), they might make Breaking Dawn ( a 2 part movie is what Stephanie Meyer wanted, and probably outrage of some disgruntled Twilight Fans.)|`|OV66q85iaa	You would have to wait, dear.    It will be a good 3 or 4 years before Breaking Dawn will be done.|`|lfKJndaeaa	I beleive Stephanie Meyer said she was doubtful about a film of Breaking Dawn because of Renesmee. After all she is a fully aware newborn baby and it would be hard to do everything about her with CGI and yet still have an actor play her correctly. If you think about it it does make sense because usually movies that have young children in them if they are the main character they are old enough to follow directions but if the are infants they are not in many scenes of the film besides sleeping, being fed, or carried around.     I hope that helps!|`|Auf3qhkwaa	they are making new twilight movies but you should boycott them because they're evil godless trash.    And stephanie meyer wrote some self fantantasy crap that should've been on fan fic.com but somehow got published and read by stupid people|`|LDgS0FwCaa	THIS IS NOT TRUE!! it is not known yet but    film companies have signed up the first 3 books that doesnt mean that the 4th one wont be made.. though i think if it does.. they may need to cut out lots of areas....   most definately breaking dawn will be signed up too if the 2nd and 3rd ones get a good review and audience..    they cant just keep it hanging..

I haven't listened to any of the songs from any these bands except one or two songs from Death Cab for Cutie they are not tried out by me and I can't tell you what you are signing up for. I have a friend who is emo and I have seen her listening to these bands so I figure that these will be fun for you, and these music are pretty heavy metal.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	You would probally like Theatre of Tragedy (kinda like the birthday massacre)  Zeromancer   Deadstar Assembly  Orgy|`|sj0ClUIdaa	dead! - my chemical romance  disenchanted - my chemical romance  pale bride - von bondies  cmon cmon - von bondies  broken man - von bondies  call me - blondie  never wanted to dance - mindless self indulgence|`|AA11353245	She Wants Revenge might suit your fancy, they're a bit like the cure.  As well VAST may be up your alley.  For stuff like The Birthday Massacre ( a great band by the way)  you can try Orgy or for a more industrial slant on that style either OhGr or Skinny puppy, but your mileage may vary with that (if you like Nine inch Nails you'll probably enjoy them).  And besides that I'll throw Type O Negative out there for the sake of it.  Finally, though you probably won't like it, I'll say Samael.  I thought of them when you mentioned HIM (Bam Margera likes both) but they have a style you probably won't enjoy, but I'd give it a shot anyway.|`|tnkp8n2Zaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUS3PJ2Pt...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYvAIqexG...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krmowThBY...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HpgdriP5...  tom tom club http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR44slemN...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiRNfWpEK...    we throw at u some songs, (bands) WHILE U R JUST HANGING play and u will see why we love those that are somewhat unknown but loved.|`|Rds4eGIyaa	power metal is the most prominent genre for fantasy.

Some artists similar to the Birthday Massacre (metal/goth sound paired with female vocals):  Lacuna Coil, the Gathering, Nightwish.    Some of my own favorites, which are more classic goth rock:    The Sisters of Mercy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWvOHT0zf...    Fields of the Nephilim: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYYy862KF...    Dead Can Dance - they had a male and female vocalist, I'm linking to a track with the female vocalist, but they did a lot of different things in their long career: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xpkRj99F...    Claire Voyant - Love the Giver remix by Covenant.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dIfaiYP1...|`|iyFibWTWaa	You like terrible music. You should listen to the sound of 1,000,000 crickets dying.

Maybe they should lock him up in Arkham Asylum!|`|mBlcD6sRaa	depression    give me a break    i saw it on sydney tv    if ever australia needs the death penalty this is it|`|8VlDuMFOaa	This story has rocked me all day, and everytime i see the news footage it makes me cry.  Imagine the terror that the little girl would have felt...imagine the torment her 2 brothers will feel for the rest of their lives after witnessing this...and the poor paramedics and police that were first on the scene -  and worst of all, a mother who has lost her only daughter..  It really is one of the most heartbreaking things I have EVER heard, and living not too far from where it happened makes it hit home a little harder.  If those barriers were put up like they should have been 5 years ago, maybe this would never have happened.  And maybe if the father was so unstable with depression, he should not have been allowed access to his children without supervision.  Another job well done by our depatrment of human services.      the worst crime imaginable deserves the upmost punishment...let him rot in jail with access to all the inmates -I am thinking he wont survive long in prison once they get their hands on him.|`|PYmdmuw8aa	Death.|`|AA11900717	he should be thrown off the same bridge|`|m7UyjPipaa	Have him tied down and let him smell my very, unbrushed, skanky breath.|`|LoRgAmc6aa	He should be castrated and then hanged. I suffer from depression and would NEVER do something like that. Depression is no excuse to kill, although some people will use it as one.|`|l6Kii2Uiaa	Death, they should throw his off a cliff crashing into the rocks below|`|qOgdJEMOaa	Throw him off the Brookyn Bridge.. Even better, dont put him under suicidal watch.|`|XS0ltAYaaa	His depression should not be taken into account. I have suffered from that for years, but I would never dream of physically hurt anyone, let alone one of my own children.   This person should be treated like any other murderer, lock him up & throw away the key. If he commits suicide then all the better, he'll not be a drain on the pocket of the tax payer.|`|vVYj8b74aa	Let him kill himself.|`|zoulSmjUaa	I heard about that thats terrible. I feel so sorry for the children having to see their sister well you know and the girl too   I think he should go to jail or death but he has depression so im not really sure but its still wrong how could he throw her off the bridge??????|`|pW31jMWQaa	Lots of people get depressed, this is not an excuse for his actions. But i bet he is nice and warm and well fed tonight.  His each and every need is now being pandered too.  Pity his little daughter who is lying on a cold hard slab all alone waiting on an autopsy, hasn't got the comfort he has.|`|bbF2oSX2aa	OMG this is soooooooo bad that poor little girl........what an idiot father.    But seriously i dont think he should be killed coz he has depression so he probably wants to die......they should make him go to jail for the rest of his life and make him have a terrible life killing him isnt going to teach him a lesson. But it makes me so angry that someone could do that to their own daughter :(|`|mxOPLCBzaa	well as for me i only live about 15 minutes from the westgate brigde i was shocked....maybe the father was planning to kill the other two brothers some whre else?|`|gjsKWg04aa	Whilst a lot of people need to be upset and angry right now (and I totally understand this need), does anyone actually know for sure that he has depression? Depression can be a feature of a much more serious mental ilness. He could have been totally dillusional schizophrenic or something. His mental ilness was possibly why the marriage broke down to begin with.  Nonetheless the man must be removed from society as a means to protect the innocent. I'm sure he has a life of internal torture ahead of him. Punishment will be whatever is in his mind. I wonder how many more "time-bombs" are out there?

qoS3gUukaa	Lol I love the word "oiks" it makes me laugh!    And you are very correct it is irony but I doubt if it enters old Jeremy's head. He is getting his pay packet at the end of the month and the drones fill up the stages day in day out. He is laughing all the way to the bank! (Still incrediblygood entertainment though, but don't tell anyone I watch it!) Xx|`|1QiPrFyfaa	of course!   i can't stand him anyway!  all he does is tell people " shut it! you've had your say now it's my turn.|`|huto12P3aa	haha i didnt notice that, but yea it is a bit hypricritical|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Yes he is a hypocrite but id still do him :P|`|C3sqTngtaa	yes well spotted - never thought about it really!|`|9q7MZUpeaa	Ha! Yes love, Jeremy Kyle is a massive hypocrite! Not just in your example but there are plenty of others. I started off watching and researching Jeremy Kyle because he annoyed me so much, for reasons that you have discussed. I ended up finding some funny quotes of his. One of my favourites being:   "And guess what, sweetheart... he was telling the truth!"     Very good question! You should take a look at the quotes, I mean, there are some really funny ones as well as ones that show he is a massive hypocrite.|`|ryEiHFOnaa	I never notice.|`|PPyMhRJAaa	He is such a hypocrite! I find it amusing to watch. Where on earth do they find these 'people' from who go on his show? They have awful teeth, greasy hair and dress like tramps. I really don't know how they could humiliate themselves like that. Jeremy says 'get a job' and if they say they have one, he just says 'well get another one then'!   PS - Put something on the end of it - lol!|`|NBjta8Kyaa	LOL  i never realised that before    !!!!|`|d1guDJzyaa	Ha Ha i never noticed that!!  It is a bit hypocritical!!!  I personally think that the Jeremy Kyle show is fixed so they can hire  the biggest chav's ever!!!|`|721V5Busaa	You should get a job.  Only joking-no offence intended|`|ypI6NpHwaa	Hate that show, All he goes on about is ive done this, ive done that. Or this is my show - shut up and let me talk!!! What an ****!|`|l2fvNCDmaa	Yes when I first sure that I felt exactly the same. They claim to be helping people but at the same time they are advertising the bingo site which may addict people to gambling. They probably get sponsored alot more from that bingo company then other helpful companies. If people see Jeremy Kyle show sponsoring it maybe it will tempt them into thinking that it wouldn't be gambling.     I agree indeed very ironic

jNwkgcTCaa	Scott McKenzie    It says in the description.
DC2TZwXRaa	Hi    From a quick look at your vedic chart, it is a little difficult.  I have the same placements as you for lagna, sun, moon, venus & mercury (by sign and house) so I hope you will hear me out.    You have no grahas in detrimental rasi signs in either your rasi or navamsa chart, but have Venus and Sun in rulership in the rasi.    Both Moon (Chandra) in 7th and Mercury (Budha) in the 12th house are quite weakened / challenged by their positions, but not malefic per say:    -  Chandra in 7th has no support (no planets in the houses on either side), suggesting your mind may feel somewhat unsupported especially since it is with Ketu (which is strong in Sg); but this is offset to some extent in your navamsa chart with Chandra in Cancer in 10th.    -  Budha in 12th can destroy finances due to excessive spending on little luxuries (and perhaps not making sound judgements), as Venus in Pi in the 10th rules your 12th house & Jupiter is in Li; but this is offset in your navamsa chart with Budha in Gemini (in the 6th - possibly you have dharma of eventually conquering any enemies).    Jupiter and Mars are a mixed bag (retrograde & conj Saturn respectively).    In your chart, Saturn in 10th in navamsa can bring rewards to career in time but it is definitely in need of propitiation as it is with Moon in your navamsa (reducing your sensitivity in outlook) & with Mars in the 4th in your rasi.    On this basis, I think Saturn is most malefic & in need of propitiation.      And your Moon, although not malefic, is very weakened and in need of strong remedies also.

QgxZOI4Iaa	NO!  they shouldn't be!  I was thinking the same thing a couple of days ago, and wanted to ask the same question.   I mean, Rap & Hip-Hop, belong in the same section, but Rock & Pop?  like can you put AC/DC with Lindsay Lohan in the same category or say the same concert?!  that would just be ridiculous..   I suggest we demand a category for Rock only and another like 5 categories for all its sub-genres, like Emo & Screamo in the same section, Indie & Alternative in a section... things that go well together!|`|283tO9j9aa	I think rock should have its own separate section- mind you, most of us in rock and pop are metalheads so it doesn't matter that much.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Yeah it is a bit of a confusing category. Pop only refers to 'popular' music, which could be of any genre including rock. Its not genre specific but people do tend to associate pop music with dance music which is a bit daft. Also other genres such as metal seem to get classed under the rock and pop group which annoys me! It is a total generalisation!|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	Pop by definition is what is POPular.  Any music can be popular.When R&R first started out it was the most popular of its time.  It then was segmented into the areas you describe.  So, you can have it your way.  But then you are saying rock isn't popular.|`|GrI8mCJyaa	Who gives a F*ck!!!    You still haven't asked a pertinent question for either category!!!    Turn off your computer!!    You've brought nothing to the table.    You came empty handed.|`|IIuafPfIaa	Hey, pop is as GOOD as rock, IMO.    Pop is much more harmonic and uses quite a lot of instruments (including orchestra), whereas rock only uses an electric guitar, drums and piano. BUT, there are symphonic rock songs (they use a lot of instruments, too).    So, please, don't dumb down pop. Cos, really, pop and rock are the only popular genres that use ACTUAL music (unlike rap. RnB and techno). Though some RnB and techno songs use instruments.    You hate pop probably cos of Britney Spears, Katy Perry and Lady Gaga crap. They are like, electropop type and I don't like them either. You shouldn't really hate the whole genre just cos you hate one subgenre of it.    I extremely dislike heavy rock/metal, but that doesn't mean I should be hating EVERY rock genre. You MUST know that even pop has many subgenres, like rock (piano pop, orchestral pop, folk pop, punk pop, etc).|`|SoF1F4uJaa	I reckon there should be a separate section for people who want to complain about Rock & Pop being in the same section.|`|6F32sfLeaa	the genres you are talking about are not so popular among the masses..........but combining them all forms the genre rock....and thats what is popular|`|PlwpUNSqaa	You are wrong, POP designates for all the music which are popular and on-going, like rock POP also got its credibility and people adore it in millions and more than rock. Rock got it's own excitement & I believe that both are important in music industry. POP also contains lot of subcategories like R&B, POP vocals, Electronics with vocals & Instrumental POP. So, comparing POP & ROCK is extremely difficult.|`|pElG2K61aa	No, each should be separate. Looking at Big Woof's answer, there should be no separate category for Rap and Hip Hop since both are far more popular than rock or top forty.|`|jNn91TwDaa	Congrats, you're the one millionth person to have asked this question|`|89xzNpVaaa	No i do NOT think so, i think Rock should be a different category, then divided into Heavy and Death Metal, Grunge, New Wave, Psychedelic.etc

xMHFIDs7aa	I think it's called Kouun no Rihatsushi.    Summary: Suffering from unrequited love, Todou Tsukasa, also called "the moody pillar", walks into a barbershop. The cheerful barber not only gives him a sexy new haircut, but also advice on how to better carry himself. Tsukasa takes that advice to heart and goes on to fame and success. But he never forgets the barber who helped him when he needed it, and so, he keeps dropping by the barbershop. However, confidence didn't come along with the new haircut nor the fame and success, and his feelings are neither conveyed nor understood well.    Hope this helps a bit. Enjoy! :D|`|TQYof9Whaa	http://www.mangafox.com/page/manga/serie...|`|kS5703KGaa	The title is Kou'un no Rihatsushi; it really is a one-shot but you might have thought it was a series because the scanlators released the first chapter as a oneshot and then a long time later released the 2nd & 3rd chapters.

Mr. Poe kept changing the subject because he did not want the children to piece together the puzzle that their parents were murdered and that the fire was not accidental.|`|t45zTGZdaa	couldnt have put it better myself Dan

1yFDY8xNaa	Yup, that sounds like a Scorpio, If you're not as much into him as he's into you..... RUN|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	I am a Scorpio and I can attest to an intensiveness.  However, most Scorpio's tend to sit back and take time to think before jumping into something with both feet.  We are very cautious.      Perhaps the situation is very real, I know people can and do fall in love that quickly but just to be safe talk to him and tell him you're afraid things are going too quickly.  If he loves you he will agree and back off.  I'm not saying you can't still have all the passion but that does not mean that wedding plans have to be made right this second.|`|EuwjIJ3Zaa	How about you refer to your question about the Pisces man you've also been dating for the past 4 months?    "Is Pisces male changing his mind about finishing relationship? Does this happen alot? ?"    If you can knock off the lies and the b/s...you may just have a chance with him.  Personally...I don't think there is a chance in hell, and you're strange.    Or, furthermore, how about your "Dating 2 men at once. ...?" question??
vrAmpR3Waa	It really depends    sometimes the music will hit you first....and you've got a good riff to build on . Some other times the lyrics will hit you first...then you build the beats on that lyrics or verse. It works both ways for me when writing my songs...i dont have a set method for writing songs because I CANT control my inspiration when it hits...it come to me and i just write it down and surrender to it.    though i think people prefer to write the lyrics first.|`|TBbhmZEwaa	i write my lyrics first... but i make up a tune in my head as i go.  I find writing the music first limits what i can do with my lyrics. Hope this helps!|`|roFGlldOaa	I usually go for the lyrics and think up a rhythm as I go. It depends on your style of music.|`|QY48ErA3aa	if u r a good musician then music first,    if u r a poet then lyrics first,    but u love to involve the inspiration both will comes...|`|f44bbc2cc318797f1da027440e2159ebaa	I'd write the lyrics first,as then i would be able to compose music that would go well with the lyrics.but then,it can be the other way round as well!|`|DTzWlHqwaa	You can do both, you cane make a beat and make your music flow with it or can write the words and make the music go with it, both good techniques but depends which one you like better and do best which is the most important, if you like making music, do the music first and make your lyrics go with it in a good flow but if you like writing lyrics vise versa, Like for me for example im good with making music so I make msuic and make my lyrics flow with it but again whichever works best fo you.|`|esdjKGeBaa	It depends on your inspiration, but I'd go lyrics first.|`|SrnmMMpCaa	it depends on what u like.....but i like 2 start off a song with music 1st otherwise people might not find the song that much of fun....like i have heard a song which has lyrics 1st and it does not sound that gud........but this is what i like:-)......i am just giving u an opinion and if u like it then i am really happy....but go with ur choice....this is my choice......but i just wanted 2 tell u that if u want 2 start ur song with lyrics it is also a gud idea because if u have heard the song - Happy Ending..by avril lavigne....it sounds gud......it stars with the lyrics........but i think most of the songs start with music so it might be unique if u started with lyrics but my music teacher say's that it is better 2 start a song with music....i've given all my information now it's all up 2 u ...............    Hope this helped.....  and hav fun with ur new song.......and just try 2 tell me what u hav decided at last,2 start with lyrics or with music.....  have fun....  best of luck    i am sooo sorry,after i saw all the answer's that has been suggested , at that time only i understood ur question,,,,,,,,,i thought u were asking whether u hav to  start a song with lyrics or music,,i missed the word 'write'......ok here is my opinion.....LYRICS FIRST.......because i like writing it that way....but as i said before.......your wish...this is just my opinion..............    Hope this helped  and again hav fun with ur song,and just try 2 let me know what u hav decided at last,just 2 keep in touch......bye, 'n' hav a nice day.......
