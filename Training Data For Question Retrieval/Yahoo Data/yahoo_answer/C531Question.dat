They had a very abusive childhood, not only physical but sexual and mental abuse as well. She was first sexually abused when she was just a toddler and countless more times throughout her childhood and teenage years. Her mother knew, but made her keep it to herself. She still does not know how to open up, and has gone to several different counselors who have not been able to help her recover from her childhood. She is severally depressed and confided in me that she is having suicidal thoughts. I am not the best person at giving advice, so I really need some help on this. Please do not be rude on such a serious matter. Any rude comments will be reported because I would like to show her the answers that are posted so she can read for herself the advice you give. Thank you so much for your kind and respectful answers.
20090222155703AAOLoSO	Health;General Health Care;First Aid	Side affects of putting hydrogen peroxide in your ears?	I have been having an allergic reaction to something since Wednesday night. I have a red rash with bumps over most of my body and my face is pretty swollen. I have been to the hospital twice already. One Dr. says it's from something I ate. The other Dr. thinks it is from some medication I have been taking. I have been trying to back track from the past week and I think I know what it could be from. I put a little hydrogen peroxide in my ears because they have been plugged. Do you think this is the reason for my rash? If so what can I do to get rid of it? What medication can I ask to have? How long will this last? Thanks in advance!!!

20090222160334AAb5ksX	Health;Mental Health	Is it possible to love yourself if you don't know who you are?	I've come to the conclusion that the reason I don't have many close friends nor ever been in a relationship at 21, is because of my inability to love myself. Part of the reason I can't love myself is because I haven't figured out who I am yet. For instance, I'm studying economics and business in college, but I know deep down, that these aren't my true passions. Basically I haven't found what I want out of life. I then tell myself that life has no meaning anyway, so nothing really matters.   Anyway, I realize that I do have some good traits...like I can be extremely funny at times and I'm easy to talk to. I then start thinking that maybe I am a decent person, just trying to find my way in life like everyone else and that I shouldn't be so hard on myself. But when it comes down to it, I don't know who I am or what I would like to be...so how can I truly love myself? Maybe I should just love that I'm trying to find myself..??

20090222160033AAamCen	Health;Diet & Fitness	Why  Can I not gain weight?	I am 16 years old and weigh 135 pounds and am close to 5'7 (maybe a little under). Anyways, it seems that I can eat whatever I want, and never gain a pound. Before I never really thought about it, but then in health last week we learned the formula for calculating caloric equilibrium..... mine is only 1850 calories a day... Now I eat probably close to twice that amount. For example, a few weeks ago we went on vacation to the Dominican Republic, And every day I would eat like 2 ice creams, 4 smoothies, and cheeseburgers, and fajitas and all that junk food... Lost a pound when I came back, because that is actually less than what I normally eat!!!! So far today I've been to Mcdonalds and eaten a double quarter pounder with cheese, half my moms big mac, fries, a double cheese burger, and then I had girl scout cookies.       It's actually Really weird because I am actually fairly muscular, like Not buff or anything like Arnold, But I do have a six pack and stuff like that.      So my question is, should I just continue to eat whatever I want? ( my cholestoral and all that other doctor crap is perfect), or should I eat what my caloric equilibrium is supposed to be? Thank you.

20090222160542AAxf4pg	Health;Diet & Fitness	Do I have a drinking problem?	I'm 15, and I'll drink a lot like it's always on my mind.   But I personally don't think I'm addicted to it   I drank every morning before school to make school go by faster   but I eventually ran out of alcohol because my mom hasn't bought any for a while, unfortunately.   anyway so I used to get a little drunk but not completely wasted before school. Usually tequila or vodka.   my friends joke and say I'm an alcoholic but I don't think so.   I haven't had anythign to drink for a few weeks now, but I know thats mainly because we only have beer and I don't feel like drinking bud light every day. I know that if we had a good wine and vodka and tequila I would probably drink it everyday, but only because I want school to go by real fast. I'm reallly actually good at it, my grades didn't decrease so my mom didn't suspect anything and my friends didn't know anything until one day it slipped because I drank too much one day, and told my friend to watch over me or something like that. anyway what do you think? do I have a problem? What should I do?

I do not have that kind of money - I have applied to several jobs over the past few months with no success. My parents refuse to give me any money to fix them and I hate going to the dentists anyway.

Is there any way I can possibly fix my teeth without going to the dentist?

I am into the second week and no sign of weight loss yet.  The weight is stable, not gaining or losing.   I know this is the healthy way, but I am so tempted to restrict my diet again.      I am so tempted to not eat as much.      Please say something positive and inspirational to keep me motivated, I am so weak, I feel like I will cave again!

20090222111126AAz9bX3	Health;Mental Health	Very Important question, please answer.?	ok so i think about suicide very often(practically everday but it's been less the last couple weeks cause i got a bf now and i'm a little happeir)   But i think i need help, and i want to go to my school guidance consoler but i don't want him to tell my parents. So would a guidance consoler have to tell parents about it.  Cuase i don't want my parents to worry or blame themselves or have to waste their time and money with a phycologist or whatever help i'd need. But i want to go to my guidance consoler cause i think i really need help now, i've been thinking about suicide practically everyday for months with the first time i thought about ending my life being like four years ago.  And my li life aint too bad right now, and it's not like i'm really unhappy, i just wanna die.  I'm actually happy, i'm doing alright in school, i got a bf, i got plenty of friends, i mean my brother has been very sick for over two years and doctor's don't know what's wrong with him still, which is another reason why i don't want my parents to know because they're already really stressed.     Yea i wrote a lot, i guess i kinda need to vent a little. but also neded to give you the whole story.     But yea-Must guidance consolers tell parents about a kid whose suicidal.  And if i say that i used to be suicidal, would that work(right at this moment i'm not too suicdal, but yesterday i was very depressed but i can go from okay and content to depressed very quickly) I mean i wouldn't mind seeing him to talk about it like every week or so if he wants continued meetings with me.     Please answer my question.  I mean i'm getting kinda worried about myself, i know suicide is bad, but why?   And write what you please-no hate though- but i know most of you will prob say stuff like you need help, just tell him, or your parents. but most of you problably don't understand.    And i have told a few of my friends before, (but i know they kinda know i think about it but i don't know if they know how seious it is with me and that so many times i come close to attempting it) But i didn't tell all of my friends, like not my best best freinds because i don't want to worry them. And Should i tell my boyfriend(we've not that serious, we like just started going out.) but we've been friends for years.  For guys, if your girlfreind was suicidal would you want her to tell you. And would you be feel better if your girlfreind(or friend even) told you she's sucidal, and then killed herself, or just killed herself without you evening knowing you thought like that?      Ok i'm sorry i wrote so much, but i hope you took the time to answer and help me.

20090222104319AAyQBoZ	Health;Diet & Fitness	Help! I am having major issues with my eating?	I'm very hard on myself and my appearance. Lately if I've been having a day where I feel unattractive I will do stuff like eat nothing but salmon and vegetable sticks for my meals.       Eating stresses me out so much as i won't eat anything that isn't super healthy.       I've been so obsessed with it if someone at work gives me a chocolate I will take some and then throw it in the bin when no one is watching. I feel guilty when i eat chocolate and i even have post it notes on my fridge that say 'no chocolate!'      Also every time i go out for dinner all i ever eat is salmon and salad and i don't let them put any sauce on it. My friends get annoyed i think because i say i cant go to a restaurant unless salmon is on the menu. I also went to my friends birthday dinner and ate nothing but salad because everything else had stuff in it i dont eat.      I get stressed about food constantly wanting to have a perfect diet. I never treat myself. I also think i dont look good enough and i get annoyed at myself saying its not good enough i have to look better and i make my diet even more strict.      This is what i eat on a typical day:      Breakfast - 2 glasses of milk with flaxseed oil in it or oatmeal      Lunch - smoked salmon and avocado sandwich      Dinner - capsicum and carrot sticks and a bowl of spinach leaves      I just dont get very hungry a lot of the time or i feel unattractive and that makes me feel like not eating much. I'm not fat I'm only 50 kg.      Do you think i have issues with food?

I don't have like, and fat on my body at all but I want to tone muscles; especially my abs. does it work? and if so, how long was it before you started seeing results?

20090222130336AAAeKnT	Health;Diet & Fitness	Are these supplements worth buying and taking?	I'm trying to follow this 13 Weeks to Hardcore Fat Burning diet from abcbodybuilding ( http://abcbodybuilding.com/13weekstohard...  It looks pretty good but there are some supplements that it suggests that I never thought of buying before because I figured that they were a waste. But I'll list them and some others, let me know if you think they're worth it or not. I'm kinda on a budget.      -Glutamine   Recommends 20-25 grams of glutamine a day, spread over three meals, to enhance recovery      -Chromium   Recommends at least 400 ug of chromium a day to increase insulin sensitivity      Those are the major ones I was wondering about...it also suggests to take an additional 3 grams of vitamin C, on top of a multi vitamin.      Please let me know what you think. Also, does anyone know of the best site to order supplements such as these? Vitamins, minerals, capsule form supplements?

I'm 21 years old and am currently working to be a personal trainer/nutritionist so I spend a lot of my time in the gym using my own body as the guinea pig so I know how to properly help my future clients. My body type is half ectomorph and half mesomorph meaning that I'm really thin/lean, but at the same time really toned/semi-muscular. At first I was very proud of my accomplishments and felt good that I had done something good for my body, but now I'm starting to feel self conscious about my arms. I went out to dinner last night with co-workers and found myself actually keeping on my jacket so some guy wouldn't think I look disgusting. I can honestly say I don't know what caused this feeling...but lately I've been feeling that the only guys I can only now date are gym guys because normal guys might think it's gross to date a girl whose defined. I guess what I'm asking is....am I being ridiculous?      Thank you for your time!

I need to be 110 for the blood drive, but I keep losing weight as fast as I gain it.      How can I keep gaining weight without losing any of it? :'(

20090222165108AAO40l7	Health;Diet & Fitness	How to get skinner legs/thighs/butt?	It's just my lower body that's the problem. My stomach and arms are all okay, but I can't seem to get my lower body thinner, and because of this, I'm really self conscious about what jeans I wear, or who's walking behind me. Which totally sucks. So~, any suggestions?      Also, please take note of the fact that I'm not rich, so I can't exactly buy some fancy exercising machine. And I can't exactly head over to gym, either, since 1) I can't pay for it and 2) I can't drive. Umm, I can't take pills either. My parents are totally against that. I don't plan on going anorexic, either, but if you could tell me what foods to stay away from, or how I should limit my eating, that would be great.      In case it matters, I'm about 5"0 and 108-110 lbs.... oO I'm not exactly sure if that's bad or not... But that doesn't really matter, I just want skinner legs, hahaha

I'm 21, male...I'm kind of a heavy drinker, not really at bars or anything, but more of the type that drinks at home by myself just so i don't feel anything. I feel "normal" when im drunk.I recently i met the most incredible woman i have ever talked to..she is the one that I just feel right with. She loves everything i love (not including alcohol...she doesn't know i drink) we met about a month ago an every time we go out together i feel so right with her, i feel like shes the one i want to be with forever. But every time our date is over an i go home or she goes home i feel so incredibly depressed..its such a horrible feeling... I cant explain it, not even alcohol can make me feel better (which is weird because even if i lost my house, job an car all in one day, getting drunk would make me not even care) I never really had a mom growing up an...is that why im getting so attached so quickly?

My wife had a spontaneous miscarriage, she was prescribed Vicodin to control strong pain from cramps (she has never taken that medicine before).  A total of 4 pills in a period of 24 hours were ingested as prescribed, but the Vicodin is giving her a lot of drowsiness so she suspended it.       Her usual cramp pain control medicine is Buscopan (or Buscapina in Spanish) which she only takes in case of severe menstrual cramps.

20090222171537AApFkOO	Health;Mental Health	How to know if you might be bipolar?	I know the only way to really know is to go to a doctor and get a diagnosis, but I don't want to if I probably don't have bipolar disorder. But I think I might.      I've gone to a few websites and looked at symptoms of bipolar disorder/taken quizzes and all that and they all keep pointing to possible bipolar II disorder.     I sometimes get really hyper; I talk really fast and I make no sense and I get really jittery and crazy. Usually when I'm like this I can't fall asleep, and in the mornings I wake up really energetic (which is pretty odd because otherwise I'm NOT a morning person. at all)  Sometimes I'm really confident and I love everything about myself and I feel like I'm amazing and on top of the world.  Sometimes I really want to hang out with my friends, even just talk to them on the phone or text so I'll call them at random times for no reason at all and want to talk for hours.       Other times though I get really sad for no reason at all. I'll tell my self I have no reason to be upset, but I can't shake the depression.  That's what's been happening this evening: I've been feeling really sluggish and sad, like I have no interest in doing anything and I can't think of anything interesting that's going to happen (but I know there is! it just doesn't seem as interesting as it should I guess) and I feel like crying but I don't know why! I also get really irritable and easily annoyed sometimes.  And when I'm like this I DON'T want to talk to people at all.  I'll just feel tired and heavy and dull and useless and sad and want to be left alone.      And then there's the most annoying times when I'm both! Like really hyper but really depressed. Or really irritable but like I really want to hang out with my friends.      So is it bipolar?   What should I do?      I'm 15, by the way.  I know that teenage girls have a lot of emotional stuff going on anyway, it just feels like this is more...well, basically more bipolar than what my friends talk about with their moods.      :] thanks!

This to modern day society seems like a bad idea because were surrounded by food everywhere but our ancestors had days of fasting from lack of food. If also after the day of fasting you ONLY EAT RAW FRUITS AND VEGGIES so if it does store food, it will be very healthy foods that can easily be burned.

If it doesn't take 2hours to work like they say Claritin does, i'll keep a bottle around for when im really in need to a antihistamine and not needing to drive lol.       Thanks

20090222183439AAzDLGW	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	How does sleep effect your health?	I know there are short term effects like baggy eyes and blotchy-looking skin. But for me it doesn't matter how long I sleep or what time I go to bed. It just matters what time I wake up. For example, if I go to sleep at 9 PM and wake up at 7 AM (10 hours of sleep) I have really bad bags and I look horrible because I woke up early. Meanwhile, if I go to bed at 5 AM and wake up at 10 AM (5 hours of sleep) I look great because I woke up later.      But since I have started getting less hours of sleep and waking up later, when it gets later at night I find myself forgetting things and it's harder to retain information. Are these long term effects that come with the lack of hours snoozing? What are some long term effects of less sleep time?

I had a cavity/hole before in one of my tooth and the dentist said that since I don't have an extra tooth that would come out to replace it they would just leave it the way it is. They weren't gonna take it out nor were they gonna fix it. But over a few weeks that cavity/hole became larger to the point where food would get stuck in it and it hurted and they finally just took it out. Could they have fixed this cavity/hole though when it was smaller or were they just too lazy to do so?       Now, I have another cavity/hole in my back tooth that is quite opened and I think it gets bigger too as days past. Food gets stuck in it and it has some sensitivity to it as well.

Here's the plan.      1 hour of dance dance revolution and 1 hour of wii boxing.( vigorously dodging and jumping as if Im using a rope between rounds and after rounds are finished so non-stop movement.) 200 crunches,100 sidebends, 50 squats, 50 push-ups, 4 times a week      1200 calories a day consisting of tons on fruits and vegetables       would it work?

20090222171007AAFEuJ0	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Chest Pain - All tests done - Stop worrying?	I'm a 31 yr old female working manual labor ( for the past 10 years) experiencing on and off again back pain radiating to my chest(after work)sometimes this seems to elevate my heart rate and I have felt tightening and SOB(shortness of breath).This seems to be increase with physical activity - mainly lifting and bending over.  I have no problems walking around and no problems with a mild jog, although intense workouts bring on the pain ( and sometimes dizziness) I have gone to the hospital and to my primary physician. I have had several EKGs, and the last trip to the ER they did a full blood profile( all cardiac enzymes and D-dimers too), a CT scan with contrast of the heart and pulmonary arteries, an echo and a chest xray.  Everything looked really good.  No sign of cardiac problems, I mean spotless! I was given oxycodone for the pain after a full ER exam. However, I do suffer from GAD and panic attacks and they are getting worse because of the pain and the pain gets worse with the attack.  I do not take birth control and do not smoke. My BP is 120/80 and according to my doctor my heart attack risk is really low. She put my on Xanax and also a beta blocker to help slow my heart rate even though she said it wasn't because she saw a heart problem. I am overweight but I eat healthy and get some exercise (mostly at work!) and I am now eating even better and I have lost about 5 pounds because I'm scared to death I am going to have a heart attack.  I'm still scared even though I know everything came out ok with the tests.  Any advise would help.

I had my ear cartilage pierced at Piercing Pagoda. I only had a problem with my ears being allergic to nickel after a year of having them.       Now, this past weekend I decided to wear my birthstone studs I got when I first got them pierced and after wearing them for maybe fourteen hours, I came home and my ear was painful to touch (Btw, I never had a problem with these earrings before). I quickly took out my earring, thinking the pain would subside, but after two days it still hurts.       When I touch it is quite painful and slightly swollen. When I push the piercing from the back the hole itself is really red and gross. I know it is either reacting to some sort of metal or they are infected. Any suggestions would help. :)

Before I say anything I will inform you that I did not have erectile dysfunction before this problem. Last year at gym class we were playing dodgeball and this dude threw a soft dodgeball reall hard at me and it hit my penis. After that I fell to the ground and it hurt so bad. I went home and I saw that I couldn't hol an erection for more than 5 seconds and they weren't hard either. I could bend my penis while it was erect. My doctor is a lazy idiot who keeps saying its not that it's genetics and never gives me a referral to a urologist. Recently I visited the urologist and he said nothing was wrong without even check the problem. This is really pissing me off and I'm scared! what do I do??

OK, so let me start by saying I don't want a bunch of people saying Oh how stupid. I just want people to answer who actually want to help. OK, so in Mid-October I fell off my ankle in PE, but I didn't think much of it, so I kept working out. On New Year's Eve, I went to the Dr and she said I sprained it. So then about three weeks later, I went to an Orthopedic Specialist and had X-rays and and MRI done. So then at the end of January, I am informed that my growth plate is cracked. So I am put in a brace and take PT. so, now I have been in PT for 3 weeks, and my ankle still feels the same, if not worse, then before. I have a follow-up with my Orthopedic dude on March 12, but I was wondering when surgery is necessary for a broken ankle. He said I might need it anyway because I can "sublux" my tendon, so he had originally thought I'd torn it. So he thinks I will need surgery to have my groove deepened. But my question is "Do you think I will need surgery for my broken ankle?" Thanks in advance.

Walking was nearly impossible and I missed an entire week of school.    Once the clinic open up after being closed over the weekend, I went to see a doctor and was given an antibiotic, ciprofloxicin, to cure my diagnosed UTI.    I have been fine since, but am am afraid of it coming back.    I have been more cautious and have been drinking Cranberry juice.    I have still been having sex with my boyfriend, but we've been more safe. i.e. going to the bathroom after sex, using bathroom wipes to make sure I'm clean.       For the past few day though, I have been experiencing pain in my upper abdomen.  And some sex positions make it worse.    It's not cramps, and it's nowhere near as bad as the pain I had before.       Is it possible that I haven't been careful enough and that I'm getting another UTI so soon?      Please help!
