6QJe4Mlyaa	Try any Mexican market. I normally see the carnita's on the weekend anyway.  If they usually have carnita's ask for how much you want reserved.<br>  If you have no luck there contact your favorite Mexican restaurant and ask if they can make it for you.  Give them a day or two notice and I am sure they could do it.<br>  Best of all make it yourself it is not hard.  Just a little time consuming.  Remember do not over season the meat because as it cooks the seasonings concentrate and become more intense.  (Learned that by accident.)

It turned me off of fast food junkism.  Take  can of lard, and measure out the amount in ounces of fat that each meal you eat is putting into your body.  Put it onto a white paper plate.  You'll end up with a heap of fat and think about it every time you "crave" your McDonalds fix.  In all things moderation...try to limit yourself to 1 meal a day, and then one every other, and then per week, per month, etc.  Replace the foods with healthier alternatives.  Also, downsize that meal.  Get a medium or a small.  Better yet, skip the combo, their fries suck anyway.

Perhaps you could ask a nutritionist or call MacDonalds head office.  And find out how long the food would keep if you put it in a refrigerator until eaten for your evening snack.  Ask specifically for the type of "healthy options"' you buy.  Unless you get some good answers, don't buy for the evening.  Also, make sure the food tastes right, as a poor taste can be a signal of spoilage.<br>  <br>  You didn't ask if eating the amount of MacDonalds you eat every day  is a healthy diet, but that is another question worth asking the nutritionist.|`|BnqjD1P2aa	10 minute after preparation and serving.|`|YFeznXFOaa	like 30 min the most|`|khJYKSUraa	not long|`|s99TUYjaaa	15 min.

HkrVHk5iaa	Before you ask for a transfer, you need to ask if the McDonald's where you work if they also own the one you want to go to. Even though they are both McDonald's, they may be run by different franchisees. If it owned by different people, you will probably have to apply at the other restaurant just like you would if you weren't working at all. However, if it owned by the same company, you should be able to transfer without a problem, unless of course they are short-handed where you are or the other place is fully staffed or slow. Good Luck.|`|jQxlZP6paa	You should ask to be transferred so you'll have more time to study (makes you sound smart) or to save gas (makes you sound smart and eco aware).  Then ask a manager what you need to do to get promoted. Always have the next step in mind even if you don't intend to take it.  You might need that person as a reference when you leave. Showing initiative, even at Mc D's is initiative.|`|JfVxCDb7aa	I doubt they will do it.<br>  <br>  They have trouble hanging on to RELIABLE wrokers, is the reason|`|sqPoFZ00aa	You should be able to. I don't see why not. You should ask McDonald's, though.|`|TrTfowAQaa	when you ask make sure your current mcD's has a full staff. also make sure the one you want to move to could use another hand. when you ask make sure you are clear about wanting to transfer because it's closer. don't make the management feel like its because of them. aslo make sure the team at the other store is a crew you can get along with.|`|yb01tlviaa	what!?  Youre seriously asking YA if you should ask to be TRANSFERRED!?  You need to get a brain of your own and start becoming a real person. Go ask if you can be transferred, and from now on, small decisions like this that have a very simple answer should be answered by your brain, not by people on YA.|`|YwZSSwhMaa	You are mean to work at McDonalds!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  play this.<br>  maybe you will transfer to a DIFFERENT JOB!!:<br>  <a href="http://www.mcvideogame.com/index-eng.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mcvideogame.com/index-eng.htm...</a>|`|5vtZVLdIaa	Ya really comeon now you can make  that descion for yourself espically at Mcdonalds
JfVxCDb7aa	I've notived a number of them do that,<br>  <br>  even worse, if you pick something like general tso's chicken<br>  <br>  they'll give you a couple that are all fat and no chicken !!!!<br>  <br>  That was a diff. chain, I NEVER went back !!|`|Ela3o96Raa	Their not stingy, they just give you authentic eastern dishes, served in the exact size as they were originally. Which would be 3 grains of rice, half of a peice of General Tso's chicken and a crumb from an eggroll all for the low low price of 42.99!! Its a steal!<br>  <br>  Seriously though, I know what your talking about and its pure BS to me. I'd much rather walk across the food court and pay 10 bucks for a slice of pizza than pay 15 bucks for the smallest meal ive ever seen in my entire life. Im 9 months pregnant here! I want larger portions!!! NOW!!!|`|q8cBE6w8aa	On your next visit, if they do it again, politely ask to talk to the manager and tell the manager you feel you are not getting as much as you used to get.  Honestly figure out if you still feel ripped of - if so, go elsewhere.|`|JQhYc5DVaa	because its become super popular and theyve became greedy with money and ungenerous with their food :o(<br>  <br>  same with mcdonalds<br>  their big macs are like small macs now|`|9kKgasQcaa	They probably want more money. Or they just eatin your food.|`|Xzdyz8Kiaa	I've never been there and thanks to you will never go.<br>  <br>  We must ban together against the man (or Panda).|`|bCudUSvtaa	Probably because portion sizes in America are RIDICULOUS.  It's absolutely crazy to see how they have changed over the years and how out of control they are in comparison to other places in the world.  Look up a recommended portion size in relation to the fat, calories, and sodium that's in the food and you'll probably realize why you don't get or need such a large portion...
