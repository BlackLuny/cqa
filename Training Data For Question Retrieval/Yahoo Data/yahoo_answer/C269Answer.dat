KaKtCdVZaa	Try putting on happy or calming music. <br>  Make sure to stop and reread your work to see if the characters still in character.<br>  Avoid horror scenes and when you see your writing morbid things go back and fix it.<br>  I would recommend to not force yourself to write something you don't want to though.|`|mE1YiekAaa	i've written one and am working on another. <br>  my friend goes fanfic crazy and has written i think over 15 lol but i'm a one shot writer and she does chapters with her ocs<br>  i write about couple fandoms i'm into (i.e. sasunaru and sasodei is my fav)<br>  it's quite simple really. just think about what you wanna write, put a candle on, take a bath, anything to make you relax. then do something like play with playdough, or chewing fum really helps to get those creative juices flowing :D <br>  a story line should fly write on into your brain :) but remeber that when you have an idea you gotta hold on to it tightly, so write it down befor you forget it :)<br>  happy writeing!|`|hxoawGwZaa	Well.. basically I write about Naruto (KakaSaku) and Bleach (IchiRuki) and my inspiration comes from the anime itself, it's like I watch it and think "What would happen if something went like this way?" and other things like that but what helps me big time is when I put a song that means so much to me or a song that I've heard for the first time and I liked it, this way the inspiration stays fresh.<br>  <br>  And since I prefer to write Angst/Romance stories, it suits well with the way I imagine things.<br>  <br>  And of course, you have to write about what you like and what you know about most so that the characters would stay In-Character. Also, read your work a couple of times after you finish writing to check if you have any spelling,grammer mistakes or to make sure that you're kept the characters "In-Character".

lDBI2PoWaa	Personally I liked it, but I had not read the book so I didn't have super high expectations of it or my own idea how the characters should look or act.  Yes, it is a pretty corny movie but not bad by any means.|`|7lDsUXEmaa	The books are really interesting! If you love like mystery, then you will love this book. You don't know whats gonna happen next. Now the movie wasn't the best but its not that bad. Yes, it need some more directing but i dont think the character that played Bella should have played that part. But the books are expensive so you can even try to read it online or if you have an ipod you can have a translator game so it can read it to you. Its pretty good!|`|56bNLJykaa	No, I am sure the books are better. If you care about "quality" then that is not the movie you want to see.|`|240e85ac1f26271b71217ebbf8ba3a79aa	I absolutely love the Twilight novel series... but Twilight the movie sucked so bad that I honestly wanted to cry.<br>  <br>  Although the movie really sucked, I guess it won't stop me from watching the other movies coming out because I'm a real die-hard fan of Twilight..<br>  <br>  So by watching the movie, I'm really just supporting the novel series.|`|CgwEfwOZaa	i thought it was a really good movie.  <br>  <br>  i think people either hate it completely or love it.  there's no inbetween with this one.|`|9z5YJKqLaa	yes, i do<br>  <br>  movie sucked. but what do you expect, it was based on a horrible series|`|SiPGcBnYaa	'good' is not the right word.<br>  a better word is....SUCKS|`|5iicqLAcaa	Honestly. Yes. <br>  It is always important, though, to remember that no movie will ever match the book 100%. So, if you're one of those people who can't stand for a movie and book to match, then it may not be for you. <br>  Also, Summit Entertainment didn't think Twilight would gross as well as it did and it is therefore a low budget movie. But, regardless, I went and saw it twice in one night. I loved it! lol.|`|00O15J7haa	i personally think it was horrible and nothing like the book. anyone who would see the movie before reading the book would think the book was a stupid weird and lame. i hated it.|`|uKnO6t9vaa	some people hated it, but i liked it. if you didn't read the book, i can't think of many reasons why you'd dislike it.<br>  the acting is a bit awkward in certain ways, because the actors are all sort of awkward people.<br>  <br>  the soundtrack...is amazing.|`|MuPxWmJhaa	Very awesome story. But BAD MOVIE. horrible. bad acting, directing, but read the books!|`|1jWNcJDVaa	If you HAVE read the book then .. YES!!!<br>  if you HAVE NOT read the book then.. NOO!!!|`|RPxtXK2yaa	NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|CIhpkxGyaa	no|`|1a1fc7850a41950081401eac4b686d4aaa	Please read this review - see what you think:<br>  <a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4507" rel="nofollow">http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4507</a>
upTcPaAyaa	Scream trilogy are great so I'm really looking forward to the fourth movie. When he said younger version he meant that this movie is potentially will have a new set of young casts and the old casts like Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and David Arquette will probably only get a cameo role in the new installment.|`|XCVFEAC8aa	It means it's gonna have a new cast!<br>  Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and David Arquette supposedly is gonna appear in it, but just as a cameo role!<br>  <br>  I can't wait, cause I miss GhostFace! :(|`|JzYlReESaa	The idea of a new Scream movie is interesting but really, i wish they would just leave it alone. 1, 2 &  3 where awesome. and three tied it up really well. I have to say though that Kevin Willianson is the ****!!|`|ObVYg0iRaa	where did you hear about this???

OF4FiIKPaa	I own the dvd.  The name of the song is "Tranquilized", performed by the group Inhaler.  Sorry it took so long to answer.  Had to research a number of sites due to lack of band's activity on the internet.  I couldn't find a website for this band and their My Space page seems to have been deleted.  That's the bad news but the good news is that someone uploaded a video of the song you are looking for on YouTube.  I will include the link just in case you want to listen to it freely.  Peace out.  <br>  <br>  YouTube link: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhVzia36J0k" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhVzia36J...</a>  <br>  <br>  P.S. If you really want the full soundtrack list let me know.  It consists of 41 different songs, but I'll post it if you want it.

1H7MoHLtaa	Wow this is so tough.  He is definitely the best living actor today in my book.  I'm also torn between Gangs Of New York and My Left Foot.  I'm sure most people will say There Will Be Blood, which was a great film and a great performance as well.<br>  <br>  Overall I'll go with Gangs of New York I guess.  Although it may not qualify as the best overall film of his, the performance he gives is beyond amazing.  Bill is one of the greatest character ever depicted on film in my book.  That accent alone was just pure greatness.|`|ScZPVCUpaa	My Left Foot, just brilliant.<br>  But also, he was great in Room with a View as a total geek.|`|56bNLJykaa	Personally I thought There Will Be Blood. Then Gangs of New York.. My Left Foot was also good|`|zUT4ZeM6aa	He is such big and creative actor so it was very difficult to decide.

AA12330289	Hey there, I was wondering the same thing! However, I'm extremely puzzled at the moment, seeing as if you visit their Myspace our beloved Australian Street Team can be found in their Top Friends, but, we don't have any of their CDs in any stores... Sad, right?<br>  Well, if they are going to come it'll only make sense if they release their new album here as well as the other countries. I think they should be coming, they were actually here in Australia some time last year, because a friend of mine actually met them! Anyway, let's hope that they do come, it would be a major disappointment if they didn't otherwise =(<br>  <br>  Good to hear from another Aussie TH fan + I hope I was of help to you.<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|SkFgDxpEaa	"as of now they have no concert scheduled past July or August of 2008. they are in germany right now finishing their 1000 hotels tour. they said once their are finished with their tour they are heading into the studio to begin working on a new album. they said they hope to do a full US to promote their new cd when it comes out!! i cannot wait!!! hope this helps"

94zi1LFFaa	you're on a cusp sara.. read about both gemini & cancerian to determine for yourself which ~feels~ more like yourself.. & that is the sign you mostly are... you & maybe those very close to you are the only one/ones who can answer that... you'll always be affected by both signs regardless...<br>  <br>  ~peace|`|9LzlIgoJaa	gemini|`|d9hzMrzwaa	your probably a gemini|`|47l1Sumeaa	You're a Gemini-Cancer cusp. This means that you are most likely to display traits of both signs. It depends on the year and the time of your birth. You should look up the time you were born and find out from there.|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Gemini - 5/21 - 6/21<br>  You are a Gemini.|`|ITiuIb1Waa	gemini May 21-June 21|`|AA11417199	Gemini - Goat <br>  <br>  The Gemini/Goat is a firefly who flits about in others' lives out of sheer caprice; a tired pessimist who denigrates and disagrees with the world at large; or perhaps he's the eternally disappointed critic whose longing for perfection (in others, of course) leads him to drop acerbic comments as though they were rose petals. The Gemini/Goat is a bit of a lot of different things. You won't find many Goats running around loose. Goats need other people. All Goats require both company and guiding forces. Gemini is the mercurial sign: quick, volatile, fickle. So put these together. Dependency and fickleness. Like a smiling, chubby baby who's looking around for a change from his dull parents and leaps into the arms of almost anybody who passes his stroller in the street. Obviously, this versatile person makes a fabulous - if temporary - lover. When they find themselves in bed with one, they may well be thinking of the next or the last great lovemaking session. Butterflies in bed, they can think up the most ingenious sex games and... <br>  <br>  Famous Gemini Goats - John Wayne, Brook Shields, Arthur Conan Doyle...<br>  <br>  Good Compatibilities - Aries Cat...|`|szJ7bxIjaa	You're what's called a "cusp baby". It means you were born on either the last day or first day of a sign. You're a pretty special individual, as it means that you can be defined by both and neither of the gemini and cancer traits. I'm the same way- I was born on Sept. 24th, so while I'm technically a Libra, I still have a lot of Virgo traits as well. Does that make sense?|`|sIJ6jxNdaa	you are gemini but you may have a lot of cancer traits like my friend she was born january 19 ok she is a capricorn but she had a lot of aquarius traits|`|7d8c1771b3e187721692240addac4a9baa	if you were born before 4:20 P.M. you're gemini. now if you were born after 4:20 P.M. then, you're cancer.
FBE6xLFLaa	wear tight shoes they tend to come off and get lost<br>  a light comfortable shirt, its really hott<br>  and a pair of comfortable jeans <br>  hair in a pony tail <br>  lots and lots of deoderant<br>  and no hoodies they will get lost along with headbands, and<br>  dont take a purse keep your money in a very tight pocket<br>  <br>  once you lose something you will most likely not get it back<br>  <br>  i lost my shoes and Warped Tour and found them between bands, <br>  <br>  they hurt really bad, and be very careful<br>  i saw this one guy come out of one and his whole back was covered in blood, look out for crowd surfers cuz they hurt when they land on your head. and be aware of flyin body parts they come from every direction|`|STeK38kgaa	Honestly, expect the worse. Etiquette? No such thing. Think of it like a street fight but with music. Wear clothes that you don't care about if they get absolutely trashed. Best case scenario you'll end up with a few bruises. Worst Case scenario some broken bones. Been in enough mosh pits i've learned to just stay the hell away from them.|`|GJQ164gHaa	wear shorts and a t-shirt. be careful of people stealing your clothse too. They'll steal the clothse right off ur back! wear tight fitting shoes|`|8jQ3FBpAaa	i've been to a mosh pit, so here's what you need to do (1)wear clothes you don't care about in case you get blood, dirt, sweat on it or if it rips.(2)bring brass knuckles or nun chucks in case you have to take down some one. and (3) be prepared to get into fights and perhaps die.|`|kEuVNTm1aa	converse are fine. lol<br>  <br>  leave your phone and other stuff in your car. hide your keys under your car in a certain place or tie it to your shoe so you dont get stabbed in your pocket lol.
xNYUtmh8aa	Because Rolling stone magazine is F***ing retarded|`|WU4MHq3aaa	are you sh!tting me???<br>  <br>  check again<br>  <br>  if some person like.... OutKast is in there... IMA BE PIIIIISSSED!|`|wl1wVZ4Haa	Queen is top 30 easily.|`|89xzNpVaaa	Are you sure? I think you should check again, it should be there.<br>  But anyway, Rolling Stone sucks, what do they know much about music?<br>  They don't even know how hard and how talented that artist has to be or is, and just judge them.|`|y1xPK3Txaa	The Rolling Stones drops the ball with every list they make.<br>  <br>  They are the VH1 of magazines.|`|OLCoFKQraa	The only people dumber than the ones writing those stupid lists are the people who read them and take it seriously.|`|5cCIDpGfaa	If queen isn't on there I'm pretty sure Freddie is alteast|`|5g0zCTqMaa	Queen was a truly an amazing band but one of their key reasons for not placing them as on of the 100 greatest artists because of their lack of cd's due to Freddie Mercury's untimely death. I too am quite enraged that Queen isn't on the list as well as the Red Hot Chili Peppers and I am quite offended that the band discovered by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nirvana, was on the list. In my opinion the list is bogus and looks very sloppy. Honestly, how can you call the guitarist of a band one of the top 3 in the world, John Mayer, John Frusciante, and Derek Trucks, one year but then make a list of the 100 greatest bands and not place them on it. Blasphemy is what it is truly and utterly ridiculous so many deserving bands were left out I truly feel your pain. Seriously, Muddy Waters? Who the hell is that haha. The Beastie Boys?! REALLY?! Wow! And who the fu*k are The Yardbirds?! The list seriously needs to be revised I'm right with you on this one. Oh and there are many more artists I find questionable on the list but too many to list im appalled as you are. Rolling Stone has lost alot of credibility purely because of this list, at least to me.|`|130248949e94757105ea49b6b66816d6aa	I agree with all of you who said that Rolling Stone sucks. That magazine does everything in its power to underrate Queen! Have you checked their 500 best songs list? They put only 2 Queen songs there: Bohemian Rhapsody and We will rock you. Those songs really deserve to be on that list, but there are many other songs that should be there. And on their 500 greatest albums list, there is only one Queen album: A Night At The Opera. It is so obvious that they don't respect Queen and I would really like to know why that is. You should take a look at this:  <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/queen/albums/album/195592/review/5942056/jazz" rel="nofollow">http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/quee...</a><br>  What are they trying to accomplish with those horrible articles? It is possible that they attack Queen because it is a band form England, but they aren't spitting on other british bands.Whatever is the cause,  I'll keep saying that Rolling Stone is a horrible magazine until they stop doing that.|`|JzYlReESaa	I doubt they arn't in there but if what you say is true.<br>  ROLLING STONE is snubbing them because they are not American, the same thing happens at the Oscars.<br>  Everyone knows American rock is great, but Britain is where iconic rock truely lives.<br>  <br>  David Bowie<br>  The Rolling Stones<br>  The Beatles<br>  Queen<br>  Led Zeppelin<br>  ACDC (Australia)<br>  Elton John<br>  <br>  Eat dat mudda phukkasss!!|`|7bfeb01febfb4a15cf89709e49e3db8baa	Rolling Stone magazine has always looked down on Queen. Read their reviews for the Queen albums.You can see the hate stems from there al;ready.|`|WfUMOPyhaa	because Rolling Stone doesn't realize that Queen is amazing
A9iACNrSaa	It's an older television show. People probably don't watch it as much as they used to, and therefore, the ratings have gone down. If the show doesn't generate much viewer feedback, its useless to show the show much longer. That's why Friends went bye-bye, and Everybody Loves Raymond...:(|`|8uHQngbNaa	Relax, "Wings" is coming back.|`|x1HoSdYTaa	The guy who plays Monk is old. Ratings are down. People complain cuz he hasn't caught his wife's killer. They are ready for Monk to catch the killer, and move on in life.|`|VBCxQo8taa	The show probably has low ratings.

School was boring (except 7th period which is da bomb!). Waited around about an hour after school to get picked up. and came come and sat at my computer screen...

TyydcRfeaa	Die Hard has been the one of the best action films of all time. Very well written, hilarious moments with Bruce, & over the top scenes to pump your adrenaline. Still most were disappointed with the previous movie, Die Hard With A Vengeance. I enjoyed it but some critics were skeptical about Bruce and Samuel L. Jackson, plus the story not being enriched with smart terrorism. That has all changed with Live Free Or Die Hard. Bruce Willis returns as Detective Jon McClaine, still divorced, still complaining about his life, and having complications communicating with his teenage daughter. The movie starts of well, starting with the main story about a group of highly skilled hackers diving into the F.B.I.'s Cyber Security Center. When things begin not to work at the Center, the head of the department wants every possible hacker to be brought into D.C. for questioning. In comes the hero, asked by the feds to bring in Matthew Farell, played by the funny Justin Long, A sarcastic but smart hacker who has been in trouble with the F.B.I. before. As soon as Willis arrives to Long's apartment, the action begins. I can't really explain anymore on the story. What I will tell you is, its worth every dime to sit in the theater. It catches you the moment the action begins. Very well written like the first two, hilarious moments with not just Bruce but with Justin as well, and one hell of a ride. The reason it has an 8 though is the fact that it won't appeal to everyone.|`|tLI94qWNaa	Shooter <br>  Death race <br>  Righteous kill<br>  Eagle eye <br>  Max payne <br>  Bangkok dangerous<br>  <br>  The only one I like out of these would be Righteous kill, that was an amazing movie.

I have always sort of liked Chloe, im not into the goody goodies on the show esp since i really hate lily.I was hoping that chloe and Cane would really hit it off, he looked so happy with the baby, and he was so nice to chloe...any other storyline they would drag it out for months on end but now , it looks as if cane and lily(yawn) will be back together|`|cce7d68825e6be23ab1dbad4e0df262faa	Actually yes she can play the bad girl extremely well and she can also be sweet and nice and yes Cane is the better father I think he's going to keep the baby anyway it looks that way and yes I am a Chloe fan even if its not the popular choice!|`|2f8d927b404e673e434c880af431f65caa	I hope now that she`s a mother, she`ll stop her conniving ways and raise her daughter with dignity.

5dMw30kMaa	I think starting with steel is better because it'll build up the callouses and strength in your fingers faster. It'll be tough at first but eventually it'll pay off :D|`|cC3ISyQsaa	Well it depends on what you like, what sounds better to you, and what feels more comfortable. I suggest trying both before you decide. I use steel, because I like the sound better, even though it makes my fingers callous quicker than nylon.|`|UuEpPMltaa	to start off with steel string guitars might be too hard on your fingers, until you build up calluses. it would probably be better to start on nylon so you can get a feel for it|`|wQ8qTC8Faa	I would suggest getting a steel stringed guitar. It builds up callus and if you wanted to move to electric guitar it would be easier.

mYxvDgVxaa	It depends if you're talking about the album or the single.<br>  The album went #1 way back in December and is currently somewhere in the 20's. So I highly doubt it.<br>  The song is facing very tough competition, for her to be #1 she would have to have many many digital downloads and tons of airplay. Digital downloads are crazy right now for others. She's somewhere around position 15 right now so I don't see it going #1.|`|MVgm17o3aa	I believe so, it's a fun song.|`|eNR2iot8aa	I don't think this one will go to number 1 she has better songs on the album than th|`|gYyW39wTaa	yes

XQvLV5imaa	hahaha -- no no no!  You see, Ed was all cross-eyed...<br>  He ate Scar single-handedly, thinking he was a gazelle or something. Didn't you see the look on his face??|`|BHpELpEqaa	yeah they did|`|9g2OAB8Maa	Yeah. They were tired of his ways and now that they had Simba as king they had no more need for Scar.<br>  They pretty much ate him alive. Gross, I know, but they couldn't show that in a Disney movie. I think the way they showed it was okay, though. =)|`|RXBb8kx7aa	Yes. Yes they did. He was eaten alive. Disney has quite a few gorey and/or grotesque deaths of thier villians. Ursula was impaled by a friggin galleon. The bad guy in Mulan was shot into a building full of fireworks and fried. Clayton from Tarzan was hung to death after falling through a tangled mess of vines after a fight with the hero. Sleeping Beauty, we watch the witch/dragon be run through with a sword (a bit more traditional and not considered as extreme, but still...). Snow White, the witch is pretty much pushed off a cliff to her celebrated demise. Who framed Roger Rabbit (hmm... might be Warner Bros, not disney) the villian was melted in a form of acid for cartoon characters. Cartoons have some pretty graphic stuff and Disney is surprisingly vivid. Interesting how children's cartoons depict such images.|`|5d5d03879d88748bb42d13bf3c0010a5aa	why not? hyenas have been known to kill lions, although its a rare occurance, and I dont think theyd just waste a perfectly good carcass<br>  <br>  and thus, as Mufasa explained to a young Simba, the circle of life is complete|`|QjgxH7Ouaa	Of course they did!~  They pounced on him and tore the flesh from his bones.|`|946a0de98c140058626f3f700cfaa468aa	yes they did.  They ripped him to shreds.|`|f1pb2Vlaaa	Well that's what was implied, but it's not for sure. Since it was like 1992, and a Disney movie, it was pretty hard to show stuff like that. But seeing the way the all converged on him and the like, I'm guessing yes. Pretty disturbing if you think about it.
pCzO6T45aa	first of all it was fly khicks tht did the bike thing, and second of all, they juss record the performances twice. once while they rehearse and once again at the taping, and then they edit it and put it all together|`|57lRL4elaa	It's possible. I know they do it on American Idol so that they can do the recaps and replays at the end of the show.
wTkvkWscaa	I've wondered this, too.<br>  <br>  "(In) the beginning, we hear Elliott's lone voice struggling to rise over the clamor of street urchins, dealers, etc., (it) paints for us a truly vivid and wrenchingingly painful picture from his memories of what we imagine are so many late night, back alley moments."<br>  <br>  That's what somebody said on song meanings. This song is beautifuly sad. These lyrics are some of my favorite lyrics every written.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Also, something interesting about this song that I learned recently; whenever Elliott would play this song live, his then girlfriend would shout "Because I love you!" at the part where he says "Give me one good reason not to do it". So he had it recorded that way.|`|jIyvb2OOaa	The king's crossing was the main attraction<br>  Dominos are falling in a chain reaction<br>  The scraping subject ruled by fear told me<br>  Whiskey works better than beer<br>  <br>  The judge is on vinyl, decisions are final<br>  And nobody gets a reprieve<br>  And every wave is tidal<br>  If you hang around<br>  You're going to get wet<br>  <br>  I can't prepare for death any more than I already have<br>  All you can do now is watch the shells<br>  The game looks easy, that's why it sells<br>  Frustrated fireworks inside your head<br>  Are going to stand and deliver talk instead<br>  The method acting that pays my bills<br>  Keeps the fat man feeding in Beverly Hills<br>  I got a heavy metal mouth that hurls obscenity<br>  And I get my check from the trash treasury<br>  Because I took my own insides out<br>  <br>  It don't matter because I have no sex life<br>  All I want to do now is inject my ex-wife<br>  I've seen the movie<br>  And I know what happens<br>  <br>  It's Christmas time<br>  And the needles on the tree<br>  A skinny Santa is bringing something to me<br>  His voice is overwhelming<br>  But his speech is slurred<br>  And I only understand every other word<br>  Open your parachute and grab your gun<br>  Falling down like an omen, a setting sun<br>  Read the part and return at five<br>  It's a hell of a role if you can keep it alive<br>  But I don't care if I **** up<br>  I'm going on a date<br>  With a rich white lady<br>  Ain't life great?<br>  Give me one good reason not to do it<br>  (Because we love you)<br>  So do it<br>  <br>  This is the place where time reverses<br>  Dead men talk to all the pretty nurses<br>  Instruments shine on a silver tray<br>  Don't let me get carried away<br>  Don't let me get carried away<br>  Don't let me be carried away
ioNTTqKfaa	They are both classics.

My Favorite songs to write is breakup songs, cause you can get out all your anger and stuff!!!!<br>  I thinkn I am going to be a singer when I grow up, it has always been a dream of mine.

Those scars are terrible and I hope she heals fast.|`|Uu0ROfuPaa	I don't think anyone supports him because of what he did... but I know a lot of people still like him.<br>  <br>  Its not right what he did... but he is a good artist<br>  <br>  I feel the same way... before I thought he just hit her once because she can be a "*****" from what people say<br>  But after the picture... I was shocked!|`|KXf0ZcVNaa	I still like Chris Brown and his music, i heard that it all kicked off because rihanna slept with jay-z and he gave her herpes and she gave chris herpes i would be pretty mad if i was in his position so now Jay-Z,Rihanna,Chris Brown and Beyonce hae herpes|`|sHL4wRMNaa	i think they are both messed up. NO ONE KNows what happened but them right now. there is NO reason to ever hit anyone period, a girl to a guy or vice versa. and it doesn't matter if its a slap or a beating. u don't touch others that way...period. he needs help and so does she. i'm sure this wasn't the first time. i don't think much of CB to start with but i think that this has ruinned him...and people are going to crush him for it. cuz he beat up RR, and they should. it's super sad what happeend. but the reality is women date beaters and stay with beaters, this one is huge cuz they are celebs.|`|qMUxjvQsaa	ok i still like him but like come on rhianna is a bit*h and she i think deserved it and i mean she put this on herself and he does have an anger problem|`|8118e5dc5860c44897f5b576d6daf893aa	I no longer support chris brown at all. i'm so unbelievably disappointed in him :(|`|56dfvnwmaa	I agree. all the feminists should be protesting against his music.<br>  <br>  ok I admit it, I just dont like his singing at all whatsoever and would be glad to see his career go up in smoke|`|jfEOIeSIaa	Not at all. he should be put in jail for attempted murder. that piece of $hit shell of a man.

1NtdXwGKaa	nice*<br>  <br>  heres my joke:<br>   A man was driving home late one afternoon, and he was driving above the speed limit. He looks in his rear view mirror and notices a police car with its red lights. He thinks, "I can outrun this guy", so he floors it. <br>  <br>  The cars are racing down the highway - 60, 70, 80, 90 miles an hour. Finally, as his speedometer passes 100, the guy realizes he can't outrun the cop so he gives up and pulls over to the curb. <br>  <br>  The police officer gets out of his cruiser and approaches the car. He leans down and says "Listen mister, I've had a really lousy day, and I just want to go home.

HmXViQipaa	I have seen it and was shocked!!!!<br>  I think its "Sick" that other countries have this great health care and ours sucks ***! WTF? We are so Great uh? We are the SuperPower? That's just it..They want to keep the poor poor..while the rich get richer. Don't get me wrong, I don't believe in the whole "spreading the wealth around" thing!!! If a man worked hard and earned it..it's his..not mine! But I feel every human being deserves the right to health care, food, and shelter! These things should be considered Basic Human Rights (even if you live in a cardboard box)! The U.S. does not have Health Care on that list. Here, doctors and the government are in bed with the FDA, pharmaceutical companies, and insurance companies.  Their playing all sides! There would be no money to be made if Health Care were universal! Just count all the Drug Ads you see on T.V. Everyone is making something. If health care were universal, those ads would nearly vanish. I don't know how the other countries have managed to do it, but they have!|`|UhXTWNKZaa	i think its a disgusting piece of liberal lies<br>  he went to cuba to prove their health care was better?<br>  wtf? their people starve! communism doesnt work!|`|DWeGV8Akaa	i think america is doing pretty good with their health insurance but i know youre pretty cute|`|ZleVRevVaa	I haven't seen it, but i will|`|GIxctDDuaa	havent seen it|`|UQWusO1waa	visit cuba and find out, moore thinks its the best.|`|wl1wVZ4Haa	I loved it.

ClRuPRs7aa	Here's a great joke! (might be based on a real story idk)<br>  <br>  It was at the end of the school year, and a kindergarten teacher was receiving gifts from her pupils. The florist's son handed her a gift. She shook it, held it overhead, and said, "I bet I know what it is. Some flowers." "That's right" the boy said, "but how did you know?" "Oh, just a wild guess," she said. <br>  <br>  The next pupil was the candy shop owner's daughter. The teacher held her gift overhead, shook it, and said, "I bet I can guess what it is. A box of sweets." "That's right, but how did you know?" asked the girl. "Oh, just a wild guess," said the teacher. <br>  <br>  The next gift was from the son of the liquor store owner. The teacher held the package overhead, but it was leaking. She touched a drop of the leakage with her finger and touched it to her tongue. "Is it wine?" she asked. "No," the boy replied, with some excitement. <br>  <br>  The teacher repeated the process, taking a larger drop of the leakage to her tongue. "Is it champagne?" she asked. "No," the boy replied, with more excitement. The teacher took one more taste before declaring, "I give up, what is it?" With great glee, the boy replied, "It's a puppy!"|`|VSfiigz3aa	a clown?|`|L3VbnH1faa	once i touched a pot and started screaming 'ow ow! mom i burned my hand" and then my mom touched the pot and told me that it wasn't even hot.|`|ca0f5a47cf09cbd5e44eadcb861c8819aa	Well i've done alot of things that have been funny, but not too appropriate.

An adventure without sufficient action would be like watching a business man get to work-you know, no real challenges, just a lot of monotonous motion. On the flip side, action without an adventure would seem a little pointless. What's the point of the action if there is no ultimate goal in the end?|`|1OpE0zrDaa	Well i like both but i will say this i prefer action with Romance or adventure with a little comedy, i really perfer action to answer your question so if u need to ask a question tell me i would love to help and so does my girlfriend (she really loves to help people) so Bye <br>  <br>  p.s my girl friend said she your code geass pic =)|`|X3dtdrLkaa	hey~!<br>  <br>  i like em both .. whats an adventure with some action~!<br>  <br>  i cant really pick one .. sorry ;p  <br>  <br>  P.S<br>  i dont like so much action the one with the blood and assasination, i like it on real live movies instead of animes ..<br>  <br>  Bye~!|`|jZVtnt9gaa	Adventure!

There are more talented musicians out there, but they can sing, they can play, and they make music people like to listen to. That's what music is all about, making what people like to hear.

l6Kii2Uiaa	3 men go into a hotel to check in for a conference and get a room to freshen up in. The man behind the desk said the room is $30, so each man paid $10 and went to the room.  <br>  <br>  A while later the man behind the desk realized the room was only $25, so he sent the bellboy to the 3 guys' room with $5 leftover. On the way the bellboy couldn't figure out how to split $5 evenly between 3 men, so he gave each man a $1 and kept the other $2 for himself. This meant that the 3 men each paid $9 for the room, which is a total of $27; add the $2 that the bellboy kept = $29.  <br>  <br>  Where is the other dollar?

Lois had always been full of energy and life, but lately I had begun to grow more aware of her aging. The bright, exuberant eyes that I had fallen in love with were now beginning to grow dull and listless with the long fatigue of a weary life.

Plus she's a great actor.|`|PJqIvsjyaa	no. shes pretty annoying. shes like a selena gomez wannabe. she has nothing unique to her and she tries to be the next disney teen queen but she will not succeed. and the youtube videos she makes? puh-lease. most of them are copies of miley/ mandy or selena/ demi.<br>  <br>  and is it just me or is her voice EXACTLY like selenas. freaky...|`|W8SgRKo7aa	yeah, she is hot, cute, funny and talented<br>  oh!...<br>   and did i forget to mention hot!?|`|iJXFZx7taa	I DOES NAWT CARES.<br>  <br>  YAH.|`|dejqLjaLaa	she's alright.|`|rl6MRtVWaa	Yeah, she's really talented :)

And she wouldn't do it because of her fans.<br>  I agree that she is a good Rosalie though, she's pretty, blonde, haha.<br>  <br>  Yeah. On her Youtube video she acts with her friends, there's one where she is in the dentist getting her retainer, its so funny.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zymq4JgQ7E" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zymq4JgQ...</a><br>  <br>  And there's more when she's with her friends.

Most singers can act if they do music videos that need acting involved.
vDGFRACaaa	I don't want to repeat everyone else, so she's not the "brightest" of all movie villains, but: Sarah Michelle Gellar from Cruel Intentions.<br>  <br>  Just plain wicked. She gets dumped by some guy and her revenge is to turn his girlfriend into a smut, then she tortures her step-brother by making him fall in love with Reese Witherspoon and then dump her.

I do not even tolerate one disrespectful word from a man, he is gone. Any woman who allows a man to beat her is as big a coward as he is, and seriously if you think he loves you, you need the psych ward yesterday.
Tja1NM78aa	Debussy - his music is incredibly elegant in a French sort of way. <br>  Clair de Lune is great but slightly overdone...all of his piano works are great and so difficult to play.<br>  Also love Vivaldi because who doesn't?|`|aMYnswakaa	My personal favorite is the Sibelius Violin Concerto in D. Heartbreakingly beautiful. I've played violin for 10 years and never have I come across a piece that even comes close to matching it :D|`|whWA5DvWaa	Song?

6dAsdiA5aa	Ciaossu!<br>  Have you try Katekyou Hitman Reborn! yet? Coz it's really cool! The manga is better than the anime... in my opinion ^^<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --- KATEKYOU HITMAN REBORN! ---<br>  <br>  KHR! is about a boy named Tsunayoshi Sawada [Tsuna] who is a total loser (studies, sports, girls, life >.>) & nicknamed 'No Good Tsuna' [Dame Tsuna]. He has zero friends & dang hopeless -__-<br>  <br>  One day, a very strong infant named Reborn, who is a hitman from Italy, comes to him & tells him that he will be the 10th generation boss of a Mafia family, the infamous Vongola Family & he will train him to become an admirable Mafia boss. At first, Tsuna refuses to do anything related to the Mafia, but then, he gains lots of friends & when danger comes, he is willing to risk himself for the sake of others. In the earlier episodes, you may not find Tsuna interesting coz he had to rely on the ‘Dying Will Bullet’ to get strong, but as the story gets deeper, Tsuna changed & totally FTW!!! XD<br>  <br>  You should read the manga too. There are some differences between the manga & anime, like, in the anime, they didn’t show Longchamp Naito & too much blood. The charries there bleed a lot where fighting but yeah, the anime version didn’t show it… -__-“”<br>  <br>  <br>  It's really cool coz it has both comedy & action- typical shounen. There is a little romance too.  All the guys there totally kickass like, Gokudera Hayato (weapon: dynamites), Yamamoto Takeshi (weapon: katana), Hibari Kyoya (weapon: tonfas), Rokudo Mukuro & Chrome Dokuro (weapon: Trident & Illusions), Sasagawa Ryohei (weapon: his fists.. he's a boxer), Lambo (weapon: able to control thunder, 10-Year Bazooka), Sawada Tsuna (weapon: X-Gloves. Dang his weapon is the coolest!!! XD)<br>  <br>  I already make my cousin (who makes fun of KHR! at first) & a few Contacts to watch KHR! and now they are totally ADDICTED to it.

Have you heard of Berserk? If not, your really missing out. It's an amazing epic seinen manga. I have trouble finding anything bad to say about it.<br>  <br>  The manga itself is set in medieval Europe, and the art is just stunning; each panel is a masterpiece. <br>  <br>  The only caveat I  have in recommending Berserk, is that it is extremely graphic in violence, gore, sex, and other very adult situations. I do not recommend this manga for anyone under the age of 18.<br>  <br>  Another seinen manga which is underrated and very good is Hellsing. This manga is also quite violent, but not to the point of gore. It's about the vampire Alucard and the English Protestants fighting off Nazi vampire and werewolf remnants as well as the forces of the Vatican. The series is finished as of a few months ago so you won't have to wait.<br>  <br>  If you need help locating either of these manga I can try to help you.<br>  <br>  I hope I was of some aid to you.|`|sDIjPUnBaa	Hey, Vampire Knight you listed is good, which I am reading now,<br>  But my fav is Rave Master.

Wi0LBsVbaa	Liszt was inspired by Paganini. Franz lived in an age of no TV or radio and practiced at least 8 hours a day. Today, no one is playing piano in his league. It may seem odd, but I think the only performer to become as able to exploit his instrument, in the same fashion, in recent times, was Jimi Hendrix.<br>  (Hey, it's just a opinion based on what I know).|`|ThKkn5fKaa	Not really, because not only was Liszt a great composer, he was also perhaps the greatest pianist in the world during his time.  And there are only two other human beings whom I would put into that category: Beethoven and Rachmaninoff.|`|Mo28yaPoaa	Richard Kastle has been shamelessly self promoting himself via youtube as the greatest interpretee of Liszt.|`|PoTwN4mmaa	Leslie Howard-Recorded ALL of Liszt's solo piano works.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	If Mr. Tumnus would have followed Lucy back through the wardrobe, he would have been amazed and probably a little traumatized at the whole shift in worlds - but Professor Digory would have known what he was, as Digory entered Narnia himself on its day of Creation. Digory would have made sure Mr. Tumnus got back to Narnia. We know that Narnians can enter our world (somewhat) as Caspian came through with Eustace and Jill for a short time (although he was, technically, dead) - Aslan told him that he could no longer want "wrong things".|`|GBOgsAoDaa	i dont think that mr.

The beat is sick and Dre's verse is sick.. Em coulda did 1001823029483284 times of a better hook that would still be catchy than that B.S.! That beat deserves a nasty hook, not such a silly one. But hey, other than that, I'm glad Dre's back rappin and it's a pretty good jam even though the hook ruins it a lot. I just wish I could change that hook... uff, my dad even likes it and he's in his 50s. It's just so catchy, that's why... but hey, that's how they make their money.  If all the records they put out were gangsta they wouldn't get radio play so they have to make club bangas, love songs, silly songs.. ones that are catchy. Some of the songs on Em's first album were some of the illest ish I've heard.. I was feelin that track he put out just a little while ago about stickin his pee pee in a mannequin's ***. I don't know the name of it.. "The medicine is makin my hands a little shakier.. hand me that 18 month old baby to shake em up.. it'll only take me a second to break his trachea"...

I just can't remember which one I listened to more recently for the first time ...<br>  <br>  Last one I hated: Honestly, I usually find SOMETHING to like on almost every album I listen to. I guess maybe "Trout Mask Replica" by Captain Beefheart. And I didn't hate that as much as I just didn't GET it. And I tried really hard.|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	Last album I loved: Obzen by Meshuggah.

I love lip syncing to this album in my bathroom. Don't tell anyone.<br>  hated: We the Kings' self titled. The music's not too awful...it doesn't make my ears bleed like some, but the lyrics were bad (the love songs made me gag) and it just seemed very teeny boppery to me. And is it just me or are all pop-punk bands starting to sound exactly the same??|`|wcfsaAvOaa	Loved: Story Of The Year- Page Avenue<br>  I know it's pretty old, but it is very good. Highly recommend<br>  <br>  Hated: Taylor Swift-her newest one<br>  I know so many people loved it....I just didn't see it =|<br>  Yes, I listened to the entire album. I guess it wasn't my cup of soup.|`|Glk38Ml3aa	Loved: Red Jumpsuit Apparatus- Don't You Fake It<br>  <br>  Hated: Red Jumpsuit Apparatus- Lonely Road<br>  <br>  I really enjoyed listening to Don't you fake it so I went out and bought Lonely Road, major disapointment.

Keys set the archetype for R&B in this decade as many songs had strong lyrics about relationships & such. Although I never really liked all the songs on it, I have played the ones I did like at least over 50-60 times on Windows Media. It's probably my favourite of Keys' CDs, including "As I Am."<br>  <br>  I don't really h8 any CDs that I've purchased & listened 2. But I'm usually disappointed by a album if many of the tracks are boring & just not listen 2 the CD again. One good example is "Empty" & "Lose This Life" by Tait. I'm a dc Talk fan, so I buy a lot of the albums by the three dc Talk members as they've gone solo. So as a fan, I'm bummed out that the songs from Tait sounded as dull as a session rock band or something; I did not upload all the tracks on my computers or iPod & any songs that I liked a lil bit, either I deleted 'em eventually or I just never listened 2 'em (w/ a play count under 30).|`|5c6b99285c6b8893ed729455cb249619aa	There are so many crappy pop and rock albums that are nothing but the products of the recoding business that I don't really give pop and rock much of a chance anymore. <br>  <br>  Of the little that I have heard, in recent years, I have two albums that I really love.<br>  <br>  1. John Mayer's Continuum. Its really easy to dismiss him as another great haircut, BUT this album is really great. The band is great, and it's done in good taste. I think its one of the best pop albums ever made.<br>  <br>  2. Norah Jones album Feels Like Home. Her first album made her famous, and then she goes and puts out this low key album that sounds closer to the Band then it does to her first album. Just a great album from start to finish. <br>  <br>  I can't say I hate any new alums, just because I haven't heard any. I get repulsed by anything I hear on mainstream radio and the horrible monster that MTV is.<br>  <br>  The only connection I have to any pop and rock, on a regular basis is the guests on The David Letterman Show. Most of them are pretty boring.|`|LkN5nr6faa	Loved: Soilwork's 'Sworn to a Great Divide'. It's a great new album from a *fairly* old melodeath band. It's much better than In Flames's newest album 'A Sense of Purpose' IMO.<br>  <br>  Hated: Opeth's 'Watershed'. It's actually the album that made me refrain from checking out their older material until just recently, because I found 'Watershed' so boring.<br>  <br>  BA: NWOBHM

32Sdjnrlaa	The song is Right Round by Flo Rida. There's no music video for it yet, but here's a link to the song and lyrics on youtube.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpOptf64as0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpOptf64a...</a>
EhLYiIZ2aa	Yes, you're right, except for two points.<br>  <br>  For Fire/Air signs, they usually prefer acquaintances to best friends. In fact, I know two Air signs (one Gemini, one Aquarius) who don't believe in best friends. So while they are the most popular in large group, it's all made up of just acquaintances. They aren't really close to their clique, so to speak. <br>  <br>  For Water/Earth signs, they're much less sociable, but they believe strongly in having one or two best friends. They would devote all their time to their best friends, therefore, they have a smaller clique.|`|8DuQt1pTaa	It's not so much that some signs have a lot of friends and some have none.  The Fire/Air signs are the extroverts while the Earth/Water signs are more introverted.  That doesn't mean they can't have a lot of friends or are anti-social.  There is just a difference in the way the signs build and maintain friendships.  Plus, most people have a mix of positive and negative signs in their birth charts, so you can get anti-social Fire/Air signs and Earth/Water signs that are always the centre of attention.<br>  <br>  The stuff about Fire/Air signs only having acquaintances is bullsh*t, by the way.|`|wkPayZjbaa	Im the perfect example of how this can be wrong. My sign, is, as you say, negative. Im a virgo. But my moon is in gemini, my rising in sagittarius. (as well...i have A LOT more fire in my chart)..<br>  Im very bubbly, outgoing, spontaneous....everything you wouldnt expect in a virgo. It kinda goes to show you that not everything is how it seems...|`|JDFXHjMpaa	i dont know'zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz|`|uel6NBOVaa	No, it depends on the whole chart. Just looking at the elements alone this would be true, but it is not true for each person because we are made up of a number of elements and aspects. Someone can be an earth/water sign with a lot of fire/air influence and vice versa. Someone could also have a number of outgoing aspects that contribute to their personality. There are so many factors that you can't really divide it evenly. However, if you wanted to go by signs alone in their simplest forms, fire/air tend to be extraverts gaining energy from people, where as earth/water tend to prefer more one on one time or alone time, and gain their energy from looking inward. <br>  <br>  I'm an Air Sun, but I'm not all that "social". I don't care to have many acquaintances, and a night in by myself or with someone very close to me is all I really need.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Let's say you are a Pisces ( Water, Negative ) BUT you have a lot of Gemini and Leo in your chart, then you will be social. <br>  <br>  Now let's say you're a Gemini, BUT has a lot of earth and water in their chart. They will be more quiet and reserved. <br>  <br>  It depends on the whole chart.|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	Why is there such a value placed on being "social"? <br>  <br>  Once a person matures, "social" is not as important. <br>  <br>  I've never seen Earth and Water called "negative" for not being social enough. <br>  <br>  For everything, for every element, there must be balance. A person has to have both society and solitude. One is not better than the other.|`|S2uAq7i4aa	Yep.|`|QZzQdh43aa	yes, it's true|`|FIdA3FiCaa	no.
Mfixq1oyaa	"the only reason i speed is cuz i'm chasin the dream,<br>  and when i catch that *****, i'ma rape it and leave"<br>  <br>  <br>  Bite from lil wayne?<br>  <br>  Oh well besides that.<br>  <br>  One thing people do on here when they write lyrics is they dont stick to the topic. You talk about how your the best and they you talk about praying and cowards in the world.|`|3oUSroiZaa	It's pretty decent but you should probably finish the whole thing.
37qOjwDraa	They're the best death metal band ever. No exaggeration but no band could replace them. There are many bands out there who tries to but unfortunately, no one could. Though Bolt Thrower and Obituary kinda does.<br>  <br>  BA: Human, Scream Bloody Gore<br>  <br>  BA2: <br>  Crystal Mountain<br>  Suicide Machine<br>  Torn To Pieces<br>  See Through Dreams<br>  <br>  RIP Chuck|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	GREAT band!!!

In fact, unless melodeath counts, the only death metal band that I like is Carcass.<br>  <br>  BA: N/A<br>  BA2: N/A|`|M7E1uIsKaa	I like them, but I dont listen to them that much. I only have 1 album, The Sound of Perserverance... and I dont know how that ranks against the rest of them.  Im more of a Melodic Death person.
uyQppMYLaa	Personally I really like Emperor. I love their vocals (especially in contrast to Ihsahn's later vocal work in his solo project), I think the symphonic element is done well, and the riffs are ice-cold and precise. They are a little cheesy, and I think there are some much better black metal bands out there, but for their time they were, as you say, pioneers, and they had a great impact on the black metal scene. I deeply admire their work.<br>  <br>  BQ: It's a cliche, I know, but I still like In The Nightside Eclipse best<br>  BQ2: The Majesty of the Night Sky is my favourite original, but their versions of Gypsy and A Fine Day To Die are also excellent.|`|AA10092952	I'm a big fan of Emperor, and most black metal. <br>  So i have nothing but good thoughts for them.<br>  <br>  <br>  BQ:Favourite Album? In the Nightside Eclipse and Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk.<br>  <br>  - I am the Black Wizards<br>  - the Bathory cover of "A Fine Day To Die"<br>  - Ye Entrancemperium<br>  - An Elegy Of Icaros<br>  - With Strength I Burn<br>  - Curse you all men<br>  - The Acclamation Of Bonds<br>  - In Longing Spirit<br>  <br>  Those are just some of my favorites that come to mind.|`|xwD8PUFlaa	Not that into black metal, give me some songs & i'll give them a listen.|`|HlnAuiVYaa	they are my orgasm|`|ef4fdcd84e60e1dac24728288eab23faaa	I adore this band, they have been my favourite band for years, and if I asked this question i bet id be lucky to get one or 2 decent replies.<br>  My favourite album is definitely their first,1994's In The Nightside Eclipse,such an amazing album with that distinct Grieghallen sound, every album they ever released was brilliant, even their last one Prometheus was some album to go out with, left everyone wanting more.<br>  My favourite song is the opening for In The Nightside Eclipse, Into The Infinity Of Thoughts.I was and am still obsessed with that song.They have a live dvd coming out during the year too. I cant wait.|`|0kYCwThIaa	Ahhh hahahaha I love Emperor...<br>  <br>  As far as my favorite album goes, I have to go with In the Nightside Eclipse. It has great songs and the album cover is awesome. <br>  <br>  Favorite song.....uhhh Towards the Pantheon. Or The Eruption. Both of those are probably my favorite Emperor songs.|`|59826f918f5d8684a23c18a014a26563aa	well..im not a huge fan of this genre..i dont listen to bands that are purely black metal...emperor has a progressive and symphonic edge to their sound...i like their album 'Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk' <br>  <br>  fav song : The Loss and Curse of Reverence<br>  <br>  in the black metal category i like bands that influenced the black metal genre..eg..celtic frost, mercyful fate, king diamond, venom, etc|`|enIMNiCiaa	I had their split with Enslaved. That was pretty decent. Haven't really cared much for them until Prometheus-- Though it took 3 years to actually enjoy it.<br>  <br>  EDIT:Whoops didn't see the BQs<br>  <br>  BQ: I'd say the split with Enslaved. Emperor's Side was just called "Emperor"<br>  <br>  BQ2: Night of the graveless souls!|`|g8CqkU5haa	Err im a huge black metal fan,But not so into Emperor though just " i am the black wizards"...U need to check out Naglfar / Dissection / Old mans child/ Nargaroth / Graveworm|`|9ntoGPFyaa	it's as if Satan's communicating to us though their CD's, and of course that's a compliment. they're black metal, aren't they?<br>  <br>  BQ: IV Equilibrium<br>  BQ2: Empty|`|vlIXsFmhaa	I do not know this band....sorry. DIME bros unite any way though right?
KjYxk1S2aa	A lot of people hate anime because they don't believe it is 'art', and it tends to be rather pervasive--i.e. there is TONS of it, and people think most of it is low quality, or can't stand the anime 'culture'. A lot of people get too much into anime and make it their lives, which is a bad thing, but anime and manga, in and of themselves, can be absolutely great. The mass-produced animes with no real plot and cliche characters are stupid, yeah--but not just because they're anime. ANY show with no real plot and cliche characters is stupid; animated or live-action. :)<br>  <br>  For your friends to make fun of anime is like them making fun of movies in general--there's a huge spectrum of it. Some is fantasy, some is realistic, some is serious and some is funny. If they don't like it, tough--but it doesn't appear they know anything about it if they have such a negative general opinion. :) They probably haven't seen any decent anime, and thus think it's all just cookie-cutter stupidity.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, then tell them to bug off about it!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps,<br>  <br>  ~Jen|`|XNzj7b7Taa	no way<br>  i love anime and <br>  manga<br>  ur friends say that cuase they haven't read any of em yet|`|HhCctLofaa	Some people do hate but that's they're opinon. here's what i have to say ANIME AND MANGA ROCK! Then if they kept doing tell them You know What Please Drop It is Not What You Think It is So Bug Off|`|YCUJMvWQaa	im in your situation my friend i draw a lot of anime , but my friends say its a waste of time and junk BUT ITS NOT, because anime is awesome and we learn a lot from it,  dont let others change the way you are because of what they say be who you want to be =] love what you love|`|VvmzuWZmaa	No.Anime ang manga rocks.I know how you feel,my friends thinks it's stupid to.you have to find friends that likes you for  you who are!!|`|VmXq5NCOaa	No, anime and manga is not stupid.<br>  <br>  People hate it because they're ignorant and enjoy bashing on others for no good reason.|`|ul9qxw4Uaa	just show them a manga or anime and they'll know|`|IX4mSxEMaa	Most likely because 1.  They have preconceived notion of all anime/manga are like pokemon/digimon or whatever else they consider kiddy.  2.  They do not like to be part of the crowd since anime/manga is now slowly becoming more and more popular teen culture that they just make fun of it just so they can be different.  Kind of like now people makes fun of cheerleaders being all dumb.  3.  They might really actually like anime/manga but was afraid of the same thing as you did, so they make fun of it when they secretly adore them XD<br>  <br>  Whichever the case, what you like is your own business, and they have no right to make fun of you for anything.  If they would make fun of you for liking anime/manga to the point of you think it's a problem, then maybe they're not such a good friend to begin with.|`|KSC02NcLaa	No, Anime & Manga is AWESOME.   People hate it because they don't know anything about it.  Those Hateful People are sheep.  They don't understand what it is, so they fear it.  How to turn them around : Show them Elfen Lied, or Gantz.  Something Gory, not too intellectual (cause that comes later, after they're into it) to get them to understand you need wanton destruction & violence.  Not too much comedy, either.  Show them that one Ghost Hunt Episode about the Mansion & the almost dead guy that takes people to bathe in their blood.  Something that will scare the sh*t out of them, and make them into obedient little slaves to the Anime.|`|AA10978481	first off, tell them how you feel. if they can't respect that and still make fun of it, ditch them. to the question, no I do not think that either one are stupid. Both envelope such a wide range of genres that there is always something for anyone's taste. my mother, at first, also made fun of my husband and my love of them. However, when she started to actually sit down and watch some of them, she found some that even she liked. I think one of her favorites is "Howl's Moving Castle." If you want to introduce your friends to anime, look at the types of movies they enjoy and find anime that has similar characteristics.|`|AA10196284	I deal with the same crap myself.  It's like comparing the kids who like anime now with the kids who liked Dungeons and Dragons back then.  There's nothing wrong with anime/manga.  Some people can just be so naive.  It's probably because they don't understand the language and therefore are particular to it.  That and since they probably believe that US animation is superior (which can be argued) that anime is more childish and for geeks.  Some people take time while others need to be educated.  It's a fact of life so you keep on watching/reading.  It's not that you're wrong, it's the fact that they aren't right.|`|ot4lvMBbaa	No manga/anime is not stupid. It really depends on the one you watch/read. In my opinion many of them are great. Maybe ur friends just havent found the right one or maybe they are too arrogant (no offense) and just refuse to watch it. Some people hate it because of the style of drawing, My dad hates its because the hair is too pointy and such. I dont know what to tell u of ur friends, but maybe u can introduce one of ur favs to them...i wonder what kind of stuff they say about it...<br>  <br>  People hate it simply because they don't want to change how they see things or because they don't like new things. Also some people think the plot is stupid and such. Manga/anime is the same as another other book its just drawn out and in many of them you read right to left.  yup yup thats my answer to u.|`|ikNLUaZiaa	Some ppl hate it because they think it's childish cuz it's cartoons... But its not!! I love Manga and Anime!!!

OWXI806qaa	Watch 24 on Fox!<br>  I know that you got a lot of responses to this question,<br>  but this is the answer that you need to listen to.<br>  Trust me!<br>  24 is awesome!<br>  It has everything that you could ever want in a TV show.<br>  Drama, action, some romance, suspense & really good plot lines.<br>  But I will warn you, it's addictive. <br>  I love it 'cause there are so many<br>  twists & turns that you never saw coming. <br>  <br>  They began the seventh season in January,<br>  but you could probably find the first 6 seasons at <br>  Block Buster.<br>  I don't know if you know anything about it, but it's all <br>  in real time.<br>  Each season is one day. Each episode is one hour.<br>  There are 24 episodes in a season.<br>  It's basically about fighting terrorism & about a really awesome main <br>  character named Jack Bauer. He's like my favorite <br>  super hero ever.<br>  (even though he doesn't technically have super powers, but<br>  sometimes I wonder. lol)<br>  <br>  It's not the kind of show where you can just start watching <br>  at any point & still know what's going on.<br>  You have to start from the beginning, or at least the beginning<br>  of a season. <br>  And the first season is good, but don't judge the<br>  whole show just by the first season. <br>  Keep going after that. (If you start there)<br>  <br>  It comes on Monday nights on fox.<br>  CHOOSE 24! Seriously. <br>  I've seen a lot of TV shows, & it really is the best.<br>  After you've seen a few seasons, (if it takes that long)<br>  You won't ever like anything as much. <br>  Hope I could help.<br>  <br>  (check out the links below)|`|U00EHxoFaa	24.

9ccCHZHgaa	Just talk to him, in that honest, sincere way. And don't pressure him into taking decisions - just let him think about it and he'll eventually make up his mind and come back to you (or not, but if you really didn't do anything wrong, it's more likely that he'll come back). <br>  And you're saying he's not even really talking to you, and you want to get him to listen and respond. If you want him to listen, tell him to listen to you this time and if he's not satisfied with that you're telling him, well you'll leave him alone after. (if he likes you, cares about you, not only he'll listen but deeply think about it). As for getting him to respond, you shouldn't expect anything. If he doesn't want to respond now, nothing will bring him to do it. <br>  Keep in mind that if he's acting that way, it's not because he hates you - it's because he's really hurt, and if he can be hurt by something you said/did (or he thinks you said/did), he most likely really likes you.<br>  <br>  And I agree with Elde. Take him aside in person. And don't make a big scene out of it if it's possible,because he probably won't like it.|`|ax9xk0Ndaa	Are you sure there's nothing you did that you might be unaware had hurt him?<br>  <br>  And do you think maybe the taurus friend was stirring things?<br>  <br>  The best thing to do would be ring him and tell him how you feel or take him aside in person (which will be hard but you can do it if you try) and tell him how you feel..<br>  And how you don't want all the tension..<br>  <br>  Hope everything works out|`|QZzQdh43aa	How to influence him: He is methodical, routine and organized, show him how you schedule your own life's activities. He is conventional, practical and efficient, show him how well you manage your finances and resources. He is big on family and foundation, show him the family tree, bring along your kid brother, belong to an organization. He is a believer in "actions speak louder than words" regarding love. You may have to coax the love word from him. He likes the pursuit, so be a bit hard to get without over doing it. Some Caps, though very capable,  are lacking in self-confidence, be certain that you are a cheerleader.

874e9ed8d38f4753f6cca93e708cd95baa	If you were to base her solely on this week's judging, then I'd be more apt to agree with you, but when I saw her judging with the tryouts, I was a little more impressed with her.  She seemed to be more knowledgeable than Paula, on par with Randy (which is possibly why a lot of her comments on Tuesday night seemed to echo his comments).  For me, the jury is still out.  She was nervous last week too, I think.|`|Nkd13lyTaa	i agree with u i think she stuck up and doesn't know wat 2 say.. she doescoy randy alot as if she cant b bothered thinkin i dnt  like her  .. they just dont suit the things that you have 2 say in that competion|`|IE2YbJr0aa	I agree with you.

Ohba believed that the story would not hold much interest if L was significantly older than Light, so Ohba created L as a young adult. Ohba said that for L's name he wanted to use a single letter with a lot of significance; according to Ohba he considered "I" and "J" but decided that they did not "feel as good" as "L" and chose "L" "after careful consideration."[2]<br>  <br>  Ohba said that he gave L the alias "Ryuzaki" because L is pronounced like R in Japanese.[|`|J17S9q80aa	L is his first name his full name is L Lawliet|`|gwDftPBsaa	Dont think it means anything.

e1Vokw8Saa	I always have to recommend berserk. It's my personal favorite (although One Piece is a close second).  It's an amazing epic seinen manga. I have trouble finding anything bad to say about it.<br>  <br>  The manga itself is set in medieval Europe, and the art is just stunning; each panel is a masterpiece.<br>  <br>  The only caveat I have in recommending Berserk, is that it is extremely graphic in violence, gore, sex, and other very adult situations. I do not recommend this manga for anyone under the age of 18.<br>  <br>  Another seinen manga which is underrated and very good is Hellsing. This manga is also quite violent, but not to the point of gore. It's about the vampire Alucard and the English Protestants fighting off Nazi vampire and werewolf remnants as well as the forces of the Vatican. The series is finished as of a few months ago so you won't have to wait.<br>  <br>  If you need help locating either of these manga I can try to help you.<br>  <br>  I hope I was of some aid to you.

JPnL8s12aa	Seal’s appearance is the classic example of a relatively rare condition, discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE). Seal has revealed in interviews that he was afflicted with this syndrome as a teen. A condition where the immune cells attack various body tissues, DLE usually affects young people. Intense inflammation develops in the skin, particularly in sun-exposed areas. If not treated aggressively with sun protection and anti-inflammatory medicines, scarring can result. Not only did it cause the cheek scars, but he had significant scalp involvement, causing hair loss. The singer's condition has been in remission for years|`|fpuHVNYgaa	It comes from an African Tribe that purposely disfigures their faces.|`|6359LQLNaa	i can't remember why. i think it was a birth defect?

E2VUH8Q0aa	Yes. except the "want to be accepted" thing, which goes away when you get a little older. <br>  But the rest, yes, very much so. <br>  My Gemini co workers are an annoyance to me in most cases...they are very intelligent, but scattered, and can't stay focused for two seconds or their heads will explode.<br>  Which might be interesting to watch.<br>  And OH do they talk...talk....talk....and never say a thing..<br>  <br>  But as far as what you're describing about being alone and worrying about what others are thinking...that's very Capricorn-like. But when you get a bit more up in your career, and you've established yourself strongly, you will not worry about being accepted, and then it will all fall in line...you will naturally be accepted when you quit worrying about it.|`|G6Uy43coaa	You can't just judge someone by their signs.  Life's experiences play a major role in who someone is.  Chances are this Gemini is an Alpha female too.  <br>  <br>  I am intelligent and focused at times.  When I am not focused, its because i am spreading myself too thin.  I talk and write and am very creative.  Problem solving is easy as Gemini's are "idea" people.  <br>  <br>  if you are tempted to go head to head with this Gemini out of some personal agenda, I suggest you don't.  If she holds true to her sign and depending on her life's experiences, she will probably tell you off so nicely that you will wonder if she gave you a compliment or just kicked your *** in front of everyone at the office.
uwg62QBAaa	i agree with you. i dont have anything to forgive her for i mean she never did anything to me. i mean like seriously thousands upon thousands of teen take slutty pics everyday and miley cyrus gets bad-mouthed about it by everyone in the country. shes kinda dumb though for letting them get around every time she takes one. but yeah. shes still not a good actress or singer but cut her some slack. shes just a teen.<br>  also i don't see how u could hate someone u don't even know. stop judging someone u dont know.<br>  <br>  EDIT - yeah and vanessa hudgens took NUDE pics yet shes not bad-mouthed/hated on as miley. and shes not one bit more talented (ok maybe a little but not much)|`|oDx3Jgdcaa	i shouldnt forgive her cause shes done nothing to me. but i like how ur not overreacting like others....good for u<br>  i mean vanesse hudgens took NUDE pics and she, being from disney, is not being hated on like miley is...i dont get that|`|v1tHjJ3haa	I'm just for hannah montana and her music I don't want to get into her scandal stuff|`|bmwR7RdMaa	A BIG ZERO !|`|1a6a3af6da727166c63a917a0c6ce580aa	nope. she STILL takes bad pictures of herself, she STILL dresses to impress guys older than HER, she STILL can't sing, and she is STILL very immature.|`|mwm8iSBsaa	I am starting to forgive her!<br>  i was a big fan then i stopped liking her!<br>  no, i think she is a good girl and truly honest!<br>  bu not much of a big fan!|`|QSUg9vNLaa	Maybe, shes offended alot of people, and embarassed nick jonas, so idk.|`|JPnL8s12aa	ppl who look up to her should be punched in the face.|`|LK26v0z3aa	Not everyone, but some.

jVLcrUfXaa	It is due to the feb 17 Digital TV transition where many stations are switching over to a digital signal. While a recent bill was signed to postpone the transition until june, many stations took the opportunity to change now as the delay would have meant extra costs. The scheduling of the original transition date caused the TV networks to delay the traditional february sweeps until march (agreed upon months ago) which is why so many shows are into reruns during february and into the early part of march this season. The march 5th return date for smallville infamous episode was changed to march 12th (along with Supernatural) in order to avoid positioning a new episode against a ratings juggernaut semi final epsiode of American Idol.|`|EufwiT3qaa	they haven't been showing any new episodes on the cw for the past few weeks. no new gossip girl, one tree hill, 90210, or SMALLVILLE!!

With a lot of musical intellectualism. Killer drum work, awesome violin work. Great album.<br>  <br>  No Exit is my 2nd favorite but the production is awful very poorly produced but killer heavy riffs on that album<br>  <br>  start with those 2 and if you like them I well recommend more|`|2bVxBCgzaa	Hi- I've ben a fan for about 20 years, and I think their last album, FWX, is possibly their best. It's just incredible writing- one of my favorite albums by anyone. I also liked No Exit, Parallels, and Inside Out.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	I've only heard two, but I like them both.<br>  <br>  "No Exit" to me sounds a little dated, I think because of the '80s-style production. Not a bad album, though.<br>  <br>  But I really like "A Pleasant Shade of Grey." Totally epic. Lots of great shifting moods and heavy riffs and dramatic, sweeping atmosphere. Highly recommended.|`|enIMNiCiaa	Metallum users gave Awaken The Guardian 90%, not the highest rating, but with the most reviews, that'd make it their best album.|`|IBvz3tckaa	Awaken The Guardian was their best(and last) with original singer John Arch. No Exit was their heaviest and most straight forward with Ray Alder singing and my personal fave with him.

AA10638471	No. Jericho got canceled. The ratings were not high enough so the station had to axe it. Some say it is because of the time slot but I don't think anyone knows for sure. There were many other shows such as Boston Legal and Law and Order that were on during the airing of Jericho. That brings up the idea of Nielsen Ratings and DVR and web viewing. Nielsen ratings do include online web watching. The episode's 7.1 million viewers was much better than the tail end of season one, but nowhere near as good as the show's first few episodes. Character development vanished, the pacing was off, and there seemed to be no passion or caring in the Kansas town.If the show's second season had been a full 22 episodes, we would have gotten to see the seat of government in Cheyenne — and life in New York, which survived the attacks thanks to Hawkins' intervention. Now we'll just have to be happy with one truncated second season, and nothing after that.|`|RVe1sN09aa	Nah it got cancelled.

nNAAClOqaa	Make sure that you breathe from your diaphragm. That is probably the most helpful thing. If you want to stretch your range, just do songs that are higher and focus on being off key and you will get the key right. The trick is to not think about it. Don't focus on getting it right so much as the performance part of it. After you get the song down then you can move on to blocking it and all of the fun stuff. As for the acting, I can't help you there. I'm not an actor, just an aspiring singer :)|`|wJVnhPpmaa	Basically.. just practice, get a teacher. Try doing scales and see how high you can get, then just keep going to that point, then see if you can go higher the next few times.. thats what id do

I actually have a couple of Godspeed You Black Emperor albums. But I find that a lot of it sounds too much alike.

Two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He doesn't seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed. The other guy takes out his phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps: "My friend is dead! What can I do?" The operator says: "Calm down, I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead." There is a silence, then a gunshot is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says: "OK, now what?" <br>  <br>  <br>  2. A guy is sitting at home when he hears a knock at the door. He opens the door and sees a snail on the porch.

The snail says "What the hell was that all about?"<br>  <br>  <br>  3.Two campers are hiking in the woods when one is bitten on the rear end by a rattlesnake. "I’ll go into town for a doctor," the other says. He runs ten miles to a small town and finds the town’s only doctor, who is delivering a baby. "I can’t leave," the doctor says. ‘But here’s what to do. Take a knife, cut a little X where the bite is, suck out the poison and spit it on the ground." The guy ruins back to his friend, who is in agony. ‘What did the doctor say?" the victim asks. "He says you’re gonna die."<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.

Colbie Caillat) by Jason mraz lyrics, but i don't think that will help you, since you have quite a lot. But, if you want to know who sings who, I've done some research and can't find any. So, i believe that if you go on you tube you can pause the song as it goes by.

yc4y7yKkaa	That's how movie theaters make their money. Movie theaters really don't take in that much revenue (esp. not from the box office), so concessions keep them afloat. This is also why some are opening restaurants within the theater and arcades as well. Do you think it's a coincidence that the popcorn is so salty? It's not. Salt makes you thirsty; want a $3 coke with that popcorn ma'am?<br>  <br>  From CNN-Money:<br>  "Owners joke about being in the candy business," said theater owner Howard Edelman, proprietor of Movieland Cinemas, an independent string of cinemas in the Long Island, NY-area. "If you didn't have concessions at a movie theater, there would be no movie theater. We have movies just to get people in to buy popcorn and candy, where we make our money."|`|BgZA7lvQaa	Because of the recession.  Pretty soon they will be getting bailed out too.
VILBKcZMaa	Yeah cartoon network starting to suck because now they have shows like Chowder, Flapjack, Secret Saturdays, and even that gay azz Batman show. I like Dragonball Z alot for the fighting and when they fight it seemed mature for my age. But are you serious about them canceling Naruto. Man they're getting weirder by the minute. Plus they should edit 6teen like they did with Total Drama Island to make it younger for kids to watch Cartoon Network.|`|4qVWj3UHaa	i totally agree, i liked the classics like dexters labratory, and jonny bravo. i mean what the **** is chowder about. its pointless. it has no central theme, and it pisses me off.|`|Dnf4ijdJaa	yeaa it does suck now, i miss powerpuff girls, dexters lab., and alllllll those other great show but chowder and flapjack are actually pretty funny i think, better then the rest of the shows. adult swim is pretty good :]|`|1ko8AnvTaa	I think its just sucks because they took out a lot of worthy animation for which many people used to like CN and instead they chose to keep these cartoons that keep getting weirder and more disturbing by the minute.<br>  Maybe they changed their target audience but if this is the cartoons kids nowadays see Im frankly scared of what they are watching...|`|AA10065759	I miss shows like....<br>  <br>  Teen Titans<br>  <br>  Puffy AmiYumi (the CN did an elaborate float for the Macy's<br>  Thanksgiving Parade in 2005 and 7 months later they<br>  canceled the series and TT).<br>  <br>  and Justice League...<br>  <br>  In fact, at the time "Teen Titans" and "Puffy AmiYumi" was their<br>  two highest rated shows.<br>  <br>  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -|`|HhpRxYSLaa	Oh I know I miss the old CN, with the Cartoon Cartoon Fridays, Toonami, etc.<br>  <br>  All the good shows are gone. I hate the fact that Toonami ended the most. AND they're taking anime off of adult swim in May:(. I hate the new CN.<br>  <br>  The only shows I really like on CN now are Ben 10 Alien Force, 6Teen, and Total Drama Island. When Naruto Shippuden finally starts airing on CN (if it does) I'm adding that to the list, too.<br>  <br>  EDIT: No, Naruto hasn't been cancelled off CN yet, they're just taking a break since Toonami ended. Then they're going to air the last remaining filler episodes of part 1 Naruto and then start airing Shippuden in Spring.|`|pTERJdzQaa	I have to agree to disagree with you on this, Cartoon Network does not suck, they have awesome shows like Star Wars The Clone Wars, 6Teen, Total Drama Island, Chowder etc. And have you heard their new theme song: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3LHCMpSGX8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3LHCMpSG...</a><br>  They were awesome in the past to, but their improving with the new shows they are getting. It pissed me off greatly when Toonami was cancelled that hurt them greatly, I will be pissed if they cancel Naruto and the lack of Anime sucks A**.|`|874e9ed8d38f4753f6cca93e708cd95baa	If you think the day is sucking, what about Adult Swim?  They keep messing around with the schedule, they have cut the anime down to one night a week, and any of the original shows they have on, you need to be somewhat wasted to really appreciate lately.  And I agree with you about the flapjack and chowder shows, from what little I've seen, they are totally retarded!|`|51ee80979fe7a807b77f69b28d0cc193aa	1. Not a lot of the good anime anymore. (like Inuyasha, Gundam Wing, Cowboy Bebop, and Dragonball Z)<br>  <br>  2. Dumb shows like 6teen and Total Drama Island.<br>  <br>  3. Putting on regular movies on that are not cartoons.<br>  <br>  4. Not taking off some of the stupid adult swim shows. (like Tim & Eric, Superjail, Home Movies)<br>  <br>  To make it better.....<br>  <br>  1. Make Robot Chicken a half hour long.<br>  <br>  2. Bring back some core classic cartoons like Bugs Bunny, Tom & Jerry, Animaniacs, Tiny Toon, etc. <br>  <br>  3. Bring back the real Toonami.|`|SbQigWzUaa	Cartoon Network seems to refuse to show Naruto episodes. The newer series should have aired on Cartoon Network by now, but due to the fact that they would stop airing the current show for weeks, it's not going to happen anytime soon. I miss some of the better shows, like Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi.|`|bshHtxfFaa	Its just usually cartoon channels aim for the "younger" kids and not like teenagers anymore. I still remember when sailor moon first appeared on cartoonnetwork. I was like 7 i think and I used to love it soo much! I wish that they still have it now, but i guess its old and they have newer shows. And your right, some of their shows suck... I wish toonami would come back. even their adult swim now suck! haha|`|79WjfzPLaa	Yep, it sucks. Why did they have to get rid of Toonami? And they also edit A LOT of funny parts out of Naruto already, along with some blood and violence. Not even my 5 year old sibling likes it anymore....|`|rc7GbYx9aa	all of the classic shows are off and now these gay shows are on not to be mean but i loved CN b4 now im like screw it it b*** s***<br>  <br>  <br>   I MISS THE LOONEY TOONS THEY WERE AWESOME WHY DID THEY TAKE IT OFF THOSE WERE THE CLASSIC YOU CANT FIND THEM ANYWHERE NOW !!! >:o|`|pPI04R8saa	i have to agree with u about every thing except #1.)

ryLbKatoaa	Well, according to (what I remember from) D&D, a half Demon is a Cambion, a half Devil is a Tiefling, and a half god (or angel...?) is an Aasimar. But that's when mixed with a human (or humanoid race? Idk... So one could work...).<br>  <br>  Though you could also use terms like "dark angel", "fallen", "corrupt", or anything else that suggests that she's not pure angel.|`|UepGEiR9aa	she's undefined until she picks a side.|`|tVvH28GCaa	There isn't an actual term. So you can either make one up or use phrases like "half breed" "half-demon", etc.|`|tjIhdizbaa	Degel o-O?<br>  Hybrid o-O?|`|eR8uVnQcaa	how about angvil or devgel?  Diabelus?<br>  In western cultures a demon is the same as a devil and thus evil.  The word daemon might be more neutral and could include angels and devils.  Or call angels and devils spirits.<br>  In the Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion the spiritual beings are call ainur (not to be confused with the ainu of Japan).    The ones who came into the world to do good are called the Valar, the great lords, and their followers the maiar.  Many other spirits came into the world, some to do the evil.  The evil ones include Morgoth, the most powerful of all spirits, Sauron, a maia corrupted by Morgoth,  and the balrogs, among others.<br>  Angels and devils are supposed to be pure spirits, though they can make bodies for themselves out of matter.  Angels and devils probably aren't supposed to reproduce, though you shouldn't let it stop you from writing a good story.  You should let it stop you from writing a bad story, but not a good one.  You might want to do some research in angelology and demonology in Christian, Jewish, and Muslim religion.<br>  For example, just as God was Emperor of heaven and the Roman/Byzantine/Holy Roman Emperor was considered the rightful ruler of all the Earth, the Devil was considered to be an emperor and had kings and presidents among his subordinate devils.  A number of famous devils were supuppose to have theri ow n unigue and bizzare body forms.  The Christian angels were suupposed to have a heirarchy of nine ranks.   And so on.

They'll help with expanding your vocal range and help getting your voice more powerful. I have a beautfiul voice and I'm very talented but I just started taking voice lessons and they had helped me get my voice more powerful and I have potential of becoming a vocalist soon and I'm really excited for. Some voice lessons will help you get where you want to go. If you want to get discovered they will help you get there. Basically its all about naural talent and you already have it. Voice lessons will help you even more. They'll help you get more powerful and you can sing all the 8 octaves if you wanted to sing all of them, Good Luck|`|TJBEeXO2aa	You sound too breathy, you're taking a lot of breaths, the voice is kind of nasally. <br>  <br>  I'm not being mean here.

Go for it, you'll learn everything you ever needed to know about singing, and you'll learn how to find out if a song is good for your voice or not.  They would never laugh at you, they would praise you for taking them.  The point of lessons isn't to be good when you get there, it's to take your voice from where you're at to another level.<br>  <br>  Good luck (:|`|H2mKGkvTaa	They would not laugh at you cause you are a great singer and if you want ot be better then i would take singing lessons... you should sing slower songs cause Umbrella is a pretty fast song and you  sang slower but otherwise that was really good. :-)

Little do they know, there is a secret door in one room that would need a button-shaped key to open. When Coraline is finally able to go through, she discovers a parrallel universe with the exact same house and people (like her parents). BUT, everyone has buttons for eyes....she enjoys the world behind the door much better than the one she already lived in. But as the movie goes by, she discovers that her parents on the other side are evil, and the parrallel-mom wants to sew buttons into Coraline's eyes...and trap her there forever!<br>  <br>  Ok I'm sorry if I gave too much away.|`|3Z4YFz29aa	have you read the book?

5S1Jhabsaa	I think that Chris Brown is a stupid asshole for freaking beating up Rihanna.Also for turning himself in. I mean you had your chance to do the right thing,buddy. I mean if i beat up my girlfriend badly then I wouldnt just casually drive down to the police station and say hey i beat up my girlfriend. arrest me so i can post 50000 on my bail. i mean whats the point if your gonna bail yourself out anyway?|`|HQjo5ojfaa	Is anyone looking at this face as swollen from crying.. is anyone wonder what she was hit with... Does anyone else see the two slightly curved marks/bruises on the side of her head over her eyes. These are some kind of impression and not made with a hand or fist... Something strange is going on. As light as she is she should be purple and blue all over.... This is not a horrific beating...The pictures on TMZ, thats what I think of it. Why isn't it in the news when a middle class person gets abused if this is true?? Why does Rhianna get more sympathy than other women out there in abusive relationships?? I don't like how big the media has blown this up, and for all we know, Rhianna could be playing some kind of Grief Story. Not saying what Chris supposedly did was in anyway excusable, but we may not be getting both sides of the story.|`|YP0eCyJBaa	It is hard to press charges on someone that you know and love, you can't say what you would do because your not in that situation.|`|MMmv06Ynaa	It must have been Rihanna's fault somehow. It is really bad that Chris Brown did what he did, but we don't know the true story yet.|`|krRCVZL4aa	Well, Rihanna or Robyn Fenty, obviously is beyond PO'd and Chris brown right now, I mean he olmost killed her, and he wanted to too, s I'm pretty sure they will stay apart and who knows rihanna may get a restraining order, but then again it's young love, right, anything could happen|`|6359LQLNaa	it sounds fishy to me. i don't think that he did it. because i think that she would press charges.<br>  plus she  doesn't talk about it.<br>  maybe they had kinky sex and he bruised her up?<br>  have you read breaking dawn by any chance? :)|`|aSdUzlIiaa	Have you seen her!!!!<br>  if not look here:<a href="http://www.tmz.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tmz.com/</a><br>  I think it will come back to chis Jay Z said if he catches him He will make sure it does.<br>  <br>  (u have to scroll down to see her all bruised)|`|J2G6ebThaa	i think its terrible too i don't like him anymore but he still has good music|`|yz0cx103aa	i think he can't go to jail for domestic abuse.

(like before or so I've heard) I just don't think he deserves any of them. He's a good singer and all but why does he have to keep breaking up with every girl he dates?

dBj2zVOdaa	I think they're still alive, but here's a snip from the Wiki page about Booth; plus a link below which may explain your mom's confusion.<br>  <br>  In season 4 episode Hero in the Hold, it is revealed that he named his son Parker, after his slain spotter, Edward "Teddy" Parker. Booth blamed himself for Teddy's death until he came face to face with Teddy's ghost who revealed that his death was not Booth's fault but his own as he disobeyed his superior's orders to "get down" repeatedly. In the end of the episode, Teddy reveals himself to Bones on the anniversary of his death; She doesn't know who he is and thinks he is just another man visiting fallen comrades in the cemetery.|`|fFtS4Kveaa	well you were kind of right, i said kind of right because you weren't sure if he did. and no he didn't the last two episodes when booth was man-napped by the grave digger he mention to his army buddy ghost he has a son named Parker. Which turn out that the ghost of his army buddy his name was Parker.
MectMKuWaa	Ted Nasser and erica went to a new swamp!<br>  <br>  There they had to find a a 1 kill deathbox there was three one for each of them!<br>  <br>  Ted didnt find it so he was hiding nassre and erica were fighting then ted saw nasser kill ericka at the last secound then Ted and Nasser had to look for a key to unlock the house with all the money, Nasser couldnt find it LOL! so ted got it and made it and the mastermind goes "Ted, You have won... but there can only be 1 winner" And a guy with a chainsaw jumped out infront of nasser and mnasser went "Oh." and then blood splattered on the tree next to him!<br>  <br>  Ted got the money and saw the mastermind with a doll mask that's white like micheal meyers, so he crossed to take it off but hit a trip wire! which caused a bomb to countdown from 60 secounds on the island. Ted took off the mask and it said "you may have won.. but ted you are dead." ted looks and has 25 secounds to leave he got out 5 secounds in time and the island exploded by him! <br>  <br>  It's sad though because their is not going to be a 2nd season im thinking so...<br>  <br>  I guess that was it. I use to LOVE! watching the show....<br>  <br>  =(<br>  <br>  But yeah.. now it's over Im watching harpers island april 9th though<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  yeah if you know of any shows like 13 please tell me them i need somthing to watch before april.|`|lCE5sziNaa	Ted won. The contestants were sent on a boat to a swamp and had to make sacrifice voodoo dolls. Ted made one of Erica, Erica made one of Nasser, and Nasser made one of Ted. At the first execution ceremony, the contestants had to search for one of three death boxes in the woods which was locked up in a cage, and use it to kill of another player. Nasser managed to find one first, and after a while of scrambling, he got to Erica and killed her. In the second execution ceremony which followed immediately after, Nasser and Ted had to search for pet cemeteries in which a wrench-like tool was buried with worms and bugs. One acquired, the contestant had to use the tool to open a hidden tin barrel in the woods. Ted was the first to get to his barrel. The barrel was filled with animal insides and snakes. Ted managed to find the key inside the barrel and therefore had won 13: Fear Is Real. Nasser was then killed by a chainsaw and the mastermind told Ted to make his way to the locked cabin in which the mastermind was ready to meet Ted and give him the money prize. Ted walked in on a fake dummy with a bag of money, and a timer. Ted quickly got the money and paddled away as the winner of 13: Fear Is Real.<br>  <br>  Hopefully we can get a second season!|`|c544153bf8f85408fe4965bb69419305aa	I watched it but  I don't know all their names, the white dude Ted won and it was really good.  The one dude got the death box and killed the girl then the 2 guys had to find a pet cemetery grave site to find bolt cutters.  Then they had to find a drum, cut the lock with the bolt cutters to find the key inside and go to the masterminds house and get the money but get out in time before the house blew up.  Very good show I would watch the listings on Sunday night to see if they show a replay of the episode.  I'm sure that's when they'll show it again.|`|b9a6a5aee52af5368dd2048bb9d923c7aa	You watch that??<br>  and didnt they just like start the show and they already have a season finally??..WOW|`|IFnyC2naaa	Ted.

ttyuhvGPaa	Well the only one who has even came close to beating batman (comicwise) was bane, when he broke his back leaving Wayne paraplegic for a long while. However Batman was exhausted after catching many of his major nemises among the likes of the Joker, the Scarecrow, the Mad Hatter, The Ventriloquist, Firefly, Cavalier, and Zsasz. <br>  <br>  Regardless yeah Batman has never really had a massive beatdown to Death (a la Superman v. Doomsday fashion). So yeah Batman is pretty much the bad@$$ hero.|`|1ko8AnvTaa	Batman is so awesome I think he is by far the bet superhero ever jaja. <br>  I think the only one that can defeat Batman is Death.
JeR9DyJyaa	I think you're only allowed to watch.|`|dejqLjaLaa	I agree with the second person.<br>  They said it's an 'exclusive' live chat and only the people who are throwing a House Party can join. But they are hosting it at Justin.tv/JonasBrothers which is a public site. So for the people who aren't hosting a house party will probably just watch if they can.|`|GilxwZ2Haa	Um... I don't know what happens when you sign up for a house party.<br>  <br>  But they said the live chat is only for people throwing house parties.

2tn8EALqaa	It really depends on the sponsor and their fame.<br>  But they get paid MILLIONS. <br>  Example, not so famous Vanessa Anne Hudgens got 20 million for Ecko Red. <br>  <br>  <br>  As for the Britney, that is not an ad. That is a photo they published without her consent.<br>  On the other hand, celebs do get paid to reveal pics or for interviews. Jamie Lynn got million for her baby pictures. Brad and Angelina got over 10<br>  <br>  Yeah, famous people have way too much money. But it's our fault really...<br>  <br>  to the person below:<br>  V. Hudgens was TOTALLY nude. Career not over...|`|vV1hPhfWaa	If britney was totally nude in an ad her career would be over.  I think it's safe to say they get paid more money for revealing more though.  Anyway, it's gotta be a hefty sum if they are willing to sell their soul to do it.

If you try buying them from eBay, or Craiglist, or anywhere else, they might charge you $5 more plus shipping. Don't worry if it costs too much, you'll have loads of fun! Just try your best to save up your money. For backstage passes, most likely you won't find them on the internet, so you can't buy them, and if you could, trust me it would be ALOT. Just get to the show early and hopefully the person who is in charge of the meet and greet passes will give you and your friend one! Trust me, meet and greets are probably as fun as back stage passes.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|oDx3Jgdcaa	theres a contsest to go to atlantis, its on their myspace page. theres not really any on sale now....but u can get tickets  to the 3d concert experience!! <br>  cant wait comes out next friday|`|bmwR7RdMaa	ebay|`|uN3XUSzeaa	ebay but right now fraud is big on ebay|`|HQjo5ojfaa	Really cheap JB tickets???<br>  <br>  Hmm....<br>  <br>  Non-existent. <br>  <br>  Haha.

Many people are trying to justify him by saying that she gave him herpes but there is no reason to justify a man who beats women. He bit her, beat her, and strangled her unconscious. If you look for her picture in TMZ you will see how horrible this is. She has bit marks, and huge bumps on her forehead that look like devil horns(I wonder what he hit her with). A good resource says that they got into an argument in the car and she took the car keys and threw them out the window, Chris brown got so mad that he strangled her and started beating her. He really deserves to go to jail.<br>  BTW Rhianna wasn't beat she was brutally attacked by a savage|`|HQjo5ojfaa	Is anyone looking at this face as swollen from crying.. is anyone wonder what she was hit with... Does anyone else see the two slightly curved marks/bruises on the side of her head over her eyes. These are some kind of impression and not made with a hand or fist... Something strange is going on. As light as she is she should be purple and blue all over.... This is not a horrific beating...The pictures on TMZ, thats what I think of it. Why isn't it in the news when a middle class person gets abused if this is true?? Why does Rhianna get more sympathy than other women out there in abusive relationships?? I don't like how big the media has blown this up, and for all we know, Rhianna could be playing some kind of Grief Story. Not saying what Chris supposedly did was in anyway excusable, but we may not be getting both sides of the story.|`|YF3uPqPfaa	i think it would be weird if they stayed together.  imagine that.  that's the way of the world some places so imagine stars started doing that.  i mean we've probably seen it before but i wonder how well received it would be these days from the biggest part of the population|`|KYFLS2Qyaa	If you visit TMZ.com you'll see, that he did indeed hit her.

AA10196284	Alright!  Someone with my taste!  It's apparent you like harem/comedy.  So here's a list of my faves:<br>  <br>  Tenchi Muyo<br>  Magikano<br>  Sorcerer Hunters<br>  Bubblegum Crisis<br>  Mouse<br>  Ai Yori Aoshi<br>  Full Metal Panic|`|hVqRcej7aa	My-HIME<br>  <a href="http://www.jetwavetv.co.cc/JetWaveTV/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jetwavetv.co.cc/JetWaveTV/</a><br>  <br>  My-HIME starts out with the main character, Mai Tokiha, and her younger brother heading to Fuuka Academy after receiving a scholarship to attend school there. On the way there Mai becomes mixed up in a fight between two HIMEs, which are girls that can materialize weapons and creatures to fight. In the melee the ferry is literally split in half. As the fight continues Mai accidental get in between the fight and discovers that she also has powers and is HIME too.<br>  <br>  The show has some of the best character development I've seen in a series; especially in a series with such a larger cast. The characters are quiet realistic as far as their reactions to the events around them. This is one of the things that really pulled me into the series. There's plenty of fan service, great fight scenes, decent comedy, romance and drama drama drama (those who've seen this know what I mean). What more can you ask for.<br>  <br>  <br>  Shakugan no Shana (action/romance/supernatural)<br>  <a href="http://www.justdubs.net/dubs/shakugan_no_shana.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.justdubs.net/dubs/shakugan_no...</a><br>  <br>  It was a normal day of the life of Sakai Yuuji. When all of the sudden, his life changes when a Monster called "Tomogara" attacks him and everyone around him. He was confused and shocked because everyone around him was turned into a blue flame and being consumed by the monster. Yuuji's life was then saved by a girl in a black coat, with Burning Eyes (also known as Shakugan) and flaming red hair holding a long sword. Due to the confusion and chaotic mess Yuuji gotten into, he follows the girl with the flaming red hair and finds out the truth about everything around him. Yuuji find out that the truth is that the people around him have blue flame in their chests are not real people and that he was not a real person. He is a torch and torches are temporary replacements for people that have died and had their existence consumed by the monsters.|`|rNxK7cY8aa	I suggest Full Metal Panic! as well.

uMMP6J6laa	Do you know MONK is the 42 in Most Popular Drama on tv.com.<br>  <br>  <br>  Former police detective Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub), whose photographic memory and amazing ability to piece together tiny clues made him a local legend, has suffered from intensified obsessive-compulsive disorder and a variety of phobias since the unsolved murder of his wife, Trudy, in 1997. Now on psychiatric leave from the San Francisco Police Department and working as a...|`|64491cf5ed73ad038115b2f4040d2213aa	This week's episode didn't have any obvious clues to Trudy's murder.  He was protesting the demolition of the parking garage in which she died.  They do show the location where she died - section B5 and Monk couldn't let it go because it was the last thing she saw before she died. <br>  <br>  In the upcoming final season, I'm hoping they tie up all the loose ends so we're not forever wondering if he ever solves her murder.  We know Monk would never stop searching and even though he's made some progress, he'll never be the same without Trudy.<br>  <br>  Here's what I'd like to see:   Monk finally puts all the pieces together and finds out who really murdered Trudy (maybe Dale the Whale gets into an Overeaters 12 step program and finally confesses the truth?!)<br>  <br>  Once the truth is out, we find out that Trudy was not really killed - she was put into the witness protection program to draw out the real killer.  She thought it would only be temporary, that is why her "last words" were Bread and Butter.  She was trying to tell Adrian that she would return to him.  (Adrian said that she always used to say that when they were walking and holding hands and something got in their way like a telephone pole.  They'd momentarily let go but then be back together shortly)  She and Monk are reunited and Monk's phobias start to taper off.  Sharona and Benji return to San Francisco to meet Trudy too.  (If only we could find a way to bring Dr Kroger back too!)
tQXle8pKaa	Maybe a mall hunt. Go and talk to different stores about giving girls clues to get from one store to the next. Or you could have a hunt in your neighbor hood. Set up clues on posts and stuff like that. Or you could do what I'm doing for my 12th bday, a murder mystery party. Or if you son't want a murder party, when it's time t open gifts, have maybe 2 or 3 of them be "stole" and in place of them would be clues that lead you to clues and then lead you to the gifts!

It just means even more publicity.<br>  However neither of them are very "famous" outside of their target audience of preteens in America.|`|dejqLjaLaa	As of right now, with all the picture scandals of Miley, the Jonas Brothers are more famous then her.|`|dFmmFub5aa	I think Miley is. People talk about her more. And shes in the news more, and its usually about bad stuff about her.|`|DUqzR7FWaa	jonas brothers|`|GDdTEEDZaa	miley|`|diAqosiIaa	sorry but who cares?|`|2BNbtq0waa	They're probably equally famous, in different ways. Miley's always in the news for 'bad' stuff, which I think is blown wayyy out of proportion, and they're seriously must be Hannah Montana everything, everywhere (Lip gloss, singing cards, beach towels, etc). The Jonas brothers mostly for good stuff, although they do get some not-so great press such as the Niley & Nelena relationships/breakups and the Taylor Swift/Joe bullsh*t, but who doesn't? I personally love them both.|`|SJQCBCJCaa	I love both, but i  would have to say the jonas brothers because most girls are obsessed with them.  I don't think any boys are obsessed with miley.|`|3Z1xwi4Qaa	ID SAY THERE EQUALL <br>  <br>  MINE?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219162414AAnA6Ww">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|JI6qVbBDaa	miley is more known then jonas brothers even my mum know who she is|`|liKNyTg8aa	Miley Cyrus. She has her own TV show. But they are both equally awesome! Oh and the Jonas Brothers have their own TV Show too but that's not for a while.|`|7PX6RSLXaa	Jonas Brothers!!!!!! <br>  Miley can't sing for her life!! She has NO talent!! She can't act!! And when they change her voice to make an album she sounds like a drunk!!|`|hypmxRlJaa	Hmm... probably Miley.|`|oHTaI6K0aa	Both quite over rated|`|CHPuw61Uaa	Miley Cyrus|`|cVtHEVRnaa	THE JONAS BROTHERS.<br>  Miley's more well-known.  But not everybody likes her.|`|vFlUT9Zzaa	Me.<br>  <br>  What? You haven't heard???<br>  <br>  <br>  ;-)<br>  <br>  Haha... don't worry, I'm just kidding :D|`|y4UXTD5kaa	I would say The Jonas Brothers.....Miley Cyrus is so out of the picture right now....NO OFFENSE!!!!|`|OacvhbNraa	JONAS BROTHERS :)|`|7nRJb2qCaa	I think that now the Jonas Brothers have more fame than Miley.|`|ZO8tWC6aaa	deff miley
UAHjJpC0aa	it you are looking for free an legal ways to remix "OTHER' PEOPLES SONGS"<br>  there aren't any...<br>  someone owns the copyrights to those songs<br>  you can NOT remix them or alter them in any way,<br>  legally...<br>  <br>  garage band is probably the best way to remix your own songs, <br>  without buying a GOOD program<br>  <br>  good luck !
uwg62QBAaa	yes! i know thousands of women get beat much much worse evryday and i dont see them on the news.|`|2tn8EALqaa	agreed.<br>  Forget the second answer! When did you even bad mouth Rihanna? All  you said was that people are acting as if she was an angel and I couldn't have said it better myself!<br>  Ugh, people either want to IDOLIZE a celeb or HATE them and laugh at their downfall. They get the best of both worlds here.<br>  Rihanna: she's soooo pretty. Oh, and she seemed really nice reading all her scripts and teleprompters!<br>  <br>  Chris Brown: whatta punk. His career is ooover hahaha|`|ubk21UBvaa	yes it does happen<br>  <br>  but rihanna can bring awareness to this terrible abuse, and make a difference.<br>  <br>  and you sound really ignorant. do you wnat people to treat rihanna like a devil becasue someone attemped to kill her and she doesnt have cancer?<br>  <br>  seriously, thats low|`|BWVDKixeaa	Fact is the press makes a big deal out of everything celebrities do and say. No it's not cancer but it is abuse and sometimes in real life women end up dead at the hands of their abusers.  It doesn't need to be compared.  It's an issue and I for one think it's a very serious issue.<br>  <br>  I don't know her and no one besides those cloest to her know her. If she was no angel then he should have left her, not beat the **** out of her.|`|hypmxRlJaa	It's a big deal because they're celebrities... young celebrities who both have careers and now Chris Brown's career is potentially destroyed.|`|90MSfEGSaa	yes|`|7nRJb2qCaa	Well, I think they're starting to go a bit overboard with the whole situation.|`|ZO8tWC6aaa	because she's famous!!!<br>  and it does bring awareness to the cause

rwGTRUj0aa	toby flenderson. or kevin malone.|`|ZmYoOhaiaa	Jim!!!|`|l1iMHPK5aa	Dwight Schrute is the most hilarious character. I like Jam couple, too, they look so good together.|`|pfIrLQxpaa	Creed. With all the other characters, they really have to set up a part to be funny. The audience has a pretty good idea where they get their motivations from, and what drives them. Creed has maybe 1 or two lines every episode, that for me, turn out to be some of the funniest things i've ever heard. Things like "creed sold me a tapeworm" and then creed responds to a camera with "it wasn't a tapeworm" can you get anymore awesome! things like "sounds like the tide at omaha beach" when Jan describes her tub birth...i love that show

NfA7nDQkaa	Here are my favourites in order:<br>  <br>  <br>  From Far Away (Kanata Kara) <br>   MANGA <br>  the first manga i ever really read, it has an amazing storyline, and some of the most amazing characters that i've seen.  It's only 14 volumes long, meaning there are no stupid plot twists and that it wasn't dragged on for too long.  there is action, romance supernatural and a sweet plot line.<br>  Story: 17 year old noriko was out with her friends one day when a terrorist bomb ctapoults her into another world where she is what is known as the awakening - a creature that will suposedly unlease a terrifying dewstructive force on the entire world.  but what happens when this force rescues her and she finds herself falling in love with him?<br>  this one is actually only a manga, as it wasn't long enough to become an anime nor did it have a large enough fan base at the time of it's release.   <br>  ***trust me, i know my summary isn't the best, but even though it isn't the most widely known manga, almost everyonw who reads finds themselves falling in love with it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Special A<br>  ANIME and MANGA<br>  this one is hilarious! had me laughing like crazy. it has one of those super-dense but totally awesome main characters who you just want to yell at for totally not realizing this one guy is in love with her! you can watch the whole thing on youtube subbed<br>  <br>  <br>  W Juliet<br>  MANGA<br>  really romantic and sweet.  the lead male character has been forced into making a deal with his father; if he can switch schools and remain in desguise as a girl without anyone realizing that he is a guy then he's free from all responsability and can pursue his dream of becoming actor.  the main lead character, an extremely popular tom boy named ito discovers his secret and becomes his best friend.  one of the more romantic ones that i've read.  really sweet and there's a sequel.<br>  <br>  Chrono Crusade<br>  ANIME and MANGA<br>  super funny, very cute, so sad you have to cry.  Rosetta is *like* a nun, who has made a contract with a demon/her best friend to find a way to rescue her apostle brother from the clutches of evil.   she and her friends battle these demons in hand to hand combat leaving a trail of destruction accross new yorl [i think it was new york anyway lol]<br>  <br>  <br>  Ultra Maniac<br>  ANIME and MANGA<br>  i didn't actually watch the anime of this one, i just read the manga. once again it's cute and funny.  more modern and up-to-date but still involves some magic. very cute and has multiple couples.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Karin<br>  ANIME and MANGA<br>  karin is a vampire who is a bit backwards -- she loves the sunlight, produces excess blood rather than having to obtain it from someone else, and loves humans.  really quite cute and funny, though not the best i've seen.|`|fKcr6KU0aa	"Bokura ga Ita" is really, really pretty in terms of graphics, IMHO, and has a good romance storyline.  I also recommend "Honey and Clover" (more of a college comedy/drama than a romance, but some romantic elements) and "Kare Kano" (His and Her Circumstances).<br>  <br>  You can watch the first ep of each here:<br>  Bokura ga Ita: <a href="http://www.veoh.com/collection/s473331/watch/e148500eAyBEn8Y" rel="nofollow">http://www.veoh.com/collection/s473331/w...</a><br>  Honey and Clover: <a href="http://www.veoh.com/collection/s473331/watch/e148500eAyBEn8Y#watch%3Dv14077100Byk9qHCf" rel="nofollow">http://www.veoh.com/collection/s473331/w...</a><br>  Kare Kano: <a href="http://www.veoh.com/collection/s473331/watch/e148500eAyBEn8Y#watch%3Dv1518155hZSX6BpQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.veoh.com/collection/s473331/w...</a>|`|nQ8UeSdGaa	Lots!

Angel Sanctuary is an epic love story that not only transcends life, but also the characters themselves on so many levels.<br>  <br>  And Furuba (fruitsbasket) is just adorable in so many ways... you sympathise so much with all parts of the love triangle. Plus the guys are so angsty and cute.<br>  <br>  I like Ouran Highschool club because the twins love for the main character is also an issue with breaking out of each others company and coming into terms of identity- it reflects the discovering of self involved in falling in love. <br>  <br>  And Full Metal Panic is just fun and flirty.|`|rc7GbYx9aa	vampire knight nice story and sad too and because ZERO!! ?? :P<br>  <br>  fruits basket cute story and kyo is there =] ??<br>  <br>  shugo chara is a VERY cute story and love the characters IKUTO !! ??<br>  <br>  ouran hhc  is a good story too the beginning is w/e but the story get better in the middle and the twins are awesome <br>  <br>  inuyasha -- -- love his pupy side :P|`|PYUVHnfMaa	Skip Beat, Ouran High Host Club, & Fruits Basket.

Not one of the usual bad guys in Batman's rogue's gallery, but he has the potential to bring in the next DC franchise, a Suicide Squad film.  <br>  <br>  Other possible villains:<br>  <br>  Manbat- commentary on genetic research might throw open a whole new round of political debate.<br>  <br>  Scarface- hard to cast this one, but consider that creepy ventriloquist dummy from "Magic." Frank Oz hasn't been on screen much in the last decade and he is a natural with puppets.<br>  <br>  Solomon Grundy-  Lots of potential for this one, especially if the Creeper gets involved.|`|Z1HLUP6daa	First of all, they should leave the Joker out of it. Heath Ledger's Joker was phenomenal. <br>  <br>  I also don't think they should bring in any of the female villains. None of them are heavy enough for Nolan. They all just prance around and provide the sex appeal. <br>  <br>  It kind of seemed like they had a set up for the Riddler, seeing as Edward Nigma, E.Nigma was the original, and Mr. Reese who was introduced in the Dark Knight, ...Mysteries. I don't know if they'll play that out, but it's just an interesting little tidbit.

u86NV1Enaa	Jackie Kennedy said it so right:  "The One Thing I do not want to be called is First Lady. It sounds like a saddled horse."<br>  <br>  In modern times a Lady is a Powerful woman, a woman that makes equal wages, positions, and authorities.<br>  In modern times there's Four Things a woman should know:<br>  -How to look like a girl.<br>  -Think like a man.<br>  -Work like a dog.<br>  -And, on top of all that: Act Like a Lady...<br>  <br>  So, Dear Lady:<br>    "Be cautious of Cupid,<br>  List well to the lines of this verse,<br>  To be kissed by a fool is stupid,<br>  To be fooled by a kiss is worse."|`|M48kbO2Yaa	Whereas a lady used to reflect a woman of royal or noble lineage, in modern terms, a lady is a state of being and behavior, in essence, it's a noun that is a verb. A lady is polite, carries herself with dignity, acts in a fashion that reflects well on her upbringing, and is respected for her bearing.<br>  <br>  A lady is practical but not necessarily cheap. That is to say, she surrounds herself with quality and abstains from filling her life with the unnecessary and things lacking in quality. She has enough china and serving trays to entertain guests or associates. She has clothing for all occasions. She will not buy down, just to save a buck, but she won't buy just to spend a buck, either. She is educated and knowledgeable of contemporary topics, so she is an elegant hostess.<br>  <br>  A lady dresses herself in a way that accentuates her femininity without being tawdry or lowering her station. She dresses to the best of her ability with class and traditional values, but there is no mistaking that she is a woman.<br>  <br>  Composed, a lady will bear her emotions with dignity, knowing that others may be needing her to be stable. Loss of composure is impolite and could disgrace friends and acquaintances. The concept of a "lady" has fallen out of practice in modern culture, because, unfortunately, it is associated with classism.<br>  <br>  I, personally, have no problem with class structured society, as long as it doesn't mean the maltreatment of people in other classes. We should all be striving to improve our station, or at least we should be acting it.<br>  <br>  Peace and prosperity.|`|w3mLyLQ8aa	* A woman who is refined, polite, and well-spoken.....<br>  * a woman of high social position or economic class<br>  * (in Great Britain) the proper title of any woman whose husband is higher in rank than baronet or knight, or who is the daughter of a nobleman not lower than an earl (although the title is given by courtesy also to the wives of baronets and knights).|`|Ry4Jc96Aaa	Term used to describe a type of female that is: <br>  <br>  - Easy to bang <br>  - Takes money for sex <br>  - Disappointed male does not get any|`|OfHoaWf7aa	A woman who is refined, classy, well bred and wears modest clothes (vs trashy).|`|ukRpBJ6Daa	idk. check a dictionary|`|b548e7d83e76abff190cad24e43b0ecaaa	just about any female of the human species who was born with a pu****|`|n5Dqb5JZaa	Any female that is 30 or older.|`|f3QeLCZUaa	Law abiding duty bound  young woman|`|Z1HLUP6daa	Not Gaga or Sovereign.|`|a991rHLjaa	A female within the age range of 13-25?|`|7kiwVKVUaa	a stuck up ***** no offense to girls or women|`|UjPArJZ6aa	The ones who swallow...<br>  <br>  Spitting is not ladylike...|`|U7d3Ft9baa	it is a woman from 30 years of age.|`|OPKbGXUFaa	<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lady" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.ph...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  That apparently.|`|ckj8O1TNaa	tramp, prostitue, hoe, stutt, hooker|`|ib00OjJXaa	someone extremely proper with manners but is stuck up.|`|AMFajJCgaa	Pre op or post op?
jFESUkWBaa	When a girl is exclusively dating another woman, that makes her a LESBIAN! Lindsey has confirmed that she is going out with this girl and hasn't been dating anyone else. Therefore, she is, by definition, a lesbian!    I'll give you a perfect example. I am a lesbian. When I was younger I was strait, at least I thought I was. I started going out with girls in college, but until I met my current girlfriend, I was still seeing other guys. Now that I am in a relationship with my girlfriend, I am indeed, a lesbian. Doesn't matter that I've slept with guys before. I'm a lesbian!    Now here's the more important question... why do you care?|`|lHzBJA4eaa	No, she's just being an idiot.Now Pink, there's a lesbian.|`|qOKFuXfLaa	what's the point? She is in a lesbian relationship now.   take your chill pills ho|`|mZUXkeyRaa	Yeah, I think she is Bi too!  I used to think that she was just dating Sam for publicity  But I dont know now  She probably is Bi|`|Fyt9JxTqaa	Why? Do you have a problem with lesbians?   Lindsay isn't completely a lesbian, since she's dated guys before but she still isn't straight.|`|kLNhAEVpaa	I agree; my conclusion from the second I found out about Ronson was that she was bi because she had gone out with VERY many guys before that. I don't know why people immediately label her a lesbian. Just goes to show how judgmental people can be.|`|BZmlBM27aa	I think she's just experimentig.

I don't understand why you are taking it so seriously.   If someone says 'Lindsay is a lesbian' who cares? You're acting like there's something wrong with that when there isn't. Yeah, she could be bisexual but is it really that big of a deal if someone calls her a lesbian when she's infact bisexual? Get a grip!|`|crwV0sdKaa	Uh..... because she got married to a girl.  You don't have to say she is a lesbian, but by just saying that she is married to a girl makes her not straight.... it's not bad or anything, it's just the truth.  |`|F338culUaa	I So Agreee     She's Not A Lesbo She's A Bi!|`|8ff45c0998366633e2e690fcdcdf5a92aa	exactly! she's dated a bunch of guys too, so isn't she bisexual? ...i mean just because she's "dating" samantha doesn't mean that she's completely ruled out the idea of dating guys

7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	I'm not sure what his name is, but I know I remember seeing him sing a few more songs on Youtube and yes, it is from a home studio. He also did Stay by Sugarland. I don't remember the other songs, but that one I remember him changing the words a little bit. Maybe this will jog someone's memory a bit more. I'll star it in case one of my contacts has heard of it.
Bgqi0pOuaa	As far as the movie goes, they break the work schedule and follow McMurphy's lead to watch the world series--even though the TV is not turned on.<br>  <br>  The fishing trip is an important scene where the men taste some freedom from the institution.<br>  <br>  Cheswick complains a lot more under McMurphy's influence.  Actually, other patients begin to question Nurse Ratched more frequently since McMurphy came around as well.<br>  <br>  The whole party scene at the end pretty much flaunts the system.<br>  <br>  The very last scene is Chief destroying what has kept him institutionalized.  (And Tabor seems to really like it.)<br>  <br>  Read the book.  Hard to believe, but so much better...
R5mmX9Woaa	I like it - even when they are bad dreams. It makes it more fun to tell people about when you wake up.

Go Taylor!|`|AA11989999	I like it, good or bad, 'cuz you can get a different perspective. Yours is sibling rivalry, and it happens. Being attracted to you, he might also think your sister is hot. Not that he will do anythinmg about it, but you can be aware of the possibility.|`|mQlkWTkTaa	I love dreams. Dreams that make me feel good when i wake up and when good things happen! But when scary things happen or anything bad happens, it makes me think why I might be feeling this way... <br>  I heard that dreams show your inner hidden emotions and explain them better. ive had some scary ones that confused me alot. But really good dreams likeee meeting my heroes or something like that, I love!|`|mh5NOsWzaa	indifferent really, i mean deams come from your brain. Your brain basically defines your perception of reality so there no question as to how real dreams feel|`|8eeN89h3aa	it depends on what the dreams about...|`|t3A9qpQIaa	I pay attention to vivid dreams, it's usually problem solving and your subconscious mind wants you to resolve it. <br>  Try this; the crush is you.  You are not looking at the right person.  Direct your attention to someone else in your circle of friends or acquaintences.

It's easier than learning the guitar because the fingerings are easier but it still takes technique, memorization, and a ton of practice. If you want to learn you have to be committed to it.     I would say it is worth learning.

If he doesn't eat anything, he starts getting angry and starts punching holes in the wall.  One day, I asked him to stop, but all he could blabber on about was how those sauceless chicken wings from KFC are so good that he would give up a lung to have just one.    I decided to be nice, and I bought some for him one day to bring to work.  He grabbed the box out of my hand and finished 20 wings in 2 minutes and 16 seconds.  He then started punching more holes in the wall out of joy.    I'm just not sure what to do anymore.  There are so many holes in the wall that I can see other people in other rooms talking about how this one guy's neighbor didn't like black people.|`|HEQc83d9aa	I would give it to my dentist!

DjifToZgaa	I get what you're saying.<br>  <br>  In fairness, it is the Supporting Actor role.  <br>  <br>  And, he did one hell of a job.  He was downright disturbing.  Hoffman and Brolin did enough to deserve it as well, but I doubt they would begrudge Ledger's legacy given the fine performance.|`|u25R7XIGaa	That's the attention factor for his performance. He's going to win awards because his performance was truly fantastic; I'm a harsh critic, I study acting, and I hate that kind of movie, and it was amazing. You really need to see it. He actually does deserve all of the awards, and I wouldn't say that if it wasn't true; I just don't do that. He pulled the audience into the movie and the character, and his character was a PSYCHOPATH. That's NOT easy to make people understand, and he did it. If you're not firmly decided that you won't be impressed, you'll be amazed, and even if you are you'll still be unable to admit it.|`|6tGYe5roaa	I get what you are saying, and it wouldn't be fair if he was receiving it only because of sympathy. But I really do not think that is the case. I believe that only one other person has won an Academy Award posthumously. So giving it out for sympathy is really not their style.<br>  <br>  Heath Ledger did an amazing job as the Joker. You couldn't even tell it was him. He completely transformed into his character. If he does win, I think he deserves it.|`|lU12YtI2aa	Well I am sure many will say it was a sympathy vote win, BUT I have to go along with the majority here.  I think he Deserves the Oscar.  I went to see the Dark Knight expecting his role to be overly praised & finding it a letdown. (even though I have always been a BIG Ledger fan)<br>  I was totally won over by his portrayal of the Joker....an Outstanding job!  I do not think anyone could have played it better.  I even know someone who is an actor that thinks he should get the Oscar, even if he was still living.|`|gwKxe7gGaa	I do agree that he is getting his fair share of sympathy, but you must understand that his performance in the dark knight was THE best acting job of 2008 and I don't think you can argue that.<br>  <br>  So is he getting "sympathy awards" possibly, but he's definitely getting awards he greatly deserves.|`|9N1mDGIJaa	i personally think that his performance was Oscar worthy, but i don't think he was the best of the other nominees. the fact that his death boosted his chances is sad for the other nominees and totally unfair.|`|2040myy2aa	did u see his last movie??? he did more then a good job i don't think anyone could have done a better job he had like the best parts in the movie i think he should get it but about the sympathy part idk i don't think it is because of that|`|fZEVgFe8aa	Well he hasn't won it yet.  But I actually think he kinda deserves it for his performance as the Joker in Dark Night.  Check out his movie 'Candy' for another moving performance.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Is it sympathy factor?<br>  <br>  His Joker performance was awesome - he even managed to scare me. (Which is quite an accomplishment).<br>  So if he gets an award - it will be well deserved for that role.|`|AA10554783	I think he did a great job in the film but its worth nothing to him, he can't enjoy it, Past it on.|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	I don't think that's the only reason though...he was excellent as the joker. He deserves recognition for it...whether he's dead or alive.  I see where your coming from though.

a4fb671bdeb9d97a5ca6b59c2e09d198aa	As Brittany stated, your Venus, Mars, Rising and Moon signs have a lot to do with it. But in general, libra women like a guy who can be romantic in any sense. Most libras love the whole array of romance, and want a guy who can do it all from the old stand-bys of chocolates flowers and candles... to someone who can bring you on a most thoughtful and maybe even unconventional date. If you try to pick up on the subtle clues a libra woman leaves you you will be treated like gold!     Remember, Libras love to try to create balance and as such are not always as forthcomming with the info as some may like to be. They will however always hint at what they want. I have often found myself talking in a theoretical way on how nice it would be to go do this or that and thankfully my man can figure out that I really mean "hey honey, bring me here and I would jsut aboslutely love it... please please can we go?!" LOL    So being able to read in between the lines is key to getting a libra. Also helpful are goals about your future, able to research and make plans but remain just ever so flexible in the rare case your libra wants to do something else, and of course a devotion to trying to get to know her.|`|uxwSd0KLaa	LIke Brittney said Libra differ from one another ; I am a Libra and just buy the little bits of information of Brittney ; I am very different from her ; for me a man has to be spiritual ; honest and good worker [ Money was the least of my problem ]|`|0HGqGJYTaa	I don't think I can speak for Libra women in general when you consider venus, mars, and rising signs.    Generally, I like a guy with class, money, and confidence. I know when a guy is unsure of himself and is hoping to get it right? I hate that.     Based on my venus and mars, I have a thing for bad boys.|`|OzfrMg9qaa	yo brittany hit the nail on the head class money and confidence. Im a libra woman also|`|5l5eCRdOaa	Buy her clothes and spoil her rotten.

KbnUq585aa	Time and space don't allow me to fully enumerate my experiences with Dr.s; too many unnecessary and expensive visits(and tests), mostly just to get common sense information. Difficulty diagnosing is one part but the majority has always been people who are too egotistical and proud(and greedy)to simply admit they don't know, that someone else could do better. The self-confidence to do such an important job too often means they just don't worry or even wonder how they actually effect you. ALWAYS check as many sources as you can to know what that Dr is actually like; State medical board/disciplinary and court records; any search engine results about people/facilities; ALWAYS request ALL records and information to research what they're saying actually means, specific tests and procedures, cost included. You can never know too much about your health; you may never be more sorry you didn't.|`|HCHqzkQraa	No, <br>  but I read up on diagnosis <br>  try to eat and live healthy<br>  read to be knowledgeable on symptoms that may be a possibility of health problems<br>  read about diet <br>  and read about medications that are prescribed<br>  <br>  <br>  I am still seeking answers for a traumatic brain injury, reading recommended books and articles, and learning how to live with the consequences of my injury.|`|CIhpkxGyaa	absolutely<br>  <br>  especially if they are young and stuck up<br>  <br>  im sure they would lie and risk peoples lives to save their jobs<br>  <br>  my health is awesome|`|IB36yrr6aa	My health fit and fine, I walk daily 7-8 km which help me to keep my body fit and healthy.|`|81d1878d304b3dc1a8e455b4341b7a24aa	yeah hi can of do.<br>  <br>  Well you need the right doctors to dignose the right illness otherwise they will tell you are all right.<br>  <br>  I had chronic pain from athritis at my neck.

They took an MRI and they said it could be a magrain, so it went to neuroligiest, he gave me medicen but it did not work.<br>  <br>  Finally i went to a pain specialiest and discovered anthritis at my neck which cause my headaches.|`|rfxSQbwuaa	no but cycology student|`|uiGVViTJaa	nope.<br>  good.<br>  spank yah fur askin'  (:|`|2mlHf7Opaa	You mean "distrust"?

NrOuDXW4aa	Neither would rank in the top 10 best war movies ever made but Thin Red Line is better than SPR.  Saving Private Ryan is a look at how the war would have been run if it had been organized by a movie production company.  If you really want an answer to your question try asking a real war veteran you may be surprised at the answer.|`|240e85ac1f26271b71217ebbf8ba3a79aa	Saving Private Ryan<br>  <br>  Thin Red Line is honestly the only movie I have ever fallen asleep during. That says a lot for a movie fanatic like me. The plot was just a total bore. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, SPR was a little twisty, kind of predictable but, it had a good story, great war/battle scenes and a good balance of drama and violence. Also, although I am not an American (I'm Canadian), it really shows a good sense of patriotism that almost made me feel like I knew the Americans. Overall, I was never bored.|`|56bNLJykaa	The Thin Red Line|`|qpln6o9Yaa	I think Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war movies ever made.|`|rJ8kLGgkaa	Thin Red Line, based on reality.  SPR as a movie, with a story line, exciting events, etc.  Fact is, nobody ever came out of a movie unable to function very well as a human being.  Look at some of the returning Iraqi vets and even Vietnam vets.  The D-day landing in SPR captures some of the insanity of combat.  TRL is more realistic in the pace of how things develop.  If you saw SPR, TRL, Platoon, Deer Hunter, and Apocolypse Now in sequence you might begin understand.  But you would not be required to fight back during that period, and at the end the walls of the theater would still be standing.  As you can guess, my comments are not theoretical.|`|MQIc7X0Zaa	saving private ryan is the most awesome movie but also the most relistic movie ever. like blood all over the place and interestion combos of cuss words|`|MNyYWoFfaa	Definitely Saving Private Ryan.  Thin Red Line was slow and skipped around too much.<br>  <br>  Another good one is Enemy at the Gates...a movie from a Soviet Union sniper's point of view|`|ScbEzhKiaa	Saving Private Ryan. I wasn't a big war movie goer before I saw that and It just made me wanna see more (good ones).|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	Neither.  Tora Tora Tora or A Bridge Too Far.  Based on actual events.  I would include Midway if you ignore the Hollywood fictional love story (the total failure of Pearl Harbor).|`|WpqwaqcQaa	Saving Private Ryan is much better movie.<br>  <br>  TRL tries to be a war movie and a psychological thriller, it does neither well
JQXFG2ABaa	I really hope she does.
LuWT8KQBaa	Yes.

You know drums here, guitar here......|`|TKsYoM26aa	they do you just dont notice actually. back then things were recorded analog so you only had the option of setting something to only come out of the left speaker on the mixer and you can change it as the song goes by messing with the dial but thats kind of a hassle. but now we can do that digitally and with more precision.     but today with guitar what someone would do is guitar 1 in left speaker and guitar 2 in right speaker. they could be the same but the main point is to cover the range of tones used by the 2 different guitarists. so if the 2nd guitarist is actually playing a lead in the song then someone just has to record the same thing guitar 1 would be doing with a different amp and put it in the other speaker with a slight bleed(thats where the 2 sounds kind of mix together). but even that last bit can be skipped digitally these days.    but thats one recording style. some producers might not do that.|`|0vm66wlcaa	It creates a cool kind of listening environment.

733da09d0cb9e9d0f08ae79290ca1491aa	no favourite....but i do love this one...    Sweet Home Alabama" by Kid Rock...       ?It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long  Caught somewhere between a boy and man  She was seventeen and she was far from in-between  It was summertime in Northern Michigan  Ahh Ahh Ahh  Ahh Ahh Ahh    Splashing through the sand bar  Talking by the campfire  It's the simple things in life, like when and where  We didn't have no internet  But man I never will forget  The way the moonlight shined upon her hair    [Chorus:]  And we were trying different things  We were smoking funny things  Making love out by the lake to our favorite song  Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow  Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long  Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long    Catching Walleye from the dock  Watching the waves roll off the rocks  She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul  We'd blister in the sun  We couldn't wait for night to come  To hit that sand and play some rock and roll    While we were trying different things  And we were smoking funny things  Making love out by the lake to our favorite song  Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow  Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long  Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long    Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change  Or how we thought those days would never end  Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along  And think man I'd love to see that girl again    [Repeat Chorus x2]    Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long  Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long  Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long  Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long?|`|GIC32UCSaa	Cowboy, Bawitdaba, All Summer Long|`|CO2o0YYMaa	All Summer Long and Picture (his duet with Sherryl Crow).|`|bw1Uc8icaa	kid rock SUCKS! listen to some REAL music!!!|`|0b3fa313a09fd3b8730664822eb4455baa	"All Summer Long," "Cold and Empty," "Devil Without A Cause," "Cowboy," "Amen," "Half Your Age," + "Picture w/ Sherryl Crow"|`|x49Lpr4raa	none cause hes a homo|`|NoEInGweaa	wasting time, forever, cowboy|`|yS61H04haa	Awww.

0kTbs879aa	Well I think its kind of heart warming that you are worried about Rob's happiness. I am a big RPattz fan and I think that it would be one of the worst things ever if he stopped acting, even more so if he stopped performing his music. Even though he has done some other films this is the biggest one he has ever been in. I think for the most part he is just in shock. He did not think it would be that big. He had never heard of the book so he just did fathom that he would build the fan base that he did over that one movie. If there is one thing that I am not worried about when it comes to Rob is that I dont think he will be one of those young stars that turns to drugs to cope. Rob is a very laid back person and when things get to be too much for him he just goes home to London. He is famous all over the world but over there at least he is not being screamed at 24/7. I think the mass amount of popularity scares him, mostly because he just doesnt understand it. It was something that literally happened over night for him. Rob loves to act and thats why he takes "off beat" roles and tries different things. I dont believe that Robs goal is to win all these awards and be some big A-List actor at the end of the day, I think he just wants to do what he enjoys and play roles that he enjoys. I dont think a little popularity is going to scare him away from the business. As far as his music, he plays for himself not for fans. He has said that he was really surprised and flattered to be on the soundtrack. But that was not something he was aiming to do. He also said that he isnt trying to make some big time musical career and put out CD's. That just not the type of person he is. I think that he enjoys making music with his friends and doing little live performances at the pubs he goes to. I dont think he is upset that people are sharing his music with others, we cant all be at the bar lol we all wouldnt fit! I think its when people invade his personal space that upsets him. No one likes to feel like they have to hide out just to avoid being mobbed. This is all new for the fans as well, eventually it will calm down and become a little bit more tolerable. Rob is a humble talented laid back man, I dont think 13yrs old screaming girls can scare him off!!|`|XR0VnlXjaa	I think as soon as Rob is finished with filming The Twilight Sagas, gradually change will happen for him, I hope.  To be honest, I don't think he is prepared for this huge fame, though he earned it, big time.  Eventually, Rob will probably be diminished just like with all the old boy band hypes that happened in the late 90's.  I wish him the best though.  I hope things will get better for him.  Obsession kills.|`|18RphOP6aa	I to am a big fan....and I have noticed that he seems uncomfortable with his sudden fame but I think it's just because he's not used to it and it's going to take time....at least I hope that's all it is.<br>  I would hate to see him turn to drugs to deal...|`|240e85ac1f26271b71217ebbf8ba3a79aa	I love Robert Pattinson as an actor and I think that I would be really, really disappointed if he were to leave the film industry but honestly? I wouldn't really care too much. If he's not ready for the fame that being a huge celebrity brings, then maybe he shouldn't be there or maybe he just needs more time to cope with being a mega star. Quite frankly though, everyone knows that being a celebrity means having a minimal private life. Everyone is going to know everything about him. <br>  <br>  But look at yourself, you look for any bit of information about him when you get the chance.. isn't that similar to intruding on his private life? I'm not saying that YOU alone are being wrong, I'm just saying that in general, everyone should leave the celebs alone and stop looking for info on their private lives (gossip magazines or the internet), then maybe people like Rob Pattinson would feel less like a neon billboard and more like a normal person. <br>  <br>  Honestly speaking here, I knew he was uncomfortable in the spotlight when I was watching his live interview on Much Music. If I were in his shoes and if he really was incredibly hateful of the attention, then yes, I would maybe do a few more movies before quitting... it just depends on how fast I get to my breaking point.|`|fpuHVNYgaa	He's new to all this and it's kind of scary going from nobody to really somebody.Not being able to go anywhere without being harassed.I think that he will finish the Twilight movies and then try something besides acting or singing.

3ad05f51839ba1e01125f9c9a1ac29a9aa	A long, long time ago   I can still remember   How that music used to make me smile   And I knew if I had my chance   That I could make those people dance   And maybe they'd be happy for a while   But February made me shiver   With every paper I'd deliver   Bad news on the doorstep   I couldn't take one more step   I can't remember if I cried   When I read about his widowed bride   But something touched me deep inside   The day the music died     So bye-bye Miss American Pie   Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry   And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye   Singin' this'll be the day that I die   This'll be the day that I die     Did you write the Book of Love   And do you have faith in God above   If the Bible tells you so?   Now, do you believe in rock 'n' roll?   Can music save your mortal soul?   And can you teach me how to dance real slow?   Well, I know that you're in love with him   'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym   You both kicked off your shoes   Man, I dig those rhythm 'n' blues   I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck   With a pink carnation and a pickup truck   But I knew I was out of luck   The day the music died     I started singin'   Bye-bye Miss American Pie   Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry   Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye   And singin' this'll be the day that I die   This'll be the day that I die     Now, for ten years we've been on our own   And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone   But, that's not how it used to be   When the jester sang for the king and queen   In a coat he borrowed from James Dean   And a voice that came from you and me   Oh, and while the king was looking down   The jester stole his thorny crown   The courtroom was adjourned   No verdict was returned   And while Lenin read a book on Marx   The quartet practiced in the park   And we sang dirges in the dark   The day the music died     We were singin'   Bye-bye Miss American Pie   Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry   Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye   And singin' this'll be the day that I die   This'll be the day that I die     Helter-skelter in a summer swelter   The birds flew off with a fallout shelter   Eight miles high and fallin' fast   It landed foul on the grass   The players tried for a forward pass   With the jester on the sidelines in a cast   Now, the half-time air was sweet perfume   While sergeants played a marching tune   We all got up to dance   Oh, but we never got the chance   'Cause the players tried to take the field   The marching band refused to yield   Do you recall what was revealed   The day the music died?     We started singin'   Bye-bye Miss American Pie   Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry   Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye   And singin' this'll be the day that I die   This'll be the day that I die     Oh, and there we were all in one place   A generation lost in space   With no time left to start again   So, come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick   Jack Flash sat on a candlestick   'Cause fire is the devil's only friend   Oh, and as I watched him on the stage   My hands were clenched in fists of rage   No angel born in Hell   Could break that Satan's spell   And as the flames climbed high into the night   To light the sacrificial rite   I saw Satan laughing with delight   The day the music died     He was singin'   Bye-bye Miss American Pie   Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry   Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye   Singin' this'll be the day that I die   This'll be the day that I die     I met a girl who sang the blues   And I asked her for some happy news   But she just smiled and turned away   I went down to the sacred store   Where I'd heard the music years before   But the man there said the music wouldn't play   And in the streets the children screamed   The lovers cried and the poets dreamed   But not a word was spoken   The church bells all were broken   And the three men I admire most   The Father, Son, and The Holy Ghost   They caught the last train for the coast   The day the music died     And they were singin'   Bye-bye Miss American Pie   Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry   And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye   Singin' this'll be the day that I die   This'll be the day that I die     They were singin'   Bye-bye Miss American Pie   Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry   Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye   Singin' this'll be the day that I die    one of my best favorite songs my sweet pie...z|`|wP8LxHP9aa	"American Pie" are words that rhyme nicely with "bye bye".

Almost every weekend when not on, a bunch of us would go down there.  One late evening, after a day of sun and swim, as a joke, a couple of the guys left early and took all our gear with them.  So the rest of us just walked up the road to the helicopter airfield and asked them to fire up one.    We stood a few feet away as the pilot revved her up a little bit.

d5zEYomEaa	I don't like Jason or the 2 remaining. He turned me off the way he led Jillian on after he himself said he didn't like having been led on by Deanna. He kept giving her opportunities to say how much she loved him and would hold her hands and kiss her and when he gave her the boot he seemed very cold and sitant so that totally turned me off to him and I couldn't care less who he ends up with, especially with the 2 remaining girls. <br>  <br>  Molly is so annoying and cold and her lisp is unattractive. She slept with him in the tent and had sex on their first date so that's probably why he has been forced to keep her around so she doesn't throw a tantrum and spill the beans should he get rid of her. I could tell he doesn't like her and what was that with all those list of questions. Give me a break.<br>  <br>  Then Melisa couldn't even introduce him to her family and has never introduced any of her bf's to her friends before, it was just weird but obviously he likes her cuz she's a famous chearleade, what guy wouldn't, so they're a perfect match - neither deserve better.|`|fNXX2ss4aa	i love that show<br>  i think melissa (is that her name?)<br>  well the one with the dark hair <br>  the prettier one is gonna win <br>  if yeww saw the preview for the finale<br>  then its not the one with the kite<br>  its the one tht was telling jokes ndd stuff<br>  the one ty got along with really well<br>  they lukked like a little family :]|`|UriE3wN6aa	i think he should pick molly!

v1uqFBwiaa	When I see your smile,   Tears roll down my face   I can't replace.  (This line is basically explaining how much the writer loves the person he's talking about and how much he loves to see her smile)    And now that I'm strong, I have figured out,   How this world turns cold and it breaks through my soul.  And I know I'll find deep inside me,   I can be the one.  (Even though the world isnt always a good place, being with her makes living worthwhile)    I will never let you fall. (let you fall.)  I'll stand up with you forever.  I'll be there for you through it all. (through it all.)  Even if saving you sends me to heaven.  It's okay,   It's okay,   It's okay-ay-ay-ay-ay.  (This verse is saying that he would do anything to make sure shes okay, even risking his life to save hers)    Seasons are changing,   And waves are crashing,   And stars are falling all for us.  Days grow longer and nights grow shorter,   I can show you I'll be the one.   (This could also be another reference to the love he has for the person hes talking about. Hes saying all these huge things (stars are falling etc) are happening just for them. And he wants to prove that they are meant to be together)    I will never let you fall.  I'll stand up with you forever.  I'll be there for you through it all.   Even if saving you sends me to heaven.  (Already explained)    'Cause you're my, you're my, my-e-y-e-y,   My true love, my whole heart.  Please don't throw that away.  'Cause I'm here... for you!   Please don't walk away and,   Please tell me you'll stay!   (This line could be that the girl doesn't feel as strongly about her, and hes begging her to stay)    Use me as you will!   Pull my strings just for a thrill!   And I know I'll be okay,   Though my skies are turning grey!   (Hes saying that she can do and use him for anything and he'll still be happy even if she treats him badly)    I will never let you fall!   I'll stand up with you forever!   I'll be there for you through it all,   Even if saving you sends me to heaven!   (already explained)    Well thats what i think anyway. For other peoples views and opinions try www.songmeanings.net. I hope that helped a bit :)  Love the song by the way, it is mine and my girlfriends song. :)|`|xfh6ke3Vaa	it's about being a true friend, and being there for somebody through everything. this song describes my bestie!|`|sBlkL2bbaa	It's about how he loves someone who is sort of damaged and has a lot of emotional baggage. But he is going to stay with her and help her, and he would rather do that and suffer because of it than leave her. She is unstable and might try to leave, but he doesn't want her to.

9zMC6EBtaa	Yea, supposedly she left High Hefner because they were unable to have children. I don't know why that was such a shock to her, because, hello! he is flippin' old. Her and Kendra both left the mansion and are both rumored to be dating other men already. Kendra is dating a football player and they are getting married and Holly has been linked to Criss Angel. Eww from one gross guy to the next!|`|YSiANtECaa	You might feel sad about it but YES Holly Has Left the Mansion ... I just saw her the other day at chilli's !!|`|m2vBJaHKaa	Yea thats such an old story ,shes dating Criss Angel already|`|UHip02Gxaa	Yes.  So has Kendra.  The twins have moved in.|`|AUsvrW8faa	Yes|`|yp8NtB0faa	I don't kno but i think so. Last i knew heff's wife was moving back in and so were the twins|`|1DT7OUuHaa	Yeah, Holly and Hugh Hefner split up.  I believe that she and Kendra left the show but Bridget is staying for another season but I could be wrong (I'm sure that Holly has left though).  Holly really wanted kids and I don't think Hugh wanted kids again or fertility treatments weren't working for them. He's found himself some new girls already as I'm sure you've heard.   I wish Holly luck.   Here's some sites to catch up with what's going on with "The Girls Next Door" and Holly!  http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2008/1...  http://www.eonline.com/on/shows/girlsnex...  http://www.hollymadison.com/ (she looks way different on her website!)|`|EY7xhPJnaa	Oh my yes, there are rumors that she is engaged to Criss Angel...|`|1UMjdQ4Laa	yepp shes dating cris angel
92VH41EZaa	you have such a pretty voice =)  its so soft and ... flexible? is that the right word?  i dunno but yeah its great XD course you can sing!    i mean theres obviously room for improvement but with some more practice and training you could go really far !   i'd love to be able to sing like that ^-^    definatly not crappy.  xx xx xx|`|nWmaaqD8aa	your ok i wont say  your bad it just with the high notes u need to get them up then u will be ok|`|OnNJoKdlaa	I think your good, a lot better than me.|`|iM82M15Iaa	you should breath a little more too.|`|dBAuX8hwaa	Your in luck. I'm a grade 6 singer.  And i've listened to your song and I think your doing well and you just need to work on your pitch and your going off tune a little bit but that is easily solved. I think you should take up singing lessons if you are not already doing so. You have 8 grades and then you can get a diploma. Also a grade 5 is equal to a GCSE. (just a bit of handy info there)  Keep working on your tune & pitch and you'll do great =]|`|AQFwSLgiaa	You did good. Keep practicing. You have a natural talent and thats good. Get voice lessons to make your voice stronger and it will be even more powerful and you will kick butt!  :)|`|smIyyG7Xaa	hmm.. interesting .. it looks good.. you need to practice little more on continuation and high note.. all the best for your future in singing :) ...   btw , nice song huh :P|`|uJXeosHraa	you have a good basis, you should support a little more and hold your notes for their full length.|`|TisBxpygaa	I think you can sing pretty good but sound more happy
QnAEEmB3aa	Writing songs is very complex.  You should never just write a song for the sake of wanting your own song. You have to feel where the song is coming from, if you just pick something and start writing, your song will sound like a British entry for the Eurovision song contest, lol (you dont want that!).  A song should come to you, obviously, you can't just expect it to magically write itself down so you do require the intentions to write a song.    I hope this helps :)|`|AA12367393	pick a topic and then start writting|`|luSsPXi3aa	start out on a subject, and keep rhyming. rhyme words until u find one that makes sense. think of an amazing first line or chorus, and continue your song fromthere. listen to taylor swift, and you can kind of tweak some of her lyrics. or make a parody.|`|r5hNoQAgaa	Think of a topic, then begin to think how that person must feel ((if that is possible) it should naturally come to your head, then just make the words into sentences.
XzksDeE3aa	Well, find an instrument you are good at, and form a band with someone, or if you want to be a solo artist just go to a record label.|`|AA11896276	Talent  and hard work. And a little luck.|`|4dQjVb59aa	im sorry idk but if you find out plz tell me

What happened to real inventions?|`|767fd71f931856f7e4e2fe8bf027c74caa	Same reaction.

I think they look like the KKK in the robes. it ridiculous. so are the colors they come in. waste of your money. and so pointless. the name isn't too unique either. but i have to admit the commercial did make my day though.(:|`|6duSMXphaa	y cant people just buy a robe, its the same thing, when they say"your hands stay warm" the people are talking on the phone with their hands hanging out

To this date, I can only think of one movie that had me a little scared and that's 'The Exorcist'. The original, the follow up was crap. I wouldn't even waste my money on these so-called "scary movies" today. Like 'Friday The 13th'. That's a joke lol. I can't believe that they are still making movies about a guy that NEVER really dies lol. But I realize that it's a huge money maker for producers. Now I was impressed by the first 'Saw' movie.It held my attention, and had a shocking plot. See most of the time, I can predict what's going to happen in the films. So when one like 'Saw' comes along and stumps me, then I'm impressed.

1A4klmh7aa	I think the entire point of the series is that Harry *isn't* all that smart.<br>  <br>  He's not brilliant, he's not exceptionally talented, he's just lucky. That's not by mistake. It makes the character of Harry Potter extremely accessible to readers, because you don't have to be particularly bright to be able to relate to him. <br>  <br>  If he was the "chosen one" AND smart AND always beat the bad guy AND Dumbledore's favorite AND everything else, it would be excessive and annoying and unrealistic. <br>  <br>  J.K. Rowling made a very conscious decision to make him an average person, that is quite clear. That is why Hermione is so bright, why all of Harry's friends have special talents and strenghts that help him over the years. <br>  <br>  It's to make the point that you don't have to be "amazing" to be able to do good. <br>  <br>  Though, in Harry's defense, he did the best that he could. Yes, he was grumpy and sometimes mean to people. But look at how he was raised. He lived in a closet under the stairs for his entire childhood and was raised by people who hated him. When he finally went to school, he lacked the social and emotional skills to be able to cope with people being nice to him. He did the best that he could, I think, but if you grow up that way, you're going to have a hard time showing affection and compassion to others.<br>  <br>  He was also a teenager. Teenagers are moody, that's just a fact of life.<br>  <br>  And, he also spent seven years of his life being practically hunted by an evil wizard. Of COURSE he will be grumpy, you would be too.<br>  <br>  <br>  But no, he's not particularly smart or deserving of all the attention that he got. And that was the point.|`|jT1UU1CUaa	i think you're somehow stupid.|`|KPJ8uFuUaa	You can watch the trailer here <a href="http://thehotmovies.info/harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince-hd-trailer" rel="nofollow">http://thehotmovies.info/harry-potter-an...</a> <br>  :)|`|tITPAbeKaa	I don't think Harry Potter is stupid. I don't think he's exceptionally great either. He's just an ordinary kid to whom extraordinary stuff happens. I actually think he handles himself well, given the bizarre circumstances he finds himself in. <br>  <br>  Yes of course the other characters are some what more interesting. The thing is, Harry doesn't really have any specific characteristic. He's written in such a way that most people can identify him and feel like they are in Harry's place when they read the books.|`|LvywvZSeaa	I don't think his character is stupid...I mean if you think about it, he is a lot like your average teenager. He gets himself into trouble, he has a mouth sometimes, he's cocky sometimes, and he's moody. JUST like a teenager...which is what he is. I think Rowling did a great job of making him real.|`|AxkYUq56aa	You forgot Hermione.  She makes Harry look like a drooling idiot.  I think the fact that he's not the brightest or best behaved makes for a more interesting story, however, since perfect protagonists are mind numbingly boring.|`|10tQzTmmaa	No seeing as in the fifth movie voldemort is usually controlling him... in all the other movies he appreciates his friends. All the characters are extremely well thought up and j.k. Rowling did an excellent job keeping us at the edge of our seats while reading the books and seeing the movies. Snape is an enemy to harry and bullies him so harry doesn't take it. No wonder he's dumbledores favorite; mostly because they are so much alike. I think all the characters in that series are magnificent; especially harry and hermione:)|`|qK91Vd2Eaa	Whaaaaat? Ha are you kidding me harry potter is the shizzz and what are you talkin bout he's mean to ron? No he's not that's his best friend have you even read the books cause maybe you don't understand im assuming your talking about the order of pheonix movie? Yeah he's goin thru a lot in that movie he jus saw cedric die and he came face to face w/ voldamort plus he and voldamort were sharing visions and feelings that's why he was mean to ron he wasn't really himself at the time remember he says "I feel angry all the time.." Yeah dude don talk bout my harry man die hard hp fan lol|`|AA10905244	the main problem with Harry is his temper.. He can't control it.. He's so sensitive about all things.. He's ego-maniac.. You see in the beginning of book 5 when he first taunted dudley and dudley retorts with the cedric thingy.. he was the first one to flare up.. well, he's not my fave character.. I like Hermione and Luna better..|`|FsVZCk0laa	It's just a book..<br>  some people like to read about those kinds of things.<br>  I do tend to read the Harry Potter series if I have nothing better to read.<br>  <br>  But you can ask that same exact question about every single type of fictional book out there.<br>  (i.e. TWILIGHT.)|`|AA10761727	Ugh come on. That's your own opinion. It's just a book. Also, don't base your judgment on the movies. The real Harry Potter is the one in the books. If you delve in deep, you'll find that he's a good kid who cares.|`|btpoLu5kaa	I honestly hate Harry Potter (character) sometimes.<br>  I honestly love Harry Potter (series) all the time.<br>  <br>  Harry gets to be way too angsty for me very often.|`|I0rTPsN4aa	Just You Buddy. <br>  Here is a Great Word of Knowledge for you<br>  "Its the Sheer amount of Stupidity in You that asks Such Nonsense Questions publicly."<br>  by<br>  Me

lDBI2PoWaa	No =(<br>  CBS cancelled it after 16 episodes.  I was so sad because that show was amazing!  I don't know what they were thinking, the show had decent numbers especially for a Friday night.  Supposedly they felt it wasn't keeping enough of the Ghost Whisperers audience or something like that.  Then they go and put the Ex-List in it's time slot this year.  Look how that one turned out...it got like 3 episodes before being axed.  Seriously Moonlight was the People's Choice for Best New Series! Come ON!!! Haha well thanks for letting me vent.  And ya I don't like True Blood, it is no where near as good as Moonlight.  Mick St. John is like the hottest vampire ever!!!|`|HEs6bzOtaa	Yer moonlight was canceled in 2008 with only 16 episodes airing. <br>  That was such a good show, i really enjoyed it. And yes true blood is terrible compared to moonlight.

I'm really nervous to be driving that far (San Francisco to Anaheim) on Friday the 13th. I want to book a flight early on Saturday morning but she don't want to sooo we'll see...    I never walk under ladders and I'm afraid of breaking mirrors. I guess the only thing I'm not supersticious about would be black cats. I'v had a few.|`|7dGpL4mSaa	Not one bit. ;)|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Yes, somewhat.  I toss salt over my shoulder when I spill some. Tho I never remember which side to toss it, so I always do both. I'd never walk under a ladder.  My mom was super supersitious.  Always said it was bad luck to have your first visitor in the new year be a woman.

qPZPduLXaa	I'm not sure if this is what you're going for, but there is a blind character (Whistler) in the movie Sneakers. At one point, all the other characters are playing a video clip over and over, and Whistler is the one who figures it out and tells them were to look. At first they are skeptical because he is blind, but soon they see he is right.

It's not that simple.<br>  <br>  But if can help you for your paper, I listen to rap and have not been influenced to commit crimes (lines like "I am recognizing that the voices in my head are telling me to be myself and never follow no one else" don't have that effect on me, for some reason.)|`|XDvOwLlNaa	haha^^<br>  <br>  "he even had the nerve to cuss"...<br>  <br>  O....M....G.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	Any music has a negative effect on whoever listens to it and takes it the wrong way. if anyone does anything because of a rap song they are stupid as hell and this is coming from...well..look at the picture!<br>  Its just not good music and now adays its not even gangsta any more..lol..like Eazy E, or Tupac, or Biggie or the old Jay-z and Nas or the undergrounders! its all soft, "i wana have sex with chicks and pour champagne on ppl and throw up dolla bills." nothing you can do wrong with that bs.....<br>  <br>  either way any music can have that effect in anyone depending on how vulnerable that person is to immulate what they heard when they know it was not real.|`|YfIm4IqSaa	F--- rap already. The media glamourizes it like crazy. The media has been so pro rap ever since it came out. They tend to be far less talented than other types of artists -- too much sameness in rap. <br>  <br>  I think it's culturally harmful. Because the media is so supportive, it's popularized by young people of all ethnic groups and it just screws things up. <br>  <br>  There would probably be less prisons if it weren't for rap. BOOOOOO rap BOOOOOOOO. Just bang your heads instead, onto a wall.|`|eZCCSMykaa	music does have influence in everything<br>  <br>  i know people who are now cutting them selves and all that cause they listened to rock<br>  <br>  and i know people who joined sureno fontana gangs due 2 rap|`|GTWGVq1Vaa	NO, Parents need to raise there kids.........

VEScnfoHaa	I think drug users should attend more psychological services during prison than drug dealers, because they are mentally impaired from so much drug usage. Drug dealers would be treated differently, because most of the time they don't use the drugs that they sell. In another case where the drug dealer also does the drugs, he should also be treated likewise.|`|AA10832514	Yes, I do.  Drug users are sick because drug dealers supply them with the substance.  Drug users can get better and lead productive lives once they get their disease under control.  Using drugs isn't illegal.

lbXC4rkEaa	Because they were setting a trap. Didn't you see the memory wiper come out from hiding and take the guy out? They set up a trap through the letters, which they would eventually open. Dakota Fanning was told to just keep running. The old guy was told to, I imagine, follow her. I guess it was her destiny to eventually go there one way or another, so Nick made sure she was safe.<br>  <br>  Like I said for another question, the stereotypical, mindless Hollywood action flick wasn't written for a deep, involving plot.|`|NrOuDXW4aa	Its a piece of lite escapism, its not really necessary for it to make sense its just has to be an exciting piece of entertainment.  After all none of the powers these people have are real is why expect the rest of the movie to be realistic?<br>  <br>  If you enjoyed it be happy with that.  Incidentally in an interview Camille Belle was asked to describe the plot and got completely muddled so if even the actors in the movie can't work out the plot don't feel bad if you can't make sense of it either.

xbMxpBzaaa	Although harps come in a huge variety of shapes, sizes, and weights, they all consist of three main parts: the sound board (or box), the neck, and the strings. The modern Western harp is triangular in shape. Most harps are between two feet (60 cm) to six feet (1m.80) tall and have 22 to 47 strings. Smaller harps may sit on your lap, but larger ones usually rest on the floor. Their strings may be of gut, wire, or nylon, in one, two, three, or crossed ranks.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|2093a0b4a47a4c9d4f1fd59eee49bf21aa	David played it...it soothed King Saul.

p9YTs4GAaa	Why Chris Brown attacked Rihanna They got in the car right, and Chris wanted 2 pull over to "Take Her Down" but Rihanna said "Shut Up and Drive" So he got tight cuz he didnt get any in "Forever". He tried 2 cut the radio off and she grabbed his hand sayin "Please Dont Stop The Music." Chris tried to act all "Super Human" and push her shyt away and cut it off anyway.so she picked up an "Umbrella" and tried 2 hit him and he said "Gimme That." Then she bragged about how "Unfaithful" she was and this  said "YOOO" n spazzed out n tried to choke her so she could have "No Air" now she gotta go 2 "Rehab". <br>  <br>  It's really not that funny, honestly<br>  Someone getting abused is horrible|`|ZJ1w56kxaa	Chris brown and Rihanna where walking and it started to rain.<br>  and Rihanna was like Chris get under my "umbrella" and he was like no I think I will just "Run it" to the car. <br>  He get in the car and says hurry up your taking "forever" and she gets in the car and says "shut up and drive" <br>  he says your about to have "No air" and she says you wonder why I'm so "unfaithful" and he slams her from "wall to wall"<br>  THE END<br>  <br>  I got this in a txt .

361c70be0209ad9c5ef2d3e4577f11e5aa	In the U.S. 'Army Of Darkness' is scheduled for a May release.<br>  The first Evil Dead film was so low budget I don't know if it would merit a blu-ray release. I would suggest the picking up the 3 disc Ultimate Edition or the Book Of The Dead version(the squishy face you mentioned-they issued both 1 & 2 in this packaging).<br>  I don't know of any film series that has so many re-issues.<br>  <br>  There are Book Of The Dead versions for each of the first 2 movies, available as a 2 pack or individually. I don't think a package with all 3 films has ever been issued in the U.S..<br>  -And except for the first 20 minutes, 2 is NOT a remake of 1-after a certian point it picks up right where the first film ended|`|r9lfDeRmaa	I can't find anything on the first one being released on Blu-Ray however I did find the 3rd one Army of Darkness for rent on Blu-Ray so it should be out for purchase.|`|IARPr7k5aa	just a heads up if you haven't seen the movies, part 2 is a remake of part one. some people found part one too grotesque (i liked it). and the second one has a bigger budget. all in all they are all great movies!<br>   never had blu ray so not too sure which is better.

3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	It's certainly possible to get your tickets in a pre-sale, but you have to be in a position to hear about it.  There are three things you can do:    1) Get on Ticketmaster's mailing list.  They'll send you notifications of upcoming concerts in your area.  Also, you can check on Ticketmaster pretty much anytime to find out whether you can order tickets yet.    2) If you know of a local country radio station that will likely be involved in promoting the concert, get on that station's mailing list, and you'll get info of upcoming events, similar to Ticketmaster.    3) Similarly to  1 and  2 above, get onto Taylor's official website, and if she's got a fan club mailing list, sign up for it.    In my experience,  2 above is the best way to find out above a pre-sale, but the others are also worth a try.  Hope that helps!|`|RdRsQsiQaa	Whoa, no it's not possible to order those tickets now.  You will probably have to wait near the end of summer this year.    What you should do is go to her MySpace page:  http://www.myspace.com/taylorswift    & sign for Taylor's E-Mail List to get more info on when tickets are available.    Hope this help! [:|`|5c79f4b7bfee2481652ff5021a6a8d0daa	yea, normally tickets for a show go on sale around 2 months before the show and pre-sale normally starts 1 week before they go sale to the public. to get pre-sale codes and stuff from taylor (like stated above) they will e-mail it to you if you on on her e-mail list which you can join from her myspace! :)

This week she starts to get close to Ronnie, but when Ronnie breaks down and tells dot about her baby, dot suggests she should not go with danielle to the clinic as shes bringing back bad memories.. So she cancels with her. Danielle tells stacey this week and stacey says to danielle what happens if she still doesnt want you. So it looks like its not soon.

I7VWXlCUaa	You have to keep trying. DO NOT give up. Persevere & eventually, you will. But most importantly, you have to have talent.|`|UAHjJpC0aa	It's not easy    the biggest part, is that you have to actually have talent    which, if you watch American Mydol, isn't as simple as most people think    there are thousands and THOUSANDS of people out there, that "want to be famous",  but just aren't that good,    You need a lot of experience,  so that you can "own the stage".    most artists that have gotten "signed" have YEARS of experience, practicing, getting lessons.  (a real teacher will be objective, family and friends will all say your good, whether you are good or not)    performing in a group,   on stages,  touring, (or moving to a large music mecca like LA, NY, Nashville, Memphis, Austin etc, you have to be SEEN, to be "discovered")    talent contests  open mics  jam sessions etc    get as much REAL stage experience as you can,  so you can hone your chops,   sing in front of a live audience    and again.....    talent, Talent, TALENT    there aren't any short cuts    good luck|`|3LIzti5maa	play live as often as you can in as many places as you can  send demos everywhere  if you get any kind of response from a label, keep sending them your new stuff  if this doesnt work your either unlucky or really bad|`|KV9VqkAoaa	OMGGG!!

6GdeuiCgaa	Robotech?|`|FMqEkEAqaa	Mazinger Z, or Mezinger Z|`|68yc6XMzaa	The original television series (1984)  Main article: Robotech (TV series)  Robotech was one of the first series released in the United States which attempted to include most of the complexity and drama of its original Japanese source material. Produced by Harmony Gold USA, Inc. in association with Tatsunoko Prod. Co., Ltd., Robotech is a story adapted with edited content and revised dialogue from the animation of three different mecha anime series: The Super Dimension Fortress Macross, Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross, and Genesis Climber Mospeada. Harmony Gold's cited reasoning for combining these unrelated series was its decision to market Macross for American weekday syndication television, which required a minimum of 65 episodes at the time (thirteen weeks at five episodes per week). Macross and the two other series each had fewer episodes than required, since they originally aired in Japan as weekly series.    This combination resulted in a storyline that spans three generations, as mankind must fight three destructive Robotech Wars in succession over a powerful energy source and "lifeblood" of two different races called "Protoculture":    The First Robotech War (The Macross Saga) concerns humanity's battle against the Zentraedi, a race of giant warriors who are sent to earth to retrieve the flagship of the Robotech Master Zor. The ship contains the last known source of Protoculture in the universe.   The Second Robotech War (The Masters) begins when the creators of the Zentraedi, the Robotech Masters, attempt to take up where the Zentraedi left off, and capture the protoculture held within the remains of the SDF-1.   The Third Robotech War (The New Generation) occurs after the alien Invid have been alerted to the existence of Protoculture on Earth by events that transpired at the end of the Second Robotech War. The planet is conquered, then enslaved, and it is up to the Robotech Expeditionary Force (and the Earth rebels) to retake their ancestral homeland.   On some television stations, the syndicated run was preceded by the broadcast premiere of Codename: Robotech, a feature-length pilot.|`|AA11111233	I think you're talking about Pole Position.  Bionic Six also comes to mind, but I doubt that's correct.|`|AA10289523	Robotech is a science fiction franchise that was launched by an 85-episode adaptation of three different anime television series. Within the combined and edited story, Robotechnology refers to the scientific advances discovered in an alien starship that crashed on a South Pacific island. With this technology, Earth developed giant robotic machines or mecha (many of which were capable of transforming into vehicles) to fight three successive extraterrestrial invasions.[1]

NGNeT3rYaa	It is starting to look inapproopriate. But like you said this stuff does happen but gee, hasnt Starr had enough drama!  In other OLTL news:  Clint Ritchie, who played ONE LIFE TO LIVE's Clint Buchanan from 1979 to 1998 (with several visits, his last in 2004), died on Jan. 31 at the age of 70. Ritchie died of a heart attack according to RadarOnLine.com.|`|rFZtQuV2aa	If Starr turns to Schuyler for friendship - that's okay.  Nothing inappropriate about it.  It's good to have a teacher as a friend.  I think it's likely they do become a couple and that could get touchy.  Times have changed so much since the olden days - and yes, this is what happens in real life.|`|97158e12e6c17080ec04a0a2b2456b2aaa	yea, there is definatly something more than a teacher student relationship between them, but i wish Starr was at the legal age because, i think they would actually be a good couple together, but i know some ppl will think its gross.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I agree, Starr is starting to get in over her head.|`|5e078b550b17c8d663fd621560c00169aa	Their relationship so far is fine, I've known many students to turn to teachers for comfort when their personal life is totally messed up.     But this being a soap opera, everything that happens is leading to something and they wouldnt bring in a cute, young teacher for no reason, so ofcourse there is going to be some sort of a intimate relationship developed between the two. Luckily starr is a senior, so hopefully shell be 18 when it happens.|`|bxH8zngPaa	I think that Starr and Schuyler will become a couple later on down the road after she graduates high school this year and becomes 18.  They are actually cute together!|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I think that they both just so desperately need a friend now who understands what they're going through. He is trying very hard to maintain a sense of propriety, but he also understands how much she needs his friendship and advice. I just hope that the writers don't ruin it and take the obvious route.|`|AA12336927	who said anything was going on with them? AT this point I think that its just  the common bond between 2 people that have had such a heavy load dumped their way. They found through talking they have that connection because of his mother and her father.   Thats not to say that this may become way more than that. In real life when things like this happens, it does seem to draw two people together.   NOW, on the other hand, the supreme court ( in real life) has just made a ruling on this very thing. If something happens between a teacher and student, as long as the student is over 18, its okay. So maybe that is the point they are trying to bring up.

1cmPcgcoaa	They just decided to spell prospect in an eye catching way....worked on you, didn't it.|`|A7QUjI8eaa	I think they are misspelling the work prospect on on purpose and this is the definition:    prospect    The potential things that may come to pass, often favorable.   1788, James Hutton, Theory of the earth, page 166:     The result, therefore, of this physical inquiry is, that we find no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end.     But, it also means "brochure" in German.

Rachel takes forever to get ready and gets mad when Ross yells at her. Phoebe spills something on her dress, and Chandler and Joey are fighting over sitting the comfy chair. Joey gets up from the chair and takes the cushion with him, so that is why Chandler hides his clothes. If I am not mistaken this is the episode, you are thinking of.

w1FOvD9Faa	You can make videos of the band and then promote them on YouTube - good way to get people who might like the music interested. Perhaps the band could record a cover of a very popular song, and then people searching for the original would come across the cover and might be inclined to click and listen.     Is there a local town paper, or even a local college or school newspaper, who might be interested in writing a review of the band's CD or a gig? Send free invites to shows or free copies of the CD out to the editors, or give them a phonecall offering either to see if they're interested, and see if you can get the band some page-space that way. Word would then get around and notoriety would spread.    Send copies of the CD to editors of music magazines - it's a long shot, but you'd be surprised how many bands have been discovered that way. You could also look into having your friends' band open a show for another local band on the scene, who are better known - thus any publicity given to the other band would also include your friends' band.|`|udasUkwEaa	Try Them getting into a summer festival and asking to play their track on radio. p.s summer festivals hire now|`|eDK4mpf9aa	myspace and or youtube

JReroESmaa	no they're both in 3D :)<br>   this is what imax means : <br>  <br>  IMAX (short for Image MAXimum) is a film format created by Canada's IMAX Corporation that has the capacity to display images of far greater size and resolution than conventional film display systems. A standard IMAX screen is 22 metres (72 ft) wide and 16.1 metres (53 ft) high, but can be larger. As of 2008, IMAX is the most widely used system for large-format, special-venue film presentations. As of March 2007, there were 280 IMAX theatres in 38 countries (60% of these are located in Canada and the United States). Half of these are commercial theatres and half are in educational venues.|`|JhvYXbMmaa	They're both 3D, but the one on the IMAX theater would be bigger on a bigger screen. It depends on the theater though, because I went to see an IMAX Harry Potter in a Museum and it was AMAZING, like I was in the movie. But I saw an IMAX movie in a regular movie theater and I didn't even see the difference.

TmIxJNagaa	Well it depends if it has a trem i would say no because emg's tend to pick up the spring vibrations. But if it's a non-trem you would have to carve out a section of the body to make space for the battery which would cost a lot of money.If you have the money and want to do it then go for it. But i would recommend saving up and buying a guitar that has emg's built in.

KJuOlp73aa	I must point out one misconception first: the 1982 version of "Blade Runner" is the domestic one, with voice over narration spoken by Harrison Ford, and the tacked on happy ending, known as ride into the sunset. The Director's Cut came out in 1992, and removes both the voice over and that ending. <br>   Concerning the cultural significance of the film, here goes: <br>  A) It predicts with foreboding accuracy climate change, that would become more serious over the years. You have extreme pollution in mega-cities (Los Angeles in 2019), with huge industrial complexes in its midst (the opening shot of the movie, with that marvelous 'Hades' landscape). That causes rain to pour down almost continually throughout the film.<br>  B) The decline of social structures, with the streets overcrowded mostly with poor and homeless people, while the super-rich and other elites live above in enormous and sophisticated buildings and sky-scrappers (hence Dr. Tyrell and where he lives).<br>  C) When the film came out one could only dream about the subject, but the whole issue of the replicants clearly has to do with genetic engineering, and the problematic ethics involved. They're basically clones of humans being fabricated in laboratories, and are made to basically be slaves for hazardous and hard labour and to engage in combat in off-world colonies.<br>  D) Asian influence in commercial and marketing venues in the city, namely Japanese, do mirror their dominating influence in the state of the art computer and technical industries, and also the auto industry, that would come into effect in the years to come. <br>   Those were some of the aspects that lead to the people and critics alike to say that this film is visionary, and prescient as it predicted many things that came to pass. The urban future predicted there is 'now' in several places in the world, such as metropolitan centers in Hong Kong, Japan and even the United States (think of Times Square in New York, with all its neon signs and special advertisements in buildings and the like).|`|ScZPVCUpaa	The continual rain in LA indicates climate change<br>  The erosion of the infrastructure is indicative of  cultural decline<br>  The hatred of robots is a form of racism<br>  The rise of Asian influence reflects the rise of their dominance in the auto, and technical industries in the present day|`|4THwFGjUaa	I significantly do not know why.<br>  <br>  I like the movie.|`|S3sB1LA7aa	It represents several cultural trends from the 70's/80s and extrapolates them into the late 2010's<br>  <br>  (1) It shows basic animal species being made extinct.  The snake that Zhora uses in her dance is artificial, and she states that that should be obvious.<br>  <br>  (2) It shows a powerful Photoshop-like application on a personal computer, with voice recognition and photo printouts, years before such an application existed for the masses.<br>  <br>  (3) It presents a crowded, dirty Earth that people would want to leave, hence, the "Off World" advertisements.<br>  <br>  (4) It presents telephone calls at inflated prices- a 30-second local video call costs $1.25.  In the 70's/80's, a local call usually cost a dime.

I was acctually about to buy this guitar: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.guitarcenter.com/Paul-Reed-Smith-SE-Single-Cut-Electric-Guitar-104225099-i1150580.gc" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitarcenter.com/Paul-Reed-Sm...</a><br>  <br>  until i stumbled upon a gibson les paul for about the same price. (the gibson is more expensive now) here it is in case ur curious <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.guitarcenter.com/Gibson-Les-Paul-Vintage-Mahogany-Electric-Guitar-102771409-i1169816.gc" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitarcenter.com/Gibson-Les-P...</a><br>  <br>  They were both great to play and i actually got to try out that prs at guitar center and it was very nice and easy to play. These types of guitars will give you more sustain and a more thick or chunky sound. <br>  <br>  As for amps, line 6 is a good, affordable amp. the spider 3 series is good i personally have a spider 3 30 watts (simply because i dont need any more power than that). here is the link to all of the spider amps:<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.guitarcenter.com/Search/Default.aspx?src=spider+III&Search.x=0&Search.y=0&Search=Go" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitarcenter.com/Search/Defau...</a><br>  <br>  u should look at either the 15, 30, or 75 watt amp. <br>  <br>  And if ur looking for quality do not get a starter package, get ur stuff separately. Have fun, and remember to try ur equipment at the store before buying.|`|foKxdNeTaa	why not just get a gibson epiphone copy...they're a pretty good guitar..|`|rRCTvT7Saa	For electrics, I can only recommend these:  Fender Strats, Fender Teles and West Virginia's best-kept secret, Crook Custom Guitars (crookcustomguitars.com).  And, yes--all of those are great for rock, metal, blues, surf rock and jazz whereas the Teles and Crooks are also great for country!|`|XaunUuEdaa	i would say a stratocaster, they're petty good, they sound good whit any music style, and if you're looking for a nice sound, that's definitly the one. The les pauls have this distortion that may be good or not, you can perfectly listen to it in GNR songs, that's why kids that have other kinds of guitarrs try and try to get the sweet child o mine tune, but they can't.<br>  <br>  I'm sure that a Fander will be exelent, besides they're not expensive, they have really cool desings, and sound good.<br>  <br>  I have a Fender and sounds awesome, I use it to play punk music more than anything and it's pretty freaking awesome.|`|M9R6VAlKaa	I'd go with an Ibanez if I were you, they look great and I've heard some with great clean/overdrive/distortion sound in the ~$500 price range (not really that expensive if you really intend to get good, believe it's worth it to spend a bit more to get a better guitar). I'm more of a Fender person myself, but I don't play too much metal, and of the other brands I've played I'd have to go with Ibanez or Gibson for what you're looking for (and to be honest with Gibson, what you're paying for a lot of the time is the name, don't get me wrong, they're great guitars though). I hope whatever you get serves you well :).|`|5g0zCTqMaa	the only way to know is to go and try it out if there is a guitar center near you they'll let you try the guitar and amp out right there in the store so yea thats what i'd do.|`|SkRJNhuCaa	There is no "best".<br>  B.C. Rich certainly isn't it, they're strictly one-trick horses that are designed purely for shred metal and nothing else.<br>  <br>  The best (in fact only) way to decide what you should get is to play and play a lot of different instruments.<br>  That's why stores carry so many and have amps set up near the guitars, practice rooms as well.<br>  What works for someone will not work for someone else. If that weren't the case and there were a single "best" instrument, that would be the only one on the market by now.<br>  <br>  Fenders are good quality, so are Ibanez'sm so are Gibsons (but indeed they're more expensive).<br>  But there are many others, and without playing them to feel them, hear them (rather than listening to some cleaned, processed sample tracks on a website), see them for real (rather than a computer generated picture on a website) you'll never know which is "best" for you for now.

That guy was a beast.|`|SKFIjyoVaa	Drago would dominate, clubber was known for his powerful punches, but with a combination of steriods and technology, Drago became superhuman. Clubber also had a weakness for speed which contributed to his downfall (along with his rage) whereas Drago was calm and collected throughout most of the fight and had speed on his side as well. Also, Drago killed a guy<br>  And last but not least, Rocky ended up with brain damage from his only fight with Drago but suffered no mental/long term injury from either of his fights with Clubber<br>  <br>  hope this helps

KTg4Gl1faa	The character of Harvey Dent/Two Face as portrayed in the movie and the comics lives by one rule, the flip of a coin.  Two face will only kill if the coin says to do it.  In the scene you are referring to Harvey says to the Joker something like heads you live, scarred face of the coin you die and then he flips it.  So the flip came out that he lived.  You also see in the following Two Face scenes that he always flips the coin to see if a person lives or dies.<br>  <br>  Joker's plan is to destroy the "white knight".  To show that under the right circumstances even a hero can become a villian.|`|IARPr7k5aa	i think because at that point, harvey just couldn't take being the good guy anymore because it just wasn't the way to justice anymore in gotham city. so he probably went to the dark side at that point and why make the joker his enemy when he is now at odds with batman the same as joker. see, this way it's 2 bad guys against the one. because of batman and the other cops following protocol, he lost it love.|`|dHF0l6bLaa	he felt that gotham didnt save him when he saved them and when he ad the option of killling the joker he didnt cause he felt like gotham needed to pay and he acted out of anger and emotion for his GF passing away.<br>  <br>  it was really the turning point of the movie cause its where gothams white night is destroyed and the dark night "batman" has to do what is right even if it is within the realms of wrong|`|Z1HLUP6daa	Harvey wanted it to be fair, so he flipped his double headed coin, which was burned on one side from the fire. The charred side, the Joker dies, the head, he lives. It's all about fairness and equality.|`|NmG1FFSRaa	because hes 2 faced, he has the side that wanted to, but the kind side is still there

AA10246871	Yes. I have before.<br>  <br>  The most memorable time was when a few girlfriends and I rented tuxedos to go to a formal dance. I was the only one with a boyfriend at the time, and he and I were fighting, and I told him to take the tickets and stuff them, so he gave them to his brother. After that, one of my friends said that she really, really wanted to go to the dance because there were going to be some crashers from another school, and she liked one of them a lot. She didn't want to actually ask him to the dance, however, because she was shy. She just wanted to be there, because he was going to be there with a bunch of friends. After trying on dresses for a long time, and not finding anything any of us liked (we all wanted to sort of match, and we all have different body shapes, so the same types of dresses didn't look good on all of us), someone finally said, "You know, we should just go as boys." So that's what we did. I had a bit of a problem with my vest, since I am very busty, but they tailored it for me and it worked out great. The only item of men's clothing we didn't wear was shoes--we wore heels and stockings. It was pretty fun.<br>  <br>  All the girls hated us--all our male friends wanted to dance with us because of the novelty of dancing with a woman in a tux. We got a lot of dirty looks for a few weeks after that.<br>  <br>  It wasn't really that much of a stretch for me, since I have always been a tomboy, and have always worn a lot of men's clothes.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd wear a dress. Buy some fairly inexpensive low-heeled shoes. Don't wear flats, because that's chickening out, but don't go for a big heel, either, or you're liable to break your neck. Most stores which sell women's shoes have really good discount prices on the really large sizes because not many women wear them--you should be able to pick up a shoe you can wear if you look around a bit (unless you wear a size 11 or larger--that's a women's 12 1/2, and is hard to find--you might have to resort to eBay).<br>  <br>  Have a great time!<br>  <br>  Oh, one more tip--shave your legs before you put on stockings or pantyhose--they're almost impossible to get on if you don't. I live where it's cold, and when I was in high school, some of the football players imitated Joe Namath and wore pantyhose under their uniforms for warmth. I was told by several that it's hard to put on hose if your legs are hairy.|`|ij9N9r5waa	Yes friends and I have done this many times, it's always a riot.

6dAsdiA5aa	You mean, Ben 10?<br>  <br>  Ben Tennyson, his cousin Gwen, and their grandfather Max, during the start of their summer camping trip, Ben goes stomping off into the woods after another fight with Gwen, whom he is not happy to have along on the trip, and finds an alien pod on the ground. When he examines it, he finds a mysterious, watch-like device, called the Omnitrix, stored inside. The device attaches permanently to his wrist and gives him the ability to transform into a variety of alien life-forms, each with their own unique powers, quite similar to DC's Dial H for Hero comic. Although Ben realizes that he has a responsibility to help others with these new abilities at his disposal, he is not above a little superpowered mischief now and then. Along with Gwen and Max, Ben fights evil, both extraterrestrial and criminal.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_10" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_10</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/ben%2010/bentennyson_01/benandthe10aliens.jpg?o=5" rel="nofollow">http://media.photobucket.com/image/ben%2...</a>|`|zNPGaZRHaa	shin chan<br>  xavier renegade angel<br>  cromartie highschool<br>  green green tv<br>  FLCL (fooly cooly)|`|LSn5iF47aa	FLCL (only one i remember with 6 epis only)<br>  <a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/227/Furi_Kuri" rel="nofollow">http://myanimelist.net/anime/227/Furi_Ku...</a>|`|0kseszAKaa	Try www.manga.com and look for it if u want a manga version of it but other than that i have no idea what ur talkin bout . ps .

Very very shy dude in fact. Sometimes when he is feeling extra shy he will sometimes turn and sing with his back toward the crowed. <br>  <br>  Same goes for Buckethead (Brian) that's why he wares that ridicules mask and KFC bucket on his head he feels more secure that no one sees his Identity. Brian is also very very shy.<br>  <br>  I would say the best stage presence I have seen from a band would be Mr. Bungle but like way back in the day. They had insane stage presence like even more crazy than Iggy Pop. they kind of calmed down over the years but their stage presence on their first 2 big time tours was insane.<br>  <br>  Same goes for Dillinger Escape Plan. Mass energy from those guys they are insane I am surprised they haven't killed one another or take one of their band members heads off as they swing their guitars around any which way it goes|`|Hkoc8A4Jaa	Lamb of God!

17281684a8c9fb76859999f1be18c50aaa	Warning: There's a lot of Music Theory up ahead.<br>  <br>  A chord is a combination of three notes within a scale. The scale determines which chords will be Major and which will be minor, depending on the notes used. The easiest key to start learning this with is the key of C, since there are no sharps or flats. So the notes in the key of C (and a C scale) are:<br>  <br>  1 (or Root): C<br>  2 : D<br>  3: E<br>  4: F<br>  5: G<br>  6: A<br>  7: B<br>  8 (or Octave): C<br>  <br>  Notice that the 1st note and the 8th note are the same.<br>  <br>  It's important to learn the spacing between the notes, which is why C is the easiest key to start with. Notice that when we went from Note 1 to Note 2, or C to D, we skipped a note: C#. The space between Note 1 and Note 2 is a whole step. We did the same thing between Note 2 and Note 3 -- we skipped D# and went straight to E. However, there's no E#, so when we went to F, we only went up a half-step.<br>  <br>  So the spacing would be Whole, Whole, Half, Whole, Whole, Whole, Half. Learning that pattern will help you figure out the scales for other keys (like D Major, G Major, A Major, etc).<br>  <br>  This spacing helps you learn which chords are Major and which are minor. The Major and minor chords are usually as follows, with the Roman Numerals being the number of the Chord:<br>  <br>  I = Major<br>  ii = minor<br>  iii = minor<br>  IV = Major<br>  V = Major<br>  vi = minor<br>  vii = diminished (a very nasty chord that isn't used much in modern music)<br>  VIII = I = Major<br>  <br>  So, with the example you gave (the notes C G G A A G) the chords would look like this:<br>  <br>  C major (or "C")<br>  G major (or "G")<br>  G<br>  A minor (or "Am")<br>  Am<br>  G|`|SqE8dFGQaa	A chord is usually three or more notes from the same scale (usuall the first, the thrid and the fifth) played all at once. They are used in all intruments, but you need to have more than one person playing at a time if it is a wind instrument, which can only play one note at a time.<br>  As for the piano, it's unclear what you mean, but i'd say you play the corresponding chord for each note if they were to be treated as a chord.|`|duS5ozbQaa	STRUM the guitar, don't pluck it.

It's stupid as well. If you think about it, you just live and then you die. One moment you can be so alive and observe everything everywhere, do whatever you wish, believe, dream, hope, and the very next day, you can become ill and sick in bed, and your health is down the drain. It's funny how people are so greedy and selfish and self centered sometimes. People forget their manners, people can actually do the stupidest things like skipping people waiting in the bathroom lines! yeah, that happened to me about 3 weeks ago. I just find that so funny. Sometimes, i just hate people. It's like a game, you try to be nice? Noone remembers! But what you do wrong, people remember that forever and use that against you. Life is like a journey, an experience of how pointless it is at times, you never know what you'll face next, it's like people are controlling others, it's all an illusion, its like a stage, everyone's acting...I try to be optimistic, but at times, there's nothing really to be happy about, people are always complaining about every single little thing not being perfect, when I'm pretty sure there are 100000000000000 people out there who have it 10000000000000 x worse. <br>  <br>  whew.

He didn't mean to kill him , just scare him into revealing where Kate was. But then the earthquake hit and he died underground!|`|ADBMrG87aa	Yes, it was revealed that Tad Martin had killed him.  Tad had placed Greg in a coffin and buried him alive to scare the crap out of him so he'd tell Tad everything he wanted to know regarding the location of Tad's child but it all went awry when the a rainstorm came and the coffin collapsed and Greg died before he could be dug up.|`|AA11202477	Yes, Tad Martin was torturing Dr. McMad[den] to get him to tell where Kate was; unfortunately there was an earthquake in PV which caused the coffin Dr. Nutso was in to malfunction and he was buried alive.|`|GrE1UM2Saa	tad was the person they suspected tad and dixie but it was only tad in the end|`|fQLeIAh1aa	it was a prank gone wrong... he was supposed to betortured but then he was burried by the earth quake.|`|WjuSuKjoaa	Tad is the one who put Greg in the coffin and buried him alive as a way of scaring him into telling where Kate was.  There ended up being a rain storm, and by the time Tad got to the grave, Josh and the police were already there trying to dig him out.  Tad actually had nightmares for a little while about being guilty of his death, and killing what he thought was his last chance to find his daughter, but got over them fairly quickly!|`|l3k21kTmaa	Tad Martin

pHteEAF8aa	No. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  That's my official answer.|`|QvSwo3X9aa	Anything that affects your body's function is a drug. People don't want to think of marijuana as a drug because they think of it as "natural" but lots of other drugs come from plants like cocaine, heroin and tobacco.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	In my mind drugs are manufactured. That would mean weed is not a drug. I would refer to it technically as dope.|`|6bxOT9qJaa	Depends if they get you high or not! :-)|`|DcUoZntOaa	not in my opinion.<br>  peace!|`|iizKx4Bvaa	hehehe no.|`|mwv79AIhaa	nope, its a naturally grown plant of the earth..period, answered.|`|rzZXJz0qaa	I agree w David M. hehe .. No... =)|`|yas23v7laa	weed should not be called a drug! it helps with depression and with cancer. have you ever seen the movie Super High Me? well in this movie a celebrity quits smoking pot for 30 day, while he is off the pot he does some test and gets some pretty high scores, after the 30 day down period he starts smoking for 30 days all day everyday, he smokes pot like it were a cigg. well any way after smoking for 30 days he takes the same test and get an even higher score, so weed does not always make you stupid. when i was in high school i would never go to school unless i was high! it made me concentrate more. i payed greater  attention to everything, and i was also able to stay focused on lectures. and pot is also not addictive. there is nothing in it that makes you NEED it, you can get a head addiction but not very many ppl get that. i have been smoking for 8 years and im not addicted and i graduated with honors, i havent smoked in 4 days and im fine,<br>  <br>  so in my eyes NO weed is not a drug, it should be leagalized and their should be no age at which you can start smoking. <br>  <br>  pot is amazing and if anyone tells you otherwise tell them  to shut up because the have obviously never smoked it.|`|0wBIlxdraa	Yes, May Jane, there is a well known weed that is a drug.  But then you already knew that, didn't you?|`|lq1gXmzyaa	absolutely not|`|zFwjZy53aa	No they are plants that make life a hell of a lot better|`|jRRTdT4uaa	its weed and yes it is, but there are way worse drugs out there|`|EsufC1qhaa	no... but it depends what people mean by weed.  it could be sea-weed or the drug weed itself.|`|FZz11XB4aa	only if they make you feel good.|`|mggll8dRaa	Both are worthless to good mental health....!!|`|c3MFIbeUaa	Don't know about weeds in general as some flower make up great drugs used for medical purposes and a weed  or flower is strictly in the eyes of the beholder. Such as  dandelions make up some great wines and most people consider them weeds.<br>   If your referring to Marijuana and i am sure you are I think yes it can be considered as a drug in some cases as it does alleviate pain and it has been used for medical purposes.<br>   Whether the drug should be regulated is entirely a different question as alcohol is also used as a drug but it is allowed a certain freedom of not having the regulation of other drugs. Right or wrong. The government must first realize that it is more profitable and less costly to decriminalize it then to fill jail cells with the users of this particular herb or drug.|`|M7W7lZBBaa	They are a mind altering PLANT<br>  <br>  For it to be a drug it would first have to be altered with a chemical substance, therefore weed is in fact not a drug.<br>  <br>  I honestly will never completely understand why it is illegal as it is a naturally grown plant. If you ask me, beer/alcohol is by far a worse substance.|`|6y5wgdmHaa	WHICH WEEDS?  There are thousands of different kinds of "weeds".  <br>  Be specific.  Even the slang term is "weed", not "weeds".<br>  <br>  ~~THE PLANT LADY`~~<br>  <br>  Are peyote, pscilocibin mushrooms, and nightshade weeds?<br>  Or religious herbs?  Or herbs used for healing/medicinal purposes?<br>  <br>  Also - are you asking if pot is a bad drug or a medicinal drug {glaucoma, arthritis, migraines, severe pain}?|`|8ZUVToXgaa	Weed is a drug. Not the worst out there, but it's still a drug. And it's WEED not WEEDs with an "S".|`|90877616d47129b0c2c87f6d63b53f65aa	yes cause whether in the ground or smoked up it destroys good things

6qDhXpWfaa	Yeah I completely understand where you're coming from. For the longest time people used the rationalization that black people are like animals and most closely related to apes and monkeys so they can be treated like animals too, therefore, using them as slaves. That's BS. Obviously. <br>  <br>  I realize the comic can be interpreted like that, but then again, you never know, the artist might have just wanted to call Obama incompetent by calling him a monkey and didn't mean to be racist.|`|rNxK7cY8aa	I agree with Sinbow33. It happens all the time. People don't get angry like this when they do this type of thing to white people.<br>  So why is it always about black people? Thats pretty racist in itself if you ask me...<br>  No one gets this p****d off about a jew joke after all....<br>  <.<|`|K68EpBAlaa	Definitely! That is so low and ridiculous! The world is crazy! After everything African Americans have been through white people or whoever do THIS!!?? UGH! This type of thing makes me SO mad!!!!!|`|fl2WrZnfaa	yeah it is, it pictures an assassination of a someone like a black person. no offense, am I being racial? sorry|`|N4xd99Qaaa	I thought calling the writer of the stimulus bill a monkey pretty darn funny. Politcians often get represented as animals in political cartoons. I don't see how this has anything to do with race since the man and the chimp are two different species. I suppose if I were a racist I could see this as racial propaganda but then I would be such a bigot I would be asking why is 'the black president' forced to live in 'the white house'.|`|xJWZTwFVaa	Dont mean to offend anyone, but brilliant!!!!! its so good to see some jokes that aren't pc! how can't anyone see the funny side??????<br>  by the way i support Obama even though i live in the UK!|`|rn5xImvTaa	racist and not very clever

When this seal is not tight, stomach acid creeps up your esophagus and you feel heartburn. There is a way to "stop" it. your stomach is curved a certain way and if you lay on one side (sorry i dont remember which side) it will keep the acid in the stomach so it doesnt move up your esophagus.|`|wFN8bVqsaa	Acidic foods like orange juice, tomatoes, tomato sauce.

7RUqEJzLaa	The Face and body will attract you first, but the personality will go further in the relationship. The personality will be the reason you stay. If they have a bad personality then you usually don't date them. Why date a really hot guy when he is super mean to you when you can date a not so hot guy but who is super nice and sweet? At first glance, you would usually say the hot guy, but once you get to know them you will be more attracted to the other guy.|`|twVyisGnaa	Personality.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|mMi19s7Vaa	Im not going to lie body<br>  he must have a smokin hott body lol =]|`|26eb811a3389534c3b02e6e2bb665965aa	Personality|`|gUdlaaGwaa	Personality.|`|Rr1bh2P1aa	personality : )|`|eiEdUWNbaa	A nice body will always turn my head.|`|tlUihEOvaa	Personality matters most in the end and in the long run. <br>  <br>  Of course what attracts me to someone is their looks first but if they have a terrible personality then I'd be turn off and see them as unattractive even if they are physically attractive.|`|JBv7pwrHaa	Face is usually the first one I notice.<br>  <br>  Then after I get to know them better, personality.<br>  <br>  Body doesn't really matter to me.|`|n5u3rkV4aa	personality. <br>  =D<br>  <br>  (though when you see someone at first without getting to know them you are most influenced by their face)<<i know i know...i dont know the meaning of "PICK ONLY ONE" =D|`|3533878a4dd2e1fbf5bf9526167668dbaa	Personality.|`|9uZAluGhaa	personality|`|RsXOS3aqaa	what attracts me more is personality

e55d4a01420a2827c4108baf10b7d77daa	According to Emporis, it's 12 floors or more, but the concept is entirely subjective, since in the olden days, a building over four stories was considered a skyscraper. But me, I don't use floors alone to determine if a building is a skyscraper, I also factor in how many floors it has. For example, this eight story apartment building my one uncle lives in downtown is not a skyscraper, but the six story building across the street from it is, because all of the floors above the normal-for-an-office-building first and second floor are equal to two floors high (while I think the third and sixth floors are even taller than the fourth and fifth). That six story building is as tall as a standard 11 or 12 story building.<br>  <br>  It's even more subjective because it depends on the people you talk to. Talk to someone in New York City and they'll say it has to be at least 500 feet tall or something like that, but talk to someone in rural Pennsylvania (I mean a place that most Pennsyltucky folks call the boonies), and they might call a typical three story building a skyscraper.|`|0q3JRHVzaa	skyscrapers don;t have to be a certain number of floors, they just have to be higher than the surrounding buildings they are built next to, so they stand out.

I think if she knew you could smell her feet should wouldn't take off her shoes in the first place. <br>  Secondly, yes I do the same everytime I wear heels in class. After walking around and working all day I can't wait to get those heels off. Then that brings up another question... If heels are so aggravating, why wear them in the first place? Because they match my outfits. :-)|`|836vtf9Saa	This is a wierd question dude....|`|scyLaz0saa	I always take off my heels and play with them. lol But I do not think she knows that you can smell her feet.

RvddYKqjaa	Many people have various fetishes, and the foot fetish is quite common. I would say it is normal, and it doesn't hurt anyone. If you are asking, perhaps you feel it's not normal. Just don't talk about it a lot, and no one will know, if you don't want them too. I'm not intending to make light jokes about something that is serious for you, but I almost wish my husband had a foot fetish, so he would massage my feet for me. Oh, he would do that, but it's nice to think about it on a regular basis!  Hope the females in your life enjoy it.|`|FDt7cC8haa	I seen in your avatar...you are touching yourself....no surprise there.....|`|tFGMfDthaa	I think it's called a foot fetish.

ycbkzprjaa	There are more sayings about Time. Time is the greatest teacher, unfortunately, it kills all its pupils. Time heals all wounds is partially true in life in that as time goes on, so does one's memory of good and bad events. Speaking of the deceased, they no longer feel pain (or anything for that matter).

Leda2ha0aa	It was a good first part of a two part finale.  Jeff, Leah and Jamie were all brought back and whoever won the quick fire challenge would be able to compete to go to the finals.  Jeff ended up being the clear winner (picked by Emeril - they were in New Orleans).<br>  <br>  When the final chefs competed in the next challenge, Jeff had to win first place or he would go home.  He ended up being in the top 3 with Carla and Hosea but Carla was picked the best.  She was completely shocked.  She struggled to open 100 oysters for her dish, when all she had to do was steam them and the shells would have fallen right off.  She also won a new cross-over vehicle (very nice).  Jeff had to say good-bye since he didn't come in first.<br>  <br>  Stefan and Fabio were in the bottom 2.  Stefan was confronted about being cocky and too sure of himself by Tom Collichio.  It was Fabio who was going home instead because he mixed his Italian in with the Creole.  I was sad to see him go, and he said that Stefan would go all the way to the top without a doubt.  We shall see next week!|`|grPckwSsaa	carla won<br>  <br>  fabio is gone!<br>  <br>  jeff, jamie, and leah came back... they did a quick fire... jeff won so he was able to compete. the only way he was allowed back in the competition is if he won the challenge, he didnt win|`|otYIidtHaa	Looks like you already got some pretty good answers. i am sad about Fabio, but if you need a re-cap in the future, check out www.televisionwithoutpity.com it is AWESOME and hilarious!

zFQi5U5Naa	your not the only one. I remember a time not too long ago when you can actually turn on mtv and actually watch a video. Also the songs were so much better back then you can relate to the lyrics . How can you relate to them today, at least they didn't have girls in a g string and high heels dancing in the videos . The girls were sexy but not over the top it is really sad to see what the music has come to and anyone who says that miley cyrus demi lavato and the jonas brothers can sing you better get your ears checked.

We are in the age of recycling and every time I tune in there is a "new" song with a rhythm from another artist.  example Rhianna's shut up and drive is really "Blue Monday".  Apparently no one but me seems to notice.  Originality is a thing of the past and since people like to have everything given to them, the "artists" have fallen suit.  Let me ask you a question..When was the last time Kid Rock had an original hit?|`|0AlqZNC2aa	you've got to really hunt around to find the good stuff, the popular music that you hear on, say, kiss FM or Z97 or whatever SUCKS. but there's still good stuff out there, you've just got to know where to find it. and there's always the oldies that you can resort to when all else fails cough *BEATLES* cough. even though most of the popular music sucks, music is still the only thing that truly makes sense.|`|pR0pJNJkaa	There is a lot of good music out there but much of it is poorly marketed. The other side of it is consumers are buy all this ring tone, radio, garbage. So if music sucks it's our faults. But I can't deny the artistry of some people today. I love what Alicia Keys is doing. I love what Nas did this year.|`|8i76USBBaa	awesomness.<br>  <br>  your listening to the wrong stuff, there's still good music being made out there. Just don't listen to the top 10.|`|8qlvJeBFaa	not all of it is bad! everybody has their own opinion.

tLI94qWNaa	A tale of two sisters is an amazing movie, and it is just so mind blowing.  It is way better then the uninvited.  The subtitles are not annoying at all, if you cant appreciate the movie being in another language then you shouldn't watch it.  It is worth it though and easy to follow.  You have to watch it more then once, because it is a hard story to follow in general, not because it is in another language but just because the story is so complex.

I don't know i fyou've listened hard enough, but there's more than one voice there.<br>  <br>  ps- she's already gone solo.|`|TqtzzsHjaa	The other couple of girls in the band get to sing like a couple of words a song, otherwise, no she sings it all, making them totally pointless.|`|WMbmCg3waa	I've thought this myself, but I think part of the reason they sell so well is because they're supposed to be good looking and good dancers so together they can all put on an entertaining show with lots of catchy dance routines. I think they're more like dancers that are actually part of the group. I don't know if this is supposed to make them more 'original' or something...<br>  <br>  I don't know if you can tell, but I really don't like them =P|`|QP975trWaa	Truee!|`|GSYW5YMuaa	back up singers!

6U9b2t4raa	I gotta go with Jay-Jay with the Vegas thing. It has everything we look for:  booze, gambling, strip clubs, escorts, cheap buffets, quickie marriage chapels,hookers, and Elvis.   Something for everybody.|`|LDv4dqLraa	Hi Maggie, it would be great to say we could all meet in an exotic place like Bora Bora (and that would be nice) but would it really matter if we are all together just having a good time at a pub anywhere.<br>  <br>  I vote for 'anywhere' where we meet up and have a few drinks and enjoy ourselves.|`|rPywKtJRaa	Can we say warmth?  Texas invasion?  The big apple?  Atlantic city is like a smaller vegas.  I am really not all that particular can I pick you up on the way and be your travel buddy?  That is my only request. Either that or travel with CMP.  (That would be like a lefty, HoJ experience hehe)|`|WT9cjXtIaa	I've never been to Chicago or Texas, so that would be fun. But I think Scoundrel is exactly right. It would have to be somewhere exotic and very warm. Maybe Brazil.|`|RluCMVUSaa	I would be okay with just about anywhere.  My first choice honestly would be to go to the UK though, I haven't been and it would be awesome to go and even better to go and meet your contacts there and know someone who could show you the place from a perspective other than tourist.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  I love it that some of you are up for a Texas invasion, come on down here ya'll!|`|Eymzs5AUaa	Here I am a day late and a dollar short again.  Ted makes many good points in endorsing JJ.  I would like to add it's FREE booze for players and judging from the group  that alone is worth the price of admission in defraying travel expenses. <br>  <br>  Vegas has the warmth BE craves and offers the road trip opportunity for her and CMP  While not as exotic as Bora Bora or Antarctica that Scoundy & Lady IHD suggest it does offer a certain exoticness and does provide the heat that MHB seeks.<br>  It certainly falls within MP's anywhere other than my home location.<br>  Now all you need to do is add a Las Vegas contact to pull off AP's  slumber party thingy and you're good to go.|`|UnEQAsEEaa	Could we cruise to Antarctica to see the penguins while there is still some ice?  Some of us have a lot in common with them...  I was thinking of considerate and loyal partners, good fathers, people who can hold their breath for a long time, have webbed feet (well, cloven hooves), spend a lot of time drying out and who like to dress up and stand erect.  And we would not run out of ice for the drinks, either.|`|ba4R1tf1aa	Who's got the most square feet in their house?<br>  The slumber party thingy, I'd do that!<br>  (like anybody would sleep...)|`|AuKKjaxaaa	Anywhere other than my home.  I'd hate to kick people out.  I'd rather be able to just leave.<br>  <br>  But meeting at the Marriott Hotel a few miles from home, with a hot tub and pool below and rooms up above, would be keen.  Maybe get 4 rooms all in one section on either side of the hallway.<br>  <br>  Not that I have that many contacts.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Las Vegas..."what happens in vegas ..stays in vegas"!

That would be like home-coming!<br>  <br>  I am looking forward to meeting all those I truly ever loved...they are all there...<br>  <br>  Or,  maybe we won't remember the First Night.

Like the first set never happened and than it will remake all the films soon there will be Friday te 13th Part II again in 2 years.<br>  The same thing with Nightmare on Elm Street. But it is sadly going to only go up to The Final Nightmare. A New Nightmare was Wes Craven's. He wasn't in the financial buisiness of making these movies. They wont remake Freddy vs Jason for sure they either aren't going to have it at all or make a part 2 of it idk about that. But Nightmare on Elm St. is coming March 6th this year.|`|MHHy90D5aa	yes go here tells you all upcoming horror movies remakes etc|`|4Pjw4Vxqaa	Im not sure of a part 2 to the remake of Friday the 13th but ive read a story for a remake of a nightmare on elm street for 2010 also to let you know their doing another remake of halloween 2 which should be out in about 6 months from now.

I hate it when people just award it to anyone, or someone with thumbs up/down. <br>  First, I wait about 24-48 hours before I start to pick.<br>  Then, I see if any of my contacts answered.<br>  If they did, I go through the ones that answered, and award it to the person who gave the best answer/helped me with my question.  <br>  If NONE of my contacts answered, or they all gave a stupid answer, I pick someone who is NOT my contact. They're answer has to fit these questions.<br>  1.) Did they provide at least ONE sentence?<br>  2.) Did they have more thumbs up than thumbs down?<br>  3.) Were they polite? <br>  4.) If they've had more than 5% best answer.<br>  5.) Did they get a source to show where they got their answer from?<br>  6.) Did they say anything nice to me, such as have a good day or thanks or something! I like it when people do that ha! It isn't THAT big of a deal if they don't though.<br>  <br>  If someone has like 0-4% best answer, that usually means they don't/didn't give a very full answer. But not ALWAYS though. They could have just answered a ton of questions, and still had a lot of best answers.<br>  <br>  As you can see, I have a very strict process, because I HATE it when people just award their best answer to some random person. I give it to the person who deserves it.|`|fZkFgYDmaa	I find the person that i can understand, or one that makes me laugh. The other day i chose someone that flirted with me. Gosh, weak points.

I think they just want to move more towards whom more people are fans of now days., they want to get new artists in commercials. I dont think everyone knows the truth on mike Like the person above. But mikes songs are still played on the radio, and is in commercials. I think they are afraid what some people will think.<br>  <br>  Edit: to ILOVEMJ the mj fans, and the asker , Hey i never said they stoped making VIDEOS of michael, they dont make COMERCIALS with michael in it as much as they use to, thats the whole point of this question. The last one i know about with a michael jackson theme or song was the lizards dancing to thriller last year. That is what this question is aiming for! why michael is not in comercials, why they take him out.<br>  <br>  Simple, comercials usually aim to the younger generation, and they dont realise part of the generation are fans of older generations, so they put new generation artists in comercials, because they are trying to get support.<br>  <br>  who said i didnt do reasearch, We all watch tv dont we? there is our source.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: oh wait her message was towards nicole. Okay never mind, but i answered more of your question anyways.LOL sorry ilovemj|`|ukxt9YdIaa	Yeah i see were your coming from..<br>  many people dont like Michael and maybe some people might complain if they see him on the television all the time ?<br>  As Bad Era Fan said, they try to put more newer celebrities on that more people are fans of now.<br>  But here in Australia his songs are ALWAYS and im talking ALWAYS on the radio, he is in magazines, he is always in our commercials.. its just like the television studios are addicted to Michael.<br>  But i think he should have been in that pepsi show you saw, his commercial was awesome<br>  <br>  Jess xo|`|SvzsXddUaa	They're scared of what people would think of them because the people might not buy their products anymore.<br>  <br>  You know that there are some people who still believes that Michael is a child molester, so that's why.<br>  <br>  ilovemj: Lol, isn't it obvious? She's obviously in love with him, or else she wouldn't be trolling around on MJ questions.|`|P9K7AYmWaa	they're scared of MJ's angel like face =PP it makes them cower.<br>  <br>  or maybe there just immature|`|HURcAIu2aa	Dude I notice that to<br>  I think they are scared.. I think thats fuccking stupid|`|2u8KTDr5aa	Yeah, Michael doesn't fit into the 'Hollywood Hunk' stereotype you need to be popular as a celebrity. Like in his song "They really thought they really had control of me." Hollywood doesn't control Michael and that kills them. He is a threat. <br>  <br>  I wanted a picture of Mikey on my Birthday cake and they wouldn't do it. People cannot accept him. They are close minded, judge mental fucks, and don't deserve to even speak his name.

tLI94qWNaa	Do not trust random sites such as that one, they are most likely a scam.  I lost 160 bucks once when I went to a site to order movies like that, and I never got them.

If you're very thin and bony, the clothes will all fit great on you but you'll just look like you're not being fed enough, once you're naked. Plus, during lovemaking, it's nice to have some cushioning, and that goes for both sexes.<br>  <br>  Skinny girls look great in clothes but curvy ones look great in bed.|`|5UdgZEn4aa	Hm... I've only dated one really skinny girl I liked her but the feeling of skin and bones was too much.

Ci7YWC4paa	I've not seen the movie myself, however, my mum and younger sister went to see it and very much enjoyed it. Although, apparently two young boys were there and left because it was rather girly. I wouldn't see it myself but you might like it.|`|lzA5ZeLfaa	No i watched it and didn't think much of it. it drags on way to much at the beginning and can be confusing at first wiv so many characters. The final ending was ok but just an average film your not missing much if you didn't watch it. Saying that people in the movies didn't think much of it and a group of people walked out during the middle of it muttering i've never seen such a boring movie in my life so should give you a idea :)|`|vsq9SW9Maa	My sister saw it and said no.  I'm not going to bother, even with the all-star cast.  It's just not that funny.

000db28fb52ab31dee59ac037328db75aa	Rogue (Jet Li) uses a Generation 1 Walther P99 with a QPQ-finished slide. However, in one of the more glaring Hollywood firearms inaccuracies in recent memory, Rogue's P99 is neither the 9x19mm nor the .40 S&W version. Instead, it is depicted as being chambered for the 5.7x28mm round - the same round FN's Five-SeveN and P90 guns use, and a round that is significantly longer than the two calibers it can be chambered for.
QfYGhtVwaa	Tee hee yes!, they are using the 'bench of doom' to it's full potential as always. Why do they all want to sit outside in the winter when their homes are so close by?. Madness!!

Cracking-up and outright laughing.<br>  <br>  Sitting across a sofa from my 101-yr old grandfather, as he talks about how he started/began his printing business -- in the late-1920s... and reflects on world events, family, local things... purely free.<br>  <br>  Talking, something fulfilling conversationally.. or, an especially funny & fun-loving friend just making things light. Same thing across a table at a restaurant or bar, with old friends. And you catch that moment, that its the Thing to Do.<br>  <br>  Coming home from a hard day of work -- and seeing a bounding puppy hauling at you, so happy your home that it's falling over itself & sliding on the flloor while wagging its tail to greet you.

AA10838250	I believe, thank you for asking|`|vGH9ghiKaa	Honey, the people that meet me tell others, "I just met an Angel".|`|5Ioe0GE8aa	What is with you and angels?|`|5hbNtQDIaa	No, i dont believe in God or Jesus either. its someting people a long time ago made up to give a reason for life even when there was no proof of it. Humans just like living with anwsers...its who we are. and we were desperate for a reason to live and the afterlife so someone made this up. there is no proof of god, jeses, or angels. in fact reality proves the opposite. all the **** thats going on in the world, all the people suffering and no one comes to there rescue, homeless people starving to death. there is no reason for that. and people who deny this have it too good and doesnt know the horrible pain of our soceity...and most will deny that to. only when u r pushed to the edge and have it tough do u realize the sad truth. and sometimes its just better not to know cus te truth hurts to much. so we made this all up. we dont know what happens. the only thing that makes most sence to me is reincarnation. but if people see angels there can be a few possiblities...either they r hullisinating which can happen if u r under too much stress or arent getting enough sleep, were drunk or high, or they made it up or made themself believe they saw it to feel better for whatever reason.|`|BLEYaodFaa	Yes, I believe in angels.  I believe the same as you.  Angels are not how they are portrayed in paintings, movies, or such.  I also believe angels are not meant to be on this earth for long moments in time.  They are here to help a person heal, finish something, die, or find something or someone, and then they go back to the special place that angels are from.|`|ZbZnIcoIaa	Blah blah blah. You're not going to convince me.<br>  <br>  Bring me cold, hard, evidence. Not just some hallucinations  you had as a teenager.|`|NqlWkqm9aa	Well I have been told I resemble a hot angel. I've also been called a hotter, younger version of Brad Pitt.

In fact, I can go further than that and say that my husband is one - he's dead|`|z6DIHEG3aa	angels are symbols that shows that when people die you will have an after life but all of this was made up because humans are the only species that know that they will die and people make up religions so they have something to look forward to.|`|60jY2iBsaa	I believe in angels.They are God's messengers. And I think we've "seen" angels, but not been aware of them because, as you seem to be pointing out - they are not the pretty people with wings and halos seen in art.|`|4KbYMdluaa	Did you tell your parents your room was illuminating and they didn't take you to the ER, Angel or not, as a parent I'd be thinking MRI.|`|0GNI2Kcnaa	People don't see angels because they don't exist.|`|ym04vDkcaa	you can't see the good things in life|`|elw3QEZOaa	People don't see angels because they're not real.

If anything they are depicted as creatures more like humans but cooler and have wings.

AbqkNfJoaa	Lol, you can't.<br>  <br>  Unless.<br>  <br>  You know someone who knows the band, and can get you on, supervised. I've been to 482948203232 concerts, and have even gotten young girls onto tour buses. Bands (band GUYS) are very reluctant to let underaged girls on their tour buses, without an adult chaperone, because well, teenage girls have a tendency to lie about what goes on on said tour buses. <br>  <br>  Sure, you're probably not one of those girls, but generally, bands have a lot at risk, and as you can imagine, wouldn't be too happy about some 17 year-old chick telling the press that the lead singer touched her naughty bits, when, in reality, she had an orange soda, took a couple pictures, and left to go blog about it all on MySpace.|`|Xb3eRkmtaa	As far as getting on the bus goes, it depends on the band.  I wouldn't count on getting on a bus if you have no intention of getting smashed and putting out. (But considering you're underage, you can probably rule out having that option.  That is, depending on the age of the band's members.)  Besides, a lot of bands are still in vans right now.<br>  <br>  Usually bands hang out by their merch tables before, after and sometimes during show.  Don't be severely annoying when you talk to the members or else you definitely won't be making it onto the bus.|`|CfvgcYMhaa	connections.<br>  or money.<br>  <br>  pretty much theres no way unless your rich, or have connections.<br>  <br>  what band?<br>  I may have a connection.|`|DioXrjBIaa	Pay money.<br>  <br>  Money makes the world go 'round 'round 'round...|`|hzAidxdkaa	take off your top|`|zFwjZy53aa	exploit yourself

qVhqc019aa	It does not bother me, little girls are little girls, they are going to be attracted to makeup. My little cousin, Sky, she LOVES lip gloss, and I personally find nothing wrong with it. If they see their moms using it, they will want to, too, and I think it inspires creativity, its kind of like crayons...<br>  <br>  ?|`|AA10771601	as long as it's just for dress up it's okay and they aren't going out in it...|`|uQrIdrjfaa	great parenting lol|`|fq16glb5aa	ha its gay.|`|OaXsSAPdaa	Um, I don't really know what the kits from the Dollar General are, but I think playing OCCASIONALY with SOME makeup is okay.<br>  <br>  Like if a little girl's mom is going out and puts on lipstick, and can put some on her daughter before she leaves :) <br>  Or if a little girl has a dance recital or it's Halloween, lipstick, blush and maybe a teeny bit of eyeshadow is fine.<br>  <br>  I would not put foundation, concealer, mascara, or anything like that on a little girl though.|`|GTsKitahaa	Most little girls love to do that.

I respect any preferences(I will so not refer to it as "difference")anyone may have. I hope your mother will understand you too.

But I guess once she understands that this is actually the way the things are, she will totally respect and support you.<br>  <br>  I really wish you the best!|`|UyYoxd3waa	Darn Lacy, this is just a bit of a tough one.<br>   I myself am not Gay, just really happy and all, but I respect your right to be what ever makes you happiest in life. So bearing that in mind I think I can say in all honesty that I do support you and if you need to really talk to someone about how you feel you can e-mail me and I'll be more that happy to listen and be as helpful as I can to help you be more comfortable with your self...K?|`|gsOTYg79aa	She didn't mean it because she didn't think you were serious.  She probably didn't think anything of it. Forgive her.  Sit her down for a serious heart to heart talk and maybe she will understand better if she knows you are serious.  This is a serious decision to tell your mom and it takes a lot of strength.  She might not understand at first because it is different and she obviously isn't expecting it.  Maybe you can tell her not to say anything and just to listen and hold off all comments and judgements until she has a chance to think about it.  Let her know and give her time, it may take a while, it is a big change since it is not something she is expecting.<br>  <br>  Tell her you really need her support and she is your mother and hopefully she will stand behind you no matter what.<br>  A mother should have unconditional love for you.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you :)<br>  <br>  ps I am here for you|`|91a2b9fe0d0ef5781c3a0beca8dcdd82aa	big hugs. i am so sorry to hear it. but there is hope that she will come around. just be strong.<br>  and for what its worth, i am behind you all the way. and if you ever need a friend to talk to, i am here for you.|`|cgfbfc6Vaa	I'm here for you lol:) I don't think it really means the same if you tell people theydon'tt have to mean it though lol.<br>  Things will sort out with your mum im sure..

PaNsZxndaa	Both|`|AL6CPHKFaa	Ritz crackers are a type of cracker designed to be eaten on their own, or with a topping. The Ritz Cracker Brand is made by a subsidiary of Kraft Foods [1]. They are circular in shape, salted lightly on one side, and have small scalloping around the edges. A single serving (approximately 5 crackers) contains 79 calories and 4 grams of fat, or 70 calories and 2.5 grams for whole wheat.<br>  Contents<br>  [hide]<br>  <br>      * 1 History<br>      * 2 Ritz in the US<br>      * 3 Ritz in Canada<br>      * 4 Ritz in the UK<br>      * 5 References<br>      * 6 External links<br>  <br>  [edit] History<br>  <br>  Ritz were created in 1928 by the National Biscuit Company (or Nabisco). . Another reason might be that, back then RITZY meant fancy.[citation needed] Ritz can be found at the elegant Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where it is still a regular feature on the menu.<br>  <br>  [edit] Ritz in the US<br>  A box of American cheese Ritz Bits sandwiches<br>  <br>  Ritz crackers are available in the following varieties: Original, Low Sodium, Reduced Fat, Whole Wheat, Roasted Vegetable and Honey Butter.[2]<br>  <br>  In the U.S. and Canada, "Ritz Bits Sandwiches" are sold. They are miniature-sized Ritz cracker sandwiches with several types of filling in between the two crackers. The flavors of filling used to be: Cheese, Peanut Butter, S'mores, and Peanut Butter and Jelly. A pizza version was sold in the early 1990s and again in the early 2000s. Plain Ritz Bits were also sold. Ritz crackers were also available in a toasted crisp chip called "Ritz Toasted Chips" and in an elongated form known as Ritz Sticks.<br>  <br>  For a while, there were two Ritz Bitz flavors including Peanut Butter and Fudge, which consisted of half peanut butter and the other half fudge, and the other Extreme Cheese. Extreme Cheese is similar to regular cheese flavor, except the cracker also contains cheese flavor in it.<br>  <br>  [edit] Ritz in Canada<br>  <br>  Ritz crackers in Canada are available in many varieties: Original, Low Salt, Brown Sugar, Reduced Fat, 100% Whole Grain, Cheddar, etc.<br>  <br>  Ritz Snackwiches are also available, and Ritz Crackers are also a part of the Handi Snacks line, with Cheez whiz and Kraft Peanut Butter.<br>  <br>  Although the Ritz Chips in the US has been rebranded, the name is still available in Canada. Flavors include: Original, Barbecue, Cheddar, Sour Cream & Onion, Multigrain, and Veggie.<br>  <br>  [edit] Ritz in the UK<br>  <br>  Ritz crackers are available in the UK in 3 varieties. Original and Cheese flavor are sold in 200g boxes, and Ritz Cheese Sandwich (a cheesy filling sandwiches between two Ritz crackers) is available in 125g roll packs and 33g snack packs.|`|UdemZ27caa	ritzz|`|zAPzCIBEaa	Triscuit|`|iT2zgXdYaa	triscuit|`|g8WQKTNTaa	Ritz bits fit ( Ritz crackers )|`|V2RNpIFZaa	ritz crackers|`|8RyN4Ff3aa	Ritz Crackers all the way!|`|tXrtRFoNaa	there both so ******* good, I'm definitly buying some this weekend|`|5TMzUFmsaa	RITZ|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Yes, with a mild salsa, and a Coke.

AA11729534	Hundreds & hundreds rolled up in several bunches wrapped in rubber bands.  I was walking one way - and older man walking another with a young woman with a baby in a buggy in front of me and the wind was blowing and there it was right on the sidewalk - she didn't see it but me and the old man did and it blew right under her buggie.  Neither of us pounced on it and we both simultaneously told her to hurry and pick it up and quick shove it in her purse.  It was obviously drug money - how or why it was there just like that is beyond me, but somehow - someway we all KNEW it was meant for her.

A couple people MIGHT mention it if it was loud enough for them to hear... but those things said in cars (in a busy driveway) are hard to hear.<br>  Even if they did hear it, you'll probably only hear references to it for a day or so... no biggie. If you can laugh about it and say how weird your mom is, nobody will care and you'll all be laughing together.<br>  <br>  Now, when a mother brings your lunch to your home room, kisses you on the cheek, and makes you tell her how much you love her in front of your home room... THAT would be embarassment that would last.

AA11280101	Sure, why not? A lot of people say Metallica has gone Alternative. I think they are still writing good music, you have to remember the Load albums were made when they were going through rehab. St. Anger was trying to regroup themselves. Death Magnetic is back to heavy but not like the 80's stuff. Everyone wants them to be "Master Of Puppets" again, sorry not gonna happen, that music was fueled by alchohol and drugs. I have followed Metallica since their underground demo "No Life Til Leather" and I think the music is great. So yeah they might do a greatest hits and continue to make albums I'll buy'em all!|`|u7O8rlBwaa	heheh<br>  well lets be realistic for a moment.<br>  i don't want anyone to get mad because honestly i am a big Metallica fan:<br>  <br>  if they ever did release a Greatest Hits Album it would probably friggan consist of:<br>  - a 4 disk CD box set<br>  - a 2 disk demo set<br>  - another 2 or 3 disks worth of DVD material (live performances)<br>  - another DVD of Interviews amd Commentary<br>  - and a booklet of the History of Metallica.<br>  <br>  And it would probably cost a fortune, and have to be directly mailed to you.<br>  <br>  i don't think it would be worth it.<br>  <br>  i really don't think that they will any time soon if at all. they aren't that dumb.|`|vK9Vv9gjaa	please they have done enough damage to themselves, metallica for your your own safety stop, I love your old stuff but the new sh*t is well sh*tty, and if you want a greatest hit collection, buy the first 4 cds.<br>  <br>  Don'T get me wrong I have been a big fan for a long time but enough is enough, I think my ears are starting to bleed.|`|U4kReIJ6aa	Probably- they're at that point in their career|`|Lgzb4U6laa	Maybe they might. . . i'm not sure.

Also, as much as I like Metallica, they should just quit while they're ahead|`|yFX0mdOhaa	I think they will come out with a greatest hits album.  It would be a big seller.<br>  <br>  I'm sure they will make more albums.

U9iTDxspaa	Hannibal is the best evil psychotic mastermind ever. <br>  Not scary, just amazing. <br>  A classic.|`|tLI94qWNaa	It is not scary at all, when people say that I laugh in their face.  It is my number one favorite movie in the whole world, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  I dont think that it is an overrated film at all, I think that it is a classic and deserves to be respected like one.|`|cIqpL3tGaa	I know tons of people, and not one of them loves it THAT much.|`|59b1fddc617491e538d31b5a8aa3904aaa	I never thought it was "scary" but I'm a grown man.<br>  I thought parts were intriguing , others hilarious.<br>  The part where that pretty thing does the dance in front of the mirror to the song goodbye horses was sexy .<br>  <br>  "Would cha ?"...<br>  <br>  5 stars !|`|z1C75GIaaa	It's not all that scary, but you need to watch Hannibal Lecter and Red Dragon, they are all connected...|`|8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	It's unbelievable isn't it ? That movie does not make any sense in the first place. Hated it myself.|`|5wVeLrXuaa	idk that movie sucks|`|1UKr652Uaa	I personally don't find it too scary- eerie yes, but not scary. I also believe that this is an amazing film. It is brilliantly directed and the story is gripping and personal. Also Anthony Hopkins' performance is considered one of the all-time greats, and I personally agree. He had the role of a haunting, eerie genius down pat in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Not everybody's going to agree on how movies are viewed, it's just general opinion that Silence of the Lambs is one of the best.|`|ZACMoCdWaa	I launched into a four paragraph reasoning behind why this is one of the best psychological thrillers, but it was getting far too complex.  Long and short of it is that it is not a horror movie and it is not supposed to be scary, it is a psychological thriller that offers insight into serial killers and the things that drive them and their process.  It has so much symbolism in it that practically every scene has something significant about the human race or the characters embedded into it. And for its time, lets face it, there was no better thriller out there.|`|9B9H9CEGaa	well u dont think it scary because it was made before ur time and u dont appreciate great peices of ......i dont either but thats what its like .......ok like when frankenstein came out people fainted in the theater because it was so scary but that was made in the 1930's nd was the first of its kind so is silence of the lambsit was made before ur time and made people think it was real.....but it was based on a true story which made it scarier|`|PW1vXqruaa	It was an almost by the book translation of a hugely popular and well-written novel which in my opinion had less to do with the horrendous goins-on that it did with the dance Clarice and Hannibal Lecter were doing because that's what it was and had not that relationship(sick as it sounds) worked,he film would have been just another slog into the horror/thriller genre. Bur everyone,again in my opinion,was the the top of their game and pulled me into the on-going,relentless suspense,even though I know how it would all turn out|`|e590942052eafadec97fac23e298a2f1aa	I think it's rubbish.<br>  <br>  Jodie Foster's acting is terrible.

WQvDIhmgaa	I guess thats left up to interpretation the "suspicious" part at least.  Its been a while since that has happened to me...|`|09e9e668bf34764b457b9ea98c39eb5daa	About once a month when I had my TransAM even when I had cruise control on 5 miles below the speed limit but I never got a ticket <G><br>  <br>  Now the airport is another story, I'm always the randomly picked passenger in line for the pat down, guess cause I'm the most harmless looking.  Go figure (yes I look like my avatar).|`|qJaurSycaa	some jerk when i was about 20. i had an old car that stalled in a left turn lane. the cop was going straight and coming from the opposite direction. he zoomed around and pulled me over. i asked why and he said 'your registration's expired, the muffler's no good and you made everyone sit through the turn light'. i said the car stalled and that's why i missed the light. the muffler's ok it's just banging because it's missing a u bolt. and handed him the registration i'd just gotten and hadn't put on yet. <br>  coming from the opposite direction, how could he tell the tags weren't current.<br>  if the car was stalled and not running, how could he tell the muffler was making noise.<br>  <br>  he was still being a jerk so i told him to give me a ticket or let me go. no ticket of course.|`|AA11016425	I got pulled over because I matched the description of someone.

fEkKuGlEaa	With my first foster child, a woman had signed up through the county program to provide backpacks and clothing for her to start school. I received two huge trash bags full of brand new clothes, with tags still attached so I could return anything that didn't fit. There was a backpack and new sneakers. <br>  <br>  The lady had really put a lot of thought into picking out clothes a little girl would like and that would look stylish. I told my foster daughter, who was feeling totally unloved at the time, that she had a friend who had sent her this gift. As she pranced about trying on her new clothes I could hear her say to herself, "I have a friend. I have a friend." It was an incredible pick-me-up for this child. <br>  <br>  Every time I think of that lady, I ask God to bless her, whoever she is.|`|UxSF3Doaaa	One time I saw a small bag of clothing on my mailbox, but I'm not sure where it came from.

But God bless that person who did it, even though I did not need it.|`|urmhRHwxaa	I had a car accident in Indiana when I lived in Chicago.  I had to give the cops a signed document allowing them to tow it back to Illinois, but it was near impossible for me to get all the way back to Indiana just to drop off a piece of paper.  A lady at the police station allowed me to fax my permission and dropped it off at the towing company herself.|`|YIAZmSW7aa	Someone from R&S once sent me $500 to help me pay for an important medical procedure that I could not afford.<br>  <br>  It wasn't anonymous, but still--that was probably the kindest thing ever done for me by someone who didn't even really know me that well.  I will never forget her.

KFjEkOlPaa	$800 for birch and basswood shells? No thanks. <br>  <br>  I don't care how many bass drums you get but if I'm spending 800 those darn shells better be all maple or birch. <br>  <br>  Signature drum sets usually suck balls. Like that pearl forum that the idiot from the red hot chili peppers designed. Piece of garbage. <br>  <br>  Also you may want to re-think the two bass drums. It's a pain to tune them both to sound the same. I prefer one bass drum with a double pedal. Also easier to transport to gigs. Some gigs just don't have the space to accomodate a monster kit. <br>  <br>  Look into DDrum dominion Maple. They have double and single bass kits. Also look on Ebay.|`|PeuFnqQwaa	Its a good kit, might be a bit to much to handle for a starter kit. You should possibly look at a 5 piece version of the same kit.

R1sby9xWaa	1. Have a good reason to get up.<br>  <br>  I’ve found this to be the single most important element in being an early riser. Days in which I did not crystallise the reasons for getting up were more likely to result in sleep ins. Now, I make it clear the night before what it is I want to wake up early for. Initially, I found writing things down to be helpful, but this isn’t always necessary, as long as it is clear what the reasons are.<br>  <br>  2. Be productive in the mornings.<br>  <br>  It wasn’t enough to just be an early riser. If I had committed to waking up early for a reason, I’ve found it was crucial that I followed through. Not following through is like slow working poison. Over time, this has a cumulative effect and makes it harder and harder to rise early. This was a huge drain on motivation for me, especially when I was losing sleep and yet not getting the things I wanted to done. So stick to the plan and be productive.<br>  <br>  3. Get enough sleep.<br>  <br>  Your body is trying to tell you something if you constantly feel overly tired during the day. I’ve found it wasn’t really worthwhile trying to get up early if I didn’t get enough good sleep the night before. In the short term, I might get more discretionary time because I was sleeping less, which is good for coping with the spikes in workload. However, in the long term, things generally evened out - either because I was tired and couldn’t work as fast or I was sick as a result of a weakened immune system. My advice is to ensure you get enough sleep.<br>  <br>  4. Go to bed earlier<br>  <br>  One simple thing which helped me get enough sleep was to … well … go to bed earlier. Instead of constantly staying up past midnight and feeling tired the next morning, I now start preparing for bed around 11pm. I’ve found, around this time of night, I’m generally winding down anyway and not engaged in productive work. So shifting the hours around slightly has meant that overall my free time gets used more effectively - which is the primary reason for being an early riser! The amount of sleep needed is different from person to person and day to day. So, I listen to my body when it tells me that it is tired and it is time for bed.<br>  <br>  5. Sleep more effectively.<br>  <br>  The other thing I noticed about sleep is sleeping longer doesn’t necessarily translate to sleeping better. Somedays I can have 8 hours of sleep, yet feel like I haven’t slept at all. Other days I can be fully alert, productive and cheerful after only a few short hours.<br>  <br>  If you find that you are still tired after a good stretch of 6-8 hours, chances are you’re not sleeping well. Most people just don’t need much more sleep than that. Sleeping well can be attained in various ways. I find having a good mattress and pillow with some quiet reading time before bed to be helpful.<br>  <br>  6. No more another 10 mins.<br>  <br>  I think everyone including me has two conflicting aspects to their personality. There’s the one which is good and generally seeks to self improve and be productive. Then there’s the other one - the little voice in the head urging us to sleep in for another 10 mins. I’ve learned the hard way that this little voice rarely has anything good to say. My advice is don’t ever have a discussion with him or indulge in anything he says! Sleeping in for another 10 mins is guaranteed to lead to another 10 mins and then another. The next time you hear that little voice, just say “No” out loud and …<br>  <br>  7. Jump out of bed.<br>  <br>  One trick I’ve found to be very effective in being an early riser and to stop myself from rationalising is to simply jump out of bed instantly. Once I am outside the comforts of the warm and cozy bed, I’m more likely to actually wake up and stay up. Someone once suggested to me by leaving the bedroom immediately, you also leave no doubt about your intentions to actually wake up and start doing things. Jumping out of bed and leaving the room actually works. They have prevented me from sleeping in on many a cold winter morning.<br>  <br>  8. Use an alarm clock, just not the snooze.<br>  <br>  Every day without fail, I wake up before the alarm goes off. I’m tempted to say setting it might not even be necessary! However, I take comfort in the knowledge that it’s there and waiting to go off, so I don’t have to worry about sleeping in. The trick with the alarm clock is to make it loud, annoying and not easily accessible. Try placing it away from arms reach, so that you can’t turn it off or get to the snooze button unless you get up out of bed. For me, this works wonders, because when it goes off, my wife and daughter are both still asleep and I instinctively try to get to it as quickly as possible.<br>  <br>  9. Establish a stable routine.<br>  <br>  What I recently learned from being a new dad is babies thrive on routine. My daughter now knows that bath time is followed by reading time and then bed time. Initially, she put up a fight resisting the bed. Now, she expects it!<br>  <br>  In many ways, things are no different for us adults. I view the body as an instrument which can be|`|ne2sEeLJaa	For me I have like 3 alarm clocks going off at one.<br>  <br>  1. my broken phone, I can't turn the alarm off, because the screen is broke.<br>  <br>  2.

I don't like him as a person very much, but he is an amazing chef.|`|aUyopOWiaa	A winner wasn't announced last night. I did like the twist of bringing Jeff back, though. I was pretty upset he didn't win, because he really cooked his heart out and I wanted him to stay and that would have hopefully sent Stefan home. I'm also really upset the Fabio got sent home. He was my favorite of those four! For next week when the winner is announced, I would like it to be Carla.|`|9c5de07d75d981b60774ab1e37de89bfaa	The finale will be next Wednesday, Feb 25.

I have always learned something new from younger gals, and my relationships have always been mutually beneficial.|`|vmMaWOFvaa	thats not always true. but i think its because they want to feel younger and younger girls like go for sometimes older guys now. i dont know but i think i pretty much stay in my age for guys. they can be a little older then me and a little younger but not like 3 or 4 years.|`|Rje9KD8waa	very simply that a younger girl will look more attractive,will not be wanting to spend lots of time moaning about life,and will be more fun to be with,<br>  Very few older women,are full of life and like fun<br>  <br>                            Dermot|`|1f56cJB3aa	not always true.<br>  actually hardly ever true.<br>  its pretty lame if you are with a younger girl where i live. <br>  <br>  older men w/ younger women/its like a status thing|`|Nw6ljCSJaa	because younger girls tend to be more naive and for the most part they can be persuaded to do just about anything.|`|ffab01a92e978af828e5f1703775e5ddaa	Think of it this way....<br>  <br>  Do you shop for clothes at Goodwill if you don't have to?|`|QH4a4mPFaa	Why do younger girls like older guys?|`|6L4n6CFaaa	I've always wondered this.<br>  my fiance is six years older.|`|i8wie1Qjaa	So they can train them|`|92bfHoowaa	good question|`|5d21037f5fbe906b1600559280b7a081aa	because they are young and fresh lol

Womenn are abused every 5Min's. I know there celebs, but its between them. Only they know what happened. We will never know the truth. My only thing is that I bet its hard for his mom to know this about her son. I just hope they both get therapy. Chris was around domestic abuse sometimes this rubs off. He shouldve got therapy then. Im a victim of abuse. At the end of the day its her choice if she wants to go back. I know ididn'tt. She will be forever scared. With help she will be able to move on. Its sad but we do have other things that are going on in the world. the media chooses to keep dredging it up. the more they focus the worse it seems to get. we just need to pray for them and their families.

His parents throw him out so they can indulge in sado-masochism and he is sacked from his job, dumped by his girlfriend and dropped from his football team. It has elements of Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis, as a pitiless God who transforms him into a fly as punishment for wasting his life. <br>  A Soft Touch: Kevin McKidd plays a cuckolded husband while Gary McCormack is Larry, the ruthless upstairs neighbour who steals his electricity and his wife, played by Michelle Gomez. <br>  The Acid House: An acid trip and a bolt of lightning result in amiable schemie Coco Brice exchanging places with the baby of a middle class couple. <br>  All three sections are independent, but are linked by setting and by the reappearance of incidental characters, in particular Maurice Ro?ves who appears variously as an inebriated wedding guest, a figure in a dream, and a pub patron. All three of his parts symbolize a human manifestation of God.<br>  <br>  The film offended elements of the UK tabloid press with a depiction of a cynical and jaded, foul-mouthed God, and in some countries (such as Canada and the United States) has been shown on television with subtitles because of most characters' heavy Scottish accents.<br>  <br>  <br>  Being Human is a 1993 film starring Robin Williams.<br>  <br>  The film portrays the experience of a single human soul (portrayed by Williams) through various incarnations. Williams is the only common actor throughout the stories that span man's history on the earth.<br>  <br>  The film was written and directed by Bill Forsyth for David Puttnam while he was in control of Columbia Studios in 1989. When Putnam was ousted Being Human was pulled from the distribution schedule and was given a limited release in 1993. Being Human was Ewan McGregor's screen debut.<br>  <br>  Sam Gillen (Van Damme) is a convict who gets sprung from Federal custody somewhere in the Midwest by his bank-robbing partner. In their last heist, Sam's partner killed a bank guard, and Sam took the rap for it. Sam's partner gets killed in the break, forcing Sam to go it alone in search of the loot, which is buried on the property of a farm inhabited by Clydie Anderson (Arquette), the widowed mother of two kids named Mike "Mookie" Anderson and Bree Anderson.<br>  <br>  Attempting to sneak into Clydie's house and "borrow" some salt for a campfire-broiled steak, Sam catches sight of Clydie taking a shower. The next morning, Sam is spotted bathing outdoors by Mookie. After saving Clydie, Mookie, and Bree from a trio of intruding thugs, Sam discovers that Clydie is holding out from selling her place to property developer Franklin Hale, who fears that he will be put out of business if he doesn't get Clydie's land so he can develop on it.<br>  <br>  Sam decides to hang around, sleeping first in Clydie's barn and then in her bed while repairing her late husband's Triumph motorcycle. And Hale hires an intimidation expert named Dunston, to force Clydie into selling her land. Secretly on Hale's payroll is corrupt sheriff Lonnie Cole, a sometime lover of Clydie.<br>  <br>  A jealous Lonnie discovers Sam's true identity and threatens to expose him if he doesn't leave. Not wanting to place Clydie in additional danger for helping a fugitive, Sam decides to leave, only to find that Hale has already blown the whistle on him in an attempt to get him out of the way. After evading police chasing him in cars, land rovers, helicopters, and on motorcycles and horseback, Sam returns to save Clydie from Dunston and Hale, who are planning to burn down her house.<br>  <br>  After fighting off the bad guys and getting Hale caught holding a gun to Clydie's head, he decides to turn himself in, rather than run away. He promises to be back to live with them.
G6Uy43coaa	I'm a cry baby!<br>  <br>  Being happy, sad, angry, hurt, hearing a song that has memories, watching a touching movie, waiting with a child who is crying because they thought their parents would visit them but they did not come, telling a parent they can no longer see their children because their rights have been terminated, weddings, funerals...I am a cry baby and proud of it.

It's pretty scary, and I wouldn't watch by yourself.  "The Sixth Sense" has good costumes/makeup, and it has some parts that make you jump, but it's not too scary.  "The Blair Witch Project" is pretty stupid with lots of language, but the last scene some people think is scary.  "Psycho" is an old horror film in black and white, but don't let that put you off.  It has the famous "shower scene" in it, is the original source of the music that you always hear when something scary in a movie happens (you'll know when you hear it).  I've heard that "The Grudge" and "Strangers" are really scary too.|`|eoBUQlZFaa	Silence of the lambs is great!

D4OCM8yUaa	Of course we are all equal. It says that in the Bible. It also says that we shouldn't worry about what we are going to eat tomorrow, what we are going to wear tomorrow, or where we are going to sleep tomorrow, because God will take care of us. People just care too much on their outward apperences. Ya, it's nice to look good, but we shouldn't be judged on that. Some of my very best friends aren't really that pretty, and that doesn't matter. If I had to say who I thought was a better person, me or them, I would most definentily say them. They are all good, Christian people, and they are all really nice. Your outward apperance has nothing to do with anything. On Judgement Day, you could get all dressed up, but God doesn't care. That will have nothing to do about if you would get into heaven or not. If God doesn't care, then why should we?|`|jsgKGtdBaa	God didn't make us sweetheart.|`|utGddhnVaa	its pretty clear where not all equal... on certain level's at least|`|e55d4a01420a2827c4108baf10b7d77daa	God made us all equal (but not the same, equal in the sense that nobody is better than anyone else), but some people forget that. Some people interpert that in the Animal Farm way "all people are equal, but some people are more equal than others".
uW7XLCF3aa	Here's the deal...you come with me down to the biker bar, buy me a few drinks, but I wouldn't eat a spider, no matter how tiny it was, not even for a million bucks!<br>   Wait a minute,... lets skip the whole "bar/spider" thing, come back to my house and share a couple of bowls.|`|VXCCjdZhaa	Yeah, no way.

uYoBoHmNaa	Ultimately, it depends on whether everyone involved is consenting. Running up to a stranger involves someone who may not want to participate. If you're sitting around in a circle with your friends, then everyone is fair game. Anyway the last point is that assuming everyone consents to being involved, you always have the option to get up and walk away if the dare is unreasonable or uncomfortable for you. Oh and I forgot, no destroying public property...|`|OaXsSAPdaa	Um, truth or dare is a great game.<br>  If you are an idiot like you are, then it's not fun anymore.<br>  But most of the normal people have a blast and don't play for money, most people have better friends, and most people don't dare things like that.|`|5XPLlSvpaa	i would be hella angry if some strange Girl  kissed my bf infront of me. <br>  I wouldn't hit you though. <br>  I know truth and dare can be very daring|`|EtSPbSzcaa	Dam you kids get out of school early|`|x7CmpR6baa	If you play it that way it is...|`|FDt7cC8haa	they are YOUR friends.....who's the dummy?|`|8Zcu55Braa	hehe yes, ....which is  why i don't play that game again since years ago|`|YSdwkhHRaa	She wasn't aware it was a dare?<br>  That's kind of lame of her.<br>  <br>  When we play, there are usually rules against making people cheat on their S/O like that. And when we play, if you choose not to do a dare, everyone gets to slap you in the back of the neck.<br>  <br>  The purpose of truth or dare is solely to find out who you can sleep with at that party, I thought.|`|aYnduRsxaa	If you play like that, with money involved and dares like that, I would hate it too. If you play just for fun and do simple dares, then it could be very fun.|`|aAxIERtUaa	by the way doll, it was a good kiss|`|gUdFFYNTaa	That was  a pretty unreasonable dare for your "friends" to tell you to do.<br>  Truth or dare can be fun, as long as they aren't stupid ridiculous<br>  dares.<br>  <br>  The game "knuckles" is more stupid than truth or dare... <br>  you scrape your knuckles on a concrete curb, and who bleeds first wins.
6yfZOyMRaa	lol, idk. i guess it is just his expression. lol!|`|4qT0TfMZaa	That's his shtick, dude...it makes him more attractive to the young women.|`|SqALjOm7aa	he's got sad,down turned eyes
JL4z0Hm4aa	He gets into Umbridge's office and tries to talk to Sirius via the fireplace/floo network. Kreacher responds and says he is at the department of mysteries when he really isn't. Umbridge finds Harry in the fireplace and Hermione helps by lying to get out of trouble.|`|BKybwvF5aa	He tries to use the flo network to talk to him, but doesn't find him home. The flo network is the fireplace.|`|ndXvMLZ2aa	When Hermione, Luna, Ron and Ginny distract Umbridge and Flinch,  Harry goes to Umbridge's office and uses the fireplace to find out if Sirius is there since the Floo Network in Umbridge's fireplace is the only one that is not being watched by the ministry of magic. He talks to Kreacher who tells Harry that Sirius is not here since he went to the Department of Mysteries.|`|EilAm0Dkaa	When Harry has the vision of Sirius being torchured, he goes to Umbridge's office (it contains the only fireplace still connected to the floo network). He then goes to contact Sirius.. but insted Kreacher is ther and there is no sign of Sirius...when Haryr asks Kreacher, kreacher just says that his master is not there.|`|MTPoGd1qaa	Uses the fireplace in Umbridge's office, but Kreacher is there and tells that Sirius isn't in!|`|52pZj3WFaa	He uses Umbridge's fireplace and asks Kreacher - who tells him a non-truth.

I sang that for four hours at the DMV when that movie first came out.

AA11111233	Yes, she stole a trinket with Nick's name on it from Nick and Phyllis, a brass elephant from Brad, something else, I can't remember what, and she's supposed to steal a book to give to Noah from what I read.<br>  <br>  I have heard rumours that she will get pregnant from the Shilly and not know who the father is, Nick or Billy.  Then I heard that as a result of her fling with Billy, she decided to get her legs sewn shut.<br>  <br>  That last part isn't true, but I sure wish she would.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	Yes along with her whole list of sins she's going to add the "I slept with my brother in law" sin to it. I hope she doesn't end up pregnant.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Yes, she's become a klepto - very odd - she stole trinkets from Brad's house, Phyllis', ... hmm and somewhere else, I can't remember.<br>  Sheesh, I hope she doesn't get pregnant, then there's that whole Who's the Daddy thing...|`|msQqxMIbaa	Yeah!  About the stealing...I understood why she stole from Brad's house.  She took something that she had given him earlier, to remember him by.  But, I was just as confused as you were about her stealing from Nick and Phyllis.  I don't remember anything else that she stole!|`|tEqcmCv3aa	Of course she'll get pregnant because on top of being a slut, she's too stupid to use birth control. She'll lay down with anyone who shows her a little pity. NASTY...and she'll run to Nick. I hope Phyllis kicks the crap out of her!|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	I hope it's not Nick's baby she's pregnant with after her night of pounding back the cocktails! Poor (hypothetical) baby!|`|mSL9pUOKaa	YES (It isn't official but this is typical soaps)! She's going to get preggers and then she won't know who the father is. Billy or Nick.<br>  <br>  Friday she's going to the bar and she's supposedly going to get drunk and leave the bar with Billy...You know what that will lead too. "I was drunk I didn't know what I was doing"<br>  <br>  Then it will be the whole "Who's the Father?" fiasco...Similar to Chloe's situation.<br>  <br>  I can't stand Sharon. And I never heard anything about her stealing...|`|arjB50zBaa	I really dont want to have to go through another "whos the daddy" storyline! I hope that dont happen.<br>  Sharon stealing I think she is on a verge of a breakdown/meltdown.<br>  Its about time I have been waiting for Sharon to tip over for years now the best part for me is Phylis is seriously playing it cool and Sharon not so much....its about time!|`|uVwPykXlaa	she's gone kleptomatic.and yeah she will be pregnant with billy child.<br>  its going to cause a rift btwn the brothers

52pZj3WFaa	Having been in a car accident that resulted in someone's death - I didn't find this funny at all.<br>  <br>  For all concerned (those that survived, that is) this accident will stay with them forever.<br>  <br>  And which bit did you laugh at? The guy crossing the road being killed? The one jumping the light being smashed to bits? Or the people driving through the crossing and having their car flipped?
g2yUDLygaa	I agree with the first poster that your best choice for all-around is the Epiphone Les Paul Special II, and you're talking to someone who has played all four of the guitars you mention.  The ESP LTD Viper-50 is pretty much suited for metal and alternative only, the Dean Vendetta VN1 is also geared more toward metal and alternative and is a crap-shoot in terms of quality (some Dean guitars are put together very well, some are garbage), and the Epiphone G310 is really only suited for rock and metal.<br>  <br>  My mainstay is a 1979 Gibson Les Paul Custom, and I can play pretty much anything with it -- alternative, blues, bluegrass, country, funk, grunge, metal, rock, salsa, thrash; you name it.  As long as you have a good amp and/or a good guitar processor (and I have both) you can make a Les Paul sound great from super-clean to screamin' demon and everything in between.|`|SVqR4Nebaa	not a big fan of those guitars.  Epiphone les paul would by my choice out of those.  I hate ESP i just think they sound like a toy that can only play metal chron scales.<br>  <br>  <br>  Gibson SG all the way :)|`|FAhNWFiQaa	go to eBay and search for Kramer Kramertorium. it is the most badass guitar i've seen!|`|GbyHQQLiaa	I have an Epiphone Les Paul and it sounds great. It's good for every type of music in general.|`|GIlTkQu6aa	EPIPHONE LES PAUL SPECIAL II|`|DUGZa0Zgaa	DON'T get the ESP.  They are cheezy!<br>  <br>  Epiphones are alright, I'm a Fender guy though.

It still has an impact today and I will be seeing it again in April for the umpteenth time.|`|vsPrAqfyaa	Almost Famous: Untitled<br>  <br>  In my openion it is one of the best films of all time because it can connect with the youth. It is about a 15 year old boy who gets to tour with one of his favorite bands and he gets to experience the world. I think that the movie can teach young people that they should take the chance to explore the world if they have a chance because it is an amazing thing. Also it re-enforces the idea that you control your own life and you get to make your own decisions, but there are people who are willing to help you so you dont have to take on to much by yourself.<br>  <br>  Those are just my thoughs on the film, I would suggest that any person who has never seen it do so because it is amazing.<br>  <br>  P.S. The origional "Almost Famous" is not the same as the "Untitled "version. The "Untitled" verison is much better/longer so if you can watch that one, not the origional.|`|EilAm0Dkaa	The Prestige.<br>  By far.<br>  <br>  It's exciting, interesting throughout, leaves you shocked and wanting more.<br>  <br>  It has romance, mystery, rivalry.<br>  <br>  I could actually watch the film again and again, and still discover something new each time.<br>  <br>  I'd really reccomend it to anyone!!|`|mrYX3kU3aa	I love the movie Titanic because not only does it have a great story line but it isn't very historically inaccurate.

I6vMxEU9aa	I've been a subscriber to Netflix for almost 5 years. It's the best deal around, their customer service is FANTASTIC, and the movies come quickly. I have the 3 disc at a time plan, and I pay less than $20 / month. You just keep a list of the movies you want to see on the Netflix site, and they'll send you the next one on the list when you return another. I live in a city where there's a Netflix shipping facility, so if I return a movie on a Monday, they notify me via email that they received it on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, I get my next movie in the mail. (I assume most major cities have a shipping facility so your turnaround time is probably similar.) I've only had maybe 2-3 movies in my five year experience with them that have arrived damaged. As soon as you report it damaged, they'll ship you another one.<br>  <br>  I wholeheartedly recommend getting Netflix. It's the greatest thing since sliced bread. Seriously.

Orx9cTJJaa	You'll cry eventually. I'm sorry to hear about that.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	It can take a while to sink in. You may cry later which often happens. Your mind can be occupied with other things that have it prioritized. Don't worry about it.|`|NY2fpmvPaa	Maybe you're just shocked? I didn't cry when my great grandfather died either. I knew him forever. Since I was born! He died 2 years ago. I'm a very emotional person too. I cry at EVERYTHING. I cry everytime I watch American Idol. I'm lame with the emotions. So...I don't get why I didn't cry when he died. Somestimes...you just ....dont, I guess. It wasn't that I wasn't sad...I was. But, I just didn't cry.|`|Kj8J3clpaa	it probably just hasnt sunk in yet. <br>  or the shock prevailed over the grief<br>  <br>  p.s. my kindergarten teacher died too and she was also really young|`|6Uohf1h1aa	sooo sad. i married my best friend since kindergarten's brother. life long friend|`|6HCezA6zaa	aww... well people die, even if they have done nothing wrong. its just life. i wish is wasnt like that, but it is :(...<br>  <br>  sorry for your loss... :(|`|AA10286634	This is a serious answer. Grief is not a water faucet that comes on at will. There can be a multitude of reasons why you are not crying.  Strange thing is, that if you want to "get it out" you can start the process by just renting a sad movie, like Old Yeller.  Your body will not care what got you started crying, but will allow you to tap into any sorrow near the surface.|`|1M2bTQcsaa	things like that do happen in this world sence i graduated from high school in 1975 (yeah i,m a old guy)half of the teachers i had not just in high school but in the 12 years of schooling in general have died .|`|X5D87bXUaa	well it could be shock or it could be that you don't feel the need to cry because you  weren't that close to her?<br>  <br>    hope that helped?!|`|jeZmqhNcaa	Maybe you're sad & gonna show it in different ways.  I didn't cry when my gramma died because I've seen a lot of people die so its just easier to be like yea they're dead, ok moving on.  As long as you remember them :)|`|vGtM2F5Caa	awwww<br>  sorry my best friends brother died last monday<br>  car accident ( he was high)<br>  and he was a senior|`|VzzQP2PJaa	Your in shock, as well as numb. Its pretty hard to cry when you feel that way.|`|C9etNNBAaa	whoa<br>  im sorry about that.<br>  but if you look at the bright side<br>  she doesnt have to go through pain anymore.|`|39gjtelYaa	I didn't cry when my grandpa died, but I was still very sad. People deal with grief in different ways.<br>  <br>  I'm so sorry for your loss.<br>  <br>  God Bless You|`|GerkxdQOaa	i think that right now you are probably still in denial and still haven't really excepted it but it is ok to cry so maybe you aren't crying now but you eventually will it took me a few years to actually like understand and cry when my second cousin died ( i was pretty young though) dont fell bad and sorry about your friend.|`|EVDh4emTaa	When my grandma died, i didn't cry either.  I wanted to be strong for my mom when she got the news.  It's sorta starting to hit me this year.  At the moment, you might not think about it too much, because you're too busy with living.  It's not your fault or anything.  One day. you'll find yourself randomly crying over her.  Trust me.|`|Dhu8zVxAaa	There are different phases of grieving. At the moment it sounds like you're numb with shock. When the realisation sinks it, you'll probably become more upset. But everyone grieves in different ways, and you may find that tears don't come for a very long time - if ever in some cases. Just don't bottle up your emotions, talk to someone.|`|vC65Ts3Oaa	i have the same "problem". i never cry when people die. my friend died, i didn't cry; my other friends mom died, i didnt cry; and my grandfather is about to die and i haven't shed a tear. idk why but i just cant cry. but the stupid thing is is that when my cat died, i cried...weird but w/e i cant help it(:|`|IqoRBVUTaa	Oh. I am so sorry! I know how it feels to lose those who are close. It stinks.....I've lost lots of people, I think that the pain goes away when your use to the usual loss. Butt that's just in my case. I'm sorry again.<br>  -Ali|`|tFi26EMpaa	i'm so sorry for your loss. just because you're not crying doesn't mean your not hurting and grieving. grief affects everyone different. you might be  feeling slightly shocked at this unexpected death. this is normal. just remember, it's ok to cry. if you can't, that's okay too. <br>  <br>  god bless|`|d8LyjT8Xaa	i'm sorry bout thatt. maybe you didnt really know her that well and you werent that close to her. or maybe your not the emotional type.|`|hWqYrIW3aa	Your like me, i dont cry at anything,<br>  Just talk to someone about how your feeling, dont bottle it up.|`|K77UUk2iaa	you are obviously not sensitive|`|reFaIZpEaa	people grieve in different ways|`|o0Bp8jGmaa	ita part of life... u r not crying beause u r not weak...or u were not very close to her|`|u4jmt2Scaa	awww im sorry. well maybe your not the crying typeee|`|7rzWFt91aa	maybe you're in shock/disbelief|`|y1S4hGZZaa	it might be that you weren't as close to her so you don't realize the loss

When again all it does is make them look like piggish.<br>  <br>  Neither the girls or boys have an respect for themselves or the other one they are with. <br>  <br>  Sex isn't to be used as a weapon and that's exactly what it is used for; sex is suppose to be something meaningful shared between 2 people that love and respect each other.<br>  <br>  I know some will have a response about how "well he/she is the love and my life and i plan on sharing the rest of my life with him/her", well the fact is most teenager relationships do not last.|`|r6oi1HyZaa	its a no go, especially the ones that flaunt it all about; lord will just end it there|`|lNucas6Daa	As long as no one is getting pregnant or acquiring STDs, I see nothing wrong with it.|`|56bNLJykaa	As long as you understand the potential and use protection that's fine|`|PpWosZsIaa	Bad idea|`|p03Jc7eHaa	whatever,i did it as a teen

u9PxChF2aa	Unless you have a urinary problem, then no it won't happen. There could be some conditions that cause people to have the inability to urinate and if that problem isn't taken care of then it might could burst. Or if the bladder is full and is injured (like from a hard hit to the abdomen) it could burst. But in a typical healthy person, you won't be able to hold it long enough for it to burst. Once the bladder fills to a certain point and you don't relieve it, your body will do it for you. There is kind of a reflex where your body will relax the sphincter holding the opening to the bladder. So basically, if you hold it too long, your bladder wont burst, you will just wet yourself.|`|AA12349214	No - you wet yourself long before that happens.<br>  Hopefully not in a public place.|`|SsCmPvWSaa	Mine is about to right now.

The original Exorcist was freaky for a kid sick with the flu at 11.  It gave me nightmares for years!  I also have to add another thriller to this.  Not so much horror but still, The Ghost and the Darkness was awesome, mainly because you know it is a true story!  <br>  <br>  Horror movies these days just do not have the 'WOW' factor for me.  They are sillier then scary.  But then I grew up with Nightmare on Elm Street and the Jason movies...where I giggled through them all.  Kujo was another that scared me and made me laugh.

jT1UU1CUaa	I LOVE Harry Potter! I've attended the past two midnight releases for the films and the past two for the books, also. On the day of the release of Harry Potter 7, I won two, yes TWO Harry Potter trivia contests! One on the radio, and at the mall, earning me the 9th out of 2000 spots to get my book. I went home and read the book, finishing it that day! It was a fantastic end to the series, don't you agree?|`|V1hxvQukaa	i love hp.<br>  <br>  i haven't taken a quiz, but i've read the books and watched the movies. recently, i've really gotten back into the series (i think it has to do with half-blood prince coming out). i'm planning on re-reading all the books...|`|Z98TpALPaa	I don't like it.<br>  The last time ((and first)) I watched Harry Potter was at the movies with my mom and brother ((he's two years older)) when I was in first grade and I fell asleep half way through it. <br>  I just can't get myself to like it.<br>  It's so boring ((to me...sorry.)) and uninteresting.<br>  My friend is OBSESSED with it.<br>  She'd probably score a 100 on that thing,<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|Mp0MTuvDaa	obsessed with the books but not so much the films<br>  <br>  maybe the last two will do justice to the books<br>  done enough bebo quizzes|`|34d016fe94e90591d5f6ad4015e57b33aa	Why is this in "celebrities"?

When I was pregnant with my daughter I would watch Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone every night because it calmed me and made me sleep (my husband worked nights so I was alone a lot).  I am so obsessed with it that before my daughter started REALLY talking (not the mumbling..she was around 15 months) SHE was humming the Harry Potter theme song in bed at night!  Same thing happened when I had my son they love the first 2 movies (they don't watch the other movies cuz they kinda get creepy).  Whenever the books came out I waited in line to get them the first night and I stayed up all night reading them..they took me 2-3 days a piece to finish them cuz I have to be a mommy during the day...then I would go through Harry Potter withdrawls for a week! Lol ya I know..I'm crazy :)  But other than that I'm pretty normal :)|`|52pZj3WFaa	So obsessed that I am reading the series again from the beginning (for the umpteenth time) and obsessed enough to see there is a quiz to find out how obsessed you are, and I'm off to do it now!<br>  <br>  38% - not too bad. Questions were rather repetitive.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I totally love Harry Potter. The movies are okay, but I liked the books better.

tvdabilNaa	People don't want to know the truth.  Our government and the media have been lying to them far too long.|`|3ee64ee7ec766828c5143beacd3dc7f6aa	Michael Moore tends to tell his version of the truth. There are lots of truths out there, and he doesn't have a monopoly on it, though he behaves like he owns the franchise.<br>  I admire his chutzpah, his ability to make involving movies about important issues and his determination to get his points across.<br>  But he also omits information that doesn't back up his point of view, and has occasionally made up data and made assumptions that, although they sound convincing, don't have any real veracity.<br>  You might want to check your own assumptions before you start throwing the word "ignorant" around.|`|sZMa0s7Baa	Because he brings up no other sides of the argument like a real professional journalist would and some of his points are completely ridiculous.<br>  <br>  What, so you're either on Michael Moore's side or you're on Bush's side? It ain't just black and white, there's a lotttt of grey area.|`|QMMmUWwhaa	Because he is an *** about it.

QDUKHGIOaa	Anime is known as Japanese Animation, basically cartoons from Japan.  The big difference in cartoons from Japan is that the artist take the practice to another level.  When you watch anime, you will notice a lot of face expressions, camera angles, thousands of color variations.  Anime has become very popular as well in the United States in my opinion because of the Toonami age, Toonami was a 2 hour block on cartoon network where they would show Anime of different sorts (action,mecha,romance,slice of life, etc).  that attracted many viewers to the anime genre and that's the beauty of anime, there are many genres to choose from like anime dealing sports, horror, romance, comedy, sci fi, you name it they probably have an anime for it.|`|YXOiH9QLaa	Yes, it is japanesse cartoon animation.

3VqRXc6yaa	The Wild Card show takes place on March 5 (according to my DVR settings) which is right after we vote for the final group of 12. So I guess the judges will either pick people to perform and then choose right away or all the people who don't make it will be invited back that night and the judges will just choose based on the past performances. I think it's weird. The show is only an hour so I'm going to assume no performances.|`|QmSIsUZvaa	after three people are chosen from each group randy simon and paula chose three singers that were eliminated that they feel are good enough to be in the top 12 and they are uneliminated and put in the top 12! so not all hope is lost for the ppl who were eliminated yesterday|`|aihogb26aa	The above answerer is mostly right, but the judges aren't just picking 3 people right away. There will be a wild card show in 3 weeks. The judges will invite singers back (a producer said 9 or 10) that they think deserve a 2nd chance. Then, after they perform again, the judges will choose 3 singers from the wild card show to round out the top 12.|`|0CsMa3T3aa	after america votes in 9 people for the top 12 in 2 weeks, as a group the judges will pick 3 people who did not make it to complete the top 12, which would be the wildcards

Look at the check, compare it to a valid check that you have on hand, and make sure that nothing is missing, in the American Idol logo (which I am assuming is on the check) or on the check.  If it does seem valid, however, try to cash it at the bank.|`|WJW4qOlUaa	I never heard of anything like that! BEWARE it may be a scam!|`|m7hipOmUaa	wow that is weird!<br>  what was the contest 4?
vYeS5mYnaa	paul simon 50 ways to leave your lover|`|SpcYCBndaa	10. No Doubt - "Ex-Girlfriend"<br>  Gwen Stefani and crew visit the "woulda-shoulda-coulda" mentality that often rears its ugly head when a relationship kicks the bucket. <br>  <br>  9. Jennifer Lopez - "Ain't It Funny"<br>  J.Lo shows her ex the door in this 2002 anthem. Nexxxxxt! <br>  <br>  8. The Ting Tings - "Shut Up and Let Me Go"<br>  We couldn't have said it better than the title, which is why we heart the Ting Tings. <br>  <br>  7. Kanye West - "Heartless"<br>  Kanye asks the same question on all our minds: "How could you be so heartless?" <br>  <br>  6. Carrie Underwood - "Before He Cheats"<br>  Channel all your anger through this 2007 breakup ballad. Just don't follow Carrie's lead by keying your ex's car or slashing his or her tires. Restraining orders aren't "sexy." <br>  <br>  5. Pink - "So What"<br>  Think of Pink as a burly high school football coach. In this song, she lyrically smacks your *** and tells you to get back in the game. <br>  <br>  4. Justin Timberlake - "Cry Me a River"<br>  Long rumored to be about his famous ex Britney Spears, Justin doesn't mince words: He's pissed and he wants revenge. And after her last few turbulent years, something tells us Brit did a lot of crying. <br>  <br>  3. Destiny's Child - "Survivor"<br>  Gather your strength and move on with the help of Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. You will get through this. <br>  <br>  2. Alanis Morissette - "You Oughta Know"<br>  Have they already forgotten about you and moved on? Alanis leaves a nasty reminder note in this ultimate breakup song. <br>  <br>  1. Kelly Clarkson - "Since U Been Gone"<br>  This "American Idol" alum tells<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ..............@@@~.............<br>  ................(o o)................      <br>  ==== ooO=(_)=Ooo=====<br>  <br>  Can I get ten points?<br>  Please<br>  Pretty Please<br>  Pretty Pretty Please<br>  Pretty Pretty Please with a cherry on the top<br>  You know you want to <br>  Go for it<br>  You can do it!<br>  -Thanks|`|RWEyZZXWaa	Runaway by Del Shannon.  #1 in 1961.

1ce8d52fda462710545502b546239252aa	Actually, the one with David Archuleta wasn't the latest one. There was one after that called iMeet Fred which guest starred Lucas Cruikshank (YouTube sensation) as Fred<br>  <br>  In the David Archuleta episode:<br>  Carly and Sam use the power of iCarly to help David Archuleta (the underdog on the show America Sings) get more votes. When David wins due to their show, the gang feels bad because they made Wade Collins lose. On TV, Wade Collins get America's sympathy due to a sob story about his "sick" mother. Since Carly feels bad about this, she invites Wade onto the show. Wade appears nice while they are filming iCarly, so Carly, Sam, and Freddie offer to shoot him a music video. However, after the show ends, the discover Wade's true arrogance. They end up shooting Wade's music video since they still feel bad about his mother. When Wade comes to pick up his video, he come with his mother, who is not sick at all, and he had just made up the whole thing. On the next iCarly, the gang invites David Archuleta on set in order to tell everyone how rude Wade is. Also they show a video of all of the mean things he said<br>  <br>  In the iMeet Fred with Lucas Cruikshank:<br>  Carly and Sam show SplashFace sensation Fred's videos on their iCarly. Then Freddie says that he doesn't think Fred is funny. Then on Fred's next video, he says that he is done making video's because Freddie insulted him. At school, everyone is mad at iCarly because they "killed" Fred. Fred invites iCarly up to his house in Shelby, Idaho to talk to them. He tells them that he was never made at them and that he just pretended to be in a fight to gain publicity for both of their websites. Then, Fred, Carly, Sam, Spencer and Freddie make a video together and air it on iCarly where Fred guest stars. Meanwhile, Spencer buys a Magic Meatball (like a Magic 8 Ball) Because he heard someone made a fortune off of it investing in the stock market. His meatball makes him do insane stuff like by an ostrich whom he names Marvin. When a man wants to feature Spencer's artwork in a museum, his magic meatball refuses to let him. The man sees him arguing with the meatball and then sees Marvin. He begins to think Spencer is crazy and he ultimately runs out of the loft<br>  <br>  That's pretty much it!

I though it was a Van Damme movie but I can't find it on  imdb.com.<br>  If the prisoners try to escape their heads blow up.<br>  I know for sure it is Not Logan's Run. I have seen it alot of times and I know that it is not the right one.

AA10262086	Don't stop learning the chords. Make it a goal to learn at least 2 or 3 new chords a week. Work on all the basic 3 and 4 chord progressions until you get comfortable switching chords. Now would also be a good time to start learning some scales. The major scale , minor scale and pentatonic blues scales are the most widely used so they would be a good place to start. After awhile you will begin to see how the scales correspond with the chord progressions and how music is made. It wouldn't hurt to begin learning some simple songs but don't let that get in the way of learning the guitar , if you know what I mean.

VVhphnUJaa	Bay apparently likes leaking a bunch of alternative storylines and cast lists around the internet.  I don't think it's possible to know until the movie comes out.<br>  <br>  I know for sure Jetfire and Ravage are going to be in it.<br>  <br>  I have a question though; one big negative point among TF fans is the decision to make Megatron a Cybertronian jet.  Go ahead and make him something other than a gun if you think mass-shifting is unrealistic (in a movie with giant space robots for some reason...), but an alien jet is just a sloppy shortcut.  Then we move on to Jetfire in the sequel, who was ALWAYS a Cybertronian jet since he never scanned an alternate Earth mode like the other TFs, but in the movie he's a Blackbird.  Why does HE have the Earth mode and Megatron doesn't, instead of the other way around like it's SUPPOSED to be? :S|`|0GFPxD8laa	[edit] Autobots<br>  Peter Cullen voices Autobot leader Optimus Prime.[57] He retains his alternate mode of a blue Peterbilt truck with red flame decals. Cullen recorded a voiceover for the opening scene in August 2008, but began the majority of voice work in November.[58][59] A live action cameo has been written for Cullen.[60] <br>  Mark Ryan voices Bumblebee, the Autobot who befriended Sam and disguised himself as his fifth-generation Chevrolet Camaro. Ryan also continues his role as stand-in for the robots on set.[61] <br>  Ironhide, the Autobot weapons specialist who transforms into a GMC Topkick. Jess Harnell voiced him in the first film. <br>  Ratchet, the Autobot medic who transforms into a search and rescue Hummer H2. Robert Foxworth voiced him in the first film. <br>  Arcee, an Autobot with a feminine personality and appearance, who can separate into three motorcycles with their own robot forms.[51] Arcee was dropped from the first film as the writers felt there was not enough time to explain her "gender", but she and several other female Transformers appeared in the first film's toy line and tie-in comics.[62] Orci stated the issue of gender could just be ignored in the film.[63] <br>  Mudflap and Skids, respectively a red Chevrolet Trax and green Chevrolet Beat.[64] Mudflap is very hyperactive, while Skids believes himself to be the smarter of the two and tries to come across as mature, but nevertheless appears unable to keep quiet.[65] Bay chose the Beat and Trax for the Autobot twins because he thought those two small cars looked good together.[66] According to leaked daily call sheets that Bay claimed he faked,[67] they begin the film by combining into an ice cream van.[68] Skids was mentioned by the other Autobots in the Transformers: The Reign of Starscream movie sequel comics. <br>  Sideswipe, a silver Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Concept.[64] <br>  Jolt, a blue Chevrolet Volt.[64] Jolt was a last-minute addition to the cast after General Motors, the film's car supplier, wanted to promote the Volt.[69] The writers had already wanted to include the car in the script before the Writers Guild strike, so they had to work out a character that would fit well within the Autobot team afterwards and convince Bay to approve the addition.[70] Hasbro previously used the name Jolt for a Decepticon in the first film's toy line. <br>  Jetfire, an SR-71 Blackbird. He was a Decepticon, but his wounds and age have made him choose to ally with Optimus.[2] He can combine with Optimus, an idea previously seen in the Transformers: Armada series.[71] <br>  Wheelie, a small radio-controlled truck. Wheelie initially serves the Decepticons because he is frightened of them.[72] <br>  <br>  [edit] Decepticons<br>  Megatron, the Decepticon leader. Killed and thrown into the Laurentian Abyss, he is resurrected as a Cybertronian tank.[73][74] He was voiced by Hugo Weaving in the first film. Bay told Empire that Megatron was not in the film, claiming his tank form was just a new toy.[4] <br>  Starscream the air commander which transforms into an F-22 Raptor. He flew into space at the end of the previous film, and now returns bearing Cybertronian symbols on his body and commanding a new Decepticon army.[75] Orci confirmed he will have more dialogue.[17] Charlie Adler voiced Starscream in the previous film. Chris Mowry, writer of the comic book prequels, stated Starscream differs from his 1980s incarnation because "His motivations are more for the species. He's definitely at odds with what Prime and Megatron have been doing. He thinks that they’ve both been consumed with greed, for their own selfish reasons, but as he finds out, his plans start to fall through as he’s kind of becoming overwhelmed with the same greed that they had."[76] However, Orci explained that during post-production, dialogue additions edged Starscream closer towards his 1980s counterpart.[77] <br>  Soundwave, Megatron's communications expert and his most loyal soldier.[2] He transforms into Cybertronian craft with jet and satellite capabilities.[75] The concept artists also designed an Earth form of a Chevrolet Silverado for him to upgrade into, which Orci stated was dropped.[78] In the 1980s toyline, Soundwave was a tape deck. The filmmakers had tried to work him into the first film twice, and these roles eventually evolved into Blackout (a MH-53 Pave Low helicopter) and Frenzy (who changed into a CD Player and later into a mobile phone). The latter character was particularly thought to be too different from the original.[79][80] Soundwave made his first appearance in the Transformers: Alliance prequel comic book series arriving on Mars then sending a large number of Decepticon protoform troops to Earth.[81] <br>  Ravage, a minion of Soundwave that resembles a one-eyed giant jaguar.[51] <br>  A puppet, with a body resembling Frenzy, a cat like face, dreadlocks, and a bird-like beak, was spotted on set.[82] <br>  Barricade, a Saleen S281 police car.[54] Jess Harnell voiced him in the first film. <br>  Scorponok, Blackout's for

kGCd8ioRaa	A legendary wrestling icon that revelutionized sports Entertainment. A larger than life hero who inspired an entire generation to become wrestling stars themselves. i.e. - John Cena and Edge to name a couple. Granted, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Undertaker, Shawn Michales and Tripple H have helped, but I believe Hogan is responsible for where sports entertainment is today. I follow TNA wrestling because I grew tired of the WWE storylines (except for the Undertaker) I think that it were not for Hulk Hogan there probably would not be TNA.

YRh29brWaa	Buddha would kick azz|`|eFnUBBxiaa	Odin, hands down. Jesus and Buddha would refuse to fight. Also, Jesus and the historical Buddha are flesh and blood, while Odin's oodles of untouchable deity energy. <br>  <br>  Of course, flesh and blood has its advantages. Odin is doomed to just be Odin for the rest of eternity (which means crushing all ensuing religious types). Maybe Odin wants to spend a summer slinging java for Starbucks and finding himself, but he can't. He's Odin. Jesus and Buddha contain the very human quality of betterment and choice. They both became something better after previously failed careers (carpentry and royalty). <br>  <br>  Still, Odin would squash 'em like bugs against a windshield.|`|AxkYUq56aa	Well, given how Odin is the only one prone to violence, and the other two are peace seekers who advocate love, it wouldn't exactly be a fair fight.

Ow3O7h4caa	Transits by themself mean nothing. but if the transits repeat aspects or go over sensitive points in progressed chart, then they will be felt but only if the natal chart promises or has the same aspects.<br>  <br>  Transits cannot promise what isn't in a natal chart. Period. If you have a well placed Jupiter in your natal chart for instance, and a transiting Jupiter afflicts your natal aspect, the good promised in the natal chart will not be removed or taken away.<br>  What will happen is that, what jupiter promises will be diminished somewhat but you will still get what is promised, or you may encounter some obstacle in getting what is announced. But eventually, you will still get benefits.<br>  <br>  And vice-versa, a badly aspected Jupiter in natal, will not produce any good if transiting Jupiter gives a good aspect to its natal position. What will happen is that the bad that Jupiter promises in the natal chart will be diminished but the bad will still occur.<br>  <br>  As for your Uranus square Moon, coming up, you need to see what house are involved. The house Uranus transits is the area where it will be felt. That transit will create tensions and suddenchanges in your personal and emotinal life. The little tension that you have suppressed over the last several years will surface and demand to be released in some way.<br>  Domestic life may be the source of upset now when the transit starts. Their may be accidents in the home, a sudden need for house repairs or other sudden problems. This is not a good transit if you need to buy a home and if forced tobuyahome or change residence, goahead but be very careful.<br>  Generally under this transit, you are seeking more emotional freedom at this time, If you can, change your existing relationships so that they embody  what you are looking for.  Otherwise, if you seek out new  relationships, your persona may be more disrupted than you want. Whatever you do, you will probably find that your wants and needs are not consistent with those of the people around you. Some may thing you are crazy ( not clinically insane ;-)) because of your actions at this time. <br>  But that period of instability will only be temporary, during which you will come to a new understanding of your emotional needs.<br>  <br>  Again, if you have this aspect in your natal chart, or an opposition or what between Uranus/Moon, then you will feel this aspect.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|y6wikiJDaa	Some transits feel more intense and recognizable on the surface, like a transiting planet opposite your Ascendant, for example. Other transits you might have to step back and look at your life from a little bit of a distance and use more of an "overall" perspective to feel the meaning. Check your transits regularly on www.astro.com (or whatever you use) and take note of how you're feeling. You'll start to recognize familiar feelings of transiting planets and certain aspects. For example, if you're feeling extremely angry one day and for no apparent reason, check your transits and see if you don't have something aggravating your Ascendant like Mars in Opposition. I definitely felt it when I had Mars Opposite my Ascendant. And I usually feel very good and confident when the Moon is in Leo.
M3Xmqlt8aa	Most people that have mastered any form of high magic sufficient to actually make a so called Love Spell work, realize that it is a very dangerous to do, Karma is involved and if this is done against someone that has better karma than the spell caster, the spell caster may find themselves foolishly and uncontrollably falling love with what may turn out to be a bitter enemy in the future. There are ways around this but few find them. People that have reached such high levels would never even consider trying to cause someone to fall in love (EROS) with them. Because it is a particular type of chemistry that leads to love and simply creating a decoy or imitation of that type of chemistry is very short lived. Even true practitioners desire real love. I am of the greatest certianty that there are so few people skilled enough to snare me in that type of spell that I never even think about it, I would say however I do not think Love spells are ever a smart idea except against a true and dangerous enemy, and it should never be attempted by anybody that has the slightest question about what they are doing and how to protect theirself. Love spells are not what they seem, and they are not nice.|`|c8HHi3Wqaa	I think not.  People need to learn to deal with rejection and continue with their lives.  Creating a potion to make some one love you isn't really love.  Love is a gift, not a demanded emotion.|`|UtzALxfjaa	its NOT a good idea. i mean like it's cute, to get someone to fall in love with you. but you're going to have to live with the fact that they don't 'willingly' love you.<br>  you MADE them love you. its horribleee.|`|pErky9MVaa	No. It's a bad idea. Doesn't say that your happy. Happiness is about love know?|`|frxEgBaxaa	There are plenty of love spells out there that do not effect some one elses free will.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	It's not.<br>  Be careful what you wish for!|`|AA11370204	A "Love Spell" is NOT a very good idea!

Maybe he stuck around a little longer and made you do the bad thing twice.|`|9Duha1k4aa	Erm ... it was the cat.|`|haN9IMbCaa	Well the answer is quite simple. The person who made me do it the second time, was a man i met long ago. His name is is Muhamad. But before i talk about this, we must learn the history of Muhamad.<br>  <br>  He is the founder of the religion of Islam and is regarded by Muslims as a messenger and prophet of God (Arabic: ????? Allāh), the last and the greatest law-bearer in a series of prophets. Muslims consider him the restorer of the uncorrupted original monotheistic faith (islām) of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and other prophets. He was also active as a diplomat, merchant, philosopher, orator, legislator, reformer, military general, and, according to Muslim belief, an agent of divine action.Born in 570 CE in the Arabian city of Mecca, he was orphaned at a young age and brought up under the care of his uncle Abu Talib. He later worked mostly as a merchant, as well as a shepherd, and was first married by age 25. Discontented with life in Mecca, he retreated to a cave in the surrounding mountains for meditation and reflection. According to Islamic beliefs it was here, at age 40, in the month of Ramadan, where he received his first revelation from God. Three years after this event Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly, proclaiming that "God is One", that complete "surrender" to Him (lit. islām) is the only way (dīn) acceptable to God, and that he himself was a prophet and messenger of God, in the same vein as other Islamic prophets. Muhammad gained few followers early on, and was met with hostility from some Meccan tribes; he and his followers were treated harshly. To escape persecution Muhammad and his followers migrated to Medina (then known as Yathrib) in the year 622 CE. This event, the Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar. In Medina, Muhammad united the conflicting tribes, and after eight years of fighting with the Meccan tribes, his followers, who by then had grown to ten thousand, conquered Mecca without bloodshed. In 632 a few months after returning to Medina from his Farewell pilgrimage, Muhammad fell ill and died. By the time of his death most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam and he united the tribes of Arabia into a single Muslim religious polity.<br>  <br>  Now then we were talking and stuff, and he was like hey go do it again. I chuckled, and i was like why. Then he was like because you must. It is your destiny. Then i was like <br>  fo sho|`|IKCfT9tnaa	hormones!|`|y9GsC7ogaa	The devils sister....she's pretty hot.|`|3FFAIMpLaa	Just checking to see if I remembered how to do it on my own.|`|JNQezEGqaa	Me, myself and I.....<br>  Peace.|`|ahXIBlstaa	the devil again|`|Mgg5vcdOaa	I'm a fast learner.

OLcXtWQyaa	it would be great if there was one language everyone knew. but not at the expense of any other language. i love linguistics, but can't learn languages. every language has it's unique characteristics which are just amazing. ideally, everyone would know at least one language from every linguistic family. the more languages one understands the more insight one has into the way different people think. eg. my father dreamed in Finnish and thought in that language when he was 'in the past', thought in German when he was building or whatever, in English when he was thinking of everyday stuff.|`|QXZiJo0Uaa	It would be cool if everybody knew one language, but only if they kept their own language also.

Poop fetish sounds extreme but a foot fetish is pretty common 80% of people who have a fetish its usually feet and it doesn't mean there going to go crazy and eat your toe nails it just means they find it attractive when a girl has nice pretty pedicured feet. Personally i like when a girl takes good care of her feet and the rest of her body,But i also been with girls who hate feet and had pretty messed up feet,A wise woman always told me a girl who doesn't take care of her feet most likely doesn't take care of her vagina.. ew|`|AA12383000	Did you watch on Springer A few years ago? there was A man and<br>  Women that had this food fetish were they took A bath in baked beans.|`|58eHufb3aa	1. the weirdest one i've heard of was the one u just said, to be honest.<br>  <br>  2. i dunt have a foot fetish|`|NQU7VoR2aa	1. The whole pull hair thing would probably be one of the weird things to me, not in a bad way, simply because its one thats new to me, anything involving pain aint my thing, but thats just me.<br>  <br>  2. You might as well ask WHY does anyone like anything? We all have tastes and interests and preferences that differ from the next person, whether it be food, music, hobbies, sexual etc. Try asking yourself, WHY do you like the things that you like? whats the appeal?  <br>  <br>  You most likley will aswer that they either, feel good, taste good, or are enjoyable to you personally. with feet and everything else, its the same thing, some people like the taste, some people like the smell, some people just like to feel them or be felt up by them because its a good feeling to them. In short, people are different, meaning different things will feel good to them than the next person.<br>  <br>  If you still then 'get' it at this point then its because you are not suppose to get something that your not even into yourself. Its merely accepting that there are things that you like that others dont and vice versa, thats it. <br>  <br>  When we learn simply to accept differences rather than try to and 'get' them, we are less likley to end up like the following.|`|ozCn1feYaa	1..no fetish is weird to me .jajaja..<br>  2. i never got why feet are sexy..i never will|`|rC7YIughaa	my guy friend like loovves feet too!im like wtf??who would love feet?|`|I1K6SC43aa	1.

Bill said they are trying new things with his voice also so who knows how it will sound.<br>  <br>  I think they will be a bit of everything, which is what they wanted. They wanted a mix of everything, trying a bit of everything. There WILL be songs very Tokio Hotel-sounding, but then some that will catch the listener off-guard.<br>  <br>  This is from THA...<br>  <br>  '    Hamburg (ap) The new album by “Tokio Hotel” is expected to be on the market at the end of May or the beginning of June. “If Bill doesn’t come with more song ideas, then we`ll finish the album-production hopefully in the next six weeks”, producer David Jost said to the news-agency AP. Actually the song-writing was finished: “But now Bill and Tom have written two new songs last week”<br>  <br>      Singer Bill Kaulitz and his twin-brother Tom have recorded their own demos of the songs in their little home-studio in their apartement in Berlin and sent them then to Los Angeles, where the album is mixed at present.<br>  <br>      “As the band traveled so much in the last three years and lived out of a suitcase, they are happy about every day, they can spend at home in Germany”, the manager of the Kaulitz-brothers said, who became famous with the song “Durch den Monsun” and rank now at one of the most successful German rockbands.<br>  <br>      So the songs were reworked in a three hour video-conference, and Bill have sung them in a studio in Hamburg. Via ISDN they were recorded then in Los Angeles, Jost explained.'<br>  <br>  <br>  A recent post on Tokio Hotel’s MySpace page linking fans to an update about the album on MTV Buzzworthy also includes a message to look for more information about Tokio Hotel’s upcoming single soon! So, I’m going to make a prediction that we’ll see the single in March. I’m so excited! Are you?|`|kAIXDVu1aa	- it's not this month <br>  - it's gonna be out in late May or early June i can't wait !!!! :) <br>  - yess their sound is different , their doing ''Dark Anthems ''and they said they want to try out new music and their woking with other artists <br>  - i think it's gonna be both styles of music becuz their trying out new stuff <br>  <br>  HOPE I HELPED ...

lNucas6Daa	I have an interesting answer.<br>  <br>  I'm gay, and at some point, I want to become a father.<br>  A few years ago, my best friend, "Rachel" (not her real name) asked me to donate sperm to her so she could have a baby.  She was going to do it through IVF.  Rachel would have custody of the child, and I would have visitation rights.<br>  The problem for me was that Rachel was morbidly obese.  Morbidly.  She's 5'5" and weighed well over 350 lbs.  Both of her parents were also morbidly obese, and both died young due to their weight issues.  I love Rachel, and I'd love to give her the gift of a child, but I won't do it.  Her weight is my concern - how can you be a fit parent when your life revolves around food, and you're already unhealthy and having health issues due to your weight?   And through genetics, my offspring with her would have an increased risk of obesity and health issues due to their increased weight.<br>  I'm sorry, but as a gay man, I have an advantage over straights, I get to choose the best candidate for my sperm, and its not going to be an obese person.<br>  Rachel has since had gastric bypass and is now below 200 lbs, but I still won't have a baby with her because she's still has the mindset of a "fat person", even if her body is thinner.  And our children would still be genetically predisposed to being obese.<br>  <br>  Should obese people be allowed to adopt?  Yes, but only if they lose the majority of their weight, and are carefully watched to see that they do not regain the weight, and do not teach the adopted child unhealthy eating habits.|`|7RUqEJzLaa	Why not? Obese people have the same rights? Just cause they're fat doesn't mean they can't adopt :S Not all obese people can control themselves, they made themselves that way, sure, but it is probably hard to go back, it's not like they're going to feed their children bad food everyday.|`|st2zmU88aa	As long as they're still fuctioning, can provide the child with a good home and is able to take care of them yeah why not?<br>  <br>  because people don't approve of how they look they shouldn't be able to adopt what kinda bullsh.!t is that? People need to mind their own buisness really|`|4MJEWCjiaa	I don't think it should be the only factor for refusing them to adopt, but it could be considered, along with lots of other info.|`|BhQSTvLsaa	Well sure. <br>  <br>  Think about it: A pregnant obese woman...<br>  <br>  .......Freaking nasty sh*t.|`|Oa4QZGXSaa	thats rude|`|TZO9eZfHaa	why not?|`|eZCCSMykaa	jesus they need to go on a diet or just be a little fat or somethion|`|fEhN2GJbaa	Yes their fat love is as big as their fat hearts.|`|3oIcUB8Faa	Of course they should be allowed to adopt, they are human beings too. They have the same rights and freedoms that we do.|`|440fe6d001fab4a74217d83f7ee67715aa	What the hell kind of question is that? It's like asking should people with yellow toenails be allowed to adopt or not.|`|105ca1b5fd36799c805fe608b3fbce95aa	if they are capable of loving, caring and providing for that child, i dont see why not.|`|d4c9a4d52a9e77de4545721ac937c02faa	O_o|`|y7lUgd3aaa	I think they should be allowed too.  An obese parent is better than no parent in my opinion.  However, the child's diet should be carefully monitored by social services to make sure it is being taken care of.  The parents also should be healthy enough to play with the child and meet its needs.|`|jSl5HgbPaa	no way|`|eZURLkXfaa	yes cos they are people!! just because they are obese it doent mean they arent nice people<br>  <br>  but on the other hand if it was someone who is like 30stone then maybe they should have to loose a bit of wieght otherwise they would have major health conditions, and i think that goes againt the application for adoption|`|iWLaHVbfaa	for...it's not like they eat kids|`|52pZj3WFaa	The definition of obese is 3 stone over your ideal weight. At 5ft, I am then obese at 9 stone 11 pounds. Check that out. 9st11. Hardly rolling down the road, am I?<br>  <br>  I think age, lifestyle, etc should be considered. Perhaps more important is education, finances and the reason why they want to.|`|AA10230930	Anyone should be able to adopt as long as the can be proven to be loving parents.  Size, colour, sexuality etc, shouldn't make any difference, if the child is going to be in a stable loving home.|`|JOAPnhOgaa	100% yes<br>  thin people can have hidden illnesses (not visible as obesity) but they dont have to have a full health check before they adopt!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  TO FORMERLY KNOWN AS JENNIFER JETTER I AM OBESE AND I WAS PREGNANT AND IT WAS CUTE AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT<br>  <br>  PEOPLE LIKE YOU MAKE ME SICK<br>  <br>  SUCK ON THAT<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ,|`|iXpQdp45aa	yeah <br>  only because they are bigger than others doesnt effect their person inside personality. Some people were born that way to as it may run in their family genes so it can not be helped.<br>  <br>  its like saying can a small person adopt <br>  or a tall person <br>  they are still humans!|`|un1Ltnvdaa	No, because of their eating habits will be passed on. Increasing health costs. <br>  <br>  They cannot move to New Zealand either. An obese couple hoped to move their and was denied because of the extra health costs involved.|`|2s9IZU7xaa	there is nothing wrong wiht obese people they are the same as us thin people just a little larger so YES they are and should be aloud 2 addopt a child cause they dont have anything wrong with them unless they are mental I say yup|`|zguyd25qaa	ha<br>  interesting<br>  <br>  because if they can, then what's your argument towards homosexuals or drug addicts adopting children<br>  <br>  <br>  I get it<br>  but I won't answer :p|`|j2VDYbeoaa	The octuplet mom story overshadowed this other story, most likely. I had not heard of it myself.|`|v2CrzXj2aa	My mother is "obese" and I turned out just fine (aka not "obese").|`|iA5kZv15aa	Every child needs a loving home.  That is more important I think and whether the parents are fat or not doesn't matter|`|Ecx8SQM3aa	What does your weight have to do with something like that?|`|CTwlEvNvaa	Sure, thier human aren't they? So why not?|`|Ql6qFk85aa	Why not?|`|hgMarQVtaa	sure why not|`|Zcz8cXVRaa	sure why not?|`|Kv3GqU9Zaa	i think they should b able to, some ppl have higher metaboliam than others and some have low<br>  i eat all sorts of crap and im skinny still and another person cud eat all the crap but put it on a lot <br>  so yeh they shuld be able to adopt|`|kgFayakraa	I'M OBESE AND LESBIAN AND I'VE ADOPTED SO SUCK ON THAT|`|ZKVGoP9Iaa	sure if gay poeple can adopt so can obese poeple do you think they'll be a bad influence if the kids are already skinny then they shouldnt have much to worry about|`|SFDCB2Xsaa	Why shouldn't they? That's discrimination.

SC7sxZDMaa	Contacts. I wore glasses from age 5 until 16, when I simply stopped wearing them - not because my vision improved, but because I hated them. They just seemed like a major social barrier. I was able to compensate until I was 31 and I eventually started wearing contacts.|`|m8kF5U84aa	I don't wear neither but my sister does she does not like to though she thinks ugly in them but I think she looks cute. what I have heard from contacts it is good i don't think it would be bad so you should probably get them. but it is just my opinion. hope i helped|`|9EjzebnFaa	I've had both before.

I turned 18 in high school and still had no job (which I completely regret at this point in my life, a job would've benefited someone of my age greatly). I also got diagnosed with epilepsy, so I had no car. I lived in a small town and though we had a little party, it felt no different to me. I had been doing things for years on my own. <br>  <br>  I didn't smoke. So the thrill of buying cigarettes on my own didn't apply to me. 18 just made me legal. Not until I turned 21 could I drink - and even that holds no special meaning to me. <br>  <br>  I'm pretty jaded.<br>  <br>  ;-)|`|cdpy5iv5aa	I finally got out of juvenile Jail|`|5c5e9767db0aa6f5bac57f3e406b4092aa	so i can buy lottery and porn!|`|bTLwhwR3aa	...im about to turn 17!!!!!!!!|`|VJZMMeZJaa	Because I didn't have to ask my friends to buy cigarette's for me anymore.

I looked around and realized someone had left their child outside, locked in their car.  It was 35 degrees outside and much colder with the wind blowing.  <br>  I thought for a moment, do I walk away and mind my own business?  But what if the child freezes to death, or is kidnapped, I could never forgive myself.  I stood around for 10 minutes waiting to see if a parent or guardian would appear.  But no one came by.  So, I wrote down the license plate and was about to call the police, when the mother came out of a house nearby.  I asked her if the child was hers, and she said, "Whats it to you?"  And I said, "You can't leave a baby outside in the freezing cold, ALONE, for such a long time."  And she said, "I was only inside for a minute, and you need to mind your own f---ing business!"  And I said, "I noticed the child crying over 10 minutes ago, God only knows how long you were in the house before I came along, its child endangerment, you can't do that."

RavvDVpVaa	Stans of any entertainer will overrate them, and Nas stans are no different. I co-sign with Aim on this one, I don't think anyone has a problem with Nas himself, it's just the stans that send you hate mail if you don't think he's god. There's been uses on here who've said and I quote "it's blasphemy to compare Nas to _______ or to say Nas is _______", if you use Nas and blasphemy in the same sentence than something is wrong with you.<br>  <br>  I feel like if I've gone out and spent my hard earned cash, I have every right to be completely honest and call it how I see it, if it's wack it's wack, if it's dope, it's dope. This is how I'd rate his albums<br>  <br>  Illmatic -Classic 5/5<br>  It Was Written -Great 90/100<br>  I Am- Wack (besides the premo tracks) 50/100<br>  Nastradamus- Wack (besides the premo track) 45/100<br>  Stillmatic- Good 80/10<br>  Lost Tapes - Great 90/100<br>  God's Son- Good 80/10<br>  Streets Disciple- Ok 70/10 (he should have made it into 1 album)<br>  Hip-Hop Is dead- Good 80/100<br>  Untitled- Borderline Wack 60/100|`|bribxhsdaa	Because this section is 70% raw unadulterated idiot. - That Blaq talon dude being a great example. Idk if you've ever heard me call Immortal Technique "Hip Hop's barbershop Genius" As in he's only smart by comparison to stupidity, I wouldn't go as far as to put NaS in that bracket, But based on the depression of intelligent content in mainstream hip hop, The second NaS says anything remotely knowledgable, Everyone is like "OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH SNAP. NaS is the truth. BLA BLA BLA".<br>  <br>  In most cases, It's because Illmatic is the album that EVERYONE has heard and can throw greatness over without having heard it...And when most people ACTUALLY hear it...They figure. "Wow..I'm stupid. This is definitely a classic but I think I exaggerated a bit".."yeah..NaS is overrated." <br>  <br>  Plus NaS and Premier (Don't even get me started on that subject) are interchangable..So every gaffot who's had NY State Of Mind as their ringtone recently will put his pedestal up even higher. <br>  <br>  I still like NaS as he was the first rapper I got into when I started listening to hip hop..But there are bags of MC's that could eat him alive and whilst that doesn't make him any worse an MC, It just shows people need to relax on the overrating..<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, His discography is one of the best but I'd be lying if I didn't say, For such a smart MC - The wicked levels of stupidity his fans seem to exhibit didn't make me view him negatively at times.<br>  <br>  Same with Jay-Z, Lil Wayne and a large amount of MC's from the south.<br>  <br>  Ever wondered why Mc's like Common, J-Live, Black Thought & Co. aren't given any stick? <br>  <br>  Fans with two braincells to rub together.|`|9JECmPjmaa	For some odd reason people don't like to admit how great Nas is.  Nas said himself "I'm a man's man/a rapper's rapper" so certain people (other artist and people in the musc biz) identify with Nas and realize his greatness.  Other people listen to him and may get lost in the message because they are not equipped to fully understand it.  You have to know his whole catalog to really understand him.  I am  a artist, I think of myself as pretty talented, Nas humbles me.  Hip-Hop is flooded with gimmicks and fads and the people who follow these fads are the ones who don't understand Nas' message and don't understand why people hold him in such high regard.  They compare people to Nas as so to say "Everybody think Nas is so hot but he ain't hotter than so and so" they want to see if you think Nas is better than their favorite artist.  In most cases he IS better, more than most. Nas is not in face he is in your mind, its a huge difference.<br>  <br>  Nas is the greatest rapper of this era.  Not the richest, not the loudest, not the flashiest, just the greatest.|`|lMOXHh45aa	I dont think I'm one of the complainers, but from what I've seen alot of times another rapper's credentials will get knocked by an album or somethin Nas did... when Nas had nothin to do with the sh*ts.

Wi0LBsVbaa	It's awkward to say classical influenced today's music. Today's music is built on yesterday's music as today's technology is built on yesterday's. <br>  Yesterdays classical composers were the pop musicians of their time. Women used to treat Franz Liszt the same way they treated Elvis or Usher.<br>  Each era chooses from the earlier ones, that which they find useful. In the 60s the Moody Blues used an orchestra, the Beatles and the Stones used classical instruments. The seventies found classical pieces done to disco, and Jimi Page using tunings that would have inspired Paganini, also bands like Yes and ELP, which used actual classical performers, straddled the line between classical and pop. (the bass player for the Grateful Dead, Phil Lesh, started as a classical composer who hung out with Elliot Carter).<br>  Unfortunately for music, MTV came along, and people became more into the image presented, than the music performed. Oddly enough, Van Halen is an exception, Eddie had classical exposure when he was growing up, which influenced his virtuoso style. The production of guitar harmonics on stopped strings (as opposed to open) came from cello technique.<br>  The development of harmonic resources and instrumental technique has been progressing through time. But the forms of music used today, have been around for hundreds of years. The creation of a melody over a repeating bass, common to metal, and hip hop, goes back to dance forms used in popular music, where the beginning is lost to history. Known as basso ostinato, passacaglia, or chaccone (technically a chaccone is based on a repreated chord progression, like "Johhny Be Good is" or your average rock jam, but the bass can be repeated) it provided music for Iron Butterfly, P-Funk, and all dance music from 1963 onwards.<br>  The song form, which has a middle section or chorus, comes out of folk music and was the standard by Mozart's time. Having contrasting sections allows for longer less monotonus songs.<br>  Much harmony today comes from jazz, not classical, but then again George Gershwin is both. As I said at the beginning of this mountain of blabber, today people choose what they can use from the past. <br>  Here I do not mean to be disrespectful, but I need to point out that most of what is considered classical-specific, is used in pieces longer than todays music, and requires a longer attention span. The stuff used today (past 25 years) is more influenced by the popular folk music forms and harmonic idioms through history. <br>  (The Beatles did do one song "You Know My Name, Look Up the Number" that is a variation form and is a classical form, "Wipping Post" or "Mountain Jam" -Allman Brothers, are fantasies on a theme. Some Grateful Dead, such as "Scarlet Begonias into Fire on the Mountain" incorporate a set of variations on a theme, followed by a transition section, followed by a chaconne, which entirely proper in following classical forms. These pieces are all too long for airplay and video format so the style has been largly discarded in favor of the short forms of today's music).<br>  PS; all apologies for any spelling errors, the check ain't happening right now.|`|CrAwmz65aa	In a sense, Beethoven forebode rock-and-roll music 200 yers early. In many of his piano sonatas, he contrasts a less smooth first theme with a steady and legato second theme. In the first movement of the f minor sonata, op. 2 no. 1, the second theme starts at ms. 20. In the first movement of the A major sonata, op. 2 no. 2, the second theme starts at ms. 59. In the fourth movement of the C major sonata, op. 2 no. 3, the second theme starts at ms. 30. In the first movement of the "Little Pathetique" Sonata, op. 10 no. 1, the second theme starts at ms. 56. In the first movement of the D major sonata, op. 10 no. 3, the second theme starts at ms. 23. In the first movement of the "Pastorale" sonata in D major, op. 28, the second theme starts at ms. 76. In the first movement of the g minor sonata, op. 49 no. 1, the second theme starts at ms. 16. In the second movement of the same sonata, the second theme starts at ms. 20. <br>  <br>  The Queen hit song "We are the Champions" follows Beethoven's example, with the stanza replacing the first theme and the refrain replacing the second theme.  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sogKUx_q7ig" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sogKUx_q7...</a><br>  Notice the difference at about 0:34.<br>  <br>  In the "Love Boat" series, the signature theme, with its steady legato accompaniment, begins when the ship leaves the port.<br>  <br>  The Beatles also followed Beethoven's example.<br>  Listen to "When I'm 64":  <br>  <a href="http://www.links2love.com/love_lyrics_125.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.links2love.com/love_lyrics_12...</a><br>  Scroll down to the bottom of the page.<br>  You will see the legato theme starting at about 0:39.<br>  <br>  Also listen to "Girl":<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYl0iMSlMQg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYl0iMSlM...</a><br>  Here, the legato theme starts at about 1:01.|`|ca64f074806522d41931e7a2676ce936aa	I think you need to refine your question. Do you mean to refer to strictly classical music, i.e. that written (roughly) between 1750 and 1820ish. And the influence of that period on 'concert' (for want of a better expression) music being written today? Or do you mean 'classical music' in its whole gamut from Alfonso the Wise to Bernard Zimmermann on the popular music of today?|`|yYAabiSLaa	Namely in structure. The laws of tonal harmony are the building blocks on which most all popular music today is built. I don;t even know where to begin...

0tngRdmNaa	I totally was thinking the same thing about Ben's injuries as you. I have a feeling that he was going to try and kill Penny, but Desmond stopped him and beat him up. I started to think this because of the payphone he was calling from near the marina, and because he was also soaking wet when he called. However, Desmond does not know that anyone is trying to kill Penny (I think), and does Ben even know that Penny is Desmond's wife? He probably found out some how. I have a feeling that these things will be explained in next week's episode, because I think it will be an explanatory episode where they explain the things that led up to this point, and in the gaps.|`|JxUFDutxaa	For some reason as soon as I saw him all bloodied..I thought:<br>  "Hurley beat him up"<br>  Not sure why..but I'm sticking with that guess for now.|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	Who knows, but he deserved the beating
