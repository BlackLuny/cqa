zorYTX59aa	For some weird reason, YouTube's announcement system<br>  of new messages sometimes reverts back to the last time <br>  that people checked their messages.<br>  <br>  Have you noticed that the numbers which YouTube claims <br>  are your "new messages" are in fact the same number as <br>  the last time when you "opened" your previous messages?<br>  <br>  The same problem seems to be occurring to many people <br>  who receive notices about the number of "new subscribers"<br>  they supposedly have. My guess is it's a temporary glitch.<br>  <br>  One thing you could try and do is clear all of your cookies, <br>  history and temporary internet files.

pDxFOekIaa	You need to pay for extended warranty<br>  <br>  I just bought an Asus N10Jc for my daughter for school. Great little pc<br>  it has 1 gig ram with XP costs A$1000. Another model N10J has 2 gig ram with vista costs $1200.<br>  <br>  It has a NVIDIA? GeForce? 9300M GS with 512MB VRAM so it can handle games.<br>  <br>  Always work out what your needs are and buy a laptop to suit.<br>  Choosing a laptop<br>  =============<br>  Laptops are excellent for running a second screen.<br>  So please consider this<br>  Two screens are a lot of fun.  Assignment on one, internet, research on the other.  Game on one, messenger on other.<br>  <br>  I suggest to buy the laptop to suit your travelling needs, and have a second 19 inch screen at main base to plug into.<br>  If you moving the laptop every day, so that you plugging into the main base every day, I suggest to set up a docking station complete with usb mouse and usb keyboard, and of course the second screen.<br>  The docking station sets the laptop at a 45 degree angle so its keyboard is 45 degrees and you hinge open the lid so its vertical.<br>  If you have 19 inch on its own stand, then the top of the laptop is the same height as the top of the 19 inch..<br>  <br>  Now you can buy the second screen and docking station later on, and the docking station is not really necessary for home use, but for office use its best practice, so ensure you get a brand that has this available, if you think you need it..<br>  <br>  If you walking a lot eg college, then gives you the opportunity to buy a light weight small screen type that's easy to carry<br>  <br>  <br>  You have to decide on weight and battery criteria.<br>  <br>  1. Weight - If you are going to carry it to and fro to school/office then consider getting a lightweight model.  An external CD drive may be an option as if you not into burning disks or watching DVD then you hardly use the CD drive.  Something about less than 2 kg is a lightweight.  Anything over 2 kg is very heavy to carry.<br>  <br>  2. Battery Life, -  if you never going to use it on batteries then you can go bigger processor and larger screen.  You can consider not buying the battery if appropriate.  You can have two power supplies; one at home and one in the office is good for large heavy laptops.<br>  If you want to use the laptop on batteries then you may have to choose a smaller processor and a smaller screen so you can get the hours required out of the battery.  <br>  <br>  3. Minimum specifications –<br>  Games will require more specifications – more ram and –more video card specs – more processor power.<br>  Generally though:<br>  -a decent video card (for projection of power point presentations)<br>  -Wireless networking<br>  -Ethernet<br>  -Consider a high speed hard drive<br>  - Consider 120GB Hard drive or larger <br>  - Consider an external DVD drive or an Internal Burner -depending on your needs<br>  -Consider 1 Gig RAM for XP or 2 Gig RAM for Vista, double that for Games or autocad type software<br>  -Software able to update from their websites<br>  -Internet security and<br>  -Antispyware (free from net) is a must for internet use.<br>  -Easy accessible USB ports<br>  - built in webcam /mic<br>  - A Mouse - wireless mouse are a pain, get a small usb mouse.<br>  - a keystone lock<br>  -A carry bag.  Sometimes the manufacturer’s bag is the best buy<br>  <br>  Consider getting the hard drive partitioned to C: and D:  The C drive can be 30 gig for a laptop  D drive is extended across the remaining. <br>  <br>  Good buying:  I suggest to buy from a discount store that can offer extended warranty, which you may pay for.  If you do this make sure all the ram is in so it is covered by the warranty. Extended warranty will cover it for 3 years, and a lot of laptops do go wrong.  The store should do the following<br>  1. add the ram<br>  2. install the software<br>  3  partition the hdd<br>  4  Ensure the hdd is NTFS file system

q6oY6HvXaa	A web accelerator is a proxy server that reduces web site access times. They can be a self-contained hardware appliance or installable software.<br>  <br>  <br>  Techniques<br>  Web accelerators may use several techniques to achieve this reduction:<br>  ? They may cache recently or frequently accessed documents so they may be sent to the client with less latency or at a faster transfer rate than the remote server could. <br>  ? They may freshen objects in the cache ensuring that frequently accessed content is readily available for display. <br>  ? They may preemptively resolve hostnames present in a document (HTML or Javascript) in order to reduce latency. <br>  ? They may prefetch documents that are likely to be accessed in the near future. <br>  ? They may compress documents to a smaller size, for example by reducing the quality of images or by sending only what's changed since the document was last requested. <br>  ? They may optimize the code from certain documents (such as HTML or Javascript). <br>  ? They may filter out ads and other undesirable objects so they are not sent to the client at all. <br>  ? They may maintain persistent TCP connections between the client and the proxy server. <br>  <br>  <br>  Location<br>  <br>  Web accelerators may be installed on the client (browsing) computer / mobile device or on ISP hosted servers or both. Accelerating delivery through compression requires some type of host based server to collect, compress and then deliver content to a client computer.<br>  <br>  Client-Server<br>  <br>  There may be two sections to the proxy as well - a server portion sits in front of the Web server and captures the input and output from the server and a client portion sits in front of the end-users Web Browser to capture the input and output from the browser.<br>  <br>  Client Side<br>  <br>  As of July 2006, these applications generally serve to improve dial-up, broadband and other connections from which users may not be getting the best speed. Many users can achieve a 2- to 10-times speed increase in average browsing experience, while some report a 5- to 20-times speed increases for specific web sites and pages. Many ISPs offer web accelerators as a part of their dial up and broadband services. Web accelerators are typically designed for web browsing and, sometimes, for e-mailing and can not improve speeds of streaming, gaming, P2P downloads or many other Internet applications.<br>  <br>  Server Side<br>  <br>  Other web accelerators are targeted at the web site or web application owners. This type of web accelerator is installed in front of web servers and application servers and use a variety of the above techniques to improve performance to all users accessing the accelerated web sites or web applications. Sometimes referred to as a Reverse proxy.<br>  These type of server side accelerators has the added benefit of off-loading transactions and connection managements from the web or applications servers and hence, reducing its CPU utilisation and increasing web server or application scalability to handle more users with less bandwidth.<br>  <br>  Most Popular<br>  <br>  Since there are so many different PC configurations, it is impossible for any one web accelerator to be the best as an application of its purpose. It is even possible for a web accelerator to slow down and clog up a connection.<br>  <br>  Comparison<br>  <br>  It is essential when selecting a web accelerator product that you take time to find the most suitable accelerator based on your needs and system setup. Not all accelerators will run on all operating systems and some may be optimised for a specific browser configuration.<br>  It is important to check which internet connections the web accelerator is designed to work with. In some cases selecting the wrong product will reduce your internet connection speed dramatically|`|TTsVhHq4aa	help web pages show up in a snap

q6oY6HvXaa	A CPU cache is a cache used by the central processing unit of a computer to reduce the average time to access memory. The cache is a smaller, faster memory which stores copies of the data from the most frequently used main memory locations. As long as most memory accesses are to cached memory locations, the average latency of memory accesses will be closer to the cache latency than to the latency of main memory.<br>  When the processor needs to read from or write to a location in main memory, it first checks whether a copy of that data is in the cache. If so, the processor immediately reads from or writes to the cache, which is much faster than reading from or writing to main memory.<br>  The diagram on the right shows two memories. Each location in each memory has a datum (a cache line), which in different designs ranges in size from 8 to 512 bytes. The size of the cache line is usually larger than the size of the usual access requested by a CPU instruction, which ranges from 1 to 16 bytes. Each location in each memory also has an index, which is a unique number used to refer to that location. The index for a location in main memory is called an address. Each location in the cache has a tag that contains the index of the datum in main memory that has been cached. In a CPU's data cache these entries are called cache lines or cache blocks.<br>  Most modern desktop and server CPUs have at least three independent caches: an instruction cache to speed up executable instruction fetch, a data cache to speed up data fetch and store, and a translation lookaside buffer used to speed up virtual-to-physical address translation for both executable instructions and data<br>  <br>  <br>  Details of operation<br>  When the processor needs to read or write a location in main memory, it first checks whether that memory location is in the cache. This is accomplished by comparing the address of the memory location to all tags in the cache that might contain that address. If the processor finds that the memory location is in the cache, we say that a cache hit has occurred, otherwise we speak of a cache miss. In the case of a cache hit, the processor immediately reads or writes the data in the cache line. The proportion of accesses that result in a cache hit is known as the hit rate, and is a measure of the effectiveness of the cache.<br>  In the case of a cache miss, most caches allocate a new entry, which comprises the tag just missed and a copy of the data from memory. The reference can then be applied to the new entry just as in the case of a hit. Misses are comparatively slow because they require the data to be transferred from main memory. This transfer incurs a delay since main memory is much slower than cache memory, and also incurs the overhead for recording the new data in the cache before it is delivered to the processor.<br>  In order to make room for the new entry on a cache miss, the cache generally has to evict one of the existing entries. The heuristic that it uses to choose the entry to evict is called the replacement policy. The fundamental problem with any replacement policy is that it must predict which existing cache entry is least likely to be used in the future. Predicting the future is difficult, especially for hardware caches that use simple rules amenable to implementation in circuitry, so there are a variety of replacement policies to choose from and no perfect way to decide among them. One popular replacement policy, LRU, replaces the least recently used entry.<br>  When data is written to the cache, it must at some point be written to main memory as well. The timing of this write is controlled by what is known as the write policy. In a write-through cache, every write to the cache causes a write to main memory. Alternatively, in a write-back or copy-back cache, writes are not immediately mirrored to memory. Instead, the cache tracks which locations have been written over (these locations are marked dirty). The data in these locations are written back to main memory when that data is evicted from the cache. For this reason, a miss in a write-back cache will often require two memory accesses to service: one to first write the dirty location to memory and then another to read the new location from memory.<br>  There are intermediate policies as well. The cache may be write-through, but the writes may be held in a store data queue temporarily, usually so that multiple stores can be processed together (which can reduce bus turnarounds and so improve bus utilization).<br>  The data in main memory being cached may be changed by other entities, in which case the copy in the cache may become out-of-date or stale. Alternatively, when the CPU updates the data in the cache, copies of data in other caches will become stale. Communication protocols between the cache managers which keep the data consistent are known as cache coherence protocols.<br>  The time taken to fetch a datum from memory (read latency) matters because a CPU will often run out of things to do|`|zBimIAzaaa	In a really basic way CPU cache is extremely fast memory that the CPU uses as temporary place to store code and data.|`|A2ZWKTiMaa	CPU cache is simply a cache used solely by the CPU for storing processed information. It's basically a high speed memory within the processor. In common cases, more cache usually means better performance. There are 3 possible levels of cache (L1, L2, & L3) L1 being the smallest and the fastest to be read by the CPU, L3 being the slowest of the three since it checks by the CPU last. Intel's popular Core 2 Duo make sure of L1 & L2 cache while their latest Core i7 consists of L3 cache as well.<br>  <br>  gl

TvaZqyf4aa	avast! Virus Cleaner is a tool that will remove selected viruses from your computer. While avast! itself is able to detect and delete almost all known viruses, avast! Virus Cleaner can handle only a small selection of the most common ones. The list can be displayed (in the avast! Virus Cleaner tool) by clicking on the "About" button.<br>  <br>  avast! Virus Cleaner is built directly into the avast! Antivirus. If you need, however, it is also possible to download a stand-alone version of the avast! Virus Cleaner from the ALWIL Software web pages - for free. Both the versions (the downloadable one and the one integrated into avast! Antivirus) are the same.<br>  <br>  If avast! detects a virus that is possible to remove using the avast! Virus Cleaner, it will show a special button to start the tool. The button (labeled "Completely remove the virus from the system") will be placed directly in the virus warning window - right above the buttons to delete, rename or move the infected file. When the option to start the avast! Virus Cleaner is available, it is recommended you use it!<br>  <br>  Advantages<br>  <br>  avast! Virus Cleaner is a tool to completely disinfect your system. It repairs the infected files (whenever it is possible) and deletes the virus bodies, so that it is not necessary to reinstall your system or recover it from backups. But it does more! It also removes virus items from the system registry (which is very important in some cases), fixes corrupted configuration files, and deletes temporary files created by the virus (such files do not contain any virus code, so they are not detected by avast! itself - but they occupy space on your hard disk). In short, avast! Virus Cleaner removes every possible trace of the virus from your system. There is no need to perform the cleaning in the Safe Mode - when a virus is found in memory, it is deactivated first.|`|fizuyKBTaa	I recommend Registry Easy.|`|cKSbZBt8aa	There are many available.

A2ZWKTiMaa	I have been using Cyberpower's 1500VA (900W) on my tower it houses 1000W PSU + Q9550 Quad Core (OC) + ATi 4850 + 2 HDD + DVD + 22" LCD and it lasted for about 18 - 21 min, this system usually takes about 255-290w during non-gaming sessions and >300w when playing. so there. 700w pc you mention, do you mean 700w PSU? if so that doesn't mean your pc draws 700w. anyways most pc i come in contact with don't ever go over 400w so i think even 1100-1200 VA would be more than enough for your pc. <br>  <br>  btw, my Cyberpower UPS has a display that tells me how much power components are drawing from it (hints my knowledge on the numbers :)<br>  <br>  gl|`|K8L35vqZaa	You know what is a funny word?

9bb2f26a6d8dc8a9031ac642baed3f02aa	You need to be more specific...Did you take the movies off the ipod and put them on your computer?? If so they're more than likely in apples format and your computer cannot read it. Or they're copy protected. It doesn't seem like a virus problem to me.|`|440b5eeaa808017d23fb3beb1ec4fa73aa	I'm a little confused over the series of events.<br>  <br>  When did you catch your brother looking at porn on your computer and when did you do the virus scan? I'm only asking, because if all this took place prior to you hooking up the iPod, then it helps eliminate that as a possibility as a cause of the problem. The only way it can still be a possibility is if you haven't been keeping your system up to date with all the security patches, you also need to have a good anti-virus software and you need to keep it up to date too.<br>  <br>  If you are confident about the above and not having a virus at that point, then the question come if/how/why did virus infected files get pass your anti-virus software during the copy from the iPod to your computer. Normally, one would expect their anti-virus software to catch something like that during a file read/write and either give you some kind of notification or just deal with the problem depending on how you have the software setup.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I would say I'm very suspicious about the iPod, your friend's computer being safe from viruses and your computer being protected, too. The reason I say this is assuming that your brother was viewing the porn before your tried loading the stuff from the iPod he would have left you with your computer in it's current state, so you never would have even gotten a chance to try and load the iPod stuff right. After all, if he picked up a virus before your got to your computer and he may or may not have been using the media player too, you never would have been able to load the iPod stuff.<br>  <br>  So, how do you fix the problem! First, you can start by turning off the computer and then turning it back on for a cold-boot and start pressing the F8 key as soon as the computer starts to boot up. Then, select "safe mode". After Windows finishes loading open Windows Explorer and go and delete all the files you copied onto your system from the iPod. Close the Windows Explorer and then clean up all your Internet files. Then, when you are done make sure you empty the trash can if it will let you. Once you have finished you can re-boot and hopefully everything will be ok.  If it is ok, it means you either had a cross-linked file or a low grade virus. Either way you should probably look at doing something about your virus protection.<br>  <br>  If it didn't fix the problem, then you probably need to buy a anti-virus software package and use it to scan your system or take your system in to get it looked at.<br>  <br>  By the way, if it turns out you did pick up a virus from the iPod, then it might be infected since they don't have any anti-virus protection on them at all and they do have memory that can be written to other than the 30g of space.<br>  <br>  I never rely on what others say they have when it comes to protection on their system, because I have seen a software application developer lose all of his date on his PC and his network drives by making one stupid mistake, when it came to his anti-virus software. I have also seen real world examples in a corporate environment what happens, when files are shared without good virus protection.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|MMToc0IGaa	I doubt the apparent virus on your computer is linked to your ipod. I'm not sure if you mean your computer needs to close as soon as you start it or that itunes needs to reboot as soon as you open it.<br>  If its the first one, try doing a virus scan, with several different scanners.<br>  if its the latter, reinstall Itunes.|`|UVmt6KiTaa	Virus? yes it could be.<br>  But before that, what happen if you play another movie (from CD or another file)?

Be sure to scan with Norton as I believe is the best scanner out there at the moment. <br>  <br>  2.) Make sure your movies and songs are from Itunes. Songs that were bought from itunes are transferable to different PCs. But movies are not. In order to view to movies on your pc, you need the ID and password that you used to buy the movie from itunes or else itunes would not let you view the movies at all.<br>  <br>  3.) Make sure the Ipod firmware is updated with your pc <br>  <br>  Note: If you know when your brother started using the PC for porn, you can just restore your PC to a earlier date and update all applications (itunes, windows...) then you should be fine.|`|pDxFOekIaa	Fat file system crashes on large folder files.  folders that have over 2 gig in them can cause trouble.<br>  <br>  do this with confidence, to both your hard drive and the 30 gig ipod.<br>  <br>  Your computer needs to be NTFS to see the large hdd, and to use files larger than 2 gig.

Just go to Help > About and you can find out what version product you have.  <br>  <br>  As mentioned, Internet Explorer 7 is what comes with Vista.  You can download Internet Explorer 8.0.6001.18372 RC (release candidate) 1 here: <br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/Internet-explorer/beta/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/Interne...</a><br>  <br>  It's been in public beta testing for almost 2 years, so it is somewhat dated.  Generally, release candidates are pretty reliable.  The likeliness of experiencing a glitch on a release candidate is relatively low, especially after a product that has undergone a long public beta testing period.  Ever since beta 2 back in summer '08, it runs slightly smoother than IE7 and the accelerators are cool.  <br>  <br>  The final version of Internet Explorer 8 is expected to be released in Q2 (around springtime) in 2009.

Don't worry; it's really hard to completely uninstall Internet Explorer and it can screw up your computer if you successfully do that.  Uninstalling it through the expected UI will NOT uninstall Internet Explorer completely, but it will switch it back to the latest version of IE on your computer.  <br>  <br>  Control Panel > Programs > Uninstall Programs > Internet Explorer 8 > Follow Uninstaller Wizard > Restart|`|opdtWmzzaa	In IE 7, far to the right, beyond Options, is a double-arrow.

My friends alway ask me to fix their crazy IE.<br>  But, I tell them IE is not good to use. IE is unstable, error prone, and insecure.<br>  U may often see IE crash like <a href="http://0rz.tw/024jV" rel="nofollow">http://0rz.tw/024jV</a><br>  <br>  U should try Firefox. Firefox is a web browser that is basically like Internet Explorer, but it runs 127% faster (you see the pages quicker) and also has a built in spell checker!<br>  <br>  Firefox is an open source project, so many enthusiastic programmers trace the source code every day.

nkV5kLF5aa	Your problem is either the Processor, since it is 64 bit, or your Hard Disks.  I don't think Windows 98 supports SATA, and I doubt you'll find drivers for it anymore.|`|9OrDVWdeaa	You should make sure that your system can handle it. Did that computer ever have a different operating system? If so, if it was a smaller version like I said earlier it may not be able to handle it. If it hasn't then it probably wasn't made for that big of a system.|`|R3Li1hbKaa	I think you will be able to install windows 98 on your computer but the problem would be the driver softwares of your hardwares Windows 98 will not recognize them you will be having hard time finding them.|`|TbEwkoQDaa	I don't think there's a problem with your hardware and chipsets.  The problem there is the File System format of your disk.  Windows 98 only runs to FAT format.  Here's what you gonna do, reformat your hard disk with DOS files and run the setup with Windows 98.

OVTVQHejaa	If your business is online stay away from satellite. It is expensive, and a real pain with the bandwidth restriction. (Bandwidth is like, say a thick tube that so much data can go through with satellite. They think its "fair" amt. of usage should be limited so everytime you go over, they penalize you) If you need satellite (if your in a rural area, no other Internet Service is around) go with HughesNet. They're just as much as a pain but you are only penalized 24 hours for going over in one day. If you can get DSL do so. I used satellite and as a kid knowing a lot about computers, it really sucks. Don't upgrade. It'll only be more expensive. Plus, satellite is slow compared to DSL in my opinion. If you're stuck in a contract, well, sorry but either terminate it and pay the hefty fee, or stick with it. Also uploading does use bandwidth. <br>  <br>  Oh and if you stick with satellite try downloading "NetworkX" I used it while I was with HughesNet to tell me how much bandwidth I was using. Good Luck|`|AA11248883	Never heard of wild blue, but i am in Western Australia and use westnet which is very good. The only time i got put on DSL shaping was when i was uploading heaps of movies and it means you have used your monthly limit.You will go back to full speed when the new month starts but it seems like something is not right unless you only have a very limited download which depends on how much you pay for.<br>  Heres a few questions being thrown around on a forum about Dsl shaping which may give you a better idea.|`|Vx9Lvt9Aaa	yeaa it seems like it cant carry that much ......sound like you need to change or upgrade so u can use as much banwidth as you like.....|`|JgM0Dwfraa	did u get my e mail<br>  im gettin lonely<br>  o yeah internet is the reason hubba hubba is out of style<br>  <br>  you can join my club to make hubba hubba an American thing again<br>  !!!

BJCMouVmaa	Hey there!<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, most ISP's can track most internet traffic that goes through them, except for encrypted traffic like emails and forms. This is how anti-piracy groups know who is pirating illegal software. If you use an anonymiser software or route your traffic through a proxy, then chances are you're safe!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|Ns6I7MmBaa	They do have a log of your IP address in case they receive any complaints about what you are doing knowingly or unknowingly (worm, virus, etc.).  But it would usually take a court order for anyone else to get details.<br>  <br>  What else they track or probe depends upon their terms of service (TOS). Your account could be terminated if they or anyone else has evidence that you violated their TOS.|`|sYxUVBvPaa	Not really, ISPs don't literally look at everything you do but it is all recorded in a log that you can request from them if you want to find out that kind of thing.

Control Panel - Administrative Tools - Computer Management.  When you see your drive displayed, right click on it and select Shrink.  That will reduce the size of your current sole partition and give you a second one.  The second one has to be formatted and then made into a Simple Volume.  However, the frustrating part is Microsoft's rule - earliest OS goes on first - XP before Vista.  You and I both want the same result.  If you just put the XP on the new partition, the dual boot won't work because you already have the newer OS (Vista) on your computer.<br>  My HDD is partitioned in half but I've put Windows 7 on the new partition because I couldn't get the dual boot to work when I put XP on|`|AenRh1eRaa	partion your hd into 3 parts. 1 for vista, 1 for xp, and one for just storing data.|`|oyr13KYmaa	Works like a charm:|`|l8TGolvVaa	when you are looking for free help you might find you get some better responses if you tend to not get testy<br>  bare in mind you get what you pay for....oh  wait this help is free........get it :)|`|juyJY3Lraa	instad of one boost put 2?
vO9fPCm2aa	PC :~)|`|tIDNEwdMaa	A list of common lies and misinformation and plain old stupidity against the Macintosh platform:<br>  <br>  1) Macs are more expensive than PC's<br>    a) Macs have a useful life about twice that of PC's.   A Mac user will be replacing his computer half as often as a PC user.  Do the math.  Macs are cheaper than PC's.<br>    b) How many times have you bought a PC with the idea of going somewhere to buy the hardware necessary to upgrade it?  The only thing I add when I bring a new Mac home is memory, which I get cheaper from someone other than Apple.  Do the math.  Macs are cheaper than PC's.<br>  <br>  2) "Everyone" uses Windows.<br>    a) Gee.  Isn't that nice.<br>    b) If "Everyone" uses Windows, why are we having this conversation?<br>    c) Just because it is "popular" does nor mean it is a good thing.  Hula Hoops, pet rocks, Tomakachi, etc were all popular at one time.  Popular does have a long standing and is not a standard by which to judge the usefulness of a product.<br>  <br>  3) Windows is better for gaming than Macs.<br>    a) True, but if the people who keep saying this truly stood by the logic of what is the better system from games, they would instead say something like, "don't listen to those idiots who say Macs suck at games.  Get yourself a game console like PS2 or Xbox.  A game console is better at games than Windows."  But they aren't saying that are they?  What good is their advice is they can't stand by it themselves?<br>  <br>  4) There isn't enough software for the Mac.<br>  a) With the exception of games (read #3), there is no type of software application available for Windows that is not available for the Mac.  While you may not find a Macintosh version of an application made by the same company for some products, you will still find selects for the same task.<br>  b) Volume?  Yes, there is a large number of selections for Windows than for the Mac, but walk down the aisle and see how much of that selection is crap and/or outdated (and discounted) software.  Take that software out of the pictures and the gap narrows considerably.<br>  <br>  5) There isn't enough hardware for the Mac.<br>  a) Like the software misinformation, hardware selection for the Mac is lesser in number, but not as it is for software.  Hardware is not OS specific.  It is driver controlled.  A couple weeks of coded and testing will create a driver for the Mac OS.  Most companies are willing to take the time and expense of doing this.  Based on my experience, it is the crap hardware that usually does not have Mac drivers.  This is because the manufacturer knows that crap hardware does not have a future among Mac users.  We won't buy it.<br>  <br>  6) Macs are gay!<br>  a) This is so sophomoric, it's hard t respond to.  Why take advice from someone who would think this is an intelligent argument?  'nuff said.<br>  <br>  7) Software written for Windows will not run on a Mac.<br>  a) Software written the Mac will no run in Windows.  I guess by this logic, you can't buy a computer at all.<br>  b) Well, not exactly.  While there is no [legal] way to run the Mac OS in Windows, you can use Boot Camp or Parallels to run Windows on a Mac, which means you can run Windows software on a Mac.  But this is not a good reason to get a Mac, as getting away from Windows is one of the reasons to use a Mac.<br>  <br>  8) Windows 7 is coming out soon and will be better than Vista.<br>  a) Windows 7 is essentially an improved version of Vista.  Microsoft decided to remove the Vista name plate to increase sales.  If it doesn't say Vista, then it isn't Vista.  Buyers will think it is better.<br>  b) Only Windows ME was worse than what it replaced.  While Windows 7 is likely to be better than Vista.  This does not mean that it will be better than Mac OS.  This argument compares Windows to Windows, not Windows to the Mac.  What value does this argument have?<br>  <br>  9) Mac are for multimedia.<br>  a) Yes, there are.<br>  b) Macs are for web browsing, video editing, photo editing, audio editing, word processing, blogging, email, home work, writing, research, and everything else you might want to do with a home computer.<br>  <br>  10) Macs are for idiots.<br>  a) Let me translate:  "Macs are easier to use than PC's, so that must be designed for stupid people, right?"  Tom Hanks, Stephen Speilberg, Buss Aldin, Martha Stewart, the late Bris Yelsin, Malcom Forbes, Jr, Richard Dawkins, Tom Clancy, Scott Adams, Trent Reznor, The Rolling Stones, Bono, Conan O'Brien, Jerry Seinfeld, Rush Limbaugh, Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood, and Tim Allen, must all be idiots.  But I'm sure that anyone can compile a list of smart people who use Windows.  The intelligence of the user is not correlated with their choice of computer.  This argument is either driven by the low intelligence of the person saying it, or but "sure grapes".<br>  <br>  11) You can't upgrade a Mac.<br>  a) I have no idea where this lie comes from.  Yes, you can upgrade a Mac.  Thing is, why would you need to upgrade your Mac?  With the possible exception of Memory, the Mac come fully loaded.  And for most people, the Mac comes with enough Memor|`|1cdsJ3lpaa	Last time I checked a MAC was a Personal Computer.<br>  <br>  I like DIY projects so chalk up another one for a non-mac PC.|`|XlyLakYAaa	Definitely a PC.|`|gBPP0HEuaa	I could be a mac...lets see how to be a mac.

co4MjPZeaa	First, you'll want to add lines to cout your childtickets and adulttickets to make sure the numbers are getting entered correctly.  You might also consider changing your variables to adultTickets and childTickets to help yourself out, but it's not necessary.<br>  <br>  The big question is, which 3 lines printed...ie, can you post your results in an edit?<br>  <br>  **edit**<br>  Thanks.  Although it might be tedious, perhaps make two new variables tempAdultTicks and tempChildTicks and code:<br>  tempAdultTicks = adultTicks*6;<br>  tempChildTicks= childTicks*3;<br>  grossTicks = temptAdultTicks + tempChildTicks;<br>  <br>  You might also want to do a cout << "Got here 1" ; before your gross statement and another "2" after your gross statement...because even if you don't get an answer, it should technically still cout your starting statement, "The gross boxoffice profit is...".  So, something maybe happening with the code syntax when you calculate your gross to not allow the program to get any further, but also apparently not create an error.

TvaZqyf4aa	try avast! it has a virus cleaner too. avast! Virus Cleaner is a tool that will remove selected viruses from your computer. While avast! itself is able to detect and delete almost all known viruses, avast! Virus Cleaner can handle only a small selection of the most common ones. The list can be displayed (in the avast! Virus Cleaner tool) by clicking on the "About" button.<br>  <br>  avast! Virus Cleaner is built directly into the avast! Antivirus. If you need, however, it is also possible to download a stand-alone version of the avast! Virus Cleaner from the ALWIL Software web pages - for free. Both the versions (the downloadable one and the one integrated into avast! Antivirus) are the same.<br>  <br>  If avast! detects a virus that is possible to remove using the avast! Virus Cleaner, it will show a special button to start the tool. The button (labeled "Completely remove the virus from the system") will be placed directly in the virus warning window - right above the buttons to delete, rename or move the infected file. When the option to start the avast! Virus Cleaner is available, it is recommended you use it!<br>  <br>  Advantages<br>  <br>  avast! Virus Cleaner is a tool to completely disinfect your system. It repairs the infected files (whenever it is possible) and deletes the virus bodies, so that it is not necessary to reinstall your system or recover it from backups. But it does more! It also removes virus items from the system registry (which is very important in some cases), fixes corrupted configuration files, and deletes temporary files created by the virus (such files do not contain any virus code, so they are not detected by avast! itself - but they occupy space on your hard disk). In short, avast! Virus Cleaner removes every possible trace of the virus from your system. There is no need to perform the cleaning in the Safe Mode - when a virus is found in memory, it is deactivated first.|`|fizuyKBTaa	I guess it's a rogue anti-virus.<br>  No enough info:(<br>  Since it's a virus,and u can't uninstall it like a program.<br>  Check Spyware Cease.<br>  Maybe it can help u:)|`|cKSbZBt8aa	Download Spybot, install it, run it.

Zecp1ui1aa	I believe the problem may be with the file size. Fat32 has a 4GB(less 2 bytes) file size limit and also FAT32 does not have fault tolerance for files. The larger the file the more reading & conversion has to be done. FAT loves small files & partitions.<br>  <br>  You are not very clear whether you have 3 separate hard drives with Logical partitions or 1 or 2 hard drives with extended partitions. The math doesn't quite add up.<br>   <br>  Here a few things to try:<br>  1)First run an error check on that partition. I don't know what OS your running but windows has a program/service that can check for errors.<br>  <br>  2)Try to move the file to a separate NTFS hard drive.<br>  <br>  3)Use a program like win zip and split the file into smaller chunks. like 10 or 25Mb each.<br>     a)Have win zip save them to the NTFS partition OR<br>     b)burn/save them to a disk and move them off to the NTFS partition<br>  <br>  4) Use a file backup program to burn & split it for you to multiple CD's or a DVD.<br>  <br>  4)If all else fails & you have windows XP you can convert the FAT partition to NTFS. <br>  <br>  Last unless you absolutely need it GIT RID OF YOUR FAT32.<br>  If your running 2k or XP your just doing yourself a disfavor by running FAT. NTFS is better & faster as well as easier to recover.

AA10645979	As has been said by other answerers, VoIP is a technology by which you can make phone calls by using the internet.<br>  <br>  In layman's language without much geek talk, let me tell you that when you make a phone call using your computer your call is sent via the internet instead of the the cables which are used by the traditional phone line.<br>  <br>  So in essence VoIP is a technology which carries your voice to the other person by internet and brings back that person's answer to you in the same way. <br>  <br>  You can use VoIP to make calls basically in three ways.<br>  <br>  Pc (personal computer) to other pc. <br>  Pc to a landline phone<br>  Phone to phone. (Here the phone is a special phone which is like your landline phone but is connected to the internet.)<br>  <br>  While it is not possible to cover everything about VoIP in a short answer or a long article even, let me mention one noteworthy thing  about VoIP technology - it is highly cost effective compared to traditional phone lines.<br>  <br>  You can make totally free calls to anybody in the world by using pc to pc calls.Other modes (pc to phone or phone to phone) are not free but they cost a fraction of what you would pay if you used the traditional landline or mobile phones.<br>  <br>  Besides this there are other features which are not available with landline phone system though of course there are some drawbacks to VoIP also as can be expected with any technology.|`|HNLcHb65aa	Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a general term for a family of transmission technologies for delivery of voice communications over IP networks such as the Internet or other packet-switched networks. Other terms frequently encountered and synonymous with VoIP are IP telephony, Internet telephony, voice over broadband (VoBB), broadband telephony, and broadband phone.<br>  <br>  VoIP systems usually interface with the traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN) to allow for transparent phone communications worldwide[1].<br>  <br>  VoIP systems employ session control protocols to control the set-up and tear-down of calls as well as audio codecs which encode speech allowing transmission over an IP network as digital audio via an audio stream. Codec use is varied between different implementations of VoIP (and often a range of codecs are used); some implementations rely on narrowband and compressed speech, while others support high fidelity stereo codecs.|`|XlyLakYAaa	It's Voice over IP (IP being the internet).

rl530Za9aa	The reason you are experiencing this problem is because your computers display drivers automatically turn off dual monitor mode if it doesn't detect another visual device connected to the computer. <br>  When your computer shifts back to single monitor mode, it resets your theme to accomodate for this. It does this on purpose so if by chance you had icons on the 2nd device, they aren't lost off-screen when you are back to a single monitor.<br>  <br>    Depending on your video card, you can enter the graphics settings for the card, usually by right-clicking on the desktop, and search for the options for multiple monitors. Once you have found these settings, look for an option to Force Detection of your 2nd device. Using this option will make the computer think that the TV is never unplugged and it will not reset any theme settings when you disconnect and reconnect the device.<br>  <br>    Be warned though, using this setting means that when you have only one viewing device plugged in, you cannot see any icons, windows, or anything that is native to the 2nd viewing device.|`|xGkew2y3aa	only PC or laptops that have the dual softwear can work.... the reason the xbox is showing 2 on the screens is because it dosent know you want to display as a dual insted you get two of the same screen...  i think theres a option in the xbox system settings if not you may need HDMI cables for your xbox

RKZyCuESaa	Yes, hacking the school's network, which is something you really don't want to do because besides getting banned from access to your school's computer you could probably get some jail time.<br>  <br>  If you want additional access to something from your school computer, the best thing you could do is contacting the school's network administrator. Besides, if it's blocked, it's either a mistake or because they don't want you using it from their network for a reason. Installing programs on a school computer is probably against your school's rules so I wouldn't do that either.
lb0bYSgUaa	Yes...<br>  <br>  In order to successfully remove malware infections (viruses, spyware, adware etc) from your PC you need to follow a methodical approach as well as using effective (and free) tools.  There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.

Bittorrent is bad as well. Utorrent is what I have now and I've never had problems with it. Although if you are looking for music, I suggest visiting a streaming site (ie- youtube, veoh, or dailymotion) and then copy the url and send it to someplace like zamzar.com and convert it to a mp3 type file. <br>  <br>  Otherwise try these places for music: <a href="http://vroosh.com/mp3_search.html" rel="nofollow">http://vroosh.com/mp3_search.html</a><br>  or <a href="http://www.dogpile.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogpile.com/</a> or airmp3.net or even download <br>  <a href="http://01-mp3search.com" rel="nofollow">http://01-mp3search.com</a>|`|sYxUVBvPaa	no such thing. Stop downloading illegal files and you will be safe. file sharing programs can not be regulated because they are P2P and therefore can not be guaranteed not to have viruses and actually most of them are. Just pay for your stuff and you will not have problems.<br>  <br>  Beyond that, I believe limewire to be the best. Just make sure you scan your files before using them with an antivirus/antispyware program and you should close to eliminate your risk for getting a virus but its not 100%, sadly, nothing out there really is.|`|nkV5kLF5aa	If you know how to use it, I would say uTorrent is the best.  Provided you only use it to download legal, non-copyrighted materials, you should have absolutely no problem with viruses or spyware.  Also, check the comments/reviews of the thing you are going to download.  Usually, if it has a problem with it, someone would tell you so.|`|FpUPEJZyaa	<small>well my boyfriend has a MAC and he uses limewire and I know he has a firewall up against limewire but he is still able to downlaod.

However, since the author wants you to also be able to calculate the approximate time between two dates, I'm guessing that they don't want you to use this approach. I think they want you to write your own "Calendar" object and use it to calculate time. You're going to need more information, specifically how many days in each month during an approximate year? If you assumed 30 days per month (including February) in an approximate year, that would equal 360 days.

DtV8OLOoaa	An IP address is a logical address used to communicate with devices on a separate networks (an example 192.168.0.1)<br>  A MAC address is hardcoded on the network device and this enable network devices within the same network segment to communicate with each other (example of mac address 00-18-D3-32-56-46)|`|Cfw0OvLwaa	IP address is a numeric identifier assigned to each machine on an IP network. It designates the specific location of a device on the network. <br>  <br>  An IP address is a software address, not a hardware address—the latter is hard-coded on a network interface card (NIC) and used for finding hosts on a local network.<br>  <br>  IP addressing was designed to allow hosts on one network to communicate with a host on a different network regardless of the type of LANs the hosts are participating in.<br>  <br>  A host’s MAC address is based on a 12-digit hexadecimal address. <br>  Usually, but not always, the MAC address is burned in the NIC through the use of a Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM) module, or the address can be burned into a special chip called an electronic PROM (EPROM). <br>  The MAC address is identified in the second layer of the seven-layer OSI model.<br>  <br>  So different between IP address and mac address is IP address is a logical address ( layer 3 of OSI layer), mac address is a hardware address (phisical address, layer 2 of OSI layer).<br>  <br>  You can changed the IP address but you can't do the same with mac address.<br>  <br>  For more information about IP Address and Mac address please visit this link:<br>  <a href="http://yosellin.blogspot.com/2009/01/most-interesting-subject-ip-ver4.html" rel="nofollow">http://yosellin.blogspot.com/2009/01/mos...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://yosellin.blogspot.com/2009/02/mac-addressing-basics.html" rel="nofollow">http://yosellin.blogspot.com/2009/02/mac...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <a href="http://yosellin.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://yosellin.blogspot.com/</a>|`|WPT3C7MAaa	an IP address is your logical address when you are on a network ( Lan or Internet).

rHqe7oMoaa	Close any Youtube pages and empty your cache and history.|`|zorYTX59aa	If your YouTube is getting bombarded with "JavaScript" and <br>  "Flash Player" messages, and people are telling you to get<br>  or install something, DON'T TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  You will get absolutely nowhere messing around with "Java", <br>  "Flash" or different web browsers -- and definitely avoid any<br>  software that sales-pimps (disguised as answerers here on <br>  Yahoo) are trying to "sucker" you into buying.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you, because your computer <br>  and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right? <br>  The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:<br>  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add, <br>  change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.<br>  <br>  I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"<br>  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really<br>  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer<br>  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a <br>  lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why <br>  in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54<br>  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good <br>  for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).<br>  <br>  Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the<br>  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of<br>  their own servers every single day without warning anybody, <br>  in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions, <br>  it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or <br>  "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.<br>  <br>  If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing <br>  you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages, <br>  it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely<br>  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being<br>  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay <br>  there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer <br>  much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of <br>  them. The solution to that is to first exit YouTube, and then <br>  clear your "cache" of all its "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" <br>  and "history". Then reboot.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something<br>  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts <br>  my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on<br>  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever. <br>  (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are <br>  really disguised sales-people and peddlers. Their "answers" <br>  have nothing to do with your problem, and their wares may<br>  worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of selfish answer <br>  is that? [my paraphrase] "Although you cannot even watch <br>  or access videos, buy our downloader."<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").|`|owxFbRnNaa	you need to  re-install the  flash (the correct way).<br>  <br>  .. make sure all the browsers are NOT running during installation...<br>  <br>  OR..<br>  <br>  2.

Once you have created the remote installation file, you can email it to the victom in a zip file.<br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  At this time, I would also like to warn the people, that these Keyloggers/Spywares like softwares are really harmful things for you PC and your Privacy.<br>  So always use a good Antin-Virus and Anti-Spyware software, and also don't forget to update them at least once in every 15 days.<br>  <br>  Although I myself have used this kind of stuff in the past, but my usage was (harmless) just to fool some freinds, but now a days these softwares are being used for very bad purposes, so don't risk at it.<br>  <br>  Always use a good Antin-Virus and Anti-Spyware software, and also don't forget to update them at least once in every 15 days.

Which to me is the most effective way to secure data.<br>  <br>  Conversely, you can use the built in Microsoft Word's password utility. Here is an excerpt from the help file of Microsoft Word:<br>  <br>  "Require a password to open or modify a file<br>  When you create a password, write it down and keep it in a secure place. If you lose the password, you cannot open or gain access to the password-protected document. <br>  <br>  Open the file. <br>  On the Tools menu, click Options, and then click Security. <br>  <br>  ...Create a password to open<br>  <br>  In the Password to open box, type a password, and then click OK. <br>  In the Reenter password to open box, type the password again, and then click OK."<br>  <br>  Hopefully this answers your question.

354a65436692d1b5300ec606377b18d8aa	The easiest method to incorporating music and video in a blog is to use external sites to do the heavy lifting for you.  I would suggest setting up accounts at www.YouTube.com or www.Stickam.com.  Either site will allow you to upload video.  Stickam allows uploading of audio as well.<br>  <br>  The upload process is fairly straightforward with you only needing to follow on screen instructions.<br>  <br>  Both sites provide you with two options for including the media in other pages.  You can either use a URL or an EMBED element or tag to make use of this information.  The URL will allow you to include a link in your blog.  Users will be able to click on the link and view the video or hear the music on the site you are storing it on.  With the EMBED element, you simply need to copy the code provided by You Tube or Stickam into your blog where you want the video or audio to play from.  Users will have full control on your page of this media.|`|4be4e9c9ef8c813bdf007999fc3adaf8aa	you tube,google videos etc give that thing,These are called APIs

AA11299045	Ok, here's a few things you can do. First and foremost go download the drivers for it, this will most likely resolve the issue, if it dosen't try this; Go to my computer and right click on the cd drive, then go to the recording tab and make sure "enable recording" is checked. Next, go to your start menu and right click my computuer, choose Manage. A new window pops up. First, go to services (Under the services and applications heading) and find the listing titled IMAPI CD BURNING Service, (they're all alphabatized.) Right click that and choose properties, if it's not already, set the startup type to automatic. Now close that and go to the Device manager under the Computer managment heading (up top) We're looking for IDE ATI/ATAPI controllers. Click on the plus sign to expand that and look for the Primary IDE channel. Right click and choose properties. Under the Advanced settings tab make sure the transfer mode is set to DMA if available. (whew) almost done. Now restart and see if this did any good, if not. This is the last resort, go to start>run and type in regedit. Now go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE>SYSTEM> Current Control Set>Control>Class> {4D36E966-E325-11CE, etc etc. it may also be in {4D36E967-E325. What you are looking for are the Upper and Lower filters. So highlight that folder and look to the box on the right, if you see upper or lower filers, right click and delete them, then restart the computer. It will probobly tell you on restart that new hardware was found and you need to restart for the HW to work properly so do so. If this dosen't work then there is probobly something wrong with your hardware and you need to call tech support and have them send you a new one. It's not as daunting as it looks. Good luck.

AVG constantly checks your Temporary Internet Files folder for any viruses so if you visit a page that downloads a virus, AVG will detect it most of the times. If you are afraid of phishing scam sites install Firefox with Google Toolbar (don't use IE7 it gives too many false positives). Also install SpywareBlaster for ActiveX protection and installing SpywareGuard is also a good idea.

VlN50Vd7aa	The Dell XPS 1210, which  is a very cool computer. I have one.<br>  <br>  It weighs only 4 pounds and has bult in microphone and webcam. The microphone allows you to talk to friends without additional devices attached to your ears. Very convenient. The webcam allows you to view yourself live to your grandparents and other relatives, and also allows you o take pictures just like a digital camera. <br>  <br>  What makes this particular notebook interesting is that it allows you to listen to music and watch Movies without booting up windows. This means you don't have to turn on the notebook in order to listen to your favorite songs and Movies. Just a click of the direct media button will launch a special feature to benefit this convenience.<br>  <br>  The Notebook also features a set of keyboard called " Silence" This specific keyboard is only found on Dell computers, particularly the XPS series. <br>  <br>  The reason this little notebook has won best notebook of the year is because it is the only ultra portable notebook that dominates in gaming. That's right, it supports a powerful Graphic card to play the most intense game out there today.<br>  <br>  This will allow you to play games without having to worry about freezes and crashes.<br>  <br>  Please note that this notebook's buttons have blue lights combined. This means the notebook looks resplendent in darkness. <br>  <br>  It supports the most powerful CPU. The Intel Core 2 Duo processor offers up to two times the CPU performance on gaming and entertainment systems compared to Pentium M processor technology1 and up to 12% overall system performance improvement over first generation Intel Core Duo processor platforms2. <br>  <br>  I own one of these notebooks, and I can't be anymore impressed. I love it dearly to my heart.<br>  <br>  The notebook comes stardard with 1GB of RAM as well.<br>  <br>  If you like this notebook, which costs only $1299, then visit Dell.com instead of buying it from Ebay. Ebay is not a trusted site.  I have lost many money on Ebay<br>  You have a great day.

The link is <a href="http://geocities.yahoo.com/">http://geocities.yahoo.com/</a> They will have some templates and some web based tools to help you creating a web site. This is for free.

You can signup for a free hosting service provider like geocities or brinkster.<br>  <br>  2. You can buy a domain name and server space from any leading web hosting parties.<br>  <br>  To develop web pages it is better if you have some knowledge in HTML. You still can use some web authoring tools like Macromedia Dreamweaver or Adobe GoLive to create your page even if you have no idea about HTML.<br>  <br>  After creating your web page copy and store it in your server space. Once you store that in a public server then it is visible then type the web address using which you can access it.<br>  <br>  Thats it

Flash does have ActionScript which is a language.<br>  <br>  It depends what kind of applications you want to build? Desktop applications, games, or web applications? It's hard to say one language is better than the other or more in demand right now. Plus who knows what will happen in the future or what new languages will come out.<br>  <br>  If you are looking into web applications you can check out PHP, ASP.NET, JSP, ColdFusion, ActionScript, JavaScript, CSS, and XHTML. It's not all about knowing the most languages but having a great understanding of a couple that go together well and finding a job that uses though. For instance I have experience in many web languages but my resume mostly promotes my PHP and JavaScript skills.

Personally, if you really feel the need to clean your registry I would go with a commercial software, for example StompSoft's Registry Repair. By doing this you have access to customer support if something goes wrong, not to mention the ability to have access to well developed and user friendly program interfaces which can make the whole process easier and takes some of the guess work out of trying to figure out what to delete and what not to delete.

(Though this hasn't stopped me from making backups with it every now and then) Instead I use a commercial software; in this case, StompSoft's PC Backup. This allows me to make full back ups on what ever media I want; CDs, USB drives, external drives, etc... My drive of choice is the USB drive. Mostly, because they are small and hold a whole lot of data. Another reason that I use this software is because I can set a schedule and the program will automatically back up and encrypt the data when I want it to so I don't have to worry about it. Not to mention the ability to backup and create a bootable Disaster Recovery CD/DVD as well. This takes the fear factor away for me. :)|`|046b7e6f6c8ec8fd6137e5a62006b8feaa	Hi<br>  <br>  You don't mention whether you have a USB port on your laptop, but most have.  It's a little vertical slit with a white lug in it.  You may have 2 or 3 in the back of your laptop.  If you don't have a USB port, then this answer may not suit you.<br>  <br>  I have tried many backup methods, floppy disc, writeable CD, removable hard disk etc.  I have settled to using a USB external hard drive and Bounceback software.<br>  <br>  The hard drive I would recomment is a Seagate 40gb - 80gb connecting via a USB cable and mains.  <br>  <br>  I have tried most of the main makes, but the backup software I have found most reliable and straightforward to use is Bounceback Pro.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cmsproducts.com/product_bounceback_software.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cmsproducts.com/product_bounc...</a><br>  <br>  It performs a scheduled backup (I do mine at 1.0am the backup takes around 20 - 30 mins)  It is also possible, with the pro version to back up new and modified files on the fly, ie, as they happen and keep an older copy of the file.  This is an invaluable tool because you can get back an old copy very quickly if you need to.<br>  <br>  An external backup drive is also invaluable if you want to keep your backups somewhere secure, if you go on holiday for example.  The Seagate stored vertically looks quite like a book, so I just slip mine into my bookcase and it 'disappears'.<br>  <br>  What size external drive?  Unless you have a lot of graphic, video or audio files, then a 40gb would probably do you.  I have a lot of graphic, video and audio files and needed a 400gb hard drive.<br>  <br>  You can get a reasonably priced Seagate backup drive (the most economic, fast and reliable make I have found) at<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ciao.co.uk/Seagate_Hard_drive_300_GB__6464336" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciao.co.uk/Seagate_Hard_drive...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  What should you back up?<br>  <br>  You don't need to back up your programme files (software) as you can reinstall these, but do keep a record of all your passwords etc and put those somewhere in My Documents in a file that ISN'T called passwords.txt or passwords.doc (for obvious reasons)<br>  <br>  Essential directories are My Documents (where most Microsoft software stores work files), your emails and email address book, You can find Outlook email and address book files in your Documents and Files area under your name, application files/ microsoft/ outlook.  Outlook Express files are in their own directory - you can find out where Outlook and Outlook express email and address book files are by pretending to do an export of your emails and address book and look at the path.  In Thunderbird, they are also in the Documents and Files area under the Thunderbird directory.<br>  <br>  Also back up any financial files if they are not stored in your My Documents folder.<br>  <br>  I have had a few disasters along the way with backups, and they are scarey, but I have been running a Seagate external hard drive and Bounceback Pro for nearly 2 years without any hitch.<br>  <br>  I would recommend this method.<br>  <br>  <br>  achintya|`|2d9d782bbeb11e34ca7ee293cefad3e0aa	Everyone has their own ideas about backups<br>  This is what I do.<br>  <br>  Connected to my Wireless router I have an old 850MHz with a 160GByte External USB hard drive.<br>  <br>  On my Laptop I have an application called SyncBackup SE from<br>  <a href="http://www.2brightsparks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.2brightsparks.com/</a><br>  <br>  SyncBackup is setup such that everyday at 1500 all folders and files within My Documents folder is backed up to the USB drive.<br>  <br>  SyncBackup SE can be setup to do all sorts of things but I like to keep things simple.<br>  <br>  hope this helps.
fb735ba79376725108c611b12d935f0faa	Here is the short and sweet of it. Open a Internet Explorer Window and click on Tools, then select Internet Options... This will bring up a pop up menu with the General tab in the forefront. Which is where you want to be. There will be three sections presented on this window Home Page, Temporary Internet Files and History. Now if you just want to delete the History click on the button labeled "Clear History." This will clean up the history although someone could just look at the cookies and still see where you've been. So if you want to be extra cautious, you can also set the "Days to keep pages in History" to 0. Then under the Temporary Internet Files you can click on the buttons "Delete Files.." and "Delete Cookies." This will eliminate all of your Internet tracks from casual observation. Just keep in mind that a computer savvy person can still retrieve where you have been. So if you are still worried you can get an application like StompSoft's Digital File Shredder.

fb735ba79376725108c611b12d935f0faa	Usually, I suggest using a quality data encryption software such as StompSoft's Digital Vault; as this will allow you to password protect, hide and encrypt files that you want to limit access to. To me this is the best option. <br>  <br>  Other than what I've mentioned, if you are running WinXP you can use the compressed folder utility to create a password protected files. To do this you have to do the following:<br>  <br>  For the sake of simplicity lets say that you want to create the folder on your desktop.<br>  <br>  1. Right click on an empty space on the desktop. This will bring up a sub-menu with several options. You'll want to move your mouse pointer down to the option that says "new"<br>  <br>  2. Once the mouse pointer is on new, another sub menu will appear. You will want to go the the entry that reads "Compressed (zipped) Folder and left click on it. This will create a new folder on your desktop that is named "New Compressed (zipped) folder.<br>  <br>  3. Left click twice on the newly created folder. This will bring up the window to see the folders contents. <br>  <br>  4, Once this window is open add the file that you wish to protect to the folder (drag and drop) and make sure that you use the right mouse button to drag the items into the new compressed folder. otherwise only copies will be added to the compressed folders and the originals will still be where you left them.<br>  <br>  5. Once you have added all of the files that you wish to protect to the folder look toward the top of the window and you will see menu headings that read: File, Edit, View, Favorites, Tools and Help.<br>  <br>  6. Left click on the menu heading that reads "File." This will present a small sub menu.<br>  <br>  7. Left click on the entry that reads "Add a Password." This will bring up the "Add Password" window. <br>  <br>  8. Enter the password that you want to use in the "Password" and "Confirm Password" fields and click OK.<br>  <br>  9. Once the process is completed double click on one of the files that you choose to protect. This should bring up a window that asks for your password. <br>  <br>  10. Everything should be good to go. :) <br>  <br>  Just remember that this is only basic protection and I'd still advise the of encryption software.|`|00aac4033c64fd6e54627ddab7a183d1aa	Right-click the folder that you want to make private and choose "Properties" (or Alt+Double-click). Go to the "Sharing" tab and check the "Make this folder private" box.

e132136686a756d6484ff235a2bb2cd6aa	Well, I can't tell you much, but the general idea is that a sparse matrix consists mainly of elements with value 0. So it's a waste of space to store the entire matrix explicitly. Instead, we store some sort of list of the non-zero entries, and assume that entries not mentioned in the list are zero. <br>  <br>  I don't think there's a definite point at which a matrix becomes sparse, and eligible for this special treatment. It's the classic time-space tradeoff. The link below has some more info.|`|54b385c151eb6a2e169596e7504acbbeaa	sparse matrix ia a matrix which has high proposion of zero entries.<br>  eg: <br>               2 0 0 0 0 0  <br>               2 4 0 0 0 0<br>               3 6 6 0 0 0                      (30 elements)<br>               4 3 3 7 0 0<br>               3 3 3 4 5 0<br>  <br>  This is useful in that case when we've to store only those entries which are non zero.<br>  for eg:<br>  Suppose we want to store the elements of above matrix in a linear array B. As we are only concerning nonzero elements so there is no need to put zeros in memory.So In B we'll 've only 15 elements which are nonzero.<br>  Thus it helps in saving memory space .|`|2a0453152b0483d1b436694bea5d4a5caa	sparse matrix is nohin but a matrix which has most of the values as zeros..<br>  <br>  its implemantation can be done as follows:<br>  create a list for a row head and column head.<br>  the node should contain two poiner field 3 data fields one for row num,col num and value....when an element is inserted its row and column values are checked and the head is traversed accordingly and the element is inserted.create a circular list here<br>  use ur own logic for addition n multiplication..it is not so tough..

Versions are generally significant changes from the last program...like windows 98 to XP was a version change.  Builds are incremental changes like little fixes.  Microsoft updated several severe or critical parts of their software last week and those were different builds (well, technically they were different knowledge base item updates to software processes, but the distiction isn't important to this discussion.)

Any participating network device — including routers, computers, time-servers, printers, Internet fax machines, and some telephones — must have its own unique address. An IP address can also be thought of as the equivalent of a street address or a phone number (compare: VoIP) for a computer or other network device on the internet. Just as each street address and phone number uniquely identifies a building or telephone, an IP address can uniquely identify a specific computer or other network device on a network.|`|8fca156e3aa3b4ab0d7393821fb374b6aa	i.p is ur internet address === Internet Protocol|`|9c6bd27583d5c567c25a88faab691dd4aa	well basically an i.p adress (Internet Protocol address) identifies your computer..its kinda like a fingerprint on your hand...no one else has the same one and it identifies who you are and allows you to connect to different ports and whatnot....<br>  <br>  if ya need to know more. google it?|`|AA11977676	IP stands for Internet Protocol.

It is discussed on TV and in newspapers, and is the subject of many concerned conversations. This online phenomenon has enjoyed an explosive level of growth recently, and every day countless teens and younger children create their very own "space" on the Internet. In itself, this sounds harmless enough - so what exactly are the dangers of MySpace, and what can you do to protect your children?<br>  <br>  Danger One: the written content on MySpace.<br>  The MySpace pages aren't censored, and it shows. The language on most of the pages is colorful to say the least. Do you really want your children to see all those four-letter words? But it's not just the swearing that's problematic, it's the subject, too. Many MySpace pages talk about drinking and drugs, and references to "adult" subject matters abound. Worse still, some pages have very dark undertones and talk about suicide and self-harming. Rest assured, you do not want your children to read this.<br>  <br>  Danger Two: the images on MySpace.<br>  Many of the images posted on MySpace are sexually suggestive. Even if your child hasn't posted a lightly clad photo of herself, you can safely assume that she has seen countless such pictures of other people. Videos are posted, too, and sometimes these are graphic enough to frighten young children - it only took us a minute to find a video of mistreated farm animals, for example.<br>  <br>  Danger Three: MySpace predators.<br>  Because many children and teens post a lot of information about themselves, MySpace is a haven for sexual predators. Anyone can do a search for their local high school and see the details of dozens of girls. Hobbies, interests, date of birth, hair color, friends and much more is often listed for anyone to see. If your child were to post that she's going to be somewhere at a particular time and date, it would be frighteningly easy for someone else to wait for her there.<br>  <br>  Danger Four: unsuitable friends on MySpace<br>  The people your children meet online do not have to be criminals or predators to be unsuitable. In real life, you tend to meet your children's friends, giving you the chance to decide whether or not they're the kind of people you want your children to spend time with. On MySpace, they could meet anyone at all and you have no idea. Do you want your 12-year old daughter to have 18-year-old male friends, no matter how innocent she claims it is? Your children are too young to make informed decisions - they need your help.<br>  <br>  Danger Five: bad behavior on MySpace<br>  Sometimes, the problem isn't other people - it's your child. Imagine if your son were to threaten to kill someone online, and they then happened to get hurt? Or if he bragged about wanting to burn down the school? As a parent, you need to ensure that this isn't taking place, because if the worst were to happen there could be legal ramifications.<br>  <br>  So how do you avoid these MySpace dangers? The easiest, most reliable option is to use parental control software. With SpyBuddy, you can see exactly what your children are doing online. You can view website visits and read emails and instant messages without them ever knowing. If you don't like what you see, you can block access to certain websites, all the time or when you're not at home.<br>  <br>  Of course, you should also talk to your children and explain the dangers to them. But as a safety net, make sure you use SpyBuddy too - because even the best behaved child can be curious, and you need to know what happens when you're not around.|`|49c9bbdae6587789b7f40f7ac265476aaa	Myspace is only dangerous if you put stuff up there that can lead people diretcly to you. Like your street adress and phone number.<br>  Dont give out personal information that your not comfortably with total strangers knowing. Just keep the information on there generic and it will be safe and fun!|`|e7945cbc7abad360065c5d51684ec518aa	Myspace isnt dangerous if u take the right cautions <br>  - Dont give away Informations about ur school or location<br>  - Dont publish Porn Photos<br>  - Set it " Private" so strangers wont be able 2 talk 2 u only ur friends<br>  <br>  Dangers:<br>  -getting kidnaped|`|2ae6f72c5d4a4607116312be1b472a5faa	Every little thing|`|43fd386be968ced808d243ba912e9867aa	I heard that they catch most online perdadors on MySpace.

90de291fd4a790991cdfd303029efea8aa	The reason SW serial numbers are so long is that they include check characters, that is, numbers that are not really part of the serial number but that they are calculated from the real serial number. Only if all those match up is it a valid serial number. Of course they don't tell you which characters are the check nor how to calculate them, so you can't make them up.<br>  <br>  The credit card numbers have something similar, called a Luhn check.|`|bd87492d7aa34c19253c07fb2fb88df5aa	Many programs "call home" over the internet to check for updates, they may also check the serial number as well when they do this.  One of the more famous examples of this would be Microsoft Windows XP's "Windows Genuine Advantage Validation".<br>  <br>  I do not use Photoshop CS, so I can't advise as to whether the program contact's Adobe's servers for serial number validation.  <br>  <br>  If you want to block communication you could disconnect the internet connection, or use a firewall program like Zonealarm to disallow Photoshop CS from accessing the internet - although this would impact software updates, and could prevent you from viewing help.

It's not really much different, the processor speed is a bit higher and that's pretty much it. If you're willing to spend like SGD3999 for a laptop, just go for SZ38GP/C. No one will never love this type, it's so light, made of carbon fibre, a real slim monitor, the dual processor is high in speed, 2 slots of 1MB RAM, harddisk is 120MB, and the monitor is different. all 3 types got harddisk protection, but this 38 is more durable.<br>  just visit the website to get more information about it.|`|AA10239227	sony is a good product for laptops,all is good

( XP-Home) Go up below browser to Tools > Internet Options > System Tools > Disk Cleaner & click on it.& follow prompts. Make sure no programs are running(nothing on Task bar) This will gain you space. Then do the defragmenter thing, right there where you got the cleaner. That will gather fragmented parts of files & programs that were scattered all over the disk when you downloaded them, there wasn't room in one place to write the program or file in one place. I was amazed to watch it as it did its thing. I really gained some space & speed, because now when I wanted to bring up a program, the computer could find it fast, all in one tidy piece.

Try putting in in the last PCI slot or the one before that.|`|sr5QiFuwaa	Is your device still under warranty? If it is, then you should take it back to a creative shop to get it fixed. They would usually do a 1 for 1 exchange for your faulty sound device.. at least for me in Singapore.<br>  <br>  Other than that, your computer might be infected by viruses. Some viruses prohibit the functions of hardware drivers. You might want to do a virus scan to ensure your computer is running normally.

9f496d62eff05d73b64265cbddafaca5aa	Its really very simple todo.  First you should start off by taking pictures of whatever it is that you are going to sell.  Next you want to goto ebay.com and click on the "sell" section.  It is kind of difficult where to tell you togo after that only because it will depend on what you are selling.  Basically it will give you catagories for your item and you need to pick which one it falls best under.  If you want to pay more you can list it under several sections.  After you type in what you want your title to be and list it under the proper section or sections they will walk you through the rest.  It will be a step by step sort of thing.  You will have to upload your picture and type a discription about your item and all that like you see when buying an item.  You will have to set a price that you want your bidding to start at.  You can also set a reserve price which is hidden and only you know.  What that does it unless the bidding goes up to the price you determine it will not sell.  It cost $2 todo that option but if your item sells you get that money back.  As far as how much it till cost to sell an item that goes on a case by case basis.  It is hard to say really what EXACTLY it will cost.  they have the percentages on the ebay site, but I am not really good at that kind of stuff.  I will give you an example though so you have a rough idea.  I sold an item that I did have a reserve price set for.  I start the bidding out at a dollar (the cheaper you set the starting bid the cheaper it will be for you to list it).  I did meet my reserve and the item sold for around $150.  I think the initail fee was like $4.36 to list the item (keep in mind that will vary depending on all the options you pick)  then it was like a 3.67 final value fee (you pay this at the end of auction depending on what it goes for).  So my total was like $8 but I got $2 back for my reserve pricing.  So it did end up being like $6 total.  Keep in mind if you use paypal as a payment option that will cost you as well when they pay.  That fee will be deducted when they pay you (it will come right out off the money they send you).  I think my fee was just under $4 or $5 for this item.  Your auction can be alot cheaper if you don't add things like picture galleries and stuff like that, but that is the stuff that catches peoples eye, so you need to think about all that really while your are setting it up.  I hope I didn't make this to confusing for you.  Its really quite simple todo because they walk you through it for the most part on the web site.  Good-luck|`|33fac7e525e6060a253b0296325fe605aa	<a href="http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/newsellers.html" rel="nofollow">http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/news...</a><br>  <br>  This link should give you all the info you need.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, I guess, is to use common sense.

Have been selling on eBay since 2003 and have sold 12,000 items worldwide. Take the eBay Selling Audio Tour<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/education/howtosell/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://pages.ebay.com/education/howtosel...</a><br>  <br>  First of all, start small. Set up an eBay account and buy a few things to learn the process and get a feel for how eBay works. eBay and working at home is not for everyone. And it is ok if it isn’t right for you. Sell some of your own things before you invest any money in other products to sell. Understand that eBay is more than taking pictures and working on the computer – you need to be familiar with how to edit photos, shipping, customer service, and Paypal. Take your time and learn about these things before you jump in and go for it full-time.<br>  <br>  Once you are comfortable with the whole process, don’t be afraid to take a risk every now and then. I am often asked, “But what if you buy an item and it doesn’t sell?” Well, that’s ok. I can always relist it. I can mark it down and sell it for what I paid for it and move on. You don’t want to buy a truckload of 1,000 items without having tested them out first, but you do want to experiment with different products – you may find something profitable to sell on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  Make small investments and try new products to test them out and see what kind of results you’ll get. Don’t be afraid to experiment with new products and try new things. eBay is constantly evolving and no trend will last forever. Experience is the best teacher.<br>  <br>  Good luck-<br>  <br>  S.

jm6bt1slaa	a mi siempre me ha encantado GOOGLE.. me da mejores resultados|`|TZOvZ61qaa	sin duda st. google|`|EzLRBrzJaa	google|`|2a7faaddc6a92c95ce24df306dfd0f19aa	el google es el mejor buscador que existe ya que tiene un chingo de paginas que hasta la peor mensada que se te ocurra sale aparte de que puedes elegir el idioma que quieres que salgan las respuestas sin duda<br>  google es el mejor jaja|`|Ph3Vwsnpaa	Hola hatje_67:<br>  Creo advertir cierta confusión (confesada)  en tu pregunta.<br>  Sobre todo entre Navegador y Buscador, que son dos cosas bien distintas.<br>  Un navegador (como Mozilla Firefox o IE) sirve para navegar la red. Tienes que decirle a qué página quieres conectarte para acceder a su contenido.<br>  Un buscador  (como Google, Yahoo o MSN) en cambio, se encarga de buscar en millones de páginas las palabras que hayas cargado como argumento de búsqueda.<br>  Para ponerlo en un ejemplo más sencillo, con un navegador debes saber adonde quieres ir, con un buscador estás tratando de averiguar adonde quieres ir.<br>  Espero que se entienda.<br>  Saludos<br>  Ricardo<br>  <br>  Postdata:<br>  para atenerme estrictamente al texto de tu pregunta, debo responder que el mejor buscador es Google (para búsqueda por palabras) y el mejor navegador (para mi gusto, y por razones técnicas) es el Firefox de Mozilla.<br>  Que haya una barra de búsqueda de google en la configuración habitual del Firefox, no debe inducirte a confundir una cosa con la otra.|`|fr5KfYiyaa	Google. Es rapido y da muchas opciones.|`|1d06315a392ce91c1fa3aa26b0197e72aa	Mozilla Firefox es un navegador, al igual que el Internet Explorer y se pueden tener ambos. Firefox es más seguro, tiene más plugins y funciones, por ejemplo el Videodownloader que te permite descargar videos de internet sólo con un click, un traductor que con poner el puntero del mouse sobre una palabra en inglés muestra sus significados en castellano, se lo puede configurar para borrar todas las cookies y toda la información al cerrar el navegador, tiene  un sistema de navegación por pesta?as que el Explorer 7 le copió, un cliente de correo alternativo al Outlook Express: el Mozilla Thunderbird, etc. Podés descargar Firefox poniendo su nombre en google y google es lo primero que te aparece cuando abrís el navegador Firefox. saludos.|`|568eb6d1c73279c1dd5955de5067d6c3aa	Hola que tal... Yo siempre he encontrado todo lo que busco en Yahoo.com.mx, creo que es cuestión de saber buscar. La mayoria de personas que conozco no sabe como buscar, o mas bien no escribe las palabras correctas que debe poner en el buscador para que le de respuestas mas precisas de lo que buscan|`|5Wv8zHP7aa	google o yahoo los 2 son muy buenos...|`|7b6ebe1d36e6cd02913395ed829388f4aa	Mira, el firefox no es un buscador, sino un navegador de internet. A mi me agrada más que el Internet Explorer por que el firefox es software libre y es más versátil y con más plugins que el Explorer.<br>  <br>      Apoyemos el Software libre, y no permitamos que Microsuave monopolize todo lo que esté a su alcance.<br>  <br>      Si me preguntas de buscadores, pues todos tienen lo suyo. Técnicamente google y yahoo son casi lo mismo. Pero ?Por qué no intentas con altavista?|`|7jsKnHbHaa	Para mí los mejores buscadores son GOOGLE y YAHOO.<br>  WIKIPEDIA no es un buscador pero si es un enciclopedia libre. WIKIPEDIA suele tener más información que GOOGLE y YAHOO.<br>  Vos podés fijarte de que cuando buscás el fuego, la brújula, etc. lo primero que te aparece en la pág. de GOOGLE es la página de  WIKIPEDIA con toda la información.<br>  <br>  Páginas:<br>  <a href="http://www.google.com.ar/" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com.ar/</a><br>  <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portada/" rel="nofollow">http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portada/</a><br>  <a href="http://ar.yahoo.com/">http://ar.yahoo.com/</a><br>  <br>  //////////////////////////////////////...|`|e44bbf2b58476d7e83d138318fc6da9baa	sin duda los los mejores que hay son el google y el yahoo, pero como dice uno de los chicos ahi son casi lo mismo, yo preferentemente y por nada en especial sino por cosa mia uso para buscar paginas, info y todo eso uso el yahoo y para las fotos el google pero por mania mia nada mas y el fire fox es un explorador y que personalmente  es el mejor, he probado el internet explorer, el opera, netscape y el firefox se lleva todas las estrellas y por ser gratuito es una barbaridad.|`|f333f4d417c58c8dbc4924ade3d971acaa	hay te embio un link donde encuentras todos los buscadores escoje el que mejor te guste<br>  <br>  suerte.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tnrelaciones.com/anexo/buscadores/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tnrelaciones.com/anexo/buscad...</a>|`|pbcfvsZVaa	el mejor  sin duda es google

Delete some unnecessary files:<br>  <br>  Run Program Files --> Accessories --> System Tools --> Disk Cleanup|`|Hs5nK1sNaa	A computer's virtual memory is an amount of hard disk space that acts as temporary memory, just like Random Access Memory (RAM). One analogy is that your computer is like a stadium. Your hard disk space is the number of people who can fit in the stands. Your memory (RAM) is the number of people who can play on the field at a given time. Virtual memory "borrows" some space from the stands to be used for the field. Your computer should automatically assign an amount of space from your hard disk to be used as virtual memory. To set it manually (assuming you are using a Windows System), open the control panel. Next, open the System Icon. Click on the Advanced Tab. In the performance block, select the settings button. Once again, select settings, then Advanced, then change. Good luck!|`|f89bef070b3107366dcdba13a6c7e55baa	You didn't give the details why it's slow. Primary reasons could be too many programs opened or many tasks are running at the background.

yUMXP4VWaa	It doesn't matter how many are running. It only matters how much RAM and processor it's using. <br>  <br>  ctrl+alt+dlt shows you how many programs you have running how much CPU percentage your using and how much memory your using(all along the bottom bar). If you notice that the cpu or memory is maxing out, sort your process list by whatever is maxing out('mem usage' or 'CPU') and see whats hogging your computer. You can then kill the process if you don't need it but right clicking it. Or manually close the program.|`|c466b9fe384ccd2f6427a9a20ea03052aa	As few as you can comfortably work with.

oBZyAQzraa	I'm sorry, but the NVIDIA TNT is a horrible video card...I don't even think it's 3D-compatible. You're better off getting a video card that's at least 128mb...AGP by the sound of your motherboard.
TjpEICABaa	Did you install the appropriate driver for the microphone to work?? <br>  <br>  Enter devmgmt.msc into Start > Run to open Device Manager<br>  <br>  Check to see if theres a yellow exclamation in your "sound,video or game controllers" item. If there is, then you need to install driver, check your manual, search the web.|`|AA11072784	Time to get a new microphone. It happened to me!|`|8vrrU57Caa	Try updating drivers in Device Manager.<br>  Maybe the mic is damaged|`|fd3467b3c7ea8beca036fff4cae978feaa	You probably have a newer computer that came with a lot of stuff installed.  Usually computer companies will through in a couple of extra small programs that run things like microphones and stuff.  So when you go to interact with Microsoft stuff and try to use the Microphone with Windows programs, you get issues.  Fortunately they usually have a quick launch button, those are the buttons down by the time in the lower right hand corner.  Time to get familiar with your computer.  Click on every single button until you find one that controls audio.  Play around with it for a while and you will probably come to a place where it talks about microphones.  You will have to find the specific place that it calls the microphone from.  It will probably allow you to run a test as well for the microphone.  Chances are this is the problem.  But since I can't see your computer nor see what programs are running on it, I can't make the determinatiion.  It probably isn't your sound card, 99/100 it is software issues.|`|uaMFR4fdaa	The other answers have been good.  Check them out.<br>  <br>  I'd also try:<br>  <br>  Try a different mic.  Computer microphones are a dime a dozen.  See if that's the issue.<br>  <br>  Try your mic on a different computer that you know works.<br>  <br>  Make sure you've got the mic plugged into the right port.  They can be kind of confusing.

tvDEOlhUaa	There has been a long-standing debate regarding the copying of DVD's.  Many assert that "Fair Use" allows you to make a copy of a DVD that you have purchased for your own personal use--but thats another issue but most agree that ANY other use of DVD content is a No No<br>  <br>  That being said, Slysoft's AnyDVD is a tool that removes automatically the CSS copy protection and RPC region codes from your DVDs in the moment you insert the disc in. <br>  <br>  So, with AnyDVD you can use all the DVD backup tools, such as CloneDVD without having to rip the DVD to your HDD first. <br>  <br>  Software also overrides your DVD-ROM drive's region code mechanism, so even if you have RPC-2 locked DVD-ROM drive, you can still watch DVDs from any country in the world with your PC.|`|4d51e7b98e9d0813bb18bd4701645116aa	dvd shrink.|`|AA10239227	yes,

55474b711a6c2377665e85b5c171cfc6aa	Hola!!! El Windows Vista es un sistema muy nuevo en el mercado. De seguro con el correr del tiempo, aparecerán los denominados “parches” y “Services Packs”, hasta lograr su funcionamiento óptimo. Además, es un sistema que requiere muchos recursos y para que las aplicaciones funcionen correctamente, se necesita al menos 1 Gb de  memoria Ram. Por otro lado, se deberá tener en cuenta en que tipo de PC se ha de instalar, por cuanto, dependiendo de la antigüedad de la misma, algunas aplicaciones funcionaran lentamente mientras que ciertas funciones puede que no estén  disponibles, volviéndose, en consecuencia, en un sistema lento para esos casos. Además, las empresas que desarrollan software, aun no han tenido el tiempo necesario para adaptar sus programas y hacerlos compatibles con este nuevo sistema, razón por la cual, no hay gran variedad de aplicaciones  que funcionen en el. A esto habrá que sumarle, que actualmente resulta difícil encontrar controladores dise?ados para que los dispositivos de hardware, que conforman la mayoría de los equipos, funcionen bajo este sistema operativo. Por el momento, te recomiendo que adquieras un equipo con el sistema operativo XP.<br>  Saludos!!!|`|9SJJ7KGpaa	Windows Vista es la última versión del Sistema Operativo Windows, es como el XP, Win2000, Win 98, sólo que con muchas mejoras y novedades, obvio, ya que es la última versión.<br>  <br>  Mira, si el Vista  es el de 32bits, no tendrás problemas con la compatibilidad de los programas. Con un procesador normal y una RAM de 512 megas, te correrá bien. <br>  <br>  Si el Vista es de 32bits, te recomiendo que te quedes con el.<br>  <br>  El problema se presentaría con un Windows Vista de 64bits. En primer lugar el procesador que traiga tu compu debe ser de 64bits. Y tendrías que tener como mínimo un 1 giga de memoria RAM. Para que tu compu  no sea haga lenta. Segundo, aquí si tendrías problemas de compatibilidad de la mayoría de programas.<br>  <br>  Si por un caso compras la portátil con un Windows Vista 64x, ten presente que la mayoria de programas que actualmente existen en el mercado corren en una platafora de 32x (como el XP y los anteriores Windows). Lo que tienes que hacer es conseguir versiones de los programas que quieres instalar que corran en Vista de 64x. Cada programa trae sus instrucciones y allí te dira si trae soporte para el Vista 64.<br>  Como ya he mencionado, existe tambien un Windows Vista de 32x (o 32 bits), en este caso la instalación de tus progamas no te daría problema. Consulta las instrucciones de los programas que le instalarás a tu portátil. Es probable que no puedas instalarte el eMule o cualquier otro programa que descargues de internet, por la incompatiblidad, en caso de que sea Windows Vista de 64x (64 bits). En cuanto a los programas piratas, Vista si controla mucho el asunto y es muy probable que restrinja la instalación de dichos programas.<br>  <br>  <br>  Si el Vista es de 32bits, bien podrías probarlo pero te recomendaría que mejor uses el Windows XP Professional. <br>  El que es más recomendable para las portátiles es el Windows XP Professional (con Service Pack 2).<br>  Pero, allá tu si quieres probar el nuevo Windows Vista. Recuerda que no en vano dicen: "Vale más lo viejo conocido que lo nuevo por conocer".<br>  <br>  <br>  A mi no me parece gran novedad el Vista. Prefiero el XP.<br>  O esperar a que salga el Windows Vienna (o Windows 7) que  es el sustituto de Vista, pero tendré que esperar hasta el 2009.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Te gustan las comedias? Quieres reírte un poco? Mira el reportorio de películas que presento como mis recomendaciones. Seguro alguna te gustará y te hará pasar un rato divertido.

En cambio , con Vista ( mi empresa lo ha instalado recientemente ) , el trabajo se hace pesado . A parte de esto que para mi es esencial, de momento las compa?ías no apuestan mucho por Vista , por ejemplo , me bajé un programa de edición de audio y solo había version xp o 2000 . <br>  <br>  Cierto es que quizás sea un avance , pero yo lo veo minoritario . Yo que tambien soy jugón , lo compararía con el fenomeno Playstation 3 , no solo por la relacion calidad precio , si no porque mucha mejora no puede aver . <br>  <br>  Concluyendo , Vista me parece un simple experimento , esperemos que Microsoft mejore esta versión que de momento esta de capa caida .|`|PChoZfFhaa	Yo no te lo recomiendo, viene con muchos fallos, que aun no se pueden solucionar hasta que no pase un tiempo, mi hermano se lo ha comprado y lo va a desinstalar por que no le deja descargarse nada.|`|e8784519bc875655a55756ce904ead80aa	No te creas todo lo que dicen por ahí, no todo lo malo que se cuenta del Vista es cierto. <br>  <br>  Pero no, no lo recomiendo.

Es muy incompatible con programas para versiones anteriores y no está siendo aceptado como debiera. <br>  <br>  Se empieza a correr el rumor de que pueda ser un sistema operativo "de paso", como ocurrió con el Millenium antes del XP Home, ya que Microsoft ya ha avanzado que está preparando su nuevo sistema operativo, llamado "Vienna", con lo que a lo mejor en menos de dos a?os, los usuarios que se pasen de XP no encuentren tiempo de recibir soporte decente para el Vista, les saquen un Windows nuevo y se queden con un S.O. obsoleto.|`|fead92658af1283f5036d3d24f1e801eaa	No es cierto todo lo q has escuchado... aqui te dejo una informacion que puede serte util<br>  <br>  10 Mitos sobre Windows Vista, desmentidos....<br>  <br>  Mucho se ha hablado de Windows Vista ultimamente, y muchas mentiras y rumores sobre el nuevo sistema operativo de Microsoft circulan por la red. Sin ir mas lejos estos son los mitos/mentiras sobre Windows Vista, y una breve explicacion sobre cada uno.<br>  <br>  Mito 1: Vas a tener que comprar una nueva Super-PC para ejecutar Vista.<br>  <br>  Este mito indudablemente esta siendo fomentado por los vendedores de Hardware, pero no es cierto. Si bien Vista necesita algo mas de memoria RAM y un procesador relativamente moderno, no es necesario tener una Super-PC. Por ejemplo para ejecutar Windows Vista Home Basic necesitariamos como minimo:<br>  <br>  Procesador de 800 MHz y 512 MB de RAM <br>  20 GB de espacio en disco con al menos 15 GB libres <br>  Soporte para graficos Super VGA <br>  CD-ROM <br>  <br>  <br>  Mito 2: Vista resolveria todos tus problemas de seguridad. <br>  <br>  Como muchos sistemas operativos, incluyendo tecnologia de redes, este fue redise?ado, por lo que probablemente Vista presente muchas vulnerabilidades que no estaban en versiones de sistemas operativos anteriores, aunque haya solucionado muchos bugs. Estos es cierto para cualquier software nuevo y para Vista, a pesar de que Microsoft a puesto todos sus esfuerzos en el tema Seguridad.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mito 3: Vista es menos seguro que XP con SP2.<br>  <br>  Es cierto que, con su correspondiente actualizacion, Windows XP es “algo mas seguro”. Pero Vista incluye nuevas medidas de seguridad que XP no posee.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mito 4: Lo unico nuevo en Vista es el aspecto visual. <br>  <br>  Cambiar a Vista es mas que pasarse a una linda interface. Ademas de los cambios en seguridad mencionados anteriormente, muchos aspectos del sistema operativo fueron improvizados para mejorar la usabilidad y proveer nuevas funcionalidades.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mito 5: No podes hacer dual-boot con Vista y otro sistema operativo. <br>  <br>  Una de las mas raras e inexactas declaraciones que escuche fue “Con Vista, no podes ejecutar 2 sistemas operativos en la misma computadora como se hacia antes”. Actualmente estoy ejecutando Vista y XP en una misma computadora sin inconvenientes.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mito 6: Vista requiere (o incluye) Office 2007. <br>  <br>  He visto varias referencias a la necesidad de actualizarse a Office 2007 cuando instalas Vista. Por supuesto que podes hacerlo, pero no es un requerimiento. Office 2003 corre perfectamente en Vista.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mito 7: La mayoria de los perifericos y aplicaciones viejas no funcionaran en Vista.<br>  <br>  Algunos programas dise?ados para XP, especialmente aquellos que utilizan mucho el kernel, como antivirus y programas de utilidades del sistema, no funcionaran en Vista. Sin embargo la mayoria de las aplicaciones que corren en XP tambien correran en Vista.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mito 8: Tenes que adquirir la version Premium de Vista si tenes un ordenador dual core. <br>  <br>  Llendo a los hechos, todas las versiones de Vista corren en ordenadores con multiples procesadores instalados –pero las versiones Home Basic y Premium reconocerian y usarian solo uno de los procesadores.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mito 9: No podras reproducir musica “ripeada” en Vista. <br>  <br>  Personalmente no tengo problemas en reproducir archivos de musica que fueron “ripeados” o extraidos de CD’s de audio en Windows Media Player 10. Aunque posea esos CDs legalmente o no, Vista no tiene forma de saberlo.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mito 10: Vista es mucho mas caro que XP.<br>  <br>  Windows XP venia solo en 2 versiones: Home, que tenia un precio de $199 por el paquete completo y $99 por la actualizacion, y Professional, $299 por el paquete completo y $199 por la actualizacion. Vista te proporciona mas opciones:<br>  <br>  Home Basic: $199 full, $99 actualizacion <br>  Home Premium: $239 full, $159 actualizacion <br>  Business: $299 full, $199 actualizacion <br>  Ultimate: $399 full, $259 actualizacion <br>  <br>  Suerte|`|mHIMG8zGaa	Si la verdad que esta bueno el vista, pero pide un tremendo ordenador!!!!<br>  Con respecto a los programas el BitTorrent me va bien, el ares lo tengo instalado pero no me descarga.<br>  Y el nero no lo puedo instalar!!!

A corrupt OS does not mean harddisk sector corruption, so as long as u low format it, u use it again.<br>  <br>  If u think the harddisk is old and may give way soon.  You can still use it as a secondary harddisk for storing not important stuff.<br>  <br>  Please note! low level format is not the same as the normal format by dos or ms.<br>  <a href="http://hddguru.com/content/en/software/2006.04.12-HDD-Low-Level-Format-Tool/" rel="nofollow">http://hddguru.com/content/en/software/2...</a>|`|AA11241790	<a href="http://www.whitecanyon.com/wipedrive-erase-hard-drive.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.whitecanyon.com/wipedrive-era...</a>  Is the answer provided you have your recovery disc.

Your best bet is to systematically remove all of your programs (since maybe one of your programs is corrupt and not Windows XP).  Then as a last resort you can finally remove Windows XP.  If you haven't already, you might want to invest in a good antivirus program.  Good luck.
TjpEICABaa	Check your BIOS, access it by pressing F10 or observe your startup screen to see what key you need to hit. Anyways, after getting into the BIOS mode, most notebooks have the ability to re-profile your battery.

A new window will open, at the very bottom of this window, set how many days you would like IE to keep your history.

Registration on the free filehost is optional. If you use it for free video hosting, it has an embedded video play so you can watch videos or play MP3s on the video download pages. The download speeds are unrestricted. The free filesharing web servers let you host up to 500 megabytes of any type of file, and your hosted file will be on their webservers for at least 30 days (usually longer). You can also send your download links to friends via emails by giving the email addresses in the file upload form. There is no bandwidth limit and no download limit -- they do not remove the uploaded files from the web server regardless of how much traffic they receive. The file download webpage has a 30-second delay counter before the file download can begin. The free filehosting services are powered by the "Easy File Share" script from PeerGoal.com.<br>  <a href="http://www.free-webhosts.com/image-hosting/Free-File-Host/" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-webhosts.com/image-hosti...</a><br>  <br>  Select File to Upload (Up to 500 MB):<br>  <a href="http://free-file-host.com/" rel="nofollow">http://free-file-host.com/</a>

CDbl converts a text value to a double value (i.e. a number with a lot of decimals.)<br>  <br>  The command is taking the text values of two numbers, converting them to numbers that can be used mathematically, and then converting the result to a string to be put into the text1 field.  More specifically, it's incrementing text1 with the value from text2.  You need CDbl here because the values the user enters in text1 and text2 will be considered text values rather than numbers, and VB cannot add text values.|`|MTV2nL33aa	its a formula.....<br>  <br>  lazy.student = don't listen in lessons + expects others to do their homework.|`|jRbsA7Y9aa	CDbl function is a "Type Conversion" function.

AA10239227	mac pc is the best for me,cos alot of people dont know how to use them.but give me some years from now.mac will be everywhere|`|AA10700604	Hello JDiddy,<br>  <br>  Go for the MacBook.  You won't regret it.<br>  <br>  OK here's my list of things I like about the Macintosh over Windows.  I'm sorry that it is so long, but that's how it goes.<br>  <br>  *  No computer viruses.  <br>  You hear from the Windows people that it's because there are fewer Macs out there, but I think it's because of the Mac OS and it's Unix kernel.  That doesn't explain why Vista got viruses before it was officially released.  The Macintosh comes out of the box as a closed system.  If you want it to be networked and remotely operated, you can make that happen, but you have to change it's settings first.  Windows machines come out of the box as a wide open vulnerable system.    That's so the IT guy can set up the hardware, attach it to the company's network, and install the software remotely from the comfort of his own desk.  ActiveX and InternetExplorer leaves the Windows OS wide open to hacks and viruses.  The Macintosh OS simply isn't set up that way. <br>  <br>  If you want to install any kind of software onto your Mac, you first need to type in your administrative password.  There is no auto-install for a virus to attach itself to your Mac without your Okay.  That is the simple answer why there hasn't been any viruses for the Macintosh in the past 6 years.  Another is that first year programmers learn how to create simple Windows script viruses their first year of class.  Mac programmers simply love their computers and have no desire to create such an abomination.  We love our Mac programmers and happily pay what ever they ask for their good, hard work.<br>  <br>  *  Games.  <br>  I enjoy the games that I play on my Mac, but It's true that there simply aren't as many games out there for the Mac as Windows.  Hopefully, with the Mac now using an Intel processor, we will start to see more games being developed for the Mac.  But, honestly, don't most people get their gaming fix by playing with video game consoles (such as NES, PS, Wii, or XBox), rather than playing games on their computers?<br>  <br>  *  Software.  <br>  There's a lot more software for the Macintosh now, than before Mac OS X arrived.  Much of the Mac's new software is simply Unix ports.  There is also a large open source and public domain/shareware development community that has been supporting the Mac OS.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/</a><br>  <br>  You can run Unix X-windows on your Macintosh now too.  Apple has been designated as the largest distributor of Unix in the world.  If you have one of the new Intel-based Macs you can now run Windows programs natively using a program called Boot Camp and/or Parallel.  There is also a Java Virtual Machine for the Mac too.<br>  <br>  There's still a ton of programs made specifically for the Mac.  Most of these are programmed in machine language, so they're lightening fast.  Apple watches over their developers closely, to make sure everything runs like it's supposed to; that it runs the Macintosh way.  There's also a lot of Windows ports too.  I use Microsoft Office on my Mac at work all the time. Although the Macintosh versions of Windows software are way behind in features than their Windows brethren, the Macintosh programs seem to run better, faster and are not as susceptible to problems as the Windows ports.  Go figure!<br>  <br>  Where the Macintosh really shines is in the creative software area.  I'm a printer, so I know that the Macintosh pioneered desktop publishing.  I think that most structured drawing, paint/graphics, and music programs got their start here too.  Video and film editing and production is now very big on the Mac.  Many people complain about how expensive some of these programs are, but frankly, professional programs are always more expensive than the cheaper consumer-level programs that are out there.  Stuff like iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, etc. come free with your Macintosh, while other programs are quite affordable.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/macosx" rel="nofollow">http://www.versiontracker.com/macosx</a><br>  <br>  *  Less problems<br>  The Macintosh simply works.  There really isn't very many problems using a Mac compared to a Windows PC.  Check out the computer questions here on Yahoo! Answers.  There are a lot of Windows,  "Why can't I get this to work?" questions here.  Even though there are a lot of Mac users here, there doesn't seem to be very many Mac questions.  The Mac simply works.  Naturally, there are a few problems with any kind of computer hardware, but these are few and far between on a Mac.<br>  <br>  * Hardware Power -vrs- Expense<br>  <br>  Right, the Macintosh is a little more proprietary and you really need to buy hardware that tells you that it's Macintosh compatible.  You can't just buy some cheap hardware, piece it together, and make a Mac, like you can with some PCs.  But, then, you don't have Plug-and-Pray either.  Again, the Mac simply works.<br>  <br>  We also hear from Windows users that Windows PCs are cheaper than Macs.  True, you can buy hardware with the barest of graphics cards, hard drives, and other components, or you can buy the best and end up spending the same amount as a Mac.  It's your choice, but that's why you see Macs holding up and being used a lot longer than these Window PCs.<br>  <br>  Oh, and since we're talking about hardware, yes, you can get yourself a USB multiple-buttoned mouse, plug it into your Mac, and use it just fine, thank you.  Don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  *  Mac OS X<br>  It's a very simple, basic, easy-to-use OS.  It's highly graphic, so your kids or your grandmother could learn to use it, and it's also got a terminal, so the geekiest guy can enjoy using it to it's fullest extent.  Windows users will recognize many of the same features that they use on their OS, but there are a few things that are strictly Macintosh.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/switch101/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/support/switch101/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/mac101/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/support/mac101/</a><br>  <a href="http://switchtoamac.com/guides/" rel="nofollow">http://switchtoamac.com/guides/</a><br>  <br>  I have loved it because it's always responsive.  You throw in a CD and the icon for it pops up on the desktop along with a dialog box asking if you want a specific program to use with it.  There's no need to search for drives.  If it's a music CD, iTunes launches to play it.  If you plug in your digital camera iPhoto launches to import the pictures.  If you're looking for a file buried deep inside your Mac's file structure, you can use Spotlight and it might find the file before you're done typing the first three letters of the name.<br>  <br>  Again, I'm sorry that this is so long, but I get tired of the misinformation that the Windows guys are spreading about the Macintosh, and I wanted to be sure to respond to all of their rants with the facts.  Go into your local Macintosh dealer and play with the Macintosh yourself, and see what you think.  Best of luck with your final decision.  Take care.<br>  <br>  --Rick|`|e7073deda810b7dbd0f5a9afb258f6ecaa	HP 530 is beter than Macbook.

Run a spyware scan at sunbelt-software.com/dell/scan.cfm and try to create a new user account and see if you have the same error. Also try to boot to F8 into safe mode to see if you have the same issue, sounds like spyware/malware to me but these should get you started on trying to resolve the issue, if you can do a system restore to before this happened that might also help. Good luck.

3p2z9mMvaa	No.  Financially speaking your best bet is always to pay cash.  I would research the computer you need/want, get a picture of it, put the picture on a jar, and start saving!  If you look at the crazy interest those places charge, you'll end up paying enough to buy 10 computers!  Never finance unless the item is extremely expensive (like a house or car).  Things like this are what get you in to trouble (and bad credit) in the first place.  In the meantime, go to your local library and use their computer for free.|`|PxpSxoBzaa	The answer is *no*, these sites will rip you off. You need to buy a computer at a computer store, and get the financing through your own means.<br>  <br>  Or preferably, save money until you can afford to buy the PC outright.

e0L8Wvg6aa	Well, unfortunately the military doesn't have satellites tasked to provide pictures of every acre of our world. You can get a Google Earth picture of your house, but the date of when the picture is taken is unknown. The chances of getting the picture on that exact date are slim to none, unless you know an intelligence officer for the military who might have retasked a 70 million dollar satellite to have a glimpse of your neighborhood. Good luck!|`|AA12166648	You cant. Places like Google Earth only take a picture once. There is no 24/7 satellite watching your house. Think about it.

Perhaps this will help.<br>  <br>  First check your HOSTS file located at<br>  <br>  Windows XP = C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC <br>  Windows 2K = C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC <br>  Win 98/ME = C:\WINDOWS <br>  Be sure and check-mark "Show Hidden Files and Folders" and uncheck-mark "Hide Protected Operating System Files" in your Folder Options first.<br>  <br>  Open HOSTS with notepad. A 'standard" MS HOSTS file will look like this:<br>  <br>  # Copyright ? 1993-1999 Microsoft Corp.<br>  # <br>  # This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.<br>  # <br>  # This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names.

The IP address should<br>  # be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.<br>  # The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one<br>  # space.<br>  # <br>  # Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual<br>  # lines or following the machine name denoted by a "#" symbol.<br>  # <br>  # For example:<br>  # <br>  # 102.54.94.97 rhino.acme.com # source server<br>  # 38.25.63.10 x.acme.com # x client host<br>  # <br>  127.0.0.1 localhost<br>  <br>  ______________________________...<br>  <br>  There should be no entries or IP addresses on the lines below "127.0.0.1 localhost".

1pTHoFNZaa	You already have a firewall built into Windows. The thing is that the original Windows firewall is only one way, so it isn't all that good. I would suggest that you download ZoneAlarm, even though it is a pain in the butt to configure.<br>  <br>  o to: <a href="http://www.download.com/zonealarm/3000-2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/zonealarm/3000-2...</a> to download ZoneAlarm.<br>  <br>  ZoneAlarm is designed to protect your DSL- or cable-connected PC from hackers. This program includes four interlocking security services: a firewall, an application control, an Internet lock, and Zones. The firewall controls the door to your computer and allows only traffic you understand and initiate. The application control allows you to decide which applications can and cannot use the Internet. The Internet lock blocks Internet traffic while your computer is unattended or while you're not using the Internet, and it can be activated automatically with your computer's screensaver or after a set period of inactivity. Zones monitor all activity on your computer and alert you when a new application attempts to access the Internet. Version 7.0 may include unspecified updates, enhancements, or bug fixes.<br>  <br>  Note:ZoneAlarm is free for individual and not-for-profit charitable entity use (excluding governmental entities and educational institutions. Advanced features are available within 15-day period.<br>  <br>  An effective and easy-to-use firewall program, ZoneAlarm does a great job of keeping your PC safe from a variety of threats. ZoneAlarm uses a simple wizard to make configuring a firewall, which seems like a daunting task to many computer users, incredibly easy. Maintaining and updating settings also is a snap when you're using the stylish interface and its simple slider controls. The program's Zones feature allows you to assign different security levels for a local network and for the Internet.<br>  <br>  A great recent addition is small but quite helpful. A new "Game Mode" lets you automatically allow or deny alerts when you're in the middle of playing a video game. We found ZoneAlarm very good at recognizing and automatically including settings for our local network. In all our tests, the firewall guarded against all external and internal threats it encountered. ZoneAlarm is an excellent firewall choice for just about any average user.<br>  <br>  Go to: <a href="http://www.sumpter.org.uk/security/zonea..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sumpter.org.uk/security/zonea...</a> for information on how to install ZoneAlarm.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA10239227	u wil have to check it,go to control panel and get into ur security center,locate the firewall tab and u will see if is check.it will tell u firewall is on|`|0nUkK3XVaa	Do you mean installed? Well you will have a program running, a common one if Norton Internet Security, even though it is possible the worst out there it is very well know.

lJNrsQMTaa	Sim. Se reparar no conector USB do pendrive verá quatro vias. Duas delas s?o de transmiss?o de dados e as outras duas s?o de transmiss?o de energia. <br>  <br>  Mesmo que n?o esteja copiando nada para o pendrive as duas vias de energia continuam a alimenta-lo. Retira-lo abruptamente sem "parar" as vias de energia pode causar um curto no chip do pendrive ou en?o na porta USB do micro.

CTGHeMwPaa	Creating your own website:  Yes.   There are lots of free web hosts out there.    With your own domain name:  No.   There are real costs involved for the registration of domain names.   While they are usually not terribly expensive, they are not free.|`|Cxtdh5qYaa	http://www.papatiger.com offers free hosting (ad supported) if you purchase or transfer domain name to them.     They also provide a lot of free tools to create your site.    Recommended.|`|mKTFwaPCaa	Try the search on google for "free domain names".     Be warned - they may give you free domain + hosting, but it will be limited and prob have ads.|`|ra69rxxgaa	Godaddy.com has some free web building tools you can use when you buy a domain name from them. They charge about $10 for a .com domain.    also, there is no way to get your own domain name for free. Some sites offer subdomains for free, but not top level domains.    Top Level Domain:        something.com  Subdomain:                  yoursite.something.com|`|PB8X4Uklaa	I have not seen yet a true domain name offered free with the space,  there are lots of host which offer a web space for free but no domain, only subdomain  there are also some that if you buy the space from them, they will give you a free domain, but I have not seen any offering both together.  notice that you can get domains like .tk. or .co.cc for free|`|Z8oZGwE3aa	Send an email to e@culx.net for information on how to get a free .com, .net or .org domain name|`|uVz16qKFaa	No, a seperate domain will always cost money - whether you have to pay for a hosting/design plan or the domain itself.      The closest that you can get is a subdomain, which you can get for free. (i.e. www.somecompany.yourname.com)     You can get a free subdomain at http://www.webs.com.

UKCJrBjKaa	This is a very simple program that is very fun and amusing:    Do the following:  1)Open a blank programme  2)Make one command box (make sure it is called command1) size is not important  3)double click on it to view code option and in the top right hand corner of the white screen there is a scroll down menu  4) Go into this and search for 'mouse move'  5) Select that and in the new space provided copy the following code    Command1.Top = Int(Rnd * 10000)  Command1.Left = Int(Rnd * 10000)    Command1.Width = Int(Rnd * 2000)  Command1.Height = Int(Rnd * 5000)    6)Do not change the numbers these work the best by far  7)Change the caption of the command box to 'Click Me'  8) Find someone and get them to try and click the box, if you don't understand the code all it does is make it impossible to click on the box as it continously moves around    Have fun!|`|mxqAOxYRaa	Have fun|`|0S344Tefaa	You really want cool, try the inventory system that's cool or scholastic program it can improve your analytical think.

Then after that try PHP programming rather than VB6.|`|y9bwDc1taa	Make a GUI to try and find the killer's IP.|`|AA10519643	Not sure exactly what you are asking? Are wanting some creative ideas in order to enhance what you already know?     If you already have the concept of Visual Basic then why not venture into learning ADO.NET framework. This is really good for database creations and such. If that doesn't entice you then start learning ASP.NET which is mostly web pages and such.     Combining ADO.NET and ASP.NET as well as maybe getting JAVA to play nice with visual basic can be challenging.     Things you can make on a smaller scale create a database in Access maybe and use some VB coding to enhance it.     Make an application for cataloging movies, DVD's etc ..     Maybe research some and start learning to create your own game. There is so much start with looking a code snippets you can find on Microsofts web site and think about how you can expand it.     Pearl is another great coding that is open source. Why not tweak things that already exist and see how you can enhance that?     Do a google search on programmers for hire. There are so many websites out there where you can bid on projects that are needed by others for money. The cost to you? Nothing except your time to put the bid in.     Hope this helps and good luck|`|0ce61e573bbdf5eb6e91c386c28d01ddaa	When I was starting out, I liked to make simple games.  Tic-Tac-Toe is a good one.

You may be able to add it to your blogger page through Google Calendar by entering username etc. You will need a Google account for this (which you most likely have for blogger)    Good luck!

Get the Norton Corporate edition and it will be your friend.    Also Windows Defender can find it and kill it. Free off of Microsoft.com.   Also find Ad-Aware SE Personal. This will help you try to find it along with it. Saves me the brainwork ... also free.|`|0S344Tefaa	Actually, the problem is why you defragment your disk.

pDxFOekIaa	i dont think the recovery disk you make is the same thing you are thinking about.<br>  <br>  The recovery on a laptop is there because you dont get any windows disks when you buy the laptop, so your "disks" are saved on a partition.<br>  <br>  A recovery disk will not offer the same protection, and are actually useless and seem to be forgotten about in recent years.<br>  <br>  Partition the Hard drive – reasons<br>  ========================<br>  Firstly C drive is compulsory for the Operating System (XP) (Vista), and you install all your programs on C drive.<br>  <br>  D drive is made for YOUR files.<br>  <br>  What you do is MOVE my documents to D drive.<br>  <br>  When you download music, videos, pictures from your camera or make any MS Office documents or save emails, you save it on D drive.<br>  <br>  The reason for this is to do with <br>  1. Hard drive failure - usually a failed hard drive will not boot, but can often be seen when hooked up as a slave.<br>  So when you get your new hard drive up and running, you can copy D drive from your old to your new. You haven’t lost anything.<br>  <br>  2. Virus. Normally virus are programmed to infect C drive. If you get a bad virus all that has to be done is format the C drive partition then re install you OS and programs from disks.<br>  You haven’t lost your personal stuff because its on D drive.<br>  <br>  3. Scanning your C drive for virus or spyware. These malware programs live on C drive. It is not necessary to scan D drive. It is a lot quicker to scan a small partition than a large hard drive.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now you can see the above is compromised by the fact that programs get updates and lots of programs are installed from the net. Therefore if you had to wipe out C drive it be hard to get it back to how it was.<br>  To remedy this we use Norton Ghost to image C drive and store the Image on D drive.<br>  (Vista requires a version 10 or newer of Ghost).<br>  <br>  If you get a bad virus you just use the Ghost disk to boot up on, then copy the image stored on D drive back over C drive.<br>  It takes less than 30 mins to rebuild C drive.<br>  Also you may have this running on say a 250 gig HDD, and it fails.  You buy a new 400 gig HDD and install both into you computer, the failed one as a slave.<br>  Using the ghost disk to boot up on, you partition the 400 C drive to 30 gig (XP)and the remaining to D drive.  Then you repack C drive from the image.  Then Copy your old D drive files to your new one. In a time of less than 1 hour and it’s all running.  The image loads all the drivers, OS everything.<br>  <br>  Then you update new images of C drive every few months so that the one stored on D drive is not to far out of date.<br>  <br>  <br>  On XP and Vista you create C drive to a maximum of (XP 30 gig, Vista 40 Gig) It doesn’t need to be any bigger,  so don’t make C drive to big as you will not use it.<br>  Type DISKPART in windows help file<br>  also Disk manager.<br>  click the desktop, hit Fn1 key.<br>  <br>  Vista:<br>  <a href="http://www.lytebyte.com/2007/02/19/how-to-partition-in-windows-vista-extend-and-shrink/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lytebyte.com/2007/02/19/how-t...</a><br>  <br>  This is another point of view that is very interesting, where you would make C drive 10 gig (XP) or 15 gig(Vista) , make D drive for your programs (same size) then the rest as H or F drive for your files.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u_DHseKdu0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u_DHseKd...</a><br>  <br>  |`|alH9Tlahaa	It mirrors and copies your recovery drive, so that means everything will be just like you had when you started it for the first time.Steve|`|rc4DZWG4aa	recovery disk restores the settings what u had at the time of creating recovery disc. it will not restores ur computer back to settings what you had when u first got it.
km9cQNAXaa	You really only need 1 firewall but it should be the first thing an incoming signal sees.     You should disconnect the phone line while you are setting up the system. That way you are safe. Once the system is set up and you are happy that the firewall is working properly you can reconnect.

People can hack into wireless internet (wifi, wep encryption and some people can hack wpa and wpa2) your safest encryption would be vpn also hide your network. If you don't have wireless and you have a 1394 connection or direct connection you are less prone to be hacked. and you do not need wireless encryption. It seems like you are talking about a direct connection, you will need to get a Ethernet cable running from your wired (and wireless although not needed) router to the computer you are adding to the network. connect the router to the computer with internet access.|`|VbAm6N59aa	No you don't need to disable it.

w7fCw6WTaa	You can either use a BufferedReader or a Scanner to read a text file. Eg.<br>  <br>  BufferedReader b = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("filename.txt"));<br>  String line = b.readLine();<br>  while (line != null) {<br>  //split line into individual scores<br>  line = b.readLine();<br>  }<br>  <br>  You can split each line with a string tokeniser, remember you'll need to convert the tokens into numerical values. Oh yeah, and by 'line breaks' do you mean each set of scores are on a seperate line? Or they're all on a single line seperated by '\n'? If it's the latter then read in the single line and tokenise with '\n' as the criteria.|`|69bf306804b0f96dabbff07f7be09591aa	Easiest way to read the file line-by-line is to use the BufferedReader class.

Every time you call it, you get another complete line from the file.<br>  <br>  You have to be a little careful if you are mixing files between Unix/Linux and Windows, because the Unix text files will use just a newline (\n) as the line break character, and the Windows ones use \r\n. But this should get you started.|`|BfMvayWaaa	Assuming you have a File f<br>          Scanner scanner = new Scanner(f);<br>          while (scanner.hasNextInt()) {<br>              int nextInt = scanner.nextInt();<br>              System.out.println(nextInt);<br>          }<br>  the next int will auto skip over white space such as space or carriage return

3uLV7ohSaa	This is a somewhat confusing question.  Windows licenses don't expire.  Perhaps you mean that your trial period prior to activation ran out.<br>  <br>  As for your issue with not being able to boot to CD even when it allows you to see the screen where it says "Press any key to boot from CD" must be a communication issue between your keyboard and motherboard when not in windows.  I'm assuming that your keyboard is USB and legacy USB devices are disabled in the bios.<br>  <br>  Try entering the bios setup.  Normally it is the delete, f11, or f12 key on bootup.  You will see what it is on the bios screen.  Navigate to find where you can enable legacy USB support, enable it, save and exit.  You should be able to use it then.<br>  <br>  If you are only trying to update the key for Windows XP, you don't have to do any of this anyways.  Just enter the new key when it tells you that you can no longer use the prior one.

l2mbi5uBaa	I just bought the HP TX-1410us and am  overall very pleased with it especially considering the price. <br>  Since it seems you are concerned with processors, I usually choose pentium, but the amd that comes with this comp really has done great  getting the job done with every application i have put it through so far. Especially with the 250 gb hard drive and 2.2 dual core processor. The only problem would be if you were looking to use this as a gaming comp...while my older games run flawlessly..the newer ones lag ...definitely not a gaming computer...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|sqWiVT7Raa	wow, what a loaded question! In order to decide which cpu is better you need to understand that amd's operate at a lower speed because they are supposed to be a little more accurate at moving data, that is why they say 3000+ and clock at 1.8 ghz. For years I was an amd enthusiast but recently I am beginning to fall towards the dark side. The latest benchmarks have put Intel Pentium's at a higher benchmark than new amd's. So i would have to say go for a duo or even a quad core intel.

In the case that you are in a repressed dictatorship, but still want to check the news and weather, I like to use gladder for firefox. Its a simple plugin that has a button at the bottom of the browser- click, and you're viewing wiki in China. If that doesn;t do it, check into TOR. Tor requires a bit of work, and does slow down your network...but it works. The final option is tunneling.

If you're knew and have littel to no portfolio you'll probably need to charge pretty cheep like $200 to $400 for a 4 to 5 page site.    AS you get better, build up your portfolio, espcially if your design are really eye catching or you're doing advanced stuff that requires things like PHP, advance java scrip or flash then you could start charging around $1,000 for a 4 or 5 page site.    Irony is the better you get the more you can charge and the less time it will take you.|`|3LmXfFoBaa	100 dollars and up|`|ra69rxxgaa	It depends on what you feel you're worth. I charge $500-$1000 for a small website depending on the content and work involved.     Factors such as graphic design, flash animation, and such should also be factored into the job.     Make sure you outline exactly what you are doing for the amount they are paying. If the customer wants to add additional pages or content later, consider a monthly maintenance fee, or hourly fee for additional work.|`|UqUz2aASaa	It should depend on how complex the pages are and how long it will take to put them together.

Thats how I do my website design. One page could take a long time, don't sell yourself short.|`|xetVyGOdaa	To make a website you need to buy a domain name (www.whatever.com - couple of quid a year), then some web hosting (couple of quid a month), build some web pages (free) and upload them (free).    A starter hosting package from 123-reg.co.uk for example costs about 1.85 a month (whoever said 19.99 a month is nuts!), and a domain name costs about 2-3. All in it costs about 44.00 a year, and that's with the domain name yours for 2 years and including a one-off 9.99 set up fee, so the second year is cheaper (about 30). You can have far more than 5 pages on this too. Search around, there's even cheaper places than this, some give away free domain names with hosting and don't charge set up fees.      See http://www.freewebtutorial.co.uk for more help.|`|d8KnXFoLaa	about 19.99 a month|`|arE6NuOXaa	check out 1and1.com and they will fix you up for about 6 bucks per month     hotelclue  www.hotelclue.com|`|854662b4b6098e523f95f5d734db611eaa	When talking about "pages", we are often talking of "static pages" designed with an IDE (ie. Dreamweaver).  This means a site designed by an amateur (or beginner, or inexperienced developer).  The current value of these range between 10 and 15 $ per page.  Not even worth mentionning it... and certainly not a way to make a business!  IF, on the other hand, you can provide full AJAX interactivity, database and server side scripts, then, you are not talking of pages, but "applications", and the charge can be anything from a few hundreds to several thousands!  (A good basic e-commerce has an average value of 1500$.  I don't consider anything below 4500$)  Amateurs v Professionals, peanuts v decent living!
bnCiNAQdaa	are you using a PC-to-PC transfer, or did you take the HDD out of the laptop, put it in an enclsosure and try to connect it to the new one?    best bet is to use the PC-to-PC method, either thru the migration wizard or file and setting transfer.    the old HDD was set up with security permissions, either as an administrator or under the log in/user name. if the new laptop is configured under a different name, the old drive wont accept you as it doesnt "know" you.  try to log in as the Administrator, not a user with administrator rights.|`|UqUz2aASaa	I assume you must of had your home directory set as "private" on your laptop before you took the hard drive out.

AA10614086	Im not understanding were the switch is coming in use. You cant plug the two computers into a switch and a DSL modem. This is how your connections should be:    -Phone Line from wall to DSL Modem  -Ethernet cable from DSL Modem to PC1 Ethernet Port 1  -Crossover Ethernet Cable from PC1 ethernet port 2 to PC2 ethernet port 1    You will then need to Enable ICS on PC1 and configure the IP address on PC1 Ethernet port 2 to something like 192.168.1.10 and subnet 255.255.255.0    Now on PC2 configure it to access the internet through another computer and configure the IP address to something like 192.168.1.20 and subnet 255.255.255.0    Enable file and printer sharing on the two computers and make sure the workgroup name on the two computers are the same.    That should do it if you dont have firewalls installed.

Cracking anything tougher that a 128 WEP key is a highly technical and tedious process. Even if you do decide to go at it with backtrack or whatever... It isn't like..

XJSOToRGaa	These are harddrives.  Well for the first 3 the difference is the size (in terms of how much data you can store on them not, you know like, physical size).  5400 is the speed at which the platters in the HD spin - the higher the number, the quicker the read/write time on the drive.    The last is a solid state drive - this means its like a flash drive.  No moving parts.  Supposedly it allows faster read/write times but I haven't noticed a huge difference really...not enough to warrant the additional cost.  They do supposedly use less energy also and have less chance of failure owing to the lack of moving parts, but SSD is still a relatively new technology, so how long they will last still remains to be seen in my humble opinion.|`|zOtLK1BTaa	The "Serial ATA Drive" is a hard drive like you have in your current computer.

FbjRnvdAaa	I assume both your stacks have 6 books. if not then you can adjust all the numbers in the code below to suit your needs.    you will need 2 string arrays:    char * goodStack[] ={"book1", "book2", ... , "book6");  char * badStack[] = {"book1",...,"book6"};    to choose a different book from the list each time, you must keep the record of how many books you have already sold to him.  so you will need:  int goodBooks = 0;  int badBooks = 0;  then you could have a function that returns a book based on its arguments which is one of the stacks and the number of books already sold from that stack.   the function looks like:    char * getNextbook( char * stack, int soldNum)  {       return stack[soldNum];  }    two things to remember is that before you call this function with something like getNextbook(goodStack, goodBooks) you must check  to see if goodBooks is less than 6 and if it is not you know that you have exhausted your list.  Also remember that you must increment the number of books sold by 1 after you call this function.  so if it's from the goodStack do goodBooks++ and if it is the other stack do badBooks++    your program will know how to choose from the good stack or bad stack by you including an if statement that directs it to a function call to getNextBook(stack, books) with the right arguments. So if the user answers yes to the question about being liked by the owner, inside your if statement you will have getNextBook(goodStack, goodBooks) .  don't forget the check before the function and the increment after the function i mentioned above.    I assume you sell to the user only from one of the stacks so you will show him what he bought by calling the function below with the appropriate arguments.    void showSoldBooks(char * stack, int books)  {      for ( int i = 0; i       {          cout       }  }|`|EtWcrTvRaa	You need to look up how to use arrays and iterators, output stuff to the screen, man you need to take some noobie tutorials... or start listening in class.

5zSSGKBpaa	You have to check you bios and see if there is an option to boot from the usb in the boot order. The boot order determines in which order the computer looks for the boot device. If there is no option for usb in the boot order you cannot boot from the usb drive. There may be a bios update. Check the website site of your motherboard makers to see if they have one available. Do not upgrade the bios just because there is one available. Only upgrade if the upgrade offers something that you need.|`|F2XxqlVfaa	without knowing what kind of computer you have i cant tell you specifics on how to do it, but you can burn a boot image to usb (i would save all of your files on another media as it will get formatted) then change the boot menu, first boot device being usb instead of cd rom or hd whatever. then you should be able to boot.|`|c636938d4d9996522ca0e857f01c5d17aa	I don`t know absolutely about this USB business but I can only assume it is just like booting from a CD Where it runs the OS off off the USB device.    Go ahead and do it and I think you may still be able to copy your files without losing them, BEWARE the virus could spread through the copied files to the CD or hard drive you copy them too.    Also while you are re-installing XP you will be given an option for a system recovery. This will attempt to re-install XP without deleting your original files. You should try this first before going all the way and re-formatting your hard drive which will permanently destroy everything.|`|2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa	You can make a USB drive bootable as the first poster described,  You can also boot from a CD.

If there is no Sharing tab, don't worry!!  6) Highlight both Wireless Network Connection and Local Area Connection, right click, and Create Bridge. You should then notice your Wireless Network Connection drops down with the new Bridge Connection  7) The most important part now is to right click Local Area Connection and Add To Bridge.

2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa	If these are desktops, the real answer is neither... Just go with the less expensive system, and buy your own PCI-E video card.      While the 9500GT is a bottom-level gaming card and superior to the Radeon 3100 (which is just a consumer/business chipset), both fall well below the minimum level of performance that serious gamers want.    The 9600GT is twice as fast as the 9500GT, and doesn't cost much more.  Cards like the Radeon 4830 and GeForce 9800GT are only $20 more than the 9600GT, but even better by a considerable margin.    The graphics card is really the most important component in a gaming rig, so you'll want a midrange card at least.  A system with a $75 CPU and $150 graphics card easily outperforms a system with a $150 CPU and $75 graphics card.|`|mE3wNi8Raa	the radeon 3100 is an integrated graphics card which sucks,the 9500 is the better choice
iSB24uKYaa	Don't listen to the last answer that was posted...that just isn't nice.    Doesn't that dude/chick know that some people open myspaces to get in touch with their friends and meet new ones.    Your question isn't about logging in, it's about your layout.    1) are you sure you put a background pic link from a photo hosting site into the code    2) I don't think there are any 2.0 profiles that look like 1.0 (a 1.0 profile is a 1.0 profile and a 2.0 profile is a 2.0 profile.    3) I still use a 1.0 profile layout and it works fine...try revert back and see if other people can see your layout on a 1.0 profile.    4) are you sure you are not using a 1.0 layout on a 2.0 profile and a 2.0 on a 1.0 profile...that could be why it isn't working...the older layout is not compatible with the new profile and the 2.0 layouts don't work with the 1.0 profile.    5) don't listen to that "laughing" jerk!  He probably thinks that computers ruin human interaction judging by what he said.|`|AA12074783	If your MySpace account won't log in, here are some simple steps you should take:    1) Reboot your computer.  2) Get down on your knees and thank God.  3) Never go back on MySpace again.  4) Trust me, it's better this way in the long run.  5) Go call your friends that really matter, and don't worry about the 500 people that you only know because of MySpace anyway.  Good luck!  :-)

I use it on one of my computers and have really been pleased.  For what it's worth, I use Agnitum's Outpost Security Suite Pro on the other computer, and it is a full-service protection suite that I admire greatly.  It is simply outstanding.  I use the free service on my old unit because it is still running Windows Me, which is not supported by the newer Outpost, and the old version does not have the full anti-virus protection.<br>  <br>                Anyway, the free services provided by AOL and Yahoo! and other email providers does not protect your whole system from everything that comes at it.  They are there to scan the email through those services only.  Hotmail, I think, still uses McAfee, but the same caveat applies.<br>  <br>              AVG is excellent and free.  And don't forget to use something to prevent or at least catch spyware.  A good firewall is also important.  There are free versions of a lot of protection available, so just do a good search and you will find it.<br>  <br>             Here is a link to some good free anti-spyware programs:<br>  <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/collection/collid,1347-order,1-c,downloads/files.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/collect...</a><br>  <br>            Here is a link to info on free firewalls.

I have also used Norton from Symantec and found that to be over the top and it didn't sync with windows firewall too well and wasn't as user friendly as AVG.|`|fIVFzOPAaa	Grisoft provide AVG Free.  Been using it for years and works perfectly.<br>  Go to www.grisoft.com and look for free version.|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	I have used AVG Anti Virus, Zone Alarm Firewall, Spy-bot Search and Destroy a spyware killer for years. I have recently added superantispyware. They are all free for personal use and I have had no trouble with Viruses Trojans Hackers etc. I have just upgraded to AVG free 8.0 and all seems good so far. Zone Alarm allows a lot of personal configuration unlike the Windows Firewall. They can all be downloaded from <a href="http://www.download.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/</a> I also use Windows Defender from the Microsoft site. It is safe to use two anti-spy products but never use more than one A/V as it can cause conflicts. You should run A/V and anti spy weekly. Hope this helps|`|tWxwIPkVaa	AOL had a bad run a while ago, but I think they are OK now.

T0uagtmoaa	First off I hate Windows or anything associated with Microsoft Junk.  But you need to do full system scan, when you turn it off for a few minutes scan your computer and walk away it takes a while.  It should fix problems with your file system that may have been corrupted.  Furthermore when it boots you might want to do a full update and virus scan, defrag your hard drive, and clean up your temporary internet files this will make your system run a little more stable and faster.  Do not turn off your computer with the power switch turn it off the soft way.  The reason for this is Windows has to shut down all of the processes that are open, if one those processes happens to be writing to a critical system file when you turn it off it could screw up your Operating System, this is the reason for the scan.  If alls fails try doing a system restore, or just reinstalling all together.<br>  Good Luck.|`|KE8eGCoNaa	Try doing a system restore point prior a date in which it was working properly. Start type in system restore there choose a restore point or windows will choose one which recommends I recommend you to use the one windows recommends. |`|1NPVVxW0aa	Sounds lke you have a program, possibly part of windows, that isn't closing down before windows decides it's done and kills the power (or you do it manually).<br>  <br>  Are you saying that whatever you choose in the startup menu (safe mode, normal mode etc.) it doesn't boot from any choice until you power off with the switch and get the same menu?<br>  <br>  On the second boot you get the same menu but whatever you choose,  pressing a button loads windows in normal mode??<br>  <br>  That is extremely bizzarre if you described it right.<br>  <br>  You could press the Control - Alt- Delete keys when the laptop is failing to shutdown and see what programs are running or not responding. If none, look at the tasks and see if you can match up running tasks to a program.

Steve|`|QCoGoi7eaa	Sounds like you have a virus or spyware problem on your hands. Have you tried using web browsers other than the one you're using right now? Try several different antivirus programs and spyware detectors. Download the programs using an external downloader (like Flashget or Download Accelerator). Here's some URLs:<br>  <a href="http://download.softpedia.com/dl/9c2c8e8faeed62cad50cc4cdbfa6981a/4916ce50/100006527/software/antivirus/antivir_workstation_winu_en_h.exe" rel="nofollow">http://download.softpedia.com/dl/9c2c8e8...</a><br>  <a href="http://global.pcclear.com/download/softpedia/PCclearPlus_1.0.4.5.exe" rel="nofollow">http://global.pcclear.com/download/softp...</a><br>  <a href="http://files.avast.com/iavs4pro/setupeng.exe" rel="nofollow">http://files.avast.com/iavs4pro/setupeng...</a><br>  <a href="http://download.bitdefender.com/windows/desktop/free/final/en/bitdefender_free_v10.exe" rel="nofollow">http://download.bitdefender.com/windows/...</a><br>  <br>  If all else fails, I usually do this: <br>  1. When did you first notice the problem? <br>  2. When was the last time you surfed the net without this problem?<br>  3. Use Windows Search for all files created between these two periods. To confirm which files are the potential spyware, it will most likely be on the startup programs list, or the process list in Windows Task Manager.<br>  4. Delete the offending file. Be aware that it'll most likely have some other duplicates lying around in your hard drive. Remember to backup that file, just in case its something important<br>  <br>  Good luck

Vista presented problems on my mom's computer too, so she decided to change it to XP.  |`|1iL7S7zHaa	Okay, first of all, I hate internet explorer. It is full of endless amounts of popups and viruses and the like. What I suggest you do, is if you can, download mozilla firefox. If your IE will let you that is. Firefox is so much better as far as security and blocking popups, and, it's much faster. And you might want to invest in a decent anti-virus and anti-spyware program if you don't already have one. I use AVG Free and it works really well, with no viruses or spyware. Hopefully this helps you. |`|sylUy3draa	That happens all the time with Vista, I think certain sites are still working with it.
