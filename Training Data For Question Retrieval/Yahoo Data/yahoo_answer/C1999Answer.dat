EMmGFqgJaa	I searched in google and of right now an unmodded Wii does NOT take SDHC cards. If you mod a wii and add homebrew to the Wii then the homebrew does recognize SDHC cards.<br>  <br>  The Wii can only take a SD card up to 2GB. The Wii can be updated to take SDHC but that has not happened yet.|`|wp8ocMCtaa	Yep, to the left of the disk slot there is a pull up flap which underneath contains the "SYNC" button and the SD slot.<br>  Hope I helped =)|`|EpvHhbByaa	No, the wii can only accept 2GB SD cards. However if you want you could use one of those rare 4GB non-SDHC cards. All you have to do is trick your wii into thinking it's a 2GB SD card by filling it up with 2GB of dummy files, and once you've reached max compacity, you could delete those dummy files and gain another 2GB without having to change SD cards. Also copying speed is faster on the 4GB cards.<br>  <br>  If you want more info on it, just google it.

H40987QIaa	It doesn't look like the sales figures are public.  In the first 6 weeks 1.6 million copies were sold for the xbox 360.  It's definitely in the millions for PC sales.  But I don't really know for sure.  I can say as far as the game goes that I was very dissapointed.  I think I have extremely high expectations.  I care more for solid game play than great graphics.<br>  In reality, in 3 - 5 years the graphics of a game like mass effect won't mean shiz.  The only thing that will matter is the beauty of it's game play and replay value and I think that it really fell short on that front.  The story was extremely short and flat.  There wasn't really any surprise until it was over, as in, *shock* it's over already, I hope you enjoyed those 20 hours, we enjoy your money.|`|ijHQW3b3aa	<a href="http://4fun.eniac.at" rel="nofollow">http://4fun.eniac.at</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.
HAletyh8aa	Okay. First of all... to dial out of Guam/US you use 011.<br>  011 is the international code that the US uses to dial outside of the US.<br>  <br>  Basically... just dial 011+ 061+ 089-965-####. <br>  OR sometimes its 011 + 61 + 089-965-####.<br>  <br>  The 61 is Australia's country code.<br>  Many times, they do not require a zero in front of the country code. <br>  (US's country code is 1.

42tTsVuxaa	Deciding on format is important, <br>  <br>  HDD and Media cards, HDD cameras use a hard drive to store the video, it is in a compressed format, capacities range from 30GB up the amount of video (hours) depends on 1 size of drive, 2 how much you compress the information the more the compression the higher reduction in quality. You do need a good performing computer to edit the created video. many of the editing packages allow you to do this, but some you need to convert to a format that they will accept. <br>  <br>  Once the HDD camera's drive is full then you are stuck unless you either record over the original video or you move the video to your computer. <br>  Media cards (SD SONY) you can just put another card in to your camera. <br>  On the lowest compression settings the results are good-excellent. on the highest lets just say its not that good. <br>  <br>  Forget DVD at best quality only 20 min's ish recording times, maybe a little more, if you read other questions there are many problems with them. <br>  If you are going to "post"  your videos then the quality does not have to be the best. <br>  <br>  try this link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cnet.com.au/camcorders/camcorders/0,239035915,240061716,00.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnet.com.au/camcorders/camcor...</a><br>  <br>  There are a number available in your price range. go into a store and check them out, find something that feels good to you, and has features that you think is important.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  RR|`|vumO06qFaa	I suggest ..

SKkE3fK1aa	Ok, please take time to read my answer, I'll explain as thoroughly as I can.<br>  <br>  First of all, the N85 is newer than the N95. The N95 is released in March 2007 while the N85 is released October 2008.<br>  <br>  The both have stereo speakers (2 speakers) with a 3.5 mm jack for headsets and other enhancements (like TV-Out, etc.). Both of them have the 5 Megapixel camera with Autofocus and LED Flash and the secondary VGA Camera for video calling. Both of them actually has the same features like Email (POP3 and IMAP4), HTML Browser with Flash Lite, Productivity Apps for Word PowerPoint and Excel including Adobe Reader for PDF files. Also, both of them have a Dual Slide design, but the N85 is more integrated with Web/Internet (the dual slide is for zooming). The N95 and N85 has the accelerometer support but the N85 has autorotation while the N95's accelerometer is used for positioning camera images.<br>  <br>  Here's where things get messy. The OS (operating system) of the N95 is Symbian OS 9.2 (Nokia Series 60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 1) while the OS of N85 is Symbian OS 9.3 (Nokia Series 60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 2). The difference with 9.2 and 9.3 is their connectivity. 9.3 is more intact with OVI network (it's nokia's 'myspace' service) and more built-in apps for internet usage. But, that doesn't mean that the N95 does not have features, if you update your N95's firmware to the latest, then you'd get the same features counterpart to the 9.3's. Anyway, as for memory, the N95 has a Dual Core ARM11 (369 MHZ) processor while the N85 typically has a Solo Core ARM11 (the same processor). I'd recommend you get the Dual Core one since its better to have a phone that can process your applications faster than getting angry at super slow speeds. Remember me saying that the N85 is for web? Well, it has a touch-sensitive Navigation Wheel (kinda like the mouse wheel) in order for you to scroll your web pages down.<br>  <br>  Here's something else. The N95 has a video card (3D Graphics Accelerator)! The N95 is perfect for Games (not the Java Games one). Although the N85 and N95 are compatible with N-Gage 2.0 (nokia's gaming platform that's unique!), the N95 is BUILT for it as it has the video card and the dual-core processor.<br>  <br>  Conclusion: The N95 is for Multimedia (games, images, video, music) while the N85 is for internet browsing. Both of them are also for productivity (email, document viewing, weather forecasts, etc.).<br>  <br>  >>> I would just like to remind you, that even the best smartphones are useless without applications!|`|6GB5P7ojaa	N85 is newer than the N95.

AbRfd29Haa	These days, I would go LCD for smaller TVs, or if you must have flat panel, and DLP for something large (I have a 71" DLP).<br>  <br>  Plasmas have a few issues. One is power.. they suck about twice the power of anything else. A plasma display is made up of tiny cells, one for each subpixel (about 6 million on a full HD display). Each cell is full of a gas heated to plasma, which is used to excite phosphors, rather than the electron beam of the old analog displays (CRT). <br>  <br>  This was initially a good thing, because it was a way to make a digital display using what we knew already: phosphor. So a plasma gives you the same 10,000:1 contrast as you get with CRT, more or less. But they have the same flaws as CRTs -- they can burn in (window or letter boxing, logos, etc) and have a relatively short life, though it's much improved (early plasmas were only good for a few thousand hours before they lost significant brightness). Due to the need for plasmas to be kept hot, they suck power and also don't give you a really black black. <br>  <br>  LCDs used to suffer from a number of things: low contrast (somewhere in the 500:1 to 1000:1 range), slow updates, small panels, and restricted viewing angles. But at least in good modern displays, all of these things have been solved. You can get 50"+ LCD panels, with contrast of 20,000:1 or more, with screen refresh fast enough to match the 120Hz/3D-ready stuff that went standard in just about all DLPs last year (natually, since I had bought mine in 2007). The backlight on an LCD panel (LCDs don't make their own light) is usually an electroluminescent (EL) light, with a lifetime in excess of 50,000 hours. Some smaller displays may be using LEDs, which last even longer, but do watch out for these, make sure they're bright enough for you. <br>  <br>  So for pretty much any flat panel today, I would go LCD. But do shop around... not every LCD on the market has all the latest features.<br>  <br>  When I shopped for my DLP, I was fairly sure that DLP compared in quality to Plasma, if not exceeded it at the time, but I did my homework. I did direct comparisons in-store between DLP, Plasma, and LCoS (another rear projection microdisplay technology), and found that, for the top-end stuff, there was essentially no difference.. and it was usually the limited by the material, not the TV. Of course, when you're looking at 65"+ TVs in 2007, it's all top-end, no cheap stuff. <br>  <br>  And you might bring your own refrence material. The Blu-Rays of the day were pretty weak.. I saw more in compression artifacts than I did in meaningful differences between TVs, as mentioned... 50GB Blu-Ray with AVC or VC-1 video was slower getting to market. Also, bring a good reference disc for dark scenes... "Star Wars III" is a good one, jump to the battle scene between Obi-Wan and Anakin/Vader, around all that lava. Also, go to a store (if possible) that actually adjusts their TVs properly... that's a tall order, but you can least ask (if they say "yes", ask which reference disc they use for adjustments... watch the reaction for lies or confusion).|`|yrQFXxcXaa	Well the truth is that plasma tv's don't last as long as an lcd tv,plus a plasma tv is alot more expensive than an lcd tv & you cannot tell the difference in picture quality whatsoever as they are Identical I own a plasma HDTV & an LCD  HDTV, if I was going to buy another HDTv it would be an LCD as plasmas are really heavy & eat the electric like pacman.|`|uF7yiB5laa	When I purchased ny last TV I was strongly advised to buy LCD, something about images will actually burn on plasma.

VJ1C5JsYaa	No The three main purposes for installing a game to the HD is:<br>  <br>  1. The system will not get as hot during play. Since the disc is not spinning in the tray the power and friction used and created from the disc is eliminated. This helps protect your system from overheating and getting the RRoD<br>  <br>  2. The second purpose is so that when playing games you wait less. Information stored on the HD is easyer for the system to access then from a CD this reduced the load times in most games. While you may not notice it they are reduced. The only game this does not apply to is Halo 3. This game will run slower if installed to the HD.<br>  <br>  3. The system does not run as loud. With no disc spinning the system is no at loud. Simple as that.<br>  <br>  Also of course you will need to have the Disc in the system to play. Did you honestly think you would not need the disc? If that was the case who would buy games anymore? Once people had the game once they would never keep it.They might rent it then never buy it. No income for the game company means no more games. This would be the stupidest thing ever done if that was the case. Would you own a company make thousands of copy's of something and be able to stay in business if only 1 or 2 copy's actually got sold?|`|wIM3vNtwaa	No they can't, it still asks for the disc to prove that you have and own the game to prevent piracy (like a PC does)|`|9AR6B4ELaa	the others are right, the disc must be inside the xbox. the option copy means that you copy some files from the disc to the hardd rive to make the game run faster and smoother|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	Nope-original disc still must be in the machine.<br>  <br>  Although- the Dreamcast made a similar mistake. The DVD format games came out right after the first affordable DVD burners hit the market. PPL bought the system, but no games because they'd run off to Blockbuster, copy the game and return it. Brand new games for 5$ each.|`|8146e347ad7537c819ea87c18358a194aa	- You have to have the disc to play the game even though its on your hard drive.<br>  - Installing a game to your hard drive is to improve load times and overall speed the game up.|`|AQ1136a2aa	The original disk must be in the xbox|`|3HmO1EBcaa	I thought that at first, but it says you have to insert the disc first to prove that you have/or renting the game. All it does it stop some lag in certain games. Like for example Fallout3...Its a really good game but it does have some long loading spots, and lag spots. Downloading the game lowers down loading time and lag spots in games.

6GB5P7ojaa	Oh, wow! This is awesome! My birthday is on May, too! I'm turning 13 this year. *ahem* Anyway, moving on with my answer.<br>  <br>  I would rather get the iPod Touch if I were you. It will give you everything the iPhone has except the iPhone's phone functions. They are basically the same. Get the iPod Touch because it will give you what you know you'll get. It will be able to use apps from the App Store just like the iPhone, it will be able to open Audiobooks just like the iPhone and much more. You do have a point with watching movies on a tiny screen. Don't even get me started with all the flaws of the iPhone!!! Bottom line is that the iPhone is VERY FAR from being a phone and it is not worth the $200-300+ expense. The iPod Touch is worth the money you're spending, though. Be careful of firmware updates and apps. Some apps are just for the iPhone and some updates are just for the iPhone.<br>  <br>  Take note that buying these Apple products will be a hassle. You'll have to back it up, sync it, jailbreak it (if you have to), unlock it (if you don't like AT&T) and the like.<br>  <br>  An 8GB iPod touch can hold up to 1,750 songs, 3,500 with 16GB and 7,000 with 32GB.<br>  <br>  The iPod Touch is worth it, the iPhone is not.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!<br>  Good luck!|`|l7Q5tCpbaa	they are basically the same.

YKc3YrxXaa	Yea, the same exact thing happened to me the other day and I completely freaked out too. I WAS able to get it back to work though. Keep reading please. First, I reset the PS3 controller using a really small pin. The reset can be found at the back of the controller. The lights immediately started flashing. The battery was low, and I found out why: my cable wasn't charging. So I tried the USB cable that came with my SONY Cybershot camera and it started charging again and I was playing my PS3 again. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|CckCvJpyaa	Maybe its got hardly any battery life left in it try charging it up for about twenty minutes without playing and see if it works then, if it still doesnt work try taking it to an electronics shop and if they cant fix it then there is no other choice than to buy a new one, if your new one doesnt work then either your recharger is broken or your ps3 is broken, hope i have helped.|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	Maybe you left it on continuously and it's battery has been drained (it has a 30 hour battery life per charge). Charge it for 2 hours and then see what happens.|`|TmDabvoIaa	you sure it's charged up ok?<br>  leave it hooked up via the USB for 10-15 mins and try again.<br>  Maybe you shouldn't leave it lying around...|`|YZuEgUTqaa	* Try using it when it is fully charged <br>  * (Is there a PS3 next door to you - if there is you could be connecting to    <br>     that one.)|`|TOkoHXRFaa	Kick it or something the original six-axis controllers are terribly made and are rubbish!|`|kwYSKXaJaa	Try connecting the USB to your PC/MAC and then to your controller<br>  <br>  This has happened to me<br>  <br>  If it doesn't start flashing red (the thing to show you which slot it is as, 1,2,3 or 4) then turn off your PS3 by holding the on button on the actual PS3 until you hear a beep or two, then plug the USB into the ps3 and the controller to the USB, then turn your PS3 on by clicking the ps button, if it still doesn't work, take it to game or gamestation and they will try it on their PS3 in shop for a fiver

TwIK4Ivlaa	Use a linux live disk (like knoppix) and boot using the disc. When your desktop is loaded, just copy the files to another folder on your hard disc, one by one. Make sure to copy only the picture files.<br>  <br>  You'll have to edit some files (fstab located in /etc folder) in order to permit writing of files to the hard disc. Search on internet for more information. If you have a USB flash drive, then format it to FAT / FAT32 and directly write to it from knoppix.<br>  <br>  If you can't open the files using knoppix, try to recover them using some recovery program. I prefer Sandisk Rescue Pro on Windows. <br>  <br>  Do not let the virus scanner automatically 'heal' or 'cure' the virus, it can lead to deletion of some very important files or even folder.<br>  <br>  If you are still daring to risk more for the photos, just note down the files that have virus and then switch off the real-time scanner and then save only the photo files. Later re-activate the real time scanner. (This method is not recommended and can cause damage to your computer depending on the virus).|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	go to yahoo search<br>  type photo rescue

AbRfd29Haa	You had it right, all the way up to "not to fussed on the quality, probably around 7 megapixels"... if you don't plan to use this for still images, you really don't care much about megapixels.<br>  <br>  For video, there are essentially two formats: SD (standard definition) and HD (high definition). SD is 720x480 (NTSC), HD comes in a few flavors: 1280x720, 1440x1080, 1920x1080. That's a maximum of just around 2 megapixels. An HD camera with a single 2+ megapixel sensor looks pretty good... some HD camera use three smaller sensors to deliver a decent picture, too. In SD, you get better color with either three 1/3 megapixels sensors or a higher resolution single sensor.. but there's zero reason to look for anything much over 1.5-2.0 megapixels for video work. <br>  <br>  And there's the downside.. the more pixels you fit into a sensor of the same size (a good consumer camcorder will have a 1/3" or slightly larger sensor, many have tiny 1/6" sensors), the less sensitive each pixel becomes. Which means, your low-light performance goes to crap. <br>  <br>  For $400-ish, you might find an older model HDV camcorder on sale, but you're largely talking standard definition. HDV can be preferable even if you're shooting for something standard like DVD... downsized HDV shot with a consumer camera can rival some of the best SD shot with pro cameras, at least where light isn't a problem. All HD camcorders can also shoot directly in SD, too. <br>  <br>  Canon makes a number you should consider. The Canon HV20 is an older HDV (tape) based HD camcorder, generally considered the best consumer camcorder when it was introduced. I found one on Amazon, refurbished, for $440<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-HV20-Definition-Camcorder-Stabilized/dp/B000MUV6BA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1236443507&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Canon-HV20-Definit...</a><br>  (look at the "New & Used link). You occasionally see these new for under $500, but there are newer models available... also excellent, but out of your price range. This is HDV tape, which is kind of going out of fashion in the consumer market (computer media, flash, HDD, or DVD, is easier to work with for most people), but gives you better quality than all but the very latest AVCHD camcorders. <br>  <br>  You might want to look here:<br>  <a href="http://www.camcorderinfo.com/content/Camcorderinfo-com-Select-Awards-2008-35688.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.camcorderinfo.com/content/Cam...</a><br>  <br>  Camcorderinfo.com consistently produces the best on-line (and often, best anywhere) in-depth reviews of popular camcorder models. You can look over the details and decide what's important to you and what isn't. The link above references their picks based on 2008 models, so it's fairly current. <br>  <br>  You are correct in demanding an external mic input.. built-in mics are drek, even on high-end camcorders. Unfortunately, this seems to be considered a high-end feature these days, so there are not many SD camcorders that still offer mic-in jacks. One decent option is the Canon FS11 (or the cheaper but similar FS10 or FS100), check it out here:<br>  <a href="http://www.camcorderinfo.com/content/Canon-FS11-Camcorder-Review-35203.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.camcorderinfo.com/content/Can...</a><br>  <br>  This is flash-based, which I think is the best overall format for tapeless models these days -- flash cards are cheap, durable, and replaceable.

Then copied these pictures to a memory card and could view them on my camera or show on TV.<br>    <br>  If your computer has memory card slots, find the correct slot and copy pictures from the memory card to the computer.<br>   <br>  If there are no memory card slots on your computer that work with your memory card, purchase a Targus card reader at Walmart for $8.88 or another brand for less at Ritz/Wolf/Kit camera.  Also, they do 3? x 5" digital prints for 6￠ each on Tuesday and Wednesday.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged, format in camera, and don't delete or fill card completely.  Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.<br>   <br>  After you have the memory card plugged in, go to My Computer and open the memory card, select the picture you want to copy, and then copy to the My Pictures folder under My Documents under Documents and Settings.<br>   <br>  If you have trouble with this, it may be easier to right click on Start and then left click Explore. Find and select the picture you want to copy and then at top left, click the X next to Folders to see a place to select Copy Files.  Now select the My Picture folder.  Make and select a sub folder then click Copy.<br>   <br>   <br>  You can also copy from the computer to a memory card. <br>   <br>  Have just been playing with this and found that it works really well, but you should first format the memory card in the camera because it adds files to the card you will need.<br>   <br>  Next, take a picture of something with the camera.<br>   <br>  Place the memory card in the card reader and go to My Computer. <br>   <br>  Open the memory card and you should see a folder on the left (DCIM) that has your picture. Do not open the MISC folder on the right.<br>   <br>  Double Click on the DCIM folder and you should see another folder e.g.,100HPM417, which includes the name of your camera.  Double Click on that folder and you should see the picture you just took.<br>   <br>  When you copy from the computer to a memory card, that is the folder where your pictures must be copied. You may only be able to copy one picture at a time.<br>   <br>  One last thing, the file names of your pictures must not have any additional letters or those pictures will not be seen by the camera.  Also, the file name format must match the file name of the picture you took e.g., HPIM1903.  Rename files to the same format as your camera photos.<br>   <br>  If you have trouble with this, it may be easier to right click on Start and then left click Explore. Find and select the pictures you want to copy and then near the top left, click the X next to Folders to see a place to select Copy files.

JzxS4jBDaa	That happens to me sometimes. You can try restarting your computer (since restarting iTunes prolly won't help). If that doesn't work, then just wait until 2moro. I usually get those errors when they screw the iTunes store up. It's technology, so there are gonna be some problems.<br>  <br>  But I suggest not waiting until the 2.3 firmware. In the sources are the features of 2.2 firmware. And the other day, 2.2.1 (I think) came out, making Safari and Mail waaay more stable. (And it fixed the ability of saving pictures from the web/mail to a temp. photo folder on your iPod.)<br>  <br>  But don't worry; the connection is NOT YOUR FAULT. It's iTunes ability to connect to you, not the other way around. Anyway it is, it's Apple's fault. But hopefully it should be totally fixed for you by 2moro. Good luck.~|`|wdgrsn86aa	actually a lot of people dnt want 2.2 well yeah 1.1.4 is better too u get alot of games<br>  and the home wallpaper that iw ant so much but its harder for me to get it again|`|oj6x65s1aa	mine was doing the same thing!<br>  i went to the apple store, and they put it on, but then my ipod got messed up and i had to restore it. i lost everything except a few apps and saved photos.<br>  my advice: wait until 2.3. all this one does is make a few changes ot the app store, its nothing important. trust me.

Your carrier is assisting your GPS to make a faster data calculation.The carrier has many BTS cell (those are up in towers) which has a gps receiver and countinously pulling down satellite informations and then pass it to your A-Gps through the data connection every time it requested by the GPS.The result is a faster time your gps pinpointed the actual position,rather than GPS w/o assistance.However,using offline map will reduce your cost of data conection.The bad thing is there is NO way to make the assistance Disable.<br>  This site guide us to find some gps resources,maybe one of them give advantages for you <a href="http://www.maps-gps-info.com/fgpfwmobile.html#Java" rel="nofollow">http://www.maps-gps-info.com/fgpfwmobile...</a>

Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.<br>  <br>  The following information describes a better way to move/copy photos to and from a computer and memory card.<br>   <br>  Just received some pictures in an e-mail which I moved to the computer.  Then copied these pictures to a memory card and could view them on my camera or show on TV.<br>    <br>  If your computer has memory card slots, find the correct slot and copy pictures from the memory card to the computer.<br>   <br>  If there are no memory card slots on your computer that work with your memory card, purchase a Targus card reader at Walmart for $8.88 or another brand for less at Ritz/Wolf/Kit camera.  Also, they do 3? x 5" digital prints for 6￠ each on Tuesday and Wednesday.<br>   <br>  After you have the memory card plugged in, go to My Computer and open the memory card, select the picture you want to copy, and then copy to the My Pictures folder under My Documents under Documents and Settings.<br>   <br>  If you have trouble with this, it may be easier to right click on Start and then left click Explore. Find and select the picture you want to copy and then at top left, click the X next to Folders to see a place to select Copy Files.  Now select the My Picture folder.  Make and select a sub folder then click Copy.<br>   <br>   <br>  You can also copy from the computer to a memory card. <br>   <br>  Have just been playing with this and found that it works really well, but you should first format the memory card in the camera because it adds files to the card you will need.<br>   <br>  Next, take a picture of something with the camera.<br>   <br>  Place the memory card in the card reader and go to My Computer. <br>   <br>  Open the memory card and you should see a folder on the left (DCIM) that has your picture. Do not open the MISC folder on the right.<br>   <br>  Double Click on the DCIM folder and you should see another folder e.g.,100HPM417, which includes the name of your camera.  Double Click on that folder and you should see the picture you just took.<br>   <br>  When you copy from the computer to a memory card, that is the folder where your pictures must be copied. You may only be able to copy one picture at a time.<br>   <br>  One last thing, the file names of your pictures must not have any additional letters or those pictures will not be seen by the camera.  Also, the file name format must match the file name of the picture you took e.g., HPIM1903.  Rename files to the same format as your camera photos.<br>   <br>  If you have trouble with this, it may be easier to right click on Start and then left click Explore. Find and select the pictures you want to copy and then near the top left, click the X next to Folders to see a place to select Copy files.

These pictures were about half the width of my 3MP pictures on the camera card which had been formatted.  The old pictures were still there on both sides of the 1.2MP I-phone pictures.<br>   <br>  Formatting a memory card starts a new File Allocation Table.  Pictures are not removed from memory cards with delete or format.  When old pictures are replaced with new pictures then the old pictures are really gone.<br>   <br>  When pictures have been deleted or memory cards have been formatted, a memory card reader will be needed to recover the pictures.  <br>   <br>  If there are no memory card slots on your computer that work with your memory card, purchase a Targus card reader at Walmart for $8.88 or another brand for less at Ritz/Wolf/Kit camera.

Many times, a tech there can help you. <br>  <br>  I purchased my phone at Radio Shack,and when something strange is going on with the phone, I take it to Radio Shack and they tell me how to fix the problem.

Oh and LG is good, because no matter how many times you drop it (I wouldn't recommend dropping it though), none of the functions would be spoilt. There might be scratches and such though. At least that was my experience with my two LG phones. I'm thinking of getting the LG KF350 too (=

Get Sonic and the secret rings. It has a great storyline, lots of fun minigames (perfect for parties), Cool bosses and beautifully made stages.<br>  Downside: the sideways controls are slightly annoying, some missions are difficult to beat, and its a automatic-run thing.<br>  <br>  Do you....<br>     Enjoy more of a do whatever in whatever order i choose type of game?  then get Sonic unleashed.  Once again, great storyline, BEAUTIFUL cutscenes, lots of stages, levels, and missions to play, the graphics say wow. The daytime stages are the pride of the game, it gives you an idea of how fast sonic goes, (really flippin fast).  The werehog recieved bad reviews but i still think it is REALLY fun beating up stuff.<br>  Downside: The werehog stages are sometimes tedious, almost like a chore on some level. (you can beat up so many bad guys before you get tired) and there is no shadow or knuckles in the game, (that counts as a downside, right?)

9MZwq04laa	try the government site for different features on converters<br>  www.dtv.gov<br>  Those listed here must meet minimum specs to be listed. I have used Insignia,RCA and Micro Gem brands and would recommend RCA and Insignia as VERY easy to use.<br>  Please give us more info on just how you plan to use this and we can be of more help. (with a VCR, only once a week,etc)<br>  You will see lots of off brands that you have never heard of. I would suggest to get one that has a remote with a solid look and feel. You will want to get one solid enough to last a good while. Universal remotes are scrambling to include codes for converter boxes and the off brands may not be listed for some time.

3CJAUyqPaa	The tape drive mechanism in MiniDV tape based cams can only deal with MiniDV tape. Digital8, Hi8 VHS-c tapes will not fit. HOWEVER, there are a few miniDV tape based camcorders with a feature called "AV Passthrough". Using the AV cable that came with the Digital8, Hi8 VHS-c tape or other camcorder along with the AV cable of the miniDV tpae based camcorder with "AV Passthrough" and you should be able to connect the miniDV camcorder's DV port to the computer and import video from the older camcorder.<br>  <br>  You said: "my old digital8 sony handycam is not compatible with my Windows Vista". I may be off base here, but it is Vista that is the culprit - and I believe you can still get stuff working, though there be a small expense... and, you did not tell us which computer hardware platform you are using, but here goes...<br>  <br>  ALL Sony Digital8 camcorders have a DV port. It is a 4-pin firewire port. If your computer has a working firewire port, then you should be able to import the DV-format video from that Digital-8 camcorder (along with analog Hi8 video, too. I suspect you previously transferred video from that camcorder using USB streaming - this is a low-quality video stream. Using Firewire will also improve your video quality over the USB streaming version.<br>  <br>  Firewire, IEEE1394, DV and i.LINK are all the same thing - and they are not USB. The USB drivers that supported USB streaming prior to Vista have not been supported and getitng them to work in Vista has been hit and miss.<br>  <br>  My Sony HDR-FX1 has AV-passthrough... but I don't think you need that capability.

Stole my cell phone wallet and a few other things.<br>  First off, let your phone provider know immediately, that it is stolen, and sadly buy a new one. If you have a set up, where you have a long contract with the company, you have to put a stop on those calls, as soon as you can.<br>  See if you can get insurance, for having a cell phone replaced, seeing this is the second time for you.<br>  I just hope you didn't have any personal information on it, that they can use. Next phone, although it may be a pain, set it up with a password lock. So even if the steal it, they won't be able to use it.

Also, their lower end is generally cheaper and sound much, much better.<br>  <br>  I own Senn HD-280s and I love the sound quality, never really heard skullcandies.

e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	First, nobody forced you to buy a converter box.  If you subscribe to cable to satellite, you won't need a converter.  If you want to watch your local channels with an antenna you can buy a converter box or get a new TV that has a digital tuner in it but certainly the converter box will be far cheaper than a digital TV.  <br>  The digital transmission system will save a lot of RF spectrum that can be used for public safety or other services.  It will also give you more programming choices as the digital transmissions support more capacity.  A single TV station can have 4 separate broadcasting streams, meaning 4 separate programs being sent at the same time.  You won't just have a channel 6, you could have a 6-1, 6-2, 6-3, and6-4.  Each 6-x can have a different program.  It depends on what the TV station wants to do with this capacity.|`|UgFntgI9aa	They did it so the analog tv bandwidth could be used for other things.  <br>  <br>  Like for example your local fire and police departments will probably be using it for various communications they'd like to have.  <br>  <br>  I've also heard they intended to sell parts of it.  So yeah making money is part of the deal.  <br>  <br>  I don't know why anyone cares.  If you're cheap you can get a converter for 40 bucks, and for the trouble of filling out a form the government will pay you back for it.  <br>  <br>  And the picture's better.

myq34zlHaa	There are good reasons to use or not use a UV filter.  <br>  <br>  If the lens is dropped, a filter may save your lens.  It will also protect the lens from any other accidental scratches or marks on the glass (and even a very good filter is much cheaper than an 18-200VR).<br>  <br>  On the other hand, a lens hood will also likely save your lens in the case of droppage, and also keeps things away from the glass, and has the added benefit of acting as, well, a lens hood & minimizing lens flare.  The other thing is, no matter how good a filter you get, any piece of glass in front of your lens is going to reduce the quality of the lens by a fraction.  The better the filter, the smaller that fraction is, but nothing will ever look exactly as good as a lens without a filter.  It's just the nature of glass, no glass transmits exactly, perfectly, 100% of the light that hits it.  So some people argue, why spend all that money on a good lens if you're going to put something on top of it?<br>  <br>  And it takes a 72mm filter.|`|lQao8Wt0aa	I'd recommend a filter whether you shoot outdoors or not - to protect the front of the lens.  If you drop it, or bump the front, the filter will protect the threads of the lens, and will dissipate some of the destruction.  That lens uses a 72mm filter - most are around $25, Tiffen, Canon, and Hoya all make better than needed quality filters.

LnYr2dLfaa	Controller:<br>  How old is your controller? Is it still in warranty? Has it been acting up during game play? If it's still in warranty then send it to the company that made it (MS if it's an official controller) and they should send you a new one. If it's out of warranty then sometimes Gamestop do repairs (costs a bit, though).<br>  <br>  Console:<br>  It could just be the type of console (Arcade, Elite etc.) so if you and your friend's console is different then that could be the problem. If your console has the Red Ring of Death that could also be the problem.<br>  <br>  Headset:<br>  It could just be the headset. Sometimes (as said before) they are only compatible with certain console types. I know my friend's headset is only compatible with the Arcade model.

oa9w8N6jaa	your question is very unclear. if your referring to the drum machine and its output to the power supply that powers the speakers most are 1  speakers themselves depend on the speakers and the wiring. a good formula for figuring the ohm of a speaker cabinet is to divide the number  of speakers  by the ohms of each speaker. For example if you have 4 16 ohm speakers in a cabinet you take 16 and divide by 4, which equals 4. <br>  2 8 ohm speakers would be 4, that only works if they are on the same wired circuit without a converter, some speakers take the initial signal and channel it back into the speaker on a different circuit so you can have say  a tweeteer and a woofer at both 8 ohms on different circuits within the speakers and its still 8 ohms, on the same it would be of course 4.|`|475c01dc76b1f175b986a137414d9e50aa	Alvin - Do you mean a IDM02 Alesis Drum?<br>  <br>  If so, you cannot connect normal speakers to it - it needs an amp and speakers or amplified speakers.<br>  <br>  The drum module does not have an amp built in.

1yov0JF9aa	what do you consider "long range"? <br>  <br>  Your best bet is to use current technology and not build or modify current hardware. If you build or modify, you will need to have the device certified by the FCC if in the USA. FCC Cerification is not an easy process.<br>  <br>  Currently, there are a couple ways to do what you want. The first is GMRS (General Mobile Radio Service) and this is on 462MHz. GMRS requires a license from the FCC and permission from the GMRS repeater owner.<br>  Then there is IB (Itenerate Business). You apply for a license and you subscribe to a two-way shop's repeater system.<br>  MURS (Multi User Radio Service) is a license free service, you buy "dot band" transceivers at places such as Home Depot and higher end contractor suppliers. The "dot band" radios are paired up using color coded dots on the radio, license free and share channels with other users <br>  <br>  Then there is the cell phone.

p1dcw35Qaa	MR and ML are the front right and left. These are the large floor standing speakers you have. CEN is the center channel and it should be smaller than the main fronts and larger or the same size as the rears. You seem to know which one is the center anyway. The 2 smaller ones are the SR and SL (Surround right and left). They go to the sides of the listener. The jumper wires are for bi-wiring. Just leave them in place since you won't be bi-wiring them. You should also have a subwoofer which will look like a box unless the mains (2 big ones) have the subwoofer inside them.<br>  <br>  This link may be of help:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.smartbuyspeakers.com/speakersetup" rel="nofollow">http://www.smartbuyspeakers.com/speakers...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. I have to add that "I liked the color" is a terrible reason to buy speakers!!! :-) Sorry, I just couldn't answer without saying that.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, The RR and RL are for rear speakers in a 7.1 setup. You won't be using them so just leave them as they are. If you decide to buy 2 more speakers for the rear of the room, then you'll hook those to RR and RL and they should be the same speakers as the SL and SR.

Use the stand that came with the tv in the entertainment unit.
0UHArYDbaa	It depends how close you are to the TV transmitter. I live in hampshire and indoor aerials cannot pick up any signal, not even the ones with built in gain boosters, if you are near a transmission station such as Crystal Palace you would get a signal as good as with an outdoor aerial. Your best option would be to either invest in a video sender, or if your main aerial comes through the loft, you can buy splitter/boosters which would allow you to divide it off to other rooms.
aaMo4KIsaa	Your going to need an HDMI to DVI cable adapter. Audio must be handled separately though. Your TV has a native resolution that can't be changed if it's a pixel display.  If your TV is not HD, nothing can change that. If your TV is HD a HDMI to DVI will not tax the video signal. DVI and HDMI are exactly the same as one another, image-quality-wise. The principal differences are that HDMI carries audio as well as video, and uses a different type of connector, but both use the same encoding scheme, and that's why a DVI source can be connected to an HDMI monitor, or vice versa, with a DVI/HDMI cable, with no intervening converter box and will pass  but again, you have to run the audio separately.|`|Ns6I7MmBaa	Your TV is probably "HDTV Ready".  Its docs should say which video modes it supports.  If it is a CRT (tube) TV, it might only support 480/540 modes and 1080i.<br>  <br>  As mentioned you can connect HDMI to DVI using a suitable cable, but will need separate sound.  I have a DVI up converting DVD player connected to HDMI TV, but sound goes separately to a receiver with bigger speakers.<br>  <br>  The only issue you might run into is if it is a DVI "monitor" instead of HDTV Ready.  If it does not do HDCP copy protection, it might not be able to display DVD/BlueRay at resolutions higher than 480p (due to entertainment industry agreements).

e2o6hnLRaa	If you need a camera, go get one from a camera maker like Canon.<br>  Professionals use Canon or Nikon.<br>  Every phone that I used with camera feature sucks.<br>  They are very very very slow and blurry even thou it state 3.2mp.<br>  Mega pixel doesn't mean it's going to be good if it does not have the computing power behind it.<br>  ie. Kodak's 10mp is worst than a Canon's 5mp.<br>  <br>  The only phone that has a good camera is the iPhone or Nokia's top of the line phones.<br>  I saw my in-law's iPhone in action and the image is okay to show people and email or even print it.<br>  <br>  Any other phone's camera is just for fun.<br>  <br>  Spend $100 and get a Canon A1000 or similar model and you won't be sorry.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	You really cannot expect much from a cell phone. Cameras with any kind of resolution depend upon a fine lens and decent size sensor, usually unrelated the pixel count (the old Nikon Coolpix 990 had only a 3.1 mp sensor, but its sensor was huge when compared to the sensors found in todays 8 mp P&S cameras so could perform under some professional studio conditions).  The sensors on cell phones are even smaller than those in P&S cameras, so expecting high resolution, sharp images is perhaps having too high an expectation from a phones camera .. after all it is primarily a phone and a device for accessing other wireless features like texting, email access and the like.|`|nU5UqACUaa	Make some pictures and find out by your own. In such things, opinions differ and opinions are like butts, everybody has one.<br>  There is no measure to evaluate a camera or any "thing" that makes pictures, only the picture it makes can tell you.|`|vkzkXWfzaa	All phone cameras are not worth anything, the 3Mp is 'interpolated' from a tiny sensor. A camera with an OPTICAL 3Mp sensor would print great qaulity pictures up to 7" X 5" and pretty good ones a lot bigger than that. <br>  <br>  Interpolation means that the camera 'invents' pixels to pad out the file size. It will print bigger, but there is little actual data in the file so quality is dire.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|ARTqP2w6aa	I have an Ericsson K800i phone and it has a 3.2 mega pixel camera too.

They were saying they could hear what was going on around the number that they had tapped into.  If they can do that then I think it is very possible with satellites to watch you through your television.|`|A9MDoFooaa	yeah and through your computer screen - the usa's nsa have been using these for years.|`|21oTfY0Kaa	Yes!!!We Are always Watching!!!|`|kGld130yaa	Don't worry, thats a no.|`|HXILtO0Gaa	interesting, id like to say no, but they probably can.|`|vibMky05aa	No, because I think that a TV is kind of like a projector right?|`|a9X4EUdlaa	simple answer is no the reason is your tv set is just a receiver you could put a box on it like they do for tv program rateings, now that is a transmitter so it can send a singnal with the right data if you had a camera on it as well the you could be seen.|`|9aa992c6c58704c0274f9d3f157eaafcaa	can i just add and interesting point to this.

CQA4HAdmaa	I'm not a fan of the Nano-So I say no.  In the end you want it to play music, video, store pics and hold your computer data.  For $30 more you can get a "Classic" that stores 120 GB with a larger screen and its memory can be upgraded.  The Nano does not allow you to ever upgrade the memory.  You can also save money and get the same warranty by getting a refurbished iPod.  They are just as good and cost less.<br>  <br>  If you do want a Nano you can get one for $170.  You can get the 80GB Classic for same price.  The touch is also discounted 30% refurbished<br>   <br>  That way you can work less.  BTW;  If I were you I was get something that enables you to keep your ipod on your clothing. If you look on this site, you will see a lot of people with stolen or lost ipods.  You can also have your ipod engraved. I would hate to see you work so hard, buy something like that-only to see that you lost it.|`|Kpuuuwc5aa	I have a the same model, different colour tho.

9mTctb7jaa	Computer VGA is not the same as NTSC television. The VGA to S adaptor cables only work if your Graphics card in the computer is designed to output television compatible video at the VGA port. This is a very uncommon feature. The closest compatible VGA to television is to set the display to 480x640 with interlace and 60 Hz refresh. If the graphics card does not output NTSC, then the best you can do is display B/W, basically you will just see the compter green channel, but in B/W. To get real S-video, there has to ba a matrix to convert RGB to Luma and Chroma. Further the Chroma has to be modulated on a 3.58 MHz color carrier. These are things that a simple cable does not do. Even if the VGA connector has audio on it, S-video does not. Audio will have to come from the computer sound card, usually a miniplug output.|`|sPWzvWehaa	Your TV doesn't have RCA plugs for sound anywhere?|`|GWoW1o5oaa	no sound, only video.

Take your chip to your local photo place and print them up if you like, and have them put the pictures onto a CD.<br>  <br>  Then throw your camera away. It's not even worth fixing, you'd be better off buying a new one, especially if you have a Kodak or a Sony. Go with a better camera company like Nikon or Canon. Canon makes amazing point-and-shoot cameras, and when it comes to SLRs, I personally prefer Nikon. Both companies are professional-grade, so you know you're getting your money's worth.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	if you have $150<br>  sure, get it fixed<br>  or think about buying new|`|aBazvBnAaa	OHH that sucks >.<<br>  I droped mine 2 months ago and it stuffed up the wires inside<br>  <br>  .. you can get it fixed..

Pros use them if you notice.<br>  Entry level DSLRs are: Nikon D40, D60, Canon XS (1000D), XSi (450D)<br>  The cheapest and oldest is the D40 with no image stabilization.<br>  I had the Canon Rebel XSi and it was fantastic.<br>  Entry level DSLR are light and small.<br>  Nikons' grip feel more secure than Canons.<br>  <br>  I sold my XSi and got the Nikon D90 for $1125.<br>  It's has HD movie recording and the lens have 5x zoom.<br>  Right now, price wise, entry DSLR range from $450 to $650.<br>  Nikon's D80 is around $800.  The lens is 7x zoom compare to entry level DSLRs at 3x.<br>  After that's it's all in the $1000 and up.<br>  <br>  I recommend to:<br>  get the Nikon D40 if you are very tight on money and don't care about all the new fancy features.  It's the basic of them all.<br>  Get the Canon XS or D60 if you want image stabilization.<br>  Get the Canon XSi if you want an all around entry level DSLR.<br>  Get the Nikon D80 for the zoom and image quality.<br>  Get the Nikon D90 if you want everything including movie.<br>  Get the Canon 40D if you want weatherproof and faster shoots.<br>  After the 40D, they are more semi-pro and professional camera that cost over $1300.<br>  You can't go wrong with any Canon or Nikon.

You need wide aperture lenses which let more light into the camera, all DSLR perform about the same in low light. Telephoto wide aperture lenses will cost several times the cost of the camera body, but its the only true solution, particualrly if you want to capture action in low light.<br>  <br>  Some of the top end cameras such as the Nikon D3 have very low noise so you can crank up the ISO (which makes the camera more sensitive to light) without increasing noise too much, but that is an expensive exception and is still not as good a solution as solving the problem with a fast lens.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	nikon D40<br>  go to kenrockwell.com<br>   to read about it

VJ1C5JsYaa	First off Craig K is a spammer so please ignore him. <br>  <br>  Secondly it is advised to not bother with an intercooler. The nykos intercooler does indeed damage the system. MS advises you not to use it also. Just because that's where the power is does not mean that's where you have to keep it. The power cord is about 6 feet long. When playing pull the console out as far as you can so that it is more in the open. This is your best bet it helping it stay cool.|`|3cs1ukkGaa	Inter coolers are very handy, I've got one for my xbox 360 (premium).

The Arcade is a good choise for people who don't plan on playing or saying tons of games and extra content.

jN5SXl5Caa	If your going to play online killzone 2 is awsome. If you aren't then there are better games out there. I just got killzone today and was late for work because I couldn't put it down. It's got a great leveling system and intense battles that keep you on your toes. I would say it's right up there with GTA4 if MGS was to slow moving Killzone is a million times faster. I would give killzone a 9.5/10|`|8EmeNHyjaa	That is a good fun game.The graphic are stunning.|`|pl2SocVKaa	well you may be interested in saints row 2 its simila to gta 4 in a way so you may enjy that and killzone 2 its either love it or hate it just try the demo first and see what you think|`|1HtTxOOQaa	Killzone 2 is the most addictive game I have played. The graphics are stunning, online can rival COD4 and it's the best FPS till date at least on a console. I think you are emphasizing  on re-playability and that is where KZ2 doesn't disappoint. The online is addictive, but even the single player mode can be replayed many times cause the game posts the best AI. SO every time you start a certain level, the enemy AI uses new strategies to kill you and so you will always have a new encounter. The AI makes the game worth playing many times and there are so many epic battle sequences that I can't even recollect all of them. <br>  <br>  KZ2 is a solid shooter and is a must buy if you own a PS3.|`|YI8V5e36aa	Killzone 2 is amazing!

xTioPxaVaa	I've never been a fan of soft guitar cases (or "gig bags" as they are sometimes referred as).  But then again, the crews that have worked with me are one step this side of the gorillas in the old Samsonite luggage commercials (search on YouTube to see what I mean).<br>  <br>  There's no real difference in the designs...they're all pretty much the same.  What you want is a good amount of padding, well sewn seams, and a zipper that's not going to jam up the second time you use it.<br>  <br>  It I was going to buy one, I'd probably look at Gator brand.  I've got a pedal board bag from them that's put together very well.<br>  <br>  Another company that's kind of got a buzz going is Road Runner cases.  They have what they call their Polyfoam acoustic guitar case that claims to have the protection of a hardshell case with the weight of a gig bag.  If that's true, I'd consider it for going to open mics locally!  At $60, the price is right.<br>  <br>  Guitar Center should carry both of these.<br>  <br>  The important thing is making sure that the guitar fits correctly, so you'll need to take it to the store to try it out.  <br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken

Yl9wYjtGaa	honestly your not going to see a huge difference in either tv. plasma handles motion A LOT better then the LCD so any quick moving games would technically be better on it but theres some dangers to Plasma. manufactures have done many things to prevent picture burn-in's but it still happens all the time. basically a still image or a very frequently accruing image will actually burn into the screen. so if you hit pause or start and fall asleep or leave? theres a chance when u get back your plasma tv will have burnt that image into your screen. making it a really big picture frame of the start menu it you catch my drift. ive never personally seen anything that bad mostly i hear of like CBS logos burn in to the corner of tvs or like NFL score boards but yea its just a risk with going with plasma. also plasma uses a thicker glass up front (good for getting pissed and throwing your controller) but bad for glare. <br>  <br>  on the other hand tho you can get a plasma a lot cheaper then lcd so if its being used JUST for gaming might not be a bad choice.<br>  id say if its just for your gaming get a plasma. (if you dont have alot of glare issues with your room) make sure its 1080p and look at larger sizes like i said there cheaper, you might be able to get a 42" for the price of a 32" lcd.<br>  if your geting a tv and using your game on it id go LCD cuz its just a longer lasting sharper image TV. 32" for 5-7 hundred (color contrast  8,000 - 1 or above for top quality)|`|fdelyVYJaa	10bit screen and 120Hz update rate is the best for the games.<br>  Try to read: Should I Buy a LCD TV or a Plasma TV? from<br>  <a href="http://yefimsanswers.blogspot.com/2009/03/should-i-buy-lcd-tv-or-plasma-tv.html" rel="nofollow">http://yefimsanswers.blogspot.com/2009/0...</a>

The higher the number, the better the quality of your images (because it can display more different colors, black would resemble actual black, and white would be very white). It is just a characteristic of your tv, not a setting. So the answer would be no..|`|becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	You can certainly change it, but only by making it lower! 2,000:1 is the best possible. By lowering Brightness and Contrast you can certainly make it lower.|`|K01NU24saa	Answer 1 is total right ! no way for setting, is the Quality, the LCD Display panel Quality. mose of the local in-house brand always use low quality LCD display panel, because of prices , you paid more to those Worldwide international brand,( Sony.Sharp.Samsung.Panasonic.) there always use hi-end great quality LCD display panel for great pictures quality.
H40987QIaa	Nah, I looked at all sorts of options like that, I even considered building it myself and I thought that was a bad idea because I could easily break something.  I got my newest custom PC from a smal business called nanafriend.  They have excellent prices, and great service, I never feel in the dark with my PC.  Obviously I recommend them as my experience with them was so great.  www.myspace.com/nanafriendpcs .  That is where I contacted them originally.  I hope this helps

EJlUJyB8aa	You need to quit being a homo and using yahoo answers.<br>  <br>  - for a conference room 720p will be fine.  Question is, most stuff these days is 1080i.  So really it doesn't matter.  <br>  <br>  And you don't need a tv, you need a projector.  <br>  <br>  I would look into the dell ones since that I what I use at work for the exact setup as you.  They have auto shutdown, more connections than you would need for hooking up to a  laptop.  Furthermore, they look pretty good.  <br>  <br>  The autoshutdown feature is nice because those bulbs get really hot and wear out pretty fast.  Also, understand that you will be replacing a projector bulb faster that you thought.  Our 2 at work are used pretty much daily and we have to replace the bulbs about every 1.5yrs.<br>  <br>  You will also need to get a screen or build one that is 12x14.|`|p1dcw35Qaa	The 3ft is very close and will probably be a bit uncomfortable. I'd go with a 42" which is a bit small for the 9' person but figuring the average person will be 6' away, it should work well. As for resolution, 720p should be fine.
Rgqhr3zRaa	what is it going to be about
i7DKiaHBaa	i dont think its related to how many calls they get, i think its the decision of the person in charge in the control room.<br>  <br>  for example, a plane crashes in the middle of moorland, and there's only one farmer who see's it all happen, so there's only one phone call to emergency services, it'd still be a major incident.

RpCwfcRzaa	Sounds like the mic may have created a surge which shorted your 360 out. SInce you've had it for over a year, you can't get it fixed fro free by Microsoft. If you mom bought an extended warranty from whatever store she got it from, now would be a good time to check it and see if it's still under warranty. if not, you will need to call MS at 1-800-4-My-Xbox and tell them what happened. They'll charge you $100 to fix it though.|`|wIM3vNtwaa	Check the 360's powerbrick light. Is it orange (if it is it's not the power brick), if it's red, the powerbrick fried.<br>  <br>  Either ring Microsoft and tell them. They'll know what to do|`|VJ1C5JsYaa	Just as something to try you should unplug all the cables from the xbox. If it unplugs from something then unplug it lol. Wait a little bit and plug them back into the xbox and wall and see what you get. If it was the RRoD you would be able to turn it on and see the lights. This simply sounds like the Xbox is not getting power.|`|xUDbzhWfaa	1. You can always call Microsoft. 1800-4MY-XBOX.  If they can fix it, they'll send you a box to ship it to them in, and they'll fix it for you.<br>  <br>  2.  It doesn't sound like the red ring of death.  It must be another form of hardware failure.
CyHObN4Waa	i have the LG Flare. never had the Sprint M320 but the Flare is sweet. the voice quality is the only not great thing. but the ring tones sound perfect. its just when you make a call. the speed of the buttons and really good. my mom has a better looking phone than me but mine is better. so i would definately say the LG Flare.|`|K9kS63mDaa	lg flare
qWicVoU9aa	If you or someone else tries to activate the device and the IMEI comes up on the blacklist as stolen then the person that has the device goes to jail for being in possession of stolen merchandise and you go to jail for insurance fraud (which by the way could be a felony)|`|F0uLexezaa	you'll need to make a police report. falsifying a report is a crime.<br>  <br>  next unless you have insurance it will not be replaced for free. you'll have to buy a new one. until you buy a new phone, you will still be charged your monthly rate|`|8b5503e7febc933ef92cfaa3b4f51379aa	Well, it depends on if you have insurance on your current phone/plan, and how much the phone you wants costs. If you claim your phone is stolen, you will have to file a claim, fill out paperwork, and then they will proceed with providing you another phone. <br>  <br>  If the phone you want costs more than your coverage will allow, you will have to pay a deductible (the balance) of the cost of the phone. If not, you may get it for free (which probably won't happen). <br>  <br>  You may want to look into how much an upgrade will cost, it may  be cheaper.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Yes you will need to file a police report, and they send you the same phone. It's not new, it's a refurbished phone. It's $50 they will put on your bill, so your getting an old phone for $50 and it's the same one. Also, if your old phone is activated again, it will be shown as stolen. It is also fraud. If/when found out you will be charged with insurance fraud, account cancelled, and criminal charges laid. Fraud is a felony.

njxxqc3Raa	Hello:<br>  <br>  First, you have to install the Sony Ericsson PC Suite.  That sets up the drivers the system needs to show the Phone to SE Media Manager.  <br>  Second, if you don't have a memory card in the phone, SE Media Manager won't see the phone -- the phone itself only has about 14M of memory, so SE set it up so Media Manager won't access it unless you install more.  There's a MicroSD slot in the battery compartment.<br>  Last, the Phone has to be in USB/File Transfer mode to work with Media Manager.

The wii comes with 1 controller already, so you need to buy an extra controller.  Mario Kart comes with one wheel so you'll need to buy a second wheel.  Get a Rechargeable docking station for your controls, its really worth it.  You can get one wii fit set and that will be fine, my husband and I take turns.  Don't get the Rechargeable battery set for the wii fit, with the way its set up it will end up breaking like mine did.  I got my wii about 3 weeks ago and it is so worth it all.|`|9yqBlx35aa	no, as long as you get the two wii boards, 2 nunchucks, two controllers, and two steering wheels youll be fine.  you could look into a wireless sensor bar for less clutter.

Cbudy6dGaa	hmm..Im guessing you either bought a refurbished system or used. ( I bought used to its alright haha) But, Im pretty sure you have to take off the faceplate on the xbox and see if the MICROSOFT warranty seals are still on there. Or any type of warranty,contact wherever you got it from and talk to them about it. I just had the same problem and just sent my xbox back out to the company I bought it from literally 20 minutes ago. Just take off your faceplate and see if the warranty is there. If not your going to have to bring your xbox to your local game shop and pay to get it fixed. hope this helped. Sorry about your red ring!!|`|iGy9j1uaaa	I had the same problem when my xbox died as did a friend of mine. I think it's something to do with the console not registering itself properly when you first use it. You will have to phone the MS support directly. You will need the serial number and i think the manufacturing date of your console.
jN5SXl5Caa	Well unfortunately she is in the right. If she takes this PS3 and they say whats wrong with it and she says it freezes. So her manager says show me. ANd she can't then she is in trouble from her boss. If you have a warranty then just turn it on at home for like 10 hours and cover the vent and that should over heat it, but check your warranty first to make sure it is covered. My buddy did it with 360. His game tray wouldn't work so he left it on till he got the red ring of death. <br>  Also I get that but only when I play Fallout 3. Fallout 3 always freezes my system. But other games usually don't|`|Z5A33IR3aa	cause the warraty doesnt cover that kind of damage|`|cddb16aa82a34a10ef1d3b4255960a9faa	Don't play it all day, they do get hot, you probally messed it up.|`|DGOANtyfaa	ok buy a new one change the old one that's it ok|`|xFdz9CMKaa	I've had to replace 2 PS3's because the disc loader broke on both of them.  But I bought my extended warranty through Best Buy and I've never had a problem.  Always gotta be careful about where you buy stuff and how their warranty program works.<br>  <br>  If they can't tell that it's broken they won't give you a new one, it's pretty simple.  I think your's would just have to lock up completely for them to do anything, otherwise they'll just think you're complaining about a few random freezes, which they all do sometimes...

It is Truly a classic amongst digital (if that is possible) bodies and definately worth a looksee.
qp9I8NT9aa	I really don't see why you would prefer 2.0 to 2.2.<br>  <br>  2.0 would have more bugs and generally be slower than the current firmware, there would be no Genius playlist feature and you wouldn't be able to use 90% of apps on the appstore because they're all optimized for 2.2 now.<br>  <br>  If you really want 2.0 you'd have to torrent it or you may be able to find it on your PC. On windows you have to go your home folder (C:/Users/*USERNAME*/<br>  <br>  Then go to folder preferences and find the option to reveal hidden folders. You'll see a folder called 'AppData'.

rdtXVBv5aa	Yes, you most certainly can. Just stick it in disc slot like you would with a Wii game.<br>  <br>  However, you might need a few things...<br>  <br>  - A Gamecube controller. The wireless Wavebird is usually a favorite amongst many, but they are getting harder to find and thus the used ones that are available are getting expensive. I own this offbrand one and it works great (Even has rumble support which the Wavebird doesn't): <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016020XS?ie=UTF8&tag=wc01f-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0016020XS" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001602...</a><br>  (Of course... the wired controllers are just fine if you don't mind wires)<br>  <br>  - A Gamecube memory card. There is no way around this and you are obviously going to want to save your games.<br>  <br>  You will see a little flap/door at the top of your console. Just flip that up and stick your Gamecube components there.<br>  <br>  Also, please note that once you select a Gamecube game from the disk channel, you will not be able to access the Wii menu through the Wii Remote. You will need to walk up to the system and manually reset it. Kind of a pain but there are lots of great Gamecube games. <br>  <br>  While you are it, definitely check out Zelda: Wind Waker and Eternal Darkness as those are my two personal Gamecube favorites.|`|EHODvf1raa	Yes, plug in the Game Cube controllers on the top of your Wii, underneath a little flap.

cLW7vFUGaa	Hi! It really is a great game, isn't it?<br>  <br>  Well, there are a lot of different foods you can find, buy, or prepare to refill your bar throughout the day. A good, simple thing to collect is Mushrooms, which can be found laying around in the Ganache Mine without wasting any energy whacking rocks to get them. Because of the way items stack in your rucksack, you can easily keep yourself stocked with up to 99 small meals for emergency energy boosts.<br>  <br>  Also, a good way to make energy-stressless money early on is fishing at the Caramel Falls near the top of Caramel River District. In that area, there is a secret Hot Springs that you can access by climbing up a semi-hidden rock path. Soaking in it takes an hour out of your day, but completely refills your energy bar, no matter how low it was before!<br>  <br>  But for permanent stamina-bar enhancement, you need Power Berries! There are five berries hidden throughout the game that will actually expand the length of your stamina bar. Instead of food that gives you an immediate one-time boost, these permanently allow you to hold more energy during each day.<br>  <br>  You'll get each one through a special cutscene when you...<br>  <br>  1) Reach Skill Level 3 for your fishing rod. (Increase tool skill by using them often; progress with skill level can be monitored in one of the pages in your menu accessed by holding down the C button.)<br>  <br>  2) Till 1000 squares with your hoe. (You can only hoe on the soil of land you own, like the one in front of your original house and on whatever properties you buy from the Town Hall.)<br>  <br>  3) Get an animal to 10 hearts.<br>  <br>  4) Reach the bottom (30th floor) of the Ganache Mine, and there should be a "sparkle" on the ground to the far upper right that you can approach and pick up.<br>  <br>  5) Open up the Harvest Goddess Spring in Mt. Gelato. (You have to have completed Ben's Rainbow, and acquired Ben's badge from East Gull Island - accessed by Daren's/Collin's rainbows - in order to be able to cross Ben's rainbow, which will lead to the Mt. Gelato area. You can climb up the mountain, but you'll reach a bear cave where the mother won't let you pass. Feed her 14 Decent Honey - two a day for 7 days - and she'll clear the path to the Goddess Spring where the stump of the old Mother Tree - along with a Power Berry - can be found.<br>  <br>  Some, like that last one, are obviously not available until much later in the game, and it wouldn't be a good idea to try to get them now all at once... But Harvest Moon life is so much more fun and less stressful once you have the ability to do more throughout the day. Good luck!<br>  <br>  ...Oh, and by the way - I haven't passed out yet and had to visit the doctor, so I'm not sure if there's a different person who talks to you, but... If you're talking about Jin, he's a "he." xD
ktbyKKK9aa	There are two 80GB models. There's the 80GB with Backwards Compatability(Lets you play PS1, PS2 games) and there's the one without it. If you have the one without Backwards Compatability, then its impossible to make it play PS1 or PS2 games unless they are downloads. If that's your model, then the PS/PS2 Memory Card can only be used to store PS1/PS2 data.|`|cddb16aa82a34a10ef1d3b4255960a9faa	they do, or so i've heard I just have a 60Gig, but my little brother has an 80 and he said it does also, and some other say they dont. it may have to be updated with the latest Verison of software|`|DGOANtyfaa	the ones that got 4 port on the ps3 can play ps2
vek9jD9daa	skull candy<br>  <a href="http://www.skullcandy.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.skullcandy.com/</a>|`|UZneyE7Haa	skullcandy have REALLY GOOD BASE~ try those thats what i have i use them for my screamo music and my metals! try them out|`|u3bxLdAXaa	Skull Candy have greatsound quality however they arn't very durable. Mine broke in under a week. :(  <br>  <br>  Apple/ipod head phones are decient the sound quality is good as well as the durability. <br>  <br>  As well I heard that Sony headphones are good too. <br>  <br>  when you go buy a pair ask a sales rep. for their opinion. just to be safe.|`|BmtJd3foaa	I would prefer apple's headphones because they r really good and i think they are great to listen to music with. Apple is goin to give a remote and a mic. It cost about $79 and free shipping if u order online. I will give a link<br>  below|`|DOp5vkHQaa	ink'd and skullcandy!

e598449d055c2ea33bc5dbaf4738f950aa	here use sim card;-)|`|q3lzWKkXaa	No mobile phone can do anything that requires connection to the operator's network without a compatible SIM card. Nokia N97 works with any compatible GSM/WCDMA SIM card.|`|n0S7GJDXaa	if your country doesn't support sim then odds are the suppliers that sell the phone will not allow a sim. BUT if you get the phone from a sim card area (europe) then you can unlock it and use like those pay as you go cards to top up instead of a sim card
