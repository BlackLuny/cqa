So if we are attacked again, this time by Egyptians in an attack masterminded out of Pakistan, and Obama retaliates by invading Iran because it is run by a "bad guy" who is supposedly developing WMD's, will Republicans hail this as a fantastic decision or a dangerous and naive blunder?

20090223164417AAqWTP6	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	PA  - Child support arrears dropped for disability?	My husband has been disabled for over the last year.  Before that, he was trying to work, but had accrued arrears on his child support.  He is awaiting an appeal hearing for SS.  We filed a modification to really just stop his current payments until he was able to work again or until he got his social security.  The moderator agreed and suspended the order, but she also dropped the arrears, which we weren't expecting.  His ex-wife filed an appeal, stating that he wasn't really disabled and we went through the hearing, they had his doctor come in to testify, etc.  Anyway, the judge said my husband more than proved his burden that he wasn't able to pay current support and kept the order suspended; however, he had to make a delayed judgment on the arrears.  This is what the final order says:   After hearing, this Court took under advisement the issue of remitting arrears in the case where the Defendant is found to fully disabled presently.  We are satisfied that the conference officer properly considered Pa.R.C.P. 1910.19(f).  We have been informed of DRS memorandum 2008-22, which discusses the remittance of arrears when applying Pa.R.C.P. 1910.19(f) to a support case.  The memorandum addresses the entry of the PACSES system using the following language "arrears as of xx dollars remitted without prejudice to be reinstated in the event of a change in circumstance or ability to pay as appropriate."  For the reasons generally discussed then at the hearing we confirm the remittance of arrears without prejudice.  We do note Defendant's continuing obligation to confirm through his doctor his disability at least quarterly.        My question is - can anyone translate that?  Is that saying that if he would get social security, and probably a lump sum payment at first, does he have to pay his arrears?  Would we have to re-file a modification to report he has money?  Or is this saying that it's all been dropped?        Thanks!

20070223155724AANxUSq	Politics & Government;Government	How do YOU like my plan to reform Government as we know it?	WARNING:   If you like big government & it's taxes, move on you'll hate this.      We all live under 5 layers of government, Fed, State, County, Twp & city, all requiring big $$ from us to fund this dinosaur of dysfuntion. 74.9% of all taxes (all levels) is nothing but salaries and pensions for buracrats, FACT!      First, we divide the county in 10 sectors (no more states), we rid ourselfs of 40 state houses, saving 297 billion yearly.      Each sector has a governnor, 2 fed senators & congressmen as per population. Each sector has 30 counties each for local control.      All taxes will be paid via the VAT, value added Tax, a national sales tax, at 18% NO more income tax that cost tax payers 122 billion just to run it, we fire 92% of IRS empolyees.      We rid ourself of wasteful Twp & city government, and savings of 760 billion.      Fed, remains the same, President, House Senate...just a whole lot fewer of them.      Pleae ask me any question and I'll answer you right away      how do you like it?
20070312102215AAdHLyX	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Why Patrol 25 yards of Highway?	In our little town we have on our most northern tip, we have 25 yards of express-way, we don't even have an exit, it's 4 miles down in a neighboring community.   Yet on any given day you can find 2 of the 3 on duty officers with their radar guns patroling our little patch of highway. The officers must travel through another town and then travel back to get to the 25 yards they protect dailey. Our local newpaper just ran an article asking why..we all want to know why. We had a robbery here last Month and it took them 15 minutes to respond because they had all that back tracking to do. We all know why they do this, to catch a soccer mom doing 69mph in a 55 and get some $$...now City officials & Police are pointing fingers at each other on who's fault this latest blunder is!      Shouldn't we allow Police to DO Police work and   not focus on 25 yards on highway that NObody cares about?

Our school district as so many others were ran by social liberals, we learned oh so well their social experiments. I lived on the out-skirts of a large city...this was a time when the liberals wanted bus children around to achieve a FORCED intergration between races. My former school not more than 5 minute walk from our home. Then the curse of liberalism, they forced myself, brother and sister into an inner-city school that was beyond belief. After 3 Month's my 8 year old sister was beaten and robbed by 3 black girls. My outraged parents refused to send us there any more...we moved to Greensburg. I will never forget what liberal democrats did to our family, the scares are with my family to this very day. I could list on and on what my family went through...but I think you get my point.      What's your story?

The subject is different, the era is another yet it's the same idea...the value of a human life. In the 1850 it was just a ******...today it's just a mass of tissue. The Pro-choice movement today has the exact same idea's that their ancestors the slave owners did..they both don't value or respect human life. The slave owners argued we could set the slave free because no one could take care inferior blacks just as the pro-abortion movement say no one will take care of these children. If you notice they both lie, we have waiting list years long waiting for children..YEARS long & WAITING! I would encourage you to read the history of the fight for freedom for black Americans...you will be blown away by the exact arguments used then by the Slave Owners are the EXACT same arguments.   agree?

This is a fact. They have enough nuke pants and breeder reactors to make anything they want in the way of weapons.  They've done it before.  They also regularly launch stuff into space. Best guess is if they don't have nukes rightnow, they could have them in less than a year if need be. Question is would they do it or have they already assembled an arsenal, not being so sure we would protect them unless they got hit first. There is also the question of us being tired of providing them with 'military welfare' for all these years. That costs us a bunch. Their standard of living is one of the best in the world because we pay to defend them. I think it's time they pick up the tab.

In every town USA, I would say, you hold fair vote for rules and regulations over violence, vice and viriles, in other words, police and gangs allowed and united to enforce the local customs, a red light district in every town USA where any sexual vice and drug vices allowed are managed by the ruling  peoples choice of sanctioned police and gangs.

It is something that happened two years ago, that I thougt was resolved. Well because me not knowing a civil and criminal case was totally different, I thought my nightmare was over when the civil case had been dismissed.        I have found in this mess, that the law seems to only apply to those of significant wealth and not of people who REALLY are innocent.  I have since hired an attorney, which I will go into station and face whatever it is...      At the same time, I a mother of kids and I work a job who is being bought by another company.  That company will be doing a background search.  I was told that arrest may show up but they can not disclose it.  That they can only disclose convictions.  I was thinking of taking a leave of absence to avoid it until it is cleared up.  YOu see if I loose my job, I loose the only way I take of my kids.      I would appreciate any real assistance from anyone on this matter.

IF the McCain/Palin ticket should win the election next month, (either by chance or they steal it) then will Track Palin be allowed to serve in Iraq with a secret service man with him at all times for protection?       OR  will he be forced to stay back in USA and do boring duties on the army base - again with a secret service man protecting him?      VP and POTUS familes are entitled to secret service protection during and after their term of office.      I would like to know the official Military regulations - NOT just your speculation.       It is fine that Track is doing his duty - but he is entitled to a secret service protection IF his mom gets the VP job.       So under army regulations, will he get that protection or not? Or will he be forced to resign and go back to Alaska - oops Washington DC.

Other countries that have much higher testing score averages then the U.S. use a system in which the government money is attached to the kid and the kid and the parents have the choice in which school they will attend. So this forces schools to try harder so that they can get kids to come and fund their schools with the money that is attached to them.   This would also allow schools that are bad to be shut down. Than the kids would just go to a different school.   This system sounds great.

I think we were once again fooled by our government into thinking the bail out money would end the crisis. It hasn't. Even with other countries pouring money into the global market, the crisis still exists and the market goes down.       We, as tax payers will be paying for it, as will our children and grandchildren. I think Bush has screwed us again. How many times did he appear on TV with his lame speeches as to why Congress has to pass this bail out plan? 20, or 21 times, or something like that?       Will Americans ever learn that Republican leaders are the biggest crooks that exist in this country? Yes, the Democrats voted for it too, but they had no choice. If they didn't they would have only been attacked and blamed for the problem. We MUST get rid of Republican leaders. Notice I didn't say Republicans. I said Republican leaders. At least any associated with the Bush nightmare years. Our country is going downhill fast.

Como todos los a?os la empresa me ha regalado una agenda. Cada día trae una cita. La de hoy es de Russell A. Jones y dice: "la última función de una profecía no es predecir el futuro, sino construirlo".      Esa cita me ha llebado a recordar mis estudios de economía, en concreto el fenomeno de las profecías que se autocumplen. Una profecía que se autocumple es una suposición o predicción que por la sola razón de haberse hecho, convierte en realidad el suceso supuesto, esperado o profetizado y de esta manera confirma su propia "exactitud".       Las profecías que se autocumplen se dan en muchos ámbitos de la vida. Algunos ejemplos:       # Psicología: Si alguien por alguna razón supone que se lo desprecia, se comportará precisamente por eso de un modo desconfiado, insoportable, hipersensible que inoculará a los demás el propio desdén del cual el sujeto estaba convencido y que queda así "probado".

Then 5 months after I work there (there was a 4 month evaluation period) I was fired. The reason being I was sick with an ear infection/fever and had a Dr's excuse for two days of work. I ONLY missed one day. Then, she called me into her office and let me go. Come to find out, I was fired on Thursday, and she moved a man from Corporate office into my position on Monday. It was a total set up. Can she fire me for being sick?? Also my unemplyment may not go through, I got a "Notice of Determination" in the mail, talking about Appeal Rights.

During that time, I suffered tremendous amounts of mental anguish and resentment. I went into the job with a positive attitude, but as time wore on..I began picking up on the way the coworkers operated.      I was never told anything about the dress code, other than "no jeans". So, I wore a pair of dark blue pants to work for FOUR months. Then, my boss decided to call me out in front of everyone. (I worked in a public setting!) She said "I know you don't have a lot of money." Etc, etc. Also, about six months after this..it happened again. (After I had bought new pants and wore them for 6 mths!)      In August of the next year, I was on my menstrual period and suffered from acne. (I'm unable to wear a lot of makeup, as I have sensitive skin.) So, one of my coworkers said.."Boy, are you broke out!!" I quit there last year. But now that I have my family situation settled, I'm ready to fight.      Can I legally sue these people?!

20081027105149AAiwO4r	Politics & Government;Politics	Why is it that immigrants (and/or their children) keep telling me to love the US or leave it?	There are very few things that I find redeeming about the US government. The Constitution, thats not so bad...it is a shame the way the country fails to live up to it though. Still, there are a number of people who keep telling me that I should leave the US if I don't love it.      I am descended from both Cherokee and Blackfoot Native Americans (French, Spanish and Africans as well). So that some of my ancestors have lived here since before the end of the last Ice Age, and those that weren't "became" Americans against their will as a result of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.      How is it that immigrants from Europe and Africa (or their descendants) feel justified in telling me to get out of my own country?      Why should THEY not leave and go back to whatever country they (or their grandparents) came from? Is it perhaps because those countries wouldn't want them back? Or is it just that there are more of them than there are of me (i.e. "Tyranny of the Majority")? If the latter, doesn't the Declaration of Independence establish the right to revolt against Tyranny?

20090223110107AAJlWd4	Politics & Government;Politics	When Obama laments, "I INHERITED this Deficit", does he forget how hard he APPLIED for the JOB?	There is only so much window dressing that a "clean-up specialist" can try to employ when they walk into a messy situation.  But the word I keep hearing from Obama is "inherit".....as in he and his group "inherited" these problems.      Well lets see...the verb "inherit" usually has to do with some sort of family or friendly relationship.  And since death is unpredictable, there is a measure of innocence on the part of those inheriting, not knowing when the benefactor was going to die.  So if they get something surprising from the estate, they can say, I "inherited it", and are somewhat not expected to be immediately responsible for whatever the inherited thing has done or is doing.      Well, the economy is like a living, moving, breathing entity...In some ways, it's like a baby with a life of it's own.  If someone died and left you in charge of their baby, would you talk down about it before the world...dis' it...and not claim it as your own, saying you "inherited it"...but should not be held responsible for it's behavior?      Whatever happened to the sign on the President's desk..."The Buck Stops Here"....???      Are you so caught up in throwing finger of blame at the past that you truly BELIEVE Obama had no idea what this economy -- this out-of-control problem child -- was going to be?  Do you really think he was that naive?      Tell you what...Let's let him BACK OUT, O.K.?  If he doesn't want the Presidency because the problems are too big, then he can just resign, and we'll choose someone else who doesn't think the economic misfit that is the American Economy is so ugly...so blameworthy...that Papa should walk away and not claim it as his own...WARTS AND ALL.      So my question is about Obama's use of the word "inherited"....Does that sound like a real father?  Or an opportunist who seizes the cat-bird seat only to blame predessors if his big new idea doesn't work?
