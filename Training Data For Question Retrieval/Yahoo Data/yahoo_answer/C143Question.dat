20090220082152AATsNly	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	It breaks my heart to look at my son?	And know the only male that SHOULD care about him, seems as though he'd be happier if I had a)never told him I was pregnant or b)the bleeding was a miscarriage or c)some other horrible thing to make Jamie not here any more...      I just don't know how to handle knowing that some day, I have to explain to Jamie why his father isn't around anywhere. (And no, I didn't bother informing him when I had Jamie, because he made it clear he didn't care.) It may be fair for his father to treat ME this way, but NOT our son...      How did you deal with the emotions and crap if you were in a similar situation?

I only have about 12lbs from when i found out that I was pregnant and now. I work out daily (sometimes twice a day) I walk/jog one mile a day when my husband gets home and do a routine video in the morning when I can. I also am watching what I eat. My menu is usually scrambled eggs with cheese on whole wheat toast for breakfast, a fiber granola bar with either yogurt, pudding or jello and a protein shake for lunch/snack and a salad with cottage cheese and protein shake for dinner. I stop eating by 7pm so as to not have anything "sitting" on me. I have been doing this about two weeks solid and the scale isnt budging. What else can I do. I know normally I would be losing with this regimine. I am also breastfeeding so I have to be sure to be getting enough nutrients and calories for the breast milk. I dont want to take any supplements that could harm my baby, thanks.

20090220102257AA9Z4Pf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Am i weird for wanting small boobs?	I'm 18 and 7 months pregnant. Before the pregnancy I was petite and I'm still small but the little budda belly is obvious lol. Of course my boobs are growing too but for some reason I don't want them to. I took me a while to adjust to the growing belly but I can't get over how big my boobs are growing. Before I was 36c. And even then I wore a size b cup. Now its to the point where it just looks horrible and squashed. Even my bra strap broke and I'm hoping its the bra made with poor quality and not me forcing my boobs to look small. Can anyone think of why I'm so uncomforatable with these changes. I'm confident and I love my body. Its just out of nowhere I have been feeling like this. Do they get bigger when the baby is born..and do they go back to the way they were or do they stay how they. And if they do get smaller, how long until then? Lol, and has any other women experienced these feelings too?
20090220102749AAO2wP5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I need more affection...?	I'm 22 weeks pregnant.  My husband (that I have been with for 4 years) has always been lacking in the affection department.  I am a very affectionate woman towards my husband (hugs & kisses for no reason, holding hands, back rubs, that kind of stuff).  I just wish I got some of the same stuff in return once in a while.  It has always bothered me and we have discussed it many times, but in the past month it has been REALLY bothering me.  To the point sometimes of crying when I am alone.  Now, I don't want to paint a bad picture of my hubby - he is an amazing man and a wonderful father to my 5yo step son.  He is thoughtful and caring, and I wouldn't trade him for the world.  I guess I would just like a little more attention in the lovey-dovey department.  I'd also like to mention that my desire to be intimate in the bedroom went to completely zero in the past few months.  (to which he has not complained and actually expresses concern about having sex while pregnant).        He knows that he is "not exactly the most affectionate man in the world" - his own words and says that it is something that he needs to work on, but he never actually tries to make progress.  I don't want to be a nagging and needy wife, but how do I get him to be more affectionate without him feeling bad or under obligation?

20090220103258AAtApDD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Placental Growth in Fetal Death (Missed Abortion)?	I'm concerned that I may have had a missed abortion (where the fetus dies but remains in the uterus).  I hope I'm just paranoid.        I had an ultrasound done at 6 weeks which showed a viable fetus with a beating heart.  However, I started bleeding / spotting that day, just prior to the ultrasound, and continue to spot regularly 2 weeks later.  The bleeding is often associated with pressure placed on the lower abdomen (e.g., strained BM's).  There are not other symptoms like cramping or passed tissue, so I wondering about the possibility of a missed abortion.        I still have some symptoms of pregnancy, such as slight soreness of the breasts & mild nausea, but the symptoms have decreased over the past 2 weeks.  I do notice that my mid section seems to be growing slightly, which seems to be appropriate for the gestational age.        Okay, here's my question.  If a missed abortion has occurred, does the placenta continue to grow or does it die along with the fetus?  I know that the placenta will grow in the case of a blighted ovum, mimicking pregnancy, but will I still be showing pregnancy symptoms and belly growth if I did have a missed abortion?

20090220105218AAtoVBX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How can I keep my 2 year old from hurting my 2 month old?!?	Ok... I have a daughter who is 22 months and will be 2 in April. I had a son 2 months ago on Dec.14th. My daughter is currently going though terrible two's and has decided her brother will be her target! I try to keep them as separate as possible but it is hard I have a crib that I place him in but she has recently learned how to flip herself into the crib. He has a swing but she now stops the swing and tries to sit on him. I realize she is only trying to play with him and does not fully understand what that he is too small for her to play with right now( despite my constant attempts to tell her this) but it is so hard to get anything done, because I am constantly on Gisele patrol making sure she is far away from him. Just yesterday he was sitting peacefully in his chair I turned my back on second to take the clothes out the dryer and she was trying to bend his arm back! Now I don't like spankings but she did get one because she is just not listening when it comes to the baby. This behavior goes on when they are there alone with my husband too and I am just afraid she will hurt him! I don't wanna keep spanking her though so is there anything I can do to save my son from her?    I have tried everything but she climbs into everything!       BTW: My daughter is REALLY smart so she understands what she is doing because as soon as she does something to him she runs or say OOOPPSSS sorry but then seconds later she is doing trying to do something new to him!

20090220105058AAkOtij	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I had a baby and now I'm not attracted to my husband anymore...?	Okay first of all I want to say how AWFUL I feel about this. I had a baby back in December and I know everyone says that you won't want to have sex for a while because of your hormones and body change and yadda yadda yadda...this I know. But I'm not attracted to my husband anymore...like not physically or emotionally anymore. he works usually from 4a-6p and when he's home he's either on the computer or playing a video game. we have had talks and even fights about how I wish he'd spend a LITTLE time with me and our 2 month old. He was good about it for about 4 or 5 days and then went back to what he was doing before. I just feel neglected and ignored. I've told him this and he REFUSES to see a marriage counselor with me. I have gone to my own counseling about this and my counselor said that it would help a lot more if he came to the sessions with me. I feel as though this is a never ending battle.      We havn't had sex since JUNE!! and he never showed any sort of physical attractivness or love towards me when I was pregnant. he didn't want to have sex with me because he was afraid of hurting the baby...even after being assured by our OB doctor it was not possible. A lot of my guy friends told me that I looked beautiful pregnant and my husband never said those things to me...not even once. I used to be super skinny with a FLAT stomach before having our daughter. I know that my body went through a lot and I dont' expect it to be flat for quite sometime, but I feel awful about myself. I dont even want to consider having sex until I'm back to my flat stomach and toned body. I gained 51 pounds during my pregnancy.      Anyhow...my question is this...have any of you moms felt like you were no longer attracted to your husband/boyfriend after having a baby? I feel so bad about it, but I just don't see the person I had married anymore. I don't see the loving, caring, and affectionate man anymore. *sighs
20090220105247AACpDe7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	17 weeks pregnant and scared of missed miscarriage?	I just posted this, but no one answered.. Sorry for posting again, but I just want to know if this is normal or something I should be worried about.      I can't stop worrying about my baby.. I heard the heart beat at 15 weeks... I had an ultrasound at 16 weeks weeks and my next appointment isn't until March 3rd. I haven't had any morning sickness at all, or any head aches, so I can say that I didn't REALLY feel pregnant before, either. But for a while, it was hurting when I had sex with my boyfriend and I thought that was due to being pregnant.. Well, we had sex the day before yesterday and it didn't hurt at all... And usually when I would go up the stairs I would be out of breathe and today I feel totally fine just running up and down the stairs. The only real symptoms I've had is sore breast, having to pee more often, darker nipples and really dry skin... All that stuff is still like that.      Am I worrying for nothing? It's so hard for me not to worry because I haven't felt any noticeable movement, yet. And I just feel completely fine.

So I have my information.  I have had any medical professional in my life advise me to stay on as well.      I'm just curious about real experiences people have had and how their babies are.

20090220104301AAoTuba	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How can I report this incident that happened at Babiesrus?	This morning, at babies r us, something happened that I wish the associates would of handled differently. My daughter got sick, and I asked the cashier to call the janitor or someone. So she called someone and they told her that I had to clean it up myself, with no help. Lets just say that I'm infuriated. I would expect something like this from walmart or another store, but not babies r us. This store caters to parents with children, therefore should be prepared for anything. Before someone says that I shouldn't take my daughter out if she was sick, I agree. But she wasn't sick. She was perfectly fine, until we got in line to pay. But back to the original question, Where can I call to report my dissatisfaction?

Long story short him and his partner went through the entire process with a birth mother but she backed out the day she went into labor. Since they paid all her expenses they were told she would have to pay them back. At the time he lived down south. We live in Colorado. So basically, we were wondering if she would be paid back the hospital bills, etc etc if the birth parents were to back out. Thanks!

20090220104005AA9p2jv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How to encourage 17 month old to talk?	My daughter is 17 months old and doesn't really talk yet.    She says a few words on and off again, like: no, mama, papa, ball, bear and book. But not consitantly she will say them one day and not on another day. She points a lot to things saying 'da da'. She does 'talk' to us a lot  and seems to be actually telling us all kinds of stuff (with changing sentence melody and gestures and all) but only in babytalk. When she wants something she will either point or incase of hunger or thirst take my hand and walk me to the kitchen where she points to the fridge or pantry, according to what she wants. She will also put her hand to her mouth in the motion like she was drinking from a  bottle, which means she is thirsty.   When we look at books she points at everything for me to say the words (for example: this is a duck, there is the ball.....) she does the same with the refridgerator and the closet (it'slike they are her new favorite 'books', she would spend hours there pointing at stuff and waiting for me to tell her what she is pointing at)   But she will not say any of the words herself most of the time.   The kids I know in her age actually don't talk much either, so I am not that worried, but when I look at the 2 year olds we know I get concerned because they really talk very good.      How did you help your kids to talk? What could I do to encourage her talking. I already talk to her a lot and read to her a lot, too. She does understand me talking, for when I tell her to do something simple, like 'lets go for a walk' she will go get her shoes and try to put them on.   Or when I say 'lets go wash hands' she goes to the bathroom and waits for me to lift her up to the sink, etc      Well I would appreciate any tips and experiences you had while your kids learned to talk.   We live in foreign country at the moment so my daughter will hear our native language at home and English in playgroup , when with her friends and whenever we are out. In these situations I will usually talk to her in English and repeat in our language. Don't know if that situation would have an effect on her starting to talk late as it is not truely bilingual as we do't speak English at home  and at her age she spends most time at home around me.
20090220104252AAxqYRu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Convertible Car Seat (Britax, Evenflo, Graco)?	I'm in the market for a new car seat, and have been going crazy doing research on the seats I think are suitable. The problem I have are the two cars we own. One is a Ford Focus and the other a VW Jetta (the newer model). I really like the Britax Regent and Britax Frontier, the Evenflo Symbphony and the Graco Nautilus come in close second, mostly because of the maximum height and weight limits they share with the Britax.   I wanted to know if anyone out there owns either of these four car seats, and has them installed in a small car like the ones we own. I want to know if the seats fit nicely and also if they interfere in any way with the passenger and/or driver seats.   My other child has a Recaro Como convertible seat, and it's REALLY BIG, we always have to place that one behind the passenger seat, because the person that rides on that side, will have to scoot the seat forward quite a bit. I personally don't mind, because it doesn't affect me at all I'm short, but it does bother my husband because he's an average 6'0.   Sorry for the long story, I just wanted to be as specific as possible with my concerns.   Thanks for the help!

I'm a first time mom, almost 5 months along.  And is working on my gift registry.  I can't decide if I should go for an infant seat then purchase a toddler seat later or just get the convertible one?  I realize that the convertible you can't take in and out of the car with you, like going to a restaurant or just having the ability to take out the baby without waking it up.  How did you do it?  Was it more or less convenient either way?  Convertible would save us some money but I am a social person and occasionally go out to lunch with the girls..

We are in the process of looking for a  new peditrician after having a really bad experience with her at my baby's birth.  So, we are also not getting useful information on our 9 day old boy's eating.  (Feels like we get the brush off and she is to busy!!!)      Anyways...   1.How can you tell if he is hungry or just wants to suck?   He loves his pacifier and to suck like all babies.    He will suck on the pacifier right after eating happily or will keep drinking.  We have been figuring so far he has had enough if he spits up?  He never "plays" with the nipple when getting full.      2.  I know each baby is different, but what is a guideline for how much he should be eating (since he will suck and suck!).   He is currently taking 2 oz every 3 hrs.  First our ped said that the should take 40-65 ml every three hrs in the hospital.  At his appointment she said that is a bit on the high side?  We have been trying to give him 2 1/2 oz today.  We just cant tell if he is satisfied because he tends to be the most awake after eating and wants to be held of he is fussing.

Family members are telling me it's not a good idea and I don't want to intentionally harm my baby. I also copy & pasted insert from report. I wanted to know other mom's opinions about this! Thanks.   **************************************...   Would exposure to ultrasound waves while developing in the womb disrupt normal brain development? To answer this question, researchers treated pregnant mice with ultrasound waves for 5,15, 30, 60, 210, or 420 minutes. A few days after the pregnant mice gave birth to their offspring, researchers analyzed the brains of the baby mice. While the brains of mice exposed to ultrasound waves for brief lengths of time (5 and 15 minutes) were normal, the brains of mice exposed to ultrasound waves for longer lengths of time (30, 60, 210, or 420 minutes) were not normal. Researchers found that when mice were exposed to ultrasound waves for long time periods, some brain cells failed to migrate to the correct location within the brain. Further, the longer the exposure to ultrasound waves, the fewer brain cells migrated to the correct location.

20090220112133AAMmj9Z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Thinking about having a C-Section?	I had a dream last night, that my son died during his birth. It was very vivid and kept repeating the whole night. I had been thinking about a c-section prior to this, but this dream sort of sealed it for me. I have a lot of pros for this. but only a few cons. Are there any other major cons to this?      Pros-   I get to schedule it, so my husband can make sure he is off work, and my parents can be there, and I am very into schedules.    My parents will be there to help me out for 2 weeks after he is born   I get to stay home until he is 2 months which is when most daycares in my area will start taking babies   It would ease my fear from the dream   I won't have to experience labor.      Cons   Major surgery   Scar (I already have one that is a foot long on my back)   hard to heal stomach muscles (I used to be a trainer and know how to train the muscles in that area)   If I have a second child I will need to have another C-Section (if I have a second I am getting my tubes tied after so its all one procedure)

Now, while I just say "no" or "we dont do that", I can tell he doesn't really 'get' it because he still will try. That is as far with discipline I go to with my infant of course. However, when he gets super grumpy and won't stop throwing a fit I say to him, "Do you want to go in you bed??" He HATES being in his bed and in his room alone. I have noticed every time I ask him that he quiets up real quick and will be fine for about a minute or two. Then he continues with his fit and I say it again. The same thing happens. Im wondering if he is making a connection?

We used to be so close but over the last year she's really separated from me and gone crazy for boys her age.  She'd also rather be around our mom instead of me, which is messed up because of all the problems our mom has caused.  I've taken care of my sis since she was a baby- was with her every weekend when our mom went out bar hopping.        Yes, I do have my own life, but family is family.  My little sis doesn't really have her dad around (he's in jail for molesting his other daughter) so I've been the only stable male figure in her life.  I say "stable" because our mom has brought several boyfriends into the house over the years.

He is not asking constantly nor is he whining about it.

20090220111755AAVfMcI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Am I being irrational against abortion?	I recently got pregnant. I was with this man for awhile, but I didn't really know everything about him until after I got pregnant. However, I am completely against abortion. I really don't want to do adoption either because I might set it up, but I'd never leave the hospital without my baby.      Here's what I'm working with:   The dad is...   *a drug dealer   *in and out of jail   *declared by a shrink to have 8 different personalities.   *is a convicted felon   *doesn't plan on finishing school   *is a dirty person   *lives with his family   *doesn't have a license   *doesn't have a car   *can not get a good job.   *does not have any job as of right now   *doesn't talk to me but once a week   *tries to tell me that we are together yet doesn't ever come around   *gets mad when i hang out with other guys (even though their just friends)   *will ignore me for weeks on end   *he's black (this OBVIOUSLY doesn't matter to me, but my extended family is very racist)      I don't want to subject my child to any of this. I also don't want to subject to the worldly views of having an abortion. I already don't want to be with this man anymore. I plan on going to court, getting child support from him and if he is granted his parental rights and allowed to see his child, only allowing him to see the baby when it's supervised.       however this is not the best situation that i am in either.   *i live with my mom   *i don't make a lot of money   *i'm in school.      I don't want to just give up on an innocent life who probably loves me sooo much right now. I love it, too. I just want to make the right decision. I know adoption will never be a decision that I'm able to make. I also know that eventually I'll finish school, get a good job and be able to provide everything necessary to raise a child in a good way. However, I have been told that it will scar my child to never know it's father. I don't want to give it up, but I think that after talking to everyone, maybe it's for the best. I just don't want to do anything that God would never forgive me for. I know that I am strong enough to handle this. I actually look forward to having someone to love unconditionally that will love me unconditionally as well. I look forward to having a purpose in my life. A reason to get up and do exactly what I'm supposed to do each and everyday. Because a completely helpless person is depending on me. But... I could just be being irrational. Everyone except like 5 people is telling me to get an abortion. Please tell me what you think.

This is how it happens we had an early release from school today so I got home at 10:30 am and was planning on going to my friends house but my mom had chores for me to do and i did them however I had an attitude about it and then I yelled at my mom and was being disrespectful and now I cannot go to my school's basketball game or my friends house tonight, which wouldn't be that big of a deal if it wasnt the last game that my friend is performing her poms routine and i was supposed to come 3 weeks in a row and now i cannot go and she will be mad at me.

20090220115628AAr31gd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Do you Think my child is Autistic?	MY daughter is two years old, She is late in her speech, she is supposed to be saying 50 words but all she says he mama(me), nana(my mom) daddy, papa (for eating), Gagoo (my brother I think she tries to say Matthew), she never throws tantrums, when she gets mad she scratches me or hits me. Not every single time though. When I call her name she does look at me but does not always. She does really well with kids she is very affectionate like gives kisses and hugs.  Once in a while she will hit another but I will tell her to be nice and give the other child a hug and a kiss and she will do it. She is a very fun child and smiles a lot and laughs. She was late to walk she didnt start walking till about 15 months but physical therapy helped he catch up very fast. She tries to have conversations with me but babbles alot. But you can tell she is trying to ask a question but the tone of her voice. She pretend plays like playing with her dolls acting like they are her babies and she kisses them and she will sit down on her little chair with her baby and her purse and she will get a book and act like she is reading. The teachers are worried because she does not point and she is late in her speech. and she does not always respond to her name. And she hits people when she gets mad. could it just be terrible 2's?

She is acting out in way a four year old doesn't act. She plays the wrong way with her barbies, i caught her one day and asked what they were doing and she said having "sex"/ and i asked where she knew that from and we got to talking and she said her and "   " played that game. and i know my four year old and she isn't like that. Me and my husband moved her away from that family but now she is really acting out.

20090220121001AAV2Mso	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Why is it so taboo to talk about fertility treatment?	A friend of mine who admitted she was having trouble getting pregnant, is now pregnant with twins. When I asked her if she did fertility treatments, she explained how twins run in the family (not true) I know she did the treatments so why isn't she just saying it. I don't understand why people are ashamed of it. I actually feel bad for people who do have twins naturally because everyone will assume it is fertility treatments and that the person won't talk about it.

20090203025920AALpHDy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What would be the consequences in school if i don't take my kids to their follow up session with the psych?	it was the school's idea to have them assessed. and sure enough, the result for both was ADHD.    i'm half-accepting and half-denying this (actually, more denying). in fact, i didn't take the doctor's recommendations seriously --like having them under meds and going into therapies over the tutorials they already have.    this is because, thanks to the school, my 5-year old --who is pretty hyper and has speech delay-- is improving well and can really memorize his lessons now. my 7-year old --who has a number and letter learning disability and is somewhat overemotional with a bit of low self esteem-- is improving, too.    but now, the school is asking for a follow up session with the doctor to check on these improvements. they did say my sons have made great strides so i don't see the point in returning to the doctor. and not now since i didn't follow much of her recommendations anyway. so what would be the point?    i've told the school my concern and they did agree that meds and the extra therapies are not necessary. but they still want to push for a follow up session or a new evaluation from a totally different psychologist.   do my kids really need this? if i don't pursue this, what could happen? i mean, they are doing great now.

20090220121146AAKX7cJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parent's Would you do this?	Since I was younger I saved every penny I ever got and my mom used to snatch it off of me and put it in the bank. I was very popular and had over 200 people at each of my birthday partys each year from age 6 onwards and I had a part time job for 13-16 and I put all that money in the bank and my grandparents and other family members also gave me lots of money which I had in the bank, so trust me I had a lot of money and my twin sister had the same amount. my mom and dad have spent every saving i've ever had, even the bit of money they saved up in our banks for college. and now I'm nearly 19 and I want to move out because my mom has got her friends over 24/7 and I just want to move out. they aren't even buying me my first car or anything. It's like i've got no support from they. out of all the money I had in my bank I've not even got $0.00   She let my brother keep his birthday money and everything each year! Just not me and my sisters................   and when I mention it to my parents they change the subject and get mad. Apparently my dad convinced my mom to let him spend it though so I don't know who to blame! They used it on some stupid crap and now I'm f***ed. And they WON'T give me the money back.      Parent's, would you spend your kids money without even caring?

20090220122240AAgQN4F	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What should I do about OVERBEARING PARENTS?	My parents always say that I'm not trying and that I am lazy and have no creativity and no chance into getting into an Ivy League school if I stay the way I am.       Yet I probably rank second out of all of my 8th grade, have All A's, and am probably the smartest guy. They say I do not read enough and that 8th grade is easy and that I will fail in high school and college if I do not constantly read.      My parents do not let me watch PG-13 movies (I am 14), I'm not allowed to have dates, my parents check my email constantly, and my parents are very overbearing at school and are overprotective also.      What should I do?      People say that this gives psychological problems.      My dad is a doctor.      BY THE WAY, I am Asian, so you can tell they are probably overprotective.

20090220132929AAZDwtZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby is refusing the breast?	I have been trying to relactate for the past week. I pump. At first hardly nothing came out, just tiny drops. Now I am seeing improvment there is actually some in the bottom of the bottle. Which I know this relactating process can be long. But I was advised to put baby to breast before each feeding just to get her used to it, try to get her to suck to stimulate the breasts even more than the pump. Well she does not like it, she turns her head away, pushes away with her hands, and if I do get her to open her mouth she wont latch on, she just keeps her mouth open and cries. I dont know what to do. I know right now I dont have a good enough supply to satisfy her but when I do how will I get her to take my breast any tips. What should I do?       Note: I stopped breastfeeding for 3 weeks and have been pumping for over a week. So its actually been 4 weeks since baby has been on the breast. Is it hopeless???      Also I called my local LLL and left a message but so far noone has called back that was 2 days ago. I am going to try again though.
20090220132359AACCdKE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	PCOS worries-- How did you know you had it?	I'm 18 years old, 19 in two months and I have a question. My friend referred me to this site and is letting me borrow her account.      I took the birth control pill for a little while starting in late 2007 and ending in August of 2008. It tooke me about 4 months to get a period again after I stopped the Pill ( I'm Catholic and got the Pill in secret.)      I had one period and now it's been two months since I've had that one. I've been reading into PCOS, since I'm a little overweight, but I don't really have any of the symptoms. I had regular periods before I started the Pill, and now I'm worried that I may have PCOS, because I'm not having normal periods anymore, like my doctor informed me that I would. I have cramping, but it's always on my side, like where my ovaries are... It'll be several months before I can get in to see my OBGYN, so could my GP run the tests for me? Or do I have to go to my OBGYN?      Can anyone with PCOS tell me how they came to think they might have it? How old were you? What was done about it? Did your doctor put you back on Birth Control? What were your warning signs?      I'm a little concerned, because I know a girl I graduated from highschool with who was informed she was infertile at 19... and I'm afraid of that happening to me.      Can anyone offer me advice? Or anything?      Please, I'd appreciate so much.

20090220131225AA0zt0l	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Doctor's office visit today?	I had my post partum visit with my OB/Gyn today and I had my baby with me.  The doctor was running an hour behind and well the baby who is 3 1/2 weeks old got cranky and hungry.  I fed him then he got gas.  There were maybe 4 people waiting, all who were pregnant.  You could hear my son passing gas from time to time.  This one lady said "Can you please take him to the other waiting room, you've been sitting here letting him cry and now he's passing gas and I don't feel like listening to it anymore."  I apologized and found another seat.        Then I got upset... this lady is about to have a child herself and couldn't handle my son crying for 2 min while I got a warm bottle for him, after I fed him he stopped crying, but did have gas.  Obviously I can't control when he's going to let one rip, and he's 3 1/2 weeks old he doesn't know any better!  The other people in the waiting room wanted to hold my son, play with him and didn't have a problem with it.        If you were in my shoes, would you have gotten up and moved, or stayed seated where you were?
20090220123945AAFfJZw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Money in the Piggy Bank?	I'm not working right now because I'm on maternity leave.  My husband has been supporting us, so we've had to cut back on some of the luxuries, which includes eating out.  Well, yesterday I went to pick up my step daughter from daycare and she asked if we could go to McDonalds.  (She actually calls it Old McDonalds, which is too cute!) I told her that we didn't have money for it right now because I'm not working and that we'd have supper at home.  She then said "Well, I have money in my piggy bank, can we use that to buy us supper?" I said "No, we're not spending your piggy bank money on that."  She got upset and was in a horrible mood all night.  It didn't feel right to me to have her spend her piggy bank money on McDonalds for us, she's only 4 and doesn't understand that it would have been more than a few pennies or nickels to buy all of us supper.   She has several piggy banks full but I just felt like as an adult it's my responsibility to feed her and not use her money.       Am I being too hard on myself and break down and let her buy us supper, or just come home and eat since we have plenty of food here?

My son uses an empty bottle for a pacifier, he has since he was 4 months old, he has always refused a regular pacifier, his doctors encouraged it at first because he has GERD and has trouble falling asleep without it. Now that he is getting older, I want to break the habbit to prevent any problems with his teeth.  I have tried every binky under the son and he wants nothing to do with them, he still has trouble sleeping, but I want him to find a new way to comfort himself. We took away the bottle completely last night and a screamed for 3 hours and then finally passed out. But he will not take a nap now, he has been 2 days without a nap. Am I doing this right? My husband at first just gave him the nipple of a bottle and he was fine with using that as a pacifier, but that is still bad for his teeth isn't it? Should I ween him off of it slowly? How do I do this?

20090203033736AAnVCPm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Really sore breasts, possible reasons? Please help?	Okay so I have been experiencing alot of uncommon feelings that I do not typically get. First my period started on the 12th of Jan. and ended on the 17th. The flow was normal and nothing seemed unusual. Around the 27th I started to have very strong soreness in my breasts. I have tried to do a bit of research but cant seem to find the answers. My husbands mother who is a nurse said it can happen because of caffeine however I don't think I have consumed any more or less caffeine then usual. My husband and I are not TTC but are not on birth control and practice sex on a regular basis. I read that it can happen to some women during ovulation however this is not normal to me. If this was the case how long does it typically last? I am now 9 days before period with still very sore breast. They are so sore to the touch that I cannot even lay on them without feeling pain. Also the last two days I have been having flu like symptoms such as fatigue and sore neck and just my entire head hurting. I am really stumped for answers so besides waiting it out to take a pregnancy test.. are their any other reasons to match up with my symptoms? Thanks so much for all your help in advance!

20090220132517AALjQd0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Was i abused as a child?	My teacher was talking about how she was abused as a kid and it sparked a lot of memories for me.      However, i'm not sure if this is abuse-- or normal..   I remember my dad getting so mad at me for something i did that when he got angry and started to yell i would run in my room and lock the door. He would sometimes break the door knob to get in there to "spank" me with his belt. I remember one time when i made a comment to someone about how he spanked me so hard it left bruises and he told me later "don't tell people about that." I never really considered it abuse though because i always ticked him off in someway. I also remember times he would push me so hard i would fly across the room and hit the wall, and times when he pushed me down once by my bathtub and took his belt off and whipped me while i pleaded him to stop. He broke 3 doorknobs trying to get in to do this kind of stuff. Which as i grow older-- doesn't seem right. If i ran into my room why did he need to break the door to hit me. Why couldn't he have just let me stay in there. Somestimes- as i got a little older- if he would chase me and was about to hit me i would grab the closest thing to threaten him with. For instance- once i grabbed a bottle of windex and said i would squirt him if he got to close. He terrified me. Was i abused?

20090220124740AAYHwsb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is it hard for you to admit, you're human?	As parents, we are sometimes held to higher standards than people without children. I can freely admit I am not perfect and have flaws.      I have a terrible temper and while I can reign it in most of the time, there are occasional moments where I can't resist what some thing to be innappropriate behavior whether it be speculating about the octuplut mom, leaving a store my child threw up in without cleaning it up, but alerting the staff to its presence, stapler throwing, etc.      So... Am I the only one or are there other humans out there?
20090220121702AA0esIG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why is it inappropriate for teens of the opposite sex to stay in the same room?	Hi, I'm a 13 year old boy and I have been alone in rooms with girls.      Contrary to popular belief, we didn't even think about sexual activity of any sort (unless hugging and kissing her forehead is one).       Neither my nor her parents find this inappropriate, and neither do we. We have been good friends for the best part of my life. Both of her (elder) brothers trust me as well. My older brother doesn't really care. Her younger sister doesn't even know.      I just want to know why people don't let their kids stay in the same room with the opposite sex?       Oh, and before you ask, yes, were BOTH in puberty. But that doesn't actually change anything (males have a testosterone spike at 9:00AM, so that's the only time they would have "raging hormones").      PS: WE DO NOT SLEEP IN THE SAME BED.
20090220142214AAvazko	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Croup! Please help me!?	Hello everyone,      My 2 year old baby son has croup but it's a somewhat mild case. I called his doctor and they said there's nothing they do for them unless they're struggling to breathe, then they give them some kind of steroid medication to open them up. He acted like my son's case didn't warrant that and just said give him Tylenol and wait a few days, warned me it gets worse at night so leave the window open to let the cool air in like I did last night. That's about it.        But it's the weekend, as you all know, and I'm uneasy about not doing ANYTHING about it. What if it gets worse? Plus, the doctor may be right about it not being as bad as it could be, but I just hate to see my little boy sick and I'd like to do something for him.      I've given him Tylenol for his fever, and I get him to drink a little water and Pedalite every couple hours, and whenever it gets bad at night I know you're supposed to either get them in a steamy room or take them out into the cool night air, but other than that I don't know any good home remedies to help ease his discomfort and get him through this.      Does anyone know of anything else I should be doing to help him? He's got the croupy, barking cough and running a fever. If that's all I can do, that's fine, but if anyone else has any suggestions they are much appreciated.      Thanks to all.

20090220121345AArmF11	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is it ok to have a different way of putting my 9 month old to nap and to bed at night?	My 9 month old takes two naps during the day. He usually gets drowsy in his swing then nods off as we are walking him to his bed. He also uses a pacifier for naps. At bedtime though he doesn't use a pacifier and goes directly into his bed. Should we be putting him to sleep the same way? Does it confuse him that he goes to sleep one way for naps, and then has to go to sleep a different way for bedtime? Should we start not using the swing for naps and taking away his pacifier?      I only worry because he's on a schedule and it takes a lot longer for him to fall asleep at night than for naps. If it takes as long to fall asleep at naps as it does bedtime, he'd only get like an hour of real during the day.

20090220122534AAoxTuc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Is this fair that my mom does this to my friends?	Okay, so, I used to live in this really rich neighbourhood, then my mom and step dad broke up, lost lots of money etc etc. So I had to move in with my grandma while my mom works and makes enough money to be able to support us again. My grandma doesn't live in the richest area and my mom considers it dirt poor compared to where we used to live. I had a bunch of great friends where I used to live and we would hang out all the time and she never had a problem with it. Now that I live here with my grandma, I have friends but she never lets me go out with them. On the weekends when I want to hang out with them, she says "Well, why don't you go call on your other friends? I really don't like you hanging around with these people." She has never met my friends, they are not bad, never had a bf, never drank, no drugs, no sex etc. I don't know what her problem is. Is it fair that she discriminates them because they aren't as rich as my other friends? Sometimes on the weekend, she will take my around where I used to live just for like drives and stuff, when I tell her it's pretty boring and I want to go back to grandma's or something, she says that she wants me to see the west end because its "Good for me". What is her problem? There is nothing wrong with poor people lots of them are really great people, some MUCH better than the snobs where I used to live, not that my richer friends aren't GREAT but so are my new friends.       Do you think this is unfair?      OH and, my mom grew up in this exact same house / neighborhood and she didn't turn out so well, she got pregnant as a teenager and got into drugs, obviously she got better. I don't think she understands that we are not the same, she got kicked out of elementary school, I got straight A's, she had an older bf at 14, I have never even kissed a boy.

20090220124141AAzgI0g	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	A 23 year old with 5 kids....?	My friend, love her to death, is 23 years old and she has four boys and one infant girl. All of her children are under the age of six years old. WOW...I know.    Anyways, she is not really being a responsible parent. She is on state aid of course but she takes advantage of it. For instance...selling her food stamps for cash. Say 60 dollars in groceries for 50 dollars cash so she can pay her cell phone bill or go out and drink.    She wanted me to claim her kids so she could get money. I have no kids so I told her no because I don't want that to come back and haunt me when I do have a child. She is getting section 8 as well. Rules are that you can not have anyone spend the night or live in your home. She has people in and out of her apt. constantly as well as 2-3 people spending the night all the time. This has resulted in her losing her apt. and her section 8. Where are her and her 5 kids going to stay now?       Why would she make these choices knowing what the consequences are? I don't understand. She moves in and out of her grandpas place but he is getting tired of her not taking responsibility of her choices. He is old, on oxygen and can't take 5 kids running aroung screaming and pulling toys everywhere for him to trip on. How can I talk to her about this? I need to let her know that she has to do something for herself or the state will be trying to latch on to her kids if she keeps this up...help
20090220125742AA74SC8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	What would be a good middle name for the name Caleb?	If I have a boy, I was really thinking about naming him Caleb... but I can't think of any good middle names.      Since I don't know if I'm giving the baby my last name or the father's last name, it's hard to find one that goes with them both. I was thinking about Caleb Michael, but that doesn't really go with my last name.       (Feel free to suggest pretty UNCOMMON first names, also. I'm not 100% sure about Caleb, yet.

20090220123731AAA9onR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you think little boys or girls are worse when it comes to animals?	As far as scaring them and bugging them.      We have noticed it seems that Girls are the worst....my dogs are terrified of little girls. Because they have that high pitched squeal when they see a dog and then they run up and try to hug on it and smother it. Little girls are way worse boys in my opinion      We avoid all little girls like the plague...but little boys tend to be able to ask to pet the dog and the dogs love little boys.   They are just calmer by nature it seems.   It seems little boys can read the dog better and know when to stop.      Where little girls keep pestering and wanted to cuddle the dog even if the dog is growling at them.      I never let any child pet our dogs without asking and without them giving our pet a treat.      But I try to avoid children that we don't know coming near our dogs anyways because I trust my dogs but I don't trust these kids.      If its a child we know the dogs and the child can play together (supervised all they want)      I know our dogs prefer boys over girls.      What do you think

I guess I just can't see myself with a daughter.      I mean I guess I just always thought I would have a boy if I had a kid.  You know.      Even when I was younger and I played with dolls my baby doll was a boy most of the time (it was just a little bald headed doll with a white outfit)      I really want a boy.    And I shouldn't want a boy over a girl.   I should want either.      I've always been real good with boys...but not at all with girls.   It seems I can get more on a boys level then girls.....      I don't really like girly activites like dressing up, makeup.      I'd prefer to be outside with the dogs, 4 wheeling, riding horses.      I'd rather play cowboys and indians than barbies (or whatever dolls are popular now)      We even have a nice boy name picked out (Sawyer Lee)       But I can't even think of good girl names (we are still just TTC but we have talked about names)      But my question is if I don't have a boy will I be upset?   Or will all be forgotton when I hold my daughter?         Thanks

20090220121925AAEt4pf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you think that birth order affects...?	a persons personality?  I have been thinking about this today because I was told that I am not very good at sharing (this is really true) and someone asked me what # child I am, and I said the baby- they said "figures!"      I do realize that I am stingy in certain areas, and am used to getting my way in pretty much every aspect of my life.  My sons father, however, is the oldest and he is very good at sharing and really likes to do things to make others happy.      I have also dated a guy that was the baby and it did not work out well ar all!  Our personalities seemed to clash!  I used to tell him "even though you are the baby too you don't get your way because I am the girl and that trumps birth order!"      What do you guys think?

Summer isn't far off, and we've all heard of infants/small children who are left in vehicles. :( I was curious what you would do, if you saw a baby or child in a car, on a hot day, obviously sweating, perhaps crying, perhaps not... Would you run in and try to find the parent? Alert a worker of wherever it is you are? Call the police? Break the window and take the child out? I know many people who tell a worker, who then calls the police, but, that takes time, and as we all know, every minute counts!       Here's hoping we don't hear ANY stories like this, this year.

20090220144923AA6oTvM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why do people want their babies/children to grow up quickly?	It always seems like people want to be in a competition when it comes to children. I get asked questions like "has your baby rolled yet?" "does she sit up", "does she eat food" So I answer and they always follow up with a "well my so-and-so did this at that age and blah blah blah"    Usually I really don't care since I want my babies to stay as young for as long as possible, and only take their questions as a sign that they would like to relate to me. But I have an uncensored mouth and usually say smart *** things that usually get me in trouble. Like when this lady said yea my son was eating regular food at 6 months I said oh wow thats why hes so fat.    anyways i'm in no rush to get my 5 month old to read yet

20090220140847AAR6rwi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	TTC...I'm on my period :o/ When is it my turn? I'm frustrated HELP! Suggestions?	Ok, Sorry for this lengthy question but I'm giving some extra information on my history as well as some concerns I have.      So DH & I have been ACTIVELY trying to conceive since 10/2008. We have been having unprotected sex for over 8 1/2 years.  I don't have any children.    However, I've had 2 unplanned pregnancies. The 1st was in June of 2001 & I miscarried after 12 weeks due to an auto accident.  The 2nd was in February of 2003 & miscarried again after 8 weeks due to a fall off a bicycle.    Again both pregnancies were unplanned & therefore when I miscarried although it was sad, I wasn't too concerned b/c I was too young anyway.    Now, I'm very desperate. I cry myself to sleep b/c we both want a baby so bad & it hasn't happened.   Ok, so both my DH & I have been tested for infertility and  we're both fine, my prior miscarriages were due to a exterior cause nothing that was produced within my body so my ob/gyn is sure that I will have no probs conceiving. I know I haven't been ACTIVELY trying for too long (10 or 2008), but gees it just seem like forever to us! We've had unprotected sex since my last miscarriage in 2003 and haven't gotten pregnant!   What is wrong with me? How can I get pregnant? I've been charting my menstrual cycles, BBT, Cervical Fluid, etc. I'm registered on Babycenter.com, twoweekwait.com, & FertilityFriend.com etc   I feel I am very educated in the TTC department. What am I doing wrong? I BD every other day prior to ovulation and the day of ovulation.  It's frustrating because I am pretty regular with my periods, I usually get it the 21st of every month give or take a day max! This month I got it on the 18th! WTH???   So I check ovulation calendars online to get my fertile days and those days vary on every site.  DH and I decided to have sex every other day except when I'm on my period. I don't want to have sex everyday because I read about the whole sperm count and mobility or whatever.   Now I'm frustrated because I feel like I've always been regular with my periods and feel like getting it early is screwing my charting all up and now my fertile days are different & I just feel lost and confused.   I feel like buying OPK, but then I don't want to waste my money cause I heard negative things such as if the test shows a surge in LH it doesn't necesarily mean its accurate and I heard and read that just because you get a positive line, doesn't mean you're ovulating it's so darn confusing and I wish it really worked and I'd buy it, but I don't want to waste money on something that gives you inaccurate results.   What are your thought? Can someone help me? Any advice?

20090220141943AAyRTfM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Divorced and seperated parents, can you give me your input?	Okay, I'll just give you this scenario, and if you could just let me know if you are coming from the mother's or father's point of view, and what you would do, and why you would do it:            Boy and girl have baby and become mom and dad at ages 15 and 16. Dad quits school to work, mom finishes high school. 4 years later mom wants another baby, dad says okay. Mom and dad have another baby at ages 19 and 20. They get married. Dad is still working, mom gets job too. Couple years go by and suddenly mom started starts partying, lying, cheating, and spending less and less time with family when she turns 21. Dad puts up with it for awhile, then asks for divorce. Within 2 weeks mom is moved out and living with a new boyfriend. Dad goes on with his simple life, working, taking care of kids, camping, and fishing. Mom is still partying.  Mom will not sign divorce papers, and still relies on dad heavily for emotional support, and other things ( fixing things, ect.) Almost 2 years go by, things are still the same. Dad meets a woman who is on the right track, and is a single mom, doing great for herself and child. He settles down with her. Meanwhile, mom breaks up with boyfriend of 2 years, and is jealous of dad's new girlfriend,and that he is no longer by her side for help. Another 2 years goes by, mom has several different live in boyfriends. She was engaged to a couple of them, told the kids that "this one" will be their "new" dad. Dad is still taking care of the kids, spending a lot of family time with his kids, is fiance's kid, and then, he has a baby with his fiance'.  Mom fianlly signs divorce papers, and they agree to two things: #1 50/50 custody (which it had been since they split) #2 Neither parent can move out of state in which the children were born, unless they leave the children there.  Mom meets another guy. Marries him after 7-8 months. Guy seems nice. Since then, kids do not enjoy spending too much time at dad's because they are spoiled with video games, movies, and toys by mom and new step dad. Now mom has transformed into a very hands on mom, and is no longer partying. However, now mom is blocking dad out of their life as much as she can. Mom is telling kids to call step dad "dad" and dad by his first name. Now mom wants to move away with the kids to step dad's home town. (about a 10 hour plane ride away).     End scenario.       Moms, would you take your children away from their father who loves them, spends time with them, takes care of them, and supports them?  Would you create a new family and put someone else in your children's father's spot, just because you found someone new?          Dads, what would you do? Would you be completely heart broken and not let your kids go? Or, would you let them go, knowing that they will have a chance at a "normal" life? You know, no more going back and forth from mom's house to dad's house, just have a one home with a mom and a dad even though the dad would actually be the step dad?       Thank you for your time!

20090220142717AAOJXDP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I'm very concerned and need some advise.?	My 4 1/2 month old has been eating very poorly and throwing up for 5 days now. Before this started she was eating 5 oz bottles ever 3- 3 1/2 hours. Now she will only eat 2 oz at a time. When this started 5 days ago, she would only throw up once a day. now she has had 3 vomiting spells in the last 24 hours one of which lasted 30 minutes. She threw up then waited a few minutes then would start crying and screaming and would throw up again. Once she had thrown everything up she continued dry heaving.       We have gone the to doctor monday and tuesday about this. in the 24 hours between visits she had lost 2 oz of her weight. She only weighed 11 lbs 11 oz and went down to 11/9. Her Dr did blood work and everything came back ok.       She was still not eating and throwing up Wednesday so I called her dr and she had her admitted to the children's hospital. She stayed there 24 hours for monitoring. They did no tests at all. she was still having at least 4 wet diapers and did not act like she was in pain when she wasn't throwing up. They said she has acid reflux and as long as she is not loosing any weight she is OK. They gave her medicine to reduce the acid in her stomach and told me to add rice to her formula.       I had a follow up with her regular doctor this morning and they weighed her. She told me to try soy formula in case it was a milk allergy. She ate a 3 oz bottle when we came home, then 2 hours later was hungry again and ate 2 more oz. About 45 minutes after that second bottle was when she started the 30 minute puking episode. It was enough to cover her, her swing, me and 2 full size bath towels. I called her dr. again who told me to go back to the milk base formula and to call her Monday and let her know how it is going.       I'm just so worried this is going to continue over the weekend and she is going to get sicker and sicker. I'm alone here with her. I have no family even remotely nearby and I'm just really worried. Has anyone else dealt with this or have any ideas what could be going on?

Now having said all that, any ideas on themes for the party? Any ways to include my 2 1/2 yr old so he doesn't feel like all the attention is on the baby? Once again, I AM NOT EXPECTING/WANTING GIFTS, it's more about welcoming the new baby!!!
20090220151731AAKjF8p	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What is enough formula to give a 3 month old?	Hello, my daughter is 3 months old and I recently increased her formula intake from 4 to 6 oz every 3-4 hours. But ever since I've increased her formula intake she sleeps alot more. She used to stay up the majority of the day but now, after every feeding she falls asleep for 1-2 hours at a time.  She's still sleeping through the night but I wanted to know if this is normal or if I should decrease her intake back to 4 oz. The reason I increased her intake is because she was still hungry after the 4 oz. Thank You.

20090220122538AA42QfK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Son's inverted penis?!?	My son is 12 weeks old and I was concerned about his PeePee "disappearing" inside of him. The foreskin seems to get pushed over his penis head. If you push back on the foreskin the head pops out. I asked the pediatrician about this and she didn't seem concerned at all and kinda just said.."oh ya...thats an innie..but he'll grow into it when he loses his baby fat"...I am still kinda freaked out and I don't know if I need to get a 2nd opinion or not. I do have a chubby baby...14 lbs at 12 weeks with lotsa rolls...but I just don't want him to have problems down the road. We had him circumcised for a reason...and want it to be corrected if it needs be. I was wondering if any moms have had a similar experience with their son and if so what was the outcome?!? Any help would be great! Thank you!

Now I am worried about my feelings and whether they will make me a bad Mom to my children. I love my stepson but I wouldn't miss him if contact was stopped. I know thats horrible but thats just the way I feel.      So does this mean I'll feel this way to my children when I have them? I mean will I be a bad Mom or do you feel different when you have your own? Someone once told me MOST people don't give a toss about other peoples children but would do ANYTHING for their own. Is this true?       I haven't had my own children yet so I don't know. Don't just shout at me, please can I have some good points of view here I don't wanna have children if I won't be a good Mom? :)

Yea I understand that we are irresponsible for not telling them and she's already 5 months pregnant. We both understand she needs to see a doctor, but what we really need help with is some ideas on how to tell her parents. She's 16 I'm 17 with two kids on the way (hers and someone else who is do in 5 days). The only thing we truly like for an idea is telling them at dinner in a public place so they can't overreact. THe problem is we can't come up with any reasons or "special occasions" for her parents to take us out to dinner. Her parents are Catholic and we just don't know how to tell them. Please any ideas would be helpful. We're scared but ready to grow up and accept our consequences but we would like some advise.

My son is now 2.5 months, I love him so much.      I have started work this past week, and I have been so STRESSED out.  You cannot imagine how the whole drop-my-son at the nursery until pick-my-son from the nursery process has been.      On top of that I have been having so much to do when he wakes up in the morning to eat and after it I start packing his bag, and then I would get ready with my husband to leave to work.  I have been so worried to the extent that I stop the car twice to check on my son because he is still so small and his neck folds so I get scared!! I pull up my son from the bad posture and again drive.      I drop him at 8am and leave to work and start at 8.30am.  I finish at 3.30pm, reach my son at 4pm and reach home at 4.30pm.  My son is the last baby in the daycare so my heart is broken :( when I see him      The salary can live up a whole family, and the benefits are so good.  I dont know how to manage, or how to make up a decision.  I only think of the salary bec of my son and my future children, its all for them.. with all the high cost living nowadays, I am so lucky to get this good offer, but its just too much, i have lost my sanity since I started work. :(      What should I do? Please advice me from both, ur heart and brain.. coz if I think from my heart I say my son is more imp, but from mind, I say I can sacrifice and work.  But I know I cannot win everything, so I have to make a decision.      I forgot to add that my husband has a really good job, and his salary is way too good to be true, we can live a modest life, thank God, but we know that 2 incomes are better than 1.      Help me please, I am losing my mind

I've been solely nursing my little boy since he was born, he's not interested in drinking from a bottle, but using them as a chew toy. thought this would help but he doesn't drink much.      the point is, that I suspect damage to my areolas and nipples, mostly the one, and it has always made it difficult for him to eat from my left breast, so for 5mths, he's been eating just from the right breast.       I cannot pump and cannot express. I do leak during feedings, and have been taking advantage of it to help ease the other breast.       I want to get him onto bottles but nothing at all is working... :(((      I know that with my hubby's help I might be able to get them roughly balanced, but not sure how long that would take.

I have been pumping every 3 hours during the day (20-25 minutes, double pump), but sleeping between the hours of 10:30 pm and about 6:30 am.  I got some nasty flu Monday night (to day is Friday) that lasted a couple of days and could barely sit up long enough to pump.  I also became a bit dehydrated.  As a result, my milk supply has depleted (about 4.5-5 oz vs the usual 6-8 per session).  I've been pumping every 2-3 hours now, and have also begun to wake up at about 3 or 4 am to fit in an extra pumping session, and have FINALLY been able to eat and drink more.  Is it too soon to be worried about his being a permanent depletion?  Should I just wait and continue doing what I'm doing?  Will my supply slowly pick back up?  Also, some one told me that drinking a single beer a couple of nights a week can help w/ milk production.  Is this true?
