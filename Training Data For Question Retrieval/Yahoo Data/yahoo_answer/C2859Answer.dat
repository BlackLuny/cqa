You'll find it on many good Italian restaurant menus.  Carbonara, at least how it is served in the US, usually has bacon, cheese and cream in it.  It usually has eggs in the sauce as well, I do not know if Pizza Hut includes eggs or not.    So they aren't too far off from carbonara  with their macaroni and cheese with bacon.      A place like Pizza Hut knows who their customers are - and I doubt most of PH customers would know what carbonara  is, so they use a more American name of "macaroni and cheese with bacon."    Also the word "natural" has no standardized meaning in US Advertising unless it is used to describe cheese..  It is a non-regulated advertising term for everything else but cheese..  So they use it to differentiate the new pizza from their other pizzas.  Just because something is not advertised as natural doesn't mean it is artificial - they are not always opposites.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	believe it or not allot of those commercials do fool people into going there  i mean just try a slice of pizza huts pizza and then get a slice from a new york city pizzeria and you will be amazed just how bad pizza hut is   but kids were bought up eating pizza hut and think it is what pizza is suppose To taste like   so they are doing the same with the italian food|`|AA11091315	Yeah, those commercials are totally bogus.

yJSPecgoaa	Cape Cod Chicken is a chicken recipe that uses cranberries.  Whole berry cranberry sauce is mixed with soy sauce, lemon and butter, heated and poured over the chicken before baking.  The recipe has been around for a while, so there have been different variations over the years, but what follows is the recipe I use.  It's really good.    CAPE COD CHICKEN    1 box Uncle Bens Original Long Grain and Wild Rice (comes with its own herb package)  1/2 c. chicken bouillon  3 tbsp. butter  1 tbsp. lemon juice  2 tbsp. soy sauce  1 can whole berry cranberry sauce  1 frying chicken (2 1/2 to 3 lbs.), cut up   (but not skinned or boned, or else there wont be enough moisture to cook the rice)    Mix rice, package of seasonings, and bouillon. Spread in the bottom of a buttered 13 x 9 inch baking pan. Arrange chicken pieces on top of the rice, skin side up. Heat cranberry sauce, butter, lemon and soy sauce in a saucepan. Pour over the chicken and rice. Cover tightly with foil. Bake at 325 degrees for 1 hour and 10 minutes. Uncover and bake for 10 minutes more.|`|VWLtJoX2aa	I was going to say it was chicken from Long John Silvers but apparently it's chicken rolled up with stuffing inside.|`|BoqbYQ1Naa	Never heard of it, but you can google it.

AA11759382	IDK.  The few times it's happened to me, the first server would be like, i'm leaving in five minutes, here's the check (note we haven't got the food yet) and so and so will take over.|`|JfVxCDb7aa	They are supposed to spit it.|`|HA8Ehs3Gaa	I don't have the answer but that is a really good question. I would have never thought to ask that. That has happened more than once.|`|k8HpMaHxaa	Where I work it depends.    If server 1 reallyy wants to get out of there, we will usually forfeit the tip to do so.     Sometimes it depends on how far along the table was. If server 1 only wrote the order and put it in, and server 2 served the meal and all, then server 2 gets the tip.     And more often then not, we split the tip.|`|g4APbW4Naa	As I diner, I wouldn't even worry about it - what difference does it make in the end?    The restaurant might put all the tips in a pool to be shared by all the servers.  But if not, my opinion is that if a server goes home, and doesn't finish serving me, they might as well forfeit the tip.|`|AA10804824	Most servers will wait for the tip. If not, and I am server 2, what if you sit for another HOUR drinking coffee & chatting. I still have to keep an eye on you, the tip is mine. That has happened more often than you would think- server 1's table stays longer than server 2's.    But, really, let them worry about it. Still tip 18% if your service was good.|`|4H6Hfh7xaa	Personally i think its the one that finishes serving you|`|QnnmJEuraa	If your food server goes home you before you leave, which usually means you're sitting at their table for entirely too long, you better tip the them (your first server).  It's rude not too.  Make sure you give them something and tell them specifically that it is for them.  Servers don;t make hardly any other money.  They live off of your tips.|`|JrC2KGOQaa	They probably work it out in much the same way salespeople do when more than one have assisted you.|`|FecoGS68aa	The server that you paid keeps the tip.|`|mAGe6dwBaa	I think that the new food server should get the tip because if the first waiter wanted the money he/she would've stayed|`|AA10593529	Sometimes the servers will split the tips but usually the one you pay keeps the tip.|`|xc5fhhCAaa	if i were somewhere and server 1 left while i was dining, and server 2 took over, i don't think that i would tip at all.  it is just rude to leave while your table is eating their meal.  so in the end, you yourself get the tip and go out for a drink or two at the end!|`|kedcv0glaa	I think that's so rude. If you have a table, then you stay there and finish serving them until they leave. I have never worked at a restaurant that allowed a server to go home when she had other tables and let someone else take over. Unless it was an emergency. I was waiting tables on Father's Day when I thought I was going to go into labor and the manager took over my tables and I got to keep the money from the ones I started. But if they just feel like going home, I think that's rude. If that happened to me at a restaurant, I would leave a decent tip but probably never go back to that restaurant. It makes people feel unwelcome, like you are keeping servers there when they don't want to be, even though it is their job.

The side are great and the BLACK Berry cobbler ( yea I know usually that would suck) with Ice Cream oh my god get you spoon off my bowl.

I F*ckin love that place the original one ( In Driftwood)is really the best and the one in the airport is pretty good!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG okay well if you can get the all you can eat family style dinner that has a little of everything  but I'm a real sausage guy so I like that the most If I must get 1 thing, the brisket and prok ribs are pretty good 2. The sauce is critical. Anyways the potato salad is legit as well as the peach cobbler with ice cream. You are sooo lucky you get to go <br>  <br>  But if you want the best in Texas head out to lockhart which is 45 minutes away and go to smitty's, the sausage and brisket are really good especially the fatty sausage.<br>  <br>  I Look for in a REAL BBQ place<br>  - No silverware<br>  -No plates just paper<br>  - Kind of dirty but not tooo bad<br>  - smoker<br>  - And getting in and out in 30 minutes|`|p2G5KJywaa	Salt Lick's got one of the best reputations in Texas. What do I look for. Side of the road joints with a pit you can see and smell. Not too big of a crowd. Good prices and quick service.

See what they cook with.<br>  <br>  Hey, I own a bbq joint and cooked competitively for several years. Finally quit everything else altogether and that's how I make a living now. All low and slow smoked with pecan/oak blend of seasoned hardwood. Sauce on the side if you even want any. Best brisket in Texas.

I like bbq that fall of the bone. Where you live will have a sauce that is for that area. Some like a dry rub others like a wet rub when cooking ribs. I like a dry rub and apply the sauce about half hour before meat is done.|`|vigFmfLmaa	Smoke!  If there's no smoke coming out of the back of the joint, keep driving!  So many places call themselves BBQ joints and grill, broil, bake or even OMG the horror boil their meats.  If you want good BBQ find a place with an old smoker out back and sauce on the table.  Don't go to a place that drowns your pig in sauce before it comes to your table.  They're just trying to cover up the lack of flavor and tenderness.

We have variety and it's all really good, kids are just unwilling.     Chicken sandwiches, spicy chicken sandwiches, dinner plates like fried chicken and mashed potatoes, cheeseburgers, salads, cold sandwiches, burritos, and pizza.    Seriously?     : /|`|K6XZ18uHaa	my schools food is pretty good especially the cookies!|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Yes, the nasty microwaveable beef and bean TB burritos were horrid.  Also the cheeseburgers were like rubber patties.  Chicken nuggets were steamed pieces of chicken particles that had chewy chunks of fat in them, bagels were hard as a rock, then all served with tater tots.  Tater tots were the only good thing, not even good really.  Our school tried to make it palatable by crunching up a bag of cheddar sour cream ruffles, then getting a bagel, dipping it in cream cheese, then dipping that in the ruffles crumbs.  For some reason it was sort of tasty.|`|WngxQDiaaa	When I was in school i loved school lunch....but this was years ago.|`|78DfeVSOaa	What can you do about it?

Is it dietary or for health reasons?  If so, maybe you can make your own pizza at home.  Otherwise, that's what friends are for.
