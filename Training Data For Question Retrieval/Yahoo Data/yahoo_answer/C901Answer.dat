Each state is different regardling legality of working with (or without) your REALTOR, google your state's "real estate commission" to read more.<br>  <br>  3. The BEST way to "fire" someone in the industry is to let your agreement with them expire and not make any moves.  Most listing agreements expire around 120 days, buyer agreements are agreed upon when signing.<br>  <br>  4. If you have signed anything (if you're buying), you only have to continue working with them if you have written a contract on a home and their name is on it.  If you haven't signed anything, you might be in the clear.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
5Ey2siHNaa	I often tell people who are relocating to consider carefully their wants and needs (as clearly you are)- how amazing that you are willing to take this adventure and move cross country.<br>  <br>  The best website to find all of this information is: <a href="http://www.bestplaces.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestplaces.net/</a>  No REALTOR can opine about "safety" or "good schools" because those terms are subjective- I might think something is safe and if your window gets smashed you call and yell at me for putting you in an "unsafe" neighborhood, you know?  So, look here for subjective answers, then ask Real Estate related questions to your REALTOR (and I highly advise using a REALTOR in any transaction to save you time and money)!|`|qSoTwnr9aa	Tennessee would be the place I would look or Kentucky

For a first start without any business experience I would look into franchising. You would need start up money, but you would have a known business to hold your hand. Not all franchises are expensive. As far as loans are concerned, most of them want some kind of collateral, or assurance that the loan will be paid off. Either by seizing your property, having a co-signer, or something to prove that you are a good credit risk. Good Luck|`|AA10179912	I would suggest for someone with limited experience that you look more towards the pool hall idea, as it has less labor costs and outlay, and not as much worry about food, kitchen and hygiene. It would be very hard, very long hours, no holidays. Remember 80% of new businesses fail in the first two years, and if the idea of working 8-12 hours days, 7 days a week with no holidays for a year or more is unreasonable or shocking to you, then don't start it. Also get a job in these businesses for experience, as the idea can be very different to the real deal and to learn names of suppliers, how the layout of things should be, it can make the set up a lot easier and saves you many hours of sourcing your own information . Coffee is also an intricate product and takes some skill, practice and knowledge to make the "good stuff". Most business loans are at least a 50% deposit due to the high risk, and you will need a excellent business plan and stats.

52526b559c45eb57204a29b41ddd8553aa	Your market is saturated with distressed sellers and investor activity there is focused on deep discounts.  You should have all purchase and sale agreements made subject to attorney review as investors often use their own forms with ambigious terms and disclaimers. Detriot has lost over 1/3 of its population it had 30 years ago.  Some areas still have stable prices, but as a whole, the Detroit / Windsor markets are taking a severe beating.  Investors often avoid real estate listings because agents see through their smoke screen and can point out the many escapes they write into their deals.  In other cases some investors avoid agents because they dont see agents as competent enough to understand their creative terms and conditions.  I  would submit whether it is an agent written offer or an investor offer trust no one until a competent real estate attorney has cleaned it up for you.|`|1e276cf277894bd2387532152b4db7a6aa	In trying to keep my answer short, If I were the investor looking to buy your property, what would a realtor have to do with it?

It's a tough market everywhere in the state and less and less investors are willing to invest in our state. I would not encourage you to take it off the public market. If your Realtor has it listed on the local MLS that is your best opportunity to sell it. The only way investors are going to buy the house is if they talk you below the market value anyways. At least if you are working with a Realtor that knows what they are doing they can lend a hand in making sure you are not overlooking important details that could bite you in the end. The house will sell eventually no matter what condition or area it is in as long as all other realtors can find it when they do have a buyer looking for what you have to offer. Good luck!
52526b559c45eb57204a29b41ddd8553aa	Your HOA has a board and it is their responsibility to have a management company provide maintenance services and property repairs and upgrades.  Your board is in non compliance by not having monthly meetings and I am surprised the lender accepted their resale certificate.  In those declarations will be their rules and regulations.  It seems your board could be ousted for neglect and a new one elected.  As for members not paying dues for over a year, and dues being held months before depositing them is also gross neglect.  As board member's with a fiduciary duty to the homeowners association their neglect of duty and timeliness has caused financial harm, property devaluation, and several legal violations.  Hold a homeowners meeting yourself and remove these people immediately.  Then hold open meetings once per month, and hire a landscape company to clean up the grounds.  Hire a licensed and bonded contractor to repair siding and painting.  Get bids for repaving, and make the old board account for every cent collected before taking their ledgers away.  In Oregon a homeowners association can foreclose on a place over delinquent dues.  Maybe you can there also, if so, start the process.  This "good ole boy club" has got to go, you will be hated by a few and then respected by most as positive change starts to improve the development.|`|fe1a69ec9fc7fb7631a59c2ecba7dccdaa	This is a serious problem that is growing around the country.  There are good associations and bad associations and there is no oversight of them.  You need to read your bylaws carefully.  See if there is a provision to have the board members removed.  Often, if they do not pay their own dues they may be removed.  Chances are if they are not enforcing the rules on others they are not paying their own.  If that doesn't work you will have to get some good legal advice in your area.  Find an attorney that understands condominium law, not just any attorney.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|YfTI7Byhaa	Get involved, replace the current board and officers.

I would recommend getting some of your neighbors together to force a vote to elect some new members to the board.

From there you can certainly look at legal action if they do not follow up with your requests.

52526b559c45eb57204a29b41ddd8553aa	You would need to invest the cash saved into something that yields better performance than what it would give you as buydown.  In a soft market this can be tough but do-able.  Say you was to paydown 3,000 principal in the first 2 years on a mortgage loan.  The additional payment might be 14,000 more with a fully amortizing principal and interest loan.  Taking  that 14,000 and properly investing it can yield several thousand more in the same 2 years than the 3,000 in equity.  Remember there is no return on equity until it is converted into cash.  The conversion cost via a refinance can eat up quite a chunk.  Also there is the risk of having to sell sooner than expected and no equity to cover resale costs.  It requires good financial discipline to use a neg am loan as a tool but when used properly they can be a useful thing.  The problem today is most loan reps lure people into them, but cannot teach the borrower how to make them work as a investment tool.|`|AA10352260	go to amortization calculator over here <br>  <a href="http://www.99acres.com/property/home_finance.php?link=HF_tab&city=" rel="nofollow">http://www.99acres.com/property/home_fin...</a><br>  <br>  you may find it usefull|`|ad4da64b567189d5b0587864ad3ab72caa	there is no way to use negitive amortization correctly.  its a bad bet.  however if you have to use negitive amortization do it only in investing purposes such as flipping a house for a profit.  that way you can have as little as possible go to a monthly mortgage while you flip a house and wait for it to sell.|`|b6bca96873c683bced92153884132f80aa	Good question.  Interest only loans that give you negative amortization, are used a lot by high net worth individuals.  They do not need the loan.  The interest is a tax tool to help with the fact that they are often in the 38%federal tax bracket (ouch).<br>  <br>  It was the history that few people used these types of loans.  However, recently they have become more common.  The second way you can use these loans is to cover a short term real estate cost.  For example the 20 percent down payment (from the house you are selling) to buy the house you are buying...but the first home is not sold just yet.  You can buy the new home with an interest only 20% loan and a conventional 80% loan.  Then, you get the low payments of the interest only 20% loan, and when you sell the first home you can pay that loan off.<br>  <br>  These are the two best ways to use these loans.  There are others but are highly risky.|`|AA11573642	The major purpose of negative amortization has been to reduce the mortgage payment at the beginning of the loan contract. It has been used for this purpose on both fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) and adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). A second purpose, applicable only to ARMs, has been to reduce the potential for payment shock -- a very large increase in the mortgage payment associated with an increase in the ARM interest rate.<br>  .|`|4b630af2206ab6496f2ef1fcfee51cf2aa	advoid it like the plague.

Only an experienced and professional financial planner should be helping you.  Maybe put 10% of your portfolio into Euro futures.  I believe you can also buy Euros and hold them in your investment portfolio just as you can buy gold or other commodities.<br>  <br>  The Euro is trading at $1.37 and could go as high as $3 if one chooses to believe a currency exchange trader.|`|943221480d21f2d87b3b295033288133aa	Heck, buy gold stock mutual funds.

xMqgB2GDaa	It's not the balance, it's the utilization. Having credit cards that you never use is bad, but not as bad as having credit cards that are maxed out all the time. You should try to maintain a credit utilization of around 30%, and pay it off every month; that is, if you have $1000 credit limit, you should charge roughly $300 to it every month, and pay it off EVERY MONTH. This is the best use of credit typically, and will result in the best bumps to your credit score. But there are many other factors that play into it. Also, you'll want to use the card with the longest history.|`|kPNnfjNSaa	It's best to carry a small balance for 6 months to a year, before paying it all off at once. This is because it will BUILD your credit rating. If you open a card and pay it off completely every month, your rating will not be positively (or negatively) affected.|`|XwXuJIF8aa	Teh experts say the best way to a high score is to have no balance, to keep it paid on time monthly.

PMRn7JgBaa	I'm fixing to graduate from a community college with an associate's degree in nursing.  Each college has different classes that you are required to take before joining the nursing program (called prerequisites).  There really is no difference between an associates in nursing and a bachelors in nursing ( at least not in texas).  The pay is the same and most of the time you can still have a management position with an associates.  What you can do is talk to a counselor at the college your interested in and see what classes they require.  For me it took about a year and a half to get my pre-req's and the actual program takes 2 years.  Once you graduate from the nursing program you have to take a state administered test called the NCLEX.  To be licensed you have to pass the NCLEX.<br>  <br>  Good luck, Hope all goes well with your school.<br>  Hang in their too, the program can sometimes be overwhelming and stressful, but you can make it!!|`|1cUcGgrJaa	You can call your community college and speak with a counselor in the nursing education department, they'll tell you all you need to know. <br>  <br>  A two year or associate's degree in nursing is known as a ADN. You do have to have a certain number of specific course requirements completed prior to even applying for the "clinical nursing" portion of the ADN program, specifically, Anatomy and Physiology, chem, English, sociology..... many of those courses can be accomplished while your'e in HS and will satisfy the college requirements. Go for it! Call the counselors and get as much done in HS as you can, it makes it much easier and faster to get to the next step of clinical nursing courses. Good luck!|`|WAQYCncPaa	Jefferson School of Nursing offers programs for young adults wanting to go straight from high school into college. The program is called FACT, you should check into it because you need no pre-reqs.Good Luck!

b22faa3abff5e7a246b2702086fea238aa	Great question!<br>  <br>  I have consulted with many companies that market and sell clothing and beauty products over the internet. Most of my clients will do their buying in Vegas or on the coasts. The issue that frustrates them has been keeping the inventory up to date on the site, because they have a physical location they also retail out of. <br>  <br>  If you do decide to go 100% e-commerce, then you will need to buy in lots that are big enough to supply demand. Your bounce rate will be horrible if every other item is out of stock. You also need to look at your ROI on your advertising and marketing as well. You will need to throw a good amount of money into SEO (search engine optimization) and PPC (pay per click). You need to do both because 50% look at the ads and 50% of the eyeballs look at the free organic listings. The flip side is that you will need a substantial marketing budget to get started.<br>  <br>  The SEO will run you around $3-$10k up front and then a maintenance fee monthly. The ad word campaign will run $800- $8000 and up monthly, depending on your targeted area and your target demographics.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped.<br>  <br>  <br>  "The Marketing Guy"<br>  www.lightscameraadvertise.com

NO|`|2N6oTOLQaa	The answer is probably not, but a very small maybe.<br>  <br>  They are not an energy upgrade, so no tax credits there. <br>  <br>  They could possibly be a tax deduction against capital gains taxes if you had to install the new gutters to sell the house because the old ones were damaged in some way. If this is the case, you could deduct the cost of the gutters from the amount of capital gains that you pay tax on. In order for this to count, it must be a repair done specifically to increase the sale price of the home, not something you did so that you could live in a house with better gutters.|`|AA10447831	They are not environmentally helpful so no, I think not.

Then start off slow using Google Adsense and place just one or two prominent ads.  Once your site gets regular traffic you can slowly place a few more advertisements.<br>  <br>  Learning SEO basics can help you build up your site traffic on your own.|`|zCFhBBCaaa	Another myth perpetrated by those who want to sell you ebooks and courses. Sure it's possible if you are experienced at SEO and promotion techniques, supply your website with constantly updated quality content people are looking for, but this is not nearly as simple as they want you to believe.|`|b22faa3abff5e7a246b2702086fea238aa	Advertisements can make you money if it falls inside your online  marketing plan strategy and goal. <br>  <br>  You have to consider what happens when someone clicks on an ad. They leave your website. You have lost a set of eyeballs away from your website to another website. Instead of staying on your site, the person is now surfing farther away. <br>  <br>  If you aren't getting a heavy volume of hits, you need to capture and keep any eyeballs that make it to your site. If you are working hard to produce hits from SEO or PPC efforts, you have to think about how much time, MONEY, effort and work you had to invest to get that hit. Once you realize what it takes on your part to get a hit, then weigh that to the penny or two that you will make from Google adsence or any other affiliate. There is a reason why adsence costs less to the google customer then paying for Adword traffic. The reason is that a more qualified searcher will come from Adwords because they directly typed into Google what they were looking for. Adsence kind of is an impulse type click and produces more "browsers" instead of "buyers". <br>  <br>  Wouldn't it make more sence to keep the eyes on your product or service so you can make a sale? <br>  <br>  One the other hand, if you are not trying to sell a product or service on your site, then placing ads on your site may make sence. The "free" websites that are for a cause or genuine reason are the sites that get most traffic. Think about Google before Adwords or Yahoo before PPC. They were and STILL are the top traffic sites on the internet. They didn't start out making ANY money and they have stayed FREE to the user. They eventualy found a wonderful revenue source by placing paid ads on their sites. <br>  <br>  There are many sites online that are designed for the benefit of the user. They end up getting a lot of traffic and have an opportunity to follow the Google Adsence model. It just makes sence for these kind of websites.<br>  <br>  Here's a great example of a free site that uses Google adsence correctly: <br>  <br>  www.arearides.com<br>  <br>  <br>  I kind of look at it like having a real brick and mortor store that you spend time and money on advertising (radio, TV, newpaper, yellowpages Etc) to get business to your storefront. You start getting traffic at the front door BUT you never see 10%- 15% or MORE of your ready to buy customers because you allow a sales rep from another company to greet EVERY patron upon entering. They get first wack at stealing your potential customers money instead of coming into your store to see what you have to offer! This just doesn't make sence! <br>  <br>  Also, I have seen MANY websites (usually sub-domain cookie cutter sites) that look like something off of the strip in Los Vegas. There too  many flashing lights and bells. I always have bad feelings with these kin of sites because there are so many websites like these that rip people off.<br>  <br>  To get started, I would suggest Google Adsence. You can also find zillions of afilliate programs by typing "affiliate advertising" into any search engine. Just look around for a network of affiliates within your industry that would make sence. You don't want to send eyeballs to your direct competition, but find other businesses that would offer synergy. For example: if you sold tires, you could network with someone that sold transmissions or someone that offered painting servoices for a vehicle.<br>  <br>  I hope this has helped you and I wish you success!<br>  <br>  "The Guru Marketing Guy"<br>  <br>  www.Lightscameraadvertise.com

VkpQJ0LSaa	First, in order to find out a program that is suitable for your situation, you can weight the pros and cons and different programs and options out there.<br>  <br>  By doing consolidation you pay the consolidation company on a monthly basis a set amount of money, that is then distributed among your creditors as a monthly payment and you do commit to keep current on your accounts. Even though interest can be reduced you are still liable to pay the full amount of your debt, so the time frame to eliminate your debt through consolidation can be of 5 - 7 years depending on your funds of course. Since it is such a long process, many lenders do look at it as chapter 13 bankruptcy.<br>  <br>  Another option out there that offers significant advantages and can help you eliminate debt faster than most other programs is Debt Settlement. Through Debt Settlement a company negotiates on your behalf with your creditors, in order for you to pay them back a much lower percentage of the overall debt once the settlement has been reached, of course the success of the program depends on your ability to set aside some funds.

QVExMJ5oaa	lasginny,<br>  <br>  wow, that's a wide open question. Unfortunately, your profile doesn't tell much about you, and it'd be really helpful to know what you're good at.<br>  <br>  But here are just a few ideas.<br>  1) If you think you're good at business or computers or figuring out processes, think about consulting. People who work for consultants get on contracts for companies at leats throughout the country (sometimes worldwide), so you can always be going to a new city for a project. (I can tell you more about consulting if you're interested.)<br>  <br>  2) Journalism, either in print or TV/Radio. Then, you're going to wherever the story is. How's you're writing? How are you in front of a camera (speaking skills)? How are you behind a camera (as the photographer)? Any of those skills would help in journalism.<br>  <br>  3) Do you like archeology? That'll get you all around the world.<br>  <br>  4) Cross-cultural studies, which is kind of under the Diversity umbrella. That means you're dealing with other cultures. It also means that you're may be doing consulting with companies that are looking for your expertise.<br>  <br>  5) Lots of schools now offer degrees in International business. This kind of goes closely with cross-cultural studies, but there's lots of jobs that in companies that haev to deal with suppliers and partners and customers worldwide. It may even be that the company has its own divisions in other countries. So those positions can find themselves travelling (sometimes more often than they'd like) between the different sites. For instance, I do some training on cross-cultural negotiations. If a company needs to work out something with people in another culture, it's valuable to have someone along who understands how they think, what they value, ...<br>  <br>  6) Sales. No, not like a salesperson at a store, but a corporate salesperson that sells to other companies. That means you'll be going to trade shows, meeting lots of people, doing tons of travel. And if you're good at that, you're getting commissions on what you sell and can be extremely lucrative.<br>  <br>  There's so many other things, but I'm just guessing because I don't know what you like to do and what you're good at. I hope I've at least shown you that you've got lots of choices; your first question should be about the things you want to do, then start looking for jobs/places to apply it.|`|KJ7CoP7zaa	Have you thought about becoming your own boss?

QVExMJ5oaa	I understand your question -- you aren't looking for a shipper, you're looking for a supplier.<br>  <br>  I used to do the same thing, selling Acer computers as a wholesaler and using a dropshipper to supply and deliver them. <br>  <br>  At the time, I used Microopen (in Lawrence, KS) and found them to be very reliable and inexpensive. They're still in business at www.microtechkansas.com and provide built-to-order systems. So check them out. If you don't want to use them, you'll want to get a copy of the Computer Resellers News, and that's where vendors advertise for distributors. That's where I found Microopen, originally, and that's also where I found my CD supplier (back when I sold CD-ROMs).<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|5zQbG8TDaa	Try Ups or Fed Ex.

xUTBxM2aaa	While you are on the computer, do your homework on the colleges you live next to.  If you are lucky enough to live next to a college that will offer you a Bachelor's, that is good.  Look at the majors.  Do some soul searching.  What are you good at?  What do you enjoy?  Don't think only about money, because that won't work.  If you still don't know, when you go to school, just do your required classes first and then by then you might have an idea of what you want to do.  I would take a loan out, not a government loan though, but a bank loan.  Take day classes and work the night shift, good thing about grocery stores is their flexibility in hours.  Once you have your degree, the loan will then need to be paid.  Hopefully by then you will have had an internship in your job, and experience, and you can get a career started and you can pay off that loan.  <br>  <br>  Another option is to get into something technical, like getting a certificate in something, like a nurse's aid, or a pharmacy tech.  This will take some education, but it's only for a few months, and you will be able to get a higher paying job.<br>  <br>  It sucks that you don't have family, I suggest you visit your nearest college and ask to speak with a counselor.  Even if you are not attending their college, maybe they can help you with your options.<br>  <br>  This is a long process, and if you are a very motivated person, you can do this.  Just plan ahead, and do what makes you happy.  I hope the best for you.|`|ee14e206dbb372dcb6ac973cd2828e69aa	Two answers for you:<br>  <br>  1. Learn to do your job very well. Take an interest in all facets of your store and your company. Your employers will notice and promotion will follow. An acquaintance of mine started bagging at a chain supermarket (Winn Dixie) and now two years later he is the assistant manager.<br>  <br>  2. Continue your education. You can learn as much as you like without having to quit your job to go to school. You can increase your knowledge and/or improve your skills through community colleges, employment training programs and even online learning. Also ask your supervisor. Some employers have training programs or are willing to assist you to get the education you need. You can do most of this at little or no cost. As your training becomes more marketable, you will be able to invest more in advancing yourself.<br>  <br>  One last piece of advice. Find out what you enjoy doing and then see what opportunities there are getting paid to do them. "The man who does what he loves never works a day in his life." - Anonymous|`|d4d8b0e9f71b32c77408aa80c7ac9464aa	you need to go to college if you want a good career! or you can stay where you are and move up in the ranks and make that your career|`|6GuWw1DPaa	be all you can be|`|paIUgtLRaa	I really like the answer from AnswerMe.<br>  <br>  Being 19 and not knowing is tough. Being without family is tough and it does suck.<br>  First and foremost, your immediate financial situation. Is there a loved one (boyfriend/girlfriend), a friend, a coworker, that you can live with or have them move them in with you? Bringing someone else in can reduce expenses by dividing some of the bills. Some of the bills like food and utilities will go up with the increased usage, but having to pay only half the bill will do wonders for the pocketbook. <br>  Next is deciding what you want to do. In high school, was there any particular subjects you liked. Do you like numbers? Do you like people? Did you like science at all? English class? Reason is that depending on your favorite subjects, a career following those lines might be possible. If you like numbers and math, perhaps something accounting oriented might be something. Talk to employment agencies, local goverment offices dealing with help in employment, local school counselors (like college or university, or tradeschool, yeah they charge for the education, but talking to them might help identify an interest in which career direction), or anyone that I can't think of currently. AnswerMe is right, money isn't everything. Even the highest paying jobs aren't worth it if you don't like the job. <br>  I might have the solution, even though you could possibly be across the country. (There's no Kroger where I am at)<br>  <br>  The line about tired of living this way really spoke to me. Even though you could possibly be across the country, I might have a solution. If you like helping others and you are interested in making money part-time while working at the grocery store. Let me know. Email me. 
WoRaXE73aa	All of those involving helping people in some degree. What you may examine is what each one goes with: do you like medicine, or helping little kids? I think when you start to discern what type of helping you like to do it might be easier to sort it out.

XvMPdzjUaa	Any degree, certificate or qualification will help you find a better job, even if it's not a "relevant" qualification. They demonstrate an ability to learn, commitment and level of intelligence. While a relevant qualification is always preferable, in both banking, and office jobs, you are probably going to be going up against unqualified people, so even your old business clerical certificate will put you ahead.<br>  <br>  One problem you will face is being branded a "flake". You need to be very clear that you were not sure what you wanted to do when you started to do your previous training, you were never sure what you wanted to do with it, but are now committed to this new path. Even if it isn't true, tell them this is absolutely what you want to do for the rest of your career, and you are now sure about your future. <br>  <br>  Sell yourself on your strengths, which include your ability to excel and achieve as demonstrated by your past qualifications, and express an interest in getting relevant qualifications on the job, if that is something that they would like you to pursue.|`|FATyhyZ2aa	Any job, hobby, club, life experience can be applied toward a new job if you can state how any aspect of it correlates to the new job. / I related 5 months of bar-tending to being a crisis advocate at an abuse shelter.

a40b7bc31034b7f8736eedca3cf243b2aa	Offizielle Daten gibt es leider darüber nicht. Auf jeden Fall war Deutschland nach Amerika und Ru?land jahrelang auf Platz Nummer 3 der Waffenexporteure. War doch bereits vor und nach den beiden Weltkriegen so. Mit deutschen von Krupp hergestellten Kanonen wurde auf deutsche Soldaten geschossen, welche mit Krupp Kanonen zurückschossen. Da gilt immer noch der alte Spuch: Deutsche Waffen, deutsches Geld, morden mit in aller Welt. Nach der jahrzehntelangen Teilung Deutschlands und einer mühsamen Wiedervereinigung, sind auch mal wieder deutsche Soldaten im Ausland zu finden. Natürlich auf "Friedensmissionen". Das Wort kommt mir so ?de und fade vor, wie das von Bush, Kampf gegen den Terror. Wenn ich mein Studium fertig habe, werd ich mein Glück mal in anderen L?ndern versuchen.

If you have Microsoft Word there are several resume templates that they have, you just look through the templates and choose one. That's what I did. So go to Microsoft Word and then go to File, then New and it should be under that option. Then look through the templates and just choose one.<br>  <br>  When it brings it up, you just have to fill in the blanks. Make sure you get rid of the brackets and blank spaces. I'm going to give you a link for resume samples and how resumes should look like.

xwPI2e9raa	When it comes to credit card processing there are 2 way to go about this. The first is through pay-pal or a like company.These are what we call in the industry 3rd party payment processors. These types of companies are good only if you are a small company, usually from home and if you are doing under a $1000.00 a month. The pros to this can of account is that it is an easy setup and simple to use. The cons are that it is web based, you as the business owner have no real protection against chargebacks(when a customer dispute a charge) pay-pal is always going to be on the customers side and not yours. Also it takes 4-5 days to receive your money. The 2nd options is opening a merchant account. This is meant for business owners that are doing over $1000 a month. These types of account is for retail locations, over the phone orders and ecommerce.  This system is very fast, run a card and within seconds the customer is either approved or decline and then on to the next one. The pros are that you are protected against chargebacks, you receive your money in1-2 days and you have complete control over you account. The cons are it may cost a little more upfront for equipment but most companies can offer inexpensive equipment or possible free. As far as credit score go, merchant services companies are just like any other finance company. Some have very strict policies and some not so strict. Working in the merchant services industry myself I know certain companies that won't touch anything under a 650. On the other hand I know of companies that have a min required score of 500. The nice thing about this is that unlike a finance company which will charge you more because of poor credit, merchant services companies do not. It is either you are approved or not, but you still receive the same price(% rate) regardless of credit score. The last thing is, it also depends on what type of business you have (restaurant, gas station, hair salon, etc) certain companies have an automatic approval policy based simple on the business type. Which means if you business type falls into certain "preferred business type" you will be automatically approved regardless of credit. In the industry we know certain types of companies work better and have less issues than other. To give you an example, if you are a restaurant and go into a bank and try to get a loan, 9-10 banks won't even look at you. However in the merchant services industry if you want an account you will be approved 99.9 out of a 100 times. A merchant services account is just an open line of credit, just like a loan. If i had a little more info I would be able to give you exact details. Hope that this helped. If you need any more info don't hesitate to ask.|`|zpwJR60baa	Make sure, you read the fine print on the Credit card fraud and insurance reimbursement. <br>  I had used pay-pal to pay for 2 services in the past.  They are not good in contacting merchant on getting your money back. The seller have to do it themselves.  However they are secured.  You can always charged the percent fee when client use credit card.<br>  <br>  Some small business, will not accept credit card under $10.00, so maybe you can do this policy.|`|CUxQKMXaaa	May be this site can help you<br>  www.finance.a1onlineeducation.com
Daq9gituaa	In theory and as defined by the IRS you have a capital gain that should be reported on your return. While you might could get by without reporting the sale, note that your bank is required to report any banking transaction involving amounts of 10K or more. Here is an excerpt from the IRS publication 544:<br>  <br>  Sales and Exchanges <br>  A sale is a transfer of property for money or a mortgage, note, or other promise to pay money.<br>  <br>  Gain or Loss From Sales and Exchanges<br>  Gain or loss is usually realized when property is sold or exchanged. A gain is the amount you realize from a sale or exchange of property that is more than its adjusted basis. A loss is the adjusted basis of the property that is more than the amount you realize.  <br>  <br>  It might be best to contact the IRS (800-829-1040) for a ruling just to be sure.|`|RngUbYHfaa	You're supposed to.

When you sell an antique it is classified as a collectible and the capital gain income tax rate is 28%. However this year there is a special clause in figuring capital gains you are not taxed above your % rate for your income level. See IRS Pub 17 pages 112-116 for info about capital gains and then look at page 271 for your income tax rate schedule. <br>  <br>  You may be required to provide appraisals, pictures etc. Is the vase or similar vase shown in any publication? What was the value of the vase when your grandmother gave it to you (it's basis)?<br>  <br>  This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.

They make claims like it has 4 carats of diamonds in it but trust me it isn't the same as a 4 carat diamond...it just has 4 carats in weight of diamond chips that aren't worth diddly squat. It is a marketing tool they use now. As I said if you like the piece buy it but don't think it is worth anything more than the pretty factor. Ask them for an official valuation. I bet they wont give you one. And the key word there is official. If you want to invest in gold buy gold ingots. The price always goes up and you can cash them in whenever you wish and you can buy one now and then as you save the money.
l9Xg8Dv4aa	Sweetie, this means "how well do you get things done?'<br>  The underlying question here is" Will others want to follow you?"|`|kMyZEEhNaa	Never heard of it. Sounds like the HR  division of the company your are trying to get into makes up their own vocabulary.|`|gUxHXhjTaa	It means what can you personally do? or have to offer. What is a strong point or capability you have.

8WbfmK5daa	Unforunately I don't think you do.<br>  <br>  My bf was in the same situation he made his new employer aware that he had a previous convinction of driving with an out of date MOT. They let him start the job then when his disclosure came back with the conviction on it 4 weeks later they retracted the offer of employment and this was just a job working in sales but you had to go into people's home.<br>  <br>  However, saying that you do not actually have a convinction however they do have the right to retract the offer of employment for anything that shows on your disclosure that may pose as a threat to the people you will be working with whether it is a criminal convinction or a pending court case.<br>  <br>  Although most company's or places will not even offer you the job never mind put you through a disclosure if you have pending court cases and convinctions some still do.<br>  <br>  They have to be stricter on these things now a days since all the scandals with the people who have slipped through the net or who were still offered a job and subsequently used the postion to harm others.<br>  <br>  An employer, in some circumstances, can retract the offer of employment within the first 3 months for any reason the means you are no longer suitable for the job.<br>  <br>  However, you don't need to take my word for it lol.<br>  <br>  No seriously if you think you were wrong done by take it further and just see's what happens the worst they can say is they were within there rights.|`|GwQevn2Gaa	No if you are a ex-thief you present too much of a risk to employ.|`|oVhKGw3Maa	I am going to give you the correct answer, not a load of fluff, or tell you what a bum deal you are getting.<br>   The council are quite within their rights to withdraw their offer of employment. You do not have any redress for that action.<br>  All that remains for you is to have your day in court, if you are found innocent of the charges, that would be better than not guilty, then re-apply for the post. If they refuse to accept your application and if you are well qualified for the job, then you may, and I emphasise may, have a chance at discrimination, but do not hold your breath on that one.|`|wLUaZAt4aa	It is law article related site.

ujAzSfCzaa	The graduate should be anxious to enter the work force and contribute to the organization.  When I was young I was taught to thank my employer every day for my job.  Many young graduates expect the employers to than them every day, which I do, but they should be grateful for the job.<br>  <br>  The graduate should have enough common sense to realize that the degree is the beginning of the training, not the end.  The person should be willing to learn from any employee that is assigned as a mentor.  <br>  <br>  I don't expect the graduate to know much about my day to day operations, because every company is different.  If I assign him to shadow a low level clerk for a week, the graduate should learn from the experience and not feel it is his/her job to help my trusted employee become better.<br>  <br>  Of course I also expect the graduate to have a working knowledge of the many courses he/she has completed.

Routine exposure to RF radiation has not been shown to be a health risk.|`|F66hnqlIaa	Not much if any. If you file the claim your doctor will have to link RF to your exposure. Once that's done and if the doctor thinks you have RF exposure than the insurance company will send you to a independent medical exam. <br>  <br>  It's likely that the claim would be denied.

60cwSqE9aa	As Flup says, there is very little genuine work of this type. Furthermore, the ones seeking a start-up fee are illegal pyramid schemes at best and a simple scam most of the time. Never reply to these advertisements. <br>  <br>  As far as work from home is concerned, one thing that requires little skill for which there's always demand is an ironing service. All you need is an ironing board and an iron. A car to deliver and collect is useful and will increase trade but will add heavily to costs as you'll have to have Class 1 insurance (business use). Most people who do an ironing service charge piece rates, i.e. so much for a shirt, so much for a sheet, etc. You could try charging per hour but this may confuse customers.|`|QydVDaXRaa	There's very little genuine work of this type available any more.

74530f1c293522b59e9e263928bd2299aa	I used to live in upstate NY, had a few farmer friends.   As a child I always wanted to live on a farm.   But after meeting many farmers, farming has to be in the heart.  Farming is a lot of hard work.  There are no incentives other than that there is peace and comfort that is what you what.  There are government loans.. or accounts.. not sure how they work, but I do know that farming is not something you go for if you wanna get rich.  It is a 'I want to do this".. kind of like teachers.  Ya gotta do it for the right reasons... As long as farming is in your heart.. all will be ok.The farmers I knew, were handed down to them.  And they chose to keep it.   Now I might be wrong, the only farmers I know are dairy farmers.  Not big corp farmers... family farms... Very happy people, but hard workers.  So you have to decide do you wanna be a happy farmer or a tired man trying to get rich?|`|c858e35fce0968c95fa522cea2bf7b2daa	If you are looking for handouts,  its the wrong thing to get into.  hard work is what it takes!
AA10144492	Since any names that are suggested here may already be owned by another party, I wanted to go a different route...<br>  <br>  Here's a few things to keep in mind:<br>  <br>  1) Keep your industry, your clients/customers, your advertising plan in mind. <br>  <br>  2) The more unique & distinctive a name, the higher the chances that the name is legally available for use. And the higher the chances of obtaining the trademark.<br>  <br>  3) Think of your business as having a personality. What kind of image do you want your business to portray? <br>  <br>  Specific brainstorming tips:<br>  <br>  Think about what you want but more importantly, think about what you DON'T want. If you don't want a 3-word name, don't bother with those. If you don't want non-English words, don't bother with those & so on and so forth.<br>  <br>  What are the "types" of names you like? Think about words in their simple forms, e.g. adjectives, Latin roots, mythological names, etc. Compile a listing of the types & then seek out resources, such as books or sites, which specialize in those types.<br>  <br>  Here are some links where you can do some preliminary name checking:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=tess&state=tbmkb6.1.1" rel="nofollow">http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=te...</a>  -- USPTO – Preliminary Search of Federal trademarks<br>  <a href="http://biztaxlaw.about.com/od/research/a/Sec_of_state.htm" rel="nofollow">http://biztaxlaw.about.com/od/research/a...</a> --Go to your state's Secretary of State page to see if they have a searchable database of business names<br>  <a href="http://www.hoovers.com/free/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hoovers.com/free/</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.thomasnet.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.thomasnet.com</a> – Must register (free) to search their database<br>  <br>  However, please be aware that this is merely scratching the surface of what's out there. <br>  <br>  Only comprehensive research will tell you if the name is truly available. But, these links are free & a great place to start, so I'd try them out first. This entails searching the pending & registered Federal and State trademark files as well as the US National Common-Law files. Then, if clear, you can decide if you would like to file for a Federal or a State trademark. <br>  <br>  There are other sites that offer free searching capabilities in conjunction with their commercial services, so I'm not able to post those links due to the Yahoo! TOS. You'll also want to check domain names & yellow pages, so simply do a search for "free domain name search" and "national yellowpages" and the appropriate links will pop up.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps! I wish you much success & happiness in all your ventures!|`|EzY9rcWBaa	This is a great article about - How to Select a Company or Product Name - <a href="http://www.developer-resource.com/how-to-select-a-company-name.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.developer-resource.com/how-to...</a><br>  <br>  The article has some good advice on how to research names, and what to becareful of. <br>  <br>  Should get you started!<br>  Best of luck|`|8gv5e8cvaa	Perl Wood|`|IGJLSvGAaa	needle wood

C3LiKhm8aa	There are some legal and reasonable things you can use on your resume.  Do not falsify anything.  If you didn't graduate college, do not say you did.  If you have certification as anything, put that in, but don't claim something you don' t have.<br>  <br>  If you lie on your resume or inflate your experience, the new employer will discover this when you can't do the new job as well as your padded resume says you should be able to.  This will lead to a very difficult series of meetings and probably firing.  People reading resumes have a very good idea of the experience and training a person of a specific age will have and anything too far out of line raises a red flag.  If you are 22 years old and your resume says you invented the internet, your resume will hit the garbage can in record time.  There are exceptions to this, but they are few and far between and are usually backed up by a lot of other internal evidence in the resume and, sometimes, in the public record; Google searches can reveal a lot.<br>  <br>  However, there are many people who don't use the chronological timeline for a resume, but rather state their experience in terms of what they can do and have done, leaving the actual company names and dates off the resume.  You can find examples of this in resume guide books.  This is especially useful if you have worked as a consultant.<br>  <br>  The reference would be as follows.<br>  <br>  Major Insurance Company.  Developed financial controls and solutions for risk management in hangnail insurance underwriting.  Reduced exposure by 20% and enhanced profits by 15%.  The project required blah blah blah and we used blah blah software.<br>  <br>  If you do use the chronological format, you can make the dates years, not year and month.  Instead of saying you worked at Jones and Co from August 2002 to November 2004, you could say 2002 to 2004.   This is usually acceptable.<br>  <br>  You can also add a section on your experience as a skill set, delineating all the different tasks you've performed or projects you've worked on and the effect on the company's bottom line.<br>  <br>  You can add a section on the software or hardware you've used and what you've done with it.<br>  <br>  Because of fears of lawsuits, most companies won't give out more than the dates of employment and a very general description of the terms of separation.  But don't count on this, as there is always the chance that the two people working in the different companies are friends.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that you should present yourself in the best possible light but you should be honest.  There is nothing wrong with using a different resume model; just be sure it is honest and that it presents you accurately.   I've read thousand of resumes and most of them are dull as dirt; a resume that has all the information about a candidate but resents it in an interesting, concise format grabs my attention and sometimes gives that person an edge.|`|XGsuxRR2aa	If you stretch dates, that is lying. True, if they find out it's not correct, they're likely not to hire you...<br>  <br>  However... any false information on a resume (an inaccurate date) can be grounds for immediate termination...<br>  <br>  So if they really wanted to, they could keep you working, and if you were going to work there until you retire... the day before you retire... fire you for that reason, you'd be out of luck.|`|BhXwQ2n1aa	no, I it's not illegal but why would you do that. almost every place that requires a resume is going to check the information on that resume. you're just begging not to get the job|`|qxMpbNRBaa	Short but sweet no you cant get in any legal trouble but if your worried about short job periods most professionals suggest leaving out dates and reason for leaving anyhow it is better to clarify these in person|`|AA10469473	You wouldn't be in legal trouble, but wouldn't get the job.

The moment I see inconsistency or catch someone in a lie during an interview, that person has 0 chance at me giving them a job.<br>  <br>  It shows poor business ethics, no confidence, and a lack of morals.  Desperation is never attractive.<br>  <br>  Go with the truth and re-think how you can be honest in showing your good qualities.  They are there, I'm sure.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck.<br>  <br>  I don't know the legal implications, but you run a big risk in "embellishment".  Don't do it.|`|AA10041941	I don't know sounds risky to me.. I'd just say with this honesty is the best policy.. its more than just your resume that gets you in the door..remember you have to put contact numbers on there and believe it or not they DO call so if you lie, and the other employers tell them differently they will see you aren't very trustworthy and move on to someone else with maybe not better experience but more moral standards. Yeah, your right though they won't hire you thats probably the worst that can happen though because seriously in this economy ANY job isn't worth risking! No matter how you put it any embellishment IS a lie..|`|ilbMPWmzaa	yeah, legally there's nothing wrong with that. but if you are interested in that job, i really think you shouldn't lie on your resume. many respectable companies do background checks and call your references (if you have any). what do u mean add some language?|`|T8f8C3Tfaa	You cannot get into legal trouble but you can get fired for lying on your resume/application.
4ooXYuYFaa	A dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future. There is a "time value" associated with money. SO, when looking at a company's cash flows, it is important to consider that the earnings in the future will technically be less than if they were earned today. Given a stated rate of inflation, in order to realize the true value of earnings, it is important to understand the difference of what money is worth today versus in the future. <br>  <br>  Accordingly, money today is compounded to show what it will be worth in the future whereas future cash flows are discounted to show what they would be worth today.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps - it is a very important concept - and one that all other finance courses (and real life) will draw upon.|`|8juUgSK2aa	it isn't really that important.|`|jmlAmr3gaa	Why is it important to know how much money you'll have at the end of the week, when you want to go out with friends?|`|gUxHXhjTaa	It has many meanings ex: You buy a car.

For example, where I'm from we have the "Thrifty Nickel" flyer/newspaper. <br>       You can put ads on Craigslist under the "for sale" items for no charge. They might delete it, might not. <br>       Newspaper advertising is great, but gets expensive for large ads in big news companies.|`|e27fe1a9205b53137b4cbd03b8a47947aa	Advertise in newspapers and put up flyers in local stores and surrounding towns.|`|v3n9LA2Haa	spray paint the neighbourhood dog with your logo
OacSIfSiaa	In accordance with Running of Reporting Period - Section 605 [15 U.S.C. § 1681c] of the FC RA, this judgment will remain on your report for more then just 7 years!  The time period is determined  by which is the longest, your state statutes or the FCRA.  Most states will keep a judgment listed for 10 years and it can be renewed, so in essence this could remain on your report for 20 yrs.<br>  <br>  They can seek a writ of garnishment and garnish your wages (the amount is also determined by state statutes) or many follow federal guidelines which is 25% of net income.  North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Pennsylvania do not allow garnishment of ones wages.<br>  <br>  In some states they can seize accounts or even owned property to be sold to pay the debt.<br>  <br>  As to getting a mortgage, the judgment has to be paid off first as the creditor could place a lien on the house.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps answer your question.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to find what your state statutes are<br>  <a href="http://www.bcsalliance.com/statute_of_limitations_on_debt.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bcsalliance.com/statute_of_li...</a>|`|LiGWTLpSaa	They can garnish your wages or garnish your bank account.<br>  <br>  They also have 7 years to collect - so time is on their side.|`|IKakoOfyaa	It will definitely lower your credit score however, there is a time limit as to how long it can legally appear on your report (7 years, I think).<br>  <br>  With the credit crunch, your credit score has to be excellent in order to qualify for a home loan so it may be a moot point, at least until the economy straightens out and credit criteria is loosened.|`|AA11727490	NO home until the judgment falls off your credit score (7 yrs) or you pay it. Judgments can also go after your 'payroll'. In otherwords, the court can garnish your wages automatically to pay off the judgment. You should get ahold of the company that put the judgment on you, and ask if you can give them 20.00 per month even. And stick to the arrangements you make with them. They are more likely with the economy the way it is to work something out with you, than to take the loss altogether. Try and work with them, you maybe surprised at what they will offer to accept. Start with a low amount , like 10.00 a month and work it up to 20.00 if they will accept it. Good Luck|`|gUxHXhjTaa	A judgment means someone to you to court and one.

When many houses are foreclosed upon (based on whatever event, in this case, the bursting of the housing bubble and the increase in unemployment, among other things) it will cause all house prices to lower.<br>  <br>  You're correct, a house's value has nothing to do with whether its owner has the ability to pay the mortgage.  However, if many people in the same area are all being foreclosed upon, this leads to a skyrocket in supply, with the same or less demand.  In this case, with the all the unemployment that's going around, there is also less demand.<br>  <br>  Since the banks are losing money by having lots of foreclosed properties that they have to pay taxes on and maintain, they would rather sell those properties at lower prices to get rid of them faster, while still maintaining some ability to recoup losses.  Comparable homes in the same area will see that their values fall because there is a ready supply of houses available with the same features for a lower price.<br>  <br>  Also, all these people defaulting and being foreclosed upon, as discussed earlier, is a bad thing for the bank.  They have realized this, and now have tightened up on policies for mortgage lending.  The pool of buyers has decreased greatly based on ability to save down payment and their reliability in the past (credit score).<br>  <br>  So yeah... more houses for sale + fewer buyers.  This is a textbook example of supply and demand.

qBCGH52haa	If your place of business is open to the public (i.e., the server is not trespassing), under most laws you can be served at work.  While calling you at work is not initially against the law, if the collectorknows that your employer, as a matter of course, does not allow these types of calls to be made to you at work, then they must cease calling you at work.  Also, if you notify the debt collector in writing that you want all phone calls to stop, they must abide by your wishes and cease calling you.  I would advise sending the collection agency a certified, return receipt requested letter requesting that they stop trying to contact you to collect the debt and that you will initiate any further contact between yourself and the agency.  (One thing of note, for $32,000, they may take this as a sign you are unwilling to pay and may start court proceedings against you.)<br>  <br>  For more info on your rights, see this publication:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre27.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer...</a>|`|AT8L5w95aa	They are bound by law not to call you at work.<br>  <br>  You should do one of two things.

AA12065007	Having been through this myself I can tell you to look for a drop of between 100-150 points at first.<br>  <br>  But you can and should reestablish your credit as soon as your BK discharges, I used 3 credit cards First Premier, Orchard Bank and H.S.B.C. for every day things and paid them off in full before the due date and in 12-months my score had gone up 150-points in 24 it raised another 100.<br>  <br>  I bought a new car after only 12-months with no money down and got a 3.9% interest rate after 12-months of paying on that I bought a new home again with no money down and got a 6.5% fixed rate.<br>  <br>  It takes time and hard work but it can be done, and just so you will know bankruptcy's show for 10-years not 7.|`|rnfxNYx3aa	IF you included all these accounts in the BK and if you are diligent in making sure the accounts are recorded as a BK then you will be absolutely shocked at how quickly it could go up. Within 1 year a friend's went from 580 to over 700 points.  Typical, probably not but it depends on your having something you continue to pay on and doing it without fail for the next 6 months to a year.<br>  <br>  Notice I did not say without penalty such as outrageous interest rates but the score rebounds rapidly given the right conditions like the account or a home being paid on.|`|ef652b889fbb589b6a5a57ae7d6d8afcaa	Yep.  It sounds like the whole was dug a long time ago but it was a big hole never the less.  The charge offs and judgments hurt you, but the bankruptcy lasts for 7 years on your report.  That will keep your credit FICO score depressed at that level (high risk) for a long time.  You can make in-roads on it if you have no further judgements etc.  Probably within a couple of years of absolute clean stuff, you can get a loan for something, even earlier perhaps.  Places like CarMax and others will help you get a loan if you have had credit problems although the costs will be higher, as will the rate.  Best you can do is try and save your money so you can make a downpayment on something to reduce your term.  If you can get a re-start through something like that then you will start to see some improvement.  You're goal should be to live however you need to so you can keep things clean.  That means sacrifice and difficulty but, regardless of what you hear, there's no magic fix.  If you have done that for three years, have one or two of those loans that you can pay off, and then qualify for a higher interest credit card, paying off the balance EVERY month, you'll get your FICO probably north of 600.  Do it for five years, and you'll probably be able to get reasonable credit opportunities.  Do it for 7 and you'll find yourself over 700.<br>  <br>  Hard, I know.  Tough, for sure.  Painful... no question.  But if you can see ahead, it will improve your life.  I promise.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

Look at what comes up, how many results there are on Google, and other factors like that.  It's more than just a keyword search; there are a lot more factors to consider.  Also, you might want to start out with a bit more popular of an item, and then narrow that down.  Acai berry isn't the first thing that pops into my mind when I think of searches.

The will send you out a paper check to replace it, but that takes time.

ECEGpNVGaa	Firstly: forgive me for not giving many sources but I haven't the time. The details should be verifiable.<br>  <br>  Here goes: The BoE, like many big banks, is in fact a private corporation. <br>  <br>  If you read the BoE Act of 1946, which ostensibly nationalised the bank, you'll see that share ownership still remained with whoever held shares in it previously, now with a government guarantee, neat. Yes, the government makes board appointments, but the process is not transparent and easily lobbied.     <br>  <br>  The reason the bank is so closely tied to the government (more explicitely, HM Treasury)  shows how tightly interwoven parliament, The Crown and the BoE are. This has historical reasons, the BoE is the oldest institution of its kind and The Crown has had close relations to it and other corporations (British East India Company et al.) for hundreds of years. Empire as extension of corporate activity. <br>  <br>  The Federal Reserve Bank in the US is a private corporation, as well. Since it is historically quite young, though, it is easier to verify its status visa-vis the government, check the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. The Federal Reserve is owned by a number of large banks and private interests through shareholdings.<br>  <br>  Woodrow Wilson regretted his role in creating the Federal Reserve and its long-term consequences for the American people. <br>  <br>  In essence: The Federal Reserve and its precursor, the BoE are privately owned, for-profit institutions. The missing 75% of your calculation are filling the establishment's pockets. Whose in particular? That's harder to figure in the UK, when you find out, let me know.<br>  <br>  However, even the 25% going into HM treasury are not necessarily going towards revenue spent for public purposes. They are "the cut" The Crown gets for letting the BoE operate. A convenient arrangement.<br>  <br>  So much for the profits. How does the BoE create these profits, though? Mostly by the monopoly of lending money to the government and charging interest. That interest is paid back, amongst others, by the taxes that you pay. As you can see, you are not necessarily benefitting from the process. It might be worth while finding out to see how the 25% cut is spent.<br>  <br>  I am not sure if you are aware that governments, specifically their treasuries, can theoretically issue (and have practically issued) their own currency - and therefore wouldn't need to incur interest and, as a consequence, public debt. The process of creating money is the same for government as it is for the banks, by fiat ("out of thin air").<br>  <br>  The "innovation" that was the BoE, was to be made MONOPOLY lender to the government, and in the process set a bad example for other countries to follow.<br>  <br>  The BoE, the Parliament and The Crown are all located in the central part of London referred to as "The City of London". The City of London is itself a private corporation (issuing annual reports). It would be interesting to see how the BoE and The Crown interlink with that entity and the legal implications thereof.|`|SIwgYOSMaa	they need to do way instain banker> who kill their monnies.  becuse these monnies cant frigth back?<br>  <br>  It was on the news this mroing a bannker in TX, who had kill her three hdege fund.

FHA will also help out with your down payment.  Call a realtor|`|AA11173563	yes it is as many states have grant money available for down payments. BUT if you are not in a position financially then do not become the next foreclosure in the neighborhood. Get set before you buy with your down payments and closing cost and emergency funds of not less than 6 months total living expenses in an account that you do not touch until needed then replaced. Sure as you do buy with out being prepared then the heating and air blow and the $5,000 to replace puts you behind on every thing and then what happens YOU cannot catch up.Be responsible to what you sign so get ready
zxdEYy3Iaa	Yes, lifestyles can play a huge role in this dept.  Some people simply do not understand the concept of living within one's means.  So what if you can't afford this or that...just charge it to the credit card...hey, you can pay it back later!  Right?!  (*sarcasm*)<br>  <br>  As for you and your girlfriend looking to buy a house, so long as you have the credit, now is the optimal time to buy!  With so many foreclosed homes on the market, so long as you play your cards right, you are destined to get a GREAT deal!  I work for a real estate lawyer and we are constantly getting lengthy lists of foreclosed homes from brokers and agents with whom we do lots of business.<br>  <br>  Just remember, be patient, set aside a good down payment and when you find what you want, be tenacious!  :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10469473	Well of course some are.  Some people buy houses they can't afford, then the slightest blip causes major trouble.  And people who bought houses with adjustable rate mortgages and ignored the potential higher payments until they happened were just plain foolish.  Or they ran up credit cards, then ended up in trouble.<br>  <br>  Obviously, as you say, many of the foreclosures are due to things like job loss.<br>  <br>  When you buy a house, don't listen to the realtors who will tell you "but you can afford...." and try to sell you a more expensive house than you are comfortable with.  Decide up front, what you feel you can afford and still have money left to live as you want to, and go from there.|`|qYfJcmAsaa	Yes that is fairly obvious. Lots of people are living beyond their means and would not be able to maintain their lifestyle with or without a recession. <br>  <br>  A credit crunch will just speed up the process.<br>  <br>  However, there are plenty of instances where circumstances change such as increase in mortgage payments, job loss, negative equity, increase in taxes which can push someone who could afford it into someone who couldn't.<br>  <br>  Many people were caught out because they thought they could afford a more expensive house because it would go up in value. If they couldn't afford it they'd simply sell it and make a profit. So simply they are paying for increasing their risk and a bad investment decision.<br>  <br>  The banks were very irresponsible for allowing people to do this, since someone knowledgeable in finance will have known house prices do not rise consistently forever. They never have and they never will.|`|i3PGjRRfaa	SOME - try just about ALL of the foreclosures are due to people spending more than they can afford.............dumbasses.|`|rfbEnpKgaa	I think so, there are definitely some irresponsible people who live above their means.

Uo2qhkCuaa	yes. <br>  <br>  If you are required to complete a return, they are normally issued to you at the beginning of April each year. The basic return is 10 pages but many sources of income require supplementary pages to be completed as well. Some people receive a short tax return of only 4 pages.<br>  <br>  As well as your income it deals with the allowances and reliefs that you can claim.<br>  <br>  Paper returns have to be filed by 31 October following the end of the tax year and HMRC will calcualte your liability for you. For online returns you have until 31 January following the end of the tax year to file the return. If you file the tax return online through the HMRC website the software will calculate your tax liability for you.<br>  <br>  If the return isn't filed by the due date, there is an automatic fine of ￡100, which is reduced to the level of tax due if that is less. There is a further ￡100 fine if your return is still outstanding six months later.<br>  <br>  The method of payment usually involves two payments on account of your tax liability as follows...<br>  <br>  one on 31 January during the tax year and<br>  another on 31 July following the tax year.<br>  These are based on the net income tax and Class 4 NIC liability of the previous tax year .<br>  <br>  A final payment (or repayment) is due on 31 January following the tax year.<br>  <br>  Thereafter, there is a 5% surcharge on any taxes that remain unpaid after 28 February, and a further 5% on taxes not paid after 31 July.<br>  <br>  For example...<br>  <br>  If your total tax liability for 2007/08 is ￡5,000 and for 2008/09 is ￡10,000, you will make payments for 2008/09 as follows...<br>  <br>  On 31/1/09 - ￡2500 (half of the 2007/08 total)<br>  <br>  On 31/7/09 - ￡2500 (half of the 2007/08 total)<br>  <br>  On 31/1/10 - ￡10,000 (being the ￡5000 balance due for 2008/09 and ￡5000 - half of 2008/09 - on account of 2009/10)<br>  <br>  In calculating the level of instalments any tax due on capital gains of the previous year is ignored. All CGT is paid as part of the final payment due on 31 January following the end of the tax year.<br>  <br>  The payments on account are not required if...<br>  <br>  income tax and NIC liability for the previous year (net of tax deducted at source) is below ￡500 (doubled to ￡1000 from 2009/10 with first payment affected being 31 January 2010) or<br>  more than 80% of the income tax and NIC liability for the previous year was tax deducted at source.<br>  <br>  You can also apply to have the payments on account reduced if you expect your liability for a tax year to be less than the previous year|`|SyuGWtq0aa	Yes but you have until 31st January 2010 to do it online....I started a business on 26th February last year and was asked to fill in self assessment.|`|QoVL5cDHaa	Yes, if you start before 5th April.

kFKA8SXraa	It really is up to you, how often you are asked to travel and how long (time) are the trips. You can normally take advantage of keeping air miles,with nice dinners and lunch. The travel experience is always a (+).<br>  This issues are usually discussed when hired.|`|6KvrIX6yaa	You should be paid for your time anytime you are on company time, including your time traveling to and from the conference.  They should also be paying for any meals, tolls, mileage you incur driving to and from the airport, parking costs, etc.  Anything you have to pay for that you would not be paying for if you were not traveling for business purposes.  Every company I have ever worked for has paid their hourly employees for this time.  Salaried employees obviously only get paid expenses incurred.|`|wiwRWIDZaa	I think the company should pay you for air time...this is a business trip....if it such a small company they would not be able to afford your airfare and hotel accomidations.

Wehjuvpmaa	Have you called the tax preparer and told them that the IRS didn't get your refund?  You have to remember tht people working in these shops are part time temporary people and you may want to call and ask for the manager and explain that the IRS said that they have not recieved your refund and ask then to check thier computer to make sure that it was sent AND that it was ACKNOWLEDGED.....these things happen sometimes...but you need to check and make sure that the tax preparer sent it....I'm dealing with this in my tax shop right now...one of the workers this year sent someones return who was asking for the instant money...the instant money was declined and therefor the return was never sent to the irs because if the instant money is declined then you have to resend the return with a different box checked...it was never resent...client called yesterday VERY angry because the return was never resent...in our computer it looked like it was sent and the check was declined and that they would have to wait for the two week check......when actually the whole return was sent and rejected before the IRS ever saw it......we are refunding the clients prep fees and are very sorry that it happened but these workers are temp....and that what you get......in fact, that worker has already been cut because the tax season has slowed down.......so call them and explain that the IRS does not have your return....btw don't count your chickens until they hatch - never depend on money you do not have yet because computers go out and people make mistakes and its not yours until its in your hands.|`|zuGKIWfNaa	You can't sue your tax preparer because the IRS is taking the time to check everyone's returns extra carefully this year. If you browse through this section of Y!A, you will see that pretty much EVERYONE is finding their refund taking longer than they expected it to.<br>  <br>  And if you count on your tax refund to pay bills -- you really need to come up with a better way of managing your finances.|`|f5f29f78cbffd9771950da5ad0141cafaa	First, if you depend on your refund to pay your bills, then you are already in trouble. However, if your tax preparer tells you that he e-filed your return, then ask him what is the DCN. DCN is the IRS acceptance number, this number will provide you the assurance that the IRS has received and accepted your return. If you had any Federal Debt, such as, Student Loans, Child Support, then the IRS will keep all of your refund and don't expect to get any money.
GSJ9gqVWaa	Don't give the SSN until you are actually offered a job.  You don't know until you actually get offered a job whether they are for real, and it doesn't make sense to have your SNN floating around for no reason.

In some places, the age discrimination laws make it necessary for firms to avoid those making hiring decisions knowing ages, to avoid claims for discrimination.  Unless asked to include it, you probably should avoid putting it on.|`|wP3gbXBTaa	Very bad idea.

Since you don't seem to have heard, there's what's being called a credit crunch, due to banks lending money to people who couldn't continue to pay their mortgages.<br>  That leads to foreclosure (ie the houses you want to buy).  Some of these folks couldn't document their income (via tax return).  So why would the banks loan $ to you, if your issues helped lead to this collapse in the first place?|`|3HR1SfGMaa	Many of those foreclosed homes have become that way because of speculators and "flippers"  Now is not the time to try to flip houses unless you want to join the people who have bitten off more than they can chew.
FAWxOmBxaa	Your first step is to speak with the perpetrator calmly and professionally to let her know that you don't appreciate her behavior towards you.  Let her know that she is creating a hostile work environment for you and if it doesn't stop you will go to management.  Then stick to your guns. If the behavior doesn't stop then go to management.  They will appreciate that you have tried to do something about this on your own instead of being a tattle tail.  Say to them "I've tried to address this with blank as co workers but she continued to behave this way even after I've asked her to stop."  If when you are speaking with her she escalates the conversation to confrontation simply state "I'm sorry you're not willing to be professional about this" and walk away then talk to the manager.|`|6aMRLC9jaa	I had something like this happen to me.  I went to HR "not to make a complaint" but to have them document such and such for that if I ever left it would be not on my own accord but because I was being abused.

Anyways, they did an investigation and she got demoted.

Does everyone else notice this too? It sounds to me like she may have a mental problem, in which case you could probably diffuse her energy by being friendly with her. Does she have a job to do? I can't imagine an employer putting up with this. As an adult, I think you can probably "take it" and just ignore her, unless she actually causes harm, but if you feel you must, you could certainly talk to your employer about it, or ask around and see if she annoys others too.|`|02023201c466ca1751d4f14fb53cd526aa	Yes.   Let your manager know that this is not professional behavior.   You expect to work in a professional workplace.  Let them know that you are a professional and act like one. <br>  <br>  If management refuses to do anything, it might be considered harrassment.   You might contact the Department of Labor in your state.<br>  <br>  If you can, you might want to wear ear plugs to work.

n3cAst1Taa	Mental health providers set their own fees and bill accordingly. You should charge what you think is a reasonable fee for your services. If you are doing billing for someone else, you need to find out what fees they will be charging. That is the fee schedule. What you will be reimbursed by third-party payers is a different matter. As you have learned, Medicare has a set fee schedule and they pay mental health providers half of what they are allowed to charge. Other payers reimburse based on contract, participation in provider panels, and usual, customary and reasonable (UCR) rates.|`|URO3gDXcaa	you can bill what you want.  there is no schedule that tells you what to bill for any state.  you just have to make the contractual adjustments in your billing.|`|9AUmp5jWaa	Fee schedules vary.  They go by a contracted amount.  I doubt you will be able to find anything set in stone.
Hx88UGlpaa	Brian...you need to consult with a qualified bankruptcy attorney on how to handle this money. Most will see you free the first time. If you take the money and transfer it somewhere else, and the trustee finds out, your bankruptcy case can be dismissed. The trustees look at all activity from the past 6 months, not 3, They can request that you take the money to pay down some debts, so the best advice I can give you is to contact a bankruptcy attorney and get in to see them to get the legal advice you need. You want to make sure you do the correct thing and not "think" you have the money safe and sound, then lose it and not be able to do what you'd like to do. You can review the bankruptcy website at www.usbankruptcy.gov   It may give you more information that you need. Good Luck!|`|l5cxmTb9aa	Well you can be a weasel and try to get out of the commitments you made or you can do the right thing. Chances are if you don't do the right thing it will come back and bite you. They can access records that will show the money you have/had. You're not bankrupt if you have money. Filing bankruptcy should be a desperate last resort and will leave a black mark on your record.<br>  <br>  The right thing to do is to contact the mortgage holder, tell them your situation and put the house up for sale. Fortunately you've been smart and have a cushion to see you through. Use a little of the money you have to make the house look presentable. List with a realtor who can advise you on pricing and appearance for a quick sale. You can then leave and find a new place where you want to move or find a temp job where you are now. Anything will do. WalMart greeter, grocery stocking, pizza delivery.<br>  I don't recommend buying a trailer since they depreciate so quickly. If you wanted to buy one used for almost nothing that might be okay. Price out what it's going to cost for monthly fees and see what the alternatives are.<br>  I'm assuming you already have a job lined up after you move.|`|GSJ9gqVWaa	If you go bankrupt all your assets are used to pay off your creditors.  If there is anything left after they are paid off, you get that.  Don't get any ideas about giving the money to a friend or family member.

bVsz2VhDaa	The first step is to contact the HR department or Payroll office of your employer. They should be more than happy to send you another copy of your W-2 form. Make sure that your employer has your correct address. If they haven’t mailed it, you may be able to pick it up in person. Some companies may also allow you to access it online. Your company may charge you fee to send you another copy of your W-2 form.<br>  <br>  <br>  If, for some reason, your employer refuses to send you your W-2 form, you can contact the IRS at 1-800-829-1040. Have a recent pay stub handy so that you can answer their questions. They dislike it when businesses don’t comply with the tax laws and will make sure your employer sends you one.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If your employer has gone out of business, call the IRS. Make sure you have the employer’s name, last known address, employer ID number as well as your own employee information. Most of this can be found on a previous pay stub. The IRS will attempt to contact your previous employer and mail you a Form 4852. Use the information on your pay stub to fill out this form and submit it in place of your W-2 form when you file your taxes. You will need a separate form for each missing W-2 form. Your refund may be delayed while the IRS verifies the information you provided on Form 4852.|`|550e4912823fee98e745442e7bdab33faa	Ask your employer for a duplicate.|`|paerqxfMaa	Call the employer that issued it for a duplicate OR you can contact the IRS and get it from them.|`|gIUdTXCAaa	Depends on who you work for.

If that does not work, then you can call your phone co and request they put a tracer on the calls. Then the collection agency will have a new problem to deal with.|`|9972cdeaacdbbbcad131174971c64b6baa	First off, the next time they call you should tell them that they are not to contact you or anyone else about this debt by phone ever again.  Tell them the FCRA (fair credit reporting act) and FDCPA (fair debt collection practice act) states that once you inform them that they can't call you anymore, that they are no longer legally able to call you.<br>  <br>  Second, if they don't send you something in WRITING about the debt, they can't legally go after you for it at all.  Now this is a little tricky, because often times they will state in their records that they sent you a letter without actually sending it so they can attempt to make things worse on you.  Your next step is to WRITE A LETTER stating that you want to know the balance they state you owe, a DETAILED list of the charges that led to the balance (according to law, the ORIGINAL creditor has to keep this information to continue pursuing you on it), what account number it's for and who the original creditor was.<br>  <br>  Make sure you do NOT admit to owing the debt, just state that you want the information claiming you owe the debt.  If they can't/don't provide it, you can actually go after them for $1,000 per infringement.  You should also include a statement in that letter that they are not to contact you by phone.<br>  <br>  Next, after they actually send you the letter with the info, you should try to see if you can come up with 80% of the debt you owe, and offer that to them in a follow up letter.  Let them know it's a 1 time deal and it's not up for negotiation.  Tell them you are NOT agreeing to actually owing the debt, you just want to try and settle it so it can stop impacting your credit.<br>  <br>  Charge offs only stay on your credit for 7 years (and only will hit your husband's credit if your name isn't on the account) from the date of the charge off, that's even if you don't pay them.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure you always send it certified mail and KEEP YOUR RECEIPTS.|`|Jzb55jZhaa	A lot of times people say they are the manager when they arent.

4ooXYuYFaa	It is called an interest only loan. Pretty common loan and part of what has gotten us into this mess in the first place. The only way for her to pay down the priciple is to pay MORE than the "payment due" amount on the statement that she receives each month. <br>  <br>  This really is not that unusual - a lot of people took out interest only loans because they thought their homes would appreciate in value enough to offset them not paying any principle. This obviously hasn't been the case.<br>  <br>  Now, where I'm confused is the fact that the banker said "you have no mortgage". THAT is a bit odd and I'm not sure what that's all about. I would definately have her look into this. Have her ask for a copy of her loan documents. She is absolutely entitled to get this. IF in fact there is NOT a mortgage, then I'd tell her to quit sending them money.

If you wanted to renew the lease why didn't you do so at the 90 day notice.  Did you ask for a copy of the lease in writing?  Since she sent a 90 and 60 day notice to you and didnt' hear from you she is assuming that you are not staying.  and to protect herself she is giving you written notice that since the lease will expire and you did not renew, she is terminating the lease.<br>  <br>  If you want to stay go sign the papers.  And get out of the low income house that I am paying for.

Now it depends on the withdrawal rights at the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
AcgDcQG0aa	I think any shareholder is free to sell all of his shares to anybody he wants and at any price he wants.  Trading in the stock market using insider knowledge is against the SEC rules.  But if he sells his shares in a private deal in a way that by-passes the stock market.  Then his sale might be legal.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to check out SEC rules and perhaps ask someone at SEC about the legality of this deal.<br>  <a href="http://www.sec.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sec.gov/</a>|`|8aa2ea728deb10155c8014220bf22a62aa	Hi!  I'll try to answer your questions to the best of my ability.  I do have some education in this area but it was a little while ago.<br>  <br>  1.  Yes, this is completely legal.  The new owners are buying up all of his shares in order to gain a controlling interest of the company.  The issue of trust comes into play.  I hope that he didn't ask anyone to take pay cuts recently.  Because if he did, he would definitely have violated my trust!  All in all, he is protecting his own interests.<br>  <br>  2.  Yes, I believe that this can happen.  But not from the CEO.  If my memory serves me correctly, all remaining shareholders have the right to demand that the new owners buy up their shares as well for the same price.  I think that they call this "piggyback".  Best way to be sure is to look at the fine print and be sure of the rights and obligations of your shares.<br>  <br>  3.  Yes, a shareholder meeting must be held eventually for the purposes of converting from a private to a public company.  But I am unsure as to whether or not this has to happen before the CEO sells his shares to the new owners.  Intuition says that probably not...but check it out.<br>  <br>  4.  Yes, he does have to send a notice to all shareholders prior to a merger taking place.  Such a structural change requires shareholder approval.  But fiduciary responsibility?  Don't be so sure.  Do you have any shareholder agreements in place?  Is there in existence a unanimous shareholder agreement?  Usually, a CEO's primary fiduciary responsibility is to the Board.<br>  <br>  In any case, take all of my answers with a grain of salt.  My answers are only designed to point you in the right direction and I cannot guarantee accuracy.  Best thing is to consult a lawyer would specializes in corporate and commercial law as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
U3jZFawtaa	It depends on if its an experienced landlord/owner and their experience. Experienced landlords can size up a situation and approve him. If he has references that he paid rent well the last few years and good explanations on his bad credit he should be ok. What might be in his favor right now is that the economy has ruined many people's credit so many are applying with recent "dings" He might look better if he has had some past problems but paying good now...it shows he might be past the rough time and it might make him look more reliable. However its up to the individual so get some letters from previous landlords and a letter as to what happened and he learned his lessons and will be a great tenant. Good Luck|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	He still have to apply, and all background checks have to be done.<br>  <br>  However, as you are already there he will likely be allowed to stay, as long as he is not some sort of criminal.|`|rnfxNYx3aa	He has to qualify just as you did.

Bu4n8YdEaa	This guy is great, check it out:<br>  <br>  Selling in a recession isn't much different than selling in any other time, there is just less room for error.  The following attitudes and behaviors can be applied throughout the sales process in order to help build trust and credibility with your prospects and customers.  <br>  <br>  1. Become a business consultant to your customers.  In tough times, it is essential to listen to your customers, understand their issues, provide insightful support and do all that you can to help them survive.  Make sure you really understand their business and how your products or services impact them directly.  Think of yourself as a consultant.  Less telling and more listening, and always look for ways to add value.<br>  <br>  2. Be innovative.  You can easily position yourself as a trusted advisor with your prospects and customers by offering differentiated solutions that are in response to your customer's unique business challenges.  Customers really value new ideas and insights that will help them compete in turbulent times.<br>  <br>  3. Do your research.  Since your customers value insight then it is essential that you out-work your competition in this area.  Invest your time researching your customer's own customers, segments, competitors, employees and challenges.  You want to have an in-depth understanding of their vision, strengths and weaknesses if you are to add value.<br>  <br>  4. Determine your priorities.  Call on your account list with purpose rather than indiscriminately.  When times are tough you must determine which accounts require the most focus, attention and resources.  You can determine this based on a number of factors (size, volume, growth, competition, product fit and profitability).<br>  <br>  5. Focus on the relationship and results.  When tough times exist, companies focus on results more than ever.  Your customer is focused on their results and your company is focused on yours.  It is important that you find the balance between their needs and yours.  You are looking for win-win solutions.  Don't try and beat them in the short term.  You may end up losing them in the long-term.  They need to know that they mean everything to you.  This is the time for you to be "Jerry Maguire" (from the movie) to your customers.<br>   <br>  <br>  Michael Vickers<br>  Summit Learning Systems, Inc<br>  www.michaelvickers.com|`|wwzoqIvVaa	Times are tough now, esp. in sales, I would imagine.  Follow your employers guidelines.  They probably have a system they use with specifics.  Good luck and I hope things improve - for us all!

2N6oTOLQaa	Good for you, you're on the right track.<br>  <br>  There's no magic number regarding how low a credit card company will go to get a settlement. They simply want as much money as possible, so if they think they can get $1600 by offering you a settlement that's better than having a $2700 debt on the books that you never pay. <br>  <br>  I would start by offering them about $1200 for the debt, and see where that gets you. Never accept a first offer. But if they don't budge, $1600 is a good deal since it allows you to pay this debt off in 4 months. <br>  <br>  The key to dealing will collections people is to get everything in writing. Don't send them a dime until you have your agreement in writing in your hand. Never send payment based on a verbal promise of a settlement and never send it based on a promise that the paperwork is in the mail. Keep good records and make sure their paperwork clearly states the payment structure, and the fact that those payments settle the debt in full. <br>  <br>  Congratulations on being on the road to being debt free.|`|BT7JeMx3aa	It really depends on the situation, but based on what you say, that may be the best answer for you. It may be a hassle to have to send out four payments every month, but it sounds like you're not worried about that. You could consider Care One Credit counseling. They are only $25 a month and it lowers the monthly payments.|`|0d48b95c977a1e94afbc64b60d0d2d75aa	If you're comfortable with the settlement take it. But make sure you get it in writing first. Also send them money orders, no personal checks because they can always debit your account later.|`|1F6KJt0oaa	I don't know what you did but I have tried to talk to all of my creditors and none of them will offer me deals.  They will allow me to pay $400 a month until I get caught up or whatever but none will settle and none will lower interest and none will do anything for me.  I went with CareOne as well and so far it has been a life saver.  I will be paid off in a lot less time than I had ever imagined and I have the extra room in my budget to get everything else in order as well.  I imagine a lot of the money going to creditors and banks is making it easier to get deals like that but I guess I am just with some hard cookies.  Given that as an option I would take it.  It would be a great benefit to have one of the cards paid off if you can afford to make those payments.|`|K2h6M1xqaa	The credit card companies are scrambling.<br>  <br>  They know that a very high percentage of people are going to be filing for bankruptcy within the next year and that means they'll lose everything "owed" to them.<br>  <br>  They also want to snag all they can now while the dollar still holds some value.<br>  <br>  If/when hyper-inflation sets in, (as is very likely) then one cruddy paycheck from McDonald's will be able to pay off your entire debt.  This doesn't mean you'll necessarily have any food on the table or a roof over your head, but it does mean, unless I'm missing some vital point, that credit card debt will be the least of your concerns.<br>  <br>  I'd almost recommend that people buy gold bullion on credit and sell it again after the economy crashes and recovers using the Amero, or whatever unified currency they'll end up adopting.  --I'd almost recommend that, except you can't eat precious metal.  When food becomes the most precious commodity, you'll be trying to trade diamonds for potatoes.  Why not buy some taters now when they're still cheap?<br>  <br>  Weird times up ahead.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  --And stick close to family and friends.  Nobody will be able to come through this alone.|`|oOn5LOtQaa	Get it in writing! Its the most important step. Nothing will hold up without written proof. Also Be sure to cut up those credit cards and NEVER use them again.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Of course take the deals.  this way you clean up your debt and worry free.  Then try banking that monthly payment as long as you are used to doing without.  Build yourself an emergency fund.  You will sleep better.

GSJ9gqVWaa	Obviously english language and literature.  Maths is a must in any job.  But all those are mandatory in most schools any way.  If you want to avoid driving the subs (Sub editors, a term you will get very familiar with over the next few decades) crazy, I suggest at least double science, ideally triple.  Beyond that, anything that increases your understanding of the world around you.  I think Law and Economics would both be good, as they would give you a basic grasp of a major area of news.  But I am studying law and economics, so I would say that.  Business studies might be useful.  If you have any area you have a real passion and aptitude for, pursue it.  Not only will you get your best grades if you like the subject, it might be an area you can specialise in during your career.  My father, who worked at a major daily paper for 20 years, and spent most of his life in print journalism, said that media studies looks really bad, and is basically the kiss of death for any job application in journalism.  However I have heard different from other sources.  You might want to approach a local paper and ask them what they look for.  The worst that can happen is that you have had your first brush off from a company, in what will hopefully be a long career of trying to get information from people and companies who are not always eager to tell you what happened.<br>  <br>  I would guess that geography would look good, and history.  Papers (and broadcasters) like to be sure you aren't going to write copy (articles) that confuse Paris, France with Paris Island, South Carolina, USA, or misdate the act of union.<br>  <br>  If you want more details about the career of a journalist, you should look at the British Government website, Jobs4U.  The address is below, in sources.<br>  <br>  If you want to become a journalist, you might want to try just hitting Google with any questions like this, as well as asking here, to practice research.<br>  <br>  Is there a school paper you could join?  That would look good to editors.<br>  <br>  Jobs4U lists starting pay for a print journalist as ￡12,000, although this varies a lot.  A sub editor traineee for The Sun probably earns at least twice that.<br>  <br>  You should try and expose yourself to a variety of media, including both tabloid and broadsheet newspapers, broadcast news channels, broadcast (TV and radio) news bulletins, both local and national.  <br>  <br>  Tabloid papers are papers such as The Sun.  They are usually in what is known as tabloid format (shape), and have quite populist journalism, with big headlines, often containing a pun.  They sometimes have soft core porn on page 3.  Their masthead (name along the top of the front page) is often red.  For this reason they are also known as red tops.  <br>  <br>  Broadsheets are usually slightly larger, and concentrate on news rather than entertainment.  They usually simply state facts except in clearly marked 'Leader' or opinion peices, which are unsigned, and appear in the same place edition.  Broad sheets rarely carry a picture on more than half the front page.  They are papers such as the Times and Guardian.|`|0VUFAa6raa	hi, i finished my gcse's last year and believe me they're not that important. i too want to become a journalist or something involving the media but took completely random gcses [the normal compulsory ones: English lit and language, double science, maths, PRSE [Re short course] and IT as well as some really random ones: food tech, geography, PE and performing arts]<br>  honestly gcse's don't matter that much, as long as you take ones which you know you can get high grades so that you will be able to get into a sixth form or collage and take A levels, or a journalism course. I'm going to my school sixth form after getting good grades in the gcses, now if you want to do journalism at uni then you should concentrate on picking a levels which are appropriate to journalism [I've chosen English language, biology, media and geography].<br>  As for work, it's unlikely that you'll get a paid job while in school [secondary school i mean] but you can get an early start with work experience in year 11 and in sixth form/college by appling to the local paper. You'll spend either a week or a few weeks working in and around a productive atmosphere where you should get a feel for the job and see if you want to persue it. If you're lucky they may ask you to write a story that will be published. In the mean time you can send samples of your work to multiple magazines in order to get yourself known and you never know, you might get published and that'll look great on your CV. [By the way, that last bit was suggested to me by an actual journalist so it's solid advice as she's done it herself]|`|AA11570675	GCSEs aren't that important to a career so much as your own character & interests.<br>  You'll need the basics in english, so go for both language & literature. You'll also need a basic framework of understanding & interpreting the world & events, so the traditional subjects of history & geography would work well plus a science of your choosing. Beyond this, at GCSE level, go for the stuff you're good at & enjoy.<br>  A levels are more important & you will want to try studying English, History & Psychology.<br>  Most local papers will start you off somewhere near minimum wage, but very few employers will readily take on somebody they don't know fresh out of school into a full time job, so get to know your local newspaper & their staff & show them you're interested. Write & tell them of your interest & ask to visit, then keep in touch & ask if you can submit articles. It would impress them more than all the academic subjects if you join or start a school or college newspaper, in fact your local newspaper might give you a lot of help & advice in taking that on as a project. It's by getting to know the business & the people that you'll get your first foot in the door, in fact that's probably more important than your choice of subjects at GCSE.<br>  You've got your sights set on a very interesting career. I hope you enjoy it & have a lot of fun. Best of luck..|`|d1daf3b2f658eaebd75e3da606cb4730aa	At this stage you need to focus on getting a good all round education, but there are areas you can start to focus on a little. <br>  <br>  Obviously English lit and Language are important (yes both of them).<br>  History is good as, the more you understand about the past, the better you can comment on future events.<br>  Similarly you may want to look at an economics, business or politics course. What are of journalism are you particularly interested in? If you want to be a sports journalist how about taking sports? interested in reporting on culture? then drama or music could be good. Society? then what about psychology, sociology or religious studies.<br>  <br>  Having good GCSEs in maths and sciences will also help you in going for A levels later on.

QoVL5cDHaa	When you completed form P46, it wasn't your first job, so current employer no doubt correctly put you on emergency tax,(603L?) on a week or month 1 basis. We are now near the end of the tax year on 5th April, so it will nearing final payroll, and too late to amend code.<br>  Your earnings from your hotel count towards your taxable income. It wasn't exempt, just that you were earning below the taxable limit of ￡6035 a year. Can you do an estimate? If your total earnings for this tax year are less than the taxable limit, the amount won't really matter.<br>  When you phone HRMC they ask a lot of security questions, because there are a lot of debt collectors and private detectives out there trying to get information on people. They can be very plausible, and HMRC tries to protect your privacy.<br>  I think your best course of action now is to send form P60 (when you get it in another month or so) to tax office, together with details of your employment history since the start of the tax year on 06/04/08. You can download form P91 from <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk</a> , then go into individuals and employees, then forms. That will give you the required format.

mwkfirjRaa	It won't work the way you expect it to because interest will still accrue on your first mortgage.  However, there is another approach you can take that will help you to save interest and rapidly pay down your mortgage.<br>  <br>  It only works if you are a sophisticated consumer and you are disciplined enough to stay on budget.  And, you have to keep your expenses to no more than 90% of your income.<br>  <br>  It's called mortgage acceleration and here is how it works:<br>  <br>  If your lender allows, apply all your income as principal only payments to your 1st mortgage.  Pay all your bills, including the regular 1st mortgage payment, from your equity line of credit.  Eventually, the 1st mortgage will be paid off completely.  You will have a significant balance on your equity line, but it will be much less than your 1st mortgage balance would have been had you made only the regularly scheduled monthly payments.<br>  <br>  When you have only the equity line remaining, apply all your income as principal-only payments against your equity line.  Continue to pay all your bills from the equity line.  This assumes your lender allows you to make principal-only payments.<br>  <br>  The benefits of this approach are that you pay off your mortgage in a fraction of the time without losing access to all your equity.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	You cannot come out a head by borrowing money at a higher interest rate to pay off a loan at a lower interest rate.<br>  <br>  The total owed is not decreasing.

No new money is getting added to the mix.<br>  <br>  There are expensive computer programs that claim that if you put all of your money (paycheck) into a specific bank account, they will combine it with a HELOC and then maximize the amount of money applied to the principal at any given time.  As you pay your bills, the amount of the HELOC debt rises, then falls again when the next paycheck comes in.  In theory, this works--but the interest saved rarely covers the cost of the software and people typically think they are saving more money than they are and go spend the "savings" getting deeper in debt.|`|0d48b95c977a1e94afbc64b60d0d2d75aa	Star Gazer is right. Even if you just pay an extra $50 per month, that would cut down on the interest. Most  loans are simple interest. Also bare  in mind that is you pay past the due date, you are charged add'l interest, it's called per-diem. You will notice on your amortization, on the first 15 years, you pay most of the interest. That's how most of not all banks work,|`|qNVP4Q1Saa	You will have to pay interest on the money you pull from the equity line to pay the mortgage anyway. The trouble is that Next month you will have two payments to make.  One to the mortgage which is not negotiable and the other to the equity line so you will have twice the mortgage. It would save money if you didn't have to pay it back though.  Nice thought, but ni cigar|`|okh0RNr4aa	yup

You must disclose your intent at that time as well.<br>  <br>  You may be subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino rules. The rules are somewhat particular, so you should read through them yourself or get legal assistance. They are meant to prevent anti-competitive mergers.<br>  <br>  Shareholders may just not sell to you and may vote against you at an annual meeting. About 9% of Famous Daves is held by insiders who may not vote with you.<br>  <br>  Managers can fight back. They may have implemented a poison pill or other anti-takeover measures. They can grant contracts to employees and other that would make the merger non-economic (as Yahoo! did when they fought off Microsoft). They may sue you and they can spend the company's money to fight you. Also, you may have to wait to the next annual shareholder meeting before you can vote off the board. If the board is "staggered", that may take years.<br>  <br>  Finally, there are state law to consider. Hershey's fended off a takeover bid based upon Pennsylvania law, not federal law.<br>  <br>  All in all, you need to hire a good law firm with experience in the matter. By the way, you need to consider any debt that they have (which you will be assuming) as well as any options that they have granted (which will be turned into shares).<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Remember, the earliest age that you can receive Social Security retirement benefits remains 62 even though the FRA is rising.<br>  In the year you reach your FRA: $1 in benefits will be deducted for each $3 you earn above a different limit, but only counting earnings before the month you reach FRA. For 2009, this limit is $37,680; for 2008, this limit is $36,120. <br>  Starting with the month you reach FRA:, you will get your benefits with NO limit on your earnings. <br>  <br>  Your FRA is probably 66.

If they don't reduce or waive the bill, you can take your complaint to the regulator (the actual regulator depends on the gas provider).

But the code on the W2 stated "Sick Benefit" in box 14.  the same amount was listed in box 1 but in the state wages it was blank.   I would think it might fall under "other"|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	For federal taxes, the amount in box 1 is taxable.

So do not check "yes" for any of them.

2zgv89OQaa	I certainly can understand you wanting to follow your life-long dream to a police officer.  It's so admirable.   The only drawback I have to this is if a year ago you got disqualified because of the background, you have to realise that could happen again.  Do you have any idea what it was and if it's something you can clear up.  I would try that first before leaving the business you and your father has started.

What changed about that that would qualify you for it if you tried again?  <br>  <br>  If you thought you could pass it later on, you shouldn't have started the trucking business with your dad.  If you really think that you can pass the Police Department, just explain it to your dad that you want to try again and I'm sure he will be disappointed but in the end will understand.  You just have to be honest with him and tell him before you actually try to qualify again.|`|TgUOMBIKaa	You could sit down and write the pros and cons of both jobs.
