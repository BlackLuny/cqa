20090309140645AAtOKyP	Business & Finance;Small Business	How much should I charge for creating dvds out of precious memories?	I'm 14, and trying to make a few extra bucks. I'm pretty good with compuers. So, here is my thinking. I'm going to take people's videos and put them into a VERY professional dvd. Like you see when you buy one from the store. The outside cover isn't going to have a cool design (so far, I may later), but the actual menu screen will look cool. I'll put them as one video, or different videos, burn it to a dvd disk, and charge the person I doing it for. I'm also doing slide shows with a person's photos. I'll let them pick the music, and if I have to buy the music, I'll include that in the total cost.       Here was what I was thinking for price.      $25 flat fee - for labor a supplies (minus special supplies for one particular person's order, like havin to buy music)      Then $2 for each additional disk they want it burned on. My mom told me that was too cheap. So now it's somewhere between 5-10 dollars.       Once they hit 5 disks, the price goes down a little for each one. Then 10, a little more off price, 20, a little more off price, you get the picture. Until I get to the lowest of $4.50 per disk.       Now with slide shows, for every 100 photos that would be $10.       Please tell me if I'm overpricing or if they are too cheap. This is a great alternative for me because in my area, there is too much competition for lawn mowing, baby sitting, yard work, or any other odd jobs. I also, me being a kid and all, want to get as much out of this as possible, without them feeling like all i care about is the money or I'm ripping them off. I'd rather get paid ONLY $10 for the job than them think that. The job would take a week at most, maybe a few days. THANKS FOR ALL THE HELP! :-)

After a couple of weeks with no contact they contacted me to ask why the refund hasn't arrived. I e-mailed back to say the game hadn't arrived yet.      Where can I go from here? Is it acceptable for me to ask for proof of postage before I refund, bearing in mind I haven't received the goods back?
20090309145306AAa4VEM	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Ideas for Work for a Woman with ADD and Social Anxiety?	I'm looking for ideas for income for a woman with ADD and Social Anxiety. Her biggest problem is she can't deal with people very well at all, especially for prolonged periods or repeatedly over time. She does much better with people she only talks to briefly. Coworkers and bosses are the hardest for her. She can't do simple things like ask questions, ask for help, explain herself, stand up for herself, make suggestions, etc., and because of the ADD, she has a really hard time absorbing instructions and remembering things.      She has an English degree and writes really well, but because of the ADD, she does everything really slowly, and she can't concentrate or focus for long. I think online medical billing and things like that require too much concentration and perfection (she makes transcription errors and gets confused with numbers, etc.)      I've been looking at online work, but so much of it looks like scams and requires her to invest money before fully disclosing what she'd be doing and how much she'd make. I also looked into piece work, but it would work out to only a few cents per hour and leave her no time for anything more serious.      Anybody got any more ideas?

I have a homework question -  it’s taken me 3 days so far but I just can’t arrive at an answer!  I thought that to calculate the capital figure you take the assets and subtract the liabilities? But following a guide on setting out balance sheet, this only gives me the working capital figure.  How do I calculate the Capital?      I’ve set it out properly but have shortened it here:      :   Fixed Assets total 68,035      Current Assets total 8,757      Current Liabilities total 6,462      Makes a WORKING capital of 2,295      Financed by   Capital     ? (how do I work this out?)   Plus Net Profit     14,970      Drawings     11,6000      The second part of my question requires that I prepare a capital account so I need the capital figure before I go any further.

My income is 40 k a year and I have a decent credit score ( 700s). I don't have any payments except for my car payment which is $188 a month and my credit card payments which I will pay off before I try to qualify for a loan.  I am a first time home buyer.    I 've been with my company for almost three years and I ve been at the present position for a year and a half.    But I have a doubt whether I should try to qualify for a loan.    The problem is that for the last year and a half I've been working as a part time employee. ( I still average 60 hours every two weeks).      So my question is: will a mortgage lender  let it pass, or I won't be able to qualify for a mortgage because my income is not considered to be stable?      Thanks a lot!

Yeah, obviously no one can get a loan for that amount considering the low income. What if 200000 is put down as down-payment and a balance of 50000. Can or will a lender loan 50000 to complete the transaction? with an excellent credit score of 785. No other debt other then 1 $500 credit card debt. Will any lender approve this considering the income? According to mortgage calculators out there, 18000 annual income should be able to loan 50000plus.  Your take

My daughter had her family bank account cleaned out by a fraudulent Paypal transaction that was nothing to do with her. Neither she or her husband used Paypal other than for an occasional sale of things on Ebay. However, someone in Europe managed to buy goods to the value of  ￡1500 and charge them to their account without them knowing, until well after the event. Her bank has been very helpful in recovering most of the money and will refund the balance but Paypal have been terribly un-cooperative and wanted to charge her for sorting the problem out! Be warned do not link your main bank account or any credit card with a high limit to Paypal it is just no safe.

I received a 1099 Misc. form to report my income, but I can't figure out how to do this.

20090309174159AAUD9t0	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Why do I feel so much pressure to buy a house?	I am 24, going to be 25 this summer, my husband is about to turn 24. I have a little girl that is 8 1/2 months old. We just moved to California from the Midwest and are really feeling pressure to buy. My reservations are, however, that I will not like the small town that we are looking in (because we can afford it) and I am not sure how long I want to live where we are. Is anyone else feeling the pressure to buy? Should I be feeling this pressure even though we are a young family only two years out of college? I would love to hear you thoughts....thanks!!!!

20090309163643AAKzf71	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	Unemployment Appeal about a drug screen?	I was going through a probationary period with a temporary agency. The assignment was for one year. At the end of the one year I was to be hired back on with the company full-time. The day before my UA I signed a consent form for the UA. That night I took an at-home test and the results were questionable. they say that if there is even a faint line, that you are supposed to treat it as a negative result, but i was concerned about the clinical test. so,I talked with the company's Production Manager who administered the UA consent form stating that I didnt think I would pass the UA.         MY Statement from the temp agency:         ...Katie said that (the Production Manager) told her that she was to have the drug screening on the 7th and that she had "prepared for that" but when she was asked to take the test, they had used an at home kit and didn't pass, so they went in and told (production mgr) that she wouldn't pass the UA. the Production Mgr said she "might as well forget it then and leave and not plan to return to work unless called" Katie said that she had been talking to the President and the Vice President about the situation and about returning. I reminded her that (temp agency) also has drug and alcohol policies and that most of our clients do as well, and that, given Katie's admission of inability to pass a drug test, we would no longer work with her.       So, that's my statement i gave to the temp agency. They discharged me and I filed for unemployment. The unemployment determination was ruled in my favor and I was able to collect unemployment benefits. But now, the temp agency is appealing my case stating that I DENIED a drug screen. it shows in my history transactions from the temp agency BEFORE I gave them any statement this: "INACT Katie was all set to be hired on (to the company) but declined to drug test. told them she didn't think she would pass"      I don't understand!! In no way did I decline a drug test. I went to the Production manager with a concern about my test. She canceled the test right away and told us not to come back until she called. I never even told the Production Mgr what the whole concern was about.      My hearing is on the 10th of march. I went to the company today to get the UA consent form but they said they needed to get if from another site.   Will having the consent form help me at all?   the only basis they have of denying my unemployment is that I refused to take the UA. how can i prove that i never denied taking the test?

20090227095514AAWiPL0	Business & Finance;Taxes;United Kingdom	BR Tax code for both jobs?	I was a student, so didn't work during my course. After my course I found it very hard getting a job in the height of summer - most of them had been taken. So i signed on for about 2 or 3 months.   Then in late October, I finally got a job! It was Part time and only a christmas temp job, but it paid the bills for the mean time.   I also started working a ZERO HOURS contract with another job. I knew that a BR tax code is usually issued to any job on top of your main one. So I was okay with that.      However, I finished my first job in January. But my tax code for the second (now main) job didn't change. This also didn't bother me too much as I knew I can get a tax rebate on it later. But I have also started another job now, earning ￡600-650 a month being a carer for flatmate.       My final issue I press to you to solve... how the hell do i get my Code changed on the carer's job/make it my main job - thus get a normal tax code instead of "BR"???         I have done a P46, but because it's not my only job.. i got lumped with the BR tax code.      I can't go to the tax office where the money is coming from, I have to go to my own.. or any tax office apparently. There is no employer really, just my flatmate who I care for, and the government who issue the pay to do so.         Help???
