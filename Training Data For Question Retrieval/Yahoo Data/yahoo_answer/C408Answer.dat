The type of mold you described is your problem and your responsibility.  Instead of bleach, you might wand to try a commercial mold remover.  They are available at most home centers, not too expensive, won't burn your skin and doesn't stink.|`|tjLbXhtEaa	No, your landlord is responsible for ANYTHING to do with your apartment.<br>  You could like some of my tenants call me when a light bulb is out I would have to go replace it. Luckily I only had one tenant do that... what a pain. Anyway the landlord OWNS the structure and everything to do with it. If you spring a leak in the water heater .. it is his problem so what make the mold an different?|`|DPegPYRPaa	Is it something you caused? Or is it normal wear and tear?<br>  <br>  Talk to your landlord and see what he suggests first.|`|AA10423186	yes|`|CvFajKPUaa	Mold is the responsibility of the landlord.  It is a very serious matter that must be addressed ASAP.  Mold, some kinds that is, can be very dangerous.  It can cause all sorts of breathing problems and is extremely dangerous for the young and old.  <br>  <br>  Tell your landlord immediately.  They are required by law to fix the issue as soon as learning about it.  The landlord is also responsible to take care of your housing needs while the mold is being dealt with.  Sometimes this means evacuating the residence while all the baseboards and dry wall is removed and the structure treated.<br>  <br>  If your landlord is a good one they will get on the issue immediately and without complaint.  If they resist they can face a magnitude of legal fines and you can sue them if any medical issues arise that can be attributed to the mold.

Take it down and take it to Lowe's or Home Depot with you.  Ask someone to help you find the correct replacement.<br>  <br>  If you hire an electrician figure their hourly rate at $75-$100 an hour.  It will only take a few minutes for them to do the actual work but most electricians have a minimum of $40-$80 to come out regardless how quick and easy the fix is.<br>  <br>  So, I would guess that your looking at $80-$150, possibly more to have an electrician do the work.  Or, you could do it for the cost of the replacement fan/light.  There are just 3 wires and a couple of screws.  You could do it in 10 minutes and a run to Home Depot.|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	You could do this yourself if it's the same size.

The manufacturers carefully hedge this one by saying someone Amish made the wooden cabinet, but reports are that even the wood on these heaters is very shoddy.  The heater itself is made in China.  I think if you investigate this you will find no Amish person would ever own one, and they are a marketing scam.<br>  <br>  Besides, electric heat is not an inexpensive form of heat, and the cheapest 1500 watt electric heater puts out every bit as much heat as the most expensive 1500 watt electric heater.  These heaters typically cost about 16 cents an hour to run, based on a national average of about 10.7 cents per killowatt hour.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	Its just a gimmick.  Its nothing special.  It only use full as a supplemental heater to put in your living room so that you can turn down the heat in the rest of your house. The same thing any space heater you can buy at Lowe's or home depot can do.
XWwZwHjWaa	I think the colors you have chosen work well together(think of a grapevine) but I am wondering if it will be too dark. I think you need some creams or pinks to lighten it up on the walls. ( I am thinking the comforter and curtains and maybe carpet or throw rugs will be plum/sage colors, so I think the wall needs lighter, neutral tones.<br>  I think it will be really elegant, the way you describe it.|`|051a951539f4262540d3c7ba8903b5abaa	This sounds great! In the event that your chairs don't work out, you can always re-upholster them.|`|b7ubYxxvaa	to me i dont think green and purple really go together but if you do then go for it|`|XzLUA7ataa	The colors are good choices, but much will depend upon the intensity of the hues and the textures that are used.  Kitchen stencils of grapes may have a vintage look, but can look interesting with the curtains you have chosen.  It sounds as if the color theme will flow from room to room giving a cohesive look to your decor.  Enjoy your new theme!|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Unlike Beachbabe, I think purple and green compliment each other very well. The only advise I might give you is not to put too much into a theme. Most of us get tired of themes very quicky and want to change it. i.e. me right now. (-:  Have fun with it.
7QtY1cSmaa	Water passing through the bricks carries dissolved salts, either from the mortar or perhaps from the soil. When the water evaporates from the surface of the bricks, the salts are left behind as a white deposit on the surface of the bricks.<br>  <br>  This can be removed with a stiff bristle brush or a wire brush. If it is difficult to remove or is very unsightly you can use masonry cleaner, which contains acid, to dissolve the deposits.|`|xRTjy9xIaa	they are all taking rubbish. bricks are meant to be covered until they are laid. if they get wet before u lay them some will run from back to front. its the chemical the bricks are made with. i laid more bricks than i care to remember, brickie for 30 years.|`|AA11808995	Its the lime coming out of the new Bricks which is usual in Frosty weather this will dry out and when the sun shines again it will dissapear it is quite normal.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	You may not of mixed the mortar correctly and now when it gets wet it washes down the bricks. You cant probably find a sealant at your local hardware store.|`|1uCaHWaoaa	It is called Efforescence and is primarily an appearance problem that occurs with masonry and often plaster. Rarely do these deposits of crystalline salts do any harm to masonry surfaces. In most cases, the efflorescence appears as a white dust or deposit on the surface of brick walls, chimneys or patio bricks. In certain cases, the color of these salts can also be green and brown. While it's difficult to control, efflorescence can be prevented by reducing moisture sources.<br>  I suggest doing so reserch on this subject then possibly putting a sealer on the bricks. You may be able to clean the brick using tide detergent first.|`|YsiuHeataa	This is caused by natural salts in the soil and enviorment as far as i know there is no prevention due to natural resources|`|bxlYleZkaa	I agree with what Billiam has already said. The face of the bricks is likely to decay in time due to the continuous extrusion of these salts.|`|xdF08Uqfaa	sounds like too much lime in the concrete.
ce415442d6934a8dae96b77ac250825faa	No, the bamboo plant won't die just by cutting off a shoot ...because it will produce new growth.<br>  <br>  If you are trying to eradicate it, here's how to do it:  <br>  "Its many horizontal rootstocks are close to the surface. All pieces of the shoots and rootstocks should be removed or regrowth will occur. <br>  Cutting bamboo shoots close to the ground, then removing the regrowth each time it reaches 20 to 24 inches in height will eventually kill established plants. Success with this method depends on exhausting the food reserves stored in the roots. The prompt removal of the shoots as they reach 20 to 24 inches is essential It will have to be performed many times over a period of a year or more."<br>  <a href="http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/plantanswers/trees/bamboo.html" rel="nofollow">http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/plant...</a>

Now for the cartridge; You want to line the hole in the washer to the area on the bottom of the cartridge that is flat (does not have a hole in it).

Cork continues to be a great player...its semi-impermeable to surface liquids so if you have minor water-related accidents, they shouldn't be a problem if you do a quick clean up.|`|dfd7612024263bc3cfb76c6f94dac807aa	The color and texture of the neighboring lino should help answer this question, as well as the tone of the other rooms with this flooring.  <br>  <br>  I love the new generation of lino - not your Mother's linoleum!  This stuff is tough, resiliant and beautiful.  You can even cut this stuff into creative patterns or designs.  And it's fairly inexpensive compared to your other two options.<br>  <br>  Bamboo can be tricky matching the coloring and cork is still pricey, but WONDERFUL underfoot.  If you're on your feet cooking up gourmet meals, I'd suggest the cork.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision!

cbe18130bd791393cb5460d5d3e15b4eaa	If you are are contemplating a career as a "flipper"<br>  <br>  Before starting anything...Do your research!<br>  <br>  1. Go to Amazon (or any other place you can buy books) & buy at least two different books on flipping houses & read them both cover to cover. Then you will know more about what you're actually getting yourself in to.<br>  <br>  2. Join a local real estate group that focusus on investing/flipping houses.<br>  <br>  3. Watch any & all remodeling, home staging and repair shows on tv, (including flip that house, flip this house & property ladder)<br>  <br>  4. Go look at fixers. Call up the agent & request a showing. Take a notepad & make notes about what you would do. Take a camera even, & take photos. Then, let another "flipper" buy the property. When the house goes back onto the market, go look at it again. Did that person make the same repairs you would? Take more pictures. Compare them. Know your market!<br>  <br>  Before starting on a venture like this....make sure this is what you want to and can do. You have to know your market, where your money is going to come from, have a good agent and be prepared for one hell of a ride!<br>  <br>  I would personally suggest a minimum of 3 months of studying & getting all your ducks in a row before attempting anything.<br>  <br>  But in the end...it will all pay off!

He made a ton on most of the houses and lost most of it all on the last one.<br>  <br>  The market went bad and he lost his shirt. I learned from watching him that it is a lot of work. You find many things that are bad that you didn't have the knowledge to see before you bought.<br>  <br>  Still he made money because he did almost all the work himself. He was semi-retired by then and had the time. If he quite his job to do it, he would have lost a lot of income.<br>  <br>  I know from him and from a friend that this is not a job for those who don't know what they are doing. If you don't do a lot of it yourself, it will cost you a fortune to rebuilt some of these houses. Way more than you can sell them for.<br>  <br>  Some people get lucky and make a lot of money. Some loose a lot of money.<br>  <br>  As an example, I bought an item at an auction for $2. I immediately put it on Ebay and got $250. No one at the auction knew what it was, except me.

I spoke to her about moving on in about a year... my agent says we have made $150K (CAN) (about $65.00 US... hehehe) so far and growing much more when the outside is done... problem?... I did a job like I would do on my own house (ummm 'cause it is...) and now she doesn't want to sell it... oh well... do I sell her with the house (her idea) or keep this one, find another and not let her live there?...

SOME of the trials and tribulations are real, some are not mentioned... the pricing they quote on the makeover shows is hilarious... figure, a 3 bedroom makeover for $35.00 in paint?... 3 colours?... ceiling paint?... trim paint?... I am guessing more like $200 in paint minimum... reupholstery $49.00... where, how? from Walmart with a staple gun?! What the heck?!...you can't believe everything but it sells the show, gets the audience and gives guys like me ideas.

e36bcd7f45f132e8833b6f65649c3f42aa	That smell is decomposition. <br>  <br>  Try to avoid using chemicals!<br>  <br>  You really need to clean it out.  Get one of those pool cleaner things on a pole, and start scooping. It's nasty, stinky work.  <br>  <br>  If you really want to be earth friendly, take the gunk you've scooped and turn it under the soil in your garden. Your plants will be estatic about that decision this summer.<br>  <br>  Make sure your filter is clean, and then start the pump up.  You'll have to clean the filter out a lot. <br>  <br>  And that's just the beginning! :)  If you have algae, that's a whole different battle but I'd leave it alone until the water stops smelling funky, because it actually feeds on the stuff that makes the water smell funky. <br>  <br>  First get it to smell nice, then work on getting it to look nice.<br>  <br>  Try hanging out in rec.ponds (search on it) - they'll have you loving your pond in no time.|`|crjosNQyaa	well sorry but you will have to clean it out of the dirty water and the leaves. once it is empty you will need to scrub it out using just water. Get a good filter system and good pump one that will be big enough to move the water at a good pace. The waterfall will need to be cleaned up too if it has any icky stuff growing on it too. fill the pond back up and let it circulate a few days before you decide to put any fish in it, if you are going too. If there are any close trees to the pond trim them back as so the leaves aren't falling into the pond. If you have too periodically use a skimmer net to remove the leaves and any other debris.  Good Luck and Enjoy!!!!!!!!!|`|4c4ce5d4561bed9d6f96f9d290c344ebaa	the reason the water smells is because it is stagnant.first you want to clean out any leaves and remove any algea that has formed.keep the water moving,that is what the waterfall probably was intended for.if you are not gonna have any fish or plant you can add some chemacals that will clear it up.good luck and check out a local garden supply for ideas on a water garden.some of your concerns may be answered there.|`|800b9fa42a93e2ce74f58fe1f55ad6c9aa	Take the leaves out and change the water.|`|u6DUxrXEaa	they are right, you have to clean it. A healthy pond has moving water, plants, and living things in it.<br>   first really clean the pond out, if it is a really large pond you may want to hire someone to do it, if it is something you can do yourself, put on some clothing you don't mind ruining, and dig in.<br>   You may have to adjust the water filter or pump that you use. It may not be big enough for the pond you are using. I recommend putting in some plants, and some fish. I also recommend that you get a bunch of snails, the snails really do a great job of cleaning. <br>   In the future, you will need to keep the leaves from building up in the pond. some light netting might help, and trimming back some of the trees. You have to keep taking care of the pond.<br>   A pond is a beautiful thing when everything works right. They are not that much work, but they can't be ignored. Check with local landscaping shops, they will have some of the things you need. If you plan on putting in fish, you want to make sure you don't use anything that will hurt them long term.
AA11305474	I collect all kinds of masks and hang them as art on my mask collection wall.  When the masks dont have holes in the sides and ribbons through them, I use the eye holes to feed fishing wire through and then drill a hole in the wall, insert a scew and wind the fishing wire around that.  Your masks sound large, so use fishing wire that is strong, I use 10 pound test but you might need something that can support more weight than that.  Also, you should probably use an anchor molly if you are screwing directly into drywall and not into a stud for added strength.|`|AA10794809	Don't add hardware. Buy a hanging bracket or mini-shelf.

Tl53m0fBaa	Heating plastic is usually the best way to make it pliable.<br>  <br>  From the sounds of your situation, you may be better off  buying a replacement part as heating the plastic and attempting to ben it could compromise its integrity.|`|Nk0J93dVaa	You can use a heat gun to heat it up and reshape it to your need. Keep the flow of heat moving around and do not focus it in one place too long. Plastics get overheated rather quickly so dont be afraid to cool an area and retry. As soon as you get it pliable (use gloves because if hot plastic sticks to your skin it could be devastating) shape it to your need and gently spray it with cool water to cool it and allow it to retain the shape. Often you have to exaggerate the shape (over shape) so that when it attempts to relax it will be right where you want it. The whole process depends on the type of plastic, how much heat and your skill at shaping it. Keep the heat gun away from the water or else a whole other type of devastation can occur.Perhaps something as simple as a fender washer will provide you with the needed ability to retain the torn portion in the proper place.<br>   Be safe and Good Luck!|`|51Sw4oo5aa	If you don't have a real heat gun, you can get near the same effect out of a hair dryer...altho it will get hot and trip its internal safety sooner...but still you should be able to get it done.

If you don't know what amperage rating should be there, you or an electrician might need to check the size of the wiring on the circuit to determine what it should be.  <br>  <br>  At best you might just need to put in the correct rated fuse, or reduce the load on that circuit by plugging something into a different outlet.   At worst you'll need to add a new circuit out to the main service entrance (unlikely unless you're living in an ancient house).    <br>  <br>  Temporarily, if you have a 20 amp extension, you could try plugging the refrigerator into another outlet.  Check the plugs for overheating after the unit has been running for a few minutes - don't leave home without doing this if you use this latter suggestion!|`|AA10410027	Take an extension cord and plug the fridge into an outlet in the other room and if it still blows the breaker, you have a short in the fridge someplace, usually underneath where wires<br>  can come in contact with some water, etc.<br>  If it doesnt blow, then you have a house wiring problem and may just be a weak circuit breaker. If everything there runs on <br>  220V, forget what I have said and call somebody that knows what they are doing.

How old is it? If it is old then maybe you'll just have to replace it. It could be faulty - water/moisture might be dripping onto the wiring connections.<br>  When you say blow the fuse -do you mean in the consumer unit? Only I'm an electrician and I've just been to Australia and I never saw any fuses in the plugs like we have in the UK.<br>  Try putting it on a different circuit by using an extension lead and see if that has the desired effect. I doubt it but it may be worth a try. <br>  As I said at the beginning my guess is that it is the fridge/freezer.<br>  Best of luck.

AA12139345	Well, if you're not going to use it very often, you may just want to get a used one from a flea market, Craig's list, eBay, etc.<br>  <br>  Most nail guns operate in the 70 to 120 psi range, though a few of the smaller brad nailers will operate on as little as 60 psi.<br>  <br>  Your lawn mower tires are probably less than 50 psi.<br>  <br>  CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) is an important measurement when looking at using air ratchets, paint and texture sprayers, impact guns, etc, as these tools require a constant supply of air, at a minimum pressure.  If you're going to use these kinds of tools, or hope to,  then you need to look at the requirements of the particular tool you want, and get a compressor that will do more than that.  Most palm sanders, for example, will need about 8 to 10 cfm @ 90 psi.  If you intended to use 2 of them at the same time, your compressor would need to be able to deliver about 20 cfm @ 90 psi.  How many gallons the tank will hold doesn't tell you this, so don't be misled by thinking a 'bigger tank' means it will put out more cfm.<br>  <br>  I carry a 2.5 gallon compressor around that will put many 5 gallon compressors to shame, hehehe.<br>  <br>  Take your time shopping for a compressor... get a good idea of what tools you want to use, and their requirements.<br>  <br>  Have Fun|`|B4O3f8w6aa	Tank size is important when purchasing. For tires and a nailer, even a 2 gallon tank will work. Blowing out the sprinklers is a once a year chore and you could probably still get by with a small tank. For tools that run more than a couple minutes, I would suggest at least a 10 gallon tank.|`|vODvzRx9aa	Suggestion:  Rule of thumb is to get a compressor that is the smallest you can, that will efficiently do the work.  A compressor that is too big won't do the job, will use too much energy, and could damage your belongings.  |`|1yWdvMrBaa	15-40 gallon between 90-150 psi between 2-5 horsepower<br>  <br>  I have a 30 gallon @ 150 psi and it will run all my air tools etc.<br>  It's a little noisy though.|`|v3xEtuLLaa	Look for a compressor that is rated for at least 5 SCFM (standard cubic feet per minute) at 90 p.s.i.  This is a much more important specification than HP.  This is the amount of air that the compressor can move at a given pressure.  Each tool that you may use has a minimum rating, and you will want to make sure that the compressor can handle it.  Hope this helps.

iaQSCKKUaa	Most saws with reputable names will work if you maintain the accuracy.  My preference is DeWalt only because there is a DeWalt store nearby (and I don't have to deal with Home Despot for things like crown stops, etc.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, all saws are good, laser or not, but consider moreover the blade you purchase. Especially in fine carpentry, melamine, trim, etc.  A $ 25 cross cut blade on a $ 800 saw does worse than a $100 blade on a BD 10" saw.  Again, only if it is accurately aligned.|`|c4999086fee89f42c2ecc09a87b3405faa	I have the ridgid and compairing it to the others I beleive it to be the best.

The accuracy of the cuts is great, and it required 0, I said 0, set-up out of the box.  I checked the plumb, square, and miter and angle settings, and everything I checked was dead on.  I checked some of the other saws at a few trade shows and found every one to need "a bit of adjustment" before I could get true and repeatable cuts.  I sprung for a fine blade to add to the blade that came with it and was then able to cut stock as small as 1/4" dowel and 3/8" quarter-round.  I also used it to cut dimensional pressure-treated lumber for a large play-scape, and it performed excellently there, too.|`|4jprxLEaaa	I bought a Delta last winter with the laser sight for my personal use.<br>  <br>  Once I zeroed the laser, I've had very good luck with it and have been very pleased.<br>  <br>  My only complaint is that I miss the quick release from my portable stand that my DeWalt has at work.|`|WiCfszv9aa	Next to the Dewalt, I would say Hitachi is the second best.

XpkhUBkGaa	This is a pretty common problem and is normally caused by the drain hose being pushed too far into the stand pipe and the end of the hose is submerged thereby creating a vacuum. The first time the machine fills, there is no vacuum but when it drains and spins, a vacuum is created and when it starts filling, the water is literally "sucked" out of the machine. Try pulling the hose up until it is only about 4 or 5 inches into the stand pipe. The other scenerio would be if you had your drain hose laying on the ground or put into a floor drain. In this case it would gravity drain but that should happen with the first fill as well. Hope this helps.....|`|EHLhO0RCaa	Faulty sensor that can be fix without a replacement part.

PIfRAalKaa	How and Why is Insulation Used to Control Sound? <br>  Sound attenuation, or the limiting of sound propagation from one area to another, requires the application of special and standard insulation materials to encase or enclose the noise generating source, forming a sound barrier between the source and the surrounding area. <br>  <br>  <br>  The higher the R factor the more noise reduction so 3 1/2 inch fiberglass is a R-11 and spray foam has a R- rating of 7.7 per inch. Also dense Styrofoam has a higher rating than fiberglass. (Foam,R-26.95 for 3 1/2 in)
