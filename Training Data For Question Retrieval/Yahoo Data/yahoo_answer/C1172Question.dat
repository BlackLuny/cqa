20090227113148AAVAcWD	Beauty & Style;Hair	Need suggestions for a good hair product?	I'm in search of a good hair product that will make my hair more manageable/smooth and protect it from heat styling without changing its natural texture too much.  Most products I've tried will change my hair texture and make my Chi straightener get "caught" in one spot while I'm moving it down my hair and it creates little crimps that are damn near impossible to get rid of. So I typically stay away from most mousses and gels. I've been using TiGi's BedHead After Party for several years and while I love applying it when my hair's dry, it just doesn't do the trick when it's wet. Anyone have any good suggestions?    By the way, my hair's natural texture is very fine but there's a LOT of it! So in a way my hair's thick and thin at the same time. And it's wavy although I normally straighten the crap out of it. (if that helps)

Hey all, I was just wondering if by any chance I could go from a very dark brown (which kinda looks like black, but isn't) to a shade of brown that is...say, 2 shades lighter than my current one. I am planning to do all this at home because I am a foreign student who can't afford salons in South East England, haha :) I was thinking that this dark color kinda makes my face look dark because I have a fair skin tone and blue eyes.      Thanks:)
20090227121355AAr3T8c	Beauty & Style;Hair	Hair Color Disaster! Can You Help?	Okay..So, I started with my natural hair color (medium golden brown with red under tones). Then I bleached my hair (please don't ask...I'm pleading temporary insanity. lol). After the bleaching process...my hair was pale yellow at the roots and the rest was a light reddish orange! I left the bleach on for 90 minutes (max time allowed). Next, I put on a toner (suggested by a lady at Sally's). The toner I used was...Wella Color Charm T18 White Lady. The result was a lighter orangey red. At that point, I figured I'd go back to a darker color...so I added L'Oreals Rich Mahogany (I know...BIG MISTAKE!). My hair turned crayon red!!!! So, I added Garnier Nutrisse 53 Chestnut (medium golden brown). I thought that by adding a neutral brown...I'd be toning down the red. I couldn't have been more wrong! My hair is now the brightest darkest shade of red I have ever seen or could possibly imagine! It's brighter than the Judd's, Lucy, Reba, etc. Please help...what can I do in order to get rid of the extreme red and get back to the brown side!? ****Note: The 4 processes listed above were all done in a 24 hr. time frame. Needless to say, I'm expecting my hair to fall out. lmao

I heard that for people with round faces who want short hair, shags are good since they are a layered, messy look that looks good for round faces.

So I bought a pair of Rainbows last week, but I bought the men's. I guess I'm used to wearing Old Navy flip-flops and used to the wide feeling, because when I tried the women's sizes on it felt kinda narrow.       But then, after awhile I noticed that the men's looked kinda weird when I wear them with shorts or a skirt.       Haven't really worn them yet, so I dunno if I should go exchange them for women's. Plus the pair I got are a bit big.       So yeah. I seriously need some feedback here.

I'm currently at 5/8" and I'm trying to push to 11/16" but the stretch is very painful. Much more than normal. I've tried multiple times but to no avail. I've had the 5/8" holes for 3+ months now. I've lubricated the taper with vaseline (i know, tisk tisk), vitamin E oil, and regular soap. I've successfully gotten the tapers through on multiple occasions but never left any jewelry in because on the backside of my ear the skin had followed the jewelry to back and out of my ear hole. I don't know how to move up. I've considered Kaos software, but stretching with those can cause problems that I just don't want to deal with. I REALLY don't want to scalpel either. Any advice?
