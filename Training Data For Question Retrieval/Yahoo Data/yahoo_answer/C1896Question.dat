20090226100247AA7JFhN	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	How do I change my internet explorer font? From unicode (utf-8) to Western European (windows)?	So just recently my font has changed on my browser and its way too small but only on certain pages like google.com. When i click on the view tab my text size is 100% so then i click the view tab again and go to encoding and the option that is clicked is unicode (utf-8). So then I click the same encoding and switch it to Western European (Windows) and that fixes all my problems. However when i refresh the page or view another page is goes back to that same option of unicode (utf-8) and its small all over again! how do i fix this stupid annoying problem?

20090226100320AAsFF95	Computers & Internet;Security	Virus Question ... PLEASE assist.?	I was trying to download the instrumental to this song for a funeral of one of my family members and after I downloaded it (off LIMEWIRE which I now regret) my computer says I have a virus.       Facts:   The virus is called TrojanBrisvA.   I have Norton Anti-Virus (which didnt scan the thing I downloaded before, what a great help) and they instructed me to download this thing called "FixBrisvA" and that it would take it off my computer. I ran the scan about three times, since they said the virus had shown up three times. I ran a scan after running the program and now it is saying that the virus has come back. I deleted the files that I downloaded from Limewire and I used the program that they told me to.       What do I do to fix this issue? My computer has been running slowly also.       Thanks for all of your help

I work at a small business, and we've recently added a fifth workstation to our network, and I'm responsible for making tech things work,      We've run into a problem! Our linksys wireless router only has four ports!  Typically, this would be an easy problem to solve by buying a switch - however, we also have several laptops and a printer that is connected wireless, and all of these machines need to be able to share files and access the printer through the network - a switch would complicate this largely, as it the machines on the switch would not be on the same "tier" of the network as the wireless machines             What's the solution?  I'm not great with networking - not taking my cisco course this semester      Thanks in advance for the help!

I ran adaware and my norton several times, every time it picks up stuff but it never goes completely away. Here are some of the other symptoms I am having:   -Creating multiple system restore points (1 every day)   -Can't restore to an earlier setting   -High CPU usage even in safe mode   -All of my windows services are not working - I tried to get online to update my virus software and there are no internet connections listed, then a window pops up and tells me my windows networking service folder is unavailable. I tried to install a new virus protection software and it says that my windows installer service is unavailable. Sound doesn't work either.      So I need some serious help, I feel like if I can get the windows installer to work I can get a stronger virus protection on there and clean most of it out. I don't want to reinstall windows because I have photoshop on this machine, but no install discs (no i didn't steal it, they were damaged in a fire).      Any ideas?

20090226103750AA6aySp	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Playing DVDs on a Netbook?	Just so everyone's on the same page: I am talking about the $300-$500 range netbooks (Acer Aspire .ect).  None of them have DVD/CD drives.      Now, I know I can easily get an external USB DVD drive for roughly $60, but would the netbook have sufficient processor power and graphics to play them?  In theory, it should work, but I have had nothing but problems with (mostly older) laptops and playing DVDs.      I'm not sure how large a part the processor has in playing a DVD, but I imagine it would be the primary component involved.  With an Intel Atom 1.60 ghz, I would be a little concerned.      Most of the netbooks have an Intel? Graphics Media Accelerator 950 which I'm not really sure about either.      And lastly, if there's a good chance it wouldn't be able to handle playing a DVD, would it even be able to play videos off the hard drive?      Theories are helpful, but hard facts would be nice =).      Any help would be appreciated,   -Mark

20090226111047AA1yQcb	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Which computers are right for me?	I am looking to buy a new computer. I don't want something very expensive, I'm aware that computers need to be replaced every few years because it wears down and speed isn't the same after a few years. I am willing to buy a computer somewhere from $500-700.       All I want in the computer is for it to be fast, have lots of RAM, have lots of storage space. Have CD/DVD-RW. And.. well just be good at multi-tasking. I use the computer mainly for entertainment, music, movies, browsing but I also use Word and other programs. Most times I'm doing several of those things at the same time, downloading while listening to music while wanting to browse the web but my current computer stresses me out because it keeps freezing for any new thing I want to open.       So bottom line, I don't really care for pc gaming or anything like that. Just the usual browsing, downloading and burning. Oh by the way, I recently learned about built in wifi. I am very interested in this, I have an xbox 360 and it is a pain having to move the modem from the computer to the xbox. If a computer with built in wifi can fix this then I want that too. What are some good computers with these features?   I've seen some in Best Buy from HP. Any recommendations?       PS   If you're wondering the pain I go through with this computer I'll tell you! Bought it in 2001. It has 1.5 ghz. Only 20gb hard drive. and a pathetic 128mb RAM. It's still alive and running. (or walking). It's a Gateway. But yeah, time for a new one!
20090226105759AAuw41y	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Can you really replace the 11.1 V battery with a 14.8 V battery in a Gateway laptop?	I'm looking for a replacement battery for my MX8738. The battery is labeled "6MSBG" and 11.1 V @ 4800 mAh (3UR18650F-2QC-MA1). I am finding some 6MSBG batteries with that same number, same ratings, no problem.      But - I am also finding batteries that are labeled 6MSBG, and are said to be compatible, but which are 14.8 V @ 6600 mAh (12 cells). They're advertised as having much longer life.      Now, from what I remember about electronics, you can increase battery wattage (current) with no problem - the device will only pull as much current as it needs.  But if you increase Voltage, things tend to go "pop" and let the magic smoke get out.      Is a 14.8 V battery really an acceptable replacement for the 11.1 V battery the laptop came with? Is it worth double the money to get longer battery life?      Any advice about purchasing a replacement laptop battery will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

It stops when I plug in some headphones and they work fine but when there is no headphones the sound pauses every second because of this non existent audio device keeps being plugged in and unplugged every second. I have tried the audio device settings from control panel but can only get the microphone and speaker settings. Their is nothing about headphones.

My music collection is in a lossless format but when I send audio across the internet I encode to 192kbps MP3. Here`s my question: When encoding a source file in this case Wave sound to MP3 192Kbps - an output file is created, this file contains the encoded audio, the source file remains in it`s original location still stating the file as lossless!. Does the source file suffer any compression during the encoding process? Or does the encoding program simply create a duplicate file while still retaining the source file`s lossless data?      Appreciate some help with this one.

20090226115835AAgtnjF	Computers & Internet;Software	For a low-end machine, KDE or Gnome?	Hi.      I was using KDE for the past 6 years, and got very used to it. However, it was always installed on pretty high-end machines.      My work computer, however, is very slow (P3 800mhz, 128megs ram). Yesterday, I was stupid enough to give KDE 4 a shot. Didn't run any faster than vista would.      So what I'll do is tonight I'll do a GRP install of Gentoo. What im not sure of is whether I should go with KDE 3.x or gnome?      I would highly prefer NOT to use gnome, since im not used to it and i dont like it.      The answer to this question IS kinda obvious. I am a web developer, and all the software that I used is KDE-based (Quanta, etc). It wouldn't make too much sense to have Gnome and kdelibs running at the same time on 128 megs of ram.   However, still wanna get some advice. Cuz as far as i know, gnome is a lot more lightweight than KDE. would gnome be a better option for that machine?      thanks

I noted that it as a problem running newer games smoothly for ex The Witcher: Enhanced Edition. I have Vista 64   with ATI Catalyst and I guess drivers are not enough so I was wondering what video card should I get that will keep me set for awhile. I don't want anything way too expensive, just a little over enough. Its powered with AMD Truion 64 x2 and a 2GB core. I was thinking of just getting a XPS but after adding what I wanted online(about $2,000+) I think I'm just better off changing parts out for mine. So any suggestions will be great! Thanks!

Awhile back I bought a Dell notebook and a Dell All In One printer. Since then I have gotten rid of the Dell notebook and bought a HP one. I still use the Dell Printer, and it has worked fine for printer. Recently I tried to scan something to my computer and it is not working. I realized this is probably because the original printer software CD was not installed. When I tried to do so, it won't let me since my notebook is not a Dell (the software was already on the original Dell notebook). So what are my options now? Am I stuck with just a printer that can't scan due to the fact that it is a Dell. Any ideas on how I could get this to work?

20090226150524AAbnEuO	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	How does one find all the relevant stats about your computer, i.e. Make, Model, Operating System, Processor?	I'm speaking with an 11-year old computer Newbie many miles away over the phone who can't tell me all the relevant data about their computer system which would allow me to purchase or recommend upgrades to hardware / software.  They have a desktop PC and the O/S is Windows, but we don't even know which version yet.      There is a place one can go within the software (I believe Windows or possibly DOS) that will give a complete readout of the relevant stats, i.e. size of the Hard Drive, amount of RAM, Processor name/speed/version, presence of sound card, video card, accelerators, peripherals, etc.      I'm not looking for the child to find some of this listed on the back of the desktop in tiny, tiny print.  I'm asking where they might find this data withing the computer programming and how to navigate to get there.  I don't know the age of the computer but I'm guessing it is over 3 years old...maybe even 5 years old or a little more.      Again, we don't even know which O/S they have but I'm guessing it is earlier than Windows Vista, XP, and possibly ME or 2000.  It may be Windows 98 or even earlier.  Again, we need to get them upgraded in various ways but I need to know what hardware and software we are starting with first.      How to instruct them in the procedure to navigate to that place in the computer's programming so they can read to me the specifics of their hardware and software over the phone?      Thank you!

This time & every subsequent time it comes up with the "blank disk dialog". The disk seems to be empty.      I'm sh*t-worried now. What happened? Any help or ideas/advice is much appreciated.

20090226154105AAUu3Uz	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Is it possible to make a notebook pc using desktop parts?	Alright, I cannot find a PC on the market with the spec's I need for a good price. So I went out and found the parts from resalers, and it come's to roughly 1800 for the basics. (Core i7, Corsair, Nvidia 9800 GTX+). Now, I have found similar specs in notebook pc's (Alienware, Dell, Sager, Falcon NW, etc.), but those rack up between four and ten thousand dollars. Definitely out of spending range. So, how would I go around making a notebook pc then? I do imagine I may need to make my own chassis, but is there any advice that can be given doing this?

20090225115342AAD6kBw	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Why does my Laptop get so SSSSLLLOOOOWWWW when I plug it in?	Yesterday when I began charging my laptop it got so slow I had to manually shut it down; I couldn't get to the f-ing restart button, the task manager took 5 frikin minutes to come up, and even when it did, it took another 5 minutes for each of the 4 applications I was using and 50% of the CPU. I was just about to win a 50 turn mario party game, too... you know how f-ing long that takes?! I waited 20 minutes just so I wouldn' have to loose the data, but it didn't improve AT ALL. I'll admit, I had stepmania open (which takes about 10,000k of ram and some fair amount of CPU i can't remember) and firefox, but the fourth "application" was just a folder. Everything was working fine until I plugged it in; stepmania was maximized right before, and when I tried to minimize it (which has never had any problems), the whole thing froze. I don't think I can do anything but plug it in after I close some applications, but is this normal for laptops, or do I just have a piece of sh1t compy? (its a dell with vista, so I'm pretty open to that possibility)

So i researched this on Google and someone said it was due to the malware bytes software? so is this the reason it will not install? Either way can someone please tell me off some other software to be used with this? I also downloaded Free AVG and this tells me to un-install malware bytes before i install it, do i need to do this? will they both not work, if i install them both??

I tried using Quicktime Pro to delete the audio track, but I'm forced to save the file as a .mov, which is not what I want.      I also tried exporting only the video, but the export reaches ~10% completion before hanging indefinitely. What I really want is to delete the audio completely while retaining the full quality of the original video file. Is this possible?      Thanks,   - Ben

20090226155357AAGTPrY	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Wireless networks help...?	Just a couple of questions if I need clearing up.   I have an old wanadoo livebox and have a  802.11g/b wireless connection to my PC. The USB adapter I am using is a Edimax something-or-other with a screw on aerial, and is 802.11G. I am with the ISP orange and have 2mb connection (I think(could be higher)). The livebox is only downstairs - the room right under mine- and sometimes the connection is good to O.K but it fluctuates wildly and most of the time it is poor with worse rates than dial-up. I have done numerous speed tests and it never exceeds 1mbs download speed.   I was wondering if anybody knows why this would be happening.   Also if I got a Netgear wirless-N USB adapter would it connect to my old router (livebox) and would it make a difference. As too would a repeater make and difference? and does any body know any good ones that would connect with the livebox.      Many Thanks as it is REALLY annoying me.   ...Ash...

20090226155700AARbipb	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	JAVA programming help!!!?	Using for loop, write a Java program which displays all leap year from 1900 to 2100. A year is leap year (and so contains February 29) if it is divisible by 4. But if the year is also divisible by 100 then it is not a leap year unless it is divisible by 400. This means that year such as 1992, 1996 are leap years because they are divisible by 4 and are not affected by the rest of the rule which applies to century years such as 1900 and 2000. Century years are not leap years except where they are multiple of 400. Hence, the years 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not leap years. But the year 2000 was a leap year, the first such century leap year since 1600.      (this is my homework for Java Programming but I need your help guys because my system crashed on me I really need your help.)

I've been looking to upgrade my RAM since I have 2GB, and I think it would run better with the games I have with 3 or 4 GB (Like flight simulator, Sims, or Mirrors Edge). But, since my computer has been having problems which I posted in a different question, I decided to check who the RAM manufacturer was while I had the case open on the computer, and btw I got mine from cyberpowerpc and had the "Major brand or Corsair" selected for RAM, I found out the label was AE, I looked them up, and they're a UK company where you buy with pounds (Although I guess they would ship to the U.S. too since it came with my computer) Do I need the same brand to upgrade, or will it affect performance if it is different? Would 3 or 4GB be more bang for the buck? And finally, will dual channel only work with 2 RAM sticks, or 4? Not 3?       Here's specs just in case you need to see:    Asus M2N SLI AM3 NForce 560   (It has up to 4 slots for RAM)   AMD X2 6000 AM2 CPU   Nvidia Geforce 9800GT 1GB VideoRam   (Only one, even though it is an SLI motherboard lol)   Windows Vista Home Premium SPI 32bit   320GB SATA II HD   600 Watt Power Supply
