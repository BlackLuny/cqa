20090128211151AAERK0S	News & Events;Current Events	Fellow Canadians Please?	It started with the removal of our national flag by Pearson.  It was replaced by an artificial national flag, meant to make us more 'Canadian'.  Should the Americans have replaced their Stars and Stripes to make themselves more 'American'?  Should the Australians have replaced their national flag to make themselves more 'Australian'?  I don't think Pearson's idea about destroying the Red Ensign worked.      Then came the mass immigration, then came the removal of 'God Save The Queen', now we are removing 'O Canada' from schools!        This five-decade long process of de-patriotisation in Canada must stop!      My question is, fellow Canadians: is anyone besides me noticing all this happening?  Is anyone planning to do something reasonable about all this?      PS - If you are some American with a superiority complex about your own country, feel free to NOT answer this question.

I think I have an answer.  I believe that they are very scared of us because the human race has proven to be warlike beyond belief.  I think that they are worried that soon we will master the "antigravity technology" necessary to build flying disks as they have and be a "warlike force" in the Universe.

20090129010026AAlWSs5	News & Events;Current Events	What happened to Israel's auto-defense system? ?	Israel is known to have the world's most up to date and sophisticated weapons around. A few years ago we heard about a technology that is able to protect countries from rocket or missile attacks by launching suicide missiles that crashed into the incoming missile or rocket and saved the target. The United States bragged about having that technology and any technology that the states has obviously the Israelis have as well. So my question how are so many Hammas rockets making their way to Israel undetected? When Hezbollah attacked the Israeli government claimed the Hezbollah was firing in a way that the rockets could not be detected. The same cannot be said about Hammas because they never had any real trainning plus no one can tell them how bcause they are cut off from the world. I ask again how are the rockets making their way in?

ALL HOUSES NEED AT  LEAST ONE SECURITY GUARD LOOK AFTER THERE HOUSE/VALUEABLES IN THERE ABSENCE ,WHEN THEY GO FOR WORK OR OUTSIDE.    WHAT IF A GOOD NGO PROVIDES A SECURITY COVER TO EVERY HOME @ OF Rs150 EVERY MOUNTH [THAT IS Rs5 EVERYDAY TO DO THE SECURITY SERVICES/WATCH MAN HELP].     I THINK I MILLIONS HOMES IN TAMIL NADU/ANDHRA PRADESH/MUMBAI/DELHI WILL TAKE UP THE SERVICE OF SECURITY OFFERED IN THE STATE BY NGO'S OR RELIGIOUS COMMUNITYS.    HE IS PROVIDED 3 TIMES FOOD AND TEA AT THE WORK PLACE AND COMMON TOILET AT THE WORK PLACE IN APPARTMENTS/FACTORYS/SHOPS.    HOTEL PERSON AS TO INVEST JUST Rs30 /DAY AND THE TEA SHOP PERSON HAS TO INVEST JUST Rs20 AND BUILDING PEOPLE/FACTORY PEOPLE HAVE TO INVEST JUST Rs5/DAY ON HIM.  MORNING FOOD COST HIM Rs15,  AFTERNOON FOOD COSTS HIM Rs35,  NIGHT FOOD COSTS HIM Rs15.  so total on the food is RS65 AND TEA IS GIVIEN FREE OF COST AT THE WORK PLACE.     THE SO HIS FIRST SPONCER MAKE A PROFIT OF Rs5 ON HIM IN THE AFTERNOON MEAL WHICH COSTS HIM JUST Rs30 .    THE SECOND SPONCER TEA FELLOW MAKES Rs 5 to 7 IN THE MORNING AND NIGHT MEALS.    BUILDING OWNER GETS HIS JOB DONE COOL AT A PRICE OF Rs5/day.     SO HOTEL FELLOW MAKES A COOL PROFIT OF Rs150 MOUNTH AND TEA SHOP FELLOW MAKES A COOL PROFIT OF Rs150/MOUNTH.     SO BOTH  EMPLOYEING 1 LAKH PEOPLE WILL MAKE A PROFIT OF Rs 1,50,00,000 /MOUNTH WHICH IS IN CROES /MOUNTH. WHICH IS GOOD .SO WE MUST GO FOR IT.    WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT,  I THINK NGO'S/RELIGIOUS SECT MUST TAKE UP THIS WORK OR AT LEAST GOVT INSOME FORM IN LIKE POLITICAL PARTIES MUST TAKE IT UP TO SAVE ALL PEOPLE  FROM UNEMPLOYMENT ETC.

20090129023553AAq2Ev4	News & Events;Media & Journalism	How shocking is this story?	Four-year-old Darcey Iris Freeman died after her father allegedly took her out of the family car and threw her 58 metres off Melbourne's West Gate bridge in front of her two brothers.      She miraculously survived the plunge into the Yarra river, but died from her terrible injuries in the Royal Children's Hospital several hours later.      Horrified witnesses on the busy gateway called triple zero around 9.10am (AEDT) on Thursday, and water police took just 10 minutes to reach Darcey and pull her from the water near the pumping station at Spotswood, not far from the bridge.      Paramedics then worked frantically for 50 minutes to stabilise her, before she was flown by helicopter to the hospital where doctors tried to perform a miracle. But Darcey was pronounced dead at 1.35pm.      Detective Inspector Steve Clark, from the Victoria Police homicide squad, told reporters it appeared no witnesses had an opportunity to intervene during the incident.      "It's all happened fairly quickly, as I understand it, nobody had the opportunity," Det Insp Clark said.      "He's got straight out of the car, taken the young girl and walked to the edge of the bridge."      The incident shocked police and paramedics called to the scene.      "This is a dreadful set of circumstances and often you think you've seen it all, but you haven't," Det Insp Clark said.      Her father, 35-year-old Arthur Freeman, was arrested about 10.30am after he was spotted with the two other children walking around the Commonwealth Law Courts in central Melbourne "visibly distressed," with the Landcruiser parked outside.      Police took him into custody peacefully. As he was being led away, her reportedly begged court staff to "take care of my kids".      "He was pretty down and he had the two other children with him and he tried to enter the court. He couldn't talk to anyone, he wouldn't talk to anyone, he was just a mess," witness Vince Mascia told the Nine Network.      "They realised something was wrong and called the police."      Freeman, of Hawthorn, was charged with Darcey's murder, but did not appear in the Melbourne Magistrates Court for a filing hearing later because he was deemed suicidal and unfit to be interviewed by police.      He has been remanded in custody and will next appear in court on May 21 for a committal mention.      Det Insp Clark said the incident was "particularly distressing" for family members and witnesses.      Premier John Brumby described the incident as "a terrible tragedy".      "It's such an awful ... horrible thing to happen to the child," he told reporters.      But Mr Brumby said it was far too early to think about bringing forward efforts to upgrade security on the bridge.      "So to be honest, people probably aren't thinking about those things, they're just thinking - they're feeling for the family and how this could have occurred," he said            Pictures are here:    http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/7349...

20090129034354AAUuL2Q	News & Events;Current Events	Plz people i need advice ?	had an accident about 3 weeks ago and it was not my fault. I was hit from the rear. Ever since then i have had a sore lower back, left butt cheek and pain shooting straight to my ankle which in turn has made my lower part of the ankle and last three toes slightly numb and tingly. I have been going to chiro for the past couple of weeks and see no improvement. I had X rays which said i have mild scoliosis (which is obviously not from the accident) but also my pelvis is not aligned and the reason for my pain in my left but cheek to my ankle is from a nerve.. Some days i can not get out of bed and i have not been able to sit down or even drive a car i always have to lie flat so there is no pain. Its like a cramping feeling all the way down. Could this be from the accident ?? I do not have ANY history of any back problems and am healthy as a fiddle and this all started a day after the accident, but not as bad as what it is now. Do I have a case if i bring it towards my insurance company. I have also had about 2 weeks off week and am still off as i work in a call centre and my job is to sit down which i cant and also can not drive there. Please Help guys should i seek legal advice as this has already cost me alot in chiro bills etc.. also with the nerve damage, pelvis alignment and scoliosis is that likely to stay with me? not sure how i would go with making a compo claim as im scared this may haunt me in the future. Also im not sure with the scoliosis considering i have never had any back issues what so ever in my life and the accident has triggered it earlier, if they would take that into consideration and with the nerve i mean is there any way of telling whether it will ever come back??
