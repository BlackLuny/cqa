Spend a day of relaxing at your hotels pool, go to the beach, or take a nice walk through town.<br>  3. Don't eat out at fancy over priced restraunts, if you want to have a big meal, do it at dinner.

SR3qSPa5aa	Hola y he viajado en varios cruceros de hecho estube en St.Thomas la isla es bonita como toda isla caribena pero es carisima yo estube 2 anos atraz alla la movilizacion es carisima porque todo es turismo estas obligado a tomarla o de lo contrario no vas para ningun lado y te cobran 25 dolares por persona ida y vuelta pero como uno quiere conocer y bajarse en el centro cuando quieres regresar al barco tienes que pagar 25 dolares nuevamente en esa isla se nos quedo casi toda la plata que llevabamos ya que eramos 6 mi esposo e hijos , claro que en esos 25 te dan un tour por las partes mas turisticas y te llevan a un mirador donde podras ver la isla y es precioso y de ahi tambien podras ver la playa que dicen ellos es una de las 10 playas mejores del mundo lo cual a mi me parecio exajerado porqe hemos estado en otras que para mi juicio son mejores. Ahora en cuanto al Crucero cada lineas es diferente en la que yo he estado el Capitan no nos estaba recibiendo en la entrada del comedor , pero en todo caso lo pasaras bien y en caso que te marees le ocurrio a mi hijo ahi te dan unas pastillas para que se te quite tambien cuando te subes al crucero ahi  te tomaran una foto y te daran una targeta como de credito y esa es la que usaras para comprar cualquier subenir dentro del barco ahi no se usa dinero al contado solo se te permite usar esa tarjeta que tambien te sirve para entrar a tu camarote y tambien te sirve cuando bajas a las islas esa targeta es como tu pasaporte de regreso al barco porque cuando vas a entrar la van a scanear y va a parecer tu foto y asi es como te identificaras como pasajero ahora si la perdistes te van a cobrar 5 dolares por otra nueva y el proceso para entrar al barco sera mas largo por motivo de segurida , tambien tienes que tener cuidado de no perderla porque cualquiera puede usarla en el barco para comprar y cuando ya te vas del barco porque regresron es igual que un hotel tienes que chequearte y entregara la llave o en este caso la targeta que te dieron y ahi la scanearan y veran cuanto gastaste y te lo cobraran en tu targeta de credito la que usastes cuando comprastes el pasaje , tambien averiguate si en el pasaje va incluida la propina  esta te sale $ 60 dolares por persona que tambien te la cargaran cuando te  vayas nosotros como eramos 6 nos salio bastante caro la propina no se cobra por habitacion sino por persona que la ocupa , a veces va incluido en el pasaje nosotros no la quisimos incluir asi que la tubimos que pagar cuando se acabo el crucero , otra cosa que me olvidaba toda la comida es gratis puedes comer hasta que rebientes excepto por el alcohol eso va a parte y lo otro no se te ocurra comprar bevida en lata porque es carisima te sale como 6 dolares cada tarro , el barco tiene una variedad increible de jugos deliciosos asi que no hagas ni tal en tentarte con una bebida en lata porque para eso la puedes comprar cuando lleges a casa pero no asi los jugos deliciosos que ellos preparan . Espero que te haya servido mi comentario trate de decirte lo que las otras personas no te dijieron y que es importante que lo supieras . Oh!  El barco si se mueve pero eso depende de la marea y el viento para eso estan las pastillas pero a nosotros no paso un dia se movio bastante que te llegabas a ir para el lado claro que nunca tanto como para caerte pero tampoco fue todo el dia pero que se mueve se mueve y que se siente se siente .Que lo pases bien. Yo voy en otro en Agosto .|`|f866f858df3fd05cce23354ffb788d00aa	BUENIIIIIIISIMO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  es la palabra, para describir los cruceros. Yo me estoy preparando para mi octavo crucero (esta vez por los fiordos de Noruega, por 12 días, en el Norte de Europa). Si tu crucero es de 7 días: tendrás 2 noches de gala así es que llévate ropa de noche. La segunda noche de crucero es la primera noche de gala con un cocktail que ofrece el capitán; ésa noche, tendrás la oportunidad de tomarte una foto con el capitán, que recibe a todos los invitados en la puerta del salón y claro, la foto te la venderán en los días sub siguientes (la colocan en exhibición y si quieres la compras y si no, pues no). Hay unos programas diarios, con las actividades de todo el barco que te colocarán en la cabina todas las noches. Obviamente, el día que embarcas, podrías no tenerlo en la cabina (o puede que sí) de todas maneras, puedes encontrarlo en la recepción del barco. te recomiento que estudiés los planos del barco antes de abordar, para que ya sepas más o menos dónde está todo. Pídele en cualquier agencia de viajes un catálogo de Royal Caribeban y allí ubicas el barco y le sacas fotocopia ampliada a cada plano, para que sepas en que piso estará cada cosa. Todas las noches, tendrás un show diferente y si te gusta jugar, tendrás un casino. Una vez que regreses, ya no querrás otro tipo de vacaciones sino sólo cruceros. Hay una página, en la cual puedes encontrar compa?eros de crucero, para que los conozcas por internet y se encuentren a bordo. Busca en ww.infocruceros.com  Buen viaje!!!|`|kmRvPUHYaa	Es algo increíble dificil de describir... Ya tengo 3 cruceros y la verda te engancha... es un modo de ver las diferentes ciudades en una semana.  Tb depende con que compa?ía vas. Costa es una máquina de sacar dinero por todo hasta la bebida, pero los barcos tienen de lujo. Sin embargo Pullmantur no tiene  los barcos tan lujosos pero están en buen estado y lo mejor todo incluido. Y es una pasada!!!|`|AA10407990	Camila: Para celebrar nuestros 15 a?os de matrimonio, mi esposa y yo viajamos de Florida al caribe en el Voyager of the seas, el crucero más grande de esa línea.<br>  Todo estuvo de maravilla. Pasamos 5-6 días muy intensos, visitando lugares muy bellos, conociendo gente que también celebraba o que simplemente viajaba por placer. Este tipo de vacaciones te plantea posibilidades variadas, lo único que no puedes hacer es ?llegar tarde al barco! porque te dejan. Hay una cena con el capitán (formal) patinar, jugar basquetball, chatear, cine, boliche, nadar, apostar, bailar y hasta rappelear son actividades que puedes llevar a cabo durante la travesía.<br>  Hay un simulacro que es obligatorio y tendrás que seguir las instrucciones.<br>  El barco no te dará la sensación de movimiento, es tan grande que no percibes que se mueva.<br>  Las compras, como todo, puedes encontrar gangas y cosas caras, creo que antes de comprar, debes investigar en los puertos y si no tendrás la oportunidad de comprar de regreso al punto de partida.<br>  Es completamente diferente a los demás viajes, vale mucho la pena hacerlo.<br>  ?Que lo disfrutes!

Great scenery, mountains, glens,and rivers. It has Art Galleries, Museums, Castles, and a multitude of historic sites. There are great bars, pubs, clubs restaurants and nightlife all around Scotland.

It's very very very friendly, the people are very chatty and warm, sometimes annoyingly. It's a freezing city, just have a look at your map, it's on the north sea. Beautiful scenery and if you are quasi-medieval you will like it. All the bad areas are in the outskirts away from the areas around the city center (which are a kinda posh). <br>  <br>  In my case it's not the city that I like more when I visit it but the people 
5phcBjJ0aa	Allora, io sono stata una "exchange student" negli Stati Uniti per un anno. La mia esperienza è stata un pò atipica perché avevo 15 anni e mezzo alla partenza, perché non ci sono andata con i miei ma con un'ottima associazione che si occupa di questi scambi (www.intercultura.it) e ho vissuto in famiglia. Quindi le difficoltà che ho avuto non sono state legate esclusivamente alla cultura, ma anche al fatto che ero un'adolescente lontana dalla famiglia, che vivevo in una famiglia che (seppur meravigliosa) aveva abitudini diverse dalle mie, che dovevo andare a scuola come tutti gli americani della mia età, ecc...<br>  Ora, dal punto di vista esclusivamente pratico, una grande difficoltà che ho riscontrato è stata quella di vivere in una zona rurale dove i mezzi pubblici non esistevano e io non potevo guidare. Qui in Italia non vivo in città e i mezzi pubblici non sono efficientissimo, ma ci sono. Lì ero costretta a chiedere passaggi ai membri della famiglia, i quali avevano comunque le loro vite e non potevo aspettarmi un servizio taxi da parte loro. Probabilmente se avessi avuto la possibilità di essere più autonoma avrei anche avuto meno difficoltà nella mia vita sociale.<br>  Ad ogni modo credo che sia difficile trovare un tipo di difficoltà che riscontrano tutti gli italiani. Ad esempio, io dopo 3 mesi parlavo discretamente e capivo tutto, il cibo secondo me non è così cattivo come dicono tutti, il sistema sanitario fortunatamente non ho avuto modo di sperimentarlo (ad ogni modo ero coperta dall' assicurazione), ho conosciuto persone stupende con le quali sono legata tutt'ora che sono passati 10 anni.<br>  Credo che tutto dipenda dal modo con il quale ci si pone. Non ci si può aspettare di ritrovare le polpette al sugo di mamma o di venire accolti con tutti gli onori. Bisogna faticare per adattarsi, per imparare la lingua, per capire ed accettare la nuova cultura. Ma questo vale per tutti i paesi del mondo.|`|5jyRoEkeaa	Guarda secondo me dipende molto da dove negli Stati Uniti. Io vivo a New York da un anno e mezzo e posso dirti che qui non ti può mancare assolutamente nulla perché trovi proprio di tutto e di più. Chiaro, devi conoscere, sapere dove andare e a chi rivolgerti. Non so bene per gli altri stati, ma qui a New York è come essere in una città che racchiude tutti i diversi paesi, quindi non ti può mancare nulla. L'unica cosa un po' diversa è la mentalità della gente. Vengono tutti da tutte le parti del mondo con idee ben chiare: lavorare o studiare. Qui sono tutti soli e hanno tutti bisogno di qualcuno, ma nello stesso tempo nessuno si fida di nessuno e di conseguenza tutti si sentono molto soli perché hanno lasciato la famiglia nei rispettivi paesi e non riescono a trovare una persona di cui fidarsi abbastanza da poterla chiamare amica. Malgrado ciò, si riesce comunque a scontrare il successo e a divertirsi con gente che è meglio definire conoscenti, ma che può eventualmente diventare amici.|`|O5eGuqXvaa	Primo, il trattamento che ricevi nei negozi o nei ristoranti e` talmente cordiale che spaventa:) Secondo, pensare sempre che i prezzi non sono tali e che le tasse verranno aggiunte alla cassa...terzo, se non hai un' auto a volte non puoi muoverti neppure per comprare piccole cose....<br>  <br>  Ma tutto si può superare:)))|`|o2Phnwqgaa	rispondo da profana:<br>  <br>  *lontananza dagli affetti (comune a tutti i trasferimenti)<br>  *assicurazione sanitaria<br>  *sentirsi provvisori, ospiti, con regole burocratiche tanto ferree da farti sentire sottopressione che se sgarri di un centimetro son ca**i |`|evG6zBBKaa	il sistema sanitario<br>  la lingua,<br>  niente altro, perche` x quanto riguarda il cibo c'e` e ci sono tutti i prodotti italiani.Hai voglia di mangiare tu!<br>  <br>  io abito a NY.|`|ze8p2Jfvaa	Allora, Evidentemente queste persone qua sopra, non sanno niente sugli stati uniti.

Concordo con la mancanza di veri rapporti di amicizia, con l'assenza di una cultura paragonabile alla nostra (anche se oggi questa tradizione culturale si sta per troppi motivi estinguendo e siamo proiettati verso il modello americano basato su comportamenti demenziali) e con le enormi distanze da affrontare.

526ac0abd00fd912d49c0f171335cbbaaa	We've been to Hedo 2 and 3 each for a week at a time.<br>  <br>  They have the nude side and the prude side (Hedo 3 has a mixed quad pool).  Probably 90% of people will be on the nude side, and the prude side will be pretty much deserted except for people going to eat.<br>  <br>  The nude side is pretty much mandatory nudity, as you have just a few minutes before the guards start to harrass you to get nude.  They have a lot of security.  The prude side allows topless and they aren't going to kick you out for being nude except in the restaurants.  <br>  <br>  The food is ok.  Nothing bad, nothing superb, but it is all you can eat, and all you can drink food.  No tipping is allowed.  <br>  <br>  It will let you (encourage you) to let out your wild side.  Unless you are a total prude (ie Church Lady) you'll get used to going to nude places and it does get addictive.  It's not an orgy, but is very sexually charged.  The average age is probably low thirties, but there will be people from 18 (a few) to in their 70s (a few, but they are very entertaining).   The nightclub will allow pretty much anything from sexy to nude.  <br>  <br>  The rooms vary from nice to mediocre.  Some of them leak, and it's a crap shoot as to how well your AC will work.  The showers are nice (multiple head), and it will make you do a double take when you walk out of the room naked.  <br>  <br>  Depending on the week you go there, things will range from PDAs to more during the day, and late at night it gets pretty open as to what they allow.  <br>  <br>  If you are looking for 5 star place to hang out topless only - Hedo 2 ain't it.  If you are looking for a place to let your hair down (and your clothes too), it's a blast.  <br>  <br>  If you just want topless and high end - go to Grand Lido.  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|m0DgqEcjaa	There is a nude beach, my husband took me there in May 2007 for 2 nights (he works for an hotel in Trelawny that is part of the same company) and to be honest i didn't like it.

There are a ton of things to do and see as well.   If you are looking for fun in the sun and an all over tan, Hedo is the way to go.  There are also several other nude and/or topless resorts in the Caribbean as well.     Any questions, let me know.   I'd be happy to talk to you about it.

If not, look into the point system for immigration. Immigrating to the UK from the US is very difficult - and vise versa if you are not a highly desired immigrant. If you can land a job with a firm there - that would be useful in getting a visa.<br>  <br>  I would also check with the nearest British embassy and expat (Americans in Britain) websites - they might be of help.|`|CW8tJeUJaa	All those people so positive about Britain obviously have not been affected by the American Credit crunch.<br>  Please stay where you are you. <br>  Why do you think 2000 people each year are leaving Britain its because of high prices, high tax, Our government is as corrupt as any other government in the world only they do it in a legal way by screwing the people who live here, Why do you think we call it Rip off Britain.<br>  Yes we have many immigrants entering the UK, this is probably why the British are moving out, but for them its fine most are coming from countries with no human rights and are now playing that card here to their advantage, If you are born and bread in the UK and your parents fought in the war then you are a third rate citizen our ancestors who fought in the war would be turning in their graves now <br>  We are rapidly loosing our freedom of speech it is becoming a dictatorial country..<br>  But as you are not British you should be fine. Just throw your passport over board on your way and you will get anything you like.<br>  <br>  Oh and any one wishing to know yes i am leaving the country Just as soon as i can sell my house But thanks to America  who are taking the rest of the world down with them that could be one hell of a long time now.<br>  <br>  <br>  Thank you for your email<br>  tried to reply but it was sent back so here goes<br>  <br>  Falling in love with a country and living there are two different things. Yes we have a lovely country just a shame it has been over run with people who are not welcome.can not name specifics for the reason i mentioned we are loosing our freedom of speech here, but, i think or hope you get my drift. more and more countries are joining the EU but instead of staying put they land on our soil have children then bring their families along. they don't work they sponge of the government and we have to pay for them. Education is not up to standard Health care is not up to standard the government has a huge black hole of dept to fill and we have to pay.By that i mean the one's who are working and doing things legitimately. If you are on computer you get billed<br>  On the other side of thing immigrants are also taking jobs away from our trade people as they can afford to charge less for their work, as their government are paying for their qualification and housing. We are now heading into a recession our economy has never been as bad in fifty years. businesses are closing down houses being repossessed and unemployment rising.<br>  It could take two to three years for the situation to improve.<br>  i am getting married in November and i was going to join my husband in his country but as now i have no way of selling my house i am stuck here until things improve. which means my future husband has to move to a country that he does not like until we can get out.<br>  In that time there is no guarantee i will be able to keep my house as jobs now are not guaranteed.<br>  So yes i am totally fed up of America as they have screwed not just my life but the lives of many.<br>  You say your heart brings you here and god.<br>  well i don't know about your heart whether you have fallen in love with someone here or you just love the country.<br>  well if its the latter then like i said its good to visit but not to live<br>  Sorry to be frank but god will not help you over here neither. he only helps himself<br>  He is the main cause of a lot of the problems in this country with stupid religions that people want to impose on us.<br>  This is a christian country and will always be that way anyone coming here should respect that.<br>  We have our history and it should stay that way.<br>  Why should we be told not to do this and not to do that for the fear of insulting others. Its our way of life and goes back hundreds of years.<br>  I am surprised you even know where England is, normally Americans don't even know there is a world beyond America<br>  Whenever i have spoken to an American and said," i come from England", i usually get the response of <br>  "Oh new England is so lovely in the fall".<br>  My response to that is.<br>  "Well Great Britain is even better maybe you should look it up on the world map. Do they sell world maps in America or only maps of America".<br>  My other reason for not liking America is i am Marrying a Cuban.<br>  Need i say any more on that subject.<br>  <br>  Quite frankly i should advise you to stay put, for now anyway maybe in three years it may get better but if the eastern side of the world have their way it will just get worse.<br>  <br>  RegardsMC|`|UTql7vKkaa	First of all don't take advice from people who live in the UK and have never lived anywhere else, this country is full of negative people who don't know when they're onto a good thing.  Maybe that in itself is a good reason not to come to the UK.<br>  <br>  But, if this country is so bad why don't these people actually leave and why do we have so many immigrants?  Rant over.<br>  <br>  It's one thing I admire about the Americans, if a kid was to say "One day I am going to be president" in the US their parents would encourage them and say "go for it" - if a kid over here said "One day I am going to be Prime-minister" there's a good chance their parents would say "Don't be so stupid".  But not all British are like that.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I digress, again, lol!<br>  <br>  This website will help you:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/</a><br>  <br>  If you want specific advice or opinions about living in the UK, then you know where to ask.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  For those people who moan about the country they live in:  If you don't like it, then leave, nobody is stopping you.  Instead of just moaning do something about it.<br>  <br>  I've used the Health Service a lot in the past 10 years as I suffer from a chronic illness and overall my experience has been good.  It's not perfect but a lot better than the US where they don't have a National Health Service.<br>  <br>  As for crime, if you live in the inner-cities it might be bad, but it's certainly not as bad as in some of the major US cities where shootings are relatively common.  Lincolnshire would be a good choice to live as crime is low, although the pace of life can be slow, depends what you are looking for.  I live in Lincolnshire for a few years when I was in my teens and didn't experience any crime.<br>  <br>  Did you know about 50% of those who leave the UK to emigrate return a few years later out of choice?  Thought not, try doing a little research in future please.<br>  <br>  As requested, here's some research for you:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://fleshisgrass.wordpress.com/2007/04/17/us-and-uk-murder-rate-and-weapon/" rel="nofollow">http://fleshisgrass.wordpress.com/2007/0...</a><br>  <br>  US murder rate is 5 times that of the UK.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1569400/Emigration-soars-as-Britons-desert-the-UK.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1...</a><br>  <br>  50% of emigrants return.<br>  <br>  The grass is always greener on the other side, unfortunately people don't realise that until they grow up.  Britain is far from perfect, but it's a lot better than a lot of other countries|`|rlqdMZXeaa	wanna swap |`|4033d300c72c47096136e93fe9835c09aa	(I really wish people who are so negative about living here would just leave, you're more than welcome to go anywhere in the EU so leave if you hate life here so badly, then judge.)<br>  <br>  I believe you would enjoy the UK and your children would have a good life depending on where you choose so before anything else try and identify the best location, I would suggest somewhere like Lincolnshire which is a brilliant place to grow up, great opportunities and quality of life.<br>  <br>  Choosing your exact location should be a priority, then go to a British Embassy for info about moving to the UK.|`|OWoytzEEaa	i totally agree with David W
d070c8be759df6826176585adb2649f9aa	I went everywhere around europe from April to July and it was beautiful with rain here and there. It's nice because if you have to backpack or get a crappy hostel, the weather is still nice at night if there is no heating, but during the day it doesn't get scorching. I spent the first half in the southern countries and moved upwards at the end. Belgium/Denmark/Northern Germany is beautiful in July.|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	Early May or late September. the weather is still good, and the crowds have mostly gone. <br>  <br>  However, for places like Paris, London, you need to move further off season, as they are still a zoo. Stay away from Christmas.<br>  <br>  .|`|2OYBurgTaa	Mid-end of March. Yes it's cold but you can nip down to southern  France or Italy to warm up. It's THE BEST time to go because there are fewer tourists and no line ups to things. It makes you feel like you're experiencing it on your own and not just as one of the masses. I did it this way and wouldn't change a thing.|`|NZxeCLG0aa	there are always tourists all over europe so there's really no way to avoid that, but as for the other things probably late april or during may is the best time, it wont be cold in the northern countries and you might also be able to visit the beaches|`|jNQqor8Eaa	At night!, no really I agree with K girl, spring is best as it is not too crowded and the Hospitality industry will treat you better because they will be fresh for a new season. Also you will find some better bargins on prices.

E5gaKzCsaa	I lived there for 25 years. Yes, it's nice. It's safe, though there's a little crime like everywhere. Is it fun? Depends what you like to do for fun. There's lots of outdoor activity, excellent parks and hiking, good rec centres with swimming pools and skating rinks, pretty good restaurants, a few movie theatres.<br>  <br>  Transportation by bus is pretty good, though there are a few areas that aren't very well served. How long it can take to get downtown depends where in North Van you're starting from, but the longest on a bus is about an hour. Much less time if you're driving. It's not very cold, but North Vancouver goes from sea level to fairly high up a mountain, and it can be snowing higher up when it's raining at sea level.<br>  <br>  There are rich people in North Vancouver but not as many as in West Vancouver right next door. North Van is mostly people who are middle class though perhaps many are on the wealthier side of that.

Ma sei proprio sicura che puoi stare in America per tre anni? Per quel che ne so io i turisti possono stare in Usa e Canada per massimo 90 giorni.

Il problema è che tutto questo viene dilapidato dalla maggioranza degli italiani, che se ne fregano altamente delle risorse che hanno a disposizione. Molti considerano la cultura e il vivere civile come due criteri poco importanti e questo ovviamente incide sull'intero processo.<br>  Mi dispiace deluderti ma gli stranieri invidiano esclusivamente quello che abbiamo, non certamente quello che siamo. Infatti vengono in vacanza da noi (anche se meno di prima) ma non si azzarderebbero mai a venirci a vivere (salvo sporadiche eccezioni di casali in Toscana o ville sul Lago di Como).<br>  Ci sono altri paesi che dovremmo invidiare, la maggior parte di questi si trova in Scandinavia. Certo, fa un po' freddo, ma non così tanto come si possa immaginare. Per farti un esempio oggi a Oslo ci sono 6° e a Milano 9°. Per tutto il resto considero queste nazioni le ideali per viverci.|`|baed6e5da7182ff733cadb76b60a69f8aa	Ottima osservazione...con una punta di modestia.|`|a3d9ce99330ad25bd55dcd73b83d3649aa	Ma che film hai visto?

They may be fined and jailed. The operator of such illegal gambling den will be dealt with more severely.|`|L2AWPUVXaa	If the gambling den is ILLEGAL then its a crime but since you have two ILLEGALS  then it cancels each other out and it's not a crime anymore!!!!

f9fa6dd50ee61f143c2304d45b0c411daa	Depends if you're planning to drive, I stayed  in Universal city which was was great for universal studios park and city walk, most studios, Hollywood but was a 40min drive to Anaheim  .There is a rail station (red line) near the hotel (Hilton) it took us less than an hour to LAX and 20min to Union Station.<br>  The Hilton Universal City was very nice and we got a good deal less than $100/night for a double room, most hotels in LA areas are cheaper but we chose not to rent a car so we needed to be close to public transportation and not far from Hollywood.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	Since LA is so spread out, there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING. Most people who come here tend to stay in Hollywood, Santa Monica, or Anaheim.<br>  In Hollywood, I recommend the Renaissance Hotel at Hollywood and Highland, the Best Western Sunset Plaza, or the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame. <br>  In Santa Monica, the Holiday Inn Santa Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced.<br>  In Anaheim, I recommend the Howard Johnson (HoJo) Anaheim, and the Candy Cane Inn.
MATiTs5Oaa	Yes, there are.<br>  Sometimes people date, and get married. Especially when they are educated, have jobs etc.<br>  Most of the times, they see each other a couple of times ( with a relative or friend around- just like 19 th century England- a chaperone)  and have a chance to chat a little, to learn about each other , then if no one objects, the couple gets engaged.<br>  In the South eastern  parts of Turkey, the situation  sometimes gets worse. The father arranges the marriage with the groom or sometimes with the groom's family without the bride's consent. They are trying to prevent this, but there are traditions to be fought against. Many people are  ignorant, so it is hard to prevent it.|`|7vD4dBK4aa	Legaly No in western turkey you wont have this problem (well you will but to a limited extent) but in the east you may come across it more.|`|f71fa28fc2e116f91dc366b8dfe18a14aa	I believe yes as per other parts of the world too.

In which case you will need to visit HK every three years. The right of abode and the right to land are two completely different issues.<br>  <br>  If you are a 'permanent resident' - you are 'supposed' to come in and out of HK every 3 years. However, we have a super guy on the radio here who is a whizz with the rules and he reckons you would have to do something pretty bad (like a stretch in a foreign jail) to actually lose your permanent ID resident status - even if you did not come back every 3 years.<br>  <br>  You cannot wait in transit - that does not mean a visit as you have to go through immigration to be entered into the computer.<br>  <br>  We now have smart ID cards where we don't have to use a passport to enter or leave HK (have you upgraded yours? If not, do so next time you visit - free of course and the guys at Immigration are very efficient.)<br>  <br>  I am a British expat who has been living in HK way over 20 years and I have permanent status - yet - if I moved to Blighty (god forbid) or anwhere else, I too would have to come through HK every 3 years.<br>  <br>  But, like I have mentioned - you can have good reasons why you didn't return, study, travel, family, etc. But if you are ethnic Chinese the 36month rule does not apply. Take a look on the website if you are worried. You only need to go through immigration for 24 hours.<br>  <br>  A real flying visit.

Tu non ti rendi conto.<br>  <br>  Se proprio hai deciso di PERDERE il tuo PREZIOSISSIMO lavoro NEL TUO PAESE per tentare un'incognita assurda e irrazionale, segui il consiglio che ti ha scritto la ragazza dopo di me: FAI LA BABYSITTER per un anno in USA (au pair). Chiaramente è un lavoro a mala pena retribuito: prendi vitto e alloggio dalla famiglia dove stai; se gli rigira ti fanno guidare la loro macchina per andare a prendere i bambini, e cose simili. Ma non ti puoi muovere e non puoi girare, se non un paio di settimane di ferie che ti daranno una volta durante il tuo anno di lavoro.<br>  Così vedi com'è e se è il caso di sposarti qualche babbione americano per ottenere la green card :)<br>  <br>  Ciao|`|EuY9FJvAaa	ti sconsiglio di cercare lavoro tramite internet, rischi di prendere solo cantonate. Puoi: <br>  1. farti aiutare da qualcuno che già lavora e abita negli stati uniti e quindi conosce già chi ha bisogno di un aiuto in azienda o meno, oppure<br>  2. inizi col fare un viaggetto che in realtà ti servirà per andare alla ricerca di un lavoro, e quindi all'inizio ti daranno un visto per turismo, una volta che hai fatto un giro e ti renderai conto di come è la vita là, potrai decidere di ritornare nuovamente o meno. <br>  Lavorare negli USA non è facile perchè per lavorare devi avere un visto per lavoro, ma se non ce l'hai nessuno ti assume. è un gatto che si morde la coda, in poche parole. <br>  Ti consiglio di terminare gli studi, altrimenti negli USA avresti soltanto un futuro da cameriera che fa il turno di notte e abita in una topaia. Con un diploma potresti essere ad esempio assunta dalle compagnie aeree e da aziede turistiche. Facci un pensierino. |`|O5wKe862aa	Ma perché proprio gli Stati Uniti? Guarda che non sono più i tempi di Happy Days, oggi gli States stanno andando a picco. Una mia amica ci ha vissuto per 6 anni e me ne ha parlato malissimo. Assistenza sanitaria zero, se non hai i soldi crepi, devi fare il doppio o triplo lavoro perché uno stipendio non basta; le armi te le vendono al supermercato con le conseguenze che conosciamo; senza soldi non sei nessuno, molta gente vive nelle roulotte, mangiano male, bevono birra come spugne, sono obesi... dimmi cosa ci trovi di bello....|`|m36gi2UDaa	Sei ancora molto giovane... prendi il diploma di maturità come privatista e la patente. Poi candidati per andare a fare un anno la ragazza alla pari negli States (ti consiglio di affidarti ad un'agenzia), così da avere il tempo e la possibilità di vedere se davvero ti può piacere vivere lì. Se ti renderai conto che ti piace, potresti provare a cercare sul posto una sponsorizzazione lavorativa che ti permetta di restare (ma non è semplice e adesso, con la crisi economica, lò è ancora di meno) oppure sposarti un cittadino statunitense.<br>  In ogni caso sei ancora giovane e, secondo me, fai bene a farti un'esperienza all'estero; ma tieni bene in mente che potresti anche non trovarti bene o semplicemente dopo un po' stufarti e sentire la nostalgia dell'Italia.|`|9ODPh6hqaa	Ti ci vuole un "Visto di soggiorno" per lavoro.<br>  In USA non puoi permanere per oltre 90 giorni con il solo passaporto. Inoltre "legalmente" durante questo periodo non puoi lavorare poiché per i 90 gg di cui sopra si parla e si presume siano giorni turistici.<br>  In realtà non è del tutto vero che non si possa lavorare: non puoi risultare sul libro paga di una qualunque azienda USA ma puoi essere sul libro paga di una azienda italiana che ti manda in USA per, ad esempio, corporate meeting. In altre parole non puoi produrre PIL in USA senza un visto. Il visto (VISA) deve essere sponsorizzato o da una azienda estera (per gli USA) che ha un ufficio in USA o da una stessa azienda americana. Il periodo di permanenza varia a seconda del tipo di visto e dopo 3 anni hai diritto a richiedere la green card (che non ti concedono subito). Al consolato americano ti possono dare molte informazioni (on-line).<br>  Non c'è altro modo.<br>  L'ideale credo sarebbe farti assumere da una società italiana che ha bisogno di espandersi in USA.<br>  Valuta se ti è possibile nel frattempo fare una visita, per vedere com'è. Giusto per capire se questi USA sono proprio quello che cerchi.<br>  In pocca al lupo !|`|uRSSJXm2aa	Questo è un sito che ti dà informazioni e aiuto per trasferirsi e trovare lavoro in Usa.

2HETgiwgaa	It is a gamble either way - fares can go go up or down.  Often (certainly for domestic flights) the cheapest way to buy seats is well in advance, but specials do come up from time-to-time.  <br>  <br>  Air New Zealand auctions international fares with $1 reserves on sella.co.nz on weekly 24 hour sales (Thursdays, I think). Don't get too excited about the reserve though, they do go up a LOT from there and there's no guarantee that there'll be any to Japan when you want to go - but it's worth a try :)|`|d2QVB6Qyaa	It is very difficult to know what will happen with airfares. A couple of years ago we went to Japan on a fare that came up -half price for the month of May. But they didn't repeat that last year and it was very short notice - 10 days. <br>  <br>  Have a look at cheap flights at <a href="http://www.fascinating-travel-destinations.com/cheap-airfares.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fascinating-travel-destinatio...</a>  and see what comes up. Personally I would be very wary of Jetstar.They charge outrageous prices for everything including water - $6 US for a dry sandwich, $4US for an average size  bottle of water etc and can also at the last minute change how you fly and you end up spending many hours more in the air than you need to.We lost a day each way going to Vietnam, and having to overnight in Ho Chi Minh. You are better to pay a bit more and go with an  airline that gets you there comfortably and on time!I l also think by the time you add up all the extra costs it is not as different to a higher fare that includes everything as you think. <br>  <br>  You just need to keep checking fares, but eventually will need to make a decision to purchase.Air NZ has blackboard fares, which change daily.|`|rvTcDJ6yaa	You are going in their summer which will be a high fare time.<br>  I think jetstar go to Osaka ( jetstar.co.nz?)...and have some cheap airfares ( but its a budget airline).. but you might have to go from chch<br>  try www.expedia.co.nz for main airlines as i ahve always found it decent.

KWZdVwQ5aa	I grew up in AZ and couldn't wait to leave. I'm currently in Seattle and taking a trip to San Francisco later this month to see if I l'd like it there.<br>  <br>  I love the cold, rain, clouds and foggy days. I hate cactus, deserts, a dry heat. Az is ugly and bare. I like it in WA becuase everything is green and lush and full of life. <br>  <br>  Maybe you liked AZ because it was a great vacation time. I understand why some people like it though, the grass is always greener on the other side.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	i lived in CA my whole life up until a couple of years ago when i moved out here. i like the fact that there's more wildlife out here and that it's a really pretty place. the people are a lot nicer too. i do miss the beaches in my hometown though. arizona is a nice place to visit but i don't really enjoy living here, there's not enough to do. i miss the hustle and bustle of city life. this place lacks a certain amount of other cultures that i'm used to too.|`|Bm2SntgHaa	I've lived in Arizona all my life, I love it. It is mostly desert but it does have forests and mountains which are great for camping and skiing. The town I live in has a very diverse climate. I live in Southern AZ and I think it's beautiful, and I'm just really connected to it. The culture is pretty diverse and I just love this place.|`|CsY022kvaa	People who grow up here hate it, move away, but, more often than not, come back when they discover that the West Coast or NYC (usually where they go) is not quite what they thought it would be.<br>  People who move here from other places that do, really, very much suck (Texas, etc.) tend to like it here. You just have to be able to deal with the heat.|`|s1Q9vnqmaa	I live in arizona and i absoultly hate it<br>  everything is dry no grass anywhere<br>  i love lush green full of life places this hell hole is not one of them<br>  I CANNOT WAIT till me and my family move out of here this summer.<br>  and currious omg i live in prescott valley!|`|rXInAcURaa	i would love love love love to go to Massachusetts. <br>  i live on prince edward island, a little island in canada, there is nothing to do, there is no designer stores and its always freezing !|`|cOxIhOtCaa	I personally love Arizona, even if it is a little dull at times. I hate rain and there's rarely rain or any weather-related disasters here, so it's perfect for me. And if you do happen to like snow or whatever, all you have to do is drive to either Tuson or Flagstaff. And unlike most people think, it is NOT all cacti and sand and ugliness. In fact, where I live, its very green and really pretty. Plus, it is super easy to find your way, and that's especially good for me, who gets lost in her own bedroom. =D haha. I especially love the downtown Glendale area. All the little shops are adorable. haha. But yeah, you could say I love it here! =D|`|4qEoDeyzaa	I was born in Phoenix & raised in Prescott; I HATE IT HERE!  I swore I would leave when I turned 18, but I got married & stuck here!

HUrYSp4oaa	yes u will be able to work, a lot of british and european companies prefer women on husbands visa as they dont have the costs of sponsoring them just getting a labour card.   Life in sharjah is good i used to live there its probably like dubai used to be before the influx of tourists, im british and not been to canada so cant compare for u but there are a lot of expats there so u will find many friends working or not, again i havent been to saudi so cant say from experience but i think it is definitely better and dubai is only 15 mins away by road (depending on the rush hour tho!) with all its facilities and malls. i used to prefer living in sharjah. the only thing with it is it is the only emirate that is "dry" ie no alcohol even in the hotels. not sure about expat residents i think they may get an allowance, but basically if ur want to have a drink u need to go to dubai (as i say not far away) or into ajman which is the smaller emirate the other side of u but there wasnt much there when i was there.   im sure it will be a great experience for u i would take it and good luck.|`|bs9Zbouaaa	Yea i think you can do but there is not have such freedom as in europe.

U enjoy absolute freedom. u can live as u wish. i dont knw wht ur culture or religion is but here u can wear western clothes; but not miniskirts and u know beach wear. jst make ur clothes a bit modest in respect to the cultute of the country. very safe for women to move around alone evn late at night. women njoy more freedom than in west bcoz here crime rate is negligible.<br>  As far as ur job yes u cn do a job in school or any cmpany!<br>  Ask me hw sorry i m to leave!|`|DSVUvfGuaa	Sharjah is a lovely place to be at.

It was designed by Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen and structural engineer Hannskarl Bandel in 1947. It stands 630 feet (192 m) tall, and is 630 feet (192 m) wide at its base, making it the tallest monument in the United States.[3] Construction of the arch started on February 12, 1963 and was completed on October 28, 1965. The monument opened to the public on July 24, 1967.
qN4Pt4kUaa	Well I remember perfectly that last year it was warm, sunny and beautiful around those dates. Last year around these dates I remember it was very sunny and warm as well.<br>  <br>  As for this year nothing is for sure. Lately the days have been gloomy and chilly and even when the sun comes out there's still those cold breezes that bring chills down your spine. And the next few days (maybe weeks) look like it will remain the same with the occasional rain.<br>   But then again the weather can definitely change in a month and one week or two. You will most likely have to keep paying attention to weather forecasts as the days approach.<br>  <br>  Oh, well one thing is for sure though: You should definitely not expect thunderstorms or harsh rain though. If anything I really, really doubt this ugly weather will last till then.

And then, visit the usual things: Hollywood, Venice, Disneyland, the Universal studios, etc. Don't be afraid if you go out at night and find yourself in streets crowded with homeless people.

bNBpwCEOaa	I use www.cruisecompete.com<br>  <br>  This website shops the best prices for you!|`|zxl30SARaa	I have always heard it is cheaper to go through a travel agent for packages like this since they usually have better negotiating power for air AND cruise tickets at time of purchase- I use a Travelocity partner that can give you an awesome deal. just let me know if you want her #..|`|RDgyb7W8aa	Personally I would book flight and cruise separately.  For flights go to Kayak.com.  It will give you all flight prices specific days, it includes the arline site, cheap tickets, expedia, travelocity, orbiz and gives cheapest flight per airline.  As for cruise booking, use your travel agent or cruise line site.  Since you are flying independent, be sure to tell them you want airport transfers.  Never buy airline from cruise line, they are very expensive.

AA10073270	No.. ma qui ho trovato forse delle info (in inglese) che forse ti possono essere utili<br>  <br>  Accommodation<br>  Most institutions of higher education in the Netherlands do not have campus accommodation for their students. Many students live at their parents', with host families or in student houses. Exchange students can choose from the following options:<br>  AMVJ Hostel Geleen<br>  Op de Vey 66<br>  NL-6165 CD Geleen<br>  <br>  Landlord/ proprietor: Mr. J.

This accommodation is simple, but clean and comfortable. Full board is provided, although you are expected to prepare your own breakfast in the morning. There is a garden and a television room and the hostel offers some sport facilities. The hostel is located in the town centre of Geleen, at approximately 3 kilometres from Sittard). The rent is approximately EUR 420 per month (including a full meal plan and all service charges!). There is a small extra charge for staying over in the weekends. The minimum period of stay is 3 months. AMVJ caters to students - and business interns - from many nationalities and is a non profit organisation. The hostel can provide bicycles at approx. EUR 8 per month (it takes about 15 minutes to reach the business school by bike). Alternatively there is a bus service near the hostel and the railway station is at a stone's throw.<br>  <br>  Student accommodation at Watersley in Sittard<br>  On the outskirts of Sittard, at the top of a hill, students can be accommodated at:<br>  Apartment building "Aan den Driesch"<br>  Watersley 3<br>  NL-6132 KA SITTARD<br>  <br>    <br>                                   Watersley in Sittard<br>  The rooms for single occupancy are small and furnished and all rooms have a private shower.

The rent amounts to about EUR 210 a month, including service charges. There is a bus stop at the bottom of the hill and bicycles can be rented at about EUR 8 per month.<br>  <br>  Sittard Student Accommodation Office<br>  The Sittard Student Accommodation Office or Stichting Kamerbureau Sittard, has a database of rooms that can be rented by students. Because of the rapidly rising number of applications for student accommodation, it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain a room through this office. However, it is always worth a try!<br>  An administration fee of approximately EUR 18 is charged as well as a deposit, which will be returned if the room is in good order. The deposit usually amounts to the rent that is to be paid for one month. Monthly rents are between EUR250 and EUR300 for furnished rooms.  The rooms for single occupancy are small and furnished and all rooms have a private shower. Bedlinen and towels are provided. Toilets and kitchen facilities are shared with other students on the corridor. In the basement, you can make use of coin-operated washing machines and driers.

There is a chi-chi's Restaurant there.|`|2ef741daaae858ba51d1adc28a4d5be5aa	Well that all depends on how old you are and what you like to do here in the states.. I am assuming that you are in a military family... If this is correct then there are alot of things to do, it will be a great oppertunity to travel, mwr has a ton of trips going all over europe, they are really inexpensive and a good time for the whole family or even with one parent when the other is deployed or in training.... you will be close to prague, berlin, franfort, munich, bamberg, all are within a few hours of vilseck, you can go anywhere and everywhere on the train, do your self a favor and learn a bit of German. it will help you to read signs and feel more comfortable when you are out and about in germany... last time i was there.. 2 years ago.. Vilseck had a really nice bowling alley and a decent movie theater... your whole family should get your visas, if you dont already have them...it is quicker and easier to get them while you are in the states... Clubs are a big part of the local scene, but not how you would think they are in the states, the focus isnt really on drinking per say but more of a hang out and dance spot... I guess it all depends on what you like to do now and how old you are... hope that helps|`|S4UkG1U8aa	my husband is already there and now me and my daughter r trying to get there. don't let people tell you its great. i'm sure once u and ur family r there that it is. BUT, i have been trying to get there since Jan. who ever is in charge of command sponsorship over there is an idiot!. when my husband was in processing they didn't take him to fill out any paperwork for it. thank god i had already started it before he left. though now they r telling us that i have to redo it cause it was navy done and they want the army to sign off on it. i have never heard of such bull **** before.my dad was in the navy my whole childhood. what it really is, is that the people over in vilseck don't care about the families. they don't want to do the right paperwork. they figure if they mess up enough that the spouses are going to give up and stay in the states. then they don't have to find housing for us or deal with us at all. you really need to be asking allot of question and start the paperwork now. ur wife and kids can't do or get anything until the command sponsorship is done and signed off on. no passports, can't even get on the housing list. i'm not even there yet and i hate it!
x8mq03c5aa	Mira olvidate de todas las chorradas que dice la gente, te voy a dar una respuesta totalmente cientifica y demostrada,  de alguien que ha estudiado mucha Fisica.<br>  <br>  El concepto del tiempo es relativo a la velocidad de la persona, esto es: Si una persona se mueve a velocidad mucho mayor que la otra, su tiempo ira mas lento. <br>  <br>  Se ilustra mejor con un ejemplo, si 2 gemelos, uno se queda en la tierra, y el otro se pone a dar vueltas alrededor de la tierra a velocidades cercanas a la de la luz, cuando para el que va mas rapido con respecto al otro pase 1 a?o, para el de la tierra pueden haber pasado 100 a?os. Por lo tanto el gemelo de la nave ha "viajado" en el tiempo, en 1 a?o ha viajajo 100 a?os. <br>  <br>  Si tu lanzas una pelota a 10 km/hora, una persona parada la vera pasar a 10km/hora, y una persona corriendo al lado de la pelota a 6 km/hora la vera pasar a 4km/hora (10-6). <br>  Pero en cambio con la luz es diferente, si una persona lanza un rayo de luz a la velocidad de la luz, por mucho que corras al lado de ella a velocidades cercanas a su veocidad siempre la veras igual de rapida, y claro esto es fisicamente imposible, algo tiene que cambiar de alguien parado con respecto a alguien moviendose, y eso es el tiempo.<br>  <br>  Eisntein lo demostro, no es una chorrada.<br>  <br>  Se dice que si alguien superara la velocidad de la luz el tiempo se atrasaria, pero esto es imposible por varios motivos, uno de ellos es que la velocidad de la luz es insuperable.|`|6IhCqzBpaa	Es lo que siempre ha sonado el hombre pero creo que solo en nuestra mente puede existir, seria bello, mas es imposible|`|Uyqk8u7faa	Noo.. el futuro lo estamos contruyendo en el presente.. y el pasado ya paso.. no puede ser que puedes ir al pasado o al futuro.. por que no existen..|`|666d51b8fb75916f841d270173d92a55aa	bueno lo de la maquina del tiempo  sonaba descabellado en el pasado pero a medida que avanza la tegnologia se estan descubriendo  teorias relmente increibles <br>  asi que en mi opinion nanie puede decir que es algo inposible el viajar en el tiempo <br>  hay muchas cosas que ahora no entendemos como en el pasado no se podis entender que el planeta tierra giraba alrededor del sol|`|fUoMrFC9aa	te recomiendo que veas la pelicula de dejabo con denzel washington, ahi plantean lo de los viajes en el tiempo,  y las teorias son buenas, en mi parecer, no es imposible hacer algo asi, pero x desgracia esa seria una arma de dos filos, ya q si cae en malas manos, pues imaginate todo lo q podria pasar, lo chido seria a modo personal, cada uno de nosotros quisiera regresar y cambiar ciertas cosas.  buena pregunta eh, = )

W8QpLEh8aa	hello, of course, cash is always accepted whereas credit cards are not always, so the decision on whether a person should always carry enough money depends on how common the usage of a credit card is in japan. the common knowledge is that credit cards are not widely accepted in japan. there are many retail stores and restaurants that accept only cash, however they are getting less and less. likewise, It was only 3 years ago that all the companies of Japan Railway began to accept credit card payments. nevertheless, you can buy train tickets from automated machines only with cash. a person should not expect the same acceptability in some other credit-card friendly countries from japan.|`|AHEFXgE7aa	The yen is so strong, so I would delay any transactions that involve buying yen.  A credit card is not an option at a lot of places so if you have the cash, you will have to use it.<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|vS80xcoHaa	Japan is a cash-based society. Everyone will tell you that. <br>  <br>  It is not like the USA where you can get by with a debit card.

cMZEmpp0aa	There is no direct American equivalent for a geisha (or for an oiran or tayuu for that matter -- and I wouldn't call oiran or tayuu hookers or strippers...they're much closer to courtesans). We have people here who dance, sing, play musical instruments, serve as hostesses, etc, but generally they aren't expected to do all of those things at once -- for example, if you go someplace with a dancer as entertainment it's highly unlikely that she'll also be your hostess, a partner for games, AND a conversation partner. A geisha, on the other hand, could very well spend her evening being a dancer AND game partner AND conversation partner AND something of a hostess, all at one party. And that's ignoring the many other things geisha do outside of the typical evening parties, like their participation in special festivals like Baikasai, Setsubun, or the Gion Matsuri.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	We don't have one. And A Geisha wasn't a stripper or a hooker. Ignorant people.|`|3VD8fWF8aa	depending on their 'duties' it ranges from a singer, to a Vegas style show girl, or a cabaret dancer, or a high class hooker.<br>  <br>  Geisha, depending on their rank and talent, did any combination of the above.|`|eAMbWkahaa	There is no american equiv.  simple as that.  Just like there's no equiv. to the Emperor or royal family in the US.<br>  <br>  Geisha are not prostitutes nor strippers, thats old propaganda from ignorant people.|`|AHEFXgE7aa	Nonexistent, which is why you can't find any information.  It is a lifestyle totally incompatible  with American culture.<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|55ef67a1ec3f06e6f365e48d4a54535faa	Nancy Reagan or Paris Hilton.|`|B2jIiOwnaa	Sorry--there's no American equivalent.  And to settle the "hooker" debate once and for all............<br>  <br>  Reputable geisha were not sexually available to just anyone.  They did however barter sex for money and other items.  If you've seen Memoirs of a Geisha, you know all about "mizuage"--the selling of a geisha's virginity.  Often, the buyer would carry on an intimate relationship with her afterward.  Her providing him with sex and him providing her with tangible gifts would be part of that deal.  Other times, though, a relationship would not ensue.  But, with the exception of that case, a geisha's sexual skills were not to be dispensed on a "one-time-use" basis, which, on the other hand, is typical of hookers.<br>  <br>  Today, being a geisha does *not* involve sex!  But around resorts in Japan, you still find hookers pretending to be geisha.  They're trying to appeal to foreigners who don't know anything about real geisha (and/or who don't care).  They have no or very little training in the traditional arts.  <br>  <br>  ...sorry..I hope I didn't write too much.|`|j1Yae2q9aa	Contrary to popular belief, Geishas are not whores.  They are theatrical entertainers, and the American counterpart does not exist.  If an answer is necessary, try looking into broadway or even deeper like CATZ.  Their not the same by any means, but it's the idea of theater that may matter.  I don't know much more, but I mainly replied just to say that geishas are not whores like in post #1.|`|lB8Owytiaa	A geisha is not a stripper or hooker. You are thinking of an oiran.  And they are right; there is no American equivalent.

You should visit some of the Sydney beaches Bondi and/or Manly for majoy tourist areas but there are also some lovely quiet beaches off the tourist track like Harbord and Bronte. Should also go into the bush like the National Park in the South of Sydney.  You have to go to The Rocks which has a lot of history and also go to Paddington Markets. Amazing range of things to buy.

I would go to northern Queensland instead of Melbourne (Melbourne is too boring and depressing, the weather is overcast most days). If you do go you should see Crown Casino which is the biggest and best in Australia. <br>  <br>  Cape Tribulation in Queensland is meant to be a must see, beautiful in every way (beaches, rainforest, weather, skydiving, wildlife).  Cairns is another.  <br>  <br>  I personally find the Gold Coast a bit tacky but that's just my opinion.<br>  <br>  Hope it  helps.|`|KZ30PZZvaa	Melbourne can be great if you go at the right time.

It's a lovely place to stroll around in on a hot summer day. Melbourne also has fantastic shopping!<br>  <br>  Going with mates will make it alot more interesting.<br>  <br>  Also look up bush areas to go. Where loriketes will come right up and sit on you and where you can see koalas etc.|`|R45yHlYjaa	You must visit Surfers Paradise in Queensland.

My parents don't like to talk to me anymore.<br>  <br>  Okay, I think you should bring a gaming console, or you could sleep.  If I was flying, I would sleep as much as possible, to catch up with the sleep I lost at home.  <br>  <br>  Or you can bring some paper and do some origami with some internet instructions.  <br>  <br>  1 hour and 45 minutes is not really that long at all.  You will be in Florida before you even realize it.  <br>  <br>  Have a wonderful and safe flight!  (I do not really know if I really helped, but basically I am just answering to wish you a safe flight.)|`|MXgrlSd0aa	Grab a couple new issues of your favorite magazines and before you know it, you'll be in sunny Florida.|`|R40lLWl3aa	Bring a map and try to figure out where you are flying over during the flight|`|i47AGNpJaa	Pray to the Christ Almighty above your plane doesn't take a nose dive in the Everglades or an orange grove.<br>  <br>  With all the air disasters in the past month, prayer is what you should do on the plane.

We need more info!|`|MVVQrEasaa	You aren't likely to talk your parents into moving just because you want to.  It's much more complicated than that - getting jobs, selling and buying houses, moving expenses etc.  They probably have good reasons for living in the town that you are in now, and it will be hard to get them to agree to move unless they have jobs that can move very easily.<br>  <br>  The best way for your to move to Seattle is to plan longer term, and for yourself.  Get good grades and apply to the UW, Seattle University and Seattle Pacific University.   You can go to school here, and be in the perfect position to find the job of your dreams out of college that will keep you here.|`|DhOjQM34aa	well...why do you wanna move there? give them all the good points about moving there and so on. but to be honest it will be a hard job persuading your parents. i mean its not like asking them for a raise in your allowance. but good luck!|`|dat8eoYyaa	tell them u love the rain|`|AA11622926	Why would you want to move to Seattle?<br>  It's always either raining, freezing, and windy or dry and unbearably hot here<br>  I'm 14 and live in Edmonds but I go to Seattle fairly often. Downtown Seattle is a lot of fun, but I wouldn't necessarily wanna move here if I were you.<br>  But since I'm not, I'd focus on the fact that there's lots to do here, there are a lot of suburbs and kids, people are very friendly, there's lts of shopping malls, we have a good metro system, etc...|`|ZZcsGRIvaa	Good luck.  I always wanted to move to Seattle but I finally just had to move up here myself when I was an adult.
alN2JxuUaa	I help by not littering the streets.<br>  <br>  It really pisses me seeing people in cars throwing their trash in the streets.|`|ZSAbJEv6aa	By paying taxes through which the government build schools/infrastructures and pay wages for government employees.  It may not amount to much but collectively, it can.  My contribution helps address the needs of our community.  This is how I help.  However, I am not sure if my small contribution goes to the right recipient.  <br>  <br>  When I see roads well paved, free medicines distributed to indigents in health centers, government in haste to give good service to the people in the community, I feel proud that I may have helped in the performance and efficacy of government and its departments.|`|MrhVcAqZaa	I guess so.<br>  <br>  I keep my own trash in my bag. Pay my community tax in our barangay.|`|KVlRYoidaa	i have eight kids to add to the community.|`|FBAmSYKKaa	I live in a small town in the northern part of Mindanao. I first came here when my father started working for a new industrial company that was being put up in the area. For the last 40 years, I have since brought up a family of my own and now have a business in the community where we offer to local customers low, affordable prices for school supplies aside from the business center we put up offering fax, photocopying and internet cafe services. The business not only helps our customers but also the people we employ and their families.<br>  <br>  I would say that it is the help you extend to others that would be the biggest contribution one can do. My Rotary Club has been in existence since 1981 and through the years, the members which include my husband and I, have done so many things, taking on many civic projects for the community like medical and dental missions.<br>  <br>  On a personal level, I have donated more than 7,000 books and other publications to 2 local high schools. The bulk of these came from my personal collection of many years while the rest were given to me by family and relatives when they learned I wanted to do something by giving back something tangible to the community that we have grown to love. I have always loved to read and wanted to share this love of reading to the younger set.<br>  <br>  My husband and I also make it a personal mission to go to a far-flung area in the municipality to give school supplies to Day-Care students and the public school students. We do this to help and not to get any recognition for it.<br>  <br>  If there's anything I can be proud of ,it is the fact that somehow in our own little way, there are some things you can do to help others.Helping and sharing, no matter how little or unimportant it may sound, is still a lot to those who are in need of it. So do your share, look around you and show you care by extending your hand and helping. It is the little things that count.|`|SNr7R0Z0aa	Communities aren't built, the individuals they're comprised of either exist or they don't.

1op04gcFaa	i believe that all people are equal only in the eyes of God. <br>  regarding human laws... people should be equal in the eyes of the human laws - that is why lady justice is always shown with a blind fold over her eyes.<br>  but the sad truth is that this equality in the eyes of the human laws is only a dead letter on a piece of paper. only valid in theory and always failing in practice. people are not equal in the eyes of human laws, and that is not only regarding nationality.<br>  maybe all comes back to the money again. person who has money (or has more money than his/her opponent) will have more resources and will be able to hire better lawyer/s to present his/her case before the judge. and you have inequality there from the start. do you think that a lawyer who is assigned to you as a public defender will defend you with the same eagerness as someone who you are paying a lot of money? in most cases not. but there are always exceptions.<br>  and we humans are not not perfect. the sad truth is that the majority of people are deceived with outside appearance. they think, if something looks great, shiny and perfect from the outside, then it has to be the same from the inside too. but it is seldom so. <br>  but there are still people who do not judge a book by its covers, but by what is inside...<br>  <br>  regarding mr Bush... the same applies here too. it is the question of power, the question of intimidation. the sad truth is that the one who has power is the one who rules the world. everyone else obey him not because they respect him, but because they fear him (and especially if he is also crazy and/or stupid). <br>  what is the power of sudan compared to the weapons of mass destruction that america has? how great is the fear that sudan can leave in the eyes of people compared to the fear that america rooted in the eyes of the world? does sudan have nuclear bombs as america has, as isreal has (just remember dimona and mordechai vanunu)? can sudan be responsible for the wiping the whole world by one push of the button? of course not!<br>  here lies your answer. the more powerful you are, the more you are able to get away with. thus, it is easy for the court in den haag to make an example of al-Bashir. <br>  by this i am not defending al-Bashir in any way. the man is responsible for the genocide in Darfur and he has to face trial and punishment. but the same rules have to be applied to everyone in the same way. and regarding same rules, same law for everyone, where were the ''world powers'' while Darfur was happening, what have they done to prevent the catastrophe. NOTHING! because that was not happening in america or in europe. just remember the war in former yugoslavia, just remember cambodia under the rule of khmer rouge, ruanda,... and how much time was spent and how many lives were allowed to perish until west decided to do something,...<br>  so much for the equality in the eyes of the human laws, where life is not worth a thing unless it is backed up with money, with power, with fear...|`|AA10755943	Not necessarily.

I dont know where you live but you might approach some small shops close to your home. Dont rule out dress stores too because some like to offer accessories. There's also craft fairs. There is also an online source for crafters called etsy that you might check out.|`|HhXQnSznaa	Take pics and post them on ebay or craigslist to get reasonable money for them. It would be better on craigslist.org because it is local and you can show the authenticity before selling them. If you can't sell them, go to a pawn shop to get a really low price for them.

onvpwieHaa	I gotta agree with everything that Bajan Princess has said. <br>  <br>  I don't know which one is a bigger display of ignorance. You asking this highly offensive question (which means you had some belief that this statement might be true) or your friend telling you that women in Barbados like being abused is part of their culture.|`|36a3ynpJaa	Maybe she thinks of Tina Turner and Whitney Houston are good role models for her...<br>  <br>  When I was in the Dominican Republic, there was a Haitian woman being abused by her German boyfriend.   The way she dealt with it was she cut his head off with a pocket knife.  It's not a good idea to cross a Caribbean woman.|`|fv2GAAdPaa	Here we go again:<br>  <br>  what your friend said really angers me because how would she know anything about Barbadian women(females is she one?)<br>  <br>  Women are constantly abused by their partners and leave but then they go back to them again, YOUR friend seesm to be in the dark about reality because if you dont hear about it desnt mean that it doesnt happn ok?<br>  <br>  So you tell yuor friend to check statistics and see that domestic absue happens all over.<br>  <br>  Now to the real incident:<br>  <br>  We dont know for sure if Rihana and Chris Brown are back together(well u guys that is) so ppl stop the rumors until one of them comes out and tells yu the truth(if it ever happens) ok?<br>  <br>  Because Rihanna allegedly went back with him DOES NOT mean that Bajan women like being abused, didnt you and yuour friend hear that she gave him a good and well deserve beating and cussing too? or ya'll aint gine say that part? ppl just wanna spread what sounds bad to get news hats all.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bajan women DONT like being abused!<br>  <br>  Have a good day.<br>  <br>  =]<br>  <br>  Edit: To 'Highly Favored' on your last stupid comment to me about me contridicting myself: how was i doing so? i said she doesnt live here and she doesnt she only come to visit anyone with a brain would pick up what i meant. now what does that say about you? I meant i know where she USE to live when she was here)where she come to visit) as we all know she lives i the U.S.A.|`|lcj1AKt1aa	Why Rhianna went back with Chris Brown is her business. Obviously she loves him and have forgiven him. Couples always have their differences but some resolve them differently.  It is just because that they are public figures that what happen is all in the news. This is not the first time that people have have differences and it will not be the last. Obviously he is attending anger management counselling and is sorry for what he has done.  Nothing is wrong with she forgiving him.<br>  <br>  Barbadian women nor any other woman likes being abused. No one can put their hand on me and I am a Barbadian.  I know many other Bajan women that would not stand for that foolishness. On the other hand, there will be some that being abused but that happens all over the world.<br>  <br>  Was Whitney Houston or Tina Turner Barbadians? So it could not be a Barbadian culture thing.  Yes domestic violence is common here but it is all over the world.  That is why we have laws in place for the men who think that they born a child so big.<br>  <br>  Wannah men don't like to see the women getting through and that is what cause the jealousy.  Additionally, some men feel get too jealous when they see their women talking to other men.<br>  <br>  Both you and your friend could try putting wannah hand pun we and wannah would see who God wannah serving.|`|WL7nKDplaa	Excuse me? No, no, no. Your friend is being incredibly racist. No one enjoys being abused. <br>  <br>  And I am so sick of hearing about how weak Rihanna is. Are they in the situation? No. The reason she went back to him is the same reason I gave to the last person to ask this question. <br>  <br>  To understand what is going on in her head, you would have to understand what goes on in an abusive relationship. An abuser makes their victims feel stupid and worthless. They'll call names, be rude, make mean comments, etc. They play mind games until their victim feels like the attack was their fault. Maybe Rihanna was already feeling bad. Who knows what went wrong. If they were fighting and she said something she didn't really mean, she could feel like the attack was her fault and she deserved it. An abuser will make their victim feel like no one else will ever want them. As though if the victim leaves the abuser, they will be alone forever. <br>  <br>  It is reported that the two most dangerous times for a woman in an abusive relationship are when she leaves, and when she is pregnant. Rihanna could be afraid to leave. <br>  <br>  Also, after the bruises start to fade and the victim feels better, they often realize that they do still love the abuser and they go back. It's unfortunate, but it does happen. <br>  <br>  So is Rihanna stupid to go back to Chris, no I wouldn't use those words. Is it smart? No, definitely not. Is this our place to judge? No. Rihanna needs support right now, and hopefully she will realize that as much as she loves Chris, it is in her best interest to leave now.<br>  <br>  Now grow up, and stop being racist.|`|bgtNYOp5aa	It's not common there, and your friend is racist. She went back with him because she is weak, and not a good role model for women.|`|9Pdb92Xwaa	Uhhh....  If I were you, I would let everything that your friend says fall right out the other ear...  However, should you choose and listen to him be rest assured that I feel he will bring down your basic intelligence too.<br>  <br>  Barbadian women (that are in their right mind) do not put up with such nonsense.  In fact Barbadian women have the tendency of outperforming Bajan men in such critical areas as education ( <br>  <a href="http://www.unesco.org/education/wef/en-news/barbados.shtm" rel="nofollow">http://www.unesco.org/education/wef/en-n...</a> ). So too, many Barbadian households are strongly a matriarchal structure as well.  Barbadian women have made sizable inroads into the nation's politics.<br>  <br>  In case your friend doesn't know.  A women named Sarah Ann Gill is one of Barbados' 10 national heroes.<br>  <br>  In addition to that, both of Barbados' major political parties have divisions that advocate the issues that are important most to the female demographic.  This mainly includes gender empowerment for women.<br>  <br>  The DLP<br>  <a href="http://www.dlpbarbados.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=36" rel="nofollow">http://www.dlpbarbados.org/cms/index.php...</a><br>  <br>  The BLP (Note too-- the Government opposition leader here is a women too.)<br>  <a href="http://blp.org.bb/womens_league" rel="nofollow">http://blp.org.bb/womens_league</a><br>  <br>  As for your friend...  I feel sorry for your friends condition, but the Barbadian women are holding their own.  Perhaps he could have a Barbadian women come and educate him a little?|`|WfEol5xkaa	It's a stunt to get the charges dropped against Chris Brown, or to beat the prosecution's case. It might also be a bid to save his career.<br>  <br>  Rihanna will testify and say she started fighting with Brown and he had to defend himself, and that she is sorry.<br>  <br>  After all is said and done, she'll leave Brown again, as arranged by their lawyers and publicists.<br>  <br>  How dumb are you people?<br>  <br>  PS: Caribbean women are tough? What a joke.|`|xRUZkFU9aa	OK, so I'm not going to get my panties in a twist with this one...but YES domestic violence IS more common in some cultures than others.

I looked into the Ghan and it costs an awful lot of money just to sit on the train for 1.5 days from Alice Springs to Darwin. Most of what you will see is just desert. I would be more inclined to do a helicopter flight for the extra money. <br>  <br>  I would do the top end while I was at it. Unfortunatly I have time restraints so am only doing 8 days based from Darwin. We are doing a 4 day tour which goes to Kakadu, Katherine Gorge, etc.. We will probably do a day trip or two from Darwin as well. We booked the tour through the travel agent and saved a few hundred, but we too shopped around. <br>  <br>  In Alice Spring I would look at a trip out to Uluru, it's not real close, its out in the middle of nowhere. <br>  <br>  One big piece of advise, try and go in June or at latest July/August. They is the only real tourist season in the NT. The weather is just too damn hot and wet the rest of the year. I hope you don't want to go this year, most of the accommodation is gone. We are going the week before school holidays and booked in January and only got a room because we are accor members, for general online sales it was booked out. We could've got a room by other means but it would've cost $50 + extra. We are staying at the novotel. Medina also looks quite nice and is brand new. We looked at some other hotels but they were all so pricey. For location and quality the Novotel ranked as our favourite. <br>  <br>  I hope that is of some help to you. Hope you have a great trip.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	It's a good idea to get more than one quote . I recently went overseas and got about 5 quotes and finally went straight through booking with the airline.

But I am doing the 12 night I think it is, from Darwin through Kakadu, some places with warm springs called Manaranka or something down to The Rock where we do the early morning champagne balloon flight.<br>  <br>  On this trip you do NOT wear a white Tshirt, or new designer jeans or cloths, you will be totally roughing it. The accommodation till you get to Alice Springs I am told is like ti pee tents.<br>  <br>  This trip has been highly recommended to me, you get to see and do lots. However I got a sound warning, follow the instructions of the coach/bus captain/driver.

etV271ARaa	You ingat wrong lah bro. Samy was a bag man for Mahathir's cronies. Thats why our construction projects cost 400 and 500% higher than market prices. Samy did a lot for himself but we Indians didnt show any interest in politics as long as our poorer brothers were taken care of. He failed to do this. Basically, he did nothing for Indians. He and a few cronies pressured the Govt to give allocations to the Indian community like Telekom Malaysia & Tenaga preferred shares during the privatisation era. They then snapped it up for themselves. <br>  <br>  During the housing boom in the 80s a lot of plantation land was converted to residential. Also rubber crashed and no help was extended to the Indian plantation workers. No rehabilitation, no retraining, no compensation.... NOTHING. <br>  <br>  The Hindraf movement was established to address the demolition of temples, unemployment among Indians and the targetting of Indian youth by the police force. MIC refused to see them for over a year, forcing them to take the fight to Britian and to the streets. <br>  <br>  Barisan National has done NOTHING for Indians while for over 100 years rubber was the country's top and second top earner of revenue. All UMNO has done is bleed the nation dry by enriching themselves and pouring money into Malay issues, most of which are failures but Malaysia's revenue was earned from Tin, Rubber and Industry. The Chinese leadership have fought well for their people but MIC has done nothing<br>  <br>  So please, dont talk about that shark here.|`|0VYpCXz5aa	Most of the Indian support HINDRAF but not Samy Vellu.

etV271ARaa	Do you realise that the value of a nation's currency in linked to its financial health and social standards?<br>  <br>  Singapore's GDP is double that of Malaysia. Singaporeans feel a natural sense of belonging to their country. So they invest their savings back into the system. The govt pays it's civil servants well and sets high standards of employers. Singapore is ranking fifth in per capita income in the world. Everyone has money and although the cost of living is high, people are happy. Malaysians are underpaid and has a civil service of a single race in which corruption is one of the highest in the world.<br>  <br>  Corruption is not rampant there and any allegation of corruption is investigated. Here the ACA investigates 12% of the reports they get and prosecutes only 8% of that. That means for every 100 reports of corruption the ACA receives, only one gets to court. Maybe they win, maybe not.<br>  <br>  Singapore jealously upholds Judicial Independence. In Malaysia's case, when foreigners or multinational companies have a legal dispute against malaysians, they prefer to file judicial proceedings in singapore.<br>  <br>  Singapore has world class education while Malaysian students are personna non grata in Universities in Egypt (just an example) coz they take more than 12 years to complete a  4 year degree programme. Education is in English while here, people think the promotion of education in English constitutes a betrayal to race and nation.  <br>  <br>  There is free flow of capital. Foreigners can move funds in and out easily while its quite difficult to do so here. sing dollar is traded internationally while our ringgit can only be used internally. ALthough the Sing Dollar is loosely pegged to a basket of currencies, the singapore dollar is floated and international bankers can set a value to the sing dollar within the band. And they trade openly with the whole world. They also have very open policies towards international bankers are agree to most WTO arrangements. They also do not practice protectionism when setting trade policies so foreign investors have a level playing field.<br>  <br>  In 1967 when the sing dollar was first introduced, it was at par with the ringgit. It started to gain against the ringgit only in the eighties. It will continue to gain unless we too resolve to take the path of progress.|`|ASSbLOk6aa	I think that the world lost confidence in our government and our nation. look at yesterday's riot over the use of Malay for Math and science. The change was made 5-6 yrs ago, now we start to riot?<br>  <br>  What about all the slanderous statements made in the political scene?<br>  <br>  what about the unfriendly nature of our political leaders has towards the rest of the world?<br>  <br>  I think all this caused the ranking of Malaysia to drop in the area of confidence in the Financial and Business sector, There is nothing to do with Big or small country.

etV271ARaa	Hi Edward, I tried sending you a message but doesnt work. Just click on the Avatar and send me your email address & I'll send you some links you can use to research your interests. <br>  <br>  The Yen carry trade is basically borrowing Yen at zero interest, then converting it to local currency and depositting it in NZ, Oz, Brussels, Luxembourg etc at 5/6% returns PA. The Japanese central bank didnt mind and even encouraged it coz it kept their currency low and made kept exports cheap. Remember inflation and growth was flat for 10 years there.<br>  <br>  But drastic changes have taken place these last 6 months. Massive interest rate cuts and lots of funds pouring into the US coz their stock mart is really cheap and lots of treasury bills being issued by the US Govt. The Yen carry trade was bound to unwind coz banks began to call in their loans and lower interest rates made it no longer viable. So a sudden demand for Yen has pushed its value up.  <br>  <br>  watch this video on this <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGjghNmm_lU&fmt=18" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGjghNmm_...</a><br>  <br>  There are others at this link you can watch also.

z5fFoTMBaa	My advice to you, follow your wish of obtaining a Russian citizenship.|`|pm2EeEgiaa	Well, because Filipinos are culturally and ethnically more similar to Pacific Islanders. <br>  <br>  The Filipinos and all Pacific Islanders (Micronesians, Melanesians, and Polynesians) all originated from Austronesians - and their language are all quite similar (for example, the word "lima" for five - is the same in Filipino, Polynesian, Guamanian, Malay, and Maori).<br>  <br>  Their food are all similar (vegetable and seafood based staples), and their prehistoric religions (nature worship) are also all the same - both ancient Filipinos and ancient Polynesians had kahunas - women priests who perform exactly the same religious practices whether in the Philippines or in Polynesia.<br>  <br>  The ONLY reason they are classified as ASIAN is because they are in the continent of ASIA. If you look closely in their faces - at least those who are pure indigenous Philippine natives - they look a lot more like Pacific Islanders than Asians.<br>  <br>  With all these things said, since they reside in a part of the continent of Asia, politically, they are classified as ASIANS.|`|YALlJatBaa	I wish I was Russian, too.<br>  <br>  Especially this hero grandmaster in the musical "Chess".<br>  <br>  Ever heard of that song "Anthem" featured there?

6b37126c4f3eb7f5fd695fe30c781375aa	This isn't going to help you now, but next time you travel, plan ahead.  I'm not one to plan every second of my trip, but at least I find out what's there that I would like to do.  Be careful asking the locals what to do for fun - they could send you into a very bad situation.  Besides, what is acceptable fun for the locals isn't always recommended for tourists.  I've been to various places in Mexico and while some of it is absolutely wonderful, it can also be a very dangerous place for tourists who don't use their head.  One tip, if you are in a cab, make sure the doors are locked (including front seat) - a favorite tourist crime is for people to open the cab doors and rob you while stopped at a light (they are often working with the cab driver).  Better if you dress and look like you don't have all that much $.<br>  Enjoy!|`|gOyLBe1laa	Dude you have to go to Coco bongo nightclub, it's on downtown cancun, also there's another huge club called Laboom.

People complain about the water there but i spend 4 days there and can't remember thinking any water lol.|`|tvtZV32oaa	well all i can say is be VERY careful in cancun, dont drink the tap water, you can get very, very sick, buy lots of bottled water.<br>  sorry thats all i got =D|`|jHEs8KhAaa	WOW............ You are in for the time of your life.  You are in Cancun for spring break.  That is the best time to experience Cancun!  <br>  I'll start off first with tipping...  Just tip what you feel is appropriate.  If you make any attempt to tip someone in Cancun you are doing well.  I know travel agents say tipping is not allowed/encouraged, but they appreciate it.  Just think... while you are out having fun these people wait on you hand over foot... they work 16 hour days and feed their family of the money you give.  The Mexicans are great people that work hard, especially in Cancun, so tip them well.  If you give them a good tip they will treat you like a KING!<br>  As far as what you can expect..... You will see people being really drunk, lots of boobs, even public sex.  Spring Break in Cancun is basically one big drunken orgy.  You will see things and have stories to tell your grandchildren.... Cancun is off the hook!!!<br>  The main part of Spring Break is for college kids to come down from the US and get drunk and flash their boobs and the main goal is to have sex with as many people as you can.  <br>  As far as places to go....... You MUST go to Coco Bongo's.  It is the best club in Cancun and you will enjoy it very much.<br>  Also go to Senor Frogs... it's a bar and they have a waterslide inside so you can slide out from the bar into the lagoon.  <br>  Other places you need to visit are The City, Bulldogs, Dos Equis Bar, Dady O, Dady Rock, Corona Bar.  <br>  Basically, Cancun is like this...... you wake up and eat breakfast... then have some drinks by the pool or on the beach.... at about 5 p.m. everybody goes and gets ready to go out.... they eat dinner around 6-7.. then have some drinks in the hotel then they go out to the clubs till about 6 in the morning.<br>  You both will have the times of your life.  Please feel free to send me a message if you need to more.  If you want a great time you both need to go to Coco Bongo first and the rest will fall into play.  Coco Bongo's is the place to be in Cancun.... Enjoy your time... and again don't hesitate to contact me if you need anymore suggestions....<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't pay attention to the one guy that said La Boom.... LOL...

f5af79d31cc0946cad302ef0300bbe04aa	Hola.  Oh my gosh there are so many different places with so many different kinds of international cuisine.  It would be hard to list them all.<br>  <br>  If you get a chance go to the sunset di mona lisa.  It is by far the most beautiful, romantic and lovely restaurant.  Italian food and amazing atmosphere. <br>  <br>  Closer to your resort and if you like seafood then I highly recommend Lorenzillos, or closer to town 12 Tribes....but there are so many more places all along the marina that are worth a try.<br>  <br>  If you get a chance, some of the best restaurants are actually located in the town of San Jose del Cabo which is about 20 minutes away from Cabo.  They have Morgans, Baan Thai, Damiana, Tropicana, Matador, oh I could go on and on.  Plus the town itself is charming and rustic compared to the crazier Cabo.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|aX8nee8gaa	Was there 2 weeks ago. At the Marina Ole Ole was pretty good and No Worry's was average food, overpriced, very poor service and double charged credit card. The Original Park next to Lenny's was also incredibly slow and poor service and double billed credit card. Stay away from both of those. Romeo and Juliets in town was good italian, Ruths Chris at the marina is virtually a steal when you compare to how much the bad restaurants at the marina charged. The Office on the beach is very good, its a shame you won't be drinking!<br>  <br>  Many restaurants will not take Amex, that's a pretty good indication that they will try to cheat you. Also they like to bring you a bill with out an itemized receipt, make sure you get a detailed bill before you pay for anything. Always ask cab drivers for cost before you get in, they will pump the fee up when they drop you off if you don't. And watch the exchnage rate. Its about 15:1 right now, make sure you are getting 13.5:1 or better. If you are not then go somewhere else.|`|3UB7mSNwaa	Mi Casa (Frommers gave it a good rating) <br>  <br>  I ate there last Tuesday.<br>  <a href="http://www.micasarestaurant.com/home.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.micasarestaurant.com/home.php</a><br>  Got this for my first course<br>  <br>  Tostadas de Marlin Ahumado<br>  Tostadas loaded with smoked Cabo Marlin in an extremely tasty tomato & chipotle sauce .

Brick walled, outside dining available, busy, great food and drinks (for who ever joins you). Good atmosphere. Not a place for the loud or younger set, more refined than say Squid Roe.<br>  The other is at the Hacienda del Mar either under their huge palapa or on one of the ocean/beach front steps. It's pricey but their chef is quite the master in the kitchen...world renowned.  We had a three course lobster and steak dinner, wine, desert for under $140 USD. At sunset, with the waves breaking nearby, it was just awesome. After dinner, we stroille along the beach for a bit.

FBAmSYKKaa	Your wife must be a Filipina who wants to come back and take the local review. I know of many friends, relatives and family members who are in the academe or are students themselves or products of the universities and colleges in the country. Generally speaking, we have quite a big number of very good schools in the country but we do have the schools offering sub standard education, too. One has to be very selective in choosing the right school and the best review center. There will be many referrals from friends but based on the passing average of the board takers, one can easily target where to go for the kind of review you want. I still think that it's the individual's capacity to learn, commitment and diligence that is the biggest factor if you want to be a successful passer.|`|be6eed05c77e84c91810483266c1e72caa	Really great!

To date, the top three universities are University of the Philippines, De La Salle University and Ateneo. When it comes to medicine, however, the University of Santo Tomas is also quite good.

So that has to count for something.  <br>  <br>  However, I do know that they tell me than the profession of therapy is much different in the Pilippines...they are not really allowed to make decisions about treatment.  Rather, they almost function like physical therapy assistants do here.  Here's an example:<br>  <br>  I was recently treating a patient with back pain and his friend from the Philippines came to watch.  This young man watched our session.  During the session, I made my decisions about which exercises to give the patient based on the observations I made about his movement and symptomatic responses to exercises.  In otherwords, I was continually changing the program and modifying it.  The young observer said that in the Philippines, they cannot really do this, rather the doctor gives them different "cards" (thats the word he used) about what they can or cannot do. <br>  <br>  That being said, I would say that where Philippines tend to falter is with decision making.  This is a big focus of PT in the US and on the NPTE exam.  <br>  <br>  In my observation, the Filioppino community has geat health professional schools, and I think they generally make great therapists and have excellent hands on skills, they have great knowlege about precautions and medical situations...but for those who are new to the US or have difficulty passing the NPTE is because they do not have the background on being the deicision maker.  As this young man told me, they are used to "being told what to do."<br>  <br>  Most of the Filippinos I know went to the University of Santo Thomo
e90176c07b1407c7ff422c7f67eba392aa	Ramadan is the only time I ever feel like I live in a Muslim country. During that time, most restaurants outside of hotels are closed. I believe most of the restaurants in the hotels are in full operation.<br>  <br>  Many fast food restaurants have a takeaway counter for the day. There are restaurants outside of hotels that are open, but they must be completely not visible to people on the street (closed windows, etc). To be honest, I've heard that these exist, but I've never actually eaten in a restaurant that was open during Ramadan outside of the hotels.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, when in Dubai, you tend to spend most of your day outside of your hotel (often in the mall, around which it seems that modern Dubai life revolves). That can make it a bit difficult. You're not even technically allowed to eat in your car. Places like waterparks and beaches become problematic when you're not allowed to eat all day.<br>  <br>  Most of the public tends to just reverse their schedules during Ramadan rising late and sleeping late. Most shopping centers and restaurants are open until way past midnight.<br>  <br>  Personally, if I were a tourist, I'd avoid Dubai during Ramadan. In fact, even as a resident, I take a holiday and leave the country during that time.

No one, no one, no one can possibly tell you enough about NYC for you to write a novel if you have never been here. <br>  <br>  Indeed, I would not suggest that you attempt what you say you are doing if you have not actually LIVED here for a long time. <br>  <br>  NYC is too dense and complicated a place for a person to just hear about and write a story about.<br>  <br>  I'll tell you what I frequently tell young people who want to write about NYC (but don't actually live here) - write about what you know. Write about where YOU are from. Write about your own experiences. DON'T write about places you don't know. You will only end up looking foolish!|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Oh, it's not a good idea to set a novel in a place you've never been.

f5af79d31cc0946cad302ef0300bbe04aa	Hola.  The ME Melia Cabo San Lucas is one of our more popular resorts for those who want to party and be close to downtown Cabo.  Located on the party beach (Medano) it is well worth that convenience itself!  Some people do get it confused with the Me Melia Real that is out on the corridor and you will often hear bad reviews, but its only because they think they are talking about the ME in Cabo.  I've never heard a bad review.  I go there often to meet with clients and we hang out on the beach chairs and its a great place.  Rooms look nice too.|`|AA10042296	Click the link below and read 122 reviews of the ME Cabo written by other travelers who stayed there.|`|bf6K6uubaa	I have had friends relay bad experiences from that hotel...good thing is that is in a prime location to party and be in all  the action...bad thing is you're literally in the action...I heard they play loud music til 4 am every day...which can be bad if you're not trying to party like an animal all week.  But if you're young and into the girls gone wild spring break thing its an option for you.  Also the drinks and water are super pricey there...talking 4 dollars for water and 10-15 for a drink.  My friends got over charged every day they were there on their credit card so I'd say pay cash ONLY...also heard it was hard to find seats at the pool.  Just depends on what you're looking for.  You also won't have to pay cabs or rent a car to get to the clubs at night cause you're already in the area.

uKWcgLLoaa	Portland just made it to the top of the list of "most miserable cities in the US." Not sure exactly why because I've always found it to be pleasant. But you might want to keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  Additionally, Seattle has often made it to the top of "most livable big cities in the US." Besides the beauty of its natural surroundings, you will never run of things to do in the Seattle area. (Same might be true for Portland, though!)<br>  <br>  If weather is an issue at all, you might keep in mind that it is more moderate in Seattle (less hot in the summer, less cold in the winter, and less rain on an annual basis.)<br>  <br>  I'd choose Seattle, but I think Portland is a good choice as well.

hT7BhNamaa	Ellie your paying for the excess luggage or weight I guess, if it gets to that. If you have food stuff of any sort, my advice to you, specially when you reach Australia is declare, they take a very dim view of that sort of thing, they, I mean the Quarantine and Customs people. Do the right thing as they say if in doubt you can approach them and ask, your better off doing that than concealing, and have to undergo a strip search.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|RbmfJX5gaa	LMAO !!!! Are you serious ????<br>  <br>  If they fit in a bag they will be fine. The sniffer dogs might tear their heads off otherwise. <br>  <br>  It really doesn't matter what type of bears they are either. They are all allowed to enter the country.|`|NuUMDTrTaa	The chocolate scented bears will set the sniffer dogs off, so it would be wise to carry that as hand luggage so you don't have to unpack your other bags, ALTHOUGH, if the dogs do sniff them, you probably will get pulled aside in Australia for a full bag search and extra luggage x rays. They will also do drug scans of your luggage to see if you have been carrying drugs.<br>  Your really safe bet would be to leave the chocolate bears behind, or send them on by mail, with a description of what they are on the outside. They will still get picked by the sniffer dogs, but all they will do is X ray them to see if there is anything hidden inside.|`|ZA18KoC9aa	Yes- you can bring them for comfort and happiness!|`|s2IOyj8iaa	Your bears will enjoy the trip .

Trams cost and if you have a fear of tight closed spaces, you might sweat a bit getting up there. Hint..you might have a long wait for your tram so buy timed tickets as soon as you get there and then walk around the museum. In windy weather the arch does sway at the top but you're in no danger. The biggest thing lacking is no restaurant. The closest is downtown St. Louis or Lacledes Landing. My suggestion would be as you leave the arch eat at one of the restaurants in nearby Soulard and then take a free brewery tour.

Their biggest complaints are a bit of a lack of stores (Walgreens closed and Schnucks isnt open yet) and the pan handlers on the street. My biggest drawback is that I have to pay to park when I go to visit them.<br>  Personally, I'd have no problem moving there if I was single.

90tPT5nlaa	University of Newcastle, University of NSW, University of Wollongong are the uni's closest to the beach in NSW.|`|xs2mpYjWaa	The University of Wollongong located 1.5 hours south of Sydney in the 2nd biggest city in New South Wales. <br>  <br>  The university is in North Wollongong and would be only 20mins drive to the beach and that's only coz the roads don't go straight there. Most uni students live in North Wollongong also, part of which has ocean views and a few minutes walk to the beach. The whole area of Wollongong is based along the coast with some of the worlds best beaches. <br>  <br>  As a international student you will need to pay full fee (higher then the Australian full fee as ours is subsidised) and in advance, there is no deferment available. You could be paying $10,000 a year for tuition plus all the other costs. If you are part of the masters program it will cost more and everyone has to pay up front. <br>  <br>  Here is the website for international students at the UOW. It also has a list of prices. <a href="http://www.uow.edu.au/prospective/international/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uow.edu.au/prospective/intern...</a>|`|YQYMPGK3aa	there are some university's on the gold coast (Griffith and Bond i think)<br>  <br>  also one on the sunshine coast (university of sunshine coast)|`|LyTdvmZ9aa	Well there is a great university in Brisbane. It's called Griffith, that's the one I want to go to. And only about an hour's drive or two from the sunshine coast!
3k2NjOWsaa	In the bag that you are checking, you can put any amount of liquids/gels/aerosols.  The only restriction is the liquids which have to be in a quart bag and the containers must be 3 oz. each or less.  You can pack 100 cans of hairspray and it would be okay.  (well to tell you the truth they might get a little suspicious if it's that much)<br>  <br>  lol....hope i helped!!!|`|7sA8HwTzaa	You can, but be mindful of the weight restrictions for baggage.  Go one ounce over and it could cost you an extra $90!  Try to bring smaller sizes of those things.|`|xRYqhzKxaa	That's perfectly fine! Liquids are only restricted for carry ons. Have at it with your hairspray! :)

D57Ggwajaa	hi! i'm acctualy an exchange student in Italy, i'm officially going to stay with my host family in Caserts, italy, in September! So i"ll do my best to help you with the sign-ups and stuff.<br>  <br>  first of all, you have to be 16 usually to go on exchange trips, if you just want to do summer, the rules might be slightly different.<br>  <br>  hands down, ASSE is the best, safest, and cheapest organization out there. the people are helpful and it has passed all government related tests. go to www.asse.com for more info<br>  <br>  usually, summer trips have you moving around to different places with a group of other Americans on the same program as you. you might stay with one family for a week or more and then move on. <br>  <br>  if you want a real host family and a real exchange trip go for a semester or a year! <br>  <br>  if you have any more questions you can email me!|`|gC7OMToraa	<a href="http://afs.org/afs_or/home" rel="nofollow">http://afs.org/afs_or/home</a><br>  I got this from my school.<br>  <br>  Buona giornata :)|`|QxtdyNvgaa	no i dont know<br>  i want to help you but i dont know the answer<br>  tough!|`|7RJwE5ohaa	Rotary Youth (summer) exchange.<br>  <br>  Just google "rotary youth exchange" and look for a rotary club near your town.|`|224a7eaaf46eec4d949ffc56fb6e1c6faa	check with the lion`s club or the rotary club, but maybe 13 is a little young - check with your school if they have students exchange -
eGiLYNlzaa	Make sure you bring an emoty gas can for just in cases. My family took about a straight 23 hour driving to get from Atlanta to New York last summer, and that was without stopping anywhere except for rest stops. Stock up on food and take lots of pictures! Good luck

AA11216883	sidestep.com<br>  kayak.com|`|VxfyQZ2jaa	There is no secret, magic website with the "cheapest" airfares.  You have to do the research, and be as flexible as possible regarding travel dates.<br>  <br>  Check the travel sites (airgorilla, expedia, priceline, travelocity, etc.) and also check the airline websites. I have usually (not always, but usually) found the best fares on the airline websites. Remember to check airlines like JetBlue and Southwest that do not use the travel sites.<br>  <br>  Check with a real travel agent to ask about promotional fares and special deals.<br>  <br>  If you also need a hotel or rental car, check the cost of combining the purchases in a package.  For example, I found a deal with airfare + hotel in Hawaii for a week that was only $100 more than just the airfare.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  |`|AA12122835	It would depend where you are in the USA, and which other state you need to fly to.  I have found best deals with Airtran and Allegiant Airways, but I always shop around with <a href="http://www.bookingbuddy.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookingbuddy.com</a> and then check for low-cost airlines, like Allegiant and <a href="http://www.southwest.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.southwest.com</a>  since those don't participate in other booking sites.|`|NATLQNTLaa	kayak.com will show you the available fares from just about all the airlines.<br>  <br>  Prices change all the time though - you could also try yapta.com who will try & get you a rebate if they can find the same flight cheaper than you purchased it for.|`|2woC2m2Waa	Try these, www.expedia.com, www.cheapoair.com, www.priceline.com, www.orbitz.com.

xIHgTqVhaa	Is he already on something? Why wont the doctor give him anything? <br>  <br>  Remember, even though it's "natural", doesn't make something automatically harmless. I would not give any sort of medication against doctor's advice and remember that all meds, natural or not, are stronger in the air (including the beer you may want by the time drinks are ordered lol!)<br>  <br>  Px medications are allowed on board, and are allowed over 3oz (the usual limit for liquids). Pills are not a problem IF you end up carrying anything on board.  <br>  <br>  Some things that might help are;<br>  -avoid overly sugary things or anything with caffeine<br>  -electronic toys often exacerbate this problem so perhaps leave them at home or check them <br>  -have a big talk with him beforehand, also with the parents. Get tips on how they discipline and calm him, also what you should avoid doing. <br>  <br>  Bring books to read to him and plenty of things to do with his hands, play dough, puzzles, toys you have to put together, etc. <br>  <br>  Get a book on flying from the library and either you or the parents read it to him so he knows what to expect. <br>  <br>  Please have someone talk to him about security, which could set him off. It can be intimidating even for a veteran flier, let alone a first timer with ADHD;<br>  <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/children/index.shtm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/c...</a><br>  <br>  You may want to bring your own food or order a special meal for him. Have plenty of healthy snacks he likes so that you're not dealing with a cranky child, as well as one who has ADHD! <br>  <br>  I'm a former Flight Attendant from a medical family and here are my non-commercial flying tips, if there's anything in there that can help.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://flyingwithchildren.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://flyingwithchildren.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  I've had hyper children on my flights and nothing dramatic ever happened. Boys that age, in general, like flying so the distraction of the new experience might actually work in your favor. <br>  <br>  Good luck and hope it goes smoothly. |`|eulMjLtPaa	Even if the doctor "won't give him anything," she might recommend some natural herbs or teas.  This is really too important (and possibly dangerous) to leave to the advice of strangers.  |`|qTK8ffaUaa	Does he take medication for his ADHD? You might have his mom or dad contact his physician to see if there is something that can taken with his regular meds if he is in fact on medication. Good Luck!|`|7mHlDzn9aa	Whats his age? 
17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	FYI: Pleasanton is in the San Francisco bay area, not in Los Angeles.|`|fsHiTfh3aa	Irvine is basically a suburban area.  Close to LA but quite boring otherwise.  Very safe and good weather. <br>  <br>  Pleasanton (which is not near LA) is similar.  But it is closer to San Francisco, and a bit colder in the winter.  <br>  <br>  New York is a big, high-energy city like London.  Boston is a bit smaller.  Both can get very cold.|`|631kHi2yaa	Are you British? I would choose NYC as I am British and have been there 3 times and love it and you CAN find cheap food shops in Soho, Harlem and in the meat packing district west of Chelsea. NYC is safe now.|`|Ptsc8YPRaa	be advise that Pleasanton is NO where near Los Angeles<br>  its closer to San Francsico then Los Angeles<br>  that would a very long commute! about 7 hours |`|d12a585a9f486535d07b0683ef24b00eaa	it all depends on what you want. Cali is way overrated. boston might be nice  if you can get past those boston accents.|`|4e911a1a92f0524d87554578ea0e7544aa	Irvine is the safest city in the US. The Angels play near by, as do the Ducks. Lots of young people.
fsHiTfh3aa	LA's public transportation system is fairly weak, although it is being expanded.  If you live downtown or in Hollywood, you may be able to get by without a car.  But in other places, you'll need  a car.|`|lzEuuseJaa	Chances are you would need a car in LA. You can use public transportation but you'd have to be very specific about where you'd live and work. I do know quite a few people who use public transportation in LA, but it's not an option for all. <a href="http://www.walkscore.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.walkscore.com/</a>  You can check out walkability of LA neighborhoods. But if you consider overall quality of living for money spent - LA beats NY. By far. I LOVE NY, but the cost is far more than in LA for the same standard of living. <br>  <br>  While people think NY has cleaner air than LA, it sure feels dirtier to me, and I'm not comparing to the beach in LA, but places like Pasadena. Asthma rates in some areas of NY are likely the highest in the country.<br>  <br>  Come to LA and give it a try for a couple of weeks. But be ready to stay. That's what's happened to quite a few of my NY friends. = )|`|VorZ6if8aa	I personlly would go for NYC. I have been before- I do not live there but I love it.Its more of a city city.  To me LA always gives the impression it is trying to be something it isn't.Try and visit both places and see.At the end of the dayyou just have to jump in.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	No, in LA you need a car and it's not going to be cheap either.<br>  <br>  Stay in NYC! You're a lot happier there.<br>  But feel free to come visit L.A.|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	Don't you love it when people who have no idea what they are talking about give opinions based on nothing - for a place they have never lived. I have lived in both cities and like them both. You can get around LA without a car, that is a myth. It might take longer - but thousands do it every day. And LA is just as multicultural as NY - it has a more varied culture actually. Don't go by TV shows for goodness sakes.<br>  <br>  The person who was ranting about Central park has obviously never heard of Griffith Park which is much larger  - Griffith is  4,210 acres, Central Park is only 843 acres. Griffith park is one of the largest urban parks in the US.  LA also has lots of other parks and beaches galore.<br>  <br>  I do find it odd that you would base where you live on a radio station. It's just a radio station. <br>  <br>  Flip a coin.|`|vTlGEKUeaa	I reccomend LA.<br>  I go to California every summer to visit my gramma and i love it!<br>  I also went to New York last summer and i did not like it very much. It is wayyy over rated. Besides from the shopping, the statue of liberty, museums and town square, it is just an overpopulated stinky dirty city. <br>  In my opinion...<br>  <br>  & you can always walk to with the weather so great in Cali!<br>  great excersise:)|`|8UMixj7paa	I have lived in LA for 25 years if you love traffic and smog then you will be OK, freeways are always jammed day or night average commute time in rush hour is 1 hours what a waste of time. Do not worry about radio stations there are more then 23 you will find the one you like.|`|631kHi2yaa	Stay in NYC! Cheap transportation and better fish shops in Soho and the meat packing district has cheap supermarkets next to Chelsea.<br>  <br>  Too much smog in LA so you will suffer! Central Park, there is no such place in LA and LA is too big anyway. And too many crazy people in California!|`|KLot8fc9aa	LA for sure. Much nicer on the west coast, but thats me, good luck,. Get a nice gas saving small car, you`ll be glad you did. People can comute with you, if you like. I personally love LA. Especially  the beach! |`|NbNG4F2eaa	Stay in NYC! In LA you NEED a car! |`|d12a585a9f486535d07b0683ef24b00eaa	aint sure?  Flip a coin!<br>  <br>  ps radio sux big time in los angeles|`|XxL9oXGoaa	yeah u can take the bus and metro in la u dont need a car either.|`|K7GqSPzBaa	LA beachh babyy(: <br>  nice weatherr.<br>  hot guys/girls.<br>  lol oh & get a ipod?<br>  |`|U9bQgfY9aa	Compared to New York LA has fantastic weather. I would not live any where else. But unless you plan to live and work downtown, you need a car. Period.<br>  <br>  And you can still listen to your favorite radio station streaming on line. Besides, LA has something like 100+ radio stations too. You will find something.<br>  <br>  |`|17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	The public transportation system in the Los Angeles area is no where equal to that of NYC. It is designed for daytime commuters, with spotty night time service, and using it to go from place to place can be very time consuming. I think you'll be happier living in NYC, but that shouldn't stop you from coming out for a week or two to see what L.A. is like.

3Wxx2FPkaa	Paris is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, with 45 million tourists every year in the Paris Region, 60% of whom are foreign visitors.There are numerous iconic landmarks among its many attractions, along with world-famous institutions and popular parks.<br>  <br>  One of the best value and most convenient ways to see the sights of Paris is with the Paris Museum Pass (previously known as Carte Musées et Monuments), a pre-paid entry card that allows entry into over 70 museums and monuments around Paris and comes in 2-day (€30), 4-day (€45) and 6-day (€60) denominations (prices as of August 2008). The card allows you to jump otherwise sometimes lengthy queues and is available from participating museums, tourist offices, Fnac branches and all the main Métro and RER train stations. You will still need to pay to enter most special exhibitions. <br>  <br>  Note that most museums and galleries are closed on either Monday or Tuesday - check ahead to avoid disappointment! - and most ticket counters close 30 - 45 minutes before final closing. Louvre museum is closed on Tuesdays while Orsay museum is closed on Mondays, good to know when setting visit plans. <br>  <br>  Also consider the Paris Pass also a pre paid entry card + queue jumping to 60 attractions including The Louvre, The Arc de Triomphe, as well as a river cruise and allows free metro & public transport travel. Also note a cheaper alternative with this new combined pass available since September 2008 is the Paris ComboPass, which comes in Lite/Premium versions. <br>  <br>  All national museums are open free of charge on the first Sunday of the month; note, however, that this may mean long lines and crowded exhibits. Keep away from Paris during Easter week. It's really crowded. People have to queue up at the Eiffel tower for several hours. Entry to the permanent exhibitions at city-run museums is free at all times (admission is charged for temporary exhibitions). <br>  <br>  These listings are just some highlights of things that you really should see if you can during your visit to Paris. The complete listings are found on each individual district page (follow the link in parenthesis). <br>  <br>  Good listings of almost everything to do in Paris can be found in 'Pariscope' or 'Officiel des spectacles', weekly magazines listing all concerts, art exhibitions, films, stage plays and museums. Available from all kiosks. <br>  <br>  You can go around by car, on foot, by metro, by boat, on skates, by bicycle, by bus or taxi, (lot of traveling options)<br>  <br>  In the parts of the city that tourists frequent the most (Tour Eiffel, Le Louvre, Champs-Elysées), the shopkeepers, information booth attendants, and other workers are likely to answer you in English, even if your French is advanced. These workers tend to deal with thousands of foreign-speaking tourists, and responding in English is often faster than repeating themselves in French. This is not the case for the rest of the city. <br>  <br>  Visa application may not take more than 3-4 days.<br>  <br>  The decsent people like decency> You are representing your country in France, so be careful and manage to take and use proper dress ( Suit with tie)

luWMdsrOaa	As is well known, the historical relationship between the Jews and Jerusalem goes back to the reign of David when the city served as the royal centre that united the disparate tribes. However, what really invested Jerusalem with spiritual significance for the Jewish people was the construction of the Temple by Solomon that gave the city its special sanctity as the place with which God chose to uniquely associate His Holy Name (Deuteronomy Ch.12 v.5). That location -  The Temple Mount, is thus considered to have been made intrinsically holy - in fact the only real Holy Site for Judaism. For that reason, in the absence of the Temple rites for ritual purification and the precise knowledge of the exact place of the holy of holies, Orthodox Jewish teaching prohibits Jews from entering today on to the site where the Temple itself once stood.  (One might note in passing, that as a result Judaism not only poses no current threat to Islamic  religious control on the Temple Mount, but in fact helps safeguard it!). Accordingly the holiness of Jerusalem is first and foremost, the emanation of sanctity from the Temple Mount which gives the whole City a sanctity greater than anywhere else beyond it. When the Temple was standing the children of Israel were obliged to go up to Jerusalem in pilgrimage three times a year (Deuteronomy Ch. 16 v.16 & 17). Jerusalem thus served as the focus of the spiritual unity and purpose of the people (see Psalm 122). Accordingly Jews continue today as in the past, to face towards Jerusalem for their prayers three times a day.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Jewish Tradition ascribes seventy names to Jerusalem, some of which are better known than others. There are those that are mentioned explicitly in Scriptures, such as Zion; Scriptural names which are identified as Jerusalem, such as Moriah; and many descriptive titles of Tradition attesting to her spiritual significance and beauty. In addition to the rich body of religious literature extolling Jerusalem's physical and spiritual virtues, the city is associated with central religious events in human history, starting with Creation itself. The foundation stone, "even hashetiyah", was not only at the centre of the Temple, but was considered the centre of the world from whence Creation had commenced and the place from which the earth for the creation of the first human being was taken. Jerusalem is also identified with events in the life of the Patriarchs. Most notable of all in this regard, the supreme Pentateuchal example of dedication to God; namely, Abraham's willingness to sacrifice to God that which was more precious for him than life itself - his son and heir. The place of Jacob's dream (which he had on his journey from home when fleeing from his brother Esau) in which he received Divine revelation and promise, is also identified by Jewish tradition with this site. Moreover in Judaism, Jerusalem acquires further cosmic significance both as the Divine footstool underneath God's throne (and thus as the natural fulcrum, as it were, of spiritual energy in the world) and also as a mirror image of the Heavenly Jerusalem that will eventually be united with the earthly Jerusalem. This global image finds its ultimate expression in the messianic hope for the ingathering of the exiles and universal peace with the establishment of the Divine Kingdom on Earth. <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Accordingly, when the Jewish people was in exile, Jerusalem served as the focus of their prayers and dreams for restoration, to the extent that both in prophetic and Rabbinic literature, Jerusalem became a symbol and personification not only of the land, but of the people itself. These hopes, that placed their trust in Divine mercy and promise, found their expression in the three daily prayer services and in grace after every meal. Perhaps the most poignant and succinct of these prayers is the blessing that we continue to recite after the Scriptural readings in the Sabbath morning service. "Have mercy on Zion, O Lord, for she is the house of our life. And deliver the grieving soul (i.e. the people of Israel) speedily in our days. Blessed art Thou O Lord who makes Zion rejoice with her children". Recognition of the unequaled sanctity of Jerusalem was maintained in Jewish religious consciousness as it continues to be today, through restricting certain prayers and religious rituals to Jerusalem alone, thus heightening the ideal of living in the city. However, many who were unable to realise this goal were sent for burial in Jerusalem (mainly on the Mount of Olives), both so that their final resting place should be on holy ground and above all to await the ultimate messianic resurrection at the center stage of those final events.|`|eneLtkY1aa	marry w, have another sip of kool-aid. <br>  <br>  Jerusalem was the Eternal Capital of Israel, The Kingdom of David and Solomon, long before the warmongering muslims and their leader Muhammad, pestilence be upon him, invaded.|`|6G5EvkbFaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Jerusalem" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_...</a>|`|ZbdvcKm2aa	<a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=history+of+jerusalem" rel="nofollow">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=history+of+jerusale...</a>|`|Fb519XJgaa	Jerusalem is significant to Jews, Christians and Muslims.<br>  To say it is more significant to the Jews like saying both Christians and Muslims do not exist.

In Islam, telling a lie to infidels for the sake of enlarging your own believers' faith or defeating the infidel is acceptable, even desirable.  <br>  <br>  The Land of Israel belongs to the Jewish People.

The book estimates the total population of the city at 60,000, of whom 7,000 were Muslims, 13,000 were Christians and 40,000 were Jews.  <br>  <br>  Jewish leaders urged the Arabs to remain in Palestine and become citizens of Israel.  The Assembly of Palestine Jewry issued this appeal on October 2, 1947: <br>  "We will do everything in our power to maintain peace, and establish a cooperation gainful to both [Jews and Arabs].  It is now, here and now, from Jerusalem itself, that a call must go out to the Arab nations to join forces with Jewry and the destined Jewish State and work shoulder to shoulder for our common good, for the peace and progress of sovereign equals."<br>  <br>  The Arab National Committee in Jerusalem, following the March 8, 1948, instructions of the Arab Higher Committee, ordered women, children and the elderly in various parts of Jerusalem to leave their homes: Any opposition to this order...is an obstacle to the holy war...and will hamper the operations of the fighters in these districts (Morris, Middle Eastern Studies, January 1986).  Morris also documented that the Arab Higher Committee ordered the evacuation of several dozen villages, as well as the removal of dependents from dozens more in April-July 1948.  The invading Arab armies also occasionally ordered whole villages to depart, so as not to be in their way.<br>  <br>  That is the long and short of it<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|ymXlF9Rnaa	<a href="http://www.eretzyisroel.org/~jkatz/templemount.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.eretzyisroel.org/~jkatz/templ...</a>|`|czdCtTvWaa	It is not important to the Jews.|`|iUL0GU3paa	its one of the things they stole from palestine....

Anyway, you have already answered your question.  Only the students that belong to a fancy family  can get an easy life here but I'm not trying to make you think that only the rich people can have a fancy life because the truth is most Filipinos are 'choosy' when it comes to job searching.  There are so many jobs available but one of the problems is job mismatch meaning they have finished college but the requirements of the job are not suitable for their expertise.  Also I have to point out that many college graduates are not qualified to graduate but they can still walk on the stage and get their diplomas.  Sounds strange?  It's true!  But when you have determination and perseverance and equipped with the right knowledge, I can safely say that you will be able to get through with life.|`|KXKTWbl9aa	only part true. some poor can also go to college. on scholarships.|`|kSt1BI6vaa	A lot of male college students become rent boys for gays. This is true.|`|NXBmcEz7aa	Your Mommy knows a lot about the Philippines.  Ask her for more!|`|alN2JxuUaa	There are lots of good colleges and universities here in the Philippines.<br>  <br>  Somehow, you are correct.  Most good universities are expensive thats why only those who can afford can enroll.  But there are scholarship grants for these universities and somehow being poor is not and should not be a reason.<br>  <br>  Most of the employers prefer graduates from top universities since they have this notion that they are better but this is not always the case. I do not believe that you need connections to get employed, in every application everyone is given a fair chance, those that are not well oriented in preparing a good resume are not shortlisted, well most of them came from "not-so-good" colleges and universities.<br>  <br>  Its more of preparing an amazing CV and a cover letter to catch the interest of an employer.
