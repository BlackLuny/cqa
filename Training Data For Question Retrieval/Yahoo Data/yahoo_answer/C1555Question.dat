20060630070712AA6RtVY	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, is killing an animal a sin?	If you kill a baby deer, will you go to Hell?  Is it considered murder?  Even if hunting was ok, what if you didn't eat it and just left it to suffer, would that be a sin?   If so, is killing a spider considered a sin too?  Where is the barrier with animal killing, is it cute vs. icky?   Spiders are helpful in getting rid of other insects, but I don't like them.  Sometimes I kill them by flushing them down the toilet, but other times I spray stuff on them to watch them die.  Any Christians do this?  Do you fear for your soul?

20060707131348AAMB8UR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why does the name of Jesus creates so much conflict at the point of kill each other?	Today, people can accept they believe in God and under the unspecific name of GOD many people can join together as muslims and jews and christians. But why when someone says I believe in Jesus, people starts rejecting that person even offending him. This is like the matrix movie, we live in a world where we act we live but we dont know anything about the meaning or the purpose of ourselves in this life, and nobody ask theirselves am I living the truth of my life or is there something that I should know about my existence. I'm a believer and I'm pretty sure that right now you are feeling something negative against myself. I wont ask what can we do to make poverty history as the Millionair Bono guy with his ironic question: look at me I have so much money and I'm asking you what can we do to stop poverty...well I guess that his answer is in his bank account or in his pocket. But think about my question why do YOU (if so) would reject someone who believe in Jesus.   Thank you all !!!

If they are Baptist, they will force their child to go to a Baptist church...is this right?        Finally, Fundamentalists will tell their children that they are going to hell if they do not believe as they do...if they do not turn from their sins, etc...isn't this an act of torture...say, if the kid is gay?  This treatment has caused many gay kids to commit suicide.... Shouldn't the fundamentalist be held accountable for harrasing the child, etc...      This is only for example...if the fundamentalist will love the child they, along with gay people should be allowed to adopt...there are too many unloved children in this world

There is a conspiracy among scientists to only pay attention to evidence that supports evolution and to ignore evidence that goes against it.      Did you know that they found tools and pottery that were dated to be about 50 million years old?      Also, if you look at a fossil of a shrimp that is tens of millions of years old, it looks EXACTLY the same as a modern shrimp.       The same thing goes for fish. They look the same too. They have not changed one bit.      The "theory" of evolution states that animals are CONSTANTLY evolving, so shrimp cannot look the same as they did millions and millions of years ago. You think the conditions were the same back then? Of course not.      So, logically speaking, the shrimp should have evolved, but they didn't. Why?      Because evolution is not true. You have to be an idiot to buy into that lie.      Agree?

No matter the cause- miscarriage, stillbirth, SIDS, health issues, or otherwise- the impact this tiny person has on your heart and on your life will stay with you forever.  There is no "getting over" the death of your child.        As bereaved parents many of us do specific things to honor our children's memory:  planting a tree or flowers, donating momentos to your local hospital for newly bereaved parents, donating books for your library on grief and loss, or even voluteering your time at a local children's shelter...      There is no "guide book" to follow after you lose a much wanted and very loved baby, there are no "rules" for grief- no right or wrong in how you honor the child who has passed away.      Please share with us your thoughts and ideas- you may be able to help a parent who has had their heart broken and dreams shattered by this devastating loss.

Los ni?os carecen de conocimientos sólidos para interpretar objetivamente la realidad; su mundo se forma con explicaciones fantásticas - lo mismo da cuentos de hadas que superhéroes o dioses- La diferencia es que, mientras los padres se esfuerzan en explicar que las hadas y los superheroes no existen, intentan convencerlos de la existencia de dios. Por lo que cuando se desarrollan las habilidades objetivas, algunos seres inteligentes se aferran a la creencia en su divinidad, corrigiendo, reinterpretando y a veces hasta disculpando a su dios. las creencias limitan la libertad y la individualidad humanas, atentan contra el espíritu humano y lo reducen a un simple objeto de barro.      Es por ello que considero que para que exista una verdadera libertad de creencias, la religión debería ense?arse solo cuando el prospecto haya adquirido las habilidades para interpretar y reconocer la diferencia entre lo real y lo mitológico.      ?que opinan al respecto?

Matt-ch 12:40 "For, as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the Fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth". This is supposed to be when Jesus was in the tomb for 3 days and 3 nights - but was it 3 days and 3 nights? Let's count:  Friday night is 1 night, Saturday is 1 day, Saturday night is 1 night, Sunday morning he was out of the tomb. We have 2 nights and 1 day, not three days and three nights. If, however, you want to tell me Friday, Saturday, Sunday are the three days, I will add Friday night and Saturday night - this makes 3 days, but only 2 nights. No way out. What do you think? But please don't tell me the Jews consider 3 days and 3 nights as 3 days or some other funny period of time. Let's stick to the facts.

Anne my friend went to the store to make copies of her great uncle priest who became a saint from the 1900's. She told me she would give me a copy. At the end of th evening, all was forgotten, and I asked her didn't you want to give me the copy of picture. She hesitated and gave it to me.    In the past she would give me gifts like candy and then ask me if she could have some and then proceed to eat it all. Or she would give me a gift and call me a couple times and say where's the gift what did you do with it? What room is it in? And this would make me feel creeped out like she didn't want me to have the gift, like her intentions were not true.    So my Q is, what do I do with this holy photo. I feel ill at ease having it because it is her great uncle's picture and the way she is about gifts and so forth, I FEEl she does NOT give from the heart and wants them back for some reason.     Should I send this photo to a church, throw it away or what? Your thoughts please. I do not want to send it back to her as it would be insulting. thanks.

Although she is hilarious and nice, she is physically very very overweight and not very cute.

I have tried including her in the conversation when a guy approaches me, but all he does is say hi and direct the conversation toward me. She looks very jealous and gets very quiet when this happens, so when guys do this to me, I ignore them, and don't talk to anyone but her. Honestly though, it may sound selffish, but I go out just about once a month- once every 2 months because of school, and so I like to have a good time, and I would like to talk to guys.

And seriously, if its so much for the boys, i have to live my life with them every single day. Sometimes, even in the same table. And never did i have any sort of eye-eye with them, they are just not like that. And my school has enough animalish girls for the boys to go for. So i'm safe as long as i act right and think twice. You think its ok? I thought, its going to happen once in my whole life time, and when i turn sixteen 2 months later bang i have to concentrate on my life more, and suffer at university and things.

20070125193728AALCtOU	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	?Tienes Fe?	Mi pregunta viene por lo siguiente: En YR se vive todos los días la eterna discusión entre “ateos” y “creyentes”, en el entendido que los segundos tiene “fe” y los segundos no, pero ?realmente los que se nos decimos “creyentes” tenemos fe?.      Yo pienso que si realmente creyéramos lo que predicamos, con la misma intensidad con la que defendemos nuestros puntos de vista, nuestra vida sería muy diferente... o ?en YR (que realmente no representa un compromiso verdadero) somos prácticamente unos “fanáticos religiosos” y en la vida diaria somos totalmente indiferentes?.      Mi planteamiento es el siguiente:      De cierta manera se podría decir que ni los “creyentes” ni los ateos tiene fe, pero por lo menos los ateos son más honestos con ellos mismos y lo reconocen abiertamente, mientras que la mayoría de los “creyentes”, se declaran así por simple “Apuesta de Pascal”, (más vale ser “creyente”, por si las dudas...).

20070317005625AAvRqdq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	The reason for all the sex scandal in Catholic and Christian church,  read Romans 1:18-27?	For God’s wrath is being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who are suppressing the truth in an unrighteous way, because what may be known about God is manifest among them, for God made it manifest to them.  For his invisible [qualities] are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable;  because, although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God nor did they thank him, but they became empty-headed in their reasonings and their unintelligent heart became darkened.  Although asserting they were wise, they became foolish  and turned the glory of the incorruptible God into something like the image of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed creatures and creeping things. That is why God gave them up to disgraceful sexual appetites, for both their females changed the natural use of themselves into one contrary to nature.

Last year I met this wonderful guy and we get on really well but I dont want to burden him with the worries and upset that I am going through so am leaving him for the time being and doing my best for everyone this is an email I got from a rather irate young lady:      "You want me to rephrase me answer b/c of the statement some random guy ok fine. It should not matter if you have known him your entire life you are still married. My answer remains the same, with only one change a guy you've known for a long time. And, you'r story of mistreatment on your husband's part does not excuse you or make you better it is just your way of putting a band aide on what you are doing. Wrong is wrong, if you want to feel better about yourself then do the the right thing on your part. Again there some underlying reason why you choose to stay in such an abusive marriage. Oh! yeah that's right you are protecting them, you go girl and continue to be protector/hero in your own mind you have all of my respect. Your are very near to being a Saint, someone doing something like protection and there's no pay off for it yeah right!"

20090131110638AA6VxAq	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	It's not you, it's me...is there any truth to that statement?	I've had this "friend" for awhile who likes to kiss me or grab me and tell me I'm sexy (especially when she's drunk) we became "friends," and she would cuddle with me and talk to me and stay the night. She fell for a boy, eventually he did not reciprocate. She's been messing with me for about three months. Last night like many of our weekends we drank and she always gets really affectionate or gropey towards me. Well she was also flirting with another guy, who I was also flirting with. It got down to a bit of a threeway makeout party on the couch. Then she grabbed my hand and took me into the back room...she was like, "You don't want to be in a threeway, do you?" I said, "What you're saying is you want to hook up with this guy without me around." I don't remember what she said back. But I think she confirmed that she didn't want me involved. I said something about being attracted to her but that I also cared for her and that she should go for what she wants instead of messing with my head. She said she cared for me and that's why she can't be with me. She said that she can't have relations with people she loves. I told her it was "bullshit, and that it was an easy let-down." I told her she didn't care for me...she then said it was herself and not me. She was like, "I'm ****** up in the head" She looked like she was going to cry. Even though I knew this would happen, I can't help but feel completely weirded out by the outcome. Why would she mess with me so much? I felt like telling her she wasn't effed in the head she was just an asshole. I feel like I should not associate with at all anymore.

Well my friend is the only black guy in the room and at the begining of the hour I heard the teacher say to my friend that he was going to pick on him so I was like well it must me about that. Well they started doing the skit and the teacher asked who stands out. Everyone was like umm him cause he has funny hair. And then I was like well I think he does because he has a differnent skin color. Serisoly everyone in the class was looking at me and laughing. That was the right answer but I still felt terrible... The skit was about how the secret service was looking at him because he was different instead of looking at the guy with the gun...      PS. I am not racist, and I didn't think before I said that outloud in class and I feel terrible and I was very embaressed.

I want to convert very badly and I want to tell my parents that I no longer believe in this. I said that if God is all loving why is he saying that he will banish his creations to hell.   I am scared, however, of the consequences of converting. After a childhood of hearing this, I don't want to become atheist or agnostic then find out that God really does exsist and then go to hell.   How do I overcome this fear? Should I convert?

20070528121607AAs0CMO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think my path is the work of Satan?	I started practising Wiccan religion. Based on all the information I've recieved regarding it (thank you to all those who helped me on taking a path that works for me), I worship the God, the Goddess and The All (or One)...my intereptation is God is Jesus, the Goddess is Mary, and The All is the Almighty God. So in all actuality, it's more like 3 aspects of God. I'm still learning but I can tell you that since I've taken this path I've been much more at peace with myself. My daily stress seems to disappear easier. I sleep better. It's a feeling I can't explain. Many of you may say that I need to repent, that I'm on a satanic path. That can't be possible since he doesn't exist in my religion. Hell does not either. No sin, just karma. There's good and there's bad. It's all up to you what path you chose. What are you thoughts? This is plainly curiosity. :)

You said that you truely cared,   That falling in love just made you scared,   Was it stupid for me to believe,   That you really did care for me?      But even now as I feel the pain,   Wishing for the numb that's never came,   Only one thing is in my mind,   About how I'd forgive you again this time.

20090131123724AAjDd3E	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	What should I do about my boy troubles?	I just don't get guys. Which really makes me mad because I am one. And you think I would have some insight to what could be going thought their heads.      I need to know a few things:   1) Should I put up with this?   2) What can I do to avoid this again? (because unfortunately this is not the first time I've had this happen)   3) And most important; is it me that is the problem?      Let me start from the beginning. I met this guy; lets call him Bob. Bob and I met online and clicked right away. We chatted non-stop for 2 weeks solid. 1 a.m., in class, and while eating dinner; anywhere and everywhere we would text.      We finally cleared some time so we could meet each other. The days that lead up to the meeting my phone rang of the hook from text messages from Bob. Then we met and it was amazing. It was everything we had hoped for. Then we just stopped talking. It might have had something to do with the fact his best friend showed up and made everyone feel like a third wheel. Lucky as soon as she left we went back to our normal selves. And when it came time for me to head home, he gave me a kiss good-bye and I was off.      Now, it's like pulling teeth to get him to talk to me. It'll be a good week or soon between Bob’s texts. And I've tried to take a pro-active role, texting every now and then, but no change. So I tried giving him space, and still no change.      He does still text me though, and when he does it's like the good old day. But most recently he gave me the line "I don't feel like talking now, I got a 60 page homework project I got to have done for tomorrow."   Which I replied "Okay, fair enough, text me when your done :)."   He replied, "Will do."   And I was and still am okay with that. (I'd rather be told you don't have time to talk to me then have mind mind work against me giving me all these thoughts that he hates me.)      However three days later I still hadn't heard from him so I sent him a "Hey" text just to see what happened. And I got a reply, and we talked like normal. But as soon as I asked what happened and why he didn't text me after his 60-page project it just went dead.      It don't get it. I'd like to believe that the phone company is just loosing my texts, but how many texts need to be lost before I start to believe otherwise. Despite all this I still have feelings for Bob, it's just I'm starting to doubt myself.       My questions are above. Any help or advice you could give would be greatly welcomed.      Thanks :)

I'm thinking of going to live and work there, as I've always been fascinated and enchanted by the country/culture. I was also wanting to learn to speak the language before I go as I believe it is ignorant to go to another country and expect them to speak your language. Although I may not be fluent by the time I arrive I would probably be able to get by with the basics. My only worry is that there might be some resentment towards white English men because of our history with Japan, and our association with America. If you could help answer my question then I'd be very grateful.       Also, I would love to learn more about the Japanese culture and traditions (as I want to try and integrate into Japanese society). So, if you have any tips then feel free to give them.

All thru my life, kids in school used to say, "Why do you sound...white?" At first I paid it no mind. Then after a while (years) it started to get at me. I thought, "What is sounding white?" The way I talk seems normal to me. I mean I dont have the typical Brooklyn Girl accent, but I feel like I fit in. Fine. But, the problem comes in here: Most of the women I date are black and they notice it. One girl asked me out of the blue "Where did you grow up?" I said, "Brooklyn." she says, "Oh, why do you sound so white?" What should I do? I don't necessarily mind my voice, but I can't help the way I talk and it seems to be getting in the way. I guess people have Pre-Conditioned thoughts about what ill sound like when they first see me, and sometimes, it kind of makes me feel low when they say that. How should I handle a situation like that?       Additional: Yes. Im black (caribbean, african american, irish (I did not grow up around the latter part of the family).

Here is my story, my whole life i have been straight [dated guys, sex] until i was 17-18.  I started to become curious and was attracted to girls.  I catch ed myself glancing at girls here and there.  And then when i was 19 i meet this bisexual girl who was my friend at first.  She would constantly want to hang out and one day told me she was into me.  i would tell her that i was straight but then one day when i was with her i could just think of her and her lips. We made out and started dating since then.  We would mess around even oral sex and we dated for 6 months.  I was never public about it, cuz i was scared my parent would find out, because only my sister and my cousin knew.  We broke up after 6 months and i started dating guys again and then i meet this girl and i have been dating her for 7 months since then. We get very sexual and intimate with eachother and i get really turned on by her and i know she does to.   I am 22 with a lesbian girlfriend, but idk if i should continue this relationship.  I catch myself wanting to have a guy at times, but then i love her and i want her to be with me forever, but sometimes i think about having kids and i know she cant give me one.  Am i bisexual, lesbian, what should i do, please help i need advice.  i dont know if i should continue with this relationship

He was like saying loads of **** as he lyed next to me and he was like... really close and ****? Thing is I didn't tell him to go away or nothing. He said 'What would happen if we kissed?'

Our US government set up the welfare system as a financial safety net for those who fall in dire financial circumstances similarly to how the bankruptcy code was set up. I don't respect those people who abuse welfare by getting on it and staying on it as a way of life. Those people are simply low lives that are stupid and lazy. Any answers would be appreciated. Thanks!

20090131130506AAdN7kj	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I'm a straight girl but I like to watch lesbian porn?	I'm 16 and I'm in a long term relationship with my boyfriend of 3 years. When we have sex/engage in sexual activity, I get very turned on by his body, I think he's very sexy, and I always enjoy what we're doing. But when it comes down to porn... I feel awkward looking at other men. They always make the women look better, so why not watch lesbian porn (even if they're fake lesbians)? Is this normal? I know I could never be in a romantic relationship with a girl. There's just something about men that a woman could never possess. I don't know what it is.. anyway, what I'm trying to ask is if it's normal. Again, I could NEVER be with a girl and I know it. It's just sometimes arousing to see two women (not me) do something.      I might also add that to me, it's also arousing to see two men doing something in porn (not if they're ugly though).. what does this all mean? Hormones? I'm so confused. Straight porn can be gross to me because it's so raunchy and unrealistic. Plus they show the whole woman's body and only the penis..

Im applying to a school called college academy, basically it is at broward college and it combines my last two years of high school with my first two years of college. Doing this program allows me to receive my AA degree and high school diploma. I can also transfer to another college of my choice for my junior and senior year of college. Ok now that you have the background. I have to write an essay to get accepted. I have no idea how to start this essay! here is what i have so far:        Robin Cook once said that “education is more than a luxury; it is a responsibility that society owes to itself.” These words mean that we owe it to ourselves to become educated. Being able to attend the college academy will help me continue my education at a higher level. The college academy will allow me to combine the years of my high school and college together to shortening the years I will spend in college, which will allow me to start my career sooner.      do you think that is ok?

The Muslim world is far behind the rest of the world in terms of education, social progress and economic development. One of my hobbies is studying growth in the developing world, and I always feel exasperated reading about the travails of what goes on in the region. And my question; over all other issues facing this region, why do Muslims seemingly place the matter over Israel at the top? Israel does not seemingly directly affect the majority of Muslim countries in any single way, yet the issue is always emphasized even at the expense of other issues? Why?

Recently I've been noticing that I feel attracted for this one girl in my school. But, I read online that bi means you feel attracted as in want to kiss/have sex with her. And I'm sure I do NOT want to ever think about having sex with girls. For boys, it's okay as in it's normal for me to think that. I feel like it's an exception for this one girl. It's like I'm bi for her, but if I ever see prettier girls (which I'm sure there are a lot of girls that are prettier than her), I can only think of them as friends. When I see girls on the street, I never think "Oh she's cute" like how I think that way when I see a hot guy on the street. It's like I'm straight....but for this one girl.....I seem to like her more than just a friend. I love her personality........and I catch myself always staring at her like how I stare at my previous boy crush...      Can someone help? Does bi necessarily mean you want to have sex or kiss a girl? Can it just mean you like her like how you like boys? (Like meaning love)

A debate has sprung out at work, and we are trying to decide out of experience, polls, and others thoughts.    I know everybody is different, but we want a straight answer..   not exactly saying the Best, but more like the most or majority.   We've narrowed down to Latino,Black (not african american, because we are counting all black people in the world),French,Italian and Arab. If you think maybe a different race, let me know too...   Please give me a straight answer, and explanation.    Remember we are not asking for size of penis or stuff like that, that    doesn't exactly mark someone as the best lover. We mean in terms   of love making, passion, sexual moves and all that.   We count all kinds of passionate sex, either rough, slow or paced.   We just want to put one 'race' up there for now, to settle the debate.   We are not offending anyone with this, because every race has there own methods. One may be better at something than the other, while   the other may be better at something else. Get me? Thanks!

I'm slavic and Celtic, and the slavic part comes from being Polish, anyways, this was a old joke told in Poland, while it was a Satellite state..

"Well, in that case your money would be insured by the Bank of Warsaw."       "But, what if the Bank of Warsaw fails?"    "Well, there'd be no problem, because the Bank of Warsaw is insured by the National Bank of Poland."       "And if the National Bank of Poland fails?"    "Then your money would be insured by the Bank of Moscow."       "And what if the Bank of Moscow fails?"    "Then your money would be insured by the Great Bank of the Soviet Union."

20090131132854AAShZaD	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheist: How come SOME of you are so rude to Christians?	I've read that the true Atheist is respectful to everybody no matter what they believe in. I only read this, so i don't know if it's fully true, but it doesn't look so on here.      I don't come to the Religion and Spirituality board much, but when I do, i see more witty questions and rude comments by the Atheist users than by the Christian users.      I know there are other religions, but it seems like Christianity is the most pushed-around one on this board (even though most people in the world are not Christians). I also realize that you've been told perhaps more than once that you're crazy by not believing in God, and I can understand that that would offend you, but I have seen many Christian users asking something serious about their faith and a flock of Atheists come in and tell them how stupid they are for believe in God and then give thumbs down to all who give decent answers.      I'm not trying to point fingers i know plenty of Atheist people who are wonderful folks; I'm just wondering what the deal is. Is it always like this on here? Why?

What the bible really teaches, how do you approach 1 John 5:7,8      I John 5:7-8 contains additional text which was added to the original. "For there are three that bear record {{{in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness in earth}}}  , the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one."      The  {{{ text}}} in the above passage was added to the original manuscripts.

If you are phsycic... read this and read the question at the end... what do you think?         When I was about 7 I went to my HORRIBLE grandma and grandpas house to spend the weekend there while my mom and my dad went to Florida. The first night they were gone, I had a horrible nightmare that my mom and dad got into a car accident. Right when I got up in the morning I called my mom because I got freaked out. When I called she told me she was in a car accident and went to the hospital.      This is a true story. Another one (then Ill ask my question at the bottom)         When I was 4 I wished for a little sister because I got lonley. I kept wishing and wishing. In 2007 my mom had a baby girl and I got to name her. Right know she is 1 years old.      True story... Now I got one last one.      I went to bed one night, and this was the day before my Middle School started. I had a dream that I would be lonley and crying (just alittle bit) because I was alone and didnt know anyone at my new school. Later on in that dream, I made a new friend and he was a boy. he became my best friend.      Afew months later after the dream, everything happened that I pictured or dreamed. I have a best friend and his name is Scottie, and on the first day I was crying because I had no one to confort me.      NOW MY QUESTION IS... do you think I might have a physycic type ablility? If so, do you know what it is called?         Thankyou if you helped me. im just curious if I am or not!(Phsycic)         THANKYOU!!!!      -bella

20090131141354AAA8oWz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did mary and babby jesus flee to egypt or go straight home?	It is impossible to reconcile Luke's account of the family of the newborn Jesus soon returning to Nazareth in Galilee, with Matthew's assertion that the family of Jesus immediately fled to Egypt for several years to escape Herod's wrath (Matt. 2:13-14). Luke has Joseph and Mary present Jesus in the temple in Jerusalem when he was forty days old, and then return straightaway to Nazareth (Luke 2:22,39). Also, Luke records that each year the family went to Jerusalem for the Feast of Passover (Luke 2:41) - this does not tally with Matthew's claim that they were hiding out in Egypt. Matthew, with his predilection that Old Testament prophecies be fulfilled in the life of Jesus, appears to have invented the massacre of the innocents to fulfil a prophecy of Jeremiah (31:15), and the consequential flight to Egypt to fulfil Hosea's prediction that "out of Egypt I have called my son" (Hosea 11:1).       Christians how do you deal with this contradiction, its not a translation error, its not out of context, its not a lie, i've quoted appropriate passages, what are you gonna do?

20090225085932AAp3lQv	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	As LGB are you attracted to gender or biology?  or both?	Is it all about what is between the legs or is there more?      Is it femininity for lesbians as well, masculinity for gays.  How much does the right body chemistry (pheromones) make attraction for a long term relationship better for you.        Not about the sex, about the relationship.      For lesbians, if you met an attractive woman and she told you on a first date that she was pre-op transexxual would you react positive or negative?   What about post-op?      For gays, what about your initial attraction to a transman?      Transsexuals after transition can also be gay or lesbian.  Just wondering what percent of GLB would enter into a relationship with one.

On my mom's side, my grandmother told me about how she grew up in Tennessee always wary of the night riders. Every once in a while,  the family would have to turn off the lights, and crouch down beneath the windows to "hide". Sometimes her father would clutch his gun in his hands, in case they tried to break into their house.   Also, she recalls a very hot day in July when she wanted some icecream. But the vendor turned her down. He said," Goin now, you a little colored girl, you kind isn't allowed here." She was crushed; she told me she couldn't understand what made here different( only 7yrs. old).    The other side of the family comes from Mississsippi and the deep South, apparantly it was so bad, that to this day when I ask my Grandmother to tell me about it, she gets very quiet.

20090225092045AALExtL	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Have you ever seen "Shadow people" and are they really ghosts?	OK when I was a little kid I used to wake up in the middle of the night and see the outline of people walking from my living room to my moms room. Sometimes they would stop in my doorway and appear to be looking at me. I don't remember being afraid as a kid, just curious as to what they were. But somewhere down the line I became afraid of the dark and refuse to be in the dark ANYWHERE. I used to fall asleep with my light on and mom would turn it off after I was asleep. Now I'm 24 and leave my bathroom light on at all times so my room isn't dark at night. I often wonder if my memory of these "people" walking around was my imagination, a dream.. or was it real. There were lots of them, like.. "a line" of them walking into my moms room. My brothers think the house is haunted but I don't think so. The only weird thing that happen to me in that house (other that the shadows) was one day there was poop smeared all over the garage door and on the wall next to it. NO idea how it got there or what kind of poop it was, the cats? human? I dunno, but it was gross. And no one fessed up to it and I can't believe ne one would have done something like that. Anyyywayyyy here is my other question which now that I think about it could these shadow people be linked to my mom? Read other question for more info.  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...

To begin let me insert this; there are no sneaky 'angles' to my questions, nor are they intended to be provocative or try to humiliate. I am intellectually curious. Take me at face value, please.   Now, my question.    1) Islam believes in things being preordained(destiny, fate), that your life and all its events are decided at birth. However it also believes in free will and personal responsibility for what one does. How does Islam reconcile these two seemingly contradictory views? Especially when it comes to crime and punishment and the afterlife ie if someone is sent to Hell for denying Islam was their spiritual sentece set at birth? Or are only some things preordained? And what is the method for determining this, for example, if it was someone's fate to be murdered how is the murderer guilty of anything but fulfilling God's will?

I used to tell racist jokes or make racist remarks a lot when I became friends with a certain person. He made them a lot, and I got 'dragged in'. A lot of the sites I hung out on/games I played were full of people being racist too. I sort of... adopted this.      Like I said, I made them a lot. But, since then, I've realized my wrongs and now I never dare say anything like that. I feel terrible about what I did. I'm a sinner repenting my sins. For those of you wondering: I knew at the time what I was doing was wrong, but I did it anyway. Since then I've realised how bad it was, and, I stopped. I still feel guilty though.      I feel disgusted with myself for what I did. Do you think I'm still a bad person?      For the record, I no longer hang out with the racists...      Thanks.

20090225085903AAmFEhQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Different  level of spirituality than husband. Don't feel comfortable in church, advice please.?	Your Question   Advice please. Don't feel comfortable at Church. Different spiritual level than husband, what to do?   Hello! Any advice would be appreciated, I am feeling very distraught about this. I will give a little background info but try not to make it too long.   Husband and I have been married 5 years & have 3 kids. Over last few years my husband has been very deep into his spirituality and has had a calling to get into ministry work. Recently he was given an opportunity at a local church to become the Youth Director and while doing this he would be able to obtain his credentials to become ordained, this is a dream come true to him.   I feel so very uncomfortable at this church. They scream and shout and jump up and down and fall on the floor when the pastor prays over them and the thing that I have the hardest time dealing with is that they speak in tongues, this is so very foreign to me. I have expressed this concern to my husband and he says he is fine with me not gong to church however I feel that I am not being very supportive of him if I don't go. He is very supportive of me in all that I do. Do I put my "uncomfortableness" aside and go to church? What should i do?   My husband is black and I am white, the congregation is very diverse. I grew up in a small country town and not in the church. Although I have come a long way in my spirituality I don't think I will ever be on the level my husband is. I don't know how to balance this. Any suggestions?   Thanks so much!

I believe it's dangerous ground to tread to say that at 20 weeks it's a baby, but at 18 weeks it's just a fetus.      I question my own motivation for being inclined to disqualify a fetus from being a human. I choose to not trust my own rationalizations and err on the side of caution. What if, for all my confidence in being pro-choice, I'm wrong? I have to be humble to accept that I could be wrong, and if I'm wrong about being pro-choice, I've taken a life, but if I'm wrong about being pro-life, I have not taken a life.

I know being able to have children in any society or culture is good but I dont understand simply so how would u know if the woman could bear children before you marry her?

She doesn't let me hang out with ANY of my friends who are Hispanic/black.

She actually listens to all the stereotypes of certain races doing bad things and being bad people, when it's not true. I have told her what I think about her racism in the most adult way I could.

20090131135347AAi7scz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists converting opinions?	I think perhaps because active atheists tend to have a conscious reason why they reject the notion of God. For them to then turn to religion requires not just some sudden flood of 'belief' but also the need to file away whatever reason they previously had for thinking God illogical or whatever.      I don't wish to suggest for a moment that atheists who turn to religion are stupid/insane/whatever. Atheism comes with a certain mindset about the universe, and for that to change - to switch the whole way you accept and process evidence - is a strange thing.      What I DON'T understand is how somebody who is or has been actively atheist (I say actively atheist, rather than just agnostic, or not having known a religion and so atheist by default) can suddenly turn to religion.       It strikes me as utterly ridiculous.

Okay, I actually feel a little embarrassed posting a question like this on this board, but I was hoping someone might give me a little insight, or simply just to listen.      At college, I feel like I'm living a double-life. I spend my thrusdays and half my friday nights hanging out with a bunch of friends who are very christian in their beliefs. I attend their christian concerts, cermonies and dances and parties that they always have on those nights. Then, I spend the other half of my friday nights and saturday nights drinking at frat house parties and going clubbing.      I have so much fun with both group of friends, but I hear my friends talk, and I know my neither groups of friends wouldn't be caught dead hang out with the others.       Sometimes when my friends ask me what I'm doing on a certain night, I find myself saying simply, "I'm hanging out with some friends I haven't seen in a while. But let's be sure to catch up later!"      I genuinely have so much fun whatever it is I'm doing, but lately I'm feeling torn. I hear how my christian friends say, "oh, people who get drink are trying to fill a hole in themselves when really, they should learn to get closer to God". Then my other friends will say, "oh, people who say that they surrender themselves to God need to have a reality check."      I've accepted it'll always be this way, but I still feel uncomfortable with all the in-between secrets I don't tell people.      I feel lonely sometimes living this way.      What could I do differant, or even if I should?

20090225093124AAojRKW	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Would you say I'm still a bad person for being a racist before?	Hey. I used to say racist things a lot, and I used to make racist comments too. I used to be, all-in-all, a racist. However, this was a while ago. People around me didn't help (one of my closest friends used to make racist jokes 24/7 and I kinda of got drawn in) but it's still my fault.      Since then I've never said anything racist. Period. I hate myself for saying these things. I feel terrible for the things I used to say. I never ACTED on what I said, only words. The worst past IMO is that I didn't actually mean any of it. I just said it because my friends found that sort of stuff funny (as I said, some of them were racists).      I've been feeling horrible about myself for this for a while. Since I started to turn my life around, being a good person, the guilt of how I used to be has caught up with me. Like I said. What I did was horrible and wrong and I wish I could change the past but I can't.      So - would you say I'm still a bad person?    Thanks.

And what about all of the world religions that existed in Japan, China, Egypt, etc?  Did they just make them up to have something to believe in?  I believe that there is some form of superior being that must have a hand in our existence and purpose....but there are so many different beliefs and views, it's hard to unravel them all.  Also, I did go to church when I was younger so please don't try to preach to me.

20090225093837AAIRab2	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Will I be able to pass as a MtF transgender?	I am a MtF transgendered person and I want to start transitioning and taking hormones soon the only problem is that I am very worried on my ability to pass as a female.  There are a lot of MtF's that tell me that your ability to pass should not affect your decision to transition but for me it is the most important decision.  If I am unable to successfully pass then I will never be able to feel as a women because people will either perceive me as a man or a man dressing as a woman.  If people perceive me this way then I will never be able to feel like a real woman.  The problem for me though is that I am 24 now and I'm worried that I may have passed or be passing soon the general age where hormones begin to become less affective.  I also know that a lot of people say YMMV (your millage may vary), but I do know that in general someone may age will not be as affective as someone who transitions when they are like early teens.  So I would very much appreciate it if you can help in any way.  Also here is a link to a picture of me  http://www.guessmyage.net/index.php?us=3...  so you can get a better idea

The following day after I arrived I had to attend a funeral of my daughters principal, I went up to the casket said my prayers and suddenly felt very weak and dizzy and a strong urge to drink coffee.
