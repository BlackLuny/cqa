Best wishes to you!|`|M8Bz0aYuaa	You have to be enrolled in school at least half-time (usually about 6 credit hours) to receive a federal student loan.  The money is usually sent from the bank to your school, and the school applies the funds to your student bill.  If there's any money left over after paying your bill, the school gives the remainder to you, unless you ask them to return it to the bank (which is MUCH better for you in the long run).<br>  <br>  The amount of the loan depends on the cost of the school, other financial aid you've received, and your grade level.|`|f7JIqk5Raa	I guess it depends on who you go through to get the loan but I don't believe your past credits are a factor...at least not the one I went through. Usually they will require you to take a certain amount of credits the semester you have the loan(mine made me take at least 6 hours to maintain the loan), but I don't think your grades will even be looked at. The year you are matters, because the upper classmen like jrs and srs are granted more than freshmen and sophmores. I'm sorry I'm not much help..I'd definately call the bank you'd like to use and ask them about their requirements and if moving states will matter with the loan. Good luck!
UtEp5fJuaa	85.52 so far<br>  <br>  Since you changed it your average went to 86.72 so far|`|AA11735935	Okay, first, if the tests are worth 60% of the final, then each test is worth 20% not thirty.<br>  <br>  Assuming the 85 is one test grade, then you have 31.04 points out of 35 points so far.  You have 65 points left to earn.  You could still get better than a 95% for the class.<br>  <br>  If that 85 is an average of the three tests, then you have earned 65.04 out of 75 so far.  You would only have 25 points left.  The best you could do would be a 90%.|`|Fa2X600iaa	Stop being a show off nerd
4BBjhHAnaa	I think many first time mothers, if not all of them, worry about things like this and their fitness to be a mother.  Get help from and ask questions of the mothers around you.  Also read some parenting books.<br>  <br>  This won't get rid of your sense of worry, but it will help you answer your questions.|`|Fnbz8q9Vaa	hi<br>  it is perfectly normal to worry. You are not being pathetic! You simply need to get two things - first, some information. You can get this from library books, your GP, your family and friends, magazine, the internet - that way you will know the facts of what is going to happen to you, your body, your emotions and the baby.<br>  Second thing you need, is support. You need to find someone/some people who will listen to your fears and hopes and help you work things out for yourself - there is no 'rule' for when to stop breastfeeding for example, some women do it for years, others a few weeks. The NHS recommend 6 months minimum. You can find support from your GP there will be pregnant women's groups I am sure, they can put you in touch with, and website forums, and of course your family and friends.<br>  Don't forget your hormones are all over the place just now so you will feel more... well, emotional, than normal! Stick with it, you are at the beginning of a fabulously exciting journey

I8DXi3B3aa	No, learning disabilities can be acquired from brain injuries, and other trauma.|`|8dbdaa41e161ab849eed90e5dcce161daa	Nope.|`|38852752ccd0ae855afeb5b23f504950aa	No,I wasn't born with a LD.|`|ldElfsOCaa	Other than genetic predispositions such as down syndrome or mental retardation, as well as other factors such as injury, MOST learning disabilities are not disabilities at all. All children are required to reach certain milestones at certain times, and all children are also different in the way they develop. However if one child  appears further behind than other children, it is often considered a learning disability. Often that child does not have a disability, but has other interests that preoccupy him, taking learning in a different direction. These children are often just as smart as any other child, but because they have interests or non-interests in learning or developing within a certain area that is not the norm, they become labeled. And once labeled, people believe they have a disability and simply give up in that area and accept what they have been told. Yet the majority of these people by no means are stupid, but they have a "disability". We are all individuals and while it is true most people have a pattern that coincides with a norm, this is not true of everyone. That does not mean they have a disability. We as people tend to make standards and encourage uniformity, when we should be doing the opposite. It is those who dare to be different, breaking away from the "norm" that make changes within the world, or even their own lives.|`|jgERNzGYaa	i have a learning visual spacial disability.  This is where i have trouble with math and puzzle like problems so i have a fair amount of knowledge on this subject.  i believe that you are born with learning disabilities unless your brain gets damaged with injurys or sickness.  i was a great student up until 6th grade or so until they found my disability.  this is because as i went through school the work began to get harder and it was exposed.  If you or someone you know has a learning disability, it is important to go to a psychologist and get it documented so accommodations can be met.  I have learned to cope with my disability and i am not attending Salisbury University to get my teaching degree and help kids with similar problems.  sorry for the rant but i hope this helps.|`|EomC3vqTaa	Yes.  In order to have a true learning disability (large gap between IQ and the area of concern i.e. IQ=115 and reading comprehension sub. pop. is 85) you must be born with it.  A lot of people confuse learning disabilities with slow learners, or learners who are performing at there ability level.  All that being said, learning disabilities can be overcome.  I have seen many students overcome their disabilities.|`|MB4siWy0aa	No.<br>  <br>  It is possible to be born with learning difficulties through genetic expression, or from brain injury pre birth or during birth.  However, learning difficulties can also develop or be acquired as the child grows.  This can happen through a range of environmental causes.
1kOIXVHoaa	Q. how did you convince your parents to homeschool you?<br>  A. I didn't. On the contrary I'd have to convince them I hadn't lost the plot and gone insane if I was ever to want to go to school.<br>  <br>  Q. do you work at your own pace?<br>  A. Yes<br>  <br>  Q. does your mam correct your work or is it all done by you on computer? <br>  A.No, if any of my work gets 'corrected' it's because I choose to do it myself. The vast majority of my learning is informal and experiential though so does not lend itself to any notions of 'correcting', 'marking' or 'grading'. <br>  <br>  Q. do you get tests?<br>  A. No. In my country, those of us who are home-educated are in part excused but mostly excluded from doing any school tests, exams, certificates or qualifications. The government deems us to be ineligible as we 'exist outside of the school system'.<br>  <br>  Q. how do you find homeschool?<br>  A. It ROX!! It means I get to grow up within my own community and my own culture whilst all the time learning those particular skills, knowledge and abilities that I shall need as an adult. Home-education provides a thorough and extensive "cultural apprenticeship" to draw on in the future. <br>  <br>  Q. can you choose your school hours?<br>  A. Yes, except as a natural learner, I don't have any 'school hours' as such. To my parents all life is learning and all learning is life.<br>  <br>  Q. do you think its better than public school? <br>  A. The closest school is a two-day drive away from where we live so is not available to my family anyway; yep, I do reckon home-ed is better, heaps better. Home-ed is all about my real life, both now and in the future; whereas those friends of mine who do go to school describe it as being no more than an interlude in their lives, something that, to them, is not quite real; and is totally disconnected from any semblance of their proper life up here in the bush.<br>  <br>  ETA: I live in Australia, not Ireland. There used to be a school up here, about four hours away, but it was closed down in the mid-1980s so now it's a straight choice between home education or boarding school. <br>  <br>  (Don't know if I told you this before but my mum's family originally came here from Ireland, from Killarney; that was about 100 years ago though.)|`|dCewrtXaaa	As you can see from the answers given so far, the parents of homeschooled children are not always the most responsible. Spoiled children often beg and cry and get their way because they think it will be easier than school (those tend to be the same ones who wheedle for someone to do their work for them online "pleaseeeee"). If no one supervises them or checks their work or tests them in any way, they are right that it is easier but their education will surely suffer tremendously from staying home, sleeping late, wandering around the house all day in pajamas, and goofing off.<br>  <br>  You may think I am being judgmental or jumping to conclusions, but these commentaries come from the horse's mouth, with the children themselves bragging about their laidback "lifestyle" here on YA while they are supposedly "working at the computer."|`|yJSPecgoaa	As you can see from some of the negative answers here, people who are insecure about, or uncomfortable with, their own schooling  seem to make a b-line for the "Homeschooling" section under Yahoo Answers.  One would think (or at least hope) that they would be secure enough with their OWN schooling that they would not feel the need to come to the Homeschooling section simply to denounce it. (They give themselves away every time and, therefore, their denouncements aren't worth taking seriously.)<br>  <br>  Now, to answer your very good questions.<br>  <br>  The best way to convince your parents to homeschool you (and I am a parent myself) is to focus on how much education MATTERS to you.  Tell them that public school, with all the drama and distractions, is holding you back academically.  Insist upon the academic progress that homeschooling affords you, but which public schooling does not.  Remind them (without whining) that education in our culture is the key to future success.  Tell them that your education (and your future success) matters too much to you to put it in the hands of institutionalized, government-run schooling (which is what public schools surely are), and that you are fully prepared, and very much motivated, to pursue education in such a way that you are assured progress beyond what you possibly could get in the public schools. [See <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?The-Results-of-Home-Schooling-vs-Public-Schools&id=583831" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?The-Results-of...</a> ]<br>  <br>  Yes, you can work at your own pace.  That is one of the great advantages of homeschooling.<br>  <br>  No, your mother does not necessarily have to correct your work.  Many homeschooling programs are self-correcting.<br>  <br>  Depending on your state's requirements, you may be subject to testing.  Then again, you may not.  (To find out your state's requirements, see <a href="http://www.hslda.org/laws/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.hslda.org/laws/default.asp</a> ]<br>  <br>  Yes, you can choose your school hours.  Generally, it takes 3 hours of homeschool study to accomplish what it would take a week to accomplish in a public school.<br>  <br>  It depends on the person, but generally speaking, home school education far surpasses institutionalized schooling (i.e. public schooling). <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|eG7rb1Kbaa	I convinced my parents because public school was so crazy! Yes, you do work at your own pace. The way your work is graded depends whether your curriculum is online, or in textbooks.<br>  <br>  Yes, there are tests in the textbooks, and also final exams at the end of each year. You find home school right at home! Yes, you definitely choose your school hours. Anytime you want, you can start. And you can choose the rate you do work. Such as, you can choose to do a few subjects, then take a break, or go straight on through. Your choice.<br>  <br>  Home school is definitely better than public school.<br>  <br>  With public school, there are shootings, bullies, drugs, sex, alcohol, smoking etc. Basically, anything goes, anytime, anywhere. There are so many distractions in public school, and teachers brainwash kids.<br>  <br>  In home school, you have a safe, relaxed learning environment. You learn at your own pace. You're the school, and have much more freedom.|`|4ceMVocDaa	I told them I didn't like the school or the students that were going to go there...(plus shed a few tears)<br>  Yep i do (can be a bad thing for me anyway)<br>  You can do online homeschooling. I don't know how that works, I found this program that sends you like workbooks and you can check your own answers.<br>  Yes<br>  type in  "homeschooling online" or the other way around, but find out the laws for homeschooling in your state are first, it also depends on what grade you'll be doing. <a href="http://www.hslda.org/laws/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.hslda.org/laws/default.asp</a> (that's a good site for the laws)<br>  Whenever i feel like working i do.

Y1Wr2sG8aa	The positives are the social interaction side, and depending on how old the child is, some basic learning and minor discipline issues, i.e. getting them to sit down and listen, sit quietly, sharing etc. I think that the only negatives are using them as substitute parents, my two went for a couple of mornings a week for two or three hours, but at the end of the day the majority of the childcare was mine. That's a personal thing though, circumstances or finances may not allow.
x5VxxH4taa	A tea party is a great activity; it practices cognitive, social emotional as well as language and at times physical.<br>  For example:<br>  Cognitive: The child is contributing  their understanding of the world through his/her actions.<br>  Social Emotional:  The children usually have a tea party with one another, and therefore they are sharing, and communicating.<br>  Language: The children are communicating, and could even enrich their language skills by naming the different materials and supplies they are using while playing.<br>  Physical:  The children may be practicing their fine motor skills when it comes to cutting pretend food, and pouring the 'tea'.<br>  A tea party is a great opportunity of play for children and educators, as it allows the children to explore and practice their stages of play as well as showing their understanding of the world.<br>  Hope this helps!

pQ3fzgjBaa	1. Of course you can get a C and get into college. I got straight C's and D's and got expelled from public school in my freshman year. Then I went to private school and got all A's, a few B's and one or two C's and now I'm at a top tier university.<br>  <br>  2. You should be considering college, thinking about where you want to go and what you want to do so you'll know whether you can slack off a bit and still get in or if you need to take all AP classes and work super hard.<br>  <br>  3. Well I took a lot of courses in high school, twice the required amount for public schools, but just the right amount for my private school. Colleges will be more impressed if you take the minimum amount of classes and take hard ones like physics, calculus, british literature. If you take a bunch of fluff classes like arts and dramas then they won't be as impressed. Try taking AP classes, if your school doesn't have them do what i did, take college courses. By the time I graduated high school I was considered a full-time college student and had 24 credits. Colleges eat that up because it shows you took advantage of all academic advantages you had, even when not required to do so, and that you can handle college classes.|`|12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	Right now I wouldn't be worried.  If you're not going to Harvard or Yale there's no reason to stress so much.  Keep your grades up and an occasional C is not going to kill your chances.  <br>  <br>  No, taking more classes doesn't mean you have a better chance.  They don't look at how many credits you take.  Colleges want to see good classes.  So, if you take AP classes when you're a junior/senior then that is looked upon really well.  They are also wanting to see at least 2 years of a second language now.  If you really want more direction I'd call your local college (where they offer your degree) and ask them to send you some info on what qualifications you need.<br>  <br>  Maintaining a 3.5 is the best and also getting good SAT/ ACT scores will help gain access.  <br>  <br>  I think being active in the community or school is important as well.  If they see you're active in volunteer work and clubs and doing well and take a few AP classes w/ a high GPA and test scores then you will do fine.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
Nuuk1Nwtaa	You absolutely can't get into MIT on your high school grades. What you should do instead is raise your grades as much as possible before you leave high school, and then go to a community college or state college and get your associate's degree in physics/chemistry. Take honors when you can. Do awesome. Then after two years, apply at MIT as a transfer student. You can try to explain the gap in your high school years during your interview or essay to them, but it had better be a damn good reason, you know?|`|2nANf4kBaa	Wow. There is no way to sugar coat this...<br>  <br>  Hey, try, you might get lucky.
x5VxxH4taa	Imaginative play/ socio dramatic play is one of the best types of play that a child can experience!<br>  Through this play they follow Piaget's theory by contributing to their understanding of the world through their actions, they are able to express themselves however they wish and it is their time to be who they want to be, to try out different roles in society and just to have innocent fun.  Children see everything and they pick lots up, so this play allows them to have an outlet where they can just let out and act out everything that they have seen that has been of interest to them.<br>  Socio Dramatic play is a very important part of a child's development, and usually occurs from ages 2-7 years.  The only disadvantage I can see is that from my experience the children usually stay in the dramatic play area and won't explore and experience any other areas of the room, which are also optimal for development.  In this case teachers could set a timer for about 10-15 minutes in the dramatic play area, and the children could rotate.|`|kqMDzJw0aa	NONE<br>  <br>  but if it seems the child has childhood schizophrenia and cannot come out of her "imaginative world" with ease then you have a problem.|`|QJf2XNaTaa	Not too many... Some children who are bullied, abused, etc. may use this as a subsitute for reality though!|`|Ox2ojFCHaa	Maybe a dependence on what they want the world to be or what to happen vs the real world. That might make the children vulnerable to disappointment and denial.|`|2mTC4wVkaa	There are no disadvantages to imaginative play, but the children that gravitate toward that area tend to like to stay there and not explore the other areas in the classroom.  Imaginative play is wonderful for social, emotional and language development, but other areas of the learning environment are equally important.  If the classroom is set up in learning centers, the children should explore all the areas to have a balanced learning experience.

If you had gotten that on a real IQ test, you wouldn't need to be here asking us about it, since they would have told you what that meant.  So you took an internet IQ test.  Internet IQ tests are just for fun - they are NOT accurate.  You might as well pull a number out of a hat and say that's your IQ.  Internet tests don't agree with the real ones and tend to give out much higher scores.  I've taken most of them for fun, and one of them told me my IQ was 190!  Off by about 70 points, as far as I can tell.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Lol - after reading Serena's list, apparently my IQ should be 141+ plus since I'm getting a PhD in physics.

2D3o9N7Uaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  It took me a long time to understand that getting good grades meant putting time into your work. The difference between an 89 and a 95 is one or two questions. These are the questions you want to get right so putting more time into your work is essential.<br>  <br>  Here are a few tips to help you:<br>  <br>  1) Read the chapters in your books and take notes. This means actually reading before the topics are discussed. Take notes because you will remember more by writing it down as a visual learner. You cannot fall behind in your reading. <br>  <br>  2) Sit in the front of your class. You will be forced to learn more. The teacher will call on you more and you will feel like you have to be prepared to answer his/her questions. You will also not be distracted. <br>  I also believe the teacher will feel like you are trying harder and remember you when grade time comes. This is a very easy way to add points by doing very little.<br>  <br>  3) When studying, read your notes. Also make sure to add to your notes based on what the teacher talks about. Now go through the chapters and focus on what is difficult to remember. If you find sections that are difficult make note cards. Make acronyms to remember things...<br>  <br>  I believe that the bottom line is to read and do your hw. Pay attention and answer questions in class. You will remember more that way. Split up your work so that you read 20 pages a day if you have to read 100 pages a week. If you have to write a 5 page paper in two weeks. Start as soon as you get the assignment. Even if it is writing one paragraph. Always be one step ahead and put the time in and you will<br>  do well. I promise.<br>  <br>  ** I also forgot to mention one of the most important things. Always ask your teacher questions after class. They will love that and often give you hints about what might be on a test. Or have them review your essays. ** This is huge!<br>  <br>  Good luck and stay focused. Tell people your goals. Tell your parents about your goals to get A's. They will reinforce you and then you will not want to disappoint.|`|eCaLnoSiaa	wow what an awful school. Try making diagrams of everything you learn. Or read something, and then try to explain it to someone else. If the two don't mix, you have to go back and get it right. <br>  <br>  Also try connect it to real life. People tend to retain information if they are genuinely interested in it and it relates to them|`|4mb5gr1Daa	go over everything you have learned for that subject and make up little tests for yourself. take a multiple intelligence test. they tell you how you learn better practice that subject using your kind of intelligence

They do like that you were in AP classes and they don't consider your weighted GPA because every school district does those differently.  Plus, if you're officially using a 6.0 scale, you can never have an actual 6.0 GPA because you will never end up with an AP physical education or speech class.<br>  <br>  You're a junior so you have time to get the things that matter up--GPA and test scores, so work on those.  Good luck!|`|FfLzMcexaa	Good GPA and ExCurrics, but get your ACT up.
cilYUWgtaa	The difference depends on the facility, state, etc. Typically a CNA 1 would give standard CNA care while a CNA 2 would do the same, but be a mentor to newbies, and maybe have more responsibilities in the facility. I've never worked where there were CNA 1's and 2's. Read Oregon's take on CNA 2 responsibilities, it depends where you are as to what CNA1 and CNA2 levels mean.
35GfsJ3Paa	A clarinet is a woodwind instrument pitched in B flat. It has a range of about three and a half octaves. It plays band, orchestra, solo, chamber, jazz, Klezmer, and pop music.<br>  <br>  A clarinet is made up of a bell, lower joint, upper joint, barrel, and mouthpiece. The mouthpiece has a reed and a ligature, which holds the reed to the mouthpiece. The clarinet is made of African blackwood, called Grenadilla. The keys are metal and made of nickel. Sometimes they are coated in silver.<br>  <br>  Sound is produced one a clarinet by the player blowing air into the clarinet through the mouthpiece. The player causes the reed to vibrate, which in turn vibrates the column of air inside the clarinet's body, which produces the sound.
3a38kxkhaa	radioactive isotope or radioisotope, natural or artificially created isotope of a chemical element having an unstable nucleus that decays, emitting alpha, beta, or gamma rays until stability is reached. The stable end product is a nonradioactive isotope of another element, i.e., radium-226 decays finally to lead-206. Very careful measurements show that many materials contain traces of radioactive isotopes. For a time it was thought that these materials were all members of the actinide series ; however, exacting radiochemical research has demonstrated that certain of the light elements also have naturally occurring isotopes that are radioactive. Since minute traces of radioactive isotopes can be sensitively detected by means of the Geiger counter and other methods, they have various uses in medical therapy, diagnosis, and research. In therapy, they are used to kill or inhibit specific malfunctioning cells. Radioactive phosphorus is used to treat abnormal cell proliferation, e.g., polycythemia (increase in red cells) and leukemia (increase in white cells). Radioactive iodine can be used in the diagnosis of thyroid function and in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Since the iodine taken into the body concentrates in the thyroid gland, the radioaction can be confined to that organ. In research, radioactive isotopes as tracer agents make it possible to follow the action and reaction of organic and inorganic substances within the body, many of which could not be studied by any other means. They also help to ascertain the effects of radiation on the human organism (see radiation sickness ). In industry, radioactive isotopes are used for a number of purposes, including measuring the thickness of metal or plastic sheets by the amount of radiation they can stop, testing for corrosion or wear, and monitoring various processes.

1uRWWQ6Yaa	Been there, done that. Not bullied anymore. I can handle bullies now, but since I'm a black belt, they don't bother me anymore.<br>  <br>  Here's what you oughta do.<br>  1. Cover yourself legally. You have to tell once a year. Instead of being a tattletale, you should say something like, "I'm not afraid to fight this guy, but I'm only coming to the office because that's the rules. Next time he, or anyone else in the school assaults me, I'm going to beat them because you have failed me. If they're too big, I'm calling the cops directly and let you, Mr.Principal, explain to the Superindendent why there are police on campus.<br>  2. If Bully even says one word to you that has nothing to do with school work after the office has spoken with him, hit him where it hurts, 20 times. Don't stop until you know for sure he is not getting up. Always go to the office, even if you win the fight. You are covered. Call the cops and get bully arrested for Assault. <br>  3. Sue the school and get the Principal fired if you are threatened with suspension for simple self defense.<br>  4. If the bully is waay to big, you might have to stab him with your pencil in the neck, and immediately run to the office. Always report. Let Bully explain why he went out of his way to bother you.<br>  5. Don't worry about Bully's friends. Take down the leader, and the rest will crumble. <br>  6. There's an old saying, "If you want peace, be prepared for war." You may have to fight everyday for the rest of your life. Join the club. Bullies don't fight people who don't let them get away with it. When Bully realizes that it's not cute to bother you anymore, he'll move to a different wimp.<br>  7. The worse thing you can ever do is nothing. If I were in school again, I will take a month's worth of suspension and detention before I will let a bully bother me for 1 minute. <br>  <br>  I went to my 20 year reunion. Not one bully in the whole school showed up, but every guy who was picked on was there. I went looking for payback, but they weren't man enough to come when it was their turn.<br>  <br>  The guy who said the street fighter always wins seems to not grasp the fact that a lot of us black belts have also been in no rules street fights. I'm much more nastier with my cheap shots than he can ever hope to be. <br>  <br>  If you don't take down that bully, you'll become me in a few years. I'm the guy who can't take a joke. I'm the guy who is ready to rip out some guy's throat over the slightest insult. I've wasted the past 2 decades waiting for a bully that I now know will never come. A few thought about it over the years, but they all caved as soon as I took one step toward them. I now know they ALL leave you alone once you take down that first bully.<br>  The hardest bully I have ever fought was the first time that voice in my head told me, "NO! Not this time! I would rather die than let another guy bully me! He's going to have to prove he can beat me!"<br>  Guess what? He couldn't beat me! He never bothered me again!|`|n8UBfhgpaa	revenge is sweet. you need to catch him offguard. i wasnt even close to tough untill 17 years old. it took me a while to realize that a punch doesnt hurt that bad. Let everyone know u r going to punch him out after school and then do it. Even if you lose make sure you put up a good fight, then nobody will mess with you because they know you are not scared. A class bully needs to be knocked out and put in his place, take care of it now before it gets worse. Remember if he hits you, just keep hitting back, it doesnt hurt until its over and even then, a black eye is gone in a week anyway. <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT- I had to laugh when I read the 4th guys answer. Although he is somewhat right, dont say anything to the teachers ever. You want to be a rat then be one, but facts are the only way to handle it is by yourself. And tae kwan doe and karate isnt going to help you. Ive punched out many a black belt, the good street fighter always wins. Those guys arent prepared to be taken to the ground with numerous headbutts and eye gouges. When I was 19 I was at a bar in Ontario where some suposed "golden gloves boxer" tried to bet me 100 bucks he would knock me out. He should have put his money where his teeth ended up so I could retrieve it.

TQ4PZgDPaa	You don't say whether you've yet written anything on the topic or not.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the beginning is the hardest place to begin.  Try starting in the middle.  Begin writing down whatever you know about the case and the opinions surrounding it, as well as the case's conclusion and its consequences.  This will help you organize your thoughts and decide what's important. It's very likely a thesis statement will become clear, in light of what you've written.<br>  <br>  Think of writing not as a means to produce an end product, but as a way to think and reason "outside your head."

8lboONb2aa	GPA and ACT scores required for a particular school usually depend not only on what school you are applying to but also what department like engineering or biology... I's say a 20-24 on the ACT would be a good range score on the ACT to get into most places. However, the better you do the easier it will be to get scholarships and other opportunities so study up on it and don't worry too much if you do not so well the first time. You can always retake it.|`|DdjoMZ3Jaa	Colleges consider a variety of factors.   They look at GPA, SAT scores, your personal essay, and your outside activities.   Your ethnicity is often a factor as well.<br>  <br>  It's difficult to give a precise answer because all of these factors are used together at the undergraduate level.   Call the admissions office at University of Louisville and ask a real person to answer.   If you're shy, you can email their admissions coordinator.   All you really need to do is go the website for the contacts.   Good luck!
2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	Since Duke is generally considered to be a much better school than Auburn, it is pretty unlikely that they would take transfers.

Just keep your grades up and you have a slim chance of getting in.
AA10297143	I suppose it would depend on what type of class it is and what is expected from all the other students.  Making this film implies that you have computer skills, mixing skills, and that you are equipped with these items to create such a film.  In today's computer literate world, students much younger than 14 can understand concepts of computers and do things that boggle the mind, but if you don't possess those skills, then it can be a scary undertaking to try to do this project.

This Kb is small enough to use the approximation<br>  [OH-] ≈ √[Kb*c].<br>  Since we want pH = 10, then pOH = 4, which is equivalent to [OH-] = 0.0001 M. Substituting,<br>  0.0001 M = √[2.51x10^-5 * c];<br>  Solving, c = 0.0004 M.<br>  The molecular weight of NaCN is 36 g/mole, so:<br>  (0.0004 mole/L) (0.425 L) (36 g/mole) = 0.0061 g, or 6.1 mg, of NaCN.
JoyIIiZ6aa	Lady Macduff and her son are murdered in Scene 2.  The theme is that of what is treachery, whether there are more traitors than honest men.  The imagery is that of a family in distress, of a mother who has to break the news of her husband's death to her young son.  She must overcome her own fear and denial, and steel herself for explaining why her husband had died, yet in the end really has no chance to complete her task, because her son is in denial too.  Since he is a child he clings to the idea that his father is still alive more desperately, and in the end Lady Macduff wastes precious time which could have been used to escape.  The murderers stab the boy first, and then follow her as she tries to flee.|`|uSW53DKAaa	What's going on in the scene?

Any time, its better to follow your own path, than be an average student in a popular course, as there is always demand for talent, and none for an average joe.<br>  <br>  successful people are spread in all fields, and they are successful because they chose a path that they were interested and had a liking for.<br>  <br>  so take your call.<br>  <br>  all the best !!!!|`|FT3XmT2xaa	go for your passion if u think u can make it big.

I mean seriously can you imagine what it'd be like to be a couch potato every day until you're 16 and can get a job? By then your life would be ruined because all you know is how to be fat. <br>  <br>  Personally, like I said before, I love school, the challenge, meeting new people, and understanding more about the world.

R5UIMBvcaa	Act sleepy and drunk, since that's the way the Lotus Eaters were.  Then as the lotus wears off, you can start carrying on with withdrawal symptoms.  Have someone in the cast be your lawyer and someone else be a social worker.  Nausicaa might be the social worker, and Circe could be a substance abuse counselor, pointing out how drugs can make men into beasts against their wills.  She could urge Odysseus to put you into rehab, with Eumaeus, who understands pigs, as your peer-mentor.  At that point, Odysseus can say in a puzzled tone, "Mentor?"  The only person I can think of to be your lawyer is that smooth-talking suitor Eurymachus.  In any case, he and the substance abuse counselor could work out a plea bargain in which you get sent to live the rest of your life on Ogygia with Calypso, who's rather spacy herself.|`|deuzhVU8aa	1st be urself, act funny make a joke out of it. i loved drama class. but act like ya'll are playing around in the cell (yall 2 cops) and act like ur not paying any attention to the cellmates and they're like hey c'mon man we tryna get out! and everything gets quiet. u know somethiun like that and go from there.

WbzdAJgdaa	Male<br>  <br>  Answer what?  I would never turn to cosmetic surgery|`|1ZuF9FdSaa	umm...my opinion on what?  Men turning to cosmetic surgery?  The "image of perfection"?  Men's self esteem today?<br>  Is this culture/region specific?<br>  I am an American, male. <br>   I had no idea more men were getting CS.  It seems odd to me because I don't think women care that much about a man's looks as she does about other things.  I believe that advertising uses tactics to make people feel insecure so that they will feel the need to consume products and services.  I believe Americans on a whole are less disciplined, causing them to be more depressed, insecure, lazy and dependent on external sources for happiness.  This includes drugs, CS, TV and consuming/shopping.<br>   I personally feel extremely confident in my looks and would not get CS unless something pretty drastic happened like my face was burned w/ acid.  Even then, I might not; chicks dig scars.<br>  <br>  "Perfection" is subjective to me.  I have my own goals and while other's might share some of them, I have a different idea of "perfect" than most people.  Physical appearance is of fairly low importance.

AA10297143	You have issues with Kindergarten bullying, that is a shame.  This is upsetting because parents aren't doing their jobs as parents.  The bullies need to be set aside and disciplined, but that can be hard, even if they listen to you.

The only way to prevent bullying is to have close supervision of the children and then speak with the bullies directly.<br>  <br>  There is a 'duty of care' to children in schools or kindergarten and both agencies can be held accountable for any injury caused.<br>  <br>  There are many videos on the subject of bullying and it might be useful to do some research on the internet or visit with your local librarian.<br>  <br>  Talking with children at their level of understanding might also help eliminate the practice of bullying.<br>  <br>  It is a serious problem at all levels of society.|`|dMS6uaxbaa	Forget about it, it's not your job to go out of your way and work extra recess shifts for them.

For instance you could have two jars of pennies, two jars of macaroni, two jars of marbles and two jars of popped popcorn.<br>  <br>  Each team is given two sets of jars. The teams look at the jars to try and figure out which has more and which has less than that. When they decide, they put greater than and less than signs made of pipe cleaners between the two sets of jars. When both teams have made their choices, then have them count the items. The team that has the most correct, wins.

This being so, your birthday officially begins at midnight of the day on which you were born. <br>  <br>  But technically, your actual birth was the time of your birth.

For example, at my school there was a club that was responsible for planning all of the homecoming events.  Join something like that to get the experience.  If you get your name out there, you can probably graduate to leading the club and coordinating larger events.<br>  <br>  Believe me, when people are looking to pay someone to plan their wedding, party, or training course, they want someone with EXPERIENCE.  You go and tell someone that you have a degree in event planning and they will likely laugh in your face.

Nuuk1Nwtaa	Check the smaller schools for the percentage of matriculated people there who go on to graduate school. Choose the one which has the higher percentage--you'll be more likely to secure a spot in grad school.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about the size of the school. You can get a good education wherever you go, seriously. People don't realize it mostly depends on your willingness to pay attention, do the work, seek out knowledge on your own, and apply to every day. That is the key, and if you know that you can educate yourself at a public library, a community college, a state university, anywhere.|`|wHgBnMipaa	I am in the same predicament.  Universities really value diversity when they are looking at graduate students, but they also look at how rigorous your courseload has been and the school that you went to for your undergraduate degree.  However, if you can't afford it, go to the college you can afford and rock out.  Do great on your GRE and keep a stellar GPA up.  These things are looked at just as much as where you went to get your undergraduate degree.

yGOmMQP7aa	Why exactly do you think you need to consolidate?  it isn't going to get you a better deal.  Consolidation has been drilled into grads and it really offers no benefits.  The federal loans you have are on a 10 year payment plan.  If you try to consolidate them you might (and I stress might) end up with a slightly lower interest rate, but it may not be a fixed rate like the one you have.  And it will lengthen the time you pay on them.  You'll go from 10 years to repay to 30.  Meaning you'll be paying on them until roughly you retire.  You end up paying more money in interest over the life of the loan.  And if you have federal and private loans, you can't consolidate them together.  <br>  <br>  Some folks go on and on about only having one payment.  But with auto bill pay, who cares?  Honestly.  It doesn't take more time, besides, your loans will likely end up being sold to the same place when you graduate.  (Sallie Mae) and you will only have to make one payment to them.  <br>  <br>  When I graduated with my Master's degree, I owed 22K.  Sallie Mae bought all my undergrad and grad loans and I only made one payment for 10 years to pay it off.  <br>  <br>  THEY split my payment up to get the correct amount to the correct loan.  Simple and easy.  If I'd consolidated, I'd still be paying on them.|`|cO8b7Pniaa	you can consolidate now and the best way to go with the low interest rates would be direct loans.

You will be very embarrassed!|`|b6af7ede8594d3d67b95189dc22ea850aa	You didn't say how old you are or how old he is, but I would suggest that you shouldn't go there.  If you respect this teacher then you wouldn't want to get him into BIG trouble, would you?<br>  My personal opinion is to find someone your age that has some of the characteristics that you admire in this teacher and forget any romantic ideas about the teacher.

dYy1b6j6aa	As a North Carolinian, I can tell you that it is almost essential to be an in-state candidate. The residency admissions requirement is 85%, meaning 85% of admittants must be state residents. I personally did not go to UNC for undergrad, but I will be attending UNC for graduate school this year. Carolina is one of the top public universities in the nation and you must be in the top 10% of your class at the very least. Score well on the SAT and have many extracurriculars!
dYy1b6j6aa	As a North Carolinian, you better get this right. You cannot not like both Duke and UNC. It is not possible. You are bound to be lynched if you wear UNC's colors at Duke and Duke's colors at UNC. I am a Carolina fan and I was mocked several times at Duke. Too bad we beat them twice this year and are going to be a #1 seed. Both are very traditioned programs though...UNC is just MORE traditioned ;). Ian is not correct about business. Duke's Fuqua school of business is overall slightly better by a few spots, but UNC has individual programs that are better. UNC's Accounting, Journalism, and specialized MBA programs are more highly ranked. If I were going to do medicine or law, then I would choose Duke. I would also say that Duke's campus is prettier by far.|`|MTjfiF1gaa	If you can get into Duke - Don't pass it up for UNC. Duke looks really good when applying for a job because its really that good. Don't get me wrong - Academically, UNC is good too. But Duke is on another level for academics. My advice- don't pass up Duke if you get in.|`|FfLzMcexaa	It depends on what you're interested in. Overall, Duke is a finer school, but if you're going into English or Creative Writing, it's Chapel Hill by far. Med or Business, it's Duke by a mile. Both of them are great schools, though.

nmLt7jR4aa	The short answer: No; a plea for kindness is unwanted in such a situation.<br>  <br>  The long answer: A school shooting is a way to release anger out on someone or something (in this case, the school represented as society). When the individual doesn't feel a desire to express any healthy communication with an external source, the 'outside' becomes a target of hate.  One reason why people isolate themselves is because they feel unwanted.  Eventually, the victim feels separate from society so society becomes the general resentment in feeling.  As more isolation occurs, more and more hate for the general populous also happens.  Eventually, there seems to be a 'war' or a 'battle' that must be fought against this 'enemy'.  So, the individual feels that the only communication (and note: there is always a need in communication, no matter what way it is thought to occur- physically, silently, or verbally) is to physically harm them.  Partly also feeling rejected from society, the individual also feels their life is pointless and with no meaning or substance (mostly due to the lack of human interaction).  That adds to feelings of suicide and violence.  The social contract seems non-existent, and will eventually become broken.<br>  <br>  The person involved in the school shooting, in the end, feels that they were never part of society to begin with.  They eventually feel that they don't want to be a part of it, so they decide to make people suffer because of it.  It isn't a plea for kindness; the chance of that was far behind them.<br>  <br>  As a last note, the shooter was never forced into anything.  The individual usually doesn't feel they were forced into anything if that individual takes a large step as killing someone or a group.  That sort of blame doesn't occur in such a serious situation, even if the individual is an age below eighteen.  Of course, rare instances do occur where the shooter blames it on society if they don't commit suicide.  That is mostly due to the 'battle' they were fighting against society, or even more rare, a place to direct the blame elsewhere.|`|9c087cb92c2b43d04d7ba092812e9d32aa	I can definitely see where your coming from, and in a way i think they are just pushed and pushed until they can't take it anymore.  Everyone has a breaking point, and when some people are pushed too far, they do radical things for retribution and take their anger out on people who don't deserve it.<br>  <br>  The scary thing is I know people who get picked on way too much and I can see them bringing a gun to school and shooting all the people who were mean to them.  Not being accepted and having to go through public humiliation makes people do crazy things.|`|TvomFnHmaa	ha yeah right
46y9Zkzraa	Absolutely talk to your course leader. The difference between what you usually earn and the mark on this essay are too large to ignore!

Talk your tutor and s/he should be happy to help.  <br>  <br>  Try not to be too despondent about your mark.

TfL5pFBOaa	Make good first impressions, especially on teachers. The impressions you make during the first week of school affect the entire school year...with most teachers, if they get it in their heads that you're a good student early you won half the battle. Be sure to be on time for every class during this short period of judgment. When all of your teachers hand you those syllabus papers to get signed, carefully present it to your teacher the very next day. (Even though it is easy to forget, TRY.) In regards to your fellow classmates; be yourself. It is important to earn the respect and companionship of your peers early on in the school year. <br>  <br>  Do not procrastinate. The sooner you get things done, the more time you will have to do the things you like to do. No matter how much you would love to plop down in front of the T.V. after a hard day, try to get to work as soon as possible. <br>  <br>  <br>  Find a group of people to sit with at lunch – as soon as possible. The lunch “break” that high-schoolers are allowed is, at first, one of the most stressful experiences of the beginning of the year. If you spot some of your middle school friends gathering together at a table, join in. Be aware, though, that these seating arrangements are often permanent. Also, make sure you do not sit at a table with kids that on first sight you know will be trouble. Pick your table wisely. <br>  <br>  You need your friends for survival. Do not let go. Friends are your lifejackets in the shipwreck of high school -- without them, you could sink. Everyone needs someone to lean on and someone who cares. Stick with those who know you best and like you for who you are.|`|QdQcAHqaaa	Don't take it too seriously.

In high school you get to meet people from all different grades and they aren't mean like they say in movies.  <br>  -You can get by with out a study hall<br>  -A foreign language is not as hard(I suggest Latin it will really help in other   languages and in life)<br>  -Just find friends in each class and the day goes by super quickly|`|yhQXJ8rbaa	i'm going through my freshmen year now. i'm loving it so much more than 8th grade. its a lot of fun, but not really easier than middle school. every year school gets more challenging, but its not like this huge jump in homework or level of the classes. my main advice is not to go into high school with a lot of high expectations. a lot of girls think they'll find the perfect guy or their bestest best friend within the first couple months of being there, which is really untrue. don't be worried about the upperclassmen, they really could care less about freshmen. girls will be catty, and you can never be too sure about who to trust. just relax, and you'll be ok.|`|mt2FbsK6aa	dont be someone your not, and let the stupid **** slide, its not worth getting all worked up over, in the end, things tend to play out the way they should|`|2mfgRI9Haa	Depends on if you're in honors classes...my personal opinion is that freshman year is easy even in honors and sophomore year is way harder.

Adding activities now - will be obvious not a passion but something that you are doing to try to get in.  Will they buy it.  Probably not.|`|nFeGqbOsaa	Okay, UMASS Amherst is sooo easy to get into.<br>  <br>  Join some extracurriculars, though. Maybe school newspaper? Volunteer at a Youth Group or Soup Kitchen? Go to church? Do something!!<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter if you apply for Financial Aid- they encourage that!<br>  <br>  Also, if you start extracurriculars now, it's okay! It shows you're working hard and doing something with your life- no matter if it's a little late.<br>  <br>  What'd you get on SATs? 1500 is above average, actually, just FYI. If you do bad on test-taking,  maybe write a letter to them explaining it? <br>  <br>  What do you want to major in? It helps if you at least have an idea of interests.<br>  <br>  There is tons to do in MA- feel free to ask me more (rekrabread@yahoo.com is my email; i live on the borer of MA and work there and am gonna move back there [i lived there for 13 years, then NH on the border of MA/VT for 5 years] and I applied to UMASS Amherst for this fall but won't hear back 'til April. I was accepted last year, but i didn't go. now i'm re-applying as a transfer student).<br>  <br>  Talk to your teachers and guidance counselors about boosting your GPA and why it's so low- see if there's any extra credit work you can do to raise it! Explain your want to further your education and that extra credit work'll help you get better acceptance rate! <br>  <br>  Do you know your teachers, guidance counselors, or any respected (not relatives) adults that could write you fantastic letters of recommendation?<br>  <br>  Also, when you submit your application, have an english teacher look over your essay.<br>  <br>  Really, just be honest and show your passion for the school. Go to campus tours, do an interview,. Keep everything in order- show that you are in charge of your life and your education.<br>  <br>  Oh- and don't fret. They accept MA residents over out-of-state residents. Besides, they have over 20k students there! You're bound to have a slot! :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|Y5LDQsiYaa	No sorry. My best friend works at the Umass Amherst admissions department. He said that the cutoff is a 3.2 GPA avg, and they are pretty strict about that. They have been changing their policies since last year, making it harder to get into and having a higher standard. So no..im sorry a 3.0 won't get it done. Get it up to a 3.2 and your in.

TfL5pFBOaa	Show up on time. Get the test off to the best possible start by getting there on time. Arriving late might make you feel rushed and nervous, and arriving too early could give you time to sit there and worry about things.<br>  Stay focused and relaxed. Focused AND relaxed? Doesn’t that sound impossible? Well, what we mean is this: keep your mind on the test, but don’t tighten up. Try to stay loose and cool so you can move through the questions one by one. If you feel yourself clenching, or you feel so amped-up that you’re afraid you might actually snap your pencil in your hand, try that deep-breathing thing for a moment. Then get right back to the test questions. <br>  Use all your time. If you happen to finish the test before time is up, don’t sit there staring into space. Go back over the questions, especially the ones that seemed hard, and check your work. Fixing obvious mistakes can help boost your grade, and is way better than just waiting for the clock to run out. <br>  Don’t rush. Try to keep a good pace…but never rush through a question. Make sure you understand what is being asked, then make sure you think clearly about your answer. If the question is multiple-choice, read every single possible answer before you decide which one is the best. Choice A might seem good at first glance, but sometimes the best answer is another one. You can only know which choice is best if you read them all before you answer. <br>  And finally…one more important thing. Once the test is over, try not to think about it for a while. Instead of worrying and fretting about what grade you might get, reward yourself for making it through the test. Go hang with your friends, or spend an afternoon doing something that makes you happy. You can’t do anything to change your grade now, and more tests will come along soon…so just enjoy the fact that you’re finished with one! <br>  <br>  sorry i wrote a book (:

I would prefer buying or at least looking at more than just one SAT book though, because they all contain different variations for certain things. <br>  <br>  Like for Baron's, I heard that they have the most challenging problems and words.

ejodXS5naa	Writing is only impressive if it is published.<br>  <br>  Here are a couple of ideas that will impress people at Caltech:<br>  <br>  1. Take college classes.  Finish what math classes your high school offers and then take Multivariable Calculus (yes, that is beyond AP Calc) and maybe even Differential Equations or Linear Algebra.  Or perhaps physics.  And the better the college you take the classes at, the more impressive it will be.<br>  <br>  2. Win (or do very well at) a national science competition.  You heard of the AIME math test?  Take it and rock it.  Chemistry Olympiad?  Win it.<br>  <br>  3. I will save the best for last: do research.  I don't mean go to your library and do that type of research.  I mean real scientific research.  Find a professor at a local university that will be willing to work with a high school student and join his/her lab.  Do some real experiments or help them with a publication.  That is impressive.<br>  <br>  If these things sound difficult or far fetched, then I don't think you understand what it takes to stand out at a school like Caltech.  Because this is exactly the type of stuff that stands out and there will be plenty of applicants who do this type of stuff.  Simply being first in your class and getting a perfect SAT score is not that impressive to the top schools.  They top schools are looking for someone who really has passion for what they do.  And Caltech is looking for someone with a passion for science.  Someone who will go the extra mile because they love what they do.<br>  <br>  Oh, and of course, you need great grades, excellent test scores, great extracurriculars, exceptional recs, and outstanding essays.

9Qf4khqLaa	EFC is the expected family contribution, meaning that from all the information you entered on your fafsa form, your family is expected to pay 12,600 of your tuition fees and everything. I think that you exceed the limit for a pell grant, so i would look into get a stafford loan. <br>  <br>  But yes, you'll have to pay 38,500 of your schooling costs.|`|yGOmMQP7aa	This is how  you determine what you will have to pay for your school based on your high EFC.  This is an example of how your aid package will look.<br>  <br>  Total Cost of Mills is<br>  51,000 year<br>  -12,500 scholarship<br>  __________<br>  38,500 total cost to you<br>  <br>  You will be offered a federal Stafford loan in the amount of $5,500 (this is the max any freshman can take out) and your parents will be offered a parent PLUS loan for the difference minus your EFC.<br>  <br>  So...<br>  38,500 remaining<br>  -5,500 Student loan you repay<br>  _______<br>  33,000 total cost<br>  - 12,600 EFC (this is NOT what you will have to pay the school)<br>  ___________<br>  20,400 Parent PLUS loan offered your parents repay<br>  <br>  Be sure you realize this is PER YEAR.  So your parents would have to be willing to borrow this much per year for FOUR years, plus possibly come up with extra cash for incidentals for you if you do not have a job and can't buy your gas, books, insurance, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, do NOT judge a school by how big the scholarship is they give you, but by how much money you and the folks have to borrow for you to attend.  on paper a 4,000 scholarship may not look like much next to your 12,500 one. But if it is from a school costing only $4,000 a year, that is 100% paid for!!!  What a deal.  Esp compared to a school you have to borrow 38K to attend.  Maybe that's why it's got the reputation of being selective.  Very few people "select" it when the see the bill.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|SIhxrxD3aa	It doesn't quite work that way.<br>  <br>  Your EFC is only a code used to determine your eligibility for certain types of aid.  It is not the actual amount you'll have to pay.  If that were the case, then students attending cheaper schools would be paying the same as those attending more expensive schools.  <br>  <br>  Your EFC is too high to qualify you for any need-based grants like the Pell Grant.  If it costs you more than 12,500/year to go to this school, then that money will have to come out of pocket or from student loans.<br>  <br>  Yes.  If your school costs 51,000 to attend then you will need to come up with another 38,000. You will be offered 5500 in stafford loans for the year, but that still leaves you with a lot you'll need to pay.

AOr92DhTaa	You don't need to decide right away.  Treat high school as though you are pursuing medical school.  You will need to take the more difficult coursework, get good grades, get involved in activities, etc.  If you decide to go with design after high school, you can still do that.  Design schools won't turn you down because you've taken Physics and Calculus.  You either have a knack for design, or you don't.  There's nothing that they are going to teach you in high school about design that you can't learn on your own. <br>  <br>  If you still haven't decided as graduation comes closer, I would go with medical school.  If at any point you decide you really want to pursue design, it will be easier to switch to design.  If you start with the design path, it will be very difficult to switch to medicine if you change your mind later.|`|2f3b6c50f4f74ae70e87a72675740db1aa	Its funny I can relate to you SOOO MUCH, most of my family is in the medical field too and I too am torn between the creative field or the medical.<br>  <br>  Heres something to think about, although money would be no problem if you were to persue the medical field, does the idea of doing something that your not exactly passionate in seem one that you can tolerate?

4ooXYuYFaa	You are smart to think about this...A couple things to mention..I am married, attending grad school and our household income last year was over $300,000. I just quit my job in January and wasn't sure how I was going to cover the reminder of my tuition (now that I'm not working).  I went ahead and applied for a loan thinking there was no way we would qualify - but they gave me every penny I asked for and then some.<br>  <br>  The major difference is that I did not qualify for the subsidized loan (where the gov't pays the interest while you are in school). I only qualified for unsubsidized...fine by me! <br>  <br>  So, that's the long story. It will help that your girlfriend is in school because your family contribution will be less since you're paying for her school as well.  You may not qualify for any need based aid, but you will probably get all the loans you want.  Bottom line is, you should be totally fine as far as loans go. They will probably like the fact that you have two incomes to help repay!

gbCB0ohJaa	Have you prepared a portfolio of creative work?  They will ask about your portfolio: how you got the ideas, why they interested you, what other kinds of creative work you enjoy.   The information sheet says that they will also ask you to write an essay and draw a sketch while you are there, using tools they would provide.  (But I would probably bring my own pencils, anyway.)  <br>  <br>  There probably isn't much time for them to quiz you on what you already know about the history of architecture.  They will want to see that you know what architecture is.   And if you have some stories to tell about why the field interests you and what related passions you have in your life (photography?  helping your parents renovate an old house?  campaigning for disabled access at your high school?  LEGO and other three-dimensional sculpture?), think of them ahead of time and look for ways to work them in.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2I5XqMDzaa	just go in and pretend ur talking to a friend ( dont be rude tho lol) and be urself, if u dont no an answer to a question just say "i have so much to learn and i no ur school can help me learn it"
TNTFomKeaa	Of course you should try and get in. Why try? Well, if you don't try, you won't get in. Definitely. You will miss out on all the good things about being in the club. If you do try, worst case scenario is that you don't get in. However, you still learn something by writing the essay, so that's a bonus. Of course, you might just get in and think how pleased you will be and how great the club is going to be. Don't worry about what your sister does. You will be pleased for her if she gets in, just like she will be pleased for you.<br>  So, writing the essay. Get a good topic and make a plan. Do some research if necessary. Then just sit down and write it. The most important stage is editing. If you think you're not that great at writing, that's most likely because you are skipping this stage. Read the whole thing aloud and you will notice if anything sounds awkward or strange. You can check your spelling and grammar at the same time. It's ok to have someone else read it and give you feedback as long as they don't actually write any of it for you.<br>  Good luck! I hope you get in!|`|2nhgdRxvaa	Well which club it was would be nice to know, but as long as it doesn't bother with all of your other stuff you should write it.

LVZdzPmpaa	"In good faith" means that you have good intentions, that you are up front about your plans. It means the same in any situation; real estate has nothing to do with it.<br>  <br>  Let's say someone asked you to do some work for them and promised to pay you later. You do the work "in good faith" that you will indeed be paid.<br>  <br>  If you are interested in buying a house, you put down some earnest money, which is a show of "good faith:" that you intend to proceed with the steps required to actually buy the house.<br>  <br>  "In good faith" means that you are on the up and up and have no slimy, ulterior motives.|`|BGY1TX64aa	It means that if the seller (or lender) is aware of something with the property (or the loan documents) that would adversely affect the buyer, they must disclose it to you. This comes up in 'good faith estimates' of closing costs legally required by lenders in many states. Also, states have disclosure laws to protect a buyer from buying a property where the seller knew there was radioactive gas coming out of the toilet or something like that, and never told you. If you get stung with something like that after you closed on the deal, you may well be able to sue the seller for non-disclosure and failing to deal 'in good faith.'<br>  <br>  As a buyer, you too must deal in good faith. But generally, your earnest money deposit insures that you follow through on what you said you would do, or else, you lose your money. Good faith is typically more important to the buyer coming from the seller or lender than the other way around.

x5VxxH4taa	Music and movement need not be only making music.  Try putting on a song that is fast and ask the children to move their bodies to the fast beat.  Encourage them, and show them how you would move your body.  Then play a medium speed song, and ask them to move their bodies to this song.  Finally play a really slow song and ask them to move to that song.<br>  After they have gotten comfortable moving their bodies, play all different kinds of music for them, and make a game out of it- Freeze Dance.<br>  Everytime you stop the music the children have to do a pose.  Try not to show them how to do the pose, but if they need help then go for it.<br>  Some examples of poses are:<br>  Super Tall Pose- reach up to the sky<br>  Teenie Tiny Pose- crouch down into a ball<br>  Star Pose- Stretch arms and legs to make a star<br>  and you can use different animal poses and see what they come up with.<br>  Also get scarves at a dollar store; just little squares of material and play slow music, have the children move their bodies and scarves to the music.<br>  Lastly look up the song Sleeping Bunnies by Eagle E, Action Amanda And The Shlepp Crew.  Album: Eagle E, Action Amanda And The Shlepp Crew on iTunes, and play this towards the end of your activity.<br>  Have the children crouch down and 'sleep' then do the actions of the song.<br>  <br>  I teach dance to 2-9 year olds (different classes obv,) and they love these activities, the little ones can't get through a class with out freeze dance and sleeping bunnies!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|2d7EDdQcaa	just make morracas and let the kids shake them to the beat of the song.

Here some that our kids enjoy:<br>  * free movement to music...scarves, pom poms, streamers, etc.<br>  *  We have foam alphabet mats that they put together, sometimes in abc order, sometimes not.  Sometimes in a rectangle, sometimes not...if you have a larger group, I would suggest you use a larger area and spread out the letters...you can even tape laminated letters to the floor.  Rhythms on Parade by Hap Palmer is a great CD for music and movement and one of his songs is Marching Around the Alphabet.  My 2-5 year olds LOVE this activity.  <br>  *  On the same CD there is a song calle The Mice Go Marching... it is great for soft/quiet movements and large/loud movements<br>  *  the parachute is always a hit...we move according the song. Very benefitial to make your own CD of songs of various tempos.<br>  *  Bean bag songs-activities...check your local library for bean bag song cd's.<br>  *  Cut out the inside of a paper plate and have the kids cut different size strips of colorful paper and staple it to the out side of the plate...they love using these with music.<br>  *  The "Freeze" song is perfect for this age group.<br>  *  Make your own rhythm instruments and form a "marching band".<br>  *  I turn on a "waltz-y" type of song and give them wax paper to "skate" around the room with.<br>  *  Dr. Jean has some great songs out there such as A Tooty Ta that is perfect for this age.<br>  *  pretending to be certain kinds of animals and moving from one area to the other.  <br>  <br>  Have you searched this online?  I'm sure there is an abundance of ideas out there for you!

gIEWfDj3aa	Based on how you wrote this question, I would advise you to avoid AP English - you need to go back to 7th grade English.  <br>  <br>  That aside, if what you want is college credit then I would say you have to look at the results in your school - with the available teachers.  Many students who pass AP courses, do not get a high enough score on the AP test to earn college credit.  Results vary significantly by  teacher.  Find out the success rates for the offerings at your school and select accordingly.  Good luck.|`|HJR5ZCpHaa	Take AP English. It's more important than history. ;)|`|syO08G5Daa	I would suggest you take both(that's what I'm doing now). With AP-LANG you don't do a lot of studying but a lot of writing. However, AP US History also known as APUSH does require studying and the memorization of dates and such. And you must read documents and write essays as well. I don't find it terribly hard, you just need time. If you are determined take them both. If not then ask yourself which subject you like better and have a passion for?

The money got from adult admissions is 3A, where A is the number of adults...for example if 8 adults buy tickets at $3 each, the total is 8*3=$24.  And the money got from children admissions is 1C, or just C, for example 23 children at $1 each is $23.<br>  <br>  So, A + C = 410, that is adults + children = 410 total.<br>  <br>  And, 3A + C = 710<br>  <br>  But the numbers lead us to the conclusion that there are minus 1227 kids, and 1637 adults.

z6BonrGvaa	Ok if you will read this closely I can explain a very simple way to do any problems involving percentages. <br>  Divide the final number by 100. When you do this you are getting the number down to 1% of the original number. Then to reach any percentage of the original number simply multiply the 1% you got by the percentage you want your number to be. <br>  For example:<br>  Your question says the final number is 30. So you divide 30 by 100= .3<br>  So .3 is 1% of thirty.<br>  Then your problem says that 1/5 have brown eyes. <br>  So convert 1/5 to a decimal. (100 divided by 5= 20) so 1/5 = .20<br>  and .20 = 20%<br>  Back to the problem now you have .3 as the 1% and you want it to be 20% so multiple .3 by 20=6<br>  so 6 is 20% of all the students.<br>  Therefore A. is 20% and B. is 6.<br>  <br>  Now lets pretend you problem stated that 40% of the class had blue eyes and they want to know how many kids have blue eyes. So divide 30 by 100 = .3 (1% of 30) then multiply .3 by 40 (because that's the percentage they want) .3X40=12<br>  so 12 would be your answer.<br>  The same formula will work no matter what percent you are looking for.<br>  Let me know if you need any more help!<br>  <br>  ~Shelby|`|eJO4OC2saa	One fifth of 30 means you have to multiply one fifth by 30.

Columbia’s academic requirements and institutional policies make completion of all graduation requirements in a reasonable and timely fashion unlikely. <br>  <br>  Harvard College<br>  Has suspended indefinitely its transfer admissions process.

Both part- and full-time students at accredited two- and four-year colleges may seek transfer admission consideration. Because Brown requires degree candidates to complete a minimum of two years in residence and in full-time study, students with more than two years of college credit are discouraged from making transfer application. Students who are currently enrolled in a dual program or an early admission program should contact the admission office before submitting an application. <br>  <br>  Darthmouth<br>  Incoming transfer students should contact the Registrar immediately once an offer of admission is accepted in order to begin the transfer credit evaluation process.

A few people I know are currently going/planning on going to pharmacy school and they have each spent at least 3 years in a 4-year school majoring in a science (I know of a chemistry major...and biology) and then Pharmacy school takes about another 4 years (I think). If it is anything like med school, though, as long as you take the prerequisites it doesn't matter what you major in. There are actually a lot of people being accepted into medical school who do not have a science degree.<br>  <br>  That's my ramble. Sorry if I'm no help
54ee904ce0957cabc081644147eab797aa	Example:<br>  <br>  Given:  5x2 + 11 + 2<br>  <br>  Find the product ac:  (5)(2) = 10<br>  <br>  Think of two factors of 10 that add up to 11:  1 and 10<br>  <br>  Write the 11x as the sum of 1x and 10x:  5x2 + 1x +  10x + 2<br>  <br>  Group the two pairs of terms:  (5x2 + 1x) +  (10x + 2)<br>  <br>  Remove common factors from each group:  x(5x + 1) + 2(5x + 1)<br>  <br>  Notice that the two quantities in parentheses are now identical. That means we can factor out a common factor of (5x + 1):  (5x + 1)(x + 2)|`|UDKLeWd2aa	x2 + 2x -8<br>  ( x + 4 ) (x - 2 ) <br>  <br>  x2 + 15x + 50<br>  ( x  + 10 ) ( x + 5 )<br>  <br>  x2 - 6x - 8<br>  this question could be wrong<br>  <br>  <br>  anyways the way to these question is by thinking 2 numbers that will multiply to give you the last number and at the same time would add to give you the middle number alright,|`|zXAuoPOSaa	For each of these, you want to find two numbers that when added together ( they may be positive or negative numbers) equal the middle term in the problem and when multiplied (again, either positive or negative) equal the last number. So, to set up the first problem:<br>  <br>  (x +/- ?) (x +/- ?)<br>  - Two numbers that would equal 2 when added together in this particular problem are 4 and -2.<br>  - Two numbers that would equal -8 when multiplied together in this problem also be 4 and -2.<br>  <br>  So, plug in these two numbers (respectively in each set of parentheses... (x + 4) (x - 2) = x(squared) + -2x + 4x - 8.<br>  You get this result when you apply the distributive property or FOIL method (Multiply in this order: Front, Outer, Inner, Last)<br>  <br>  Add like-terms and your answer is what your started out with x(squared) + 2x -8<br>  <br>  So, your real answer is (x + 4)(x - 2)<br>  <br>  Follow these steps for the rest of the problems.|`|0zriLTZXaa	1. You have to see what multiplies to -8 but subtracts to 2 because when you multiply a negative and a posotive it is always negative.<br>  2. 4 and 2 will work. (x-2)(x+4)<br>  3. I made the 4 posotive because, you want a posotive 4. If you made it a negative 4 it will be x^2-2x-8.<br>  4. Same for all the other questions.|`|0jWVcpW2aa	(x+2)(x-4)<br>  (x+5)(x+10)

Vt1ZACkDaa	STEM CELL RESEARCH!<br>  <br>  it's a awesome topic. i had to do 3 silmiliar assignments over the last two years and stem cell research was the way! not a lot of people choose it cause it is a fairly new and unknown subject. but once you start doing you research, you actually find the topic very interesting and you learn new stuff. it doesn't sound as complicated as it looks.|`|NdrO7u79aa	Definitely. Just this morning (8/9) Obama repealed Bush's ban on public funding for embryonic stem cell research. It's been a pretty debated issue, and there are a lot of sources since it's so recent.|`|jgDaMazWaa	There's plenty of stuff out there, but it depends on what you are interested in.  You could write about obama lifting the stem cell research bans, the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, the ongoing conflict in Israel, or barbie's new tattoo. :-)  I don't know how much this will help you, but it may get you started on some new trains of thought.

ZLTCPEpbaa	Ok<br>  <br>  The left ventricle's purpose is to pump blood to the whole body, while the right ventricle's purpose is to pump blood to the lungs (which is very close to the heart).<br>  <br>  Cos the Left Ventricle needs waaaay more pressure to build up in it for blood to go all over the body, it needs thicker walls to create a bigger pressure.|`|wtVSTuSuaa	You can't find this anywhere? The right ventricle only has to pump the blood to the lungs, a short distance away. While the left ventricle pumps the blood through the rest of the body from head to toe.|`|SIFXeYuoaa	im not 100% sure, but pretty darn close.  i think its because the blood goes from the left ventricle to the aorta, so it needs to be bigger to pump more blood.  good luck-i hope its right!!

Nobodies has the added meaning of "no people of any consequence."<br>  <br>  "No bodies" means that there are no bodies, meaning human forms, there. (Usually human though it could mean animal, too.) For example, "There were no bodies at the morgue."<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|jgPJtlEaaa	In that sentence - 'nobodies'.<br>  For no bodies - that's like , "Where are the bodies? There are no bodies here."|`|DkFoX4pHaa	nobodies.   It is one word.   See your dictionary.|`|AA12063813	nobodies
2nhgdRxvaa	A high school diploma is usually better especially if your school is scoring at 750 API or above, but a GED will be fine for college. All state colleges will accept your GED as well as most lower class Private colleges. <br>  <br>  BUT, in a competitive college they will pick high school graduates over GED owners because of the whole social aspect, AP testing aspect, recommendations, and other little things.|`|2EIH11m8aa	I would say that if you are going to get your GED be prepared to explain why you got it instead of finishing high school.  You can really do anything you want with a GED that you can do with a regular high school diploma. Colleges might not like it as much because you didn't actually finish high school which is why you should have a good reason to do it instead of you just don't want to go to school anymore.  Once you are in the community college you can transfer to anywhere that deems you are a good match for their school whether it be in state or out of state.  I would suggest just finishing but you can do whatever you want.|`|m45R3s5Daa	stay in HS. the ged is harder to pass. a diploma opens up more doors but a ged is ok.<br>  go check out the ged book before you decide to drop HS.<br>  <br>  good luck and yes you can go to college with a ged.|`|ImnZzaRCaa	my boyfriend did the same.<br>  <br>  Its equivalent to a highschool diploma-you will have the same benefits as a hs. diploma. Go get it!<br>  <br>  yes you can transfer.|`|aQCrmz8Yaa	the GED is qualified to replace a high school diploma. so yes, you can go to college.  Depending on where you live you might not be able to get a GED if you are enrolled in high school but your state may have a proficiency exam instead(tests you out of high school early)  California does, the CHSPE<br>  I see no real advantages to leaving high school early.  I know several people that did and none of them are happy.  One is a vastly over-worked and stressed out 17-year-old boy, the other is a bitter 22 year old, and one ended up dropping out of college.<br>  High school is to help you learn to co-exist with people in a work place environment, be assigned tasks and follow through on time.<br>  Also, leaving high school early(I say leaving not graduating because you aren't graduating you are testing out) means you will miss out on many fun events with your friends.  Yes, you have them even if you think you don't.  They are there, you just might not see them.  Prom, grad practice, grad night.  Getting ready together, talking about the future, even maybe taking a road trip over the summer as a last hurrah.<br>  I was so bitter during my Senior year due to family problems I shunned my friends and I wish I could go back and really enjoy my senior year, because now I see how i could have.  I also see how i could have made my high school friendships more lasting than they were.<br>  You can transfer to the college of your choice from a community college so long as you apply and they accept it.  However, to reduce tuition fees you might want to move there and start at a cc in that state so when it comes time to transfer it will save you a LOT of money(even out-of-state tuition at a cc is very expensive)<br>  oh also, if you go to a CC, colleges don't give a rats behind whether you have a diploma, ged, placed out or w.e. or if you took the SAT and got a 200 or a 1800 on it so long as you meet the min.  transfer requirements for that college which can be found on their site.(usually 60 transferable units following a set standard of general education classes and a certain min gpa)<br>  well i think that is all I have to say on the matter

UA8USXFNaa	Well, first of all it is very difficult to get into universities like Oxford and Cambridge. They only accept the best, so even getting in there is seen as a major accomplishment. <br>  <br>  Second - it is actually harder to get degrees from certain universities. Please note - this is NOT about the marking. Unlike what another poster said, certain universities do not have easier marking systems - everything is checked by an independent body, and if they think universities are giving marks that are too low or high they can change not only individual marks but also the marks received by a whole class. There have been cases where the whole class of 100 or so students have their grades dropped by 5% or so. So it is not possible to use an easier marking system. Similarly the essay and exam questions are checked by an independent body so it is not possible to give students easy questions.<br>  <br>  From my own experience of knowing various people in Oxbridge, good redbrick and ex-poly universities, the big difference is in workload. I am constantly shocked by how little in terms of essays and coursework is expected of people I know in certain ex-poly universities. This doesn't mean that the work is easier, just that they have longer to spend on it and so are more likely to do it well. They also seem to have much longer to spend on revising prior to exams, and a longer period to write assessed extended essays. People who go to similar universities to me - good, top twenty redbrick uni's - tend to have much heavier workloads and so find it more difficult to spend the time on assessed essays and revision. From what I know of Oxbridge they are in another league entirely when it comes to workload, with a couple of essays and masses of reading and seminar preparation every week. So, much less time to spend on assessed work.<br>  <br>  I'm sure that other people will disagree with me on this, but it's just my own observations. Just as an example, in my uni 5% of students on my course get a first. In the ex-poly down the road, 20% on the same course get a first. I think it's a fair assumption - given that the ex-poly requires CCD and my uni requires AAA - that this is not due to the fact that the students there are on average much stronger academically. Obviously A levels aren't everything, but I think they're a fairly strong indicator.<br>  <br>  One final thing I would say though is that a first is always prestigious, not matter where you get it from. A lot of people could be given a year to write an essay and still not be able to get it to a first class standard. So, although two students with 2:1s from Oxford and an ex-poly respectively might be treated very differently by certain employers, anyone with a first will be viewed favourably. That is to say the person with a first from Oxford would always be preferred, but the person with a first from an ex-poly would be preferred over the person with a 2:1 from Oxford. Also I would say that, except in a few industries such as law, investment banking etc, most employers don't seem to care at all where your degree is from. Hope this is of some help.|`|cae2a17c25e7a1c76d057e7937dd807caa	Easy answer...they're not different.<br>  <br>  Debatable answer...the Ivy League schools are usually more selective in their admissions process, and offer more stringent graduation requirements.  Their courses are also regarded higher because of the quality of instruction that they are able to afford to offer with the higher tuition rates.|`|2292675077dae921390116e7862cc989aa	Why?---They should not.<br>  <br>  Why do they?

WAY7oeQjaa	I know exactly what you are talking about! I have to take my F.C.A.T today! The best breakfast to have is cereal and fruit. For a drink, have anything that has a citrus taste. For exercise, the volleyball game will NOT do you any good! Instead, right before you take the test, do something I like to call Brain Gym.<br>  <br>                                 How to Do Brain Gym <br>  1) Take your right hand and tap it on the opposite shoulder. Do the same with the left hand, repeat 5 times.<br>  <br>  2) Now take your right foot and but it behind yourself, you have to bend your knee to do step 2. When you are in this position, take the opposite hand, and tap your ankle. Do the same with the opposite hand and feet. Repeat 5 times.<br>  <br>  3) Lift your knee and tap it with your opposite hand. Do the same with the opposite. Repeat 5 more times.<br>  <br>  4) This step is just like step 3. All you have to do is when your hand comes to touch your knee; you have to do a little hop.<br>  <br>  Brain Gym makes your blood flowing and gets you rejuvenated. This can make you more focused.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|TTwrnbY0aa	Um hey honey exercise can stimulate you if that what you are talking about. A good breakfast would include things high in protein (like eggs, nuts, yogurt and cottage cheese), carbohydrates because they release the majority of the energy used by your brain....do not eat a big meal though! Let it be a light meal because big meals make you drowsy. Avoid caffeine, juices, sugary things and stay hydrated. Bring you some little snacks to munch on (protein bar, pretzel, crackers, bag of assorted fruit..).

In my school they made English a compulsory subject up until the end of fifth year!|`|JwQPsDcdaa	Wasnt complusory when I did my highers (about 5-6 years ago). However, different schools may have different rules so your best to check with your advisor. Also, its worth researching universities/careers that you are considering as many have higher maths as a requirement i.e. my uni course asked for B grade higher maths even though it wasnt the subject im studying.|`|Gx1ewGOFaa	No, Maths is only compulsory up to Standard Grade.<br>  <br>  Once you get past that, your only constraints are timetable clashes. Apart from that, you can take whatever you want.
4ab2ea36c0069d71d94055356c32ea00aa	First thing I did was look at their web site.  They are a member of the American Montessori Society, so that is a good start.  A school that is either an AMS or AMI (Association Montessori International) is at least subject to certain standards.<br>  <br>  That doesn't mean it's automatically a good or a bad school.  What you're going to have to do is go observe the school and the classroom and see what it is like.  There is a great checklist on the following page that talks about what to look for in a Montessori school.  You might want to copy/paste that into a word document, print it out, then look at it before and after you visit the school.  Here's a link to it and it's about half way down on the page:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mothering.com/discussions/showthread.php?t=857466" rel="nofollow">http://mothering.com/discussions/showthr...</a><br>  <br>  Look for Sierra's post on it.  It would be good to read the rest of them, too.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope it's a good match.  Usually, if a school is that large, has AMS and/or AMI teachers, covers that many ages, and is recognized by either AMS or AMI, it will USUALLY be a good school.  Just from their web site, I would say it is worth a shot looking into.

Not a lot you can do about it.  Do they have parent observation day or anything of that nature?  You can't do a whole lot because you are a student (and therefore don't know squat, that's why you're in school, right!?).  <br>  <br>  Maybe you can talk one of your parents to observe your classes.  I got to do that for my son when he had issues.  But your parents have to be extremely diplomatic and have some influence in the community.<br>  <br>  My son and I were not that lucky.  Our influence was his intelligence.  He was and is exceedingly bright.  He brought home tons of awards and medals at math competitions.  So I made noises like we were going to switch schools.

High grades and test scores are a must, but everyone applying has those, and Harvard takes less than 7% of applicants, and some of those will have either good family connections or something outstanding on their resume, so the 'average' great student will have about a 5% chance of getting in.  Outstanding things include best-selling author, major Hollywood star, Intel/Westinghouse winner, original scientific research, major record contract, starting a successful business or non-profit, running for elected office outside of school, things like that.  That increases your chances, but nothing is a guarantee.|`|T526fAIeaa	EXTRA CURICULAR ECTIVITIES<br>  EXTRA CURICULAR ACTIVITIES<br>  EXTRA CURICULAR ACTIVITIES|`|zRH530kqaa	SAT SCORES<br>                  Reading     Math        Writing<br>                  25% 75%  25% 75%  25%  75% <br>  Harvard  700  800  700  790  700  790<br>  <br>  <br>  Those are the SAT scores for 25% to 75% of their applicants that means the middle 50% so 25% are smarter than that and the lower 25% are outstanding or know somebody.
3726d1854b574e48b3a07e7f5d71e489aa	It largely depends on a college's admissions policies.  If a college focuses on attracting local students, then yes - if not, then no.  As someone who has worked for a university admissions department (though, for a private school), we didn't care if someone was in state or out of state as long as they met the academic standards and could pay for their tuition and fees.<br>  <br>  Contact the schools you are inquiring about (or have a friend do it if you think they'll retain the fact that you called and will bias it against you - I doubt that would happen) and find out what their admissions offices say about it.|`|XFYtWwejaa	not unnecessarily.

t7vVF2BKaa	I agree with Carrie R about AP Biology--I took that class in high school. Pre-AP sounds like it would be an Honors class, or a class more difficult than a regular biology class, that would prepare you for going into AP Biology. You can call your school and speak to a counselor or someone in administration that would be able to answer that question definitively for you.|`|eJO4OC2saa	AP biology is Advanced Placement. It should be a high school class taught at a college level. At the end of the course, you should be allowed to take a placement test in order to qualify for college credits.  Also, if your school offers it, taking an AP class can give you five points for getting an A instead of 4 as usual! Great way to boost GPA!<br>  <br>  Before taking this class, ask yourself if you are ready for a rigorous challenging course in biology. If you generally like biology a lot and make good grades, go for it! If not, take regular.  I had a 3.94 in High school and did not take AP bio because I hated science. But I did take AP calculus, AP Spanish, and AP US History. I started college with 9 credit hours - almost sophomore status!!!

78bc7bd297176d2f8cd74f4d7ea29febaa	A story within a story is a literary device or conceit in which one story is told during the action of another story. <br>  <br>  The inner stories are told either simply to entertain or more usually to act as an example to the other characters. In either case the story often has symbolic and psychological significance for the characters in the outer story. There is often some parallel between the two stories, and the fiction of the inner story is used to reveal the truth in the outer story.<br>  <br>  The literary device of stories within a story dates back to a device known as a frame story, when the outer story does not have much matter, and most of the bulk of the work are one or more complete inner stories told by one or more fictional storytellers.|`|WRFvfBExaa	Somtimes when something like reasons or why things happened, etc. are unknown in the 'main' or large story, authors will tell little stories in their large ones that parallel the events of the large one. For example, say there was a story about a race, and about how the slowest kid beat the fastest one (I know, this im overly simplifying it). Then say, the slow kid meets up with the astounded fast kid, and he starts telling the other boy a story about rabbits and turtles. In the story, the turtle beats the rabbit in a race because he was cunning and he cut corners, or whatever. <br>  <br>  This would be a logical parallel to the actual race the two boys had. In this case, it would be safe to assume that the slow kid really was cunning, and that he did cut corners and not got the whole track.<br>  <br>  ^^ thats about the only reason why, i can think. I hope i didn't just confuse you more!

6SasHFPBaa	This is pretty simple, both to research on Google or just to figure out.<br>  <br>  Sulfur is #16 on the periodic table.  That means its atomic number is 16, which means there are 16 electrons total.  <br>  <br>  In the outer energy level (valence shell), there are 6 electrons (6 valence electrons).  To figure this out:<br>  <br>  shell 1 - 2 electrons<br>  shell 2 - 8 electrons<br>  That's 10.  <br>  16 total - 10 in first two shells = 6 valence<br>  <br>  Also, to figure out the valence, look at the group number of the element, and the units digit of the group number is the number of valence electrons.  Very helpful trick! :)|`|ktBCSnFLaa	Sulfur is the 16th element in the periodic table. That means that it always had 16 protons (or else it wouldn't be sulfur!). In order to balance the charge of 16 positive protons, 16 electrons are needed. Of course, sulfur, being near the end of a table row, often attracts additional electrons, creating an S- ion (18 electrons, at which point all orbits are full).<br>  <br>  Outer ring electrons... sulfur is in the 3rd row, so it has 3 ring levels. On the first is 1 S-orbit, filled with 2 electrons. 2nd row has another S-orbital, as well as a P-Orbital (6 electrons in a dumbbell arrangement). The last row has a 3rd S-orbital (full), and a 2nd P-Orbital (4 of 6 electrons in place). When you add it all up, there's 2+2+6+2+4=16. Generally, there are 16 electrons.|`|Z65KWSInaa	16 total.  inner ring 2, middle ring 8, outer ring 6|`|iFBZA9mxaa	7|`|4aedd20a8fc9ba5471c436d8bd9eade6aa	16

YipD1QKFaa	I think your teacher was talking about Cerberus, the multi-headed dog that guards the gates of Hades in Greek and Roman mythology.<br>  <br>  Greek mythology and art generally depict Cerberus as having three heads, a mane of live snakes, and the tail of a dragon.  The three heads are though to represent the past, the present, and the future.  They three heads may also represent birth, youth, and old age.  Each of Cerberus' heads is said to have an appetite only for live meat.  Cerberus was always employed as Hades' loyal watchdog, and guarded the gates that granted access and exit to the underworld.|`|AA10097817	Three dog night.

Fs1bgP4Uaa	Well done. That's an absolutely amazing story and you have every right to brag about it if you want! Really, congrats. I hope you do get into university. <br>  <br>  I've had a similar experience. I wan't a 'troublemaker' but I hated school, didn't study and I hardly ever attended. I had other problems too and had to see a psychiatrist. I told her that I wanted to go to Cambridge University and she said 'Well it's not as if you're going to get all As and A*s, is it?'A while after that, I got a scholarship to a private school and I started working hard and getting all As and A*s. The teachers at my school said that I was definitely 'Cambridge material' and that there's a chance that I'll be able to go there.
2EIH11m8aa	I would suggest that you start looking for financial aid from the school and other sources if you really want to go there.  Even a little financial aid might be the difference between you going and not.  I would say that your parents have the final call though because you are probably going to be paying for some sort of higher education right after that and that is a big debt to deal with especially with the economy as it is right now.

jwAJOJOeaa	It depends on what internship. Most of the questions for a first round of interviews are behavioral mostly about your educational background and work experience. Practice difficult questions. Popular ones are: What is your weakness? Tell me about a time when you worked in a group.|`|GrtmOc3Eaa	Not all internships are created equal. Some involve dedicated training, exposure to managers, and significant responsibility. Others involve making copies and getting coffee. <br>  How do you make sure you're getting a good deal when you sign on for an internship? Take the time during your interview to make sure you understand what's involved in the internship by asking these questions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Can you give me an example of my summer responsibilities? Try to make sure the answer you receive is as specific as possible. Particularly if you're new to the industry, you want to ensure that you will perform work that is representative of a full-time associate.

What's it like to be a CCNA? CCNP? CCIE? <br>  <br>  I love computers and am driven by the idea of setting up and maintaining large networks. I feel awestruck when I stand in front of a large server rack sending hundreds of cat5's up in the ceiling. <br>  <br>  I've spent the last 6 years in front of a monitor designing websites and it's already taking it's toll on this 22 year old's back, posture, and wrists. I'm really looking to get away from sitting down for 40 hours a week. <br>  <br>  This is why I need to know. What's your job like? How much do you get paid? What's a typical day at the office like? How many hours do you typically work per week? Anything you like/don't like about working in networking? <br>  <br>  I'm currently working towards an Associates in networking, a CCNA and hope to persue a CCNP after that and if I like it enough, push for a CCIE. Any particularly good/bad points about this strategy? Your opinion is very valuable to me. Please let me know.

Putting the title of a book in quotes is acceptable if neither of those are available.<br>  <br>  Oh, and you need a period at the end.<br>  <br>  The phrase "this book I'm holding up here" is awkward and probably redundant.  The only reason you'd want "up here" in the phrase is to call attention away from something going on somewhere else in the area - probably not what you meant.  I'd use one of the following sentences:<br>  <br>  This book is "Secrets in the Fire."<br>  The book I'm holding is "Secrets in the Fire."<br>  This book is titled "Secrets in the Fire."<br>  The book I'm holding up is "Secrets in the Fire."<br>  The title of the book I'm holding is "Secrets in the Fire."

Also note that you can appear for 2 re-tests at the most. If you get less then 33% in more than 2 tests, the board will fail you directly without giving you a chance to appear for any retest. Actually yesterday's test was awfully easy and i don't think any one is gonna flunk in it but since the paper was quite lengthy. i guess it's going to be tough to score 95+
