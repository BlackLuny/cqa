I do have a big butt though.   another instance: i used to play piano and i was quite well at it. However i recently quit and when people ask me why and ask me queostions about it, i turn bright red.    maybe it just turns bright red when im even just a little bit uncomforable. im not sure. but it happens very often.       how can i make it stop? especially when im speaking in front of the class. any suggestions?

It just started peeling today and I'm aware that's normal. The tattoo is about 6in x 4.5in and no color. I know that everyone heals differently and healing time always varies but I was wondering, how much time would you guess I had until I stop peeling? Few days, weeks?    Also, I want a bit of extra detail in there. The picture the artist went off of (a pic of my dog, r.i.p), was one of him in the sun so his features were a bit washed out. Should I wait until after I have healed completely or just on the surface to get this added?   Thnx.

There is this certain style that I fell in love with while looking up hairstyle pictures online. I know a curling iron wouldn't work, because I don't think the curling iron would give me the amount of body and volume that this look requires. So, I was thinking that a wet set with 1?"-diameter magnetic rollers might work in achieving this look? What do you guys think? What would you suggest?

I feel like my youth is slipping away so fast.  the big 30 is coming up, it's not even here and I want to cry. I don 't feel like I have accomplished ANYTHING.  I'm not married, we rent, I have 3 kids, I'm totally unappreciated at work, I didn't get my degree.  I feel like a failure- there are people my age buying houses! Okay so I have been feeling rather angst about this whole getting older thing but at least I always had my youthful appearance.  I've been lucky to always look younger than I am. That is until the other day.  My future father in law doesn't have a clue that some of the things that come out of his mouth are rude and I let it go. So I picked up our kids from their house the other day and he looks right at me and says "yep your looking older!, Your looking much older."  I was floored-BLAGHHHHHHHHH!  I wanted to cry, like... excuse me are you for real!?  No way. I look great, I look like a teenager still, I'm thin and blond and... I guess I look really old now!  I can't stop thinking about what he said.  He is obviously honest so what am I going to do about it?  I need a game plan here.  I'm turning 30 next year - does this mean I have to break out the granny panties and stick a  bag over my head? I did my make up today but I still felt like I look old.  Bottom line I am not ready to age gracefully- I want to look great no matter what age I am.

20090223002411AABN1xe	Beauty & Style;Hair	Why is my hair naturally so colorful?	I have never dyed my hair, and I don't think cool-aid randomly makes its way to my shampoo bottle so I was just wondering.      I had whiteish blonde hair when I was very young, strawberry blonde growing up, and dirty blonde for a majority of my life. But over the past several years I've been getting streaks of hair with a wide range of colors, people that don't know me very well actually think I dye my hair. As I type this nearly half of my head is a large assortment of blonde colors (from really bright yellow to reddish blonde to dark blonde), the other half is an assortment of browns (some almost black) with a few signs of red. Even looking at an individual strands, some will be multicolored, others will be just one color.      Could it have something to do with my heritage? I'm about as much as a mutt as they come, and no certain hair color is dominate on either side of my family; but none has natural highlights/lowlights that stand out nearly as much as mine that I know of. Did I get into some toxic waste I don't know of; I do have that kind of luck. I do like the hair, I'm just curious.

20090223022615AAWQBJG	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	How on earth does anyone manage to walk in heels? Are there any tips to prevent falling/looking like I'm crazy?	On Saturday I bought myself a pair of 'Nine West' heels. They're sort of platform at the front then with an inch wide and approximately 5 inch tall heel. They were in the sale and I couldn't resist.      I debuted them yesterday and it took me 30 minutes to walk to a destination which would have normally taken 10 minutes. I probably looked a bit stupid too staggering about trying to remain upright. I wore tights with them and wonder if this was a mistake (and I should have gone barefoot) as the nylon seemed to make my feet slide about inside the shoes.      Then on the way back to the car I fell full length of the pavement. Ouch! And totally embarrassing!      Any tips on how to walk in heels? Is barefoot best? How on earth Does Victoria Beckham manage it? Am I destined to be a scruffy Converse wearing chick forever?      Help me please! Thanks in advance :)

20090223021809AAAcLEe	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Is there anything i can take to make getting a tattoo hurt less.?	People have told me some Advil might help a bit, but i was thinking more along the lines of vicodin or pain killers of some sort? Would popping vicodin an hour before or so eliminate the pain, or would i just sort of have a body high? Is there anything out there i can pop to make the pain much less? And i want something reasonable, i dont want too be all loopy and high.
