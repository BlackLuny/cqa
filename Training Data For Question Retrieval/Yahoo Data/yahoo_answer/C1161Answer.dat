I don't know, I just didn't like it.<br>  <br>  I now use a mascara a friend recommended, Artistry control mascara, and I would give that an 11/10, lol :D! It's bloody amazing, mate! The brush control is phenomenal and it hardly ever flakes or smudges. Also, it lasts for many many hours, so I don't reapply much throughout most days, which makes it last longer. (I also use Artistry's mascara, so both work really well together for me.) Anyway, I buy it directly from the website (pasted below), since it's cheaper than from the store, I believe. You should definitely give it a try.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps, mate! ^_^|`|3snkJHuXaa	No, you should not use this.it is not good for good for hair.use zoom tip eye liner
OJWApbmbaa	Depends usually half an hour or a full hour if I have to take a shower. i pick out my outfits the night before.|`|ajK4OLROaa	50 min to 65 min|`|blwDnJy4aa	Before school, it usually takes me about thirty minutes to get ready, but that's without a shower. With a shower, it will take me about 45.<br>  <br>  If I'm going out on the weekends to somewhere casual, like the mall, and I've already showered, it would take me less than 30 minutes to get ready. I don't always wear makeup, so that's not any added time or anything.<br>  <br>  Basically it will take me anywhere from 30 - 45 minutes to get ready.|`|InzHK1rcaa	depends where I'm going. Is it somewhere nice? that'll take a little over an hour. Am I going to a movie? Then it'll take like 20 minutes, maybe 25 if there's a shower.|`|5kRtTmvhaa	depends, usually about half an hour if I don't shower|`|eMZthQnKaa	it usually takes me 50min to an hour, only because my hair takes long to do!

Yeq13X8iaa	Yep ! My friend bought hair color from there and her hair is a vivid orange on the top of her hair and then black on the bottom hairs, it's sooo pretty !<br>  <br>  It's inexpensive, and it works ! Lo'real is the way to go too, and from what my friend told me, works best (: Hope this helps !|`|87abb67fdea86bc93c669613a70f1f3eaa	Well depends how dark your roots are, but yes just use a lightening kit.|`|6CMfKxiMaa	yeah it will be fine|`|Z1NlYGExaa	I think it would be risky, because if you've never done it what if you do something wrong.  Also, its hard to do things to your hair so I would at least ask a friend to help.  Also, you would need to match it perfectly to still have salon look.  I've always been leery of dong things like that because I've heard horror stories about the color turing wrong.  Like orange, especially if you're doing blonde.|`|c7M1IbZ0aa	yea girl

5RjHESqyaa	Kinda...i guess?<br>  <br>  I say that because I personally think MAC is amaaaazing but there are many haters out there who think MAC is an absolute rip-off and is way over-rated. It's a professional make up line! (many models and actors use MAC)<br>  Unfortunately, it's known to cause break outs (especially the liquid foundations) because of certain ingredients they use!<br>  <br>  Well if you can afford it no harm yea?? But you could always experiment with other brands that are MUCH cheaper and are of good quality too. i.e. Smashbox, Revlon<br>  <br>  But then again, i'm a die-hard fan of MAC so you probably shouldn't listen to my one-sided opinion! Hahaha<br>  <br>  <br>  xx|`|2JQDpcZ5aa	yes, please buy mac :)<br>  it makes your makeup look soo much better! and it applies easier, stays longer ahh i could go on and on :)<br>  the hype is true, its soo much better than other makeup :)<br>  especially if you use drugstore makeup now, it will seem like heaven!<br>  <br>  hope that helps you :)|`|C0pk4kgJaa	YES! I LOVE going to mac!! It is so much fun! No one says you HAVE to buy mac, I mean some mac stuff are really duplicated easily with drug store brand but the colors are beautiful and I just love everything! Its a nice splurge if you want it :)|`|HyP41qbDaa	I just like their eyeshadows...<br>  <br>  <br>  I'd think they are. Try Coastalscents.com, though. They have eyeshadow palettes with 80 eyeshadows that are like $20. Plus they are MAC comparable. Highly pigmented.|`|RbR4DG7Xaa	High quality, their eyeshadows and lip products are very nice. :) Also, their eyeliners. However, don't get the MAC Kohl Smolder eyeliner. I have it, absolutely horrible. Smudges, creases, run, everything a bad eyeliner should do. Oh yeah, their foundations, etc. make people break out so don't get that.<br>  <br>  A little pricey, but a few good products will last you a long time.|`|MFUfXB9Caa	In my opinion, no. Its only expensive because its a professional brand and used by celebs. Theres so many other brands out there that are just as good for less than half the price.|`|JhJXKRkOaa	No, I don't think they are, there are other make-up products, that are just as good as MAC and there cheaper, much cheaper. you'll just be wasting your money, when you can put it towards something else you might want to buy.|`|fb5Njg7gaa	Absolutely
mrpj8AV9aa	get some hair wax and massage it in to your hair to give it more texture and stop it looking like a mullet.  or use hairspray to the same effect.  You will find that the shorter you have your hair, the quicker it will grow, so don't worry too much, coz in a few weeks it will have grown quite a lot!|`|Zi3u9wwKaa	go back and demand to get it fixed. they should do it for free|`|Zk5PTmrfaa	I have the same problem as you.<br>  I asked for a cute short Ashlee Simpson haircut (I brought the picture) but they did so many layers in the back and it looks like a mullet because my hair's wavy.<br>  <br>  I think you should straighten it, or put it in a pony tail like I do everyday. <br>  <br>  It will grow. :)|`|87abb67fdea86bc93c669613a70f1f3eaa	Without a pic. it's to hard to tell.|`|rYg33tSGaa	the same thing happened to me, my hair was like to my legs & it was so nice, thick & shiny the only thing made me cut it was that it had many split ends & when i cut it all women in the salon looked sad for me seeing all my hair on the floor :( that was two years ago  and since then it had never grown back..but a couple of weeks ago i tired biotin capsules i think they're effective, i've known maaaaaany weird oils like for instance "onion oil" hehe for hair from that indian gal i knew listen it worked for me " castor Oil" really it makes hair grow longer,faster & healthier oh yea she told me one more thing which honetly i haven't tried it's " 2 bananas & a kewi fruit" mix them in your blender & put them on you hair for just 15 minutes (you don't need steam) & make that every week she said that made her hair grew 7 inches after cutting it the same day i have:( sounds a bit sad! yu know what made be believe her that on the shampoo i use it's written with bananas & fruit extract, or maybe you won't like such natural things so you could go for hair extensions ..also you need to get garnier fructis shampoo long & stron really nice :) oww that was waaay too long :$ sryy:)<br>  i hope i've helped you :),<br>  Lena.
OMh4jPzjaa	yes just use a semi perm. color those are the ones that wash out in like 8 weeks.  That will help to get the brassiness out of the hair, I think one more time will get that tone out, make sure it doesn't say golden on the box, that will keep the reddish color in the hair.  Then just get regular trims, use a good shampoo and conditioner.  And remember the next time you do anything to your hair make sure to let the stylist know cause we won't know that there is a highlight under all the color and you don't want to really mess up your hair.  It will take a while for that blond to grow out when your hair grows and average of a 1/2 in a month.   The stylist may have used a bleach but not a high enough volume peroxide on it, or she should have put a toner on it to get rid of the brassiness.  It is very hard to get the platinum color especially if you have brown hair.  It is normally a two step process, of having to rebleach the sections again, and that is very hard on a persons hair, and then you have a lot of damage, and some people don't look good with those platinum highlights, but she should have told you that she couldn't do those, not pass it off as ok.  Stylists will sometimes tell you it looks great when you know it doesn't cause they don't want to have to redo their work.  You as a consumer should complain and tell them right there that isn't what you want and have them fix it, even though I know that is hard to say, but you need to be happy, not us (stylists) cause without you guys we have no job, and when you aren't happy you will tell everyone not to go there.  Or if they won't redo it, then you shouldn't have to pay.  Especially in this economy!!  <br>  hope this helps|`|sx5AZ52raa	if you plan on going lighter within the next 6-12 mos, i suggest you do a demi permanent.  thats like water proof mascara for your hair.  If your hair is colored darker than a level 5, light brown, then chances are you won't be able to get platinum hi-lites unless you use 40 volume developer...which is very unhealthy.|`|Z1NlYGExaa	You should wait  few weeks, because if you dye it too much, your hair will dry out and look fried.
6ccuJbLbaa	48 hours.|`|GqVaHA7Iaa	you should wash your hair with neutralizing shampoo as soon as the relaxer is rinsed. I don't see a problem in shampooing the hair the very next day if you hate the final hairstyle, but if thats the case you need to talk to your stylist about a refund or restyling your hair til its satisfactory.|`|f5a1KnMaaa	I have washed my hair the very next day before and it was fine. I don't see any need to wait. The relaxer will not wash out.

nTSjPOYQaa	I don't trust that stuff at all, especially after its been sitting around for so long. You should be cleaning your piercings with salt soaks instead. Mix about 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt (has to be SEA salt) with a cup of warm water until the salt dissolves. Then you can use a q-tip to dab it around the ear piercing, or you can actually dunk your ear into the cup. This is the best, and most natural way to help heal and clean a piercing.|`|XaYHMNusaa	I wouldn't use it.  That stuff isn't good for any piercings anyway.

8f7bc13b41bb64d385bed31ee79eaecdaa	you should scrub regularly...scrubbing gets rid of dead skin cells and hence helps to lighten the scars.. and try using a lightening cream on them..even i'm trying to lighten my pimple scars, and for me shahnaz husain's shagrain(scrub) and shafair(lightening cream) is really helping it. And try applying carrot juice and almond paste as a mask..that helps too:)All the best, they'll fade don worry, mine have faded!:)|`|26cc2bf90a81ad78877354496012c300aa	Acne removal:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askaquery.com/Answers/qn1551.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.askaquery.com/Answers/qn1551....</a>|`|3e15c746b774e2442deaf78d252860d5aa	You will need to see a dermatologist,and See about getting some chemical peels to maybe some laser treatments to your face.Depending on how deep and how many scars you have.And your face will be beautiful again,may be a little expensive but if you want something that will work that will.No creams or ointments will take a scar away,your just wasting time and your money seek those 2 things i mentioned to you and let me know how things turned out.Good-luck and i wish you the best!|`|AA10917838	If you are too young .. better to clean your skin regularly and never rush to get rid of them they are in fact helping your hormonal system to get balanced which will keep your body skin longer healthier later on .. but if you are above 17 better to go to laser therapist, it will  eradicate & remove all the scars and small heads .. in the mid of that you may use any scrubbing lotion or for severe cases use roaccutan from Roche .. it helps but never take it if you are expecting or liable to become pregnant ..|`|AA11723272	you can go to dermotologist and see if there is a treatment that you can out on to help with the scars or you can keep using your face cleaner to help fight the acne and maybe try proactiv it truly does work i have tried it and in i think 3-4 days my skin was looking great:)|`|f1e35408e6a3053288356a1f93b50c02aa	Scars are a tough one - that's why dermatologists always advise against squeezing. To lighten scars, you can try Vitamin E cream - but it's very slow. Or go to a dermatologist to get a prescription drug - it may cost a little more but I think it's worth buying a lot of off-the-shelf-but-doesn't-work products.

What I tell them, and what's worked best for me is to do this:  Study the bone structure of your face. Then find a celebrity that has a similar bone structure.  After you find that, look at that celeb's pics over the years.  Celeb's seem to change their hair more often than anyone else, and so you can find one that you like and have an idea of what it might look like on you.

When you love your body and know that it is merely an extention of who you are (it does not completely say who you are, it just showcases who you are in a way), you will be more confident in your daily life.

You don't want him to like him for your looks do you? I would MUCH rather have a boyfriend that likes me for me.|`|rhRPaoUYaa	The purpose of makeup is to enhance your beauty, not to make you appear older. The reason some people look older when they wear makeup is becuase they wear too much, which makes it appear as though your wearing a mask. From my standpoint this is not a very good option. My boyriend and my past boyfriends have all preffered a fresher face to a super made up one. If you want to appear older maybe you can dress a little older and act more mature. <br>  <br>  Good luck

I was in my teens in the early 1970s, influenced by Joni Mitchell's Big Yellow Taxi and the first energy crisis of 1973 when it dawned on everyone that mattered that things were running out.<br>  <br>  I was never part of the hedonistic hippie movement of drugs and being spaced out.  My generation were more natural, the early exponents of responsible sustainability, rather than blowing everything on a drug-fuelled party.  Quite a different animal to the hippies of the 1960s, but superficially I look similar - with long hair, sandals and a beard, which I have kept to this day.<br>  <br>  Rather than opting out of society, our movement's intention was to become a pillar of society, and our great champion is the Prince of Wales.  I still believe that we are what will guard so much that is far more precious than "normal" money-minded people realise, like the monks of old who worked to safeguard the Word of God from endless onslaught from barbarian raiders. Vandals.<br>  <br>  In the next village to me, there is a crafts centre called The Fold, run by an enthusiastic Green, who sold the plant nursery business he inherited from his father to fund it.  They run the Green and Away camps, a tented village conference centre where all sorts of ideas of sustainable living are discussed with long haired folk with guitars.<br>  <br>  Our movement did not start with the hippies. Pre-Raphaelites and visionaries such as Ruskin, Morris and Blake were active doing much the same things in the 19th century in reaction to the smokestack hell of inner city living then.<br>  <br>  So you are part of a proud movement far deeper and more valuable to society than the term "hippie" suggests.  Good on you!|`|h36gR2Fnaa	Oh gosh hun, <br>  When it comes to stereotypes then you match the description/<br>  BUT there is nothing wrong with it.<br>  If you feel thats who you are. Be you. Life's too short to try and be someone to please other people.<br>  I've been called a hippy.[but by this boy who has problems]<br>  So it doesn't matter be true to who are!|`|YHwAOEUYaa	eh its all good =]|`|nqhcNhTbaa	ya as a stearytype you might be but its doesnt have to be who you are cause you prob dont do things like hippies cause they were strange x 10 if u get my drift  so ya|`|IEk0UV7Haa	LOL PEACE MAN!! haha<br>  come on it's not the 60's :)<br>  <br>  Haha i love animals i'm not a hippy.<br>  Also please don't support Peta they kill more animals than they save <br>  <a href="http://www.petakillsanimals.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petakillsanimals.com/</a><br>  <br>  If you love animals don't support them :( i made that mistake!

This behavior continues despite PETA’s moralizing about the “unethical” treatment of animals by farmers, scientists, restaurant owners, circuses, hunters, fishermen, zookeepers, and countless other Americans. PETA puts to death over 90 percent of the animals it accepts from members of the public who expect the group to make a reasonable attempt to find them adoptive homes. PETA holds absolutely no open-adoption shelter hours at its Norfolk, VA headquarters, choosing instead to spend part of its $32 million annual income on a contract with a crematory service to periodically empty hundreds of animal bodies from its large walk-in freezer.
DpStw8RBaa	Despite the fact that stars are over done as far as tattoos go, I think this is really cute because of the placement. It's sassy and you can hide it when necessary. Tattoos are painful, there's no denying it, but it's not as bad as you would think. The stars are small and will not take very long; you will be fine!<br>  <br>  I think that you should be the one choosing the colors because the stars are going to be on your body, but if I were getting the tattoo done I would choose hot pink and black and make all of the stars the same colors (like this: <a href="http://userimages05.imvu.com/productdata/images_9f55cddafdef0674e05a11cd84add7db.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://userimages05.imvu.com/productdata...</a> )<br>  <br>  Good luck with your tattoo; I'm sure you will love it.|`|itbkP9HGaa	I like the layout of the 1st picture better.  The stars are cute, and the good thing is that you can always hide those if you need to!  We shouldn't pick colors for you, just pick 3 colors you think are pretty, and ones that will be vibrant against your skin.  Maybe you can talk to your tattoo artist about their professional opinion on the colors.<br>  <br>  Forgot to answer your other questions:<br>  Yes, it hurts.  Like a needle dragging across your skin really hard.  But it isn't that bad, and its over soon enough.  Much better than having a baby!|`|e2099d20a6fdd2c84c032e222b17db4faa	Cute art work.<br>  <br>  Yes tattoos hurt, actually they burn and sting. I have gotten two.  One on the shoulder, on one my cheek.<br>  <br>  Depending where the tattoos are, the site showed in the pics does not hurt as much as the top of the foot, ankle or shoulder.  The more fat and muscle at the site of the tattoo the easier the pain is to manage.  <br>  <br>  What are your favorite colors, use them.|`|AeV8KYL2aa	thats a very interesting place to put them lol<br>  i bet would hurt because its on soft tissue.. also if youre planning on getting colors that bright they will fade easily<br>  answer mine please??<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtofLiqRfsCBWoRG.QrJn1jsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227135511AALHibX">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|8WKSgeriaa	I love that tattoo<br>  Ofcourse it will hurt(tiny needles pricking you at the same time)<br>  But it's worth it<br>  I would say get like purple white and yellow or black and white<br>  Maybe pink and black +white|`|gJwEibL5aa	That tattoo would look really cute. Unfortunately, tattoos hurt no matter where you put them, but thats the price you pay if you want one done. It all depends on the area - fatty parts of the body will make the needles hurt less, it's when the tattoo needles hit the bone that really hurts. <br>  <br>  I'd make the bottom and top stars black and the one in the middle hot pink.|`|zL9Scv15aa	yeah it looks good!<br>  those kind of tatt dont hurt cause there samll and simple u would probably just feel like a pinch something similiar to do that!<br>  hmmmm about the colors i think i would get burgandi,orange,and some sort of light green|`|pqzKlNudaa	Yes it hurts and the place you choose would be cute.

I would also avoid using it on any aggregate stones such as lapis lazuli, turquoise, carnelian, agate, jade and similar soft stones usually shaped as cabochons.

I went there when I was in like 5th grade and it just sounded like a rip off-they will let you believe you can make it big as long as you pay them but they don't really get you anywhere. You can go to auditions and castings without their help. Just my advice.

Alot of times, they will advertise in the newspaper or some kind of media--radio, TV.  " Open call " is like an open audition so they can see alot of girls or guys or both at one time. Agents are usually pretty busy, so if you call them asking for an appointment to meet with them, most of the time, they will say "No, but we will be having an open call soon " or give you a date. Now if you were recommended to them by someone who already models for them, it might give you an advantage. Agents will have an "Open call" when they need new models, or are just looking for a certain type. If you do get a chance to meet with an agent or go to an open call, have some pictures made before you go. They may ask to see your " book", which would be your photo portfolio. Tell them that you haven't established a portfolio yet because you are just starting out but that you do have some photos that you can show them. So go to a photographer and have some pictures done. Black and white  head shots and a couple of  full length. Mostly black and white and a couple color. They'll want to see how you photograph. Some girls are very pretty but don't photograph very well. That's not necessarily the end because they could still use you for runway or promoyional events. If there are no reputable modeling agents around in your town, find the closest one to your town and give them a call to ask about an " open call " or you can send them a letter with your photos in an envelope with your statistics-ie-height, weight, measurements, dress size, pants size, shoe size, haircolor, eye color, age of course. Only thing about sending them a letter with photos, is that if they can't use you or lose your letter, you won't get the photos back and they probably won't contact you. You'll just be left hanging. You can call them if you don't hear from them after a month or so, and ask them if they got it. If they say they didn't or act like they've never heard of you, go back to asking about an "open call."<br>  One major thing, is make sure they are a reputable agency and not some people looking to take advantage of young girls. If you see an ad in the paper, or whatever, ask around about them to see if anyone has ever heard of them. If you're not careful, some of these so called agencies are just sleezy guys who work on their own and sell pictures to publications or to the internet. Do not sign a release form until you have someone else look at it, like your parents or someone who knows something about the industry. Once you sign a release form, they can do whatever they want with you pictures and not pay you a dime, or worse, put your picture or just your head on someone elses body and stick in a sleezy magazine or internet site and you can't do anything about it, even if you are a minor. Once these people have what they want, they are impossible to find to prosecute. <br>  Just want you to be careful. Modeling can be a tough business and you can get your feelings hurt, so if you aren't able to handle rejection, it may not be for you. But if you are persistant, and don't mind seeing more than one agent---you may not have what one agent is looking for but another agent may sign you up in a minute, go for it !! Good Luck!!!|`|AkpqXof2aa	Well, step one good genes, you  pretty much need to be tall to be successful. Then either be super skinny yet toned, or bigger yet toned.

Call your local tanning salons or simply google spray tanning with your location in mind and many searches will come up from tanning salons and beuty salons.

FSuHBCMHaa	the dandruff can be stopped with a good shampoo. Using a shampoo like head and shoulders will help with the irritation and flakiness of the scalp which is what dandruff basically is.

I would look at your diet first of all. lack of certain vitamins and proteins contribute to hair loss, the best thing you can do is to cut out junk food make sure your diet is rich in fruit and vegetables.<br>    I would also look at taking hair supplements to help with the hair loss and drink plenty of water. All these will help|`|KpQAxIAjaa	awe i am so sorry you have dandruff! but dont worry you are not alone. i had dandruff too. <br>  okay so here are a couple of things you can do:<br>  can stop scratching your head/scalp if you do<br>  start using dandruff shampoo(really helped me out!) I used the Head and Shoulders kind. It worked wonders for me.<br>  and since i had dandruff i washed my hair everyday, and make sure to shampoo your hair with only the tips of your fingers and not your fingernails!<br>  Well I hope i helped! good luck.|`|bQCfOftxaa	use Head & Shoulders (seriously it works)
X6Zf1Z8oaa	La popelina es una tela tejida al hilo y trama.  El color de la tela es uniforme. La imagen de esta tela es más formal que la mezclilla. Es una tela muy fina, delgada, sumamente fresca(el tacto de la tela es “frío”).

oAsmgOCeaa	Because vanity is a very ugly thing.  Most of the time, the person just looks silly and vain after the surgery.  Surely there must be better things on which to spend your money.<br>  That being said, you should be able to do what you want.  Just don't blame others because they think you are frivolous...they might be right.|`|0AQF8pnKaa	because that's not what you really look like and it's extremely bad for you. but it's your face you can mess it up as much as you like.|`|ZhVgTYPZaa	um<br>  michael jackson<br>  and why would you waste so much money on something that could end up screwing up your face??? donate it to charity instead.|`|wI3AAkIoaa	I believe in it... for those that don't, they have never seen a child's face that had been bit by a dog.

I think that god gave you that face and that body for a reason, he didn't give it to you to just change it!? Or else he wouldn't of made it in the first place! The only things that I would ever change w/ plastic surgery, is if it was seriously and strictly medical. :)<br>  Like someone else said, if your going to use money on a whim, atleast give it to a good cause! :)|`|Idq12DTCaa	Ive never really heard about people hating plastic surgery, but by your very aggressive writing i assume you've had it done.<br>  <br>  People don't 'hate', but I suppose its frowned upon because:<br>  <br>  Liposuction is a very risky procedure to lose weight, and because its so fast a weight loss the body is put under severe stress and skin must be tightened up. I personally believe its ridiculous because you get the same results from exercise unless you have certain issues. However, people like to take the easy way out in life and have no sense of self discipline, which is the reason they gained weight to begin with<br>  <br>  Fake boobs aren't bad, but they can be scene as tacky; a strippers thing. Then again, anything women do is scrutinized much more so than men, and as a guy even I know it.<br>  <br>  Every other form of plastic surgery is there to make you the way you want to be. however, I think that going through with a majority of it like calf implants, face lifts etc is someone trying to be something they aren't. People are letting their insecurities define them and people see that as a bad trait. Also, plastic surgery leaves scars and proof that you've been altered anyways.<br>  <br>  If you want to have plastic surgery then do it, if not then don't. But don't let others opinions choose or sway your emotions.<br>  <br>  Also the "if you don't like it don't do it, deal with it' argument is stupid. Someone used the same argument for the Jonas brothers. I hate them because they are young kids who have an actual talent at playing, yet instead of using it to make creative and original art, there instead signed up with disney and throwing out creativity to make crappy songs that in 2 years time will die out. My opinion on subjects has just as much validity as yours, so why fight it?

jBslLP64aa	low-intensity cardio workouts (exercise bike, treadmill, eleptical ) where you keep your heart rate at about 2/3 of your recommended max heart rate (google a max heart rate chart) and mixing in low weight/high rep weight work is the best way to lower your body fat percentage. as far as diet, increasing protein and vitamin-rich foods (meats and vegetables), and decreasing your carb intake (breads and cereals) will help tremendously. don't cut carbs out completely, though  - you need them for daily energy.

They would shorten your forehead and make your face look shorter.<br>  Also soft waves would look get because they would give your face more width. <br>  Also if your really daring you could get hard bangs that just graze your brow.

AuvgtbAkaa	Well, over my way, tanning per session is about $5 or $6 dollars.  that would be your better choice, then you wont get those orange streeks!  yuck!|`|nB93AT1Xaa	The place I go:<br>  <br>  $5: 20 minute bed<br>  $7: 15 minute (my favorite)<br>  $9:  10 minute bed.|`|SIuEpjQAaa	I've been to a few different tanning salons and they usually range between $4-5, but if you buy a sample of lotion it would probably cost another dollar or two (at the most I would hope). I'm sure that in 6 weeks you could take a few trips to a tanning salon and it would make a difference. Other options you could consider are spray tanning, buying some natural looking bronzer, or you could try sunless tanners (I haven't had experience in that, though). I would personally go with the tanning bed because I've seen people attempt to apply sunless tanners and it can look splotchy, messy, and flat out horrible. I hope this helps you, good luck! =)

I hope this helps you.|`|74a71dfd28872bae0d62a67e5cb211b9aa	tuff one.....<br>  <br>  <br>  Murad acne complex is good, you can get it at murad.com or at ulta stores, i think u might be able to get it at sephora too but check online first.<br>  <br>  I have been using murad acne complex for about 9 days now and my all my zits are going down, and are starting to dissappear but i had pretty bad acne!|`|Pss2H6n6aa	Don't pop your zits, wash your face (and back or any other places it's there) three times a day with a face wash (not a bar of soap-- it makes your skin dry which makes the oil in your body come up to the surface), and if you have medicine, put it on day and night. I can't guarantee that will happen -- I mean zits tend to stay there for a while-- but hopefully they will lighten up on your back and other places.|`|RTHW4HCOaa	I had the same problem. For fast results use Neutrogena Face Cleaning Soap (i am not sure what the name is, i think its says acne on the box it is a orange bar of soap in a white box) You can buy it at any CVS. First you should turn on your hot water in your sink all the way (don't worry make it REALLY hot) Take the bar of soap, wet it a little and rub it in your hands till you get subs, then rub your hands on your face scrub all over, be paitent, it's worth it. Then take a towel and drench it with the steaming hot water. Take the towel and wipe off the soap. (it may burn a little, but it feels good). In addition you can boil water on the stove and after boiled put it on your counter with something protective making sure you won't ruin the counter. Put a towel over your head and place your face close to the pot of water. This opens your pores. After this when your pores are open repeat the face washing with hot water and neutrogena soap. If you do this for each day and night leading up to the water park (1week) you should be fine a look great for your boyfriend! GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|ZByJIawzaa	Your best bet is to first see your doctor.

hdR8k6Ilaa	I'd suggest you go to the beautician but if you want to know, I'll tell you.  You part your hair, measure the extension to the part you just made (cut it, the same length as the part), put hair bonding glue on the track, then put it on part you made.  Your really suppose to put it directly on the hair but if you put it on your scalp eventually it'll slide onto your hair (while the bonding glue is wet)  <br>  <br>  In case you didn't know, you can get them sewed in.  It doesn't damage you hair.  It actually helps it grow and get healthier.<br>  <br>  When its time to take the extension out DO NOT pull them out, you have to use bond remover (which is white).  Put the bond remover underneath the glued in track, rub it and let it sit for a while, then shampoo and wash out.  If you read the bottles (the bondage glue and the remover) they should tell you how to use them.|`|7c146878b7674d3bd0629883180c1decaa	unless u want to be bald i recommend you go to a stylist who knows how to do it|`|AA10207751	I suggest you don't do them, as they ruin your hair.

Ahi va:<br>   debes cerrar la boca, y pasar la lengua (con la boca cerrada) de lado a lado, tocando el pómulo por dentro. Este ejercicio tienes que repetirlo 10 minutos por día.

M70Fy2gbaa	You can't.  The only way to remove the split ends is to cut them.  And trust me you want to.  If you do not, the hairs can continue to split up the strand causing breakage.<br>  <br>  Get them cut.<br>  <br>  To prevent them:<br>  <br>  1. Don't brush your hair when it is wet.  Use a wide tooth comb to gently untangle your hair.<br>  <br>  2. Ease up on the heat styling products.  They cause a lot of damage.  If you must use heat use a product designed to help protect your hair from the damage of heat appliances, use the lowest setting possible, when drying don't dry completely let it air dry once it's mostly done, for styling-don't ever ever use a heated styling product on wet/damp hair.<br>  <br>  3. Use a strengthing formula shampoo/conditioner.|`|jGeF3UpVaa	check the links below for natural homemade beauty tips to:-- Dry hair / Oily hair/ Splitends / Fruit Packs for scalp<br>   <a href="http://geebal.blogspot.com/2006/08/natural-homemade-tip-for-oily-dry-hair.html#name1" rel="nofollow">http://geebal.blogspot.com/2006/08/natur...</a>|`|5fTrH0vsaa	Don't comb your hair at all. Don't use blow dryers, cermaic hair stylers or anything else. Let it dry naturally.<br>  Condition your hair with warm olive oil once a week and sleep with it overnight. Wash next morning.<br>  Shampoo using a deep moisturising shampoo and conditioner. <br>  Eat lots of protein.<br>  Once your hair grows around an inch and a half, get it trimmed. You can always ask to get your hair cut only a centimeter, so that the lenght appears more or less the same and you have no split ends.|`|AA10036924	You have to get them cut.  Then have your stylist give you a protein treatment.  It's really stinky but really does make your hair stronger and healthier.|`|AA10973458	Without a haircut... you can't. The hair is actually split, like a peice of wood. Hair is dead cells, something dead cannot grow, just as a split peice of wood cannot grow back together. The only way to get rid of split ends is to trim your hair. To keep them from coming back you have to take care of your hair between trims. First, trim your hair about a centimeter to a half inch every 3-5 weeks. I promise it will grow back faster than you think. Make sure you use hair products sparingly and be sure you NEVER use a hair product with alcohol in it. If you dye, relax or perm your hair, make sure you trim it within a couple of days of getting the chemical treatment. When you get out of the shower and comb your hair, use a pick first and start at the tip of your hair, not the roots and gently comb through as you work your way up. When blowdrying, do not overdry. When using heated styling utensils, use at lowest possible heat setting, and don't keep heat on your hair longer than neccessary. NEVER brush your hair while it is wet. NEVER sleep with it pulled back in any way. Do a hot oil treatment about once a month and a deep conditioning treatment about once a week.|`|DsibfacFaa	you must need a haircut theres no way you can remove split ends by using shampoo or anything else just need a haircut dont worry your hair will be long again if you have short hair its ok too theres no school days right and when your going somewhere just wear headband|`|Wuk0zgp9aa	Use Pantiene Pro-V, it helps heal hair or split ends naturally without drying.|`|jBW6QFLaaa	shave your head!! or wear a wig. the rainbow afros are so in this season.

i2GRGLIpaa	Letting your piercing close up after you get an infection isn't the smartest thing thing to do, it may trap the bacteria and infection in your nose with no way out! Put one of the plastic pieces in the piercing until the infection clears up and then replace the nose ring with a stainless steel piece.<br>  <br>  The next time you get your nose pierced, go to a professional piercing parlor and get it done with a needle. Make sure the place you go is sanitary, and that the piercer wears new rubber gloves and sterilizes EVERYTHING. Stainless steel and 14k gold are the only materials that should be worn in new piercings. NEVER SILVER, which will tarnish and leave a permanent black stain on your nose.<br>  <br>  hope this helped<br>  and good luck!|`|4TfIV33Paa	You shouldn't pierce anything with a piercing gun.  It tears skin and causes infection most of the time.  You should use a needle if your doing it yourself, just make sure the needle is sterile before you use it.  Don't use cheap jewelry either.  It will just make the pierced site worse.  You should just take out the piercing and let it heal for a couple of months and by then it should be healed.  Then you can go and get it redone by a professional. [:|`|gj18ySAWaa	you might have to go to the doctor & get it looked at. but yes you can get it repierced after it heals.

mhyL7Qw3aa	Well if you want to buy drugstore foundation then you can check the website and find a color that looks good with you skin color. Also if you are into high end makeup you can go to any cosmetic counter and they will give you a foundation that matches your skin color. My favorite foundation is by Rimmel London, it's the Stay Matte foundation.|`|uNpyMUXWaa	MAC Will Match U With The Right One But It SOmetimes Break People Out but for a drugstore line it is revlon color stay it is the best good covarge to|`|MWIv6KTjaa	Ok. To find the right shade, you have to test it. You got to match the shade with your neck. You have to look close to your skin color. Colors are different from people to people. Some poeple have red colored tone and others may have yellow tone in their skin. So if you have yellowish color look through the shade with yellow and if you have red look through the shade with red in them. Sometimes people have mixed colors so you have to mix and match the color that is right  for you. Once you have found the right color before you use the shade test it on you neck, when the shade blends in to your neck color spread the foundation on your face using a sponge dont forget to put it on your neck as well. <br>  <br>  i use  Loreal. it works for me.|`|Z4n6Nl7eaa	i test my foundation on my neck, because that's what your face will be contrasting with :)<br>  i think always let it set down a bit, sometimes foundations darken or lighten a few hours after application.<br>  & i use maybaline superstay silky, they have a hugeee range of colours, mine fits perfectly :) x

My tattoos are in memory of my son, so they are very meaningful to me and I know I won't regret them.<br>  <br>  |`|qEuXAv4Zaa	I suppose it depends on a person's motivation for getting tattooed. I didn't get my tattoos to be  trendy,glamorous or cool. I got some because they mark significant changes in my life or because I thought the art work is beautiful. I love that am a living canvas, a walking piece of art! I don't care if the fashion powers that be or anyone else for that matter ever decide that  tattoos aren't "stylish" they are mine, I find them to be beautiful and I will still love them when I am old and wrinkled!|`|A1ZoAWZgaa	That's a good observation, but not necessarily true. People who get tattoos of trends or fashions more often than not DO regret getting inked. Sure, right now your favorite brand is DKNY, but in 10 years it probably won't be. Plus, DKNY isn't going to pay you a cent for self-branding their label on your body. <br>  <br>  However, people who choose to get a well thought out tattoo for more personal reasons (such as a memorial tattoo for their deceased Mom or child) have much less reason to regret their choice.<br>  <br>  People change as time passes. Their friends, family, tastes, hobbies, etc will more than likely be different in a decade; but for some, that tattoo they got a decade ago represents a distinct time in their life, and although they might not choose that same tattoo today, they wouldn't ever want to change that piece of their history.|`|L7TnECbfaa	I have a few tattoos but I REALLY thought about them when I got them. I got them in smart places so when I have children they won't stretch out, and when I am working in a formal setting they won't show.<br>  I realize I could change my mind but all of my tattoos have a meaning and a purpose, so I don't think i will ever regret getting them.|`|AA11815871	People still get perms, they just don't have the tight poodle perm of the 80's.

I'm really proud of the one I got for my sweet 16. It doesn't matter if it's in style or not, who cares? It's always going to be in style to the person who gets it, if they get something meanful to them.|`|ZsKmQOmnaa	Im 18 and have 4 tattoos.  I think people who get tattoos realize they are permanent and thats why they make sure it is something they really want.|`|QXoH01Fiaa	It's a personal choice. Most people that get tattoos know that they want them and plan on keeping them. They are permanent for the most part, but you can get them removed...costly but you can still get them removed. <br>  We pretty much know what we want on our bodies and the after effects it can cause.|`|IbFo0B6Kaa	I'm turning 21, and I have three tattoos now; about one a year since I was 18. Each one is so important to me, I can't possibly see myself regretting them later. They're a part of my body. I'd miss them if they were gone.|`|lwnH4Es3aa	No I can never regret my tats<br>  My first one I got when I was 18 I drew it up at age 8 the night b4 my dad died I dreamed of his death and I even saw the place it happend in the dream and knew what he hit and everything before it actually happend this was the 1st time I ever had this preminition kinda thing happen, but after that dream/night mare I dream of me drawing this picture of stars like a firework only it was stars and I drew it over and over again I drew it multiply times in all my note books and folders and when ever I doodled that was what I would draw first! My second tat was of a blue moon and a small yellow star on my left wrist in honor of freinds that are no long here in the US, the moon was for one of them because her fav color was blue and the star was yellow becasue the other one always picked on me and said I had yellow skin cuz I dont tan. The moon is kinda around the star to show that my one freind protected the other because they were siblings. My third is on my right wrist it is a sun symbolising me because I am seperated from my freinds it is red and yellow the center yellow because of the same reason as the yellow star and red because it is like blood(pain). My fourth one is of a flying pegasus I choose this a year before i got it-and I chose this because I wanted wings- to symbolize I have flown free from my past all the bad garbage I have been through I am dealing with and doing much better I have flown free and Im not gonna explain the bad garbage because it is to much and to bad to discuse.And to Lexi X I designed all of my tattoos and they all have meaning to them so unless you have a tat and regret it you have no right to tell us it is stupid!!!!!!|`|XxU94aKlaa	I personally would love to see a law saying that no tattoos could be done on anyone until 18 years of age, this coming from an individual who got her first tattoo with parental permission at the age of 16. I think the majority of younger individuals simply do not think beyond the "cool" aspect of getting a tattoo and will often come to regret the tattoo of their choosing a few years down the road.<br>  Even beyond the age aspect- I see far too many people come on here asking what they should get, where they should get it, and god knows how many other questions that simply push the fact that they are simply not yet ready to get a tattoo. People don't seem to think before acting.<br>  The majority of people do not seem to think about the consequences or permeate nature of tattoos these days, and it really causes issues to those of us who do put time and thought into the art we have done.<br>  I got a wolf placed on the center of my back at the age of 16. It started with an obsession with wolves that I had since 2nd grade, and continued with a quote reminding me why I wanted to be like one of the animals I so admired:<br>  "A healthy woman is much like a wolf: Both social creatures, longing for pack mates, intelligent, communicative, wild, gentle, playful, capable of great strength, fiercely loyal, territorial, and beautiful."<br>  I got a wolf tattooed on the center of my back to hold me together and to remind me of the person I want to be. The tattoo was in my head for about 3 years, and years after getting it I still don't regret it.<br>  Why is that? Because I thought about my own design, had personal meaning behind my tattoo, and because I took time before commiting to it. God help me if I ever regret it- I'll never remove it even if I do. <br>  The majority of individuals sadly do not seem to look at it this way- I see people saying they can always get laser removal, and I see flash art all over. It's very sad to see such a great art form is being pulled down these days.|`|uTKCjmKgaa	lol why did you say "even women" as though women with tattoos are weird.<br>  <br>  i wont regret it, im 19 and am about to get my fourth tattoo, each of my tattoos signify a major life change for me or something truely important (such as my family), they each have meaning behind them and i have tirelessly researched each and every one.<br>  <br>  i know i wont regret them, ive wanted tattoos since i was 6 years old, and none of them are "trendy" tattoos, they all have symbolic meaning to me, and to the people who know me. and if i havent changed my mind about tattoos in 13 years, i doubt i will in the next 13 years.|`|ZfeSyoKXaa	I got things tattooed on me that i know i'm going to still love at 80...Some people get them to get them and if they end up not liking it anymore,so what?

jodGSRxYaa	if you're talking about acne then I would suggest going to skinID.com<br>  <br>  they have a whole big survey you go throw to help you find out which products are right for you. they ask questions about your skin and your lifestyle.  it's really well set-up and very accurate.<br>  <br>  if you're just looking to have clear skin just wash it twice a day.  once in the morning once at night.  wet your face before washing it and try to use really warm water, but not burning hot.  when your done washing, rinse with the same temperature water but once you've gotten all the soap of, use some cold water to snap your pores shut.  this will help block out bacteria and keep your skin tighter and firmer.  it makes it look better in the long run.  if you find that regular soap irritates your skin, like makes it very dry, or red and itchy, then try face washing from the store, and try to look for something that says for "sensitive skin".  if you do get dry skin always stay away from products that have salyic acid or benziode peroxide.  these will only make your skin worse.  and they'll burn.<br>  <br>  also find a really good moisterizer.  best thing for your skin, try to find something with sun block in it, spf 15 should be good for an everyday sorta thing.<br>  <br>  and if you really want to go over board, get some face pads that you can apply during the day, if you play sports they're really useful.  when your done sweating you wipe your face with it and it removes a lot of the dirt and crap from your face which is really gonna help it look cleaner.  when looking for these i know olay makes ones that are like specifically for perposes like that, not like an acne medication sorta thing.|`|KwheCx4Aaa	Honestly, sometimes I'll go a day without washing my face at all (if I don't wash maybe I'll use toner with a cotton round).  <br>  Most of the time I only wash my face once (in the morning). <br>  The trick is don't put so many different products on your skin. I know they call them "cleansers" but I do just fine with plain ol' bar soap. |`|APftKj7Saa	Lol...umm<br>  Dont wash your face too much because you will end up with very dry skin!

Like, Neutrogena is a good brand. but make sure you moisturize your face with creams or lotions after you wash it. Also I've heard that after taking a hot shower, your pores are open so all the dirt is out of them, so you then just rinse off in cold water to close your pores up so no dirt gets in. Always moisturize before bed and before you go outside.

AA12339383	This really can be frustrating, but don't give up!<br>  There are many solutions for oily skin. First, ALWAYS wash your face before beginning your makeup routine. This will eliminate oil while you apply your makeup, and keep pores unclogged throughout the day. Make sure the soap you are using is oil free. I personally recommend Clinique soaps - they don't dry you out completely, which can lead to breakouts, but they cleanse and soften skin very nicely.<br>  Second, if your skin does feel dry after washing, use a light moisturizer in the "tight", dry spots (if there are any). I like Cetaphil lotion, available at Wal*Mart. It's very light, and doesn't liquify in your skin. <br>  Foundation for oily skin should be chosen wisely, and ALWAYS make sure your foundation is oil free. You need a quality product that is actually worth your while. If you want to spend $10 to $15, Wal*Mart carries Maybelline Pure Makeup, which works wonderfully. If you are willing to spend a little more, like $30 or so, go see the Clinique counter in a mall near you, and let them evaluate your face. Tell them all the problems you have with your skin, and they will find a foundation that should work for you. (Trust me, they will try to sell you more things, but don't feel like you have to purchase them!) <br>  You only want a dime-sized amount of foundation for your entire face, (especially with oily skin!) and apply with a sponge. Don't wipe it accross your face, but go area by area, starting with your forehead (where you may need the most foundation), then cheeks, then nose, then chin (which needs the least foundation), by gently pushing it into your skin. <br>  Then always apply a light dusting of translucent powder (Cover Girl compacts are great!) with a blush brush - the smaller size helps you apply in harder to reach areas, like the crease of your nose and cheek. <br>  Throughout the day, your face will emit oil, as all skin does, but in your situation, it sounds like it is more than most people. I recommend using oil-blot papers, also available at drug stores or Wal*Mart. Applying more powder will often look too cakey, especially when your skin is oily - it forms a thick residue on your skin that can clog your pores.<br>  If these methods don't solve your problem to your desired effect, make an appointment with a trusted dermatolagist and see if he/she can prescribe a facewash or moisturizer that will cut down on the oil-production of your skin.<br>  I hope this is of help, and sorry so long-winded!|`|4V52qZqwaa	have you tried Neutrogenia products they are amazing,  the other thing is Natural Minerals products.
QDp7HM2paa	Personally I think short term - Anorexia is worse (can do some long term damage) but long term, I think throwing up is worse. It affects internal organs, can cause stomach acid to damage the throat and worst of all, can burn away the stomach lining.<br>  Some more:<br>  Weight gain <br>  Abdominal pain, bloating <br>  Swelling of the hands and feet <br>  Chronic sore throat, hoarseness <br>  Broken blood vessels in the eyes <br>  Swollen cheeks and salivary glands <br>   Weakness and dizziness <br>  Tooth decay and mouth sores <br>  Acid reflux or ulcers <br>  Ruptured stomach or esophagus <br>  Loss of menstrual periods <br>  Chronic constipation from laxative abuse  <br>  <br>  Both are awful.|`|QBiVJG1xaa	the problem with throwing up, aka bulimia, is that it ruins your teeth and your throat and your stomach and causes problems and can hurt your heart...I know that starving, aka anorexia, has it's issues too, but they seem not so obvious.  It's really easy to get caught throwing up.  Besides, it's extremely addictive.  I do not let myself purge for the fear that I will never want to stop.<br>  <br>  Now, not eating at all can't mean AT ALL, unless you mean for a certain amount of time, or a fast, you obviously can't mean indefinitely.  Then you'd die.  I find that severe restriction is the best.  Fasting for too long can lead to binging.  it also causes weight gain coming off.  the best thing to do is to restrict a lot, varying the amount or calories, and then throw in a fast day now and then.  |`|zs7zI9xSaa	being bulimic is worse, not saying that anorexic is good either but deffently bulimic because you are throwing up ur food and everytime u throw up ur not only throwing up what u ate ur throwing up acid witch can hurt ur through if u do it enough u could get cuts in the back or ur throat and it will burn when u eat and drink certain things such as orange juice|`|izi0tPCgaa	I find that anorexia is worse. <br>  And, yeah, that's different though. An anorexic who doesn't eat PLUS she throws up is completely different then bulimia. And, that's worse than anything. <br>  |`|aJIXWKBUaa	Eating and then throwing up means that you will get at least a bit of the nutrients from your food, so that is better than starving, however regular vomiting causes issues with stomach acid eating away at the enamel on your teeth.|`|rCWgX9M2aa	Not eating at all would be better because the acid from your stomach will damage the lining of your throat eventually. Promise me you won't do either.|`|0HqwrW8Uaa	If you really want an answer for<br>  that,throwing up what you eat is<br>  worse! =\|`|xYsCC5UXaa	a bulimic person couldn't be anorexic.<br>  anorexia is when you don't eat. period.<br>  bulimia is when you eat a little, then puke afterwards.<br>  <br>  neither.<br>  anorexia will make you lose weight too fast, and it will deteriate your heart muscle quite quickly.<br>  bulimia will burn your throat and will also tear your stomach.<br>  <br>  have fun with those.|`|euZRbiA2aa	surely you will die very quickly if you dont eat nothing at all,so i would imagine that would be least healthy.|`|n11TSqkbaa	Even people with anorexia eat  once in awhile. People with bulimia will usually have funky teeth from stomach acid from throwing up. Their esophagus will also suffer major damage, as well as their tongue and throat. They get a few more nutrients because food is in their stomach for a little bit. People with anorexia will usually die of organ failure and starvation first, so I guess being bulimic is better because you would live longer.....|`|462b78f4311608808a5064e9afb784d7aa	I actually believe that they're equally unhealthy - the problem with both is that you don't get the nutrients that you need either way.

It has infused tourmoline which sets 400% more negitive ions than any other straightener which makes for better shine and is less damaging to the hair.

Pjw1d5DEaa	Definately ear lobe. If it's your first piercing, you should start simple. Yeah, that's what everybody else said, and I agree. You might find out that you're allergic to certain types of metal, and I can gaurantee it's going to hurt a helluva lot more if the piercing is on the lip. That's what happened to my friend who got a lip piercing. She had fish lips for a week. I know that when I got my first piercing (ears) I would have been way too scared to get a lip piercing. Now I have two ear piercings and I'd still be too scared to get a lip piercing, but I don't want to anyway. I mean, how do you eat?

xunzkeofaa	Use a pumice stone to buff off as much calloused skin as possible. Use on heels and on the edges of the feet and toes. Do this procedure for one week, preferably just before bedtime. <br>  <br>  Soak feet in warm, soapy water for at least 15 minutes after using the pumice stone. If your feet are sore and extremely cracked, get a product called Domboro Solution and use it according to directions for the foot soak. While soaking, gently use the pumice stone again and do more scraping of thick skin and calluses. <br>  <br>  Dry the feet thoroughly and wait ten minutes so the cracks are completely dry. Use a hair dryer to make sure the cracked areas are dry. If moisture remains hidden in the cracks, it can cause infection.<br>  <br>  Apply a cream called Lansinoh after feet are totally dry. This is 100 percent pure, modified lanolin. <br>  <br>  Put on clean white socks and keep them on all night. In the morning, remove the socks and reapply more Lansinoh cream. Put on a clean pair of white socks. <br>  <br>  Repeat steps daily for an entire week. If your feet are terribly cracked and very painful, do this treatment twice daily to speed the healing process. <br>  <br>  Discontinue the soaks when your feet have healed, and are soft and smooth. Apply a good lotion every night to keep the condition from reoccurring. <br>  <br>  =)|`|kD7TMG1Xaa	i would start by soaking my feet in some warm soapy water, moisturising soap would be best, after it is important to rub with a pommystone or another only slightly rough surface to remove all the dead dry skin.<br>  if you want something really natural mix cottage cheeses with avocado to rub on but otherise stick to ordinary moisturisers i find body shop ones great and they small fantastic too but you can get a slimple cheap one in a shop also.<br>  alternatively whilst your feet are still wet use baby oil rub in as much as you can and then sit with your feet proped up so they can dry without using a towel.<br>  you will need to do this regularly before your skin returns to normal and then maintain your skin by regularly moisurising<br>  remember it works so much better to moisturise just washed feet as it maintains so much more moisture|`|794a8a79f04dc777f4635ecb815b7f37aa	The way I prevent dry feet is I get a good moisturizer and I rub it over my foot liberally, and then I put a sock over it.

Putting vinegar (about 1/2 cup) in the bath water will clean your skin and your feet. Scrape the dead skin from your feet with your fingernails. Get a jar of cocoa butter from Sally's Beauty Supplies, slather all over you feet, rub in, take your time, put it on your skin anywhere (good for wrinkles, dry skin) and does not damage your clothes. Sleep with socks on and let it soak in. You can also slather and then dip in hot wax spa treatment--just like hands. Then re-slather and do the socks.
IxRNqSQnaa	There are many causes of dark circles, from age, heredity, allergies, cold or sinus infection, bone structure and glasses which are not so commonly known. <br>  <a href="http://www.mydarkcirclesblog.com/2006/11/27/causes-of-dark-circles/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mydarkcirclesblog.com/2006/11...</a><br>   <br>   <br>  If you would like to apply home remedies to reduce dark circles, here are some of my suggestions:<br>  Buy a box of regular, old fashioned unflavored gelatin (e.g. Knox) from grocery store. Take a small cup or bowl and put in 1 teaspoon of the gelatin mix. Add one tablespoon of boiling water & stir for a minute. Test it on your wrist to make sure it is not too hot. Then, using a cotton ball, pat it under your eyes as you would an eye cream or gel. Go lie down and listen to some music, or take a bath & let it stay on for at least 30 minutes. Then just rinse it off.Gelatin is very high in Vitamin K & Biotin. It will not remove your dark circles on the first application (but you will notice a difference), but if you do it daily for a week, and then 2-3 times a week for maintenance, you should notice a drastic reduction in dark circles.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mydarkcirclesblog.com/2007/01/01/special-spa-home-remedy-to-reduce-dark-circles/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mydarkcirclesblog.com/2007/01...</a><br>  <br>    <br>  <br>  To hide dark circles, you can use YSL concealer or salmon concealer..<br>  <a href="http://www.mydarkcirclesblog.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mydarkcirclesblog.com</a> tips on how to reduce dark circles, the causes of dark circles, home remedies, eye creams reviews, make  up tips, and natural healer.<br>   <br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.cleansecolonblog.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cleansecolonblog.com</a> Cleanse Colon Blog writes about colon cleanse home remedies and review colon cleanse products.|`|9e28e1bd1e22ed004860a5262bf7471caa	use lemon and honey both mixed and apply under eye....|`|iFowpJTBaa	i have that too. i thought it was a sleep problem but it was milk shiners<br>  <br>  <br>  try avoiding dairy products and see if it makes a difference. or try under eye cream...<br>  <br>  <br>  it could also be vitamin defficiecy. get your iron!|`|v7q092Q5aa	omg! 2 words - Mary Kay! they are the best in the world! they have a new eye product called eye revitalizer which should definately help. they also have other products like soothing eye gel and firming eye cream. there's also the facial highlighting pen which totally helps lighten up dark spots. the best thing is its cheaper than department store brands but just as or even higher quality. just go to the mk web site and click the "find a consultant near you" link. it really works! i would also suggest checking out other mk procucts! it's the only skin care and make up that i'll use!

gW8VFRmjaa	quality products helps aloooott. i have loads of polishes ranging from dollar store ones (billie) to MAC & OPI. and the dollar store ones...ive gotta put on at least like 5 coats and they chip off within a day or two. my OPI ones especially (but MAC too) don't chip as easily. <br>  start with a good base. so clean your nails, clean up ur cuticles, buff them etc. then use a good base coat. i use OPI's base & top coat. the top coat helps alot too. and don't shape your nails into extreme squares...leave the corners rounded or do your entire nail rounded. (i like the rounded edge squares). don't overapply your polish either. <br>  also i find drying them properly helps alot. i use a dry oil (it's amazing, instantly dries your polish!) and i also have the drying spray. i think the thing that makes the biggest diff is the base tho...start with clean buffed nails!<br>  <br>  good luck, hope i helped!|`|wbgpp5kYaa	well the key is to have a healthy nail and good nail polish. make sure you smooth out you nail and if your nails peel even them out. then make sure the nail polish you use is new. and the kind you get with the beauty kit or where they are like <a href="http://i29.tinypic.com/4t3q1i.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i29.tinypic.com/4t3q1i.jpg</a> <br>  that aren't good and they will chip no matter what and peel. i use nyc and love my nails all the time and it works great. so that should help a lot!and if it doesn't then add a top coat after all this is done.|`|K9kN68fwaa	I used to always struggle with this same problem.<br>  The best way to give yourself a home manicure is,<br>  <br>  1st Prepare the nail bed and smooth the area.<br>  2nd Apply a base coat<br>  3rd Apply the nail polish, I love OPI and Revlon<br>  4th Apply a top coat<br>  <br>  I don't think you can put acrylic over the polish.

uTKCjmKgaa	i mean apart from the obvious of getting a phoenix as they are symbols of rebirth (so forgetting and moving on from your past)<br>  <br>  there are other symbols, traditionally, patience goes hand in hand with symbols of love, so hearts etc. but also in ancient english history lambs were a symbol of gentleness and patience under suffering.<br>  <br>  and camels. (not my fave of animals i must admit) are also a symbol of patience and perserverance.<br>  <br>  thats all i can really think of off the top of my head... i'll let you know more if i think of them.|`|84a92b794a6ae292684ad41ae82b80b4aa	A tat about your past will be with you <br>  till you die.

nBGqqaMFaa	Try some black eyeliner, but get a skinny one and don't smudge it (because when you do, it usually tends to make the person get raccoon eyes).<br>  Eyeshadow also really makes eyes pop.|`|K9kN68fwaa	Easy try putting a black pencil liner on first with liquid eyeliner on top of that and use loreal Voluminous Mascara...

f8830aba1d653c00aa5f2a6bfb90aadbaa	Actually, dirty hair is only good for styling it. <br>  At professional salons, they wash your hair and then dye it, and that's what I suggest to you. :) <br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope your color comes out great!|`|uIp7y7ymaa	wash ur hair, then dye it the next day.

AA11398474	If you could buy a suit (affordable) that would be best - as most other people will likely be wearing a suit.  Not sure which country you are from but you can probably get a suit from ￡50 upwards.  Some suggestions in the links below.<br>  <br>  You can get some good deals - jackets with free ttrousers thrown in for the price.<br>  <br>  Alternatively if you can't get a suit, then you need a good pair of Semi -Casual trousers (no jeans / no pockets down the legs) and a decent shirt with a tie.  You can probably get an affordable shirt, tie and smart trousers in Tesco or Asda.  If you cant get this you could probably wear a pair of cords (but you need to have a smart pair of shoes).<br>  <br>  Some key things:<br>  <br>  Don't wear white trousers!  But a white shirt is ok.<br>  Don't wear jeans or shorts!<br>  Don't wear anything too sporty or wear trainers! <br>  Make sure your shoes are polished and clean.<br>  <br>  If you can afford it - get a suit - you will use it again - unless you suddently grow ten foot! <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|YG82GgRwaa	<a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=235907&CategoryID=35254&LinkType=SiteAd&LinkLoc=5449&AdID=49846" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a>|`|008d024d3871560cd8c65bfd66ae3f8daa	You don't have a suit than it's an emergency dude.

8cjFSBW9aa	I am not sure where you live but see if there is a modeling agency near you or in your city. Then give them a call and ask them if they will be having any open calls soon and if not, could you please drop off some photos---a portfolio preferably--and ask if they are interested in looking at any new models. The agency should be able to give you the info you need and what they are looking for at that time. An "open call" is sort of like an open audition for anyone who is interested. It is usually very crowded and quick for those that the agency are not interested in. Since they see a lot of girls, you have to have thick skin because they may look at you and  and say  "no" and that's it. They may say that you are too short or you need to lose weight, whatever. Don't take it personally. It's a business. If they say "yes" and you get in to see the agent, great pictures can make all the difference so if you know of a good photographer, have some head shots done in black and white and then some full length shots done, some in color.  Don't wear a lot of make-up and wear a nice dress but don't get all dressed up. They want to see what You look like--not your make up or clothes. Practice a walk. And don't jump in with talking. If you get in to see the agent, she or he, will look at your photos and then you and tell you what they need you to do. First of all, make sure it is a legitimate agency and not something that is a fly by night thing. Also, there are adds in the paper all of time that will say they are looking for models and actresses, etc and then when you get there, they will tell you that you have potential but will need to go to their school, which is expensive. THIS IS NOT A LEGITIMATE AGENCY. This is a "modeling-talent" school looking for people who will pay anything for their dream. A legitimate agent will not ask you to pay them. They may ask you to have more photos done and recommend a photographer who they have used before and knows what that agent is looking for. And the photographer will need to be paid. All of this will need to be done to build your portfolio because this is what clients will look at when you go on go-sees {sort of auditions}.<br>  What I am telling you is that if you really want to do it, then be prepared to work for it. If you are accepted by a good agent, they will find the work for you and you make them money. But be prepared to hear " NO" a lot. You will need to be able to handle rejection and not let it devastate you. You just go to the next one. Clients always  are looking for a certain type at a certain time. And not all of the jobs you go on are glamorous. I had to work at the NASCAR Winner's Club during races for not that much money but it was work.<br>  I started out at age 12 for Sears  and worked catalog and shows while going to school through highschool. In college, I would fly to Chicago during the weekends for work. After college, I got my BSN and became an RN because that was what I wanted to do ,but I did get an agent and worked when I could for them doing anything from Hanes Leggs ads to being a ring-girl for a boxing match for Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. It made me some extra money and it was fun. I stopped at age 38yrs because I was getting too old and I moved to CA where all of the women look beautiful and I was out of my league. I always knew that I would never be a super model so make sure that you keep things in perspective.<br>  If this is something you really want to try, you'll need your parent's consent until you are 18yrs old. If they do not consent then you will have to wait until you are of age. If this is truly your dream, then waiting shouldn't diminish your desire. While waiting, you can collect photos of yourself. Ask your friends to take pictures of you at different locations and different functions. Collect your pictures in a book and then you can take the best ones when you finally get an agent. You can make your dreams come true if you really want them. Just be patient and keep trying.|`|j5lFhub6aa	sure|`|S4QZDh2qaa	yes :) i love modeling. nothing professional though, ha. just little photoshoots <3|`|AA11499575	Your figure is fine but you will most likely not be able to do high fashion modeling (eg. for designers) because their height expectations are minimum of 5'8''. However, there are many other avenues in modeling like print or commercial. On the other hand too, Kate Moss was a very successful high fashion model and she was only 5'7''. Your best bet is to send your headshot and full body shot to REPUTABLE modeling agencies like Ford, Ellite or Wilhelmina and await for their response. NEVER pay a dime to anyone that promises you a career in modeling! A reputable agency will never ask you for any money...not even for professional pictures. Good luck!
hVnep8a9aa	i'm 13<br>  my hair is pretty curly so i either play it up and scrunch it into loose curls, or i blow dry and straighten it.<br>  for make-up, i am VERY natural. i just put on a bit of concealer if i need and some powder. a tad of mascara and mayb some eyeshadow if i want. then some lip gloss and thats it!|`|0f840404a3e61c42fc32d4b027a6565faa	well really your not doin anything wrong. your style is your style and seems like you work it. i personaly wear a little nuetregena face make-up and maybeline mascara. and thats it. and i'm confident with that. all you have to do it be confident.|`|SIMCOKwnaa	When i wake up, i already have my clothes out(Kinda organized...)<br>  Then for make up, i wash my face with the Morning Burst stuff by clean and clear. Then i use a light powder that doesnt clog my pores. (I have REALLY oily skin) so i use the oil pads that dont rub off make up.<br>  As for my eyes, I usually only use eyeliner on the top and bottom. (Black)<br>  <br>  then for hair, since mine is curly, i straighten it and go through it with a barrel brush to get some volume in it. it gives it slight waves too. and i have bangs so i move them to the side with a barette.<br>  <br>  it all takes me about 30-35 mins too! (I have mastered the art of speed)|`|0e906f7dcb63f2aa18ed959055f6eb84aa	Since I have curly hair, I wash it at night and either blow dry it straight (with some dream hair straightening balm) or wait until the morning and straighten it anyways (my hair is very unruly). In the morning, I wear a little bit of Almay foundation, and less than a dab of quo concealer whereever i need it. then i follow with eyeliner, a little black mascara  and to make my eyes a little less dark i put on a little bit of gold/beige eyeshadow that compliments my beige/tanned skin. I try to make it look fresh and natural as possible. I usually don't use lipgloss, or I put it on and never re apply if it comes off. Sometimes I use body spray or a little perfume, but thats it! : ) It sounds like a lot, but I use only a little bit of everything lol. I don't think your doing anything wrong!:)|`|7kga2aRBaa	um well i shower, and scrub my face clean.  i blow dry my hair straight like you, and sometimes i straighten it aswell if it gets frizzy.  then i put on powder foundation, sometimes bronzer, eyeliner-bottom and top, mascara, and a natural colored lipgloss.  I don't wear eyeshadow thaat much, but i do like to experiment with it alot, light shimmers that make my eyes look bigger, blending blue's and whites to highlight my blue eyes, etc..  I even have a light blue metallic eyeliner, that looks awsome, its a really nice look for the beach, highlights my eyes, and its waterproof so i can go in the water :)<br>  <br>  your not doing anything wrong, you probably look very natural and pretty:)|`|pZVSudTEaa	when i wake up, i wash my face with St. Ives apricot scrub (love it!) then i pat it dry..but not all the way. its good to leave your face a little damp. then after i brush my teeth, i go to my room and rub my Clinque face moisturizer on..its great. when im done, i part my hair and straighten the parts that look weird (my hair is really straight alone)...then i put some Mayballine foundation/concealer on for pimples/red spots...i put eyeliner on my bottom lid then mascara on top. then i add some lip gloss..thats about it.<br>  -i shower in the night so its faster|`|uJJPFJoyaa	Well I'm 19, I don't wear any make up at all because I don't need it. The only thing i wear is lip gloss and vaseline balm to mosturize lips. Its been 3 years since  i stopped wearing make up since several people back then told me my appearance looked so much nautral & younger without make up, after a while your skin tones up making it look like you are wearing some make up but really aren't. Besides after watching my 14 year old sister cake on make up & waste so much money on these expensive brands she now has lots of acne becuase of it. I don't like my pores to suffocate & clog...so I stick with natural beauty.|`|681f77a965e84814f7531e72d5aacd86aa	well im going to start wearing make up just some Eyeshadow, Mascara and Lipgloss and that's all too much an you'll look like a clown|`|68bmiPGbaa	im thirteen and i wear makeup.  after i shower in the morning ii keep my hair that was because it looks wavy and awesome. =]  the makeup i wear would be come foundation some light mascara and some light eye shadow.  and you sound just right to me =]|`|7jixgZ0jaa	I just let my hair air dry. Blowdrying damages your hair.  i wear mascara and light eye shadow and a little lip gloss.|`|Jm16KvIxaa	i just through on some clear mascara most of the time. black mascara and a little eyeshadow if i have the time/will.<br>  <br>  for my hair, i put on some leave on conditioner and shine serum.<br>  <br>  i think yours is fine. i do the same thing with my hair (blowdry it straight), well either that or i just shower at night and let air dry.|`|NzU8q8XMaa	First I put bronzer on my whole face, then I put mascara and eyeliner on the bottom for the eyeliner. I put brown eyeshadow on for my blue eyes, if you have brown eyes put on blue. Then I put on blush. Finally, I put a little bit of loose powder on my face.|`|aeHXiE1Kaa	Before going out, it takes me a long time. This is my schedule:<br>  <br>  I brush my hair back in a ponytail. I put on my flat iron and wash my face with three of my acne washes (one a pad one something you don't wash off). Then I touch parts of my face when I know that it's dry and then I put on a powder to get rid of some of the red parts. Then I use natural colors or colors that match my skin tone or hair OR something that matches my outfit. Then I take my hair out, use the flat iron in three layers of my hair.<br>  <br>  You sound fine|`|e3023972570bb415f2c1ec89bb3ac3e1aa	I put product in my hair so it doesn't frizz up and air dry my wavy curly hair and then I straighten my bangs so they look good. then I put bare minerals powder all over and conceal spots and dark circles under my eyes. then I put the mineral vail to absorb shine and oil... then I put a bit of mascara and sometimes black or brown pencil on the bottom lashes and some mascara... then I put lip balm to moisturize my lips and then some cute lipgloss.. then a few spritzes of perfume and I'm good to go! I'm 13 BTW|`|S8lUubbGaa	I straighten my hair, put it up in a quiff or chignon. My eyes are my best feature, so I play them up with lots of mascara and eyeliner (natural looking though because I have dark eyes). Then I put a peachy blush on to make me look glowing and some vaseline on my lips. Maybe some concealer under eyes if it's been a late night.|`|vJ47D9kfaa	It depends, when I'm going to college I'll just wear black eyeliner (on the bottom), bronze/beige shimmer eyeshadow, curl lashes & apply mascara. Then I'll use clear lipgloss. But on weekends or when I'm going out I'll wear:<br>  Maybe foundation<br>  Gold & Bronze eyeshadow<br>  Black Eyeshadow on the bottom, outer angles of my eyes (to add smokiness)<br>  Black Eyeliner<br>  Cur lashes & mascara<br>  Sun-kissed bronzer on cheeks<br>  And peach-colored lipgloss<br>  !<br>  <br>  Your make up sounds nice & natural. I don't usually like to overdo it but I do like to look nice so I make an effort with my make up! Also I think that Make up can really lift a person's features and improve their look immensely.<br>  Also every skin tone and different people's features suit different types and colors of make up. The make up I wear suits my olive skin and black, long hair. Also it brings out my green eyes.

oDzOYMjDaa	No. Just think about how terrible they'll look when little stubs of hair start growing back (in the same position!)... You need to train them to lay flat.|`|NFZH7zd6aa	no! they will grow back the same way!|`|rUKCmoJDaa	no i dont think u should take those babies out....<br>  i have those too and they make me look prettier with them on then without them as i've shaved them before.....it looked like i was bald lol|`|n2uNU4zdaa	No way! It will leave an empty space there showing your cowlick line even more! I have them too-they suck!
K23WjvvPaa	I prefer HAI...But whatever you are using is probably quality which is extremely important because it will damage your hair less in the long run, so I'm sure it was a good buy!|`|71QvTzUFaa	well i have a 50$ straight-ner and it works very well|`|847b1c397a23cd43b78aa30275750097aa	I've never heard of HA hair straighteners, I've just bought some GHD ones and they are fab..i love them!|`|BMyBN43Aaa	GHD I think there the best but dependd on how bad your hair is|`|922d47b2f4cef80931090217f00652d6aa	any ceramic ones are good, I still use my old GHD and they are great|`|c3738431867dc5c9edf50583885ff001aa	GHD straighteners are cheaper than that i guess and they are really good, hairdressers use them. I personally havn't got them but i got ones which go up to 240 degrees and they are great and i paid 84.99 for them.
fd70fccb8e7a8b263ea448099c984a1daa	usually not too wet, towel dry your hair first. damp hair. just read the instructions on the back.|`|AA10556952	Damp hair|`|FF8IpLGraa	Read the back of your product. If there is no info there, I suggest applying when hair is dry. That way when you finish blow dry, curling or anything else you can add the shine and get those stray hairs when your ready to walk out the door.|`|P5Iv6gmlaa	best to use it when it's damp. So... when your hair dries, itll be good and unfrizzy! lol.<br>   thats what i do and my friends have long since dropped the name Miss Frizzy.
st5tS50Faa	You should NEVER EVER cut your cuticles. Your cuticles protect you from fungus, germs, etc. Cutting them will open you up to all kinds of possible infections. Buy a cuticle cream  and rub that into your cuticles to keep them smooth and beautiful.|`|T5xnjA03aa	Push back your cuticles and cut off any loose ones carefully with nail clippers. <br>  My mom showed me that trick and my nails have looked great ever since.

I have very long, very thick hair and if I'm in a hurry, I just brush my hair and slip on a thick hair band. There are some cute retro looking ones and leather ones and ones that look like scarves. I think I have hairbands in every color and width. Also, put your hair in a low ponytail and slick back the rest of your hair with a good gel. Or put the top half of your hair in a pony tail and let the little loose hairs go. It softens the look and keeps the style from looking too controlled.|`|vkWX6Hgtaa	check out some magazines. i like seventeen and cosmo girl. they tell u what products to use and its affordable. u don't have to buy them. just go into a store and write it down or take mental notes.
95357efc3ba8d7fb66c1e91e89a10e05aa	Yes, its fantastic...You will love it.!|`|523ef0fae6b39bfc436fe3f0a0e61d80aa	Yeah, my sister is using it. She loves it. It works to a certain degree.

eFSQ1F0Raa	i have nevr heard of sedu.... but i know chi is usually about 100+ i have never used one but many people swear by them... personally i use vidal sasson (about 30-40 bucks) and i have never had a problem with it and my hair gets srtaighter than that pic you showed..... just make sure any one you get that you only use the heat you need... dont use too high of heat for your hair cuz it will speed up the damage to your hair and use a heat protector spray or hair serum when straightening your hair|`|uIp7y7ymaa	revlon ones are very good and cheap ones are crap. if you want a good one go to a proffesional beauty place not a salon but where they sell their products to the salons. they have the best straightners|`|EXK9PRzTaa	Take a quick look at my picture.<br>  <br>  Andis Ceramic is the way to go. Real cheap at walmart.<br>  <br>  <br>  It's almost like a gift from god, really. <br>  <br>  I was born with curly hair.|`|ef71c2149f4ed1966d1355eb26fba87eaa	Chi is a very good name brand. I've never heard of Sedu. Many hair stylists have told me Chi and Paul Mitchell are the best buys. But remember that any heat on your hair damages it so you'll need to get a trim every three months or more, depending on how often you use it. I bought my Chi for $100 at www.folica.com. Their prices are extremely reasonable. ALOT cheaper than purchasing a straightner from a salon. When I bought mine, they gave free shipping and a heat protectant mat, which I thought was a nice gift. Salons most often use a Chi without versitile heat settings. I dont know why, but I chose one that allows me to adjust heat. That way, if you have thin hair, you can use a low heat setting for less damage. For thick, course hair, you use a higher heat setting. Chi makes a product called "iron guard" which is a solution that you spritz you hair with before straightening. This adds a bit of protection, pay special attention to your ends. Heat splits them.|`|kRJ0w09yaa	the chi is cheaper and it works
APA1oo4naa	well, first let me say that all professionals use special lighting & makeup when they need to be on stage/performing/taking studio still pics/videos/talk show appearances, etc.  celebrity photos and videos can also be digitally enhanced to remove any skin imperfections.  they usually have hair stylists & makeup artists on call or around at all times.  so to think they're perfect is not being realistic.  most in the entertainment business have to work at it and have some sort of beauty regimen along with a healthy diet and exercise plan to keep their skin looking clear and radiant.  don't forget to keep well hydrated and drinks plenty of water daily.   <br>  <br>  you can find reputable and reasonably priced products at your local drug store/pharmacy that you can use once or twice daily.  you may want to try and include one or more of several products to add a cleanser/exfoliant, toner, acne medication, moisturizer, protective sunscreen daily for improving, achieving and maintaining a clear complexion.  ask someone who works there for assistance.|`|ymmPnFPNaa	ah...i love super junior...well, im not asian, im white, but if you use a facewash that takes away dead skin....makes your skin softer, and moisture as well, it will make your face look brighter because you have new skin all the time!|`|IJgif2Czaa	that's too fuccin white dude...damn near albino|`|lRJPcNxyaa	I would recommend the Anew Luminosity cream because it's also has SPF 15 which protects your face from UVA & UVB rays that can cause cancer. Anyhow, the luminosity cream helps to give you a brighter complexion and evens out the skin tone. I use it every morning after I wash my face and have noticed a brighter glow to my face.
9mGGjYaTaa	Use Pureology Hydrate Shampoo and Conditioner, then follow it up with Pureology Instant Repair Leave-In Conditioner. Its light so not to weigh down the finest hair yet is very moisturizing.|`|nd6yXe75aa	biosilk , u can get it a hair salons, ask for the serum. :)|`|APA1oo4naa	i think the best way to condition chemically lightened hair is to go to a salon and get a heat conditioning treatment.  they have a variety of high quality conditioners that they can use and that combined with the heat application will really make a difference.  the amount you'll pay for them to apply it and the results are worth it.
W9l1Y6pPaa	Pinko, D&G. Those r the best!|`|HTZmT1KYaa	wedges!!! they are comfortable n pretty..|`|ZE2FbTgGaa	I suggest getting the PRETTIEST heels, then putting invisible gel pads that you can buy in them.  Fxck comfortable, as long as they are hot. The gel pads will make them comfy. :D<br>  <br>  <br>  Btw the gel pads I have are from a brand called Scholl.|`|szD8yYiXaa	Try wedges. Wedges are comfortable since they "absorb" the pressure created by your feet|`|qygYwdRpaa	Dr Scholl does the most gorgeous range of party clubbing shoes really hot two!! and made  with party feet in mind two
GO3UeFsOaa	I have long hair to and had the same problem but of you follow these tips and you will be fine:_<br>  <br>  1-Before you shampoo you brush your hair to remove any knots or tangles(of course when before you have your shower or bath and when your hair is not wet because brushing hair when its wet could cause hair loss!)<br>  <br>  2- With a comb split your hair to two sides .<br>  <br>  3- you start shampooing your first half of your hair from the bottom and work upwards .<br>  (try not to scrub too hard nor cause tangles or knots in your hair while washing it , don't rush)<br>  <br>  4- do the same thing with the other half of your hair.<br>  <br>  okay after having a bath/shower when your hair is wet it tends to be the weakest and brushing or combing  and tying your hair causes it to break easily , so just avoid brushing it or tying it when wet wait at least when it is half away dry. And if you can after washing your hair splash  your head in COLD water heard its good for long hair as it does something closing the pores from the  chemical residues from shampoos that may be left behind.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|3rC2REVlaa	no, your not scrubbing to hard. My hair is short and I get tangles in my hair too. The best way to shampoo your hair is lather some shampoo in your hair (but don't use too much) then apply from top to bottom of hair and rinse thoroughly. Try using a gentle shampoo and avoid alkaline shampoos as they weaken hair and washes out all the natural oil, causing it to dry out.|`|9uKEsG8Baa	yeah don't scrub to much gently wash it and quickly soaked it in mid hot water|`|JK8X2wA9aa	you apply shampoo to your scalp only. shampooing the tips  of your hair drys them out. you gently massage your scalp, for about a minute then rinse with warm water to help open up the hair cuticles.
SWbu1YQTaa	with a sewing needle or a fish hook|`|M725dpU6aa	Do NOT pop it. It may get infected, and eventually leave a scar that'll be even worse than it is now.<br>  <br>  Instead, put a dab of honey on it and cover it with a bandage, then leave it on for a few hours. Then when you take off the bandage it should be smaller, small enough to put concealer on it.|`|ZEPRrHttaa	Apply heat and moisture... once the pores are as open as they'll get squeeze from the outside and try to get to deep until you've squeezed as much as you can handle.<br>  Once finished, clean and disinfect with alcohol or better yet a hot lemon half (just roast it a bit) then to reduce any kind of scarring apply a bit of honey and place a band-aid over it for a few hours. then make sure you air it out so that it heals quick... which it will because of the honey!!<br>  <br>  Good luck beautiful!!|`|dDN1kFy5aa	Wash your hands before you pop it.<br>  After you do pop it, wash your entire face.<br>  <br>  But if you don't want a scar on your face, leave it alone.|`|gXUNVSgHaa	When its horrible, you either need to wait (I know uggh) or use cream on it like clearasilthat works pretty good, sorry!|`|oxBWUrGcaa	The best idea is not to pop it... but I've been there girl, sometimes you have to. Try gently applying warm water and pressure to it, try to let it shrink without totally "popping" it.|`|QLopvWKDaa	Place a very very warm wet,clean wash cloth on it and gently apply pressure to the area surrounding it-pinch the area around it not the "head" of it- if it "POPS", then apply a little rubbing alcohol to disinfect and speed in drying it out.|`|ZtCsn5mFaa	Just pop it and then wash your face and then let your pore close up.

V7VuXQo9aa	Cellulite is fatty deposits that are trapped in fluid and nothing will get rid of it. Massage helps diminish the fluid that surrounds the fatty deposits, reducing the appearance but nothing will ever break it down. Lots of products will help reduce the appearance but don't be tempted to spend a lot. Infact the best thing you could ever do is buy a good oil like Elemis Japanese Camillia oil and massage the area firmily every day. If you look at packaging on cellulite products, they all instruct you to massage for 10+mins. This is the main key in combating cellulite, not the actual products. Even massaging firmly with your normal daily body moisturiser will help, always massage in the direction towards the heart.

I love a bit of a messy, floppy look that's been chopped into a bit, as in Hugh Grant, Adrien Brody etc. ... very hot, but doesn't work so well with curly hair. Maybe go the Wolfmother look if youve got curls? Go with Stickman's advice too. A hairdresser will be able to style it for you and it's always a good idea to take along a photo of someone whose hair you like (see above!!!)<br>  Hope this helps.

b0bxLXr8aa	first of all it's not discrimination if it is in the employee handbook or rules.  Second i would say dye it darker rather than trying to bleach it blonder.  Try the semi-permanent color and that way when it does wash out it will tone down the red color.  Good Luck!|`|bBJXp9oFaa	It really depends how strict the manager is to see if you'd get in trouble.<br>  And oh my god, you should really wait awhile after you dye your hair to dye your hair again.

My advice would be to get a semi permanent dye that is a darker more 'natural' color.  This will usually wash out eventually, but will neutralize and make the result (after wash out) more subtle.  I would try that.  If not, go for a permanent darker red.  Eventually, go back to your natural color and get it cut off as short as you can take it.  Then it will become 'healthy' again.  But, hair can't really be healthy, as it is dead.  But this will make it look and feel better.  Also, always ALWAYS, use deep conditioning treatments once a week, and condition after ever shampoo leaving conditioner on for at least 2 minutes.  I usually leave it on while I wash the rest.  Good Luck :o)<br>  <br>  <br>  IF YOU STRIP IT, IT COULD MAKE IT BREAK OFF WORSE.  The chemicals used to strip it are really harsh.

A bracelet or a beautiful picture frame is ok.. with pictures of both of u in it.. not only one picture but use a lot of pictures then cut and paste them down. paste it all in one paper and put in the picture frame..

It's more opinion than help! srry! :)|`|ECDYZk1iaa	coming from a licensed cosmetologist i would start with a hair cut, short maybe a fade, then while you are at the salon you could get you eyebrows waxed just to get the shape going and then after that you could keep up with tweezing them if you don't want to wax anymore!!! And yes of course smiling would add the final touch!!! good luck :)|`|DdHxOW5saa	your eyebrows are just a bit bushy, but I don't suggest getting them ultra-plucked, just a tiny trim, since your eyebrows are forming your eyes well.

d2oou05Kaa	you should go to your doctor,|`|uJJPFJoyaa	I doubt its an infection. This is normal during the healing process. What had happen is the piercer has possibly placed in a stud w/ a small gem. Usually when nose piercings are done the gem is usually larger so that it won't sink into your nose during the healing process. You can  go back to the piercer and ask she/he if they can change out the jewelry for a larger size gem to prevent the piercing from sinking, they would be able to help you. The gem on the end of the stud isn't too large usually 3mm compared to a 1-2mm which is smaller.|`|qWBeK5UXaa	That happend to me and I was so scared it was infected, but don't worry , it shouldn't be , it was probably caused by the swelling and the general healing of the piercing , just leave it alone and it will come back out on its own(: But , if it doesn't, go to a doctor becuase it might need to be cut out|`|j8wVDlcsaa	well the nose ring is supose to be flat against your face but if its to close its either it swelling<br>  or your nose ring is to small<br>  i highly doubt its an infection<br>  if your really that scared about it call the place you got it done and ask them<br>  maybe go in to see them so they can take a look at it<br>  <br>  also if the stud is to small they could swap it out for a bigger one or you could get a ring which personally i think its easier to take care of with the ring<br>  <br>  hope i helped :]]<br>  -Kesi|`|KC1xFM1Maa	Hmmm, I never had this problem...<br>  It sounds like it's swelling a bit, or the skin seems to want to grow over it. Whatever you do, I suggest that you don't take it out, because then it will close. Just continue washing it with anti-bacterial soap and DON'T USE HYDROGEN PEROXIDE OR RUBBING ALCOHOL, which breaks down the newly pierced skin. If it does get worse though, I suggest that you got to your piercer or doctor and see whats up. <br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|LZurbLrvaa	that might happen if the area that you pierce is swollen,or the stud that that was put into it is too small.you could use a small wash rag with some warm salt water and place it on the area 2 times for the day you may see some results.|`|zANFZ53gaa	Its an infection. Your nose has gotten puffy around that area as expected. Clean it out and it should be ok in a matter of days.

I don't know if you can get it where you live but if you can it's really great. It makes your lashes really long but true to its word doesn't clump at all, atleast for me. The brush head is plastic though :P|`|AA12363402	I like Maybelline in the super skinny tube. It has a tiny brush that believe it or not is so perfect for putting on mascara perfectly!

It is amazing!!<br>  I've been using it for about a year now and I've always found it hard finding a good mascara but now I've found this one I'd definitely suggest you give it a go.<br>  If you buy some eyelash curlers and curl your lashes then apply a coat, and curl your lashes again about 10 minutes later and apply another coat they stay curled all day and don't need a touch up. Plus the two coats make your lashes really long and the brush makes them really defined and stops them from clumping together.<br>  Their are a couple of different telescopic mascaras, their is the regular gold tube, the silver tube, the carbon black tube and the blue waterproof tube and they're all the same as each other to be honest in terms of the legthening and definition, the only one that's particularly different is the waterproof one but for obvious reasons :) it does the same things though as the other three so it doesn't matter which tube you buy cos they all do the job :) x|`|plmMzEaCaa	I really like Maybelline X-tra mascara with the white and black ends, but i do find it can be a bit full-on for everyday wear.

Purples and greens are good, and so are smoky gray, gold, bronze, copper, peach, smoky pinks, gray/blues, dark brown, beige, cream, vanilla, white, the list is endless.

It'll be fun, and you get to try out different things. Also, if you see something that you like, you can get it for a nice price. <br>  <br>  Ask someone older for advice. You'd be surprise at how much moms know about these stuff. <br>  <br>  Basic steps:<br>  <br>  1. Wash your face. <br>  <br>  2. Put on some type of moisturizer. <br>  <br>  3. Put on foundation, either liquid or powder. If liquid, squeeze very littly amount out of tube, and dot it at forehead, chin, and two cheeks. Spread evenly. Powder just dust lightly. <br>  <br>  4. Put primer first, if want eyeshadow to stay longer. Step is optional. <br>  <br>  5. Pick a color for eyeshadow, and apply onto lid. For beginngers, choose a light shade (like pale pink/blue) so even if it does look messy, it won't be that noticeable. Again, only a bit, and it'll look nicely. <br>  <br>  6. Put on blush. Just brush lightly at cheekbones. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. |`|MKL9hQNqaa	mac<br>  if you go to their store they'll help you and with applying it and everything you need
abD9tXHWaa	yehh go swimming.<br>  <br>  haven't you realised, people with tattoos never go swimming! EVER.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ;)|`|P2PPy6E8aa	what is it of???<br>  only laser treatments will make it disapear<br>  nothin else<br>  sorryy l|`|0ef851000b538b263ac2c3058c608291aa	burn it off with a blow torch or a hot iron.|`|rOj4B5QNaa	Yes it can have the color drawn out, but honestly not even that will happen.  There is a possibility of it getting infected because there is so much bacteria in the water and it is an open wound while it is still healing.  There are no home removals that are safe.  Your best bet would be to keep it hidden until you can afford laser treatments.|`|Wd8MENRiaa	you really should have thought about this before getting the tat. basically the only way to remove it is to go to a specialist dermatologist who can blast it with a laser to break down the pigments, but this can take several treatments and will cost and will hurt, also you do not want to get your tattoo infected, skin infections are very nasty|`|vZ4NXlBmaa	Swimming does not "get rid of" tattoos<br>  it just puts you at risk for infections<br>  <br>  and creams do not work.......honestly<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  just face the music........you did a stupid/irresponsible/immature thing<br>  don't keep adding onto the stupidity.......come clean|`|BkdZq0QPaa	it'll get infected but thats it<br>  you can only reallu get it tattooed over or lazered<br>  <br>  and theres no such thing as removel cream|`|d2798492cb1675fbe0dfc5007748dc18aa	yes..if you spend the next fifty years swimming ,you're tattoo will eventually fade but not go altogether..i sugest having the part of you're body that the tattoo is on amputated..this is the most effective way of removing tattoos..and no you wont get the tattooo infected when you are swimming,i hope this answers your problem.|`|waDgUsbTaa	hopefully if heaps of people say the same thing you will relize how stuffed you are and rethink your next stupid decision. Even if you get rid of some of the tatoo a lot of it will stay so it will just look even more messed up. Lazering is the only removal method and its expensive and painful. tatoos are life long additions so you should have maybe done a little reasearch and given it a bit of thought, not anti tatoo here i have 5 and plan more, but at the same time, i love all 5. good luck, and don't try anything stupid to remove it|`|AA11815871	It could get infected in a pool, all those germs from other people...yuck.  Also, it will just ruin the colour, it will not draw it all out and leave you with blank skin again, sorry.  Consider a cover up if you don't like what you have, or laser removal, but don't try home-made methods of removal, it just doesn't work.|`|EKFyplGjaa	Leave it. Fess up to your parents about your stupid decision. Somewhere down the lines, when you are SURE of what you want, what it means to you and have found a great, sanitary artist with an impressive portfolio, get it covered up with something better.|`|rAe3tyBPaa	if its a fresh tattoo and you go swimming in a public pool the only thing that will happen is the chlorine will draw the color out, so if its black it will go green but it wont get rid of it it'll just look stupid|`|qJtPcrWTaa	no swimming won't get rid of it.<br>  swimming in a public pool you prolly won't get infected|`|3pQFUhbiaa	What is it of? Swimming won't get rid of it. You would have to get it laserd off. |`|03S5dz6Caa	First off, why would you get a tattoo if you weren't sure you wanted it?<br>  <br>  No, swimming won't remove it. It can only be removed by laser.<br>  Think before you act. It could get infected by doing "home-made methods" and just leaving you with a big ugly scar.|`|8eskArmyaa	What you can do is get it lasered off.<br>  Or just leave it on and think about why the hell you got it in the first place if you never wanted it!|`|mOQv6oR6aa	u wont get rid of it with swimming, unless ur swimming with lazers|`|lMroW3aaaa	This kind of question just makes me wet my self laughing<br>  <br>  WHAT A RETARD!!!!
AA11119636	where exactly on your back?<br>  <br>  if it's in the middle, where your vertebra is it'll hurt like 6~8 depends on your pain tolerance but if it's right or left shouldn't be too bad b/c there are more meat in the area...so 4~6 <br>  <br>  my upper middle back about a 5<br>  my arm sleeve about a 2|`|lwnH4Es3aa	The worst it gets is a little bee stink nothing at all I dont think it hurts unless you think about it being a needle |`|ben0NvDDaa	Everyones pain tolerance is different.  I find it more annoying than painful, but my best friend considers it horribly painful (but she also cries when she gets her eyebrows waxed).  So no one on here can really tell you how you will judge it.  The tattoo you are looking at is small so its a good one to start with.  And for a normal person, it shouldn't be something that you can't tolerate.  If tattoos really hurt that much, there wouldn't be so many people getting them :)|`|YyV2X96Xaa	You shouldn't worry about the pain, it shouldn't change your mind about whether or not to get the tattoo.<br>  <br>  It depends on your pain tolerance and also how important and meaningful the tattoo is to you, the pain is worth it in the end if its something that you care about. The tattoo is forever really and the pain is not.|`|t44168wJaa	it hurts the same all over  but it is sort of like a stinging burning sensation, and a slight warning they are addictive so it doesn't hurt that bad iwould say a 5 maybe|`|opEC3rrfaa	It feels like the tip of a knife being dragged across your skin. More irritating than painful. |`|MLYkzGHaaa	well ive never got a tattoo before but i want 1 so i asked 2 of my friends who already got tattoo's & on your lower back it should hurt about an 7-8 and on the back of your shoulder it should hurt about a 6-7 (i hope i could be of some help to you & good luck just close your eyes and pray while your getting the tattoo it should be over before you know it)|`|nbI8lScKaa	Um.<br>  I don't think it will hurt that bad. It might sting just a little bit,but it really depends on your pain tolerance. All tattoos hurt,they just hurt more in sensitive areas. So, I think that you'll be fine. It's tottally worth it though. But be sure to take care of it && don't let it get infected. <br>  <br>  |`|IozKJEkXaa	They don't hurt as bad as you think they do. would rate it between a 4-5 not too bad, and def. worth it. Good luck :)|`|X8eewwHVaa	just when it 1st starts depending where you get it..it goes kinda numb after 15 minutes. its worth it|`|0617e7b8b524dfbfe2eb598bf033a8d1aa	Tattos do hurt like ALOT!!! i got one yday one my lower stomach it was an amature one..so yah!! but I'd say 7/8!!
47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	considering you have to wait six weeks for a new piercing to heal, you wont be able to stretch them at all because your piercing is still healing...<br>  <br>   and yeah, stretching them will just keep the wound open, leading to a MUCH higher chance of infection.<br>  <br>  alright, thank you for clearing that up, i was like "wait what?", lol.<br>  <br>    ummm...in six weeks i still dont think your gonna get very far.  like, 2 sizes above the standard gague is about it because you do NOT want to rush sizes and i have had professional piercers suggest waiting six weeks between sizes...so honestly i hate to burst your bubble but i dont think your going to get them as big as you want in six weeks.  like, if your ears are really stretchy and you can get the new gague in without forcing it, yeah go for it, but if your trying to get a new size in and it hurts or you REALLY have to force it, then your going to fast.  also, NEVER SKIP SIZES! skipping sizes just makes you that much more likely to break the skin open again.<br>  <br>    i generally leave mine in for at least three weeks to a month before i try to go up in sizes, and i have had piercers say that six weeks is ideal so incase you DO break skin, you give it time to heal like a normal piercing|`|JAgnYVAiaa	you shouldn't do it in 6 weeks that's not enough time. at least wait 3 months so that your ears will heal. once they are healed you can stretch and make sure you wait a month inbetween stretches once you start and never skip sizes. its not a race you have to take good care of your ears.|`|Qwg4n3hhaa	my ears are a 0,<br>  i started stretching in may & was a 0 by july.<br>  id say wait a month after piercing them and begin<br>  stretching, i went from 22 to a 10 to a 6 to a 4 to a 0.<br>  i say anywhere from 2 weeks to a month, inbetween <br>  each is what i would personallyt do but apparently <br>  you can have blow outs, so they reccomend a month.<br>  <br>  but i say **** it, lol.|`|20s7t80uaa	I'm sorry, but you really really really shouldn't stretch them at all for six weeks, if you really want to at the very end, go ahead. but try REALLY hard not to rip your skin, that will leave scar tissue and look gross.|`|Eyn9462Paa	my segestion is dont get it if it goes to far it wont grow back and a lot of people look down on that i kno a lot of girls who are disgusted by that too|`|Me43X2C3aa	You need to wait like 6 months until you can start stretching. Unless you want permanently damaged ears.
AYxLrFCHaa	yea|`|1rMEP8HAaa	Yes it is possible to tattoo over astretch mark you can not get herpes or anything just because the skin type is diifferent although you are still going to see the stretch mark due to the diffrence in skin texture|`|YXXvhDLWaa	Yep you can. I will warn you though, with mine the skin really puffed up, brusied a little and was sore for many days. Now with mine you cannot see the strech mark in my tattoo at all unless you are right up on top of it. |`|uTKCjmKgaa	yeah totally, i have stretch marks, but i have tattoos over some of them, they are more difficult for a tattoo artist to tattoo because the structure of the skin has changed, but provided the stretch marks are old enough most tattooers will do it, basically if they look pretty similar to your skin colour they will tattoo them,<br>  if they are pink, purple, slightly bluey etc (which indicates they are fairly recent they wont do it) because recent ones are likely to rip or cause the ink to leak into the rest of the stretch mark.<br>  <br>  forgot to add you wont get herpes if you get tattoos on strecthmarks. the only way you get herpes is with unclean needles, not where the needle is used on your skin.|`|tj7D1Mywaa	If you want herpies in that spot you can.|`|TDtSZLmvaa	yes you can.|`|bdOFHGHraa	ye but when the stretch marks go down the tattoo will shrink where the stretch marks are
lebKMTaQaa	I've never had that happen to me because, well, I have no tattoos (until next week that is)! These type of people are very ignorant and don't know what the true scripture says. The Bible states that you should not mark your body in times of grief. Not in general, but in times of grief. The reason for this even being in the Bible is that some cultures with other religious systems would tattoo or use scarification in the grief process as a healing ritual. So to eliminate the other religions, Christians made the practice taboo.<br>  <br>  Quite similar to the Christians stealing the Horned Man god from the pagan system of beliefs and turning him into the image of Satan. There are, in fact, many examples of other religious practices and beliefs being turned into "evil" symbols and actions by the Biblical faiths. All of these were simply to eliminate competing and "old" religious practices.<br>  <br>  Ironically, many of the oldest churches were built by pagans, muslims, and other non-Christian people who would "hide" their own religious symbols in the architecture of the Christian churches they built!<br>  <br>  Goes to show, the ones with the biggest mouths actually have no idea what their own religious beliefs are! I have never known a priest or minister to do such things, they are usually very open minded to other faiths.<br>  <br>  My body is a temple, and I will adorn it as I see fit!|`|NJaBS4smaa	I have several tats and used to have a ponytail to boot. I had just come from church and was going to lunch at Marie Callender's (a US restaurant chain) with some friends; a glassy-eyed lady and tie-wearing, clean-cut man came up to me and said, "I used to be like you, please read this" and handed me a religious tract telling me how to get saved. I smiled politely and told them I already was a Christian, thank you very much. She refused to take her tract back and kept saying, "Just read it, it will help you." I guess she couldn't believe a person with long hair could possibly be a Christian.  I know they just meant well, didn't hurt me any.|`|okTecGZfaa	Yes, I have been, but nothing on the scale of what you experienced in that episode. I usually take it with a grain of salt since I'm conscious of that the fact that others are not required to like or approve of everything I do. However, that doesn't mean it's ok to be disrespectful about not liking it.|`|lwnH4Es3aa	Please read the whole answer!<br>  <br>  Ya ppl complain about my tats because I am a christian and in the Bible it says not to permanently make your body-but is speaking in reference of idol worship!<br>  <br>  So ppl wont go to hell if they have tats it just overly uptight christains that act like that<br>  <br>  I got 4 my self got one fri before last<br>  <br>  And if they were christians that so cared about the bible they would not have jugged you and would have had the respect to leave a tip! I REALLY GET ANNOYED WITH CHRISTIANS LIKE THAT BECAUSE THEN PPL THINK IM GONNA BE LIKE HAT JUST CUZ I AM OPEN ABOUT MY FAITH!<br>  <br>  At least I am not the only one then haha I was reading other ppls answers good cuz some time I kinda start to question me but only for like 2 seconds cuz I realize they are just being butt wholes|`|uTKCjmKgaa	haha!! i got the exact same thing but i've had it from christians, and jews. hooray. telling me that it is against god to mark my body, i have mutilated the creation of the lord, blah blah blaaahhh. and then ive had the people who just hate tattoos for no real reason telling me im going to regret them, and hate my body for the rest of my life etc etc etc.<br>  <br>  its always so nice, when people who CLAIM to be accepting of others, to love all humans as equal, that god forgives mistakes, go out on a full frontal personal attack, telling me i look grotesque and i am going to rot in hell. coz of course, god's gunna be reaaallll angry, that i have a couple pictures of flowers on me. and not go be angry at the people who have deliberate set out to belittle others "in his name".<br>  <br>   can't tell it narks me at all can ya?? lol|`|9026b2bbf9a993654d7497a995592bcfaa	Nothing that bad to me but I had friends of a friend telling me how I am going to hate them and why would I get one on my neck for when I get a "mom" haircut. I told them I was boring followers like them and I'm not going to cut off all my hair one day....they are like " yes you will, you have too" then what are you going to do, you will regret all the tattoos so much. Like someday I would think I am trash. THey wouldn't let it go. |`|AA11815871	Oh yes, I had all that too from a member of my former church, total lunatic, I doubt that having art on your skin means you will end up in hell.|`|jsDZdBPcaa	No, thankfully. I would seriously go insane on someone if they did that to me.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	YES! i have.  omg it was highlarious.  i have a heartagram tattooed on my ankle because i love the band HIM, and it reminds me of the good times i had in finland.  this guy saw it one day, IMMEDIATLY just assumed it was a pentagram, and went on about the whole fire and  brimstone crap.   i actually pointed at it and said "see, its a HEART! its for a BAND that is NOT satanic, and furthermore, if your so religious what are you doing looking me up and down which you obviously had to do in order to see my tattoo?"  like, my tatt isnt big but any twat with half a loaf can see that it is not a pentagram.  the line about him looking me up and down shut him up real quick, it was funny as hell.<br>  <br>    although im goth so people just automaticly assume i worship satan just by looking at me(which is dumb, because i dont), so idk.  i wasnt dressed particularly goth that day, and he didnt mention my clothes, just my tattoo.<br>  <br>    i cant wait to see what happens when i get my back piece, theres a skull involved in that....|`|rR6lwxjjaa	yeah, but i just told them to **** off.<br>  <br>  lol i dont really care about those kinds of people

uTKCjmKgaa	go to a tattoo artist, they will know what would work, for covering it up, or they may suggest lasering it off if there is no way they can see of doing a cover up, maybe to get rid of the whole tattoo, or to fade it if it is particularly dark. no-one can really tell you for sure as there is no picture to go on and even then colours can look like or darker than they actually are. <br>  <br>  as i said go talk to someone who knows what they are doing and can see it first hand.<br>  <br>  and yellow, wont cover ANYTHING. except possibly white ink. its a fairly weak colour, so unless you are planning on making your tattoo a fair bit larger, you cant be expecting to use yellow in a cover up.|`|PVgMArd9aa	If you just want a cover up mate the tat will combine a good colur n mix, however if u want it gone get the skin textured ink if itz not 2 heavy, i just had 2 cover ups on my neck with it the guy made a great job.. Good Luck...|`|euZRbiA2aa	im afraid only a tattoo artist who sees your tat can answer that.|`|XnogyuCKaa	go and c a GOOD tattoo artist show em what you have and want and c what they can come up with gd luck

W1UHwwsoaa	I am white and I had a weave. It was very expensive but beautiful! You cut out the thread that is woven into your hair not your hair itself. Braiding your hair will damage it. So does the weight of the weave.|`|4Bj5ki79aa	its tue|`|mnAFVaK5aa	Yeah that is true.|`|d0aYyZwgaa	yea i kind of cut my hair takin it out but it didnt damage it and it grew back soo im fine now
Xq8nStTfaa	No, solely because it burns hair over 14 times more then straightening dry hair. They have certain straighteners made for wet hair, that are less damaging (..wet 2 straight)|`|wajI2ACLaa	There is a straighter you could use on wet hair.<br>  Remington's Wet2Straight|`|I4RhWK5Eaa	first of all, it just doens't sound good!<br>  SIZZLEPOP<br>  ahahah it freaks me out. im such a hair freak.<br>  its like frying it literally too. zapping your hair with a straightener when its wet is kinda like microwaving chicken. its takes out all the moisture and ruins all the hard work you put into it to make it taste (or look) good.|`|zKlqIgFkaa	when your hair is wet it is at its most venrable if you know what i mean,so it easily splits or comes out.<br>  streightners burn your hair when its wet<br>  |`|WYuIwhsKaa	1) Burns hair<br>  2) MAKES hair FRIZZY <trust me><br>  3) it looks straight but later ....WATCH!<br>  <br>  and i guess that's it.|`|1SXHrlrQaa	Because it will burn your hair. |`|wK5okobNaa	You can use some straightners on wet hair, i have one that is made to use on wet hair, its called wet2style by remington i think. But most straighners you cant use on wet hair because it will damage it, and it wont straighten all the way. |`|o60ZeWs6aa	Well there is the straighteners that reduce that, but i think it is just because it will damage your hair including giving you many split ends, other than that i'm not entirely sure|`|6JAPrw21aa	Yess. It will just fry your hair and it could cause, in the best possible scenario, split ends and in the worst case scenario, alopecia! I don't advise it :P|`|s8dJRVgQaa	wet2style! i have one, i love it. lol i dont know who its by..... but yeah works on wet damp or dry hair just use different settings|`|HL9F9Y5gaa	Yes it does damage the hair + it burns it<br>

MFUfXB9Caa	Whenever you feel ready to start experimenting with it. I first started wearing it when I was 14.|`|6gQWdDWmaa	I started wearing mascara and very pale brown eyeliner when I was 10, but only to our school discos, and that was because I got moved up a year at school so all my friends, who were also wearing mascara and eyeliner were all 11 and 12, so I had to start earlier to fit in. I started wearing make up regularly when i was about 11, but my mum would only let me wear a bit of foundation and mascara. Now I'm 15 and I wear full but light make up every day and have done since i was about 12. Really it depends on when you want to start wearing it and when your parents are comfortable with you wearing it. My mum's reasoning was that she started wearing full make-up when she was 12 so she could hardly not let me.|`|ZpefK0sgaa	7th grade CLEAR mascara<br>  8th CLEAAARRR mascara<br>  high school Black mascara NEVER use any eyeliner i started && it is adicting you look SICK w/out it so don't get into this bad habit of eyeliner everyday it SUCKSS<br>  but you can wear a lil on special occassions okay??<br>  here r some pics<br>  7th & 8th CLEAR MASCARA <a href="http://blog.thehandcraftedwedding.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/05/20/eye1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://blog.thehandcraftedwedding.com/ph...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.xarj.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/megan-fox4.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.xarj.net/wp-content/uploads/2...</a><br>  <br>  highschool  BLACK MASCARA ONLY<br>   <a href="http://www.napoleonperdis.com/getlook/images/HSN-BA_mascara.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.napoleonperdis.com/getlook/im...</a><br>  <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DSZ29nagI5E/SQCSkdusAbI/AAAAAAAAABQ/bBEOK7fE6sI/s400/loreal+double+extend+mascara+before+after.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DSZ29nagI5E/SQ...</a><br>  <a href="http://foreveramber.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/08/24/bourjois_volume_clubbing_ma_5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://foreveramber.typepad.com/photos/u...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.longerlashesnaturally.com/images/el_after_mascara.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.longerlashesnaturally.com/ima...</a><br>  <br>  special occassiouns you do mascara eyeliner & eyeshadow like this<br>  <a href="http://www.hipgirlie.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/megan_fox.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hipgirlie.com/wp-content/uplo...</a><br>  <a href="http://images.askmen.com/photos/megan-fox/33676.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.askmen.com/photos/megan-fo...</a><br>  <a href="http://fileserver.glam.com/glampress/beauty/Rihanna2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://fileserver.glam.com/glampress/bea...</a><br>  <a href="http://fileserver.glam.com/glampress/beauty/slideshows/Angelina-Jolie-Cat-Eyes.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://fileserver.glam.com/glampress/bea...</a><br>  hope that helps|`|o9VKZKpQaa	i started at thirteen,<br>  cos your just a  teenager,<br>  so you try new things.<br>  <br>  including eyeliner,<br>  ;)|`|6HP348pAaa	I started wearing Mascara when I was 13.

32Ey6Eu5aa	Well, I have a family member that is african american, and has extremely long hair. First off, heavy greases are a no-no. They will clog the hair follicles. And, how long is your hair? Until your hair is settled pretty well on your shoulders, it should be kept up, to prevent the ends of the hair to continually fray on the surface of your clothing. Don't wash your hair too often, either. You want your hair to produce enough of its own healthy oils to keep your hair comfortable. And, overall, experiment, and research. At some point in time, you'll find something that really works. Good Luck!|`|UzATwcHUaa	I go to JC Penney and wash my hair and condition it with KeraCare.  I moisture my hair with Shea And Cocoa Hair Cream from www.mineralindulgence.com.  I wash and condition my hair once a week.|`|f5xC1iSSaa	i wash mines every two weeks and perm every 6<br>  my mother is a beautician <br>  so i know the importance of keeping your hair moisturized<br>  |`|g1bjQd5eaa	I'm not African-American, but I have coarse hair and tend to use products meant for ethnic hair. Do you have a Sally's near you? I use their Generic Biolage Conditioning Balm as a rinse-out, and Lustrasilk Olive Oil Cholesterol as a leave-in. <br>  <br>  I also don't use sulfate shampoo - lots of girls use VO5 Clarifying Conditioner to condition-wash their hair. Here's the theory: <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-Girl-Method-for-Curly-Hair" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...</a><br>  <br>  I use aloe vera gel to style, but I know that doesn't work well for everyone. L'Oreal has this stuff called Out of Bed that a lot of people like - it's kind of an odd consistency gel product.<br>  <br>  All of those products are around $5 or less. :) Good luck!|`|d0aYyZwgaa	hey, <br>           i use motions, ask beauty suppt store about where it is they have everything you could ever want . even if your on a budget. idk wats it callec right now but i use all the green bottled motions i think its like fruit essenices of something|`|QLq8d01baa	My beauticuan uses Design Essentials on my hair and it works great!! You can get it at places like JCPenney. I wash my hair evry two weeks and relaxer every 6 weeks.|`|FxZMHwNJaa	First question, Do you wear a perm? This already is the number one problem since it actually will cause breakage in the long run. Many african american women make statements about there hair "not growing". However, their hair is growing it is just breaking off from constant styling, perms, stress, and petroleum based products. Check the ingredients of your hair products. The website listed has information on what you should and should not put in your hair. There is also a website with a blog on the issue that can be very helpful to you.<br>  <br>  I recently chopped all my hair off and went natural at the end of July. In October my hair was at the bottom of my neck. I have coarse, curly, nappy (loving it) hair, but it grows and its beautiful. I use only Dr. Bonners products, which contain no harmful ingredients, and I minimize my styling. I wash it once every week and I am going to start doing an Apple Cider Vinegar rinse to remove build up. I can clearly see results with growth. <br>  <br>  I locked my hair October 31 this year and it is just about to go past my shoulders. |`|oQ854rUXaa	I use the Kera care line ,it works really good, I wash and condition  my hair every other day,the more you keep your hair and scalp clean,the more it grows! a clean scalp is number 1, also hot oil treatments every two weeks is a plus also!! <br>  Good Luck!!
XaYHMNusaa	Silicone isn't recommended for stretching b/c it's not really "solid" [not like glass, titanium, niobium, surgical steel, which are all acceptable for stretching].  Also, in fresh stretches, silicone can/will stick to the fistulas of the piercings and cause lots of damage.

fRX6sSdTaa	If you're going to be walking a lot it all depends on what you're feet are most comfy walking in.  I wear flats and flip flips (flats look nicer though).<br>  <br>  Flats don't have much support though so if you're looking for support you could for a flat that isn't quite as flat.  One that has a thicker sole and more side will offer more support.  But it all depends, I wore flip flops and flats that are really flat everyday on my trip to orlando and I was fine.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|YS4wfSaJaa	Well its kinda tottaly up to your style.

DfDss68haa	I don't know. But go to nappturality.com, there is an entire forum dedicated to starting and maintaining dreads. And if you still feel you need a pro, someone there has to live in Washington. Ask them. <br>  <br>  And here are some tips directly from someone who had dreads I got from naturallycurly.com<br>  <br>  {{{{1. you can start your locs and maintain them by yourself. you can start them with 2-strand twists, palm-rolled coils, braids, or freeform from an afro. however you choose to start them, make sure the base of the loc is about the thickness of a pencil. if they are too thin, you'll experience breakage down the road. if they are too thick, it will take longer for them to matt and loc and the individual locs will be heavier as they mature, which can cause stress on your scalp years down the road. <br>  <br>  2. you do not have to forgo cleansing your scalp to form locs. your scalp should be shampooed 1-2 times a week just to keep sebum and perspiration washed away. don't worry about coils or twists unraveling. redo the ones that become undone or just leave them alone and let them loc that way.<br>  <br>  3. choose a residue-free shampoo. you won't want to use conditioning shampoos that leave your hair coated, nor will you want to use leave-in conditioners, as they attract lint and dirt, which will embed in the locs and make them dirty and difficult to get totally clean. your focus should be on cleansing your scalp. a light, natural oil smoothed throughout your locs should be an adequate conditioner. avoid wax, shea butter, cocoa butter, coconut oil, pretty much anything that is solid at room temperature. it will create a nasty buildup within your locs that will never come out, no matter how much clarifying you do. trust me, i've seen it, and what you'll end up with are clean-looking locs on the outside, but nasty ooze from product buildup on the inside of each loc, which will make them feel heavy in time. clean locs should feel light and spongy, regardless of texture.<br>  <br>  4. some people have good results with liquid castile soap as a shampoo. just be mindful to dilute really well because these soaps can leave residue if you aren't careful.<br>  <br>  5. personally, i would use a nonsoap cleansing method like a baking soda paste with a couple of drops of oil added and rubbed into the scalp, then rinsed away. or green clay, which is a good skin cleanser and will wash away easily under a steady stream of water. <br>  <br>  6. buy a nice scarf (satin, cotton, silk, whatever) to keep your hair wrapped at night or when you are lounging around or in windy weather when dust is blowing around to prevent lint and debris from becoming trapped in your locs, as you won't be able to brush or comb or even pick out debris as easily as you would with loose hair.<br>  <br>  7. be patient with the formation of your locs. if you have multiple textures on your head, as many people do, you may notice that parts of your head will loc faster than others. everyone goes through an awkward stage of locing in the beginning. you can use scarves, head wraps, etc., to get through those periods.<br>  <br>  8. your locs can be manicured, meaning, you will want to keep all fuzziness at bay by twisting your newgrowth regularly, showing evenly parted sections on your scalp. or you may want semi freeform, where you simply gently pull apart your locs after a fresh shampoo to discourage the fuzzies from matting and connecting locs. or you may want to have organic locs, in which you will let your hair do what it will do, creating spaghetti thin locs in some places, and fat ones in other areas. most people don't wear organic locs, especially if they plan to work in corporate environments. if you plan to have manicured locs, just make sure you don't overtwist them, as the constant twisting of the new growth can weaken the base of your locs and create breakage down the road. there are some people who use crochet-like hooks to keep the base of their locs from fuzzing too much. it's called latching. you can do a search for that. personally, that seems too time-consuming and unnatural. but everything isn't for everyone.<br>  <br>  i don't know of any cons of having loced hair. as long as they are clean and clear of lint and dirt, as long as your scalp is regularly cleansed from the beginning and is healthy, your loced hair can be as flattering and fun as any other natural hairstyle.}}}}}|`|d554b01f24aafacca61036628777e067aa	any hair shop...one run by black people would be the best bet
A9sLvVDxaa	BE YOURSELF!!!<br>  <br>  I cannot stress that enough. Guys hate games, lies and masks. Also guys can be stubborn and shy, and they have difficulty expressing themselves. A guy who likes you may say something like, "you look terrible in red" which actually means, "Y'know last week, when you wore that blue thing, that was amazing, you looked great in that!"<br>  <br>  I'm a guy, we're dumb. I'm gay, but I still can't talk to a pretty girl. I jibber and say stupid things. If you reach out a touch a guy, like on the shoulder, even if you're just being friendly and the guy jumps a lil, or shrugs off your hand. It's because he wants you to touch him, but he doesn't want you to know that, because it makes him uncomfortable, but he really really really wants you to touch him again.<br>  <br>  Just be yourself. If you like dressing up and wearing makeup, then do that. But if it's not your thing, then wear whatever you like. There will be at least one guy who will think you're the sexiest girl he's ever seen. Even when you're having a bad day, he'll want to kiss you. Guys get turned on by weird things. <br>  <br>  Like hair over the face, that's hot. A big grin or a simple smile when you make eye contact. Guys like to feel useful, ask him to do something for you, even if you know you can do it yourself...but don't abuse this too much. <br>  <br>  Again, I say, be you, and you'll drive the boys cwazy!|`|z0tk6XSvaa	try taking care of your self; whiten your teeth keep your hair clean, soft, shiny, and not frizzy. take care of your body exersize, eat healthy, drink a lot of water. Wear perfume that smells good like vanilla. Try giving him cinnamon gum it stimulates the senses. And touch his left arm (the right side of the brain is the emmotional side) try being yourself and the person you want to be because the guy you want to be with will have to like you for you or its just not going to work out.|`|u8slDDkLaa	one thing i know is that guys like a challenge do not be too available like and too hard to get be in the middle have confidence and be your self<br>  flirt a little and talk to them present your self well and do not to girlish be relax<br>  be smart funny<br>  exciting <br>  the boys i like is kinda sensitive and masculine<br>  funny intelligent( nerdy)<br>  affectionate exciting protective but not over protective down to earth  skater boyish nerdy they have to be older than me i like experience in life and not abusive or know it all successful comnpatible and not so perfect|`|4fdd090bca85bce943cf1774cbba61f9aa	The key is not try too hard because you might get asked out but it will end up badly.<br>  <br>  It depends on the type of male you want to attract. <br>  <br>  For me I am attracted to girls who are smart and witty but do not necessarily brag about it. I do not like girls who act like they do not know what is going on or truly do not know what is going on. I like girls who are funny and talkative and don't mind showing their vibrant personality.<br>  <br>  You should dress in a way that would attract the type of guy you are looking for. Personally, I would classify myself as a preppy dresser and I am attracted to preppy girls (not the cheerleader / A&F type but the real preppy girls) with an impeccable fashion sense, a very vibrant personality, intelligence, and conservative morals.<br>  <br>  Basically, dress in an attractive way, take care of your body, and show that you have personality.
er1jmyhBaa	I've never been sent home for since through elementary school and middle we had uniforms, rarely anybody got sent home. In high school I haven't been sent home, though I am sad they don't allow flip flops.|`|AA10065077	I have an issue wearing scrubs for primary care. When I was doing a family medicine rotation ( I was in an emergency medicine residency) my first year ( intern) I was dressed business casual with my white lab coat on. The doctor that I was working with dressed the same everyday. I was told by my residency director that I needed to wear my personalized scrubs that I had issued to me. I could wear those under my lab coat, but I couldn't wear anything else. I didn't argue, I just changed. When asked why I hated scrubs, I just replied that I don't hate scrubs I just wanted to wear what everyone else ( doctor wise) was wearing so I didn't stick out.
cZ4sO7zXaa	definitely ebay. i'm actually waiting for my pair of wayfarers to be shipped right now. just search for "white wayfarer sunglasses" and you should get tons of hits. amazing deals if you buy from a reputable seller. the only downside might be the shipping time, depending on where you live and where they ship from.

cc198e7f4ab424c24743237d7bdb642aaa	The hospital my wife works at will not allow tattoos to be visible.  Piercings that aren't ears aren't allowed either. Neither is the hole from the piercing.   If clothes won't cover them, you have to wear a bandage/bandaid over them.  I've seen some pretty stupid looking bandaids, especially on noses.  I don't think they can not hire you because of it, but you're sure gonna love wearing a neckbrace at work every day. lol...  I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time right???|`|tao83sDxaa	i think your right, if you had to do it all over again, would you have done it. i'm a volunteer out a a hospital near us, thinking about the hair being up, i think you are right. i think you need to ask questions where ever you go. maybe if you work as a drs nurse it would be ok. good luck.|`|HOdblqIkaa	I don't know if you would be required to wear your hair up at all times but it seems most likely so you would probably have to cover your tattoo depending on the policey where you work. Some places don't mind something small and non offensive being visible while other places say nothing can be seen and then there are some hopsitals who don't mind anything visible. When you go for an interview ask about their piercing and tattoo policies and assuming they don't like them but you are hired just cover it with make up and a necklace if you can.|`|q9BItD25aa	Yes, but they don't look professional. There was a nurse at the nursing home loaded with tattoos ( spiders, skulls) who freaked the dementia patients out..........needless to say they couldn't have her on the floor.<br>  Also piercings are frowned upon, as in nursing school they will tell you no dangley earrings, no jewelry, and no long fingernails.<br>  You may have to wear your hair up...all depends on the school. After , when you apply for a job you want to look as neat and professional as possible. No wild hair dos, no black or crazy fingernail polish etc. Once you get to school you will understand what they want. Good luck to you.|`|La9bMNQqaa	If you want to become a nurse, it probably isn't the best idea to get a tattoo there. Think about another place you might like one that is easier to cover up. I'm sure you could still get hired somewhere if you got it, but your opportunities could be limited because of it and you don't want that.|`|igObHHIdaa	Yeah, of course. nurses can have tattoos<br>  <br>  But think about it. If you had to go to the hospital do you really want your nurse to have tattoos?|`|jp9OzuXoaa	Ohh yeah, for sure. My aunt is a nurse and she has at LEAST 10 of them. She has one larger one on her forearm and one behind her ear plus a lot of other ones that aren't visible.|`|9p24vIhfaa	SOME HOSPITALS I GO TO NURSES HAVE TATTOOS THATS UNCOVERED.

op5tbx0naa	something to remember as a red head, is that your complexion is that of a red head too. our complexion just does not go well with other hair  colors. i am a red head myself, and i went through a stage of dying my hair every other color in the book. when i look back on pictures now, im disturbed with how awkward i looked. the eyebrow issue isn't to big. i keep my hair red now, but i just pencil my eyebrows. learn how to do that well though. you don't want to look like a drag queen.|`|Xd4kN469aa	im a guy that likes red hair not bright red but like a little dark i like brown to an most  guys do i think you should dye it brown|`|pc5bVjffaa	you can dye your eyer brows brown too|`|7RUqEJzLaa	You should put some deep thought into this because red hair is really nice. If you are sure then I will tell you my friend dyed her red hair brown and it looks really nice. And you can dye your eyebrows the brown color so it matches. If you are dying your hair from a box make sure you do a strand test first. This is important because if you don't like it, or it doesn't turn out the way you wanted it to then it's only a strand of hair, not your whole head. If you're going to a salon then it's all good.|`|8D5trv2Oaa	Maybe just have brown streaks?
wyk12aeeaa	Agent Provocateur, Cosabella, and La Perla are a few of my favorite lingerie brands - they're so sexy and beautifully made. I love Marc by Marc Jacobs bags, Christian Louboutin heels. For sunglasses, I like Oliver Peoples and Ray Bans. Favorite cosmetic brands? Nars, Chanel, Dior, Benefit, Clinique, Laura Mercier, Shu Uemura, Stila, Tarte, and MAC. I usually get my makeup at Sephora. Favorite designers for party clothing? Marchesa, Alice+Olivia, Calvin Klein, Elizabeth and James, YSL, and way more. I dress in what I feel confident in ... my personal style is a mix of edgy, feminine, glamorous, and bohemian. I dress according to my mood that day, so my style is changing constantly. I don't like to be matchy, I think it's boring and generic. What I'm wearing directly affects my mood and behaviors. If I don't like what I'm wearing, then I tend to be in a pissy mood and I feel unconfident in myself. I don't care if I'm wearing a certain brand or not, I buy what I like and that's it. I won't spend tons on most of the things I own- especially trendy items that are bound to go out of style in a few months. I love to dress up in gorgeous dresses, heels, makeup, hair - it makes me feel pretty and fun. I don't like when people buy something just because it's in style or because it's a certain brand when it doesn't even look good on them. Trends aren't for everyone .. I mean, mini skirts just don't look that great on women with scrawny or huge legs. My favorite perfume is a tie between two- Vera Wang Princess (a vanilla floral and guava blend) and Burberry Brit which smells citrus and refreshes me.|`|uk7N5Yq9aa	Shoes- Anything<br>  Purses- Dooney and Bourke/Target<br>  Clothes- Goodwill, Aeropostal, Ebay, Macy's, Target<br>  Make-Up - Sheer Cover<br>  Sunglasses- Alloy<br>  Victoria Secret for Undergarments.|`|BJV8XfbPaa	I do not think there is more than ideal choice, I also believe that God is right<br>  <a href="http://www.51jordan.com/product.asp?id=573&cataid=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.51jordan.com/product.asp?id=5...</a>|`|FFmeZkXHaa	I suggest you visit this website: <a href="http://buy.maimaij.com." rel="nofollow">http://buy.maimaij.com.</a> there are so many products including sexy shoes, lingeries,fashion jewelry and wigs.|`|AA11626101	I get my stuff from a tranny's closet.

fYKqp9Fvaa	i actually wear a size 6 1/2 and for prom i got these heels that everyone commented on.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.undergroundstation.com/catalog_detail.aspx?id=35834" rel="nofollow">http://www.undergroundstation.com/catalo...</a>|`|uUlKhoLcaa	You must check out www.zappos.com. They have a huge selection. I did a test for you and narrowed it down to dress shoes, size 5.5, and silver and got three long pages of results. But the best part of the website is that it has free shipping BOTH ways. I would recommend picking two different shoes and seeing which one is more comfortable, or picking the shoe you like but in two different sizes. Some of the items even have user ratings which provide helpful information like "runs small" or "true to size" as well as reviews. I used this site for getting my high heels when I got married. I tried a few pairs, kept my favorite and sent back the others at no cost to me, no questions asked.|`|1c7008b0fde65fee3c98dddd7e10c9d2aa	here are some stores<br>  spring: <a

T93PeFvFaa	I would class somebody as "cool" if they had there OWN style ?<br>  I love to see someobdy wearing something unique and standing out of the crowd x<br>  Been confident in what they wear ?|`|JzyE6KUMaa	yeah, it depends on the group you hangout with.  Like if you chill with the emos, the tighter the jeans the cooler you are ( but they just look like feiggits).  But most people that are popular at my school tend to just wear regular sorta baggy jeans, a normal t-shirt, and a hoodie jacket.|`|0VVevBhBaa	Skinny jeans, hoodies, Converse, tight shirts, pastel skinnny jeans anything like that.|`|qeF8AN7Jaa	People who are noticeable. Wearing hoodies isn't cool to me, that's boring...|`|boY7017Daa	where what u like don't try to be "cool" ugh ppl be who u r not who ppl want u to be.|`|ul9FKrj1aa	That is going to vary from person to person, when really the only person who matters is you. Dont worry about what is cool or not, if you feel good about yourself--other people will take note.|`|YUHjbo54aa	Depends on which type of person you are but anything modern will be seen as cool by some.<br>  <br>  Jack.|`|QAEQqgzyaa	What ever your into and is your own style is cool. The only thing I don't think is cool is when people try and copy other people to fit in because they aren't being true to themselves then and what they really like. If you like high heels and classy dresses that's cool but if your into cute hoodies and funky shoes that's cool as well as far as im concerned. I wear all sorts of different things I don't stick to one style.|`|M6PsYn56aa	If your a boy judging by your aviator wear a nike hoodie/jacket.. helly hanson coat, timbaland jacket, addidas hoodie or mcenzie.. anythign in JD or JJB and get nike black trainers and nike/lacoste trainers.. thats whats called cool everywhere tbh|`|W6wamWLLaa	Preppy probably <br>  depends what type of school you go to|`|9wVHwBkCaa	i really like hilary duff's style
bxlYleZkaa	Any good tattooist studio will have loads of tribal stuff. Have a look on their walls and in the books of flash and you will see several that you like!
Yeq13X8iaa	Brushes, and watch this video why, it helped me a lot ! Says something about a spray, but I'll still stick to brushes since they're inexpensive, well, at drugstore places of course . <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y9z0mRrcvE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y9z0mRrc...</a><br>  <br>  I'm currently am using the Sonia Kashuk foundation frush in medium . I think it's medium size . . .<br>  about 10 bucks, go get it (: I'm going to get Essence of Beauty or Eco-Tools Foundation brush, since it's eco friendly and much cheaper !|`|2l4pDvwwaa	Professionals use an airbrush type of tool but that is not really practical for the average woman. Sponges give the smoothest result. Burshes obviously for applying a powder-type foundation or for using powder to set a liquid foundation.|`|8MMW8tMKaa	brushes are the best way to apply on foundation. you didnt specify what type of foundation, but either way brushes are the way to go. <br>  it also works best if you clean your brushes at least every other week. <br>  hope that helps!|`|jL0Y27g2aa	sponges|`|5kYIteIHaa	sponges and brushes.|`|xwsS0ITJaa	Putty knife.|`|HyxRTdjdaa	brush. because sponges can get rid of ur foundation quickly so they wont last long and ud have to buy it frequently plus they matt ur face so u could get big pores and fingers cud get dirt in ur skiin so thats not good either. so i use brush so i just brush over the foundation lightly on my skin!|`|578ed1731c2aa943b2af6d8e21fe78f8aa	Finger tips..you can massage the foundation onto your skin, so it has a much more natural finish.|`|zO0CFFvCaa	I use brushes and they work really well. But you have to tap the excess foundation off first. Good Luck!|`|29w9pQYwaa	a cement truck.

Softens hair and keeps natural oils in and doesn't burn your hair or spit your ends. It also curls your hair! Very good choice!<br>  <br>  Remington Wet2Straight- I own it. It works great! They sell it at target. It's only about $20. It has settings 1-30. 1-10 is used for dry hair, 10-20 is used for damp hair, and 20-30 is used for wet hair. It is safe to use on wet hair! I personally always have it set to 30.<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|UxBOpbk4aa	walmart.

tckI1g3Naa	if your hair is as damaged as you say it is, you need to work on not using that flat iron. try going curly for a good long while with sun silk's curl gel. it's in a green bottle that you can see the spiraled gel through. <br>  <br>  no hair style will look good with damaged hair. if you absolutely need to have it straight, then use a product like bio silk and try a blow dryer instead of a flat iron.<br>  <br>  the reason you aren't getting the nice waves you want might be because of the damage you've done. but some hair types just don't work with that method so you may never get that to work.

pD6K1rLkaa	yes, everyone has their own definition of what they find beautiful, and sometimes it isn't the looks at all, but what is inside that attracts someone =)|`|c26Ae2y1aa	I really don't care about or pay attention to looks (or my own)--funny, girls are supposedly the most critical of both sexes. When I am looking at someone's outward appearance, I do see beauty. I'm the kind of person that finds flaws interesting. Due to the fact that everyone has flaws, I find outward beauty in everyone. In terms of everyone else, a person automatically knows if another is attractive to them or not. It's a matter of preference. That really does make the idea of beauty different to everyone. I'm just weird, and assume there is beauty in everyone, inside and out...|`|nr0nzuXmaa	There's this girl in our school, and my friend thinks shes really pretty. I think she's just normal looking. But, she's had like, 4 boyfriends in 3 months and guys are all over her. I think it just matters to each individuals because everyone has a different view of what is beautiful.|`|6xmIPYimaa	it is totally true. everyone has different tastes :)|`|dizGH9qwaa	You are absolutely right, we are all attracted by different people, and its a good job too.<br>  We are influenced in our choices by peer pressure and popular culture in general terms, but individually each of us will be attracted differently.<br>  If you find your girl friend beautiful then anybody else's opinion doesn't matter, after all she may think the same about you!|`|AA11241715	My wife must need corrective eyesight surgery.|`|xc6iCPUQaa	Yes definitely!!|`|MbFS6XFQaa	It's totally true. I usually end up liking the "ugly" guys at school ,but to me they are the most drop dead gorgeous people I've ever seen

tqYpkDyEaa	Mascara is a beauty product you should think about investing in.  A good mascara may cost a high amount of money, but that usually means that it leaves your lashes long and clump free.<br>  <br>  Here are some that you can try out:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P40404&categoryId=S10510&shouldPaginate=true" rel="nofollow">http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P228204&categoryId=S10510&shouldPaginate=true" rel="nofollow">http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P204722&categoryId=C18893" rel="nofollow">http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...</a><br>  <br>  I'd go with either the first one, Dior Diorshow Blackout, or the third one.  I personally recommend the third one, Kevyn Aucoin's "The Volume Mascara".  From personal experience:  This mascara makes my eyelashes long and thick, and really makes my eyes pop.  One of the best features of it is that you don't have to worry about it smearing.  And, when you want the mascara to be gone, you just simply wet your fingers and lightly pull at your lashes, and it's gone!  This is because the mascara contains little tubes that secure your lashes.  It's really a great mascara.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!  [=|`|zZMCxNfwaa	Max factor false lash effect is AMAZING, the best mascara i have used in a while, i have used doir doirwshoe black out before and personally not the best mascara, its worth trying the max factor one i didnt think it was going to work but it does and i love it|`|MFUfXB9Caa	My favourites are L'oreal Telescopic and Rimmel Sexy Curves. They're both good mascars if you want to add lenght to your lashes.<br>  Also, you should throw out your mascaras after 3 months because of the bacteria that gets into them from the wand.|`|1HyxHtquaa	Before i even read your description i was going to suggest Diorshow. It works so well and i dont even need to use an eyelash curler anymore it adds amazing volume and curls perfectly! its worth it|`|Tpnx44dnaa	i use lashblast and it works fine for me. it looks natural- idk if thats the look your going for or not.|`|l53zZ0eVaa	I use MAX and Mabeleine  those work freakin good!! lol|`|cK6G9ilBaa	lashblast!|`|akbvn3uMaa	kk, it's funny because I have both Dior and Lashblast.<br>  <br>  I love Dior, but after a while it starts to clump, but it's great if you need thicker lashes.<br>  <br>  For Lashblast (cg) I use this currently. It will leave itty-bitty clumps on your lashes sometimes, and I only put it on the top, not the bottom. Sometimes if you put too much, it can be over-whelming.<br>  <br>  By far, the best mascara I've tried is Maybelline Great Lash, in the pink and green container. Never clumps, and makes it so that they look like you have incredibly long, thick (but natrual) lashes!|`|OlIGqmMNaa	I heard Dior show works, so you could get that one. What do you want from a mascara? If you are looking for length I really Highly suggest Loreal Telescopic, it adds so much length and seperation. If you are looking for thickness I suggest Maybelline Colossal. (In a yellow tube)<br>  <a href="http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Eye/Mascara/the-colossal-volum-express.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Eye/Ma...</a><br>  OR Maybelline Lash stiletto also adds length:<br>  <a href="http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Eye/Mascara/lash-stiletto-ultimate-length-mascara.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Eye/Ma...</a>|`|s5y6SZhnaa	My favorite is L'oreal telescopic carbon black.<br>  <br>  this is only a good mascara if you have naturally long lashes, if not, i would go with Neutrogena healthy volume. Don't be fooled by designer mascara, its no better than classic drugstore magic. Never wear brown mascara, it doesn't look 'more natural' as it is described. it only makes your lashes look cakey in the light. The reason i like carbon black is because it looks black in even the brightest light.|`|HyxRTdjdaa	AHHHHH THE LANCOME ONE!! its sooooo goood it like gets each eyelash and makes it look long! i love it! i used to wear maybelline and it worked goood too but sometimes it doesnt work for certain people. so i wouldnt know the if the lancome would work good but it does for me!|`|V2F8YCa2aa	I use Cover Girl Lash Exact. I love it! It's not all clumpy or anything...|`|Yeq13X8iaa	I like Rimmel Lash Maxx mascara, it has a comb and it's amazing for volume and giving that fake lash look (: It seperates your lashes and no clumps ! I borrow my friend's a lot and soon to buy my own :D<br>  <a href="http://www.rimmellondon.com/US/products/eyes/product.aspx?id=278" rel="nofollow">http://www.rimmellondon.com/US/products/...</a><br>  <br>  Another one I like is Lo'real Voluminous, I heard it is said to be compared to Covergirl lash blast . Whatever, I like it a lot (: <br>  <a href="http://www.lorealparisusa.com/_us/_en/default.aspx?#page=top{nav|media:_blank|overlay:productdetail//objectid+Cos36c_1//|diagnostic|main:beautyfilter//category+F1_Cosmetics_Eyes_Mascara;pageNum+2//|userdata//d+d//}" rel="nofollow">http://www.lorealparisusa.com/_us/_en/de...</a><br>  <br>  The both of them are about 6 to 10 dollars . I'm sure the Rimmel is around that price since it's drugstore brand .<br>  <br>  <br>  Now for higher brand mascaras, the best two I've tried is Lancome Definicils (: It defines your lashes a lot, and no clumps, it's really good (: I think it's like around 20 to 30 bucks, I forget . I used it in black .<br>   <a href="http://www.lancome-usa.com/makeup/mascara/definicils-mascara.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lancome-usa.com/makeup/mascar...</a><br>  <br>  The other one is HR (Helena Rubinstein) Mascara . My cousin got it for me, and the mascara container is sooooo pretty ^-^ My cousin gave it to me in Black Brown =]<br>  <a href="http://www.helenarubinstein.com/_int/_en/catalog/product.aspx?prdcode=28919000&CategoryCode=AXE_Makeup^F1_Mascara&" rel="nofollow">http://www.helenarubinstein.com/_int/_en...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  If you want it hold your curls the best, get them in waterproof ! I think they all come in a waterproof formula . Hope this helps (:
sm7DJGOoaa	i like the first one and the last one, the middle one might make you look akward/manly. <br>  <br>  i am fond of the first one. get the right accessories and make it look spring-time-bubbly.<br>  <br>  (:|`|V6tPaXzxaa	I think you'd look best in the white one of the black and white one. the blue dress isn't that great...I looove the white one though, very cute and fun.|`|Z1NlYGExaa	I love the blue one, but definitely not the white because it will wash you out.  that black is pretty too.  But, do you want color of not?|`|C8Hym9akaa	I don't like the flowers on the first. <br>  And the second is kinda plain.<br>  but I love the third! it's very pretty! Especially the color|`|6uYVRaebaa	the last one would go great with your gorgeous eyes! just leave your hair down its so pretty...i have lame short hair :P i don't see why people with long pretty hair put it up during prom...hope i helped :)|`|206dd2e69c3974014fb06b5019b94bc4aa	Definitely the second one...the first one is a little tacky with the sash and sequins.  I just do not like the third one.|`|ER65lLYgaa	People in short prom dresses look stupid, go with one of the last two! They're both really pretty|`|HOf4JMcYaa	i LOVE the first one!! it would look amazing on you|`|xPsTZkgpaa	well if its your senior prom,<br>  id go with #2<br>  the first is cute, but i dont thinks its dressy enough<br>  and the powder blue, is never a good choice for brown hair, trust me :)|`|1c7008b0fde65fee3c98dddd7e10c9d2aa	the first one is cute, but prom is more formal than a fancy cocktail dress<br>  i would say the turquoise one, maybe with a few black bangles<br>  <br>  whichever you pick, good luck with your prom =)|`|QMYNU9uNaa	I think the first one is the prettiest! I think it would look really great on you too. Since you're tall it will show off your legs and will show off your athletic body type. I think the color would look really good with your hair and skin tone and would make you look amazing, have fun!|`|MSzjOOOjaa	the first one is gorgeous i think it will look great on you!|`|7wlgFBacaa	The third one, definitly. It is gorgeos, more unique, and it would look good on you. The first one doesn't look enough like a prom dress, and the second one is boring, no color, and it looks too old for prom. =P|`|N5MjOIXsaa	I don't think any of them would really work for you, if I had to choose one for you it would hte the third.|`|2S2onP86aa	I like the first one - blue with purple - short. It's really cute. <br>  <br>  You're cute too.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|578ed1731c2aa943b2af6d8e21fe78f8aa	The black & white one, it has a sophisticated look about it.
NaLxNQhCaa	Mine's sometimes does. I have an oily scalp so it's common to wake up with smelly hair even if I wash it the night before. During sleep our body functions in restoration processes, sweats, etc. so it's normal for a lot of people.|`|C0qL6tgCaa	I don't know 'cause my nose doesnt reach all the way up to my scalp for me to sniff it :(<br>  <br>  But no, my head/scalp doesn't smell bad, it smells like my shampoo or products I put on it :)
NqWl2qlPaa	I have never had any effects on my hair, but as for clearing up skin problems, they do work well for that.  As far as your age, just don't over do it.  Maybe once a week or twice a week 8 minutes at a time.  Make sure your parents are ok with it too.|`|WxNrWyeAaa	no, that will be fine. just dont go too often.dont start going a couple times a week but once or twice a month is okaay.<br>  <br>  i have no idea about the hair, i wouldnt think so though...
OJWApbmbaa	You can get clothes like those at forever21 or express, shoes heels always make a good outfit or boots.|`|sm7DJGOoaa	forever21, charlote russ.<br>  <br>  the website link you have, there dresses are cheap. why don't you buy from there?<br>  <br>  hope i helped.<br>  <br>  <br>  (:
uKdEr8x4aa	Oh, please! Seriously you got designer shoes for really cheap and if you like them then keep them but if you don't like them then don't keep them. Designer things are really noticed and you will get a lot of compliments if you wear them.|`|QMYNU9uNaa	No, that's a really good price for Coach shoes! I spent $50 on my Coach shoes when they were on sale at Macy's and would never think about returning them. Anyways, most shoes cost around that much anyways. I can understand the guilt if you spent $100 on them but if you like them I think you should keep them, its good to treat yourself every once and a while =)|`|YQxxVdLNaa	That's really cheap for Coach. Are you sure they aren't rip-offs? I once bought a pair of skater shoes for $50 and didn't give the price a second thought.|`|mccN6lCjaa	They were forty bucks thats incredible people buy them for like 120 or even 200 odont return it. Dont feel giulty.|`|yIYEmkZyaa	no, burn them as you deserve to be punished|`|hPDQGtdJaa	no and 40 bucks on coach shoes really isnt much|`|LZtsKaT2aa	dont feel guilty. coach shoes are usually around like $100. you got a deal.|`|C8Hym9akaa	no, just be sure to get a lot of use out of them!<br>  Like if you wear them 10 times, it's only about four bucks per time. <br>  Or if you wear em 20 times its only like two bucks :)<br>  I hope I helped ya :)|`|tYgxvtFHaa	Coach shoes are expensive,  I mean if you really like the shoes, then you get them. I dont think yoiu have a shoe fetish like my mother.....|`|V6tPaXzxaa	40.00 isn't that much for shoes...however that sounds cheap for a Coach product and I wouldn't wear their shoes....|`|HOf4JMcYaa	Thats fu**ing CHEAP for coach shoes!<br>  DO NOT return them!!|`|ZKKLj6wZaa	No. I spend more than that on shoes if they are worth it. You buy a pair of Docs, you will have them for life.|`|c7M1IbZ0aa	hmmmm r u goin to a special occasion>>? them keep em...if u r buying them just to buy them then please just take them back!
XaYHMNusaa	It could cause your navel piercing to migrate, I guess.|`|AA12306087	I got my belly button pierced in 7th grade.. so 12 or 13 I guess?  I'm 22 now and it still looks like it did when I first got it.  I got mine done in Canada, they wouldn't even do it in my hometown that young, and it's fine!  I got a barbell in it when I first got it pierced and I lost one of the balls so I went to the tattoo shop in my town and I literally got REAMED for having a barbell in at my age because of the growing issue, but I'm here to tell you from experience it'll be FINE.|`|jp9OzuXoaa	No, you're fine :)
juWJ47hXaa	As far as getting girls is concerned, personality is the most important. Growing up, I tried my hair at various lengths, and it did not improve my ability to attract women, so I imagine the same would go for your facial hair.|`|FHQZz8dNaa	Try waxing your facial hair, with wax and some carmel like substance, I used it on my legs and they were nice for like a month. It could work on your face. AND NO THE REASON ISN'T CUZ U HARRY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A GIRL, LOL!!<br>  JUST BE THE KIND OLD YOU AND YOULL HAVE EM COMING LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|nGu0sUJaaa	I had the same problem dont shave everyday or every couple of days ! SO what if you have stuble its your body you should not care what ppl think about you  i shave every 4 days now my skin so good so go for it|`|Y4ZjGCr4aa	stop shaving and just grow your hair. If it takes a long time just take a cap to cover your head. And put some hair gel when your hair does grow|`|h7CvumEmaa	just dont shave it.  just keep it trimmed very short.  i like guys with facial hair.  so im sure there must be some other girls out there who like it.

I 'm currently growing out my hair, I miss it. ):<br>  I think, since your hair is curly, you should leave it curly, put some spray in it, and maybe get your bangs done, OR, put them to the side with a bobby pin, like you 're doing, it sounds so pretty.<br>  Or, to a messy pony tail, with pieces hanging out of it, curly.<br>  That 'd be verrrry pretty. As for the frizzyness, maybe get some stuff to calm it down? :]<br>  <br>  i 'm jealous, i wish I had hair again. :(<3

Just wear your hair straight and natural!<br>  <br>  have fun!<br>  |`|IRq5hlxCaa	If you have any jewelry that is neon green or yellow that would work. There is also a site called polyvore where you can take a polo and find things that match it.|`|lpV0AD5yaa	striped cami, black vest, grey flats<br>  scrunched hair
3UVPe2xraa	no, it is all in the skin genetics. the hair color doesnt have much to do with it, although people born with red hair normally are born with a gene that makes it where the burn, not tan, and they normally stay very pale.|`|OlIGqmMNaa	Haircolor doesn't affect it. Its the color of the skin. If you are really pale, it is harder to tan, because you can become a lobster really easily (like me). If you are really dark skinned, even if you do tan, it's not necessarily visible. Its easiest for people who have like a medium skin tone.|`|47MEqvsPaa	go tanning ima blonde and i go tanning at sun city it works hahah|`|1d5dd8de2008c59f27a78e062fcc7db6aa	Hair color doesn't necessarily have anything to do with how well you tan... its your skin tone and genes
cdb9e0af6b46d36a188fb41a3cd9e16daa	I think at 16 years old with a parent|`|HyxRTdjdaa	mmmm maybe 15?|`|lgMZJQtwaa	heey<br>  dont even go tanning<br>  all it does is tell ppl your a fake and give you cancer|`|zLMaJxVoaa	I am not 100% sure, but i am pretty sure you can go any age with a parent, and 16 alone. You can always call and ask! xoxo
SrRJNzJOaa	Very nice :)<br>  You have a good combination sense. I think its perfectly fine to go rollerskating with it, I went ice skating with a simeler outfit. <br>  I would combine it with maybe a pink necklace, or silver. silver bracelets would be good. Oh and not pink necklance and silver bracelet cause it would clash. Good luck!|`|ArOGaaeZaa	i thinks that good but dont do turqoise of EVERYTHING...i think u should get the light or dark blue sweetshirt and a grey tangtop...ull look hot|`|jL0Y27g2aa	its nothing special, its typical tween although you are like 11 or 12.. anyways i guess its fine its not exactly stylish and unique and i would pair it woth a brown belt|`|mgeuli7Naa	It's cute. I would get a long beaded necklace to go with it. Maybe in a different color of blue.|`|ST021KISaa	i think the outfit is cute. you should wear a beaded necklace or a heart chain necklace|`|KFwXBXv7aa	its cute|`|IEQtnSbyaa	yeh it looks cute and i know im a girl but i reckon the boys at the party will think the same|`|jo7n4Olaaa	I think you should go with skinny jeans. That will look better. Layer some long gold toned necklaces with the hoodie. Have fun:) -Ellie|`|oYmZUO8Caa	That's a good outfit :o) have fun!|`|d21b8a886cea9e7687d2a1f509f75f80aa	it looks rather plain!|`|GuxPC1Kyaa	Ummm...<br>  I only like the tank (especially in grey or blue). I hate, I truly hate bootcut jeans eww. But maybe they're good for rollerskating I don't know.<br>  The hoodie is OK, but it's a fleece hoodie and it's an Abercombie hoodie, so here's what I would choose:<br>  <a href="http://shop.pacsun.com/girls/jeans/hermosa-super-skinny/index.cat" rel="nofollow">http://shop.pacsun.com/girls/jeans/hermo...</a> - rinsed indigo/marine blue/black/grey - you get 2 pairs for the price of one.<br>  If you want a turqoise hoodie, I'd choose this one... It's also from Pacsun so you'll get free shipping plus a 25$ card<br>  <a href="http://shop.pacsun.com/sale/girls-hoodies/Genius-Blue-Hoodie/index.pro" rel="nofollow">http://shop.pacsun.com/sale/girls-hoodie...</a><br>  And the tank (Grey/white/royal I guess and yeah it's 97% cotton not 60%)<br>  <a href="http://shop.pacsun.com/girls/tanks/Ribbed-Boyfriend-Tank/index.pro" rel="nofollow">http://shop.pacsun.com/girls/tanks/Ribbe...</a><br>  If you want the turqoise hoodie, I think it would look really good with grey/indigo jeans, if you want a different hoodie, like this one (it also has a bit of turqoise) <a href="http://shop.pacsun.com/sale/girls-hoodies/One-Only-Black-Foil-Hoodie/index.pro" rel="nofollow">http://shop.pacsun.com/sale/girls-hoodie...</a> this would look really hot with the marine blue jeans.<br>  Other than that, I really love this lime/fern green color on girls.<br>  This is just me, though. <br>  <br>  The most important thing: be yourself. If YOU like the clothes you chose, forget what I just wrote and buy what you want. Seriously, trying to be someone who you're not is just not the way to go. Once again, buy what YOU like
4ThRaoBOaa	No,<br>  in california they don't have hollister in the mall and you are considered a freak/ nerd if you wear it!|`|ZjpVlm9Gaa	no. My friend gave me a gift card to there over a year ago and I still didn't use it.|`|J1kJb98Maa	no|`|ICTqyQaraa	i have 2 comments<br>  1.hollister is nothing (price-wise) compared to real brand name designers. everyone says that all the teens wear it. most teens are middle class so how would they have their closets filled with HCO? use logic its not that expensive if you shop clearance<br>  2. not everything has HOLLISTER across the front. the girl employees that i work with know how to layer and match knits,tanks, etc to make a pretty awesome outfit. <br>  <br>  haters are essentially hypocrites. you say to be a individual and be unique so why would you care about what others wear? take your own advice and worry about yourself|`|FCoDzdHeaa	not really. i like hollister's jeans. Pacsun is pretty cool. <br>  but i mostly shop at forever 21.|`|LSkeAPBIaa	Hollister has some really nice knits, bags and coats. I got my coat from there. Pacsun has nice sweatshirts but it is more of a skater store|`|af533b17ca68713705564cacfb86ba98aa	No, not everyone likes Hollister.|`|IRG03siXaa	Nope. I don't like it. It's not that I can't afford it, but everyone wears it and if I buy it im just like them. I wanna look different. Not the same.<br>  <br>  Besides your just paying for the name Hollister.<br>  <br>  There sweaters suck, but people buy it because it's name brand, they feel like they have alot of money and because its in.|`|QBWiPLVnaa	Hollister isn't the best store to shop for clothes.<br>  But the clothes that they have, are pretty stylish/nice.<br>  But, I would perfer clothes from, Forever 21, Urban Behaviour, etc.|`|tcUADMWFaa	i try to stay away from hollister because everyone wears it. Some kids in my school sometimes show up in the same shirt. I choose my clothes depending on comfort and some style.|`|Q0Ky6DeLaa	I hate Hollister.<br>  Pac Sun is really nice. I like it a lot.<br>  I shop at Delias and Forever21 and Heritage and places like that.|`|TaFrxxJXaa	no i hate hollister<br>  <br>  I wish everyone would stop conforming :(|`|2S2onP86aa	I like Hollister and American Eagle. Yes.|`|D5FZweUeaa	wth missy k..<br>  i live in cali and like 90% of the kids there wear hollister<br>  even the ghetto people lol.<br>  <br>  not me though.<br>  rofl i get my clothes online o__O|`|lvzZA7ubaa	I don't like hollister i think it is over priced and almost everything is the same but a different color. Pac Sun is cool. i go there all the time.|`|P21RQ8xpaa	well i like hollister but i dont go there often. if you went to my school, you wouldnt have to worry about who likes it or not because thats all every girl at my school wears!!!!|`|XCX8w4LMaa	i love hollister and pacsun. i also love aeropostale and american eagle.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!=]|`|LKZffm2saa	I only like pacsuns jeans, besides that I shop at tillys and forever 21. <br>  hollister is expensive and pointless|`|r3PgrJhDaa	I like Hollister, I just wish it wasn't so pricey. I love pacsun! yet again, I just wish it wasn't so pricey. haha.|`|iQLYRzRUaa	Hollister- overpriced, slutty and i hate it<br>  <br>  Pac Sun- my favorite store|`|AjFC8mEFaa	i don't think so. i've never shopped there. so not everyone likes it.|`|ZTs2tFHFaa	everybody wear's Hollister now-a-day's it kinda got played out.<br>  but they have some pretty cute stuff.|`|AA11418152	everyone at my school does..cuz it is the bomb|`|mLuz6QzGaa	I'm wearing Hollister right now and i like guys who wear Hollister|`|Xwtf4iqjaa	i used to like hollister..<br>  but i dont like it as much nemore<br>  cuz their style is kinda slutty|`|tYgxvtFHaa	Not really....<br>  <br>  I mean its ok, but i like going to Urban Outfitters! they have the cutest things ever!!|`|OoLJQNYwaa	no i like American eagle better|`|gzMZRbmIaa	Not even close|`|jrmvEmEKaa	No. I don't, its to pricey and more like the band wagon for trendy brain dead preps.   And they have boring styles.|`|niYixDU4aa	no....only the trend following idiots.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  did i help?  :D|`|kGGvDIjYaa	who couldn't love hollister or pacsun. they are like cool.|`|cZJpf4xzaa	yeah, i mean who doesn't like those? they are so cool. i also like aeropastale.
Yeq13X8iaa	My mom told me yes, because the ingredients in Anti Wrinkle/Anti Aging cremes has chemicals that can harm your skin and can premature even faster . My mom always make sure I don't get Anti Aging sht, so that my skin doesn't look like an old person's skin when I grow up !<br>  <br>  Don't try it, just to be on the safe side (:|`|HyxRTdjdaa	actually, its good because think of it, it reduces wrinkles for old women so they wont have more wrinkles forming but if u use it when ur young, u could prolly maintain that young skin for long.|`|o9VKZKpQaa	no anti-wrinkle!<br>  try nivea care face lotion or something,<br>  it's better to be on the safe side even if you don't know if it's true.|`|l53zZ0eVaa	yes!!!! That just causes wrinkles to form slowly and you will start developing them around 32-40yrs. of age!<br>  <br>  Stop using it.... just stick to acne remover. it works just the same but it just doesnt form wrinkles when ur older....|`|MFUfXB9Caa	No it isn't bad because none of them work anyway.
iBpw0ixHaa	I think you look good both ways. but darker hair looks a little better and a little older...maybe a dark shade of blonde (since summer is coming) would work or maybe a lighter brown.<br>  Hope that helps some! Good luck =]|`|gZnDHz6Daa	i have never met someone who looks good with more then one hair color.<br>  you look so pretty with brown, and it brings out your face.<br>  and you look extremley pretty with blonde hair.<br>  and i was having the same problem as you- i missed my blonde hair haha.<br>  so i did brown underneath and blonde on top.<br>  it would look good on a pretty girl like you.<br>  but if not go back to blonde:)|`|Uubhpmxtaa	I like both ways but, honestly I like the brunette alot more. If you miss your blonde maybe just get blond highlights that way you can have your blonde but keep your brunette.|`|1d5dd8de2008c59f27a78e062fcc7db6aa	The coloring in the blonde pic is a little off but I think it looks good blonde...|`|7cGLSsF7aa	Hey<br>  I think you look good both ways <br>  but blonde looks better and suits you, <br>  love Your hair by the way<br>  I would go with blonde|`|BXNRttQbaa	blonde u look better blonde|`|7RUqEJzLaa	Well first off, both of the colors look very nice on you.  Even though I like both, I think the blonde just suits you a bit more. It may be damaging to your hair to go back though so it's a tough decision.|`|22rtv2fYaa	blonde|`|z02wVf3laa	i think that you should go back to blonde. dont get me wrong you look fine brunette but definitely better blonde.<br>  good luck.|`|coxEsXNTaa	OH MY GOD!!! i love love love your brown hair!!!!!!! you are so pretty too! trust me keep the brown because to be honest, the blonde on you makes you look a tad trampy but thats probably just the picture you gave. STAY BRUNETTE!|`|3UVPe2xraa	Love the blonde. Get it the same as it was then.|`|noUZuLV8aa	seriously ,  u look better as a brunette ..|`|2S2onP86aa	You are a very pretty girl - and I recommend you to keep this color, never go back blonde. This is much better and actually you look younger with dark hair. Honest!|`|6HP348pAaa	Your eyes are really pretty! :)<br>  But I like it better when it's brown. :)<br>  But it's your hair, just do whatever you want with it!<br>  :)|`|k2P7LkWgaa	i think you look better brunette-it looks more natural and pretty(:|`|8tLS1XDWaa	I like you both ways, but I think the blonde makes you look more mature..|`|tdvXAiXqaa	blonde and maybe get a pink streak in your hair that would be cute|`|niYixDU4aa	go back to blonde.<br>  <br>  i usually don't like blonde but you look better with it.|`|WGFtXo6Paa	No! You look so much better with dark hair.|`|8cttUra2aa	i think u should keep it brown but put in blond highlights
FCoDzdHeaa	lovvve skinny jeans! :D<br>  go with either simple flats or cute tennis shoes, i think. If you want to wear a sweater, I would wear a zip up sweater... maybe black to match your hobo bag? <br>  and wear a simple necklace and bracelet, like, maybe just silver. <br>  <br>  If you have bangs:<br>  wear your hair down and straight, if possible, with your bangs up, and a teased bump in your bangs. <br>  <br>  No bangs:<br>  Wear your hair naturally how it is, and down .<br>  hope i helpeddd :D|`|hWASYrgtaa	well you can keep the outfit simple by wearing black flats with black bracelets<br>  or you can spice it up with color accesories <br>  cuz every color goes with an outfit like that.<br>  <br>  so i suggest maybe pink ballet flats with a pink bracelet and as for your hair, i love the small "poof" with straight hair :)|`|H8Yo96jWaa	OOOHH !<br>  I have such great ideas !<br>  <br>  Shoes :<br>  Wear a tan, brown or black Ugg, Emu etc.<br>                             or<br>  A brown. black, or silver ballet flat<br>  <br>  Accessories : <br>  A bright red beaded necklace !<br>  Silver bangles<br>  A simple, cute earring <br>  <br>  Hair :<br>  Wear it really straight<br>              or<br>  Really curly<br>  <br>  Makeup :<br>  Black eyeliner<br>  Black mascara<br>  red or clear lip gloss<br>  No eyeshadow <br>  ( if you want, do a smokey eyeshadow )<br>  <br>  I hope this helps ! :)|`|5Up1iL3Saa	you could wear a black belt with maybe some gold or silver sandals with black earrings and a black necklace.|`|rh5vbol9aa	Perhaps the white one of "all*star"!|`|yIYEmkZyaa	have you nothing better to think about|`|er8pXBcJaa	I would wear a long necklace with it, and a big ring, statement jewelery is really in.  ANd for the shoes, it depends on what the weather is like i guess, if it's warm i would wear glasiator sandals, but if it's too cold then i would wear boots.  For your hair i would wear it wavy or curly.|`|xpeBsik0aa	black cardigan or jacket, flats and jewelry - you could do the shoes/jewelry in black or basically any other colour. Idk what your hair is like, but if it's long enough you could just curl it or do that beachy-waves-Blake Lively kind of thing.|`|uKdEr8x4aa	Colorful scarf or a long necklace and a ring. you could scrunch your hair and make it all fun and curly or you could straighten it and pull the top layer up and clip it. I think that i would go with some colorful flats or some cute little sneakers, nothing to fancy.|`|Z1NlYGExaa	Go for flats always with skinny jeans.  And for jewelry I'd keep it simple like a long beaded necklace, or one with a cluster on it.  And for your hair you might want to try a side pony tail with a headband, if you have short hair try putting a poof in the front like this.....<a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v24/fabrication/howtodothishair.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v24/fa...</a> (not me by the way)|`|V6tPaXzxaa	I always add color to any outfit to add some "pop" to the outfit! Like colorful shoes and a cute colorful clutch to go with it...or a long necklace to add to the shoes color.|`|tYgxvtFHaa	Spice it up with red. A red belt, red shoes, black and red earrings and white and red bracelets <br>  <br>  <br>  Red is a kool color!|`|UIF7OBuxaa	I'd say boots, with the jeans tucked in and bold jewlery with natural hair.|`|HOf4JMcYaa	maybe black high heels or flats<br>  straighten hair....<br>  and black or white jewlry|`|c7M1IbZ0aa	Go with the up doe or cute ponytail..its in for spring...get matches bracelets..you should wear hoops or diamond studs that would be cute....dont wear jacket(depending on weather) u can wear white flats to match ur top or black boots keep it simple nothing to flashy because ur jewlery will be enough..Yea keep the bag...Remember less is more.
Sd3kXRgGaa	Go to one of those spray-on tanning places and have them speckle your face. That will dye your skin for a little bit. I'm sure that could help.<br>  <br>  <br>  Welcome to my wet, damp and cloudy state! :)|`|f8bf26c17d2b021c337d130648b25311aa	I moved to New York from Florida and lost all mine too, then I started going tanning and they're back|`|WeOMih26aa	I think they form from exposure to sun. If you don't get all that much sun where you live, you could always try a tanning salon. I don't think going once is too dangerous, but I think it would give you your freckles back! Good luck|`|JhwnjTyCaa	if u have lightish skin and you tan or even go the beach just a few times in a short time period
Yeq13X8iaa	Awwww, hun, just be more confident and talk to people ! Start new conversations with peopl, don't be shy (: Show confident, cause people likes it when a person is confident and not afraid to show themselves . I know how you feel, but then I started talking to a lot of people, and now a lot of people knows me ! (not to sound cocky, but it's kinda true)<br>  <br>  Start a myspace page and add people then talk to them like, "Heyy, I see you in my class and I just want to know you better ." <br>  <br>  Or be like, "Hey remember me ?" Or something like that, myspace is a great way to start making friends ! I started off like that, so it should work for you too ! =] Or try facebook ! Yaaayyy for interent:]|`|6HP348pAaa	I can feel the same way too. I guess we both just have to put our selfs out there sometimes. I'm sure that someone will come along and notice you, us.

HOdblqIkaa	Check the type of metal the new bar is made of. Make sure its not nickel or silver but a higher grade metal. Make sure you are cleaning it properly. it sounds like an infection to me because I've never seen a red ring around a properly healing piercing before. If it hasn't gone away in a few days go back to your artist and have them take a look. If you don't need to take It out then buy your jewelry soley from a tattoo and piercing parlor, that way you know for sure you are buying quality jewelry.|`|tPFHLcisaa	Lol, you need to go see the person who did it. I don't think it's infected, sometimes you can get a puss build up (like when you get your ears pierce). It's hard to know without seeing it. Get them to check it out.
PaVyuYVUaa	shave with the grain. shave down with the hair. that way you won't get bumps.|`|AA11612508	i always get bumps and it always itches and ive been shaving for bout ten years now.<br>  <br>  I shave about every 3-4 days. before i shave a take exfoliator (make ur own with lots of sugar added to body wash) and exfoliate entire area first.<br>  then i use shave gel always nothing else.<br>  always use a good shaver. dont use an old one. <br>  <br>  then once i get out i just put some lotion on like i do with my legs.
aiAd7Uvjaa	a party store|`|HhXQnSznaa	Any party store in your area. We have a Party Time store and I think it's a chain so you might have one where you live.|`|U1IfJacYaa	You can pretty much buy them at any party supply store. You're talking about the little ones for drinks right?|`|FCoDzdHeaa	targetttt:)
3SfQs5SOaa	Wear jeans and a cute top. Just mascara is fine, and I think your weight is ok for the height if thats what youre asking. Straighten your hair or at least make it look clean and stuff. And then... maybe just have clear skin ;]<br>  Oh by the way you're 11 and that's your sister's friend so don't worry about it.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	11 years old and you are worried about looking pretty? unbelievable.|`|lFenXNCzaa	Wear the mascara with clear lip gloss and wear casual clothes with some jewelry. Oh and wear the best accessory a "smile".|`|emJ79qagaa	no, 102 i is better than being fat darling. Also foundation, powder can mess up your skin! When you put foreign chemicals or materials on your skin that are not supposed to be there, it can react very badly. I don't wear any foundation or powder, but, I wear eyeliner, eyeshadow, mascara (long lashes are one of my NATURAL best features) and a darkish or neutral lipstick. Just play up your good features. Have you seen people with makeup and how bad their skin can look when they take it off? Have you seen celebrities without makeup? If your skin is good, leave it alone! Don't put any funny stuff on it! If you have unique eyes play up the eyes, if you have pretty lips, play up your lips. But do not put foundation on or any other mineral or chemical makeup. The results are never good. But if you have any upper-lip hair or your eyebrows need shaping you can get them waxed, that will make a huge difference and you can look pretty without makeup and can make your face more unique and beautiful! Play up your eyes, lips, but no foundation or powder! I know it may seem bad because all the girls are doing it but they really hate their skin and they will be so jealous of your skin later on.|`|OJWApbmbaa	No that's not bad I think that's average for your age and height. to look good without makeup make sure you have a clear face and wash up everyday, brush your teeth, do your eyebrows if needed (they really do make all the difference), wear nice clothing and shoes.<br>  A lot of looking good my friend is Hygiene and if you have good Hygiene when shop for clothes you will look better vs someone who dresses up and has black teeth and smells bad.|`|LxHeXqjOaa	A cute tank top, with a hoodie with a zipper, and rip jeans.<br>  a longish necklace and flates, or any shoe.<br>  <a href="http://www.ae.com/web/browse/w_styleguide.jsp?catId=cat2570020" rel="nofollow">http://www.ae.com/web/browse/w_styleguid...</a><br>  <br>  make a bump in your hair, [duff do]. <br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v320/LilPucal0v3r/HAIR-long7049.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v320/L...</a>|`|rXInAcURaa	you said you were having a baby on your questions before, i dont think you can do that when your 11.<br>  :S|`|z0tk6XSvaa	make sure your hair looks nice i feel fine without make up when my hairs straightened<br>  curl your eyelashes<br>  try using Ardell lash growth accelator to make your eyelashes longer and thicker and its only 4 dollars<br>  and ofcourse wear mascara<br>  make sure your lips are moisturized<br>  and have clean, clear skin.<br>  and white teeth.<br>  and your weight and hight seem fine some guys like tall girls some like short.|`|k5S5OIH8aa	Woowww you're just the perfect weight for your age :3!!<br>  <br>  And you're friend shouldn't care if you're wearing make up or not.<br>  BUt you can just make your hair look nice..maybe just curl it up a bit..then but on a cute t-shirt and jeans :D|`|l6yn08LNaa	well hmmm wear jeans and a cute tank top and straighten your hair i bet you would look really cute.|`|LKZffm2saa	Wow, youre really skinyyy... lucky.

But it is really worth it!|`|La9bMNQqaa	I had mine done almost a year ago and it was very cute but it HURT. It didn't feel like a shot because your nose is thick and the needle has to tear through all that cartilage.  My eyes were watering really bad and it bled! But-I still think it was worth it and I've had it taken out now for about 2 months and it didn't leave a single mark when it healed.|`|SCZzsxvFaa	For me, not at all  =) & i luvv mine <3<br>  <br>  Easier than a shot, I believe.<br>  <br>  Look @ it dis way.. for one second u feel dat one-time sting, & u get a lifetime piecing u'r gonna love. <br>  <br>  Ur eyes do water but that's just ur body's natural reaction; u R after all puttin a hole in it.|`|baEv70bLaa	yes!<br>  if you're talking about the cartllige (or however you spell it)<br>  yeah it does but only for like a split second <br>  if you're talking about your septum then yes >.<<br>  that hurts|`|9PCA36xmaa	You would think so.
mF27xjFgaa	Jane Iredale is the best mineral makeup! I bought it from my dermatologist 2 years ago when I was having breakouts. My dermatologist said it was the best even though he was also offering many other mineral lines. My sister was also recommended to use the jane iredale line from her derm.<br>  <br>  The jane iredale slogan is "the skin care makeup"...imo bare essentials is terrible for oily skin. It looks like cake sitting on the top of your face. Since you have very oily skin I would pass on bare minerals foundation. Their mineral veil and blushes are nice though. I've had friends that loved everyday minerals at first and then ended up with breakouts (like myself) or couldnt really get a great color match.<br>  <br>  I've purchased both the pressed and lose foundation at 36-49$ a piece. I like them both, they both offer great build-able coverage. Great for hyper-pigmentation (brown marks) and active acne. The price makes sense considering Ive only purchased 3 times in the last 2 years. I even saw an article recently about the Jane Iredale line in Health magazine. Its one of the best mineral lines out there. My acne moment is over with now but I still love the makeup cuz its good for my skin...There are lots of mineral makeup lines but not all are 100% natural or the best for acne prone skin. janeiredale.com|`|YRRXtVXeaa	YES|`|gSt0cZ2jaa	bare minerals works wonders and really helps skin. it is pricey but its worth it and lasts all day|`|8MMW8tMKaa	i have the same problem as you, some mineral makeup do work good. the things you should try if you are just starting with makeup is everyday minerals. you can go buy some online at everydayminerals.com, but the hard part about that is choosing your perfect color. its about 4 dollars to sample it, and in the sample there is quite a bit. <br>  If you want to spend more money on your mineral powder, i suggest you try urban decay surreal skin mineral makeup, that stuff is awesome! <br>  if you feel like your face gets too oily when using one foundation, dont be scared to switch your foundation every week if you have too. I do it all the time and believe it or not, i dont have any acne! hope that helps!|`|MSlbS3Zzaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out a few different ones.The review site is pretty good at <a href="http://www.brandsmakeup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.brandsmakeup.com</a> visit and read the reviews.|`|TM09z7teaa	Use the L'oreal Mineral Foundation.<br>  Its just like bare minerals but cheaper.|`|2JQDpcZ5aa	i love everyday minerals :) its fantastic!<br>  however, if you have sensitive skin, i would go for pur minerals, as it doesnt break people out as much!
0parZMOGaa	I thnk that is a nice dress for that occasion and would really suit your skin tone. i would probably go with a pair of silver shoes like in the picture that arent busy buti would get a pair without the strap across the ankle because that makes the legs look shorter and fatter. i would also say a pearly white/ cream coloured purse with a silver chain strap would look nice i dont knw why i thought that but i could just imagine it going with that dress. hope it helped x|`|VYJp1Tifaa	i luv it|`|QMYNU9uNaa	Very pretty! I think it is definitely wedding appropriate and also good for your age too. I think it would be cute with some metallic bronze heels, or maybe even silver. You could also find a cute silver clutch to wear with it.|`|AA11558287	its very pretty, and the color will suit you well because of your skin tone, a nice shawl to go with it, maybe the same color or a light gold..same goes for the shoes and purse..you will look beautiful and if your planning to wear jewellery..keep it simple.<br>  <br>  hope that helped and have fun at the wedding|`|82A8E4yzaa	Yea...i really like it , and would suit your skin tone.<br>  <br>  I think it is suitable for your age - a younger or much older person couldn't wear this - only women in their 20's.<br>  <br>  Yellow is such a difficult colour..but i would say black shoes with a small clutch bag would be nice.|`|578ed1731c2aa943b2af6d8e21fe78f8aa	The dress is cool, but I don't think it will be appropriate for the wedding. I think something more shimmery and of a darker color will look good on you.|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	I think that dress is very pretty and appropriate for a wedding. Go for it.|`|dEkhLDu2aa	love the dress- perfect for a wedding. yeah it looks great for your age! i would go with a white purse and some white high heels!|`|zO0CFFvCaa	OMG no of coarse not it's beautiful!|`|CIOfNu9Kaa	that will look good <br>  get like a little purse
1SIXXye4aa	You look so much better in the after pic.  I really like your haircut.  You should not dye your hair it is really pretty, but if you do, put lighter blonde highlights throughout.|`|86VgnUmQaa	You look sooooo pretty before, I love the bows and the big hair and everything :D I think you should hold off on the dyeing and just wait until you can get your products back... the only problem in the second photo is that it's not styled like the first!|`|La9bMNQqaa	I LOVE your hair the color it is. Don't dye it! Most people look better with makeup, obviously, but you look cute both ways.|`|20l3w8S9aa	before looks better|`|ALFMVEPKaa	i think both look good|`|tzMMFPr4aa	honestly i think you look soooo much prettier without the scene hair and make-up on :)|`|vly8Q1lYaa	Hmmm, i think the darkest you should dye your hair is light brown and leva esome blonde higlights in it like this:<a href="http://www.hairstylescut.com/images/celebrity-hairstyles/JoJo4.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairstylescut.com/images/cele...</a><br>  <br>  because you have very pale skin.As 4 the pics..i think the second one looks better.|`|Bg2hO0g3aa	Hahaha that is a cruel and unusual punishment. The After looks better. Make it darker!|`|NUBeg2paaa	You look better without the whole teased hair.|`|fKuvMPCiaa	Much better after, the before picture is a mess|`|LZtsKaT2aa	i like your hair better when its teased.<br>  and you shouldnt dye it but if you do dye it dark,|`|Zk5PTmrfaa	Sweep your bangs to the side[:|`|MSzjOOOjaa	after girl|`|LynprVLYaa	Yeah u look better without the teased hair. But that sucks ur grounded from makeup :(|`|AA10904201	Ok I think you obviously look better in the first one because you have makeup on.Everyone looks better with make up.<br>  But to be honest with you I did have to examine both carefully, it was close!!!<br>  I think your hair is lovely but if ur gonna die it, i would say blonde definitely!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!! xxx|`|80ae467ed055b359dd0298837bbcc1d3aa	I really like the before picture. I think that the after one looks a little bit too plain jane on you.<br>  :]<br>  I think that your hair would look nice in a darker brown color, not black though.|`|islKUfOnaa	The first one is better, although it's a weird haircut.<br>  Full on bangs don't work well with your face structure.<br>  <br>  You would look good as a brunette. I don't know what kind of color you're looking for.|`|OoLJQNYwaa	i like the first picture, your hair looks pretty the color it is now but it would also look nice to in a darker blonde or light brunette color|`|wXOoNwvuaa	i like the first one. and leave ur hair that color. if you really wanna dye your hair go for high-lights or low-lights which ever 1 fits ur personality better.|`|1PsQjMUcaa	The before looks better. The after is ok but it is kinds plain. I like how your bangs r styled in the before|`|tckI1g3Naa	the second looks way better, I love it. as for color maybe a deep red would look nice with your skin tone and light eyes.|`|1d5dd8de2008c59f27a78e062fcc7db6aa	Get your grades up and color your hair...|`|hdHEZ1phaa	without the teased hair! way better! and dark brown!|`|TU6hZ2Beaa	I like before more|`|NF0fUntZaa	both look weird.|`|C8Hym9akaa	I like the second look better. <br>  and if it were me, I'd go for like a light brownish..

5Jvw2l7raa	Hi there,<br>  Well in my opinion I prefer light make up. When people have heavy make up it looks far too much and like they have just caked it on which seriously looks ridiculous, not to be offencive. So just go lightly when wearing make up and you will look great. Also, some girls use far too much foundation. You only need a bit. If you just use a little bit then you will realise that it looks much better than when you wear a lot of foundation. Another tip, is light eye shadow looks better too. It's ok to do a high light but if your going for a real dramatic look then don't. A matte colour on your lid or a smokey look on the lid is ok. But try not to go onto the brow bone.<br>  Hope this answers your question.<br>  Natalie x<br>  P.s: If you would like anymore advice then email me at:<br>  collinsonnatalie@yahoo.com|`|nyihTQCraa	i really think its about knowing how to balance your look.<br>  i myself love heavy makeup at night , smoky eyes and so on but i always make sure i wear small earrings, no necklaces and usually one bracelet...and heavy should always be in the eyes only, not all over the face!<br>  <br>  whenever i feel like light makeup, i like wearing bigger earrings or any other acessory that makes me look like a bit more well dressed....<br>  <br>  i myself would say light or heavy is up to the mood you are in at the moment, theres really no rule or anything, if you feel like heavy go for it otherwise light will work just as fine!<br>  <br>  YouTube is a great source for makeup videos do a search if u have some time !<br>  <br>  good luck !|`|HyxRTdjdaa	well for a regular day, it would be niceto have a natural not so much makeup look<br>  and for a party, maybe a little on the heavier side. <br>  but anything would work, a little blush, mascara, eyeliner, and an eyeshadow u feel like wearing that day! :)|`|MFUfXB9Caa	I prefer light for a natural, everyday look. Heavy make up is too dark for the day, i'd only wear it to a party or somewhere like that.|`|MDE4CLz8aa	For a party or natural I go with light makeup.<br>  <br>  But Heavy Makeup is when you wanna get dramatic..or something like that.|`|TRBTo9Deaa	well for starters the idea is to look like your not wearing any..<br>  that should answer your question<br>  but if not<br>  go with light|`|fWWYc2UZaa	less is more.<br>  if you wear light makeup, nobody can say anything.<br>  but if you wear it heavy, people can say "i bet she's ugly under all that."<br>  sometimes heavy can look really fake and cakey.<br>  plus, i know guys would rather you not wear much makeup at all.<br>  it just gets smudged and everything. and if people are close, you can smell it. its just bad. a little eyeliner, mascara, cover-up and lip gloss goes a long way. don't hide your beauty, enhance it.|`|QAEQqgzyaa	I don't like the overly made up look I think it just ends up making a woman look like a drag queen. I think if you have the skin to go natural then your really lucky lol. I like the ''natural but polished'' look.|`|6HP348pAaa	I like light better. :) That's what I prefer. When people put their make up too heavy, it hides their natural beauty.|`|s5y6SZhnaa	Light<br>  <br>  The only place you can go heavy is eyes. on skin, it looks like crap.|`|V2F8YCa2aa	Light. When you go to dark, you look kinda goth, and like some one has maybe punched you or something.|`|M6PsYn56aa	Heavy baby
fTbYEKGuaa	Maybe you are mature for your age, or have a wonderful personality. Even if you don't specifically return her feelings, you should feel flattered.<br>  <br>  Hugs&kisses,<br>  Adrian|`|Wn4NVHeeaa	ew, thats kinda gross. maybe she likes younger guys?|`|a7aea4b65a238072e2870b8928d610a5aa	She probably has some sort of mental disorder.  No joke.  Look it up.  She probably is some sort of crackpot with low self esteem.  She probably looks 45, not 30.  She wants to relive her youth, and to do this she hits on guys WAYYYY too young for her.  If she's a smokin' hot cougar, then go for it, dude!|`|C0pk4kgJaa	"Why doesnt she stick to women her own age?" I Don't get that. Is she lesbian?

A 25 year old hit on my 18 year old friend.|`|c26Ae2y1aa	I guess the same concept goes to the 33 year old men who enjoy the ladies in their 20s. Perhaps age doesn't matter to her...|`|xcO2W5Kiaa	Uhhh its kinda weird <br>  but maybe she likes younger men<br>  and she might be going through a mid life crisis|`|z0tk6XSvaa	maybe its because she likes you for you and doesnt care about age.|`|cdb9e0af6b46d36a188fb41a3cd9e16daa	Girls usually find younger guys adorable.

Your welcome =]|`|oRr9SOIqaa	Yep, it's good =]|`|VYMOwgc3aa	Okay so you want hair like Synyster Gates?<br>  <br>  It's almost long enough, but not quite there yet. Just wait a little bit longer.

Just have them cut it the same as in the picture, but a little shorter.  Then just keep it growing and once it's longer all you'll need is a trim to keep it looking like that.<br>  <br>  Btw I LOVE Avenged Sevenfold <3|`|2v60zG5Faa	well mayebe another three months then maybe xx|`|L7ka0dikaa	You....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  are hot.

XaYHMNusaa	Go talk to your tattoo artist.  They may be able to fix it.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	You can go to another shop and see if they can cover it or fix it. If not i would say you will have to laser remove it.|`|HOdblqIkaa	Wait till its healed, take care of it like you took care of your other tattoos and once it is healed if you still don't like it go back to the artist. If he or she realizes that they messed up they may either fix it or offer to cover it or do something to customize it and make it look better, at little to no cost. Only time will tell if you like it or not but you have to wait until its healed no matter what. And go back to the parlor you went to because going to a new place you have little hope of a true artist working over anothers art piece.|`|tPFHLcisaa	If you really don't like it get it removed. Although that hurts more than getting it in the first place acording to my sister. (Then again, she was drunk when she got it done, and on her reds when she got it removed, lol.)|`|Ym1vJtXfaa	You will come to regret every single tattoo you have, so when you schedule the procedure to remove that one - do them all.<br>  Oh, and get rid of that husband of yours. He's not very nice.|`|0parZMOGaa	laser removal or a cover up tattoo|`|zxmfNzEWaa	i dont have any tattoos but i want to get one and i think that well if you like it then keep it, i mean you got it because you liked it so it shouldn't matter what your husband thinks i think he will get over it and might even end up liking it ofter a while. <br>  <br>  but if you really end up not liking it then laser removel is the way to go :)
XaYHMNusaa	Have you been doing sea salt soaks?  Those are the best for promoting healing and drawing lymph and impurities out.  Also, you may want to go to the doctor to see if they think you have an infection.  If you do, don't let the doctor take your earring out, as that will put you at risk for getting an abcess [where the infection is].  But take advantage of antibiotics if you can get a prescription.|`|cJAf4pU0aa	Sounds infected, nothing serious, just keep it washed and cleaned 3 times a day and apply Neosporian ointment to it, and loosen the earring or just put a smaller earring on, so it gets some more air.<br>  It happens to me once in awhile too.|`|gfzFtMFnaa	A new piercing is a delicate thing.  You need to keep twisting the earring in the lobe and keep it clean!!! Twisting the earring helps keeps the site open and not developing crust or infection.<br>  <br>  You need to use rubbing alcohol on the site.  Wash your hands and then put some rubbing alcohol on your fore finger and your thumb and apply the alcohol to your ear.  It will sting, but it will clean the site and reduce the swelling because the infection will go away after several applications.<br>  <br>  You need to apply the alcohol several times a day. Not just once or twice.  Once your ear is better, keep using the alcohol daily. Keep the site clean.  That goes for both ears.  You should have no trouble after that.<br>  <br>  PS. I have had my ears pierced since I was 14 and that was a long time ago. ( DO NOT take your earrings out! )
NNX8Qu5Taa	what about a high waisted skirt, cute top to tuck in, tights , stilletos, and a nice necklace, and curl your hair ?|`|TwPrP32Paa	no no no. if u want to look smart wear a black skirt and a cool sweatervest.|`|XXF8mKj3aa	for me black always smart. its fine that you are going to wear that dress.
9794VMZ9aa	My hair used to be like that all the time. One day I got sick of the shampoo I was using (its smell was bugging me!) so I switched to my sis's anti-dandruff shampoo. I haven't had greasy hair since!<br>  It's odd, but it's because some greasyness is caused by invisible dandruff. So I suggest you switch shampoos and see if it makes ay difference!<br>  <br>   (I used Head and Shoulders first, but then decided Wash and Go would be better because it's for all hair types. It was better, but the smell fades a bit)<br>  <br>  If, after 2 weeks, if you don't see any difference, you're just gonna have to leave it. You could try baby powder if you want, but it has little effect. <br>  <br>  Lol, never trust Vannessa.|`|yximUUhuaa	First of all, a week without bathing? Ew. But anyways.... most peoples hair does get greasy when they don't wash it everyday. I use Garneir Frutis and it works well for me.

I'm not a big fan of wearing shorts with leggings, but that's just me. Also, I some people don't like wearing (or seeing people wear) bad quality (as you described it) clothing, but it really depends on how bad the quality is. Also, I don't particularly like rain boots, but hey, if it's raining outside then why not? Finally, I haven't seen it on you, but SOMETIMES leggings and Converse don't go together. But it's possible that it was only on the 1 person I saw it on. But, no. You're outfits and sense of style is definitely NOT tacky.|`|68Qm2W8waa	i don't know to be honest that sounds typically like the type of clothes alot of young people wear all the time. trust me im still in high school. i mean as long as you don't end up wearing exactly the same thing as somebody else, and you know you had a little of your own flair to it you'll look fine. at my school i don't think i ever see people who wear aeropostale or hollister ever wearing converse with it too but i think it sounds really cute, i would probably do the same except i have such big feet converse shoes look like clown shoes on me =/ if you feel blah or tacky i mean you could add some jewlery and wear a few bracelets get a nice necklace to go with some of your outfits and wear dangly earings or just simple little earings. you could wear a head band or  wear a cute scarf.|`|0H9Y99Kwaa	Your style is your style...be a little crazy with it dont be scared to wear something a little crazy....Necklaces always add to an outfit, forever 21 has really cute ones that can go with anything!|`|2SScKK2Gaa	I actaully like your outfits! They sound really cute, but maybe in the last outfit change the polka dot rainboots and the zip-up aero sweater.<br>  <br>  CUTE OUTFITS THOUGH :)|`|H5PFEtVQaa	all of them are ugly you'll look like an emo punk.<br>  if i would pick one id do...EXP3 but with out the converse.|`|mtQfJlH6aa	Dont change your look:)) From what it sounds like, you know what youre doing!!

b85nVIzoaa	Mainly, it's the outline of a tatt that hurts most but the skin goes kinda numb after that, at least that's been my experience of it ( I have 4). When you say your upper arm, is it a wrap-around? If not it shouldn't be too painful. Black is supposed to be the most painful colour to get but it really isn't that much more painful than other colours.<br>   Hope it goes well for you

DdUmku2oaa	Hey Maz, been a while<br>  <br>  I think your ears will be fine but give it a couple of days. If it continues to hurt the same or worse after like 3 days then it'd be best to take off the earrings and let it heal. Hope your ears get better.<br>  <br>  xoxo|`|XhwxmP7vaa	yes, it will be tender and hurt..it's really important to use a ear piercing solution and turn the ear rings to they don't stick to the new piercing and sure the backing is not too tight|`|tnUhxfjlaa	well yeah its supposed to hurt, you just got needles shoved through your ear.  As long as its not an excruciating pain, then your good|`|d3f005ddefb1ad4a72c6901433c1c89daa	Duh.............|`|DbjlIVFcaa	Yes this is normal, when you get something pierced your body goes into shock because it is not used to it. It will get better eventually.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earring" rel="nofollow">http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earring</a><br>  <br>  <br>  this will help.<br>  |`|2DMGtY7Kaa	Yes, for the first week it will tend to hurt, soon enough the pain will go away. Just take some pills if it hurts. if it doesn't stop hurting, I suggest you see a doctor.|`|kKRMBHs3aa	yeah mine had greenish lines around it (i'm not sure what it is,looked like veins though) on the first day but it healed completely a week later|`|mu1nxKuxaa	No. What finger are you touching your ear with? Maybe your finger is broken?|`|tfqpb5XQaa	You just shoved a needle (Or gun which is worse) through your ear, did you expect it not to?<br>  Especially when its two on one ear at the same time, yeah that makes it hurt a fair bit more|`|EJZVgQyNaa	yeah it is normal but if it doesn't stop hurting after 5 days think about getting medical help, as you may have an infection.
rVJN4UNwaa	Everyone I have met with a haircut like that, the haircut was part of their personality.  So if people are critiquing the haircut, its hard not to take it as a jolt to your personality, so I can understand why it gets you down.<br>  <br>  My advice:  consider that most people don't think enough to be criticizing your personality, they're just stupid.  |`|WFAkPqAYaa	 haha agreeage on the 'frankenstine' comment..!|`|Hvuqv6duaa	it looks fine..?|`|auFmP7J1aa	i think it looks a little bit<br>  like Frankenstein's hair (sorry)<br>  But you could try to use less<br>  gel. make it just messy or <br>  something and try not to<br>  use any gel at all. try to do <br>  it like your avatar's hair. :D<br>  hope that helps.|`|XLRx5decaa	Frankly (excuse the pun), it looks like frankenstein.|`|raqcEXFwaa	I think it looks perfectly fine, but it could look a bit better (to me anyways) if you cut it a little bit shorter then gelled it... just sayin. Good luck!|`|gGYLOK1vaa	well personally i'd have to join in the crowd, it's just how it's gelled down into points...<br>  <br>  But if YOU like it then keep it =)|`|Y1lHRaVaaa	Ya, I can see why, no offense, don't put it in your face so much and get it cut. |`|O3OBrXk2aa	looks fine to mee.... just dont listen to them. theyre probably jealous!

5OrpCq6zaa	massage it with warm olive oil|`|2I5XqMDzaa	dont cut it lol and take vitamin E|`|TfJn3KJvaa	Hair typically grows 1/3 of an inch every month no matter what but if you take good care of your hair you can grow up to an inch a month.<br>  <br>  I suggest taking hair, skin, and nail vitamins, available at any drug store or wal-mart. Things to look for are vitamin B complex, vitamin E, and biotin (vitamin b7). Eat healthy and get plenty of protein and dark green vegetables. Hair is mainly composed of protein. Eggs contain a ton of protein. Also foods containing "gelatin" are good for your hair such as yogurt and jello. Google "hair growth foods" for ideas. Also try daily scalp massages using your fingertips to stimulate hair growth, it gets blood flowing in your scalp and feels great. Avoid frying your hair at all costs. Get plenty of sleep and excercise, especially cardiovascular excercises like running. Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and stress. <br>  <br>  A good conditioner is also important. Sunsilk is amazing and cheap, the kind I am currently using contains jojoba oil wich is AMAZING. Any sunsilk product is amazing and cheap.<br>  <br>  If you have fried hair, do not dye it anymore and try hot oil treatments, and do not use shampoo every day. I leave contitioner in for about 5 minutes before washing it out to keep mine looking healthy. If you have split ends get them trimmed to avoid it getting worse.|`|fpyRo8Noaa	if ur a female u can take prenatals....they reallly work

qZaNu8Hvaa	Get a tux......they look way better then a suit. I like wearing tux, they are custom fit so they are way more comfortable. When you wear a tux you just feel more sophisticated. You can also do more with a tux when it comes to ties and vests and colors.|`|3UVPe2xraa	Wear a tux with a black shirt and black skinny tie. omg that is soooo sexy.|`|5Up1iL3Saa	I think a guy looks better in a tux.

HyrRPQySaa	tooth paste gose a long way. then hide it with coverup....|`|ZYi2ZlUnaa	First of all, DON'T POP IT!!!!! It only makes it more red and won't heal as fast. Rub hydrogen peroxide on it and then use some acne spot treatment. It should help it go down. When you go to the party, put on some concealer. I recommend one with salycic acid in it, so the zit will be treated and covered up at the same time.|`|WeOMih26aa	K this sounds random but it works! Take two advil pills and crush them up. The take a very small amount of water and mix it with the advil to make a paste. Put the paste on the zit and leave it for as long as you can. I usually pop the zit so it's open to the medicine. And I think a big ol' whitehead on someones face is just gross. If it swells and turns red you can put ice on it. That will make the swelling go down. Good luck!

Most colour choices should be obvious....for example someone with your colouring wearing blue eyeshadow .....scary......it just wouldnt work, clashes with your hair and hazel eyes and your pale warm skin tone....<br>  <br>  heres a quick summary for you to help and im taking into consideration your skin eye and hair colour when im saying this:<br>  <br>  Purples/lilacs/violets: these can be used on your eyes as shadow to bring out the green in your hazel eyes, dont use plum though...too deep. Obviously never use these shades on your lips...<br>  <br>  warm orangey reds: U can definetly get away with this shade for your lips, even if you think you cant or someone in the past has said no...as long as it is a warm goldy orangey red it will work....never use these shades as eyeshadows..<br>  <br>  true cool reds and burgundy: not the best for you, too cool for your colouring, and the burgundy too severe and could make you look older.<br>  <br>  light blue/sky blue/medium/dark blue: step away from them...<br>  <br>  black: dont even consider it, waaay to harsh and wont do anything for you.<br>  <br>  Browns: these are very important for you. Your mascara and eyeliner should always be brown, never black or any other shade. Dark brown is probably best....you can use browns as eyeshdows too if you like..<br>  <br>  deep forest green/jade green/gold green/ blue-green: can all be used as shadows<br>  <br>  lime green/cool apple green: too cold for you.....<br>  <br>  yellow/orange: nope forget it.....<br>  <br>  gold: perfect to use as shadow/highlighter/gloss/lipstick<br>  <br>  silver/grey: too cold, dont use these ever...<br>  <br>  light pink/baby pink: i know most people are addicted to these colours as lipgloss but they wont make you look amazing unless they're a warm light pink, i have found two warm light pinks that you could try if you want to wear pink on your lips....bourjois gloss no.3 rose idyllic and clinique buttershine in pink a boo....you can get away with warm dusty pinks on your eyes but they'd look better if mixed with gold and browns on hazel eyes....<br>  <br>  peaches/pumpkin oranges/rust/terracottas: absolutely perfect for the lips as gloss or lipstick...not to be used on the eyes though..<br>  <br>  as for your foundation, get one that matches your skin tone exactly..no lighter...no darker.<br>  <br>  Okay im tired now, hope i helped...:)
dae34b4ef56cf9f9a9c29d363b3c4bc8aa	If this is what I think it is...the kind that is round and looks like a home food canner, these are not appropriate for the tattoo industry.  One of the problems with this is that it does not have a drying cycle so it is basically worthless.  You have to watch it continuously to be sure it stays at the correct temp and time.  The basket cannot get any water in it so you have to be sure it is the right amount of water.  Too many variables.<br>  <br>  As far as the color change bags, they only tell you if the bag has been exposed to heat.  It does not indicate sterility.

nyihTQCraa	ive tried all brands, good ones, expensive ones, cheap ones, and so on!<br>  <br>  the best i would say is L'Occitane ! it's a bit expensive but believe me you will not regret it, ever !<br>  <br>  usually the hair pro brands (Redken, Paut Mitchel, Kerastase ) contain too much queratin wich makes your hair look good on the first usages but after sometime your hair get used to these substances and then will look heavy and not as good as it was.<br>  <br>  browse at l'occitane site and you will just know what i mean, their products are made from french oils and ive never used anything like that before, believe me !<br>  <br>  good luck and let us know if you ever use it :D|`|gXRz3U7Vaa	dont use sunsilk, pantene, or fruitis.. they all make your hair fall out. i would use aussie or tressme. i have the same problem.|`|vrJC0UStaa	sunsilk thermashine|`|Eej0Ndp5aa	Listen, I do the same straightening thing & had very brittle, fried, damaged hair. I started using Suave Damage Care (shampoo & conditioner) It's in a light blue bottle, at Walmart, it's verrry cheap, works, & smells good! :) I used to use Suave extreme strength shampoo & conditioner & it worked great also I just had to switch it up after a while.<br>  <br>  Idk about a straightening product that DOESNT require a flatiron but you should try this protecting stuff called "Vroom" it's in a black bottle with a gold lid, it's a bit much for a small sized bottle ($15) but it's definitely worth it. You have to go to salons to get it though.|`|0FSBiLQVaa	Dove damages control shampoo and conditioner. It will repair your hair and will make your hair easier to take care of. You may want to use a moisturizing product and stop straightening your hair with a flat iron, at least until the damage is under control. If you want to use a blow dryer, use it on low heat. When you flat iron, use a product that will protect your hair. When you use conditioner if your hair is damaged or dry, use a lot of it and do not rinse all of it out!

Also layer it to make it look thick and lush.|`|lf71iGb0aa	Get A Bob (:
WeOMih26aa	Whenever I get my makeup professionally done, they ask me where I want it. So i think you can wear it wherever you think it looks best. But if you wear it above the lashes on that rim, you're more prone to getting an infection. I would wear it below the lashes and instead of one straight line, smudge it a little to make it softer or use brown eyeliner. Just a warning though, putting dark on the lower half of the eye will make your eyes appear a lot smaller than they really are. If you want to try something different, get white liner and line the lower rim of your eye. It will make you look so awake and make your eyes huge! Good luck!|`|pD6K1rLkaa	I do it above the lashes, if it's on too low it might look smudged.|`|MFUfXB9Caa	I apply mine on the waterline. Its just personal preference where you like it.|`|Tpnx44dnaa	if you apply it above it comes off sooner|`|dMh7W86jaa	It depends on your taste (=|`|6xmIPYimaa	below. if it's above it can itch your eye. It's bad to have it on the mucus membranes 9 it causes infections). :)|`|HyxRTdjdaa	well it matters on ur look. so try putting it above the eyelashes and see how that looks. sometimes i put a little above and a little below but not all bottom when i put my eyeliner below my lashes. i stop at my pupil. :) idk if that made any sence but yea!
tqYpkDyEaa	You're gorgeous!  I LOVE your eyes!<br>  <br>  Anyways, I'd say your face shape is heart shaped.<br>  I'd part it on the left side, and definitely recommend side swept bangs.<br>  I think a chocolate color would look good on you, or if you'd consider it, super blonde hair.  Just a thought, though!|`|Uubhpmxtaa	you have a heart shaped face. I'de part my hair to the side.

2f243afa7f4c0f759856b9d4cceec252aa	first  put a volumizer in your hair, then blowdry after that piece by piece section your hair into like 1/1/2 inch sections curl them with a curling iron , size depending on how long your hair is, then rolls them up after that and pin them to your hair  with pin curl clips and spray it with hairspray, then let them out and loosely shake your hair and move your fingers through your hair  until you get the look you want works great|`|AA11190723	they use extentions|`|AA11246070	use large curlers|`|AA11543257	Try hot rollers.

You can put this on your hair after you wash your hair and keep scrunching it.  After it dries... you can use hot rollers to make bigger type curls in it.  The gel helps give it some volume first.|`|5b9d9b2b1e1871187b4d6f1cda0325d5aa	use a hair paste.. its not gel (gel dries out your hair because of the alcohol). use a alcohol free serum or paste and cover the seperate pieces and vola!|`|AA11167962	MONEY.  They pay a lot of money for expert hair stylists.  They get extensions, which are very expensive.  But sometimes in teen magazines, they will show how to style your hair to look like celebrities.|`|AA12072367	well they probably use extensions but if you use hot curlers or just your curling iron and curl it at a downward angle it can work. Also they actually make a curling iron that is made to do your hair that way. I saw it at target it was like 20 dollars|`|AA11276839	you need a thick curling iron, like babyliss.

If you're willing to pay a little more, you can always go to Barney's, Neiman Marcus or Nordstrom, where they offer brands like Rock and Republic and True Religion. <br>  You can also check online.

cXvZr3Xmaa	I do face painting at all my church's festivals and events.<br>  <br>  With my current low cash flow, I just head to Walmart and they have a package of face paints (basic primary colors..can be mixed to make other colors) for a few dollars.  I think I paid $4 or $5 dollars.<br>  <br>  I found the same package at a few different craft stores, but they were all at least $1 more.  Some were even $5 more..for the same exact thing.<br>  <br>  Eventually, because I really enjoy face painting, I will get a more professional, higher quality set, but the one at Walmart does work great.  Each color paint comes in a little jar with a screw top.  It's more of a liquid paint than some of the professional types that are more chalky.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|8tLS1XDWaa	Walmart or Micheals or any craft stores... maybe 10-20$|`|MR4LFMY0aa	craft stores|`|bl0bBbdxaa	At the dollar store

You need the box for highlighting or frosting. the regular stuff doesn't even get my roots, the highlighting and frosting kits comes with a cap and tool to pull hair thru, it's the only thing that will blonde dark hair(That's what I use). But you will need to wait atleast 3 weeks before trying the red, and you'll have to try I dark red to get the blonde highlights out. When I do red with my blonde it's close to 3 weeks before the red really starts to show. Hope this helps.|`|vcjlwlD7aa	At home color / bleach sometimes doesn't always work especially if you drying to lift your color to blonde. You might need to go to a salon.|`|1d5dd8de2008c59f27a78e062fcc7db6aa	Did you mix the color correctly?|`|CkNwLXLeaa	Umm make sure your hair is a little dirty because hair color takes better that way.<br>  <br>  <br>  and depending on how blonde you go you might want to bleach your hair first then do the box of blonde hair dye.|`|8tLS1XDWaa	I would make sure your following the instructions or try using a different dye company....
ZUAFl3toaa	Well, there's no point in removing if it is lighter than you natural color that has grown out, because all you have to do is do a full head dye that's a tiny be lighter than your natural color which will even it out without changing the natural color. I'm not really understanding what color the grown out dyed hair is though because ashy is the complete opposite of red, so it's one or the other, it can't be both. If it is ashy, just dying over it like I said will work fine, and if it is red you need to get a green/ash based toner which will offset the red, or dye your whole head a brown base with a red tone.<br>  <br>  No matter what you do though, do not buy a box dye. They don't say what base they are, they don't sell toner, and they are a completely different kind of dye than real dye. All you have to do is go to Sally's and they sell the dye in tubes with color swatches and bases explained (R (red) G (gold) N (neutral... which would be "ashy" B (brown)... etc.) and then the box will tell you what developer to get, and what mixture to make. The girls at Sally's will be able to help you, honestly it's hard to tell you exactly what to do because I would need to see exactly what your hair looks like, so I would have someone look at it in person.<br>  <br>  If anyone else on here tells you "oh this is all you have to do!" keep in mind they can't see your hair, and probably aren't a licensed cosmetologist... I would suggest having one look at your hair though so they can tell you exactly what to do. I've seen a lot of people talking about stripping the color out, but they don't realize the fact that your natural hair color is NOT under that dye, that dye is the only color in that hair, so if you strip it, you're going to end up with a yellowy white color that you're going to have to dye over anyway, which is why I said, if the color is lighter than your natural color, there is no reason to remove the dye. All that would be doing is damaging your hair and making it much more difficult to correct because it would be so much farther off from your natural color than it is now.|`|p4nresGGaa	It is possible to have hair dye stripped from your hair. However, not only can this be expensive, but it can do serious damage to your hair - the chemicals used need to be strong enough to pull out chemicals that are designed to be permanent. <br>  <br>  It would be best if you could let the colour grow out naturally, but if not you should talk to your hairdresser. They might be able to advise you on less harsh ways of reducing or removing the dye, such as ways to partially remove the dye - this would be less harsh than a full dye strip but would remove some of the dye and bring the dyed sections closer to your natural colour. <br>  <br>  You could also consider dyeing the dyed part the colour of your natural hair - if you only re-dye the section that has been dyed before, then there won't be lasting damage, as the dye won't go to your roots. It can then be allowed to grow out without the dyed/non-dyed contrast being noticeable.|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	I think you can strip it, but I think it needs to be done professionally?<br>  <br>  I could totally be mistaken.  It's have to be a HARSH chemical, though.  I'd recommend dying your hair back to your natural color and letting it grow it out instead.  Too many chemicals will fry your hair, you know?|`|AA11461724	you can try using a box of "color oops" hair dye remover from walgreens or rite aid. they make extra strength and extra conditioning, they're both around $10.00. i used it once recently, it works really well! it doesn't damage at all and gets all the color out, if you use it properly. you put it in your hair, wait 20 minutes then shampoo it out and rinse for 15-20 minutes. you have to be sure to wash and rinse really well 'cause that's how it removes the color. if you don't get it all out, any dye that was left in your hair could re darken it over time or if you redye. the thing about it is if you dyed your hair lighter, it won't bring you back to your true natural color, it will just remove all color and reveal the brassy color the peroxide in the dye made your hair so it recommends that you redye it after you use it, which is perfectly safe! so that's why you have to be sure to rinse out all the color!  you could try putting it only on the colored part of your hair, then redye just that part. but if you get color oops on your natural color it won't alter it. you could ask for a friend's help if that's too difficult. it's your best bet, 'cause if you were to dye over this reddish color with a dye that matches your natural color, it won't cover the red tones. good luck!|`|0W0JwfAcaa	usually ppl tell you to wait and let it grow  out but if it makes you happy do it
