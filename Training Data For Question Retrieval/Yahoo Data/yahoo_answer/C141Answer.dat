zcYl3ftTaa	"Comfort nursing serves a purpose, too. Studies seem to indicate that this type of sucking overall decreases a baby's heart rate and lets him relax. It seems to have a very positive effect on his whole physical and emotional well-being. Don't be afraid to allow this type of nursing. Breastfeeding is more than just imparting fluids and nourishment. It's a way to nurture your child as well."|`|Fd4lITkvaa	She is wrong. Her advice is for bottle fed babies and even then 3hrs is normal for most bottle fed babies as well. A bottle fed baby can be over fed which is why you shouldn't use formula for comfort. Your body will adjust the fat content of your milk based on how often your baby feeds so they can't over eat even if you nurse 15 times a day, that would be my son. As your baby gets older you can snuggle and give kisses for comfort more often, for now nursing is best.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	tell her that breastfed babies should be fed on demand- it's completely different than bottle feeding. someone who has no experience should not be giving advise     babies shouldn't nurse just for feeding. if a baby can have a paci then they should be able to nurse for comfort- i was my son's paci and he's fine. in fact he's the kid that falls down and gets back up and doesn't even whimper|`|UghJ0XROaa	No, she is not. Babies need comfort just as much as they need food. If her way of getting comfort some days is by nursing, enjoy it. The day is going to come when you won't be nursing and you will regret the moments when you chose not to nurse her, because you didn't want her to comforted that way.|`|Ezkn5azdaa	My daughter is two months old. And I am breastfeeding her. She eats every 2 to 2 1/2 hours. The breast milk digest faster and easier then formula. When baby have a growth spurt they eat a lot more then anything.|`|vue9NOhYaa	No, she's not right.  Breastfeeding isnt' just about food to a baby, but also about comfort and bonding and feeling loved. You cannot possible 'ruin' a baby by loving her and meeting her needs. Where on earth did you mom get THAT idea.    And at any rate, 4 hours would be far too long for a breastfeed 3 month old to go between feeds.  If you WERE to opt to feed on a schedule, 2 1/2-3 hours would be the more realistic one for this age.     Your mom not only didn't breastfeed herself, but (depending on how old YOU are) probably raised her children at a time when babies WERE expected to go 4 hours between feeds ... which is one of the reasons that most women who tried to breastfeed back in the day 'failed'....|`|qStmw7qgaa	I think you need to do what is right for you and your daughter and not necessarily listen to someone who has personally experienced what you are doing.  I don't mean that in any disrespectfully towards your mom...but if she hasn't been there, then she can't say what you are doing is wrong.  Your daughter can get into a bad habit with breast feeding for comfort, so you may want to be a little careful...but you are in no way ruining your daughter.  Do what you feel is right for you and your daughter, and tell your mom you love her, but back off.  :-)|`|wKYdIaZVaa	My mom often tries to tell me how to do certain things that I don't agree with. I simply explain to her that I'm doing what I WANT to do because Chloe is MY daughter. I thank her for the advice and continue to do things my way. (unless her advice makes sense to me)    As far as your mother giving you advice on something she knows nothing about, just ignore her. You're doing everything right. Breast milk is digested a lot faster than formula, hence why you feed more often. Also, there is nothing wrong with comfort nursing. Just try to explain to her that you know what you're doing and to simply leave it alone.     Best of luck!|`|hTQg5tgPaa	at this point your daughter need comfort support & love.  I heard that you can't overfeed a nursed baby (by nursing).  Mine nursed all the time and couldn't understand why until we figured it out after one of the doctor appointments.  She was growing like a weed.  Was born in the 50-60 percentile range and within two months was in the top 95 percent.  She grew 4" in 2 months.  Your child is the best gage & will nurse when they need.  Sometimes they nurse to get the "hind" milk.  Mine would cluster feed for 3.5 hours at one point, its to get the fatty part of the milk & to build up your supply.  I think that when they are older that is what discipline is for - not ruining her.  right now you can't spoil them because they don't understand yet.  Just needs tlc (tender love & care).  Good luck.  Another little bit of advice that my uncle gave is to "acknowledge when people offer advice and then do it your way".  I think your mom has good intentions, but there have been studies that have been done since when we were children and being brought up.  My daughter is healthy active and is well behaved.    Btw it is common for children who are nursed to put on more weight in the first 6 months then level off.  Mine did... they need the fat for when they start crawling and walking (burn it all off then).  I love to nurse mine for comfort!!! I THINK THAT IT COMFORTS ME JUST AS MUCH AS IT DOES HER!!|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	You are doing nothing wrong. Babies that young can NOT be spoiled. So if nursing is a form of comfort for her and you don't have a problem with it comfort on girl! Its funny when you have a baby how everyone in the world is so willing to tell you what your doing wrong isn't it. My advice is to do things your way. You can't ruin her by being too comforting when she is an infant. Boo to those whose judge or criticize you for that.|`|AC1v9v4Saa	I don't think your mother is right at all, you should surround yourself around other nursing moms.  Babies have growth spurts, this is obviously because your baby is growing and breastfeeding often will produce more milk that the baby needs.  All babies nurse differently, It is all about supply and demand.  Breastfeeding is a very close bond between mom and baby and i don't think any professional would ever say babies only nurse to be fed, they do it for comfort as well and I don't think anything is wrong with that.  I have 2 children one is 3 1/2 years and I breastfed him until he was 12 1/2 months old and i have a 4 month old and plan on doing the same, if not longer with him.  I nursed my first child for many reasons, when he was hungry, when he was hurt or to help him fall asleep.  You aren't ruining her  you are letting her know she can trust you and feel comforted by you.  Good luck!!!
Jo2DfRzaaa	I think every child is different and every kid goes through different phases at different times.  I know my daughter has always been fine with staying w/a select group of people, there was never a separation issue there, as long as it was those people.  Then one day, she did a 180.  freaked on me leaving her.  Of course my mom reported back to me 10 mins later and she was fine.  i don't know if it was a 1 off thing or its a new phase.  i haven't left her since that experience.  i didn't leave my house.  is this something new he is doing or has he always done it?  how long is he upset after you leave?  if it were me, and this was new, it would let it be.  i wouldn't force the issue, just yet.  let him hang w/me and whomever i want to leave him w/together.  if this has always been this way or has been going on a little while, i would make sure i was hanging with the person watching him while i was there.  make sure they comfortable, then maybe leave for 5 mins and come back.  i would keep doing that but extend the time i was gone.  might take longer that way, but i would think be easier on my child.    good luck!    BTW - I'm glad my humor isn't lost on you.  sometime i wonder if ya people know why they are thumbing me up or down. lol    EDIT - well honestly if it was always going on - i wouldn't be apt to leave either.  i'd love to tell you that i would be strong, blah, blah, blah but i wouldn't i'd crumble like a little baby if my kids cried every time i left them for some me time or me and husband time.  i'm cringing just thinking about it.  i mean you do have to do what you gotta do and if he is okay w/in 5-10 mins then i guess its okay.  maybe i'm a sucker but i hate it when my kids cry for me. let me know how it goes.  i made some advice if this wasn't a one off thing w/my daughter.....|`|i3PGjRRfaa	About 26 years old................|`|1N2wBw3Uaa	I'm 15.  But i do know, I'm closer to my mom than ever.  I hate being away from her.  We're close.    I think it depends on your closeness.|`|RvddYKqjaa	At any age. Some never ever have separation anxiety. That's our granddaughter. Some hang on until they get married, and that's our daughter. And everything in between. Our daughter's 11-year old girlfriend can't do a sleepover with her best friend, because she has to be with her parents at night. Do you best to help them over it when they are younger. When they get older, it's hard because kids tease them.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	It's normal. But you need to just let him cry it out when you leave. The longer that you cater to it, the longer it lasts. I used to hear my son screaming when we'd leave him to go have dinner or something and wanted to go back, but I didn't. And, my daughter would hang on my neck when I left her in kindergarten and cry and cry and cry! It's really hard to leave, but it's how they finally get over it. Of course they would rather be with mom and dad, but they will realize that other places aren't that bad eventually.|`|DNygQdmVaa	my son is almost 14 months old.

Sometimes they just want to go with you and feel left out or don't want to miss anything.  They think we're going out to play or going to the toy store or going to Wal*Mart.  Heaven for bid they miss out on the chance to buy something!!!
mxixfE3Raa	For first basics, such as a crib, stroller, clothes, carseat and stuff, you will need about $5000.  You will then need to buy ongoing clothes, diapers etc. which is about $50 a month.  Medical care should be free, so don't worry about that.    If you want to buy on a budget then here are some tips:  Don't be too snobby to buy second hand, even if you normall don't like buying second hand stuff, then it's fine to buy second hand clothes, toys and books.  I'd reccommend buying a brand new with the expensive things, as they will last you longer.  Also you can have a baby shower, and your friends and family can buy things such as clothes.  Also if your gf is prepared to breast feed, then this saves alot of money.  Another tip with saving money is don't buy too many of the same size in clothes and diapers.  Clothes and diaper sizes change all the time because babies grow very quick.  Don't buy any new born sizes, buy 0-3 month in clothes, babies grow out of newborn sizes in about a week or two.      When you tell your family, you need to have a plan. You need to tell your parents how much you need their help and support and tell them how you're going to raise a child.  Remember your gf is probably going to have to drop out of school as daycare is really expensive, so unless your parents support you, you can't do it.    They're going to be shocked and angry at first, but they'll come around in the end. The key to telling parents about pregnancy, is acting really mature before and after. You need to show you're mature enough to be parents. If they get angry at you, you cannot argue back, you need to be tolerant and calm with what they say.    Oh and don't mean to be rude, but you're a bit stupid for planning this, yes I understand people make mistakes, but no one your age knows what they're in for if they plan it.    I can tell you honestly now, you need to be prepared for fatherhood so i'm going to tell you what happens to parents when they have a child, especially when young.  -Their social life is non-existant, you cannot take a baby out with your friends, and they won't want to come and visit often, kids want to be out having fun, not chilling with their friends babies.  -Your parents will NOT babysit for you unless compulsory such as school, even if they support you.  -You two won't have money for yourselves, your girlfriend won't be getting her hair done, or be able to afford make-up and clothes. Babies are money drainers for the next 18 years atleast.  -Also it will be so hard for your girlfriend to have an education.  -Say goodbye to any holidays or days out for the next few years atleast.    I'm not trying to scare you, I had a baby at 16, and seriously you can never ever be ready for what being a parent brings.  I wouldn't change my life for the world, but at the same time it is the hardest thing ever, and it really does change your life completely.    Good Luck|`|AA10236289	Being responsible is different in this circumstance.  It depends on several things:    1. What State you live in.  The "baby" will need to have a "responsible adult" to care for this child.  The only way either of you will fall into this category is if you can be emancipated from your parents.  This means "being able to live on your own completely, since you are both minors".  Even if you can live on your own, there still may be an age limit in your State. If you can not prove that, then either the State, one of your parents, or and outside Social Worker/Foster Home will take custody.  That where the responsibility comes in.  The "well-being" of the child will become the main legal issue when he or she is born.    2.  Birthing cost:  This will depend on how the custody of the child turns out.  If it goes with the parents, their insurance "may" cover the cost.  If you can prove emancipation, then the State "may" cover the cost if your can not afford it.  If neither, you could be looking at $25,000 to $50,000 (or more) for the birthing and doctors.  Does not including any prenatal (before birthing) cost that you will have for check-ups.  And, hopefully she, or the child, have no problems.    If you get through all of that, then there is "Well Baby Care".    1.  Doctors visits; doctor fees; clinic fees, lab fees, etc. (depends on what needs the baby has!)  This could bury you without insurance.  Then, you might decide not to take the baby (or yourself) to the doctor because you can not afford it.      2.  Diapers, food, medicine, clothes, shelter for the baby, etc.  This will run into the thousands per year.      If you can handle all of this, and prove to the parents and/or the State that you can take care of this baby (and yourself for the protection of the baby), then you have more power than most of us at your age.    You need to tell your parents upfront.  The sooner the better.  The may never be a good time, just do it and get it over with.  Then, go from there.    Good Luck in all you do.    Regards,|`|FHRfTlCxaa	You're only 15!!You're gonna ruin your life and it really will cost a lot, but,I'm too pessimistic it might as well be all right..|`|uZt2eLUqaa	..wait. your 15 right? and you WANTED a baby..first off, you need to get a job...go to college or something. You should have done your research before you decided on any of this. As for your rents, just tell them.|`|NiOjHyfKaa	WHY WOULD YOU PLAN FOR A BABY AT 15???   VERY INTELLIGENT!!|`|4iOSq8M9aa	Bravo to the two of you for not considering abortion an option. I don't know about how prudent it was to PLAN a pregnancy but that is water under the bridge now. As for the cost, hopefully your child's mother is covered under her parent's health insurance and depending on the quality of it the cost could vary greatly. We have decent insurance and still had to pay about 3K out of pocket for each of our children. As for diapers, etc... that is a weekly expense or around 50$ or more for us. Good luck. Just be straight forward with her parents and your own.|`|Yxhbv4x0aa	i understand your view and respect your desicion but you should consider your only 15, that means roughly you have 65 years left on this earth...i hope this girl is a keeper...im not really for abortions either but you need to be responsable and take care of this child!!!  It costs roughly $10,000 - $15,000 per year to raise a child depending on where you live it could be more then that.  As for the parents they are going to kill you..lol jk...just sit them both down u and ur gurl tell em the truth, you might be afraid but people become understanding if your honest with them.  GOOD LUCK buddy your gonna need it haha|`|v3LhdCMCaa	WOW 15?????  GOOD LUCK.  I WAS 19 WHEN I HAD MY FIRST AND IT WAS HARD FOR ME.|`|AA11373080	Okay you said you planned on it, but didn't do the research first about how much time money and effort it takes to raise a child...?    Anyways, it costs a lot a month to raise a baby. Baby Center.com estimates it costs $10,000 in the FIRST Year ALONE, then you have 2 years of diapers, Childcare (Around 700 a month-if you're lucky) pre-school, raising them school fees, extra curricular activities, food shelter, and that's NOT including toys and anything the child might want.  Also you have to raise the kid until it's 18- 3 years older than you are now.    But Im sure you must have the money, since you are responsible and planned for the baby.|`|KYphLHNNaa	Why would you plan this...thats just non-sense. You don't have your own home your own money your own medical insurance...bad choice.  Wow...whats wrong with kids today?!?|`|xHKRGEg4aa	I'm sorry, this is going to sound mean, but the fact that two 15 year old kids planned to have a child is irriesponsible because you aren't going to be able to financially support the baby. But, on average each child cost about $250,000 from start to finish. Hospital bills depend on how much insurance her parents have.     The best thing to do is just sit down and tell your parents. Then go with her to tell her parents.|`|mRQxlNH5aa	Tell them to sit down and say you need to talk then explain your situation. The average first year of a baby is typically between $10,000- $16,000. Try going to this website. http://www.babycenter.com/babyCostCalcul...    it helps you figure out how much it will cost.|`|oojO4WAraa	If you were older and wiser you would realize what a stupid mistake this is.|`|tcPaHzkUaa	ha ha.you just threw your life out the window.|`|QMxEjCpiaa	You wonder how much it will cost? Go the store with your girlfriend and look at baby diapers. You'll go thru a few packs of diapers a week. Then factor in formula/food for the baby. Yes, your GF can breastfed and it will save you a few hundred dollars, but she'd need to buy a breastpump and other accessories to go with it.   If you and your GF are smart enough to want a baby and plan on it, you both are smart enough to figure out how much it will cost. I say at least $1000-$5000 during the first year.     My advice ... tell your parents together. Have your girlfriend with you and tell them. Tell them how you both feel about it and what you both plan on doing. Be grownup about it.     She'll need medical insurance + some way to eat healthy. Go apply for WIC and medicaid to help pay some bills. Also, when you turn 16, make sure you have a job. Work as much as you can so you can help provide for the baby. Tell her the same thing, when she turns 16 (or 6-8 weeks after the baby is born), she needs to get a job and start working. It isn't your parents responsibility to pay and raise your kids. You both decided to have a baby, you all pay for the baby.|`|ZaadvJAXaa	I'm just trying to figure out WHY you would say you and she planned this, yet never sat and THOUGHT about how much this might cost!!!  There is no answer to that part because one never knows how much something could cost from one day to the next.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	If you were responsible enough to plan this pregnancy, you are responsible enough to walk up to your parents and tell them "My girlfriend is pregnant".  When you and she were in the planning stages, you should have done more research on the costs of raising a child.  It's not going to be cheap.  Having a baby when you are 15 with no job, limited education and still living with your parents and dependant on them for your basic needs is very irresponsible.  I'm sure your parents and the girls parents weren't planning on supporting another child at this stage of their lives.|`|I8mnEQv1aa	yO M0M DAD MY GIRLFRIEND IS PREGNATE   $15,000|`|yOyg3gnJaa	I cannot believe that two 15 year olds planned on having a baby, and now are worried on whether or not you can afford to care for the child.  Doctor visits are around $100 a piece, and you will have one per month until you are 6 months, and then 2x a month until you are 8 months, and then 1x per week until the baby is born.  Labor and delivery and the room stay is going to cost between $12,000-$15,000 if you have a natural delivery with no complications.  Diapers cost around $20 per box and you will go through HUNDREDS of boxes.  For the first month alone you use 10-12 diapers per day.  If you formula feed, you will spend $20+ per can, and use a few cans a month, and as the baby gets older, that only increases.  Baby food is almost $1 per jar now, and once the baby is 4 months +, you will use 1-3 jars per day.  Clothing is not cheap either.  You also have a car seat, stroller, bibs, blankets, cribs, swings, books, toys, swaddlers.  You better apply for some Medicaid assistance as well as for WIC so your girlfriend and baby can get the proper nutrition.  Why is this becoming more common that babies are WANTING to have babies?  What is going wrong?|`|1QLp7iC5aa	Wow. You shouldnt have planned for this until you were at least 18 and could hope to support this baby. On another note, at least you care enough to worry about how to tell your parents, I would tell them with your girlfriend there ( alot less likely that they will throw things or become violent) babies cost a crap ton of money my husband makes almost 70,000 a year and we are still having a hard time on some months and we are in our 20's!!! One or both of you is going to have to drop out of school and work full time. The stay in the hospital after she has the baby (assuming theres no complications ) is going to be like 1200 minimum. Does she even have insurance? Will her parents let her stay on theirs? Have you guys thought about adoption?|`|w0eRRsoVaa	You planned this!?!  Holy judas!  Well, welcome to adulthood, you're going to miss out on a lot of your childhood and young adulthood like parties, trips overseas, trips around the country.  Start applying for jobs hun.  It's going to cost a helluva lot of money to raise and support a child.      Go down to Target or WalMart and look at the cost of diapers, the kid is going to go through them like it's going out of style.  Look at the cost of clothes, blankets, Dreft (laundry detergent for baby items), teething rings, formula (they go through that like it's cool), bottles, baby food, socks, jackets, shoes, strollers, diaper bags, car seats, play pens, bassinets, cribs, sippy cups, toys.      As for telling your parents.  Mom, Dad, I knocked up my gf and it was planned.  Obviously it's water under the bridge now but the very fact that you are now questioning how much it would cost to have a kid after you've already knocked her up shows how irresponsible you truly are and why you shouldn't have gotten her pregnant in the first place.|`|PN7ELn3aaa	You made a really bad decision, your life is going to be really hard. But since the damage is done, I wish you the best with your little one.    1.) Be upfront and responsible and just tell them.   2.) Hopefully her parents have insurance that will cover her prenatal care. Ask them about it. If not you should start filling out papers for Medicare. You will need insurance.  3.) I don't personally want to scare you, but walk down a baby aisle at a grocery store. Formula, if you choose to use it, is near $20 dollars a can. Diapers are around $15-20 a box.     It will be tens of thousands of dollars a year (especially the first, when you stock up and supply yourself). Get a job now. You can bag groceries at 15.    Also, garage sales and second hand stores will be your best friend for baby furniture and gear.     Good luck|`|X2G8EHBlaa	I would go to your guidance counselor at school and have them call both of your parents and her parents.  You both sit down and tell them then explain how you both feel.  The cost of having a baby and raising the child is very expensive. Its over 2,0000 just to hae the baby at the hospital.  Diapers are $20 a box-usaully a hundred -will usually last 2 weeks.  Plus formula is $15 a can sometimes more-if she's not going to breast feed plus day care while you two finish school.  go apply for a job at Kroger because your going to need money to support this baby that you two so called"planned for"   I honestly dont think you two took into consideration what it takes to raise a baby...maybe you should have took the class that makes you take home plastic babies that cry all dam night ....cause then you would have thought twice about it...that doesn't even include the money you will constantly need to give the baby what he or she needs.|`|RvddYKqjaa	You are not responsible, whether you want to hear this or not. Neither of you is responsible.   Because of your selfishness/carelessness, your parents are on the hook for your expenses. How nice of you to think of yourself first. I would tell them in a hurry. You have changed their lives and your lives forever.   I really hope it was worth it.|`|uQoBeM0Xaa	It costs a looooot your parents have to pay cause you dont have a job. Youre done for.|`|c8231f1c2871ecc3f6adf7b7e74dde8baa	Give them a card    Diapers- parents choice a box of 100 for 13 dollars  Formula- 150 for like 8 cans  Wipes- parents choice a box of like 10 packs 7 dollars  Clothes- 20 a month    ...so roughly 200 a month if you don't have WIC (it pays for the formula) but 40 if you have WIC|`|sEihaeLNaa	just say sorry me and my gf did something stupid and now shes preggo. They just said in the news tht it cost 500grand a year to care for a baby|`|qI9VCuhZaa	If you wanted to have a baby and this thing was "planned" you probably should have thought out the part where your parents have to sacrifice and hurt because of your stupid *** decision...|`|GjuRYsITaa	your 15 and you want a baby your either very stupid or haven't got a clue what your letting your self's in for babies are not dollies you know they take a lit of work and luv and financial support have you figured that one out how the hell are you going to be able to support a baby|`|Ym90xu59aa	You said that you and she "decided" that she will not have an abortion...    But then you say it was planned...    Geesh...you can't even lie right.     So, before this "planned" pregnancy, you never considered the costs?     Yeah, sounds real responsible.     Someone needs to slap you on the back of your head.|`|DutTBV3caa	wait are you saying you planned on having a baby at 15? thats crazy. you have no way of supporting yourself, your baby or the babys mother.   your parents are gonna kill you.   i'm 20yrs old and married and i just found out i'm pregnant and we're gonna have trouble supporting it so i can only imagine how much trouble you'll have.    anyways.. babys cost a lost. just come out and tell your parents. its good that you dont want an abortion but you should talk to your girlfriend about maybe adoption or to your parents about helping you out until youre old enough to work..|`|IA5zVfk0aa	well congratualations! lol :) go into your house together and have a talk with your parents... if you have insurance the dr. wont be that much  diapers for a huge  box is about 10 dollars.. but ebay has a lot of things, i just bought my baby 200 pieces of clothes for 50 bucks.. good luck! and congrats again :)|`|2KY15bnWaa	First off - good job on not going for the abortion route. Don't tell them you planned for this, even if you did. Just be blunt. Say Mom, Dad, I need to talk to you; and ask that you don't get mad. Then sit down, tell them how you're feeling. Like you could say, "I'm nervous, and I've had trouble earning up the courage to tell you guys this. But...Lizzie or Annie or whatever her name is...is pregnant. We've decided to keep the baby - and not do an abortion. I ask that would support me in my decision." How much it would cost? Think of your costs of living now doubling. Maybe even a little more with hospital bills and diapers. You are a human, and you have to take care of another human now. Thumbs up big time for not leaving the girl to do this on her own. BIG THUMBS UP! Dude, you need to stick by her side.|`|10mOwk0Taa	Its very important that you both sit down with each of your parents and explain to them the situation.  She's going to need a lot of care and special attention to get through this so you'll need the support of her parents and yours.  They might be mad at first, but they'll come around.      Also, as for the cost, the prenatal and birthing process (without insurance)  could easily cost upwards of $10,000 dollars.  If she does have insurance, it'll cost whatever her deductible and out of pocket requirement is (for instance, my total deductible is $2500, and then I have a $2500 out of pocket requirement...once I meet my deductible I have to pay 25% of all fees until i meet another $2500, bringing it to $5000 total to have the baby).  As for diapers and formula, it costs a bit, but you can do it cheap by shopping in the right places, like costco, target or walmart.  I'd say about $5000 per year for all the costs of the baby (not including vaccination shots and doctor visits).|`|8f6fff32b0caffa89ef6b762f487ae26aa	Depends on where you live..?  If you move to MA..its free..or NY..|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	A total pregnancy from beginning to end costs anywhere from 10,000-20,000 dollars without insurance for the medical expenses. I would suggest she speak to her parents asap and apply for medicaid. They will cover her pregnancy related medical expenses if she qualifies. She can apply for WIC which will supply her with formula for the baby. I was 16 when I had my first son 13 yrs ago. They wouldn't accept me for medicaid and Wic bc my parents made too much money and they take the entire households income into consideration. I don't know if they still do that or not. She will have to apply and see. It takes a while though so she should do it right away. As far as diapers and other things, those will be your guys' responsibility. Actually your parents will have the joy of all that bc neither of you have any money bc you can't get a job. I would suggest doing any kind of work you can do to earn money now and as soon as you turn 16 get a real job. Good Luck!    Wait a minue..I just re read your question. YOU PLANNED THIS??? My God..what is wrong with you? You aren't even old enough to make any money. Your parents are going to have to pay for all of this until you can get a job. I GAURANTEE this isn't the girl you will spend the rest of your life with, so when the two of you break up, and she sues you for child support. It will be your parents that have to pay that until you can get a job. You will have child support obligation for the next 21 years of your life. This happening on accident is one thing, but for you to purposely put these responsibilities on your parents is immature and inconsiderate.|`|0XaBIomCaa	Wow... 15 years old and you planned this?? You two have got to be the two biggest idiots in the world.  Can either of you even work? Besides at Mcdonalds i mean? Because that's not gonna do you alot of good when you have to py thousands and thousands for that baby.  How about this.. " Mom, Dad, me and my girlfriend intentionally got pregnant and figured that you'd pick up the tab since we don't make enough (or any) money. Thanks.. I'll send you the bill.  Do you know what the chances of two 15 year olds staying together are under good circumstances?  Not very high. and you just made it damn near impossible.  Congrats|`|uoNgB7Kmaa	Each child costs about $10,000 a year? How much is your allowance? I hope that covers it... oh wait.. don't worry. We "taxpaying, good Americans" will pay for you :)    Do you realize how dense you two are for PLANNING a teen pregnancy.   You could probably buy your mom a cake and balloons that say "congrats, you're going to be raising another child".
AA12221556	Thats great.  A good place for women to release stress!  What better way then to chat w/ women that have the same issues.    I would make chat rooms on various issues.

YhjFiVGyaa	implantation bleeding is what it is. normally you might see this kind of blood a few days before your period starts as some old tissue from last month kinda pools in the bottom there, but 4 dpo? nah.  hearthburn is a good sign of pregnancy ... in fact, digestive problems that seem to have come outta nowhere are very good indicators.  i dont get heartburn EVER or poopy issues, yet when im pregnant, i have constipation, then the runs, then constipation again, then hearthburn, then comes the pukes.    another sign would be, is there a little cramping with some aches in ur lower back and legs? is your mouth more watery than ever? have u been feeling tired and are waking up in the night more?     I ovulated in January on the 26th and on the 31st, I found like 3 spots of that brownish pinkish stuff on my toilet paper and had some pretty achy cramps that went away the nexy day along with the 'blood'. I am not due for my period til feb 8th so it wasnt anything period related. im sure i implanted that day.    also, dont start testing like crazy and get all disappointed if it comes out negative at first. this happens to all of us women as each woman is different. it takes some women only a few days after implantation to see a postive while others wont see until after they miss a period and even longer! with my prior pregnancies, them tests never came out until i was in the end of my first month...and im going thru it again now. i know im pregnant, i know my body...i am 10 dpo and no positive...im sure if i test in another week, that line will be there.    in 7 days it still may be too soon as u will only be 10-11 dpo...only 10% of pregnancies are confirmed with an accurate positive (meaning no false negatives) at this period.  so even if u use those 5 days sooner tests, they really hardly work. i have seen women use the expensive first response 5 days early and get a negative, only to later that day buy a dollar store cheapy and get their positive!  and blood tests arent always the ones that pick up the hcg better.    my last pregnancy, i tested at 12dpo and got a negative threw the test away and got an evaporation line later. turns out i was pregnant but the test sure as hell didnt pick it up.|`|yznZqcznaa	Going for swabs?  What is that?  I have not heard that before.  When I found out I was pregnant I honestly was not expecting to be pregnant.  I had no symptoms other then sore boobs.  The boobs should have been a clear sign since I have never had them before.  Not even with my last 2 pregnancies that ended in a MC.  So you never know.  Sometimes people get symptoms right away and sometimes it takes a while.  My sore boobs started a whole week before my period was due.  3 or 4 days after that started I got a positive pregnancy test.  Just be patient, that 2WW is the worst.|`|3CG3rby0aa	what was your question again?  sorry i just didn't see one.
gwuTKiNXaa	well your chance are still good of getting pregnant either way if you had sex around your ovulation time
9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	I kinda agree with you.  I believe that if you don't work, get welfare or other government handouts - you should be put on the pill and not be given any extra money if you do get pregnant.   I bet that would stop a lot of these babies from popping out.  Cut out that extra money!|`|AA11210211	lol boy you just have it all planned out don't you,No I don't think that it should go that way,more than Half the population isn't rich so because we aren't rich means we can't have children??|`|vcNvEIOwaa	this is a very self centered view with no morals or common sense whatsoever. God said to multiply the earth, he never said when to stop or how many should be born to any given family. The poor were never ridiculed by Jesus himself but were held very dear by him. This view is very wicked and will be the end of you.|`|fYT2kOhqaa	Hell yeah!  There are already enough children out there that need homes.|`|AA10186411	Thank God you are a person of no power.  You have no right to tell someone they can't have kids.  Maybe it would have been better if your parents decided not to have any.|`|r39EDGhPaa	I just think there should be a parenting license or something.  Any crack whore can have kids, and people have tons of children so that they can get welfare.  I think that the only people who should be allowed to have children are the people who can prove to be good parents.  I don't think people should stop having children all together because of how little money they make.     I refuse to think of bearing children as a "right".  It should be thought of as a privilege.. and [some] people take advantage of it.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	I do not agree with you  about only rich should have children but what i do think is that the crack mothers having 15 kids whom all get taken away or killed should not be having children|`|4NcshCDvaa	We are not overpopulated....that is a bunch of crap. In the US we are going to be underpopulated when our this generation dies we will probably have less people because the average couple only has two children...That means those two people have someone to fill their spot when they die...but what about all of those who have just one child or all of those who have no children or are single. And not to mention the childhood or teen death rate...
Y8kjVeLyaa	I think that Mothers or Father should be there to take and collect their children to and from school/....kids are spending 12 hours a day in some cases, in breakfast clubs and after school care...they have no quality time with their own family....except the weekends...not enough...our children need to be with their parents FAR more...I favour the idea of a 4 day school week...so children can have an education combined with a childhood.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Your choice completely.  I opted to return to to work part time when my daughter was 3, and have been working only part time ever since.  It's what works for our family.      You do what works for YOUR family.|`|Btsctjydaa	Go shopping with me, girlfiend!!!|`|68c6B8dRaa	I _assumed_ working after school age starts, but I admit now I'm unclear on how that works. I will still have a boatload of stuff to do around the house, still have a child who needs three meals a day, and there aren't a lot of full-time jobs that run the same hours as school, so what happens for the last few hours of the day?    My mother was a permanent SAHM and I think my siblings and I benefitted a fair bit from that. Other kids went home and made themselves Kraft Dinner and watched soap operas; we had homemade muffins and arts and crafts...|`|8DnIXwnyaa	I stay home with my 15 month old and watch 2 other boys for extra money.  I'm having another baby in May and when they start school I think i'll get a job as a substitute teacher.  i have a BS in Elem Edu.  but I think a regular teacher has so many after school hour committments.  Plus as a sub i can do field trips and such in the boys classes without missing a scheduled day.    I think it is fine whatever you decide.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i'm an army wife. i'm going to be traveling all over and i don't know if i'll be able to get a job in some places.  i think if you're going to school when she is going to school, that is fine. if she is going to school and you're just sitting at home on your butt all day watching soap operas, then you need job for sure!|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	If they can afford to stay at home, great, if they are claiming state benefits, sorry but no, they should go to work like the rest of us have to.

I think if you're on benefits you should look for something part-time. But if your family finances allow you to stay home, and you are comfortable doing it, then I don't see why you shouldn't.  I haven't yet thought too much about what I'll be doing then - I might look for something part-time, but I might not.

Although I stay at home for now because I have two babies and refuse to put the in daycare at such a young age. When they are old enough to talk and I feel comfortable in putting them in day care I will go back to work for sure.

Myself, once my kids are in school, I will work again but will be home to take to and from school.  Just something part time to keep busy and make some extra money.  I would be too bored at home alone all day and really at that age when they kids start school, they are alot easier to care for.  So normal cleaning and cooking and such wont be a challenge after work.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	My kids are 9 and 7, I`m home talking to you.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	I think it is a personal choice.   I'd be bored, but that's just me.|`|qr8yxOBfaa	I think that is a choice for you and your husband to decide.  If you feel like you are ready to join the workforce again by all means go on and get a job.  But if you are not ready dint rush it , it will come to you.

I will say that the title SAHM needs to be removed.  IMO, a SAHM is a person who stays home to take care of children.  And well, if there are no children at home during the working hours, the title is not appropriate.  I stay at home and watch my child and will continue to until he is in school.  I personally don't like SAHM as a title.  I just tell people, I don't work - I stay home and raise my child.  As tedious as it is, I don't think being a mom is a JOB -  it is a choice that I made.|`|9592bded904251682087b9c798633c9baa	in the first place, it is your personal choice. If you want to go to work you should teach your child how to make some food when she comes home and mom is not there. And maybe you should teach her not to do anything wrong like burning up the house while you're away :).    If you want to be a stay at home mum, it will be okay as well and accepted by most people. A mother who always waits for her child to come home proves much love. Of course, working mum do love their children as well as non-working mums (please, don't have a go at me for my previous sentence). Anyway, make your choice. None of your choices can be wrong. I am sure, you will always be a good loving mother.|`|1SGl03Zlaa	I think if you can afford to stay home and you aren't bored with it why not?  Just because the kids are in school doesn't mean that there isn't still work to be done around the house.  Being a homemaker can be a full time job especially if the parent staying home is the only one doing the cleaning and cooking.  My sister plan on staying home once her children are all in school, her mother in law stayed home until all her kids were in high school and old enough to be home alone after school.  It not always easy to find a job that will work around your kids school schedule.  Personally I would like to go back to school myself as well once my children are in school full time.|`|ta8pa4o1aa	Each to their own...    if you want to stay at home and are financially able to, then why not!!!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	If you can finacially afford to stay home then I think there is nothing wrong with it.    I plan on staying home if we can afford it at that point.  That way I will be able to keep a perfect home, have a excellent dinner cooked for my family, pack lunches with care, keep up on everything easily, and by the time my children are home from school, I will be able to spend time doing homework with them and spending time with them and be refreshed instead of being too tired or too busy catching up on housework because I was at work all day.   Not bashing mothers who work, more power to ya, its got to be hard, I just think there is nothing wrong with staying home either.
5DJcir9saa	For some women, contractions aren't as strong as others.  So she should have worded like " for me, the contractions were only as bad as bad cramps" because there are some women out there who have horrible contractions and men already can't understand what they feel like!  So when a woman makes it out like they feel the same way for everyone, it does discredit women everywhere!|`|MNxxD0h2aa	Yes thanks...also could you please be fat and saggy for awhile afterward instead of swimsuit ready in a week!?|`|0QYIbn1saa	That reminds me of a documentary i saw a few months ago, where women were having natural births at home and there were a handful of them that claimed to be having an orgasm while giving birth.

d6e11chxaa	I think it's a cool nickname for Donovan, but not as a given name. It's like Car: it works as a nickname for Carson, but sounds ridiculous as a given name.    Vander seems a bit short as a given name. I think Evander makes a much better choice. It's an ancient Roman name; so it's familiar, historic, and strong, but very unusual.|`|AA11210211	At one time my initials were VAN and some of my friends called me van,It's okay I wouldn't personally pick it as a first name though.|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	never seen it, but I dont like the name, its weird.|`|7c47435ed764615f7c9efed94837c93faa	I think it is cute!  I am thinking of Vaughn for my boy.    And I just looked it up.  Van is short for Ivan (Van Morrison)|`|nkM6wmv6aa	not much|`|w0eRRsoVaa	It's not bad but eh.  Vance would be the long form.  Van makes think of Van Morrison, Van Helsing, the vehicle, etc.|`|qitXGd0qaa	Van could be a nickname for:  Evan  Ivan  Stevan  Vance  Devan    Vander is o.k. but kind of weird, sounds like its missing something.|`|a0b83986209c3ad9a015c92f044e983eaa	PLEASE DONT DO THAT|`|9CAXUgOZaa	I actually really love the name Van.   I wouldn't use it for any of my kids, but I like the name.     I think it can just be a name on its own. I know of a Vincent, who goes by Van as well.    :)|`|9Jnf5jRQaa	what about Vance?|`|5WYeHh0paa	i love reba and I actually thought it was a cute name.  considered it for my child.|`|fazWgkePaa	I like the name...but Im not too sure if I like it because I like his character on the show, or if I like it as a real name.|`|Zrz9KHISaa	how about Val short for Valerie|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I actually like it.And there will not many boys with that name in his class.|`|wHOQXToHaa	I like unique names, but Van is a little bit much for me.....|`|AA10154698	One of my best friends is named Vann spelled with 2 n's|`|NzFPFqaCaa	I've never cared for the name|`|08kH822qaa	How about Vance or Vaughn instead of just Van.|`|Wnmg850Paa	Like Van Morrison, though I don't think that is his real name. I really like it. It's different, almost sounds like a cowboy or bull ride, tough.|`|UDnzvjCeaa	What about Truck or Car?
AA12225859	I didn't ever feel barfy either.  At first, before I took a positive test, I had a weird tingey pain on my right lower ab and kinda down lower..hard to explain.  When I told someone about that cramping they said to take a test.  I had taken one already with a negative so i was worried it was something else.  I woke up one morning to that pain again (It was not a terrible pain, just annoying) so I took a test and it was positive..that was about a week after the last one.|`|gwuTKiNXaa	I would say that it is to early to test I would just wait until the 10th to see if it comes and if you still can't wait a couple of days after then test then|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	My suggestion is to wait till you've DEFINITELY missed your period.  I normally take a test on the day of my missed period and then a few days after.  =)  I hope your pregnant this round!!!  I'd be so happy for you!
8t8NjjnVaa	It's obvious that there are some people who shouldn't have kids at all, let alone cosleep.      Cosleeping can be dangerous IF:  the parents smoke, the parents use drugs/alcohol, the parents are quite overweight, the parents are known to be heavy sleepers, or the parents are known to kick, punch, or otherwise thrash about in their sleep.    But as long as those things don't apply and you are doing it safely (no heavy blankets, no waterbed, something to keep the baby from rolling off the bed, etc), then I don't see it as a danger.    In fact, there are some studies that show a decreased risk of SIDS for cosleeping babies.    For that particular article, it's obvious that the parents were negligent.  If they don't have enough sense to not cook up meth in their house, then they obviously don't have enough sense to cosleep safely.    By the way, I coslept with both my kids and transitioned them into their own beds in their own rooms at two years old with no tears and no stress.  The people that say that you'll never get the baby out if you sleep with them are obviously not very bright.  It's quite easy to get a kid to sleep on their own when they are old enough to understand what you are saying.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	I think co-sleeping is wonderful when done correctly.  It's sad when parents don't take every precaution to care for their children but it does happen.  And unfortunately, many times people (media) only point out what they think is important (the baby suffocated while co-sleeping) rather than telling the full story (there were other risk factors involved).|`|AA11210211	I have heard numerous stories from the nurses at my OBGYN clinic about parents who have co-slept and ended up suffocating their baby while they were not intoxicated,I co-slept with my son for about 3 weeks until the nurses told me the stories and after that I put him in his bedside sleeper,The way I see it is they do make bedside sleepers that allow you to get to your baby easily so why risk it??Sure you may think that you would or could never do that but stuff happens and you never know.|`|M5E3mDBJaa	I also have never heard of a case where a baby has been crushed during co-sleeping that has been totally innocent (hasn't involved medical conditions or drugs/alcohol).  I don't really have a strong opinion on the issue of co-sleeping.  Personally, I couldn't do it because I am a light sleeper and I think the awareness that she is right there would prevent me from getting the good quality sleep necessary in order to have the energy to parent her.  I don't tell others they can't do it though because it's none of my business.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I co-sleep as did my mom with all of us.  Many other cultures do it as well and have lower SIDS rates. When it's done properly it's perfectly safe. It's not safe when: mom is drugged up in any way, on a couch, on a soft bed, with an extremely overweight mom, between mom and dad, or with lots of blankets and pillows.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	this amkes me mad.it amkes people worry so much. co-sleeping is fine for people who aren't heavy sleepers, on drugs, aren't drinking or smoking. most of these cases reported are from drug abusers     my son is 22 months and still in bed with me- if anything he is suffocating me. more babies die in their own bed than in bed with their parents. my niece HAS to sleep with my sister while she si sick because she gets apnea and my sister has to wake her to breath. if she wasn't in bed with my sister imagin what would happen|`|zwctZ812aa	I think co-sleeping is great for both baby and parents.  It helps everyone sleep better and I love having my son right there.  I agree...I'm never really sleeping with my son in the bed.  Every little thing wakes me up and I am confident I would never roll onto him.  Just to be safe, when my boyfriend goes out drinking he sleeps on the couch because I'm afraid he would fall into too deep of a sleep and crush the baby, but on a normal basis, I'm totally comfortable with it.  IMO, there's no safer place for my son than right next to me.|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	I think co-sleeping is safe and wonderful. It's sad when a parent doesn't take the necessary precautions when co-sleeping, such as abstaining from drugs and alcohol, and has a tragic result.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	My cousin was suffocated with co sleeping.  My aunt was totally sober at the time. Just rolled over in her sleep|`|wKYdIaZVaa	I've known many people who co-sleep with their children. I sometimes also do it if Chloe is having a difficult night. However, I don't sleep well when she's in bed with us. I wake up constantly to check that she's okay or that my boyfriend hasn't accidentally rolled over on her. Yeah, I'm paranoid, even though my boyfriend sleeps just as lightly as I do when she's in our bed.  This is why we prefer for her to sleep in her crib.     I don't have any negative things to people who decide to co-sleep. Their child, their choice!|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	The recommendations for safe co-sleeping usually indicate that co-sleeping is safe when:     The baby is between the mother and a wall  The parents are not overweight  The parents are not under the influence of drugs/alcohol/certain medications  Blankets/pillows are kept to a minimum    This is just from what I have read and how we co-sleep safely.|`|UghJ0XROaa	I kind of co sleep with my youngest. My husband leaves for work around 5 in the morning and my daughter wakes up around 4:30, i guess to tell daddy bye. But i take her back to bed with me to nurse, honestly, it's not going good for us. She sleeps so horribly with someone else. I did the same thing with my oldest when she was a baby and she did wonderful for those couple of hours a night, but she would sleep anywhere.     My husband and I can't really co sleep because we are both overweight and it's just not a good idea. I think it's a beautiful thing if it works for you and your family, there are risks, but at the same time there are risks in a crib, so do what needs to be done for your family.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	I think it was because of the drugs and or liquor. I don't sleep with my kids but I did when we were still in the hospital and on some occasions where it was necessary (when my son has rsv) I could always tell where they were even from the 1st day. Just like you normally don't roll off your bed unless your drunk. Same thing. I pray for babies out there. God bless that little one. That is awful.|`|6XSOVAh0aa	I don't do it, but that's my choice.  Once in a while we let her come into bed with us if she's having a hard night.  My brother and his wife did this and their kids are still in bed with them.  One is 5 and one will be 3.  Neither one can sleep in their own bed because they are so used to being there.  I think my brother sleeps on the couch most nights.  I don't think that side of it is good, at all.|`|68c6B8dRaa	Write a letter to the editor. I did when co-sleeping bullsh!t showed up in my local paper. Viz: http://www2.canada.com/ottawacitizen/vie...|`|YsnY9LqIaa	I've never known anyone who actually knows the person it's supposedly happened to - it's always a friend of a friend of a friend etc.  I have co-slept with my little one for almost 17 months and have never come close to rolling on her.  People don't roll out of bed every night do they?  Just because people are sleeping, doesn't mean they can't still be concious of things.  I think co-sleeping is great til baby is sleeping through/happy in their own bed - too much emphasis is put on forcing them into it, mistakenly believing it will foster independance.|`|VKgD1K3baa	I recently read an article in our local paper discussing co-sleeping and how it's "dangerous". My opinion, it's not for everyone. I am a light sleeper and wake to my baby's every move, but if you are a heavy sleeper and/or using drugs or alcohol, then I would abstain from it.    ADD: I am a big fan of Dr. Sears and love his research/ideas on co-sleeping http://www.askdrsears.com/html/7/T071000...|`|ShJsLezOaa	I co-slept with both my children, and in fact my daughter had such bad acid reflux and colic that she slept on my chest with me sitting up for the first month. I was very aware of any movement and I was never in a deep sleep because I had a strong mother instinct going on. But, if someone is a deep sleeper or known for tossing and turning, probably not a good idea. I think as parents we need to use our own judgments. If people are doing drugs, then they obviously don't have good judgment anyway and shouldn't even have their children in custody let alone sleep with them.|`|rjVALevtaa	Personally, I'm against it. There are many parents that enjoy co-sleeping and that's fine. But there is always the risk that you could roll over on the baby, or the baby could pull a blanket over his head...it's just not worth the risk to me.    When our youngest was a newborn I put him in the bed with us a few times because I was just dead tired. I had to stop though because my husband was so afraid that he would roll over on him that he couldn't sleep.     It's a personal choice, really. But I think that a bassinet in your bedroom (which is what we did) or one of those co-sleeping beds that attach to the adult bed are much safer options.|`|0MhJOP6xaa	i can see why mothers want to do it especially If you are breast feeding , but I think the baby doesn't gain anything from the experience and suffers when you try to stop and introduce the cot, therefore I think it is an entirely selfish thing to do, as it is only for the mothers benefit. i have a nine month old who loves her cot and sleeps all night in it, but I will admit I was tempted by the whole co-sleepong thing when I was doing night feeds, but I resisted.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	My daughter turned 6 months this past week and we co-slept until about three weeks ago.  I hear you about knowing where she was at all times.  Even though she is waking up 2-3 times a night with her teething now, I know I'm sleeping better with her in her crib.  It's not that I don't want to sleep with her, it's just that she's starting to roll around in her sleep and want to play, so I thought it was better for all of us for her to transition into her crib.  I would easily wake up at every little movement and sound that she made and I loved it!  I wish I had known how much I was going to love co-sleeping because I really thought she would be in her room from day 1.  I wouldn't change the last few months for the world and will definitely do this with any other children I have.    I think if you know the correct way of doing it and you don't drink or do drugs, than it's perfectly fine.  People definitely looked down on me for it but I would just tell them that it works for us.  People get entirely too hung up on what other people do and don't spend enough time worrying about themselves.  It's a shame what happened in your neighborhood but it's from drugs, not co-sleeping and it's a shame that the paper doesn't report on both sides of this issue.|`|KYphLHNNaa	I also know of two people this happened too and they were sober, just fell asleep and woke up to a "blue" baby...its not a good idea. And why start them in that habbit once they are a toddler they will never want to sleep on their own.|`|umGzyElZaa	My husband is a police officer, and sees it all the time! Its really sad. Parents you would NEVER expect to allow it to happen. I wouldn't say that most cases involve drugs/alcohol. Its just parents wanting to be close to thier child, and just don't realize that they have rolled over on them throughout the night, or pulled the covers over thier head!    A lot of the time its mistaken for SIDS...there have even been times when the officer hasn't had the heart to tell the parent that they suffocated them..just let them think it was SIDS.    I don't allow our son to sleep with us unless its just one of us in the bed with him that way there is plenty of space. But, that's because I want him to get used to his crib, being on his own. I slept with my parents for WAY TOO LONG! I just wouldn't sleep on my own. So, I suppose I just have a fear of that happening.     I have mixed feelings about it. You NEVER know what could happen. I think if your going to do it, its probably smart to use one of those "beds" designed for the baby to sleep in your bed...that way, just in case, they are protected. I say better safe than sorry, its your child's life. My son always slept in a bassinet beside our bed, and started sleeping in his room, in his crib at 2 months. He goes right to sleep when we lay him down, its wonderful!    So I guess I would have to say that I am mostly against it if theres not PLENTY of room. My sons life is too important for me to just trust that I wont ever let that happen...? With 2 people in the bed, that just seems too close!|`|1SGl03Zlaa	I co slept with my daughter for 14 months.  I've never felt there were any issues about safety though.  We put our mattress on the floor just in case she rolled off and we never slept with her if one of us was intoxicated (of course we would never both drink if she was home anyways).  Even if my husband only drank a beer or two before bed I would make him sleep on the couch.  I think as long as you use common sense and follow a few safety guidelines it is perfectly safe.
oYSsVM0Aaa	No. I have already been trying for a year with no luck, so there's no way I'm going to hold off until the recession's "over" because I don't want to see myself at 37 years old going "There, ok they economy's better but now I have been trying for two years and I'm still not pregnant".    I will find a way to get by on tough times. Too many people these days live beyond their means. My mom hand washed cloth diapers, made our own play-dough out of flour and food colouring, knew how to stretch a dollar, used a little collapsable umbrella-stroller... Instead, moms these days spend a fortune on big strollers with cup holders and send their kids to $600-a-month daycare.    edit: Wow, Em (below me) that is the rudest thing ever :/|`|TrBoPj92aa	i fell pregant january 08 and i now have beautiful 5month old twins who are costing are fortune thanks to the stupid recession!!

xzh8r0jIaa	i would be concerned especially with any new and sudden swelling like that, and i think with you eyelids that is kinda excessive for swelling in the face, defiantly call you dr to get your blood and urine tested for pre eclampsia.    tword the end of pregnancy is when its more  of a concern and serious problem so just n case call your dr|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I would be concerned considering you have swelling elsewhere and have had high blood pressure. Call your doctor's office and speak with the nurse, they will most likely want you to come in.    Seriously, make sure you call. Pre-eclampsia can be very serious if left untreated. The only treatment is delivery, by the way :)|`|fXzed3fLaa	Call your Dr. now!  They will probably tell you to come in. Google Pre eclampsia
TrTfAtAwaa	I was so excited to finally go ino labor! It seemed ike i was constantly trying to feel" contractions" that werent there.  I was 3 days past my due date and  crushed! I planned to get induced about 5 days after my due date. Ended up feeling contracions when i woke up 3 days after my due date. They were very light and not painful, but of course i rushed to the hospital. Ended having her that night.  You could go into labor 2 weeks early.or she could disapoint you and make you wait until after your due date. No way in telling.  good luck though!|`|hJoB7VR1aa	I was 37 wks, it was 1am and I was just getting to bed. I had a very long day and was so tired, just as I was getting in the bed my water broke. I thought to myself, "This can't be happening now, I'm so tired." I went to the hospital and they hooked me up to all the machines and started my IV, I wasn't in labor, my water just broke. They let me sleep until 9am and then started pitocin. I started labor at 11am and had her at 5:15 pm.    Good Luck and hope you get lots of rest before the big day.|`|LrHPqW0aaa	My first I just got done rearranging my room and took a bath, shaved my legs just in case.  After the bath I went pee and noticed white and pink stuff in the toilet.  Every one else was sleeping that I lived with, I woke up my auntie and told her that I thought my water broke, my cousin who is a hard sleeper since they where both sleeping in the living room jumped up so fast and said WHAT? We called the family of the babies dad and told them to meet us at the hospital.  The hospital is about 20 miles away form where we live. On the way up there, the aunt of my son and her boyfriend passed us. We had to flash them and let them know that we are not there yet.  Labor was 19 hours, 11 hours into it they had to induce me because I was still dilated to 3cm..  I had a 9lb 11oz. baby boy, natural. He was a day early.  My second I cleaned the whole house, and was about done making dinner, when taking dinner out of the oven I noticed I was having hard Intense contractions that I couldn't handle.  At that time my first son was almost 2 we had my boyfriends uncle staying with us I went into the living room and asked him to watch my son for me and that I thought I was in labor.  We had no phone at our house, so I had to walk over to my aunties house, the one who I lived with before.  I almost couldn't walk that far, 4 houses away, a cousin of mine saw me walking as I got to my aunts drive way and asked if I needed her to get my in-laws I told her yes.  My second son I was in labor for 4 1/2 hours, I thought it was going to be as long as my first, so I asked for drugs because the contractions where so Intense.  The Dr. said let me check you to see how far along you are.  When she checked me she told me I was ready to push.  So no drugs for my second birth.  My 2nd son was 9lbs. 3.2oz, natural birth. He was 10 days early.  Now I'm 33 weeks pregnant with My 3rd son, and He looks to be about the same weight as my other 2 if I go full term with Him, I hope he'll be natural too.|`|P2hhUsoMaa	My first pregnancy my water broke in the shower at 36 weeks.

YFPMcHCbaa	None of the people on here will be able to tell you if you're pregnant. All the symptoms you get during pregnancy can also be associated with something else.    Take a test, or do some research. There are so many different places to get great information on the web.    babycenter.com  pregnancy.org  pregnancy.com  americanpregnancy.org  webmd.com/baby  pregnancy360.com  fitpregnancy.com  surebaby.com  pregnancytoday.com  pregnancy-calendars.org|`|FCcbgriuaa	I got pregnant by skipping the pill once when i was younger! You could definitely end up prego! I would test when the time comes.|`|lRtEjRNxaa	i dont think your pregnancy chances are very high, however everything is possible. Do NOT skip the pills unless you're trying to be pregnant.|`|0722e5ddd4c6c3cb4e310338f3c85935aa	You can still get pregnant. Missing two or more throws off the reliability of the pill and can cause you to get your period. Especially since a normal cycle is 28 days so the 14th day after you started you would ovulate. Even if you do not get pregnant your period may be off because of confusing your body by going on the pill then off etc... after doing this there is noting to do but wait and see... good luck
3a51e28548b4dfaef611cd3cec8feb0aaa	cloudy urine can mean you have a urinary tract infection, it can mean you aren't drinking enough water, there are multiple things cloudy urine can mean but it just because your urine is cloudy doesn't mean you are pregnant. No, it will not alter a pregnancy test. If you think you are pregnant you should go to the doctor and be tested.
vue9NOhYaa	Is he showing signs of readiness and interest?  26 months is still a bit on the early side, so unless he IS acting ready/interested, your probably better off waiting a while.      When you do decide, just tell the sitter what you're doing.  She will work with you and support whatever method you decide on. (I used to work at a preschool, and we had many potty training kids.)    My daughter trained at around 32 months.  I used 'naked training'.  We had a few days when she had no-where to go (she wasn't in daycare, but did have a lot of activities) and I just stripped her bare (it was summer, and we have hardwood floors -- if you have carpets, wait until summer and do it outside in the yard [if you have one]) and had a potty handy.  Being able to see what's happening and connect it with the feeling is very helpful in helping the child understand what you're wanting him to do.|`|LeY6hx4Laa	A good sticker chart is a great way to start, even letting him help make it and explain to him what its for and that he will get a reward for using the potty. I use to let them run around in just pants no trousers (it will save the washing) and keep reminding them and sitting them on the potty lots, give lots of praise and not too much fuss if a accident happens! he will soon get the idea, good luck!|`|xzs7Dw0zaa	If your son is with the babysitter for that long, then it's important for you to have a nice long chat with the babysitter first about toilet training before either one of you try it out. Toilet traing may not happen overnight and some children resist it, taking  longer time to accept a potty. In such cases, you need more patience and persistant efforts. Since the babysitter is there with him all the time, she should be advised on the right and wrong ways of TT and also assess how much time she can devote to all this.    For detailed information on how to potty train your child, read this article on Potty training. It has everything that you might want to know.  http://www.dubaimoms.com/ArticleInfo.php...|`|ZjVJMFQ7aa	The best thing is to ascertain the time he feels/ goes for natural call.  Normally in the morning once and later when he normally feels thats the time he should be taken to potty.  If he does not want to sit then u may switch on TV / cartoon (which ever he likes) so that he can sit for a while a complete his job.  This at times work on my son.
umGzyElZaa	Oh my goodness, the last few weeks of my pregnancy were NOT fun! So I know how you feel... I did the same thing on here! haha.    One thing that was odd for me in the beg, was I woke up one morning, and my right arm was HUGE, it was purple and hurting really bad! I went to the emergency room, the checked me for blood clots. Turns out they said it was muscle strain and sent me home. I knew it wasnt muscle strain! You could see ever vein in my arm! It went away after a few days but it was just too weird!    Everything was ok for the majority of my pregnancy....    I started going in at 37 weeks to try and get my membranes stripped to get me into labor...I was huge. The first week we couldnt do it, my cervix wasnt dilated at all, she could hardly reach it. So, I went back the next week and same thing, but this time she said that she thinks I have a "narrow pelvic arch" and that I may need a c-section, scared me to DEATH! I spent the next week MISERABLE and HUGE and CONTRACTING and BALLING! I was a mess. I started getting contractions 5-mins apart that lasted for 24 hours. SO I went to the labor and delivery unit thinkin something was happening. NO...nothing. Well the nurse there had also told me that she thought I was really narrow, and her opinion was that I needed a c-section as well. I had an apt 2 days later and they wanted me to just wait and see what happens until then. UGH! SO I continued to have contractions for 2 days. But, since my son wasnt dropping because of the fact that I was too narrow, all my contractions were in my chest. It was the oddest thing. When I had one, my tummy would tighten, but I would have a lot of pressure in my chest. I thought I had gotten some kind of heart problem! Thinking back about the arm thing, I must have had something weird with that, still cant figure out what! BUT anyways, When I went into my apt, she told me that she thought I had about a 25% chance of delivering naturally. I hadnt dilated or effaced at all! Even with contracting steadily for 3 1/2 days! Just wasnt happening.    So the next morning I was rolled into the OR, and had my son at 7:50 in the morning. Funny thing was, my contractions were down to 3 mins apart that day! Still doing nothing, not even hurting me. Everyone there thought it was crazy.     So EVERYTHING will be fine. Its quite normal to get frustrated near the end! Your just miserable, and you just want your body back. Dont worry about a thing. When your holding that little miracle you will forget about all of this! However they bring your baby into this world it will be PERFECT! Congrats and hang in there...I know its hard.    ps. c-sections are amazing. :o) ...just in case!|`|3CVfUiiJaa	Mine wasn't rough per say, but I couldn't enjoy it like most pregnant women.  I am diabetic and have hypertension, so I was on injections 4 times a day and meds for my blood pressure.   I had appointments with my regular doctor every 2 weeks, and a specialist every other week..so I was going back and forth every week.  I also had ultrasounds every 3 to 4 weeks.  I was told that there could be countless things wrong with my baby because I was diabetic and I couldn't eat much of anything that I really wanted.  I was constantly worried that something would be wrong with my baby.  In the 36th week, I had a routine ultrasound where they saw complications and flew me out to have a emergency c section.  Turns out everything was fine and my son was born healthy.  I look back now and I'm glad I'm not on the needles anymore, but the thing is if I ever get pregnant again, I will have to start them again and not get to enjoy eating all the sweet foods that I wanted.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Mine was kinda rough with worrying!  At 7weeks my OB's PA called and said that they thought I miscarried, because they didn't see a heart beat.  Then at 18 weeks, they saw a cloroid plexis cyst(spelling?)  so I had to do a level 2 ultrasound, at 22 weeks, and then they saw a bright spot on the baby's heart, both of which are signs for Trisomy 18!  Then at 31 weeks I was admitted, because the I hadn't felt the baby move, only to find out she was being lazy!  I was delivered via c-section 16 days early, because they thought I had an infection! So after a long pregnancy, 9 ultrasounds, many hours of worrying, and crying, I had a beautiful healthy baby girl!  I'm sorry to hear your having a rough time, try and relax, keep your self busy, which I know is next to impossible.  Research, prepare yourself, I know sometimes getting more info on something can make you worry, but I know it helped me to be able to understand things, and know what my doc was talking about.  I hope all is well, and I'm sure you'll have a perfect little baby!  Keep your head up!!!!|`|6XSOVAh0aa	My first one seemed rough.  My urine didn't pass a couple times so I had to do more tests.  I was always swollen and it really hurt to walk because I got so big.  I was at my due date and wasn't even dilated at all.  They finally did another sonogram and found she was breech so I had to have a csection since it was way too late for them to get her to go the right way.  I ended up being 2 weeks late with a baby that was over 9 pounds.  With this one, I'm way more tired all the time and I'm pretty sick.  I'm only at 14 weeks, though, but I know I didn't start out like this last time.  At least you're almost there!  Hang in there!|`|wKYdIaZVaa	I had morning sickness for almost 7 months. Constant puking all day long. It was horrible, and many days, I couldn't keep anything down.     Other than that, there were no big scares. However, it was towards the end that things got scary fast. I was 35 weeks pregnant and my blood pressure sky-rocketed. Border line to have a stroke, my doctor decided to do an emergency c-section. When they took my daughter out, she had the cord tightly around her neck three times. My doctor told me very bluntly that I was lucky I had her when I did. Thinking back how things could have ended up so differently still gives me goosebumps.     There are many women who have troublesome pregnancies and end up with a beautiful healthy baby, and then there are others who have a worry-free one and terrible things happen. As mothers, we deal with all the stress of the "what-ifs" every day. The only thing we can do is pray that everything will turn out fine.     I only hope that you stay strong and may God protect you and your child. As stressful and hectic as it might have been, the minute you see your child for the first time, it'll all be worth it. I'm sorry to sound "preachy" but I really do believe that God doesn't give us anything that he doesn't think we can handle.     Best of Luck to you and your little one!|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I had a rough pregnancy. By 12 weeks I was on bedrest due to possible heart conditions, I had appointments constantly, and most of my doctors always seemed so negative. I stopped gaining weight around 26 weeks (and I didn't gain anything until the 23rd week) so the doctors then started yelling at me because I wasn't gainign enough weight. It was terrible, stressful, and I just wanted it to be over.    Come July 22, 2008 I had a 8lb 10oz baby girl (and to think, they told me she'd be small) She's  healthy, and God answered my prayers. Hang in there, I'll keep you in my prayers.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I had a bit of a rough pregnancy, but not as bad as some people have!    From around week 6 to week 9 I bled a few times, and had to have a scan to check everything was OK.  Thankfully it was, but it meant I never really relaxed about the pregnancy until I was quite far into it.      I'd seen my sister have an emergency c-section the year prior to my pregnancy: when she went for her 34 week scan there wasn't enough amniotic fluid and the placenta was failing.  So my niece was born that night at 2lbs 3oz, in NICU and SCBU for the next 5 weeks.  It was so scary and I was terrified the same thing would happen to me.    I had pre eclampsia developing from early on in the third trimester, and was constantly being sent into the daycare unit at the hospital to check my BP.  At the very end I ended up being induced.    I was all swollen, dizzy, and sore from SPD, I HATED the last trimester so much!  lol    BUT!  I now have the most amazing wee boy, and it was all so so so worth it!  He was born a healthy 7lbs 8oz after just under 6 hours of labour, and I totally forgot about all the crap that had to happen to get him :)|`|AA11795652	Well, my first pregnancy was fairly easy and so I expected the same with my 2nd.  I was wrong.  I was exhausted about 99% of the time during my entire pregnancy.  I didn't have a lot of complications but I barely passed my glucose test.  At 34 weeks, my son was breech, and then he turned, and then he moved back up and put his fist down, and I was afraid of having a c-section.  He finally went head down again after doing squats, getting on all fours, and walking for 3 hours at Disneyland until I could no longer move.  I was induced before he could move back up and I had a vaginal delivery.  Every pregnancy has its share of rough times and although my story may not sound so bad, the idea of having a c-section and a breech baby scared me, but I feel blessed that God answered my prayers and let me have a vaginal delivery.  I'll say a prayer for you.|`|zc9yo2ETaa	yes, i did, xD|`|955YoHvVaa	I had a lot of trouble getting pregnant I had 3 miscarriages before I got pregnant again with my daughter only to be put on bedrest at 13 weeks. I was sick all the time, I couldn't keep anything down and it was quite miserable. I violated my bedrest and decided to get up and walk downstairs to clean up and get that chocolate cake and halfway down my water broke at 29 weeks 3days. I had horrific back labor to top of this miserable pregnancy. My baby girl was born weighing 2 lbs and spent 9 weeks in the nicu..after everything I had been through to have her I wouldn't change it and I definately would do it all over again.|`|P2hhUsoMaa	I know exactly how your feeling.  With my first pregnancy I went to my first appt and then went and had bloodword done.  A few days later I got a call from the nurse saying a test came back abnormal for my baby having spina bifida.  At that point I was so scared.  They scheduled me for an emergency ultrasound the next morning.  (they should have just called me and set up an apt to tell me and do the ultrasound, calling me and telling me at home was worse)  I went for the ultrasound and was referred to a high risk doctor.  They looked everything over and said we think we are just off on your due date.  So they kept my original due date of July 26 but said my baby may be a month early.  Hmmm...Odd.  So I thought I was in the clear.  But I wasn't.  I researched the blood test that was abnormal only to find out it's a 90% false positive so I really thought it was just wrong.  I went to my next doc apt and they decided that every apt I was to go to the hospital and get an ultrasound 1st.  Which meant alot of appointments!  So I did everything as they said.  By 7 months I was having 2 apts/2ultrasounds a week.  Everything was so stressful! And at 36 weeks at my ultrasound they said there was something on the placenta and they had to have the doctor look it over.  After the ultrasound I went down the road for the scheduled doctors appt and they wanted to send me for more and more tests.  At this point I had enough tests and appts so I gave them a hard time.  The doctor came back in the room and went off.  She said "I don't think your aware of how serious your situation is and it's very likely your going to have a stillborn".  Well, that's when I was like "What?"  No I don't know how serious my situation is.  Everything was ruled out in the beginning.  Or so I thought.  Apparently it wasn't and no one told me anything else so I assumed wrong.  Needless to say that same night my water broke and I went to the hospital. after 20+ hours in labor my daughter was born at 4lbs 12 ozs.  And she has a dimple above her bumb that I wasn't aware of until I got home from the hospital since she was in the nicu.  The pediatrician said it's a sign of Spina bifida but no further testing has been done at this point.  My daughter is now 2 1/2 and running around like any other 2 year old.|`|qStmw7qgaa	Well the pregnancy it's self was pretty normal though I was sick as a dog the first trimester (who said morning sickness was just in the morning?)  But I was told that I had Group B Strep (that bacteria that over 50% of pregnant Mommies have and have no idea how you get it).  I was induced because I was a week late.  I was in labor for 16 hours.  While walking to the bathroom at the hospital, my daughter decided to squeeze her umbilical cord and pass out.  I had an army of doctors rush in, put my on oxygen.  Then she let go of the cord and all was fine (just a little nerve racking).  Delivery went very smooth except my body rejected the medication that I was given so that my baby would not be exposed to the Group B Strep...so she was in the NICU for 4 days after I had her.  She also had Jaundice.  Now that was worse then the Group B exposure because she was turned out to be fine from that.  But because my husband's blood type was A+, and I'm O+, my daughter's blood type was A+.  Well...my body saw that I had a different blood type in me that wasn't O+, and so it was trying to change it...so when she was born, her body was breaking down too many red blood cells (because that is what my body was doing to her inside of me while it was trying to change her blood type to O+.) and it made her super jaundice.  So she was in the NICU for 4 days...and I was an emtional reck.  The delivery part though was smooth.    Everything is fine now, and I barely remember how it felt when everything happened.  You just have to keep in mind that you are going to have this wonderful bundle of love here in a while.  You are going to love that little person so much, that the scary and lonely parts of the pregnancy, especially the last few weeks, will simply go away.  You wont remember what they were like.  All the fear and anxiety are worth it in the end.  And remember, if you start to feel like this is all just too much, come back here and ask questions.  Becaue there is always someone out there who has been through the same thing...and they will be there to help!  :-D  Good Luck!!!!|`|qfuhHeDjaa	my first pregnancy i was sick all the time and exhausted but it was normal textbook as far as appointments go! with my second i started hemorraging at almost 7 weeks and bled for 4 weeks straight. once that stopped and she was still in there, heart beating away we thought we were in the clear.    until after my routine ultrasound at 20 weeks they called and said there were problems and they were sending me to a specialist. she had a spot on her heart and a 2 vessel which can be signs of downs syndrome or edward ssyndrome. we went to the specialists cautiosly optimistic only to be told she had short limbs, another sign of problems    at 33 weeks i went into labor and was hopitalized for a week during which 2 people came in (nicu guy and specialist) they both told me if she was born with downs they would treat her like any other baby born at this gestational age, if she was born with other problems theres nothing they could or would do    i was sent home and put on bed rest til 38 weeks and i had her just shy of 39 weeks after 2 hours of labor! ack!    eventful enough to last me a while!!!    o, she was born with the butt dimple as well, and a hole in her heart, she was scanned for spina bifada (ultrasound on her spine) and its closed up, and at her 3 mo apt with the pediatric cardiologist he said he thinks the hole is all closed up and to come back in 6 mo to make sure    so all that worry and shes fine! a little firecracker for sure tho!|`|qKnE08Rxaa	Congratulations! You made this far!     I gave still birth to my baby boy when I was 22 weeks pregnant. I actually had to go through a same labor process in order to let him come out of me. Horrible labor ever knowing that my baby was not alive anymore.     My next one, beautiful baby girl came out so healthy! But lots of effort to have her, shots to my belly every night, visiting tons of doctors almost every week of the pregnancy. I was so scared every second of day wondering if my baby's still alive in there or not. Whenever I go for an ultra sound, I always had to prepare myself hearing that my baby's dead but she made it!    Its a different situation but all mommies worries are the same. Don't stress your self out. It's not good for your baby. Be happy & think positive. You came this far. Your baby can come out right now & it'll be all good.     Take a good care of yourself ok?
LoP2CRE2aa	My puppy is named Avery (I'm thinking its pronounced the same) and I call her Avey (like A.V.) all the time. I love the name!     Your spelling could cause confusion though. Avery is the traditional spelling and may make her life a little easier.|`|qq804CE8aa	Ari or spelled it like Airee|`|hrEQXFdYaa	My little piece of advice is ease up the spelling... its a little confusing, i have a boy cousin avery and he doesnt have a nickname, cause its a tricky name, obviously Av for short...|`|7c47435ed764615f7c9efed94837c93faa	Ava  Rae  Vee    Hmmm|`|230NbPVUaa	My son's middle name is Avery, diffent spelling but I think is a nice name either way. But I don't think there is a  nickname for it..|`|fL3SiRDWaa	Avie?  Aivree is beautiful!|`|eBKJRmEgaa	No, I think it's awful, sorry. Avery is one thing, but Aivree looks immature and will be detrimental to your child.  How about Ada or Aveline?    ETA: Avery is a masculine name, that's why. You can't just respell a name in an illiterate way and call it 'the feminine spelling'. You asked for my opinion, and in my opinion that name, with that spelling, will be detrimental to your child's future.|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	ava maybe?|`|9Jnf5jRQaa	Is that the same pro. as Avery?  Very pretty|`|tWKZVDG2aa	Ava  Verie  Ave|`|nkM6wmv6aa	how do you pronounce it? and Claire is a lovely middle name.  could be ava? aivy? like to rhyme with wavy...i don't really know how to pronounce the name which makes it hard!|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	It's stupid, spell it right - Avery.|`|a0b83986209c3ad9a015c92f044e983eaa	How about Ree?|`|Vw9dvel1aa	Cute name!!! Great spelling! I would call her Ree. Thats what I would get. Think about it in a few years.|`|1BlTO6Kxaa	aivee probably... cute name btw and i like the spelling!|`|AA10154698	I love the name and would call her Aivree pronounce Avery,  Friends might call her Avi or Ree|`|NzFPFqaCaa	V or Ree could be nicknames.|`|Wnmg850Paa	Ace or V|`|2LTumLwNaa	Aivee or Ava :)
wKYdIaZVaa	I breastfed for almost a month before switching to formula. My period returned at 10 weeks after Chloe was born.     As far as your partner not wanting sex... I've heard that's quite common with men who decide to take a peak down there while the mother is delivering.Every man reacts differently. Hopefully, he'll get over it soon!    When you do start having sex again, make sure you're protected even if you haven't had your period. A friend of the family got pregnant right away because she thought she was safe. Little did she know that she was ovulating. Best of luck!|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	my son will be 7 weeks old tommorrow and ive had my first period after child birth starting yesterday.  i guess with each person its different.|`|qr8yxOBfaa	Did you ever think that you could be pregnant again?|`|AA10064551	Well I had a c-section so it took a while for me to stop bleeding after he was born so when it finally did, my actual period took a couple months to start. Don't stress it will probably start up any day now; Remember stress can actually keep you from starting.|`|JBRmTDgbaa	Oh God !  Don't jinx her !  Everyone is different.  My period never gives me a break so it came as soon as it was able too.  LITERALLY!  as soon as my post partum bleeding (Luchia- or something like that) stopped, my period started the day after and I'd say that was about 6-8 weeks post partum. If it doesn't start within the next 2 weeks, contact your doctor. Good Luck !|`|qStmw7qgaa	I'm going through this too...but my husband was chomping at the bit for sex...so I could in fact be pregnant again.  But I had my daughter on Nov. 20th.  Breastfed for a month, then switched (she was allergic to my milk...it sucked), then got my period on Jan. 4th.  But now I haven't started yet, and it has been a month already.  I have been told that it is normal for a woman to have very irregular periods for almost a year after having a baby...and there is a good chance you may not start for a few months still.  So good luck...and enjoy not having it for a while still.  :-)|`|ShJsLezOaa	I had my after birth period for 2 weeks right after birth and then it returned normally 2 weeks later. You can very easily get pregnant right away because of all the stuff going on. I'd take a test|`|Sn1cRueAaa	My baby is 3 weeks and 3 days old and i just now stopped bleeding...not from my period but after having her....|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I was 11.5 weeks pp, when my came.  Some people's body's just take longer, to get back on track, and even just breast feeding for a month will make a difference!|`|ggETPqedaa	I had the five week long period after birth, then a week after that had a regular period.|`|AA10186411	Mine started just a few weeks after she was born.  Have you had sex?  You may be pregnant again.|`|rjVALevtaa	I breastfed for the first month, then formula fed. I got my period about 2 months after giving birth.    It really varies from woman to woman. I mean some breastfeeding moms get their period back in 6 weeks, whereas some women like you don't breastfeed and have gone 2 1/2 months without a period.    It's all normal. I'm sure your period while come back soon. Until then just enjoy being PMS and cramp-free.
Fsr2Rofzaa	we wouldn't have an overpopulation problem.  Def. would not be a show called 17 and counting........|`|ERjGLJaEaa	They would be very very rich!!!|`|ioZeveazaa	That would be fantastic! Then they would know all the hardships of pregnancy and the good parts.|`|iwYu32N2aa	I don't think that men would be able to handle the pain of child birth. lol but it would be funny to see|`|XCueIYnYaa	Oh of they could get pregnant... If my boyfriend could trade places with me, i would show him how he sounds and acts when I ask him to do something for me. I'm 14 weeks pregnant and its not like I cant still do just about everything but sometimes I would like a little help and he sounds like a 5 year old when i ask. If only he knew what my body is going through.|`|v3LnJycKaa	Well for one the rate of teen pregnancy would be NONE, there would be 2/3 less people on earth, work days for those expecting would start at 11am, and end at 2pm, that is if they can work with the morning sickness, I know my hubby had the stomach flu for 24 hours a couple months ago and all I heard was groaning, "i think i am dying, I need to go to the hospital, uggghhh i cant stop throwing up"... the lines at the ladies room would be half as long as that of the mens...|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	PRAISE GOD!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU JESUS. I would so treat them like they treat us. I would laugh for 9 months straight. Actually on second thought I don't think so. Men are such babies. If I'm puking dieing sick then I'm "over exaggerating" but if my husband gets a paper cut it is the end of the world. I think that they would not be able to do it.|`|b3dKghjHaa	The big babies would probably never have unprotected sex again. lol|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	they would be in competition with other men to see who's belly gets bigger    haha men * pregnant - ha!|`|XpKY04Tnaa	Be careful what you ask for. Then we wouldn't need you.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	I saw a funny card that said if men had babies, their stretch marks would be called "hero stripes"  haha.|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	Then there would be no women...|`|W1p6LetFaa	You've probably heard this before, but if men were able to get pregnant, we'd have a LOT more only children out there because men are big babies and wouldn't go through labor more than once.  Only women are strong enough to have more than one. ;-)|`|9vgZNLP8aa	If men actually had to endure the whole pregnancy and labor/delivery of a baby then our babies would be grown in test tubes. lol    My husband told me flat out if he had to go through everything he has watched me go through to bring life into this world then we wouldn't have any more kids.|`|fXzed3fLaa	They would have beer, football and peanuts in the delivery room! lol|`|Cf4Ywe23aa	Hahaha!!    If only hey?    they'd get 2 years maternity (paternity!?!?)    sanitary products would be free    can you imagine how they'd cope with PMT?!!?!?    Aaaahhh men, they have no idea!!|`|xy0W50Lqaa	They would be comparing their bumps down the pub and having a laugh|`|t5KoPRVbaa	If they could go through what we do our Valentines Day presents would be alot better!|`|AA10154698	Then I would know for sure God is a woman and her sense of humor is wicked|`|3PBlpQFTaa	Thatd be awful!! Although I think the world would be a better place, nothing against women, its just that would help us develop a paternal instinct and wed be better parents like that.|`|lPgwZzoWaa	The world would end!  Men would never have more than one child!!|`|bglr4m0Naa	The guy that I like got kidney stones twice... and I heard that when a kidney stone passes... the pain that you feel is equal to a woman in labor... so I found a man who understands woman 100%
jnmeaUoBaa	honestly, it doesn't really matter. But, if you are really early (preg.) the hormone may not show up, that's why they say to take it first thing in the morning...GOOD LUCK!|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well it depends on how early before your period you are taking it.  If you haven't missed your period yet then it is best to take it first thing after you wake up in the morning because your urine is more concentrated but if you are past your period then it really doesn't matter but first morning is always more accurate.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	In the morning your urine is more concentrated and thats why they tell you to do it then. If you are taking a test a few days before you should have your period, you should do it in the morning because there might be higher hormone levels, but if you have already missed your period, your levels should be high enough to do a test anytime of day.|`|fXzed3fLaa	If you are not very far along, its best to do it is in the morn.  Your urine has been sitting in your bladder all night and can have more of the hormone in it.  Good luck!|`|bpnb91cAaa	YES...!!!|`|f4Nv0yBdaa	i honestly dont think it matters. ive had one baby and im pregnant again now and both times i took the test i did it closer to night time. first time i was 6 weeks when i found out and this time i was 2 weeks so i think if your pregnant your pregnant it will show up anytime|`|DI8o8r1Caa	I took one the night of my missed period and it came back positive.|`|vue9NOhYaa	First morning urine is best since the hormones are most concentrated in your urine at that time.    But modern pregnancy tests are so sensitive that, if your period is late, you should get an accurate result at any time. Still, if you test at night and it's negative, try again the next morning just to be sure.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	ive never had to do them in the morning it just depends how sensitive the test is and how much hcg u have at the time u test  good luck x|`|X2G8EHBlaa	if your only a few weeks along-if you are pregnant taking it in the morning would be best   but if you are farther along then that then it doesn't matter when you take it|`|XCueIYnYaa	Not necessarily. If you are only about 4-6 weeks, HCG levels aren't going to be high enough to detect anytime. The best time is right away in the morning, with the 1st urine the levels are higher. Taking it later, can give you a false reading.|`|yOyg3gnJaa	The reason for trying to take it in the morning vs. the evening is because earlier in your pregnancy, it is harder to detect your pregnancy hormone, and it is most prominent in the AM after having slept.  If you are a few weeks into your pregnancy and haven't realized it (like I did with my third), then a test at any point of the day will work.  Good Luck!|`|sDHxandWaa	It has something to do with chemicals in your urine which are strongest when you wake up because you haven't gone to the bathroom in several hours. When you go to bed, the chemicals are light because you've peed all day. So yea, you can take a test at any time of day, but the best results you can get will be in the morning during your morning whizz. =)
W1p6LetFaa	One of two things may have happened:  Your baby either finally flipped into the head down position, or may have even dropped!  Both scenarios would mean that he or she is kicking you in new places, perhaps NOT your ribs anymore.  Either way, this is good news!  It means that he or she is gearing up for the big debut!  Best wishes to you and your little one!|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	I would suggest getting some lessons in spelling before your child comes. But yes my son cracked my rib.|`|CJ3XHvIDaa	YOu dont make any sense...how old r u??  i think you are saying the baby is kicking you the ribs....uhh this is normal...|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	Learn how to spell then maybe we can understand what your asking & answer your question.
YFPMcHCbaa	None of the people on here will be able to tell you if you're pregnant. All the symptoms you get during pregnancy can also be associated with something else.    Take a test, or do some research. There are so many different places to get great information on the web.    babycenter.com  pregnancy.org  pregnancy.com  americanpregnancy.org  webmd.com/baby  pregnancy360.com  fitpregnancy.com  surebaby.com  pregnancytoday.com  pregnancy-calendars.org|`|xUewCMIlaa	You are Paranoid ...........ur not pregnant if your congested, and yuh probly wake up at night caus of da congestion, idk y ur eating more than usual, mayb because your afraid your parents will find out, or your afraid you are pregnant since it was your first time, alot pple eat alot wen their tense ! DO NOT WORYYY!!! lol have good day
EtCRnDJMaa	NO|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Youre the one thats giving birth, youre the one that tells the nurse, youre the one that fills out the paperwork, youre the one that signs that dotted line.    So why in the world, regardless of what they do for you, would you allow any person to name your child for you? If you allow them to do that, you might as well let them raise your child too. Put your foot down. And quite possibly, prepare to be kicked out. Although any good parent wouldnt kick you out because you wouldnt use the name they wanted. But if they did, you should raise your child elsewhere anyways. Who needs that around them?|`|aLwrpMPXaa	You are the only one giving them or not that right ! I personally named my children as I wanted but my parents, didn't even "suggest" a name. They know better !|`|1s3nddaYaa	no, name your child what you want. they may be helping you now vuz they wont be helping you forever and then you dont wanna live with the name they wanted for your child forever|`|WwXrTQgaaa	Hell no and if they used that logic they're nuts.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	no no unless there is something really wrong whicj i doubt  most parents help there sdult kids with money as you problably will|`|GTjkWZPlaa	Certainly not.|`|G5vGTTqhaa	Maybe|`|nzOWdzQRaa	Not at all.. You're the one carrying the baby not them...|`|fdnbXfvfaa	No way!  How rude.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	No that is ridiculous.|`|AA10730513	Nope. ... I think it would be nice of you to take their suggestion into consideration. Even let them tell you what they like about the name they chose and dislike about what you chose. But when it comes down to it - YOU name your baby.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	No I don't think they do.|`|rAkWoweOaa	No way!!!!!!!!!|`|T9sC92Braa	Its not their place to do so.|`|NoUvFOPoaa	No.  You are the one who will be taking care of the child the rest of their lives no mater what their age is.  When I was thinking of a name for my son I was originally going to use my dads first name for his middle name but he made a suggestion to use his last name he doesn't go by anymore and it sounded and rolled together alot better.  So i used that.  If they want to pick the whole name I would draw the line right there.
l9jtfrU4aa	They dont cost that muchwell I take that back, some can cost upwards of $20, but then some are just $8 so it really depends on which one you get. I would go with First Response, simply because like the name says, it will tell you first. But from I understand they all work the same, so just go with a name you recognize or ask the pharmacist which brand they think is a better.    Hope this helps,  -Pandora-|`|iwYu32N2aa	you can go to the dollar store and buy the ones that they sell there. Those are probably the cheapest ones that you can get. I used EPT and I don't remember how much it cost;s|`|xnhwmontaa	$1 are dollar general and $1 at dollar tree... First response 2 pack $8 at walmart|`|8WRnqs08aa	HPTs range from $1.00 to $15.00    Do you have a Dollar Tree Store? Ours sales HPTs for $1.00 and they work great! You don't need to spend a fortune to get the same result! Good Luck!|`|0uhRgfcsaa	get one at the dollar store.|`|IA5zVfk0aa	dollar tree its a dollar
XE45S6OTaa	My answer is this.  While you could be having twins, I think its more likely that you are an early ovulator.  I am a late one.  Most women don`t actually ovulate on day 14 of their cycle.  By my last period, I would be 10 weeks pregnant.  In real life I am almost 8.      With my first pregnancy I got pregnant while I was skipping my period with the birth control pill.      I would say take it really easy, and wait for the results.      Regardless of how many babies are in there, it still takes the same amount of time to implant.  Good luck and congrats|`|EzbJsE5eaa	I just found out about a month ago that I was pregnant. Before I found out, I had a really strange dream that I had a child. While it seemed extremely real, I didn't think it was a reality. Ever since I came off the depo shot (please no one ever take that thing..), I had experienced odd pregnancy symptoms that were consistently false, so when I had breast soreness and swelling, along with a missed period, and some bloating, I thought I was just getting ready to have another period. But, I took a test, and it came out flaming positive! I swear, this thing had an aura around it. :) So, I feel in way my dream predicted my conception. I did go to the doctor the same day for a blood test, which also came out positive. As I only dreamt about one, that's all I'm carrying. But, I wouldn't doubt a dream of two. Many pregnant women claimed to have experienced future-telling dreams of children, while some scientists claim that it's merely just hormones. But, there's a link that I found somewhat helpful, but it's kinda scientifically bias. Nonetheless, good luck in your ventures!|`|ygbDZPJHaa	hi girl well my friend did and She was..so I advice you to be careful cause you could be but as a friend i am wishing you the best of luck                                                                                           ***princess***
1SGl03Zlaa	I never intended to co sleep, but from day one she guilted me into it.  Our first night at the hospital she would wake up when I put her down and I felt bad since she had spent 9 months sleeping in me so I ended up letting her sleep with me.  At 2 months I tried to get her to start sleeping by herself but she had gotten used to being in bed with me and wouldn't.  I ended up having to sleep with her for the first 14 months and every night was battle to get her to sleep.  With my next one I am going to try really hard to have the baby sleep on its own from the beginning so I don't have to break the habit later.    My sister ended up having her daughter sleep with her until she was 5 and it was really hard for her to break the habit (it took her 3 years to finally get her sleeping in her own bed all night).    It can be nice and convenient to co sleep, but breaking the habit is so hard.  If your daughter is willing to sleep by herself I wouldn't try to change that, you'll still have plenty of time to cuddle during the day and in the long run it will more beneficial to have a child that doesn't rely on you to be able to fall asleep.|`|AC1v9v4Saa	I think it is great that your baby can fall asleep by herself, I would be happy about that.  My 4 month old usually ends up in bed with us sometime through the night, it's not his fault  it's mine.  I'm usually too tired to sit up and feed him, so we lay next to each other and i feed him laying down, and we both fall asleep, he usually burps on his own or will wake up if he has any gas pains.  I know this is not recommended because of the risk of SIDS but he rolls on his back and I scoot down lower than him so the blankets won't go over his head.  I would be so happy if he slept through the night, because i do get better sleep when he is in his crib in his room.  If you are nervous that you may not be able to hear her through the night just put a monitor in her room and bring the receiver in your room. Enjoy|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I co-sleep because I honestly believe it is the best for my baby developmentally, all of us get the best possible night's sleep, I couldn't stand the thought of him being in his own room and even in our room in his own bed, we'd miss out on a lot. It's also the only way he sleeps, so it's just the best choice for us. I have co-slept from day one.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	Well I never said hey I wanna cosleep...It just kinda happened...I was so afraid of something happening to my son while we were sleeping and I never got to sleep anyway cause I was always up he slept lots better in our bed and my husband and I did as well! He is know almost 3 and my husband will still go get him out of his room which he sleeps in fairly well now to sleep with us cause he says he misses him now my niece doesn't like to be cuddled or touched when she goes to sleep and has always been that way she has always slept in her own room with no problems...I am sure that it is just her personality just a little miss independent... :)|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I wasn't intending to co-sleep. She has a moses basket but she never liked it, and woke frequently. Since sleeping with me, she sleeps for longer and doesn't get as upset.|`|x7vTKP24aa	i never intended too, my daughter would not sleep unless she fell asleep nursing. i would unlatch her and she would flip out. our lactation consultant actually recommended co sleepiing, cuz we all could benefit from it. we tried --it worked --all better. she is almost sleeping through the night now at 4 mo. without nursing so we are starting to get her used to her own bed|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	We always intended to cosleep with all our kids. My daughter wanted nothing to do with it though. It was difficult at first but once we figured it out she slept so well. She also never fell asleep nursing.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	I didn't intend to co-sleep.  I was breastfeeding exclusively and I   would just sit up in bed to feed him.  I was so tired that I would just fall asleep holding him.  I'd wake up and lay him in bed next to me rather than taking him all the way back to his crib.  Thus began co-sleeping in our household.  We'd put him to bed in his crib at the beginning of the night then he'd sleep in our bed after he woke up for his feeding.  When we realized he slept better in our bed, we'd bring him there if he was having a rough night or if he was sick.  Now at 10 months he sleeps in his own crib through the night.  Worked for us.|`|3lRX0tHkaa	Go to the doctor.|`|8026ec062aaa229b35c5aceb76a16035aa	We never intended to co-sleep, however our little man just ended up there somehow, mostly because I was tired and during breastfeeding I would often fall asleep with him. However, its not all its cracked up to be. It is sweet at first, but then it becomes a major issue when he is still co-sleeping at 5 - and showing no signs of giving it up. He does start out in his bed, but usually within 2-3 hours he is back in my bed. Be thankful if she sleeps better in her bed now, it will make things much easier on you and your marriage later on.|`|8t8NjjnVaa	I didn't intend to cosleep.  I intended for my child to sleep in her cradle for the first few years and then switch to her crib.      But my daughter had reflux and needed to nurse pretty much around the clock.  It was just too draining for me to sit up to nurse for 20 minutes, then spend the time trying to get her back down in the cradle, and then repeat the process an hour later.      One night I just laid her down next to me to nurse, and the next thing I knew, it was morning.  We both slept a whole lot better.  So I still put her down in her cradle, but when I went to bed, she'd spend the rest of the night in bed with me.    With my second, we didn't even bother setting the crib up!      Don't listen to the people who say you'll never get the child out of your bed once you let them in.  I decided to get them to sleep on their own when they were two years old and were able to understand what I was telling them.   Within a few days, both slept in their own beds in their own rooms all night with no stress and no tears.|`|VzOokYEqaa	your lucky! my daughter slept in her crib near our bed but when she got older it was so much easier to nurse her when we were laying down and now that's how i put her to sleep.     plus it was really cold and i wanted to keep her warm. now she needs be wedge into my side or touching daddy and me while she sleeps.     if your baby is comfortable then don't worry about it.|`|Sn1cRueAaa	I wasnt intending to co-sleep...but when i came home from the hosp i wanted to have her in my view..bec i was so use to looking at her in the hosp...but the way her crib was positioned there was no way for me to see her..so i put her in the bed with me for about a week...and  after that i tried to put her in her crib when she falls asleep...but she'd wake right back up...she'd never stay..so now she still sleeps with me and my fiance..shes 3weeks and 3 days   :( i think i made a boo boo|`|AA11476782	I was actually against the idea of cosleeping--mostly because of my fear of SIDS/suffocation.  Her dad thought (when I was pregnant) that we'd want to do it and I said no way.  For the first couple months she slept great in her crib.  Then, she started waking up and crying within minutes of being put down (no matter how long we let her sleep in our arms before putting her down).  Plus, I had come back to work, plus I was breastfeeding.  With these factors combined, and the fact that she was a very strong baby (could lift her head well, turn it to each side, roll over, etc.), we finally just decided cosleeping was the best option.  She can nurse when she partially wakes in the night, and we have added cuddle time.|`|OHq5gSjJaa	I was dead set against co--sleeping.  But one night out of pure exhaustion we pulled her in the bed with us, and realized how much better she slept with us!  Instead of waking every 1-2 hours, and then taking up to 2 hours to go back to sleep, she slept 3-4 hours at a time.  It was marvelous.  Now at 7 months she starts in her crib for the first couple hours, and then I pull her into bed when she wakes up.  I actually sleep better when she is next to me because when she is in her crib I have one ear listening to the monitor the whole time...  lol.  I love co-sleeping :)      But if your daughter is sleeping fine in her own room I would just let her be!
IIjixM4Raa	Dont worry 11 yr old DO STILL wet the bed - Im 13 and still do sometimes|`|dcovK6oqaa	take her to a therapist if in the end there is no choice. 11 years old is to old to wet the bed.  maybe she also has an urine infection?  don't put her anymore night time pants so she will get use to it. and will go to the bathroom at night. It would have been best to have trained her at night when she had been still in preschool.  well is not to late . get her use to getting up at night to go to the bathroom. she shouldn't drink a lot of water  before bedtime. because that causes to pee a lot.|`|JiRa3lgkaa	try 1 month or so|`|AA12017096	Er... 11 year olds don't wear dry nights|`|gZ1XZBBKaa	only after he feels comfortable about it. if u think it might happen again, then keep wearing them.|`|YseGAHIfaa	by 11 he shouldnt wet the bed|`|ABvw9Ocoaa	depends if he has a weak bladder. i knew someone who had the problem at age 17|`|FwpIVRxTaa	my little sister has the same problem. except she is a verrrrrrrrrrry heavy sleeper. you could pick her up by her feet then put her back down then when she wakes up nobody noticed! maybe he has the same problem!
PPk0ahMFaa	Aww, its nice to hear that mummy moo! You know I have followed alot of your posts for quite a while now! haha    And yep - I have to agree - I got the 'she'll be clingy, your too soft' etc when my daughter was a baby because I wouldn't let her cry even when that mean't carrying her around and nursing on demand. And at 2 1/2 we're still happily co-sleeping (and nursing). But she is very social - she loves saying hello to people we pass in the street and likes showing off and being funny. I used to wonder how I would be able to put her in pre-school at aged 3 but I can see now how much she will love and enjoy it and can't wait! I take her to playgroups and she happily plays with the toys, other children, does arts and crafts. She even drew a picture of one of the ladies who runs it!   AND - this was funny -  when I was talking to another mum who was cuddling her younger child I looked over at mine and asked if she wanted a cuddle too but she said no. Then a few mins later I looked up and she had crawled onto a stranger-womans lap and was cuddling HER! I was gobsmacked! LOL  She's stayed at my sisters house over night once and been to a kids party with a friend of mine who has a 3 1/2 yr old so she doesn't mind being away from me. She also wants to do EVERYTHING herself - from feeding the cat to getting dressed! She's trying to make daddy a cup of tea right now (climbing on a chair to get the milk out the fridge). And yet at the same time she is loving and loves cuddles and says 'do you love me? Do you love your little bean? (what we call her)' etc.     I know its slightly unrelated - and not saying that a non-nursing, non-co-sleeping child wouldn't be the same - but I feel that our nursing is important because it allows her to link to still being a baby whilst she grows up fast in everything else.     We're just starting something new now too - where night-weaning hasn't worked I am trying the opposite. I have told her she can have it when 'its dark' so thats from about 4-5pm onwards and she has accepted that and is having none all day. Firstly thats because day is easier to distract from but also night is the hardest time to cut out because she is too sleepy to remember what we have talked about (ie No milkies until morning) She agree's when awake! But once asleep that need for comfort takes over.  Anyhoo....just thought you might fiind that interesting for further down the line!|`|Jz15JG6baa	Well I didn't breastfeed, my daughter slept in her own cot from day one and although I never used CIO, she was left to cry sometimes if I had to e.g unload groceries or do the laundry.  She is 16 months now and is also very independent!  She loves kisses and cuddles but she is happy to play alone.  She is also very interested in other children and loves to watch them play for a while before going to say hello.  Maybe your child simply has an outgoing personality?  It might have nothing to do with how long you breastfed for!  I know that's an unfashionable view but I also think it's a balanced one.|`|6XSOVAh0aa	Mine was that way at first.  Now she's going to be 4 soon and is getting more aware of people and she picks and chooses who she will cozy up to, stranger or not.  She doesn't play too much by herself these days, which worries me a little.|`|dRd5d6Bgaa	My daughter is a lil over 15 months old. From the time she started rolling around and crawling, she's been very independent. Of course she's walking now, but she's still very independent. With being independent though, there's also the side of my daughter that she likes to be cuddled and tickled and just held. She goes through that every evening, where she just wants to be around my husband and I.|`|NTK4XLuDaa	My mother in law kept giving out 'advice' on how to raise my children. She is now eating her words as my eldest son has just started nursery and is social and independent. I think it really gets up her nose as she has been telling me and my husband to send them to a day nursery since they were six months old in order for them to become socially active.|`|hGNvbC6oaa	SAME here!  I co-sleep, babywore, extending breastfeeding etc etc and everyone tells me I'm babying my son and he's gonna be a sissy.  Well, total opposite.  He loves to play alone, he loves when we goes new places.  He's a tiny bit shy (personality-wise only) but as soon as he's warmed up, he explores everything, says hi to everyone and runs around happily.  As long as he knows I'm in close proximity, he's happy and independant.  He's 19 months old.  I've been told several times by the daycare he is one of the most independant children in his class.  Happy to play alone and is very lovey towards the other children and teachers if someone gets hurt or is sad.  All this being sad, he still IS a mommy's boy.  Usually wanting to be very close to me when I am with him and doesn't like me to normally leave the room without him.  Which, I really don't mind at all!  He loves his mommy!|`|iQjS2lJ4aa	Im the same as you, my little boy is 12 months, we co slept ( until he preferred his own bed) Im still breastfeeding and have never let him cry.    He too is so independent, sometimes I feel left out when I see the other babies his age clinging to their mummies (just for a second) but I know hes a very well adjusted little boy.    As soon as I take him to a playgroup hes off like a shot to whatever games he wants first, he does check where I am occasionally, (but I noticed even if he doesn't see me sometimes hes not bothered!!)  He is also affectionate and loves his cuddles when hes tired.|`|KmC0K59taa	Mine is 21 months and pretty independent.  She's always climbing upstairs to find something to get into or going into another room.  She never wants to be held anymore.  She only sits down beside me at night when she is getting tired.  Sometimes I miss her being little.  Now she is too busy for hugs and kisses and I have to force her!    She is our only child, but she does attend a daycare fulltime.  I think that has helped her a lot.  She is used to the fact that mommy leaves her there every morning and daddy will pick her up later.  She is not clingy at all.|`|uxItOSkmaa	24 months old and the same as your daughter.  Very independent but still really affectionate despite every attempt I made to 'spoil' him during infancy (cosleeping, giving him attention at every whimper etc.) LOL|`|0psCy0XXaa	my two and a half year old is very independant just like yours but all kids are different sounds to me like you are doing a good job, but make sure she understands the dangers of independance as she grows up.|`|mAsQbiIgaa	Your daughter sounds lovely.  My baby is 9 months and I am in the midst of being criticised for continuing breast feeding, co-sleeping and not leaving her to cry!!  She is already though such a content baby and can happily occupy herself for extended periods of time!      I tell everyone who criticises me I am helping her become a happy, trusting baby who knows her mummy is there for her regardless and that gives her the confidence to try things herself.      Sounds like exactly what you have done!   Convinces me I am doing the right thing!!     I don't think she sounds too independent at all-the very fact she checks where you are is proof of that.  People just love to have an opinion!!|`|7Htl4FCGaa	I was a pretty attached parent as well.  I guess I'm not sure how to answer this because she was quite clingy the first year or so of her life.  Now she is very well-adjusted, social and independent.  When the babysitter comes, she literally pushes me out the door saying "Go Mama!"  She waves to everyone in the mall, and leaves me to go to nursery with no problem whatsoever.  But she still has a difficult time playing by herself-- she always wants me involved.  Maybe that's just the age.  Congrats for raising an independent little girl.  Isn't that the goal anyway?
62hGVNhoaa	I don't think you are being mean, I understand why schools do these sort of things but don't understand why some classes are allowed snack breaks and others not. If they are going to ban 1 class, they need to ban the whole school or else resentment builds up.  I wonder how many of these children are truly "allergic" to things. It seems to be quite fashionable at the moment to say your child has an allergy although many times if you probe further no tests have ever been carried out.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	My son is allergic to milk.  Yes, he has been tested.  Yes, he has had an anaphylactic reaction in which he would have stopped breathing had I not gotten him to the emergency room in time.     That said, there are no rules restricting snacks in his classroom.  Over the years, we have let the other parents know about his allergy, asking them to contact us before sending in treats, if they would like for him to be able to join in.  Some do, some don't.  My son deals with it - it is his problem, no one else's.  We've got some extra treats there in the teacher's desk for the times when she wants to give him something.  No big deal.     But, that's just how our school district & our family decided to approach the problem.  My son is safe within those guidelines and we are OK with the way things are.  As each year passes, more and more of his friends & classmates are making an effort to accomodate for his allergies, to include him in the celebrations.  I actually think that the lesson in empathy that the kids are learning because of my son's allergy is a great thing for all of the kids in the classroom.       The thing is, though, that your child's teacher -or- the school district that your child attends, feels that 'no snacks in the classroom' is the best way to deal with the potential risks that allergies can bring to the school.  It may also just be a way to keep things fair & on track in the classroom, concentrating on school instead of parties & treats.      Personally, if my children's teachers have rules in place in their classroom, for whatever reason, I respect the teacher's right to maintain his/her classroom as they see fit and I teach my kids to do the same.  Is it really such a tragedy if your child learns a little compassion and doesn't get a cupcake every once in a while?  Are there not more important things to worry about in life?  Are you not creative enough to figure out other non-food ways to treat your children and the children in the classroom?|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Look at it from another angle, this also can promote healthy eating by not doing this.  Instead of using snacks as a reward, something else could be used.  Look at all the adults who have issues with food, maybe this will prevent it.  Then think about low US test scores.  School should be school, save the parties for outside of school.|`|8DnIXwnyaa	I agree to a point.  I think the parents of the allergic children should work with the teacher to develop a list of safe snacks.  Then parents can rotate sending safe snacks for the class (off of the approved list) and all the kids can participate in the celebration.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	i absolutely agree with you.  I feel sorry for the kids with allergy but sometimes it is getting a bit too far ... at the beginning of the school year, we recieved a note from one of the parent whose kid is allergic to basically "everything", and we other parents are required to abide to her "rule", for example, if we are going to bring in cupcakes, we should make something which is suitable for his son to eats too, her son is allergic to egg so she even attached receipe for making cake without eggs ... i was like, why we are responsible for it?? can she brings in something for him to eat instead of we all other parents has to make something special just because he can't eat?  i might sounds mean but it is getting into my nerve a little, not to mention we are not allow PJ sandwich anymore.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I think it is ridiculous. I'm glad my daughter's school hasnt done any of that yet. She is in first grade and we are allowed to bake things at home to send in. When I worked at a preschool, I understood that it's hard to deal when one of the children has an allergy but we let the parents know that some has a peanut allergy and everything was peanut free. Or the parent of the child with an allergy would bring in a special snack for them. Listen, it's life. That child will have his allergy forever. They will be fine as long as they have something special too. I think it is awful to take away snack time too. Maybe you can suggest everyone pooling together say $2 per week and one parent buying a "class" snack that is suitable for everyone? Oh and my daughter, who is 7, has lunch at 11 am. If she went 4 1/2 hours until she got home without eating, she would be starving! Her class gets snack in the afternoon and she still comes home looking for food. School is definitly tougher now than it was when I was a kid. Good luck!|`|cOZOnQOUaa	I know it sucks! My daughter brought cupcakes, and instead of giving them back the teacher threw them away and made the kids lie saying they ate them. I don't know why. I mean the kids practically play all day, run. So they aren't overweight. Those kids are the ones with parents who let them have cell phones at 9. I mean WHO'S ALLERGIC TO CUPCAKES!|`|S3WeYrVgaa	I think it is ridiculous to not allow snacks at school parties.  My son is in second grade and they get to eat snack at recess which is fine with me at least they give them the option to have a snack.  If other kids have food allergies then their parents should take something for their child to eat and not be required to pitch in with the stuff the rest of the kids will be eating.  Snacks are not a reward when kids are in school (since somebody mentioned they should not be used as a reward).  Kids burn through so much energy it's not even funny and therefore snacks help refuel them so they can stay focused in order to get higher test scores.  Can't have a kid so hungry that all they are thinking about is how tired and hungry they are.  School should be school but school should allow time for them to be kids as well and be able to enjoy little parties here and there with all the eats to go along with them (and it's not like they do them first thing in the morning they wait until the afternoon).
AA12145826	When my daughter was about 2, she was running across the room (something she now knows not to do) and about 3 feet away from where I was sitting on the floor, tripped on a ball. Her momentum carried her far enough that she landed with most of her body on my head. Her elbow hit me in the eye causing my glasses to scrap against my eyelid. I ended up with a black eye, a large series of scratches across my eyelid on forehead and a concussion. She really did feel bad, she was crying and kept saying "I sowwy Mommy. I kiss better?" My husband wasn't quite sure who he should attend to. Going into work the next day was great too, I kept telling everyone "You should see the other one..."    Other than that, the only other child induced accident I had was actually more my husband's fault. We were throwing out old bedding and my husband thought it would be fun to have a pillow fight. My daughter was 3 at the time and was having fun joining in. Somehow I ended up (once again) on the ground and my husband tripped over our daughter and his knee landed on my left hip. We seriously thought me might have cracked my pelvis (he's a big guy) so he called 911. The funny part of the story is the fact that my husband is a volunteer with our town's fire department, so when the call went out over the scanner for an ambulance to come to our house, 75% of the fire department showed up to "help." Here I am lying on the ground in obvious pain with about 30 guys asking "what did he do to ya?" My husband's friend is one of the cops in town and HE showed up seeing if he could help. He asked me, jokingly, as they put me in the ambulance "do you want me to write up a domestic report?" I was kind of annoyed at that point (I knew it was an accident, but I pain was clouding my thinking) and said sarcastically through gritting teeth and Lamaze breathing techniques (turns out those classes were good for something after all), "not right now, but you might want to show up after I get out of the hospital, he might want to report me." Thankfully it turned out to only be a bad case of sciatica and a severely bruised hip joint. To this day, whenever my husband starts horse around with me, I playfully remind him "remember what happened last time?"|`|7e700825133cf6328b412b5715dc6692aa	<<<<When i was changing this little mans diaper/nappy he brought his legs down on my chest and winded me i passed out for a while, he is 10 and very strong, although he didn't understand what he had done i am sure he didn't mean it|`|cAtWxJG1aa	my son broke my tooth with a maraca when he was waving one around as an infant.  admittedly the tooth had been broken before, so it didn't take a lot of force to do it the second time.  but, still, it was fairly embarrassing to explain to the dentist.|`|AA11210211	The worst injury's my children have ever given me is my c-section scar but that wasn't their fault!! lol my son gave me a fat lip once,we were playing and he jumped and head butted me in my mouth it was fat for about 3 days.The worst my daughter has even given me is a scratch but she is only 1 yr.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	other than birth lol i blood nose  her little tiny sweet head on my lrg nose lol is she is  20 months|`|AA11327039	I worked in a pre-school before I had children and one of the 3 year old children actually broke the nose of one of the teachers.

Pf9fyEyQaa	I felt pretty good.  I didn't get morning sickness and I wasn't very tired or anything.  I had an ultrasound done at exactly 13 weeks and everything was great, I was looking forward to an appointment with my doctor at 14 weeks to hear the heartbeat!      I am now 35 weeks and getting pretty close to meeting my son!  Good luck with the pregnancy!|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	I didnt feel like anything either, it really didn't feel like I was pregnant.

ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	All the new cribs available have been tested for everything that can possibly go wrong.  Always get a new one not a handme down unless it is under 5 years old and never had any damage done by heavy children jumping in it.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	First of all, 99% of the cribs for sale, NEW, meet high standards for safety.  The slots should be narrow enough that a baby's head can't fit through.  The top of the rails at the head and foot should be as high as the baby's head.  The back and front of the crib (especially the side you get the baby in and out of) should have a rubber rail on it, designed for teething, but also helps against a head butt.  A baby's crib should be used for sleeping, and not to play in, and a baby should be gotten out of the crib so they don't get the opportunity to bang their head.      It is very important to get a new crib mattress.  This helps prevent SIDS.  By not smoking in the house, not using any medications, or alcohol during pregnancy goes a lot further towards preventing SIDS.      Make sure the crib mattress is the proper size for the baby's crib, and that at first you have bumper pads, which should be removed when the baby starts to stand up, so they don't go over the side.      Just because a crib isn't expensive doesn't mean it's not safe.  I saw a really cute one in Walmart the other day for less than 200.  Quite frankly, it looked just like the one I used to sell for $649 at a baby boutique.      It's best to not use the pack-n-play for a regular crib, because they don't have the proper back support for a growing baby to sleep all night in.  They are fine for naps.|`|D5dS539yaa	Davinci Baby is one of the top crib manufacturers out there.  http://www.homelement.com/products/Baby-...    Good luck!
Pf9fyEyQaa	I have had a fairly normal pregnancy.  There was some concern at the 18 week ultrasound but that was all cleared up at the 21 week ultrasound appointment.  I developed anemia which is very tiring and have to take an extra supplement and get plenty of rest (my levels were less than half of the lower end of normal).    A couple of my friends however haven't been so lucky so I will share their stories.      One has a kidney problem and had to be on the medication prednizone to control it.  Prednizone is very addictive so the baby was addicted to it.  She had to go in for an ultrasound every month and she was very swollen due to the kidney problem.  A couple days ago she gave birth to a 6lbs 1oz baby girl.  Her cord was compressed causing her to lose oxygen and she started going through withdrawel during labour.  Now she is trying to scratch at her face and it's very sad to watch her in such distress.  She has severe jaundice and is in the NICU undergoing phototherapy...but she is very beautiful and her outcome looks good...here's a picture to prove it: http://i303.photobucket.com/albums/nn130...  Her and her mom are still in the hospital overcoming obsticles...they hope to have them both out by the weekend.    A cousin of mine had gestational diabetes, extreme swelling, high blood pressure, and other problems in the pregnancy.  She gave birth to a healthy baby girl who got to go home right away.  She is however having problems with breastfeeding and such; but overall healthy.    Another friend of mine had a very normal pregnancy until 35 weeks when she went into labour.  She dialated 1.5 cm before they could stop the labour.  Then at about 38 weeks she had her beautiful 7lb 5oz baby girl (I know, a lot of girls).  A day later something went wrong and her daughter was put in the NICU.  I don't know the prognosis or anything about that one; but I know things weren't looking good for a while.      I can't even imagine going through these problems in my pregnancy or knowing that something was wrong with my baby.  I would go through anything though to make sure my little one was as healthy as possible!  I hope things look up soon for you...not too much longer before you have your little one in your hands!!  Good luck!|`|MtC3CWZraa	I guess you could call this rough, but I dont choose to dwell on the bad stuff. I tend to accept that situations are what they are. I do what I can to make the best of it and dont stress myself out over anything outside of my control.     That said, Im having my 6th ultrasound next Monday   39 weeks. My first was due to early bleeding. The second because of the results of my quad scan. The third was to check her growth because I was measuring small.    At that third u/s, they found a large (5 cm  i.e. half the size of the birth canal) growth in her abdomen so I had a 4th u/s with a specialist who confirmed my docs suspicion that its a benign ovarian cyst.  U/s 5 & 6 are to keep monitoring it.     Ive had weekly non-stress tests since 34 weeks as a precaution since she has this unusual issue.    Its not like Im overjoyed at any of this stuff, but I dont sit around freaking out that something is terribly wrong with my baby. Ive made the best choices I can and weve discusses the ramifications of her issue.  Were doing all we can, and since theres nothing I can do to change all of this, I dont waste my energy fretting about it.|`|0722e5ddd4c6c3cb4e310338f3c85935aa	My older sister had two really hard pregnancies she was on bed rest both times and had every problem imagined.

The doctor is going to induce me on 2-19-09 if she doesn't come before then. He says the baby looks fine. I have another ultrasound on Tuesday (this will be my 5th ultrasound).

ZS7MM6Xvaa	It's most likely the muscles around your uterus.  I've had that problem and sometimes it hurts so bad I have to just sit still for a few minutes.  It most frequently occurs when you have sudden movements such as standing up quickly or twisting sideways, at least for me anyway.  If you start having other symptoms or if it lasts for longer than five or ten minutes, I'd say give your doctor a call just to be sure.  That's what they're there for!|`|UaL28atDaa	This is normal but be thankful this is supposed to be a more comfortable stage than the first few months. Take a look at this video it explains how your baby is developing and what you should be experiencing.     http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/...    Good luck|`|YhjFiVGyaa	ur uterus is stretching thats all. i was around that time frame when i first started feeling them also and i called my ob/gyn all scared something was wrong. she said, 'u have a baby growing inside of you, you are GOING to feel ur uterus stretching at some point or another.' ligament pain can be kind of annoying.  try sitting in a tub of hot water or a heating pad. also exercising and massaging ur abdomen helps too. try not to take anything.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Round ligament pains from your uterus growing and stretching and walking up and down stairs puts more strain on those muscles.  Every woman shows at different rates.|`|Kj84qLozaa	its probably just growing pains, but if it causes you really bad discomfort its not normal and best to be checked out.    if your small and thin you will show earlier! congrats x|`|5805bf3a9bb2e4808ef2d73593aaab11aa	I had cramps similar to menstral cramps at that stage whenever I would lay down. Aches are normal in that matter, however if you're describing them as 'really bad' I would call your doctor right away, and fill them in. It could be totally normal for you and if that's the case, you'll have peace of mind. They might have you come in and do a quick ultrasound to make sure everything is as it should be. Then you'll have peace of mind, and get a sneak peak at your jelly bean! :) Good Luck!

7bTOY5vHaa	Don't get your membranes stripped. If your body is not ready for labor is can have bad side affects. My doctor did it to me 3 years ago with my first pregnancy and it caused me to go into prolonged labor for 3 days! And since I was in labor for so long I hemorrhaged  after giving birth and almost had to have a hysterectomy. Well when I got pregnant with my second I told the doctor I didn't want them to do that again and she said that they don't do it anymore because of all the risks.|`|MtC3CWZraa	Im not a doctor, but since stripping the membranes involves separating the amniotic sac from the cervix, there has to be access to that area. If youre not dilated, Im pretty sure theres no access.
2HETgiwgaa	Here are the instructions (a link to a page where you can download the full manual is below - you may want to start at maxi-cosi.com and select your own country just in case there are any differences - the link is for the UK version.)  Sorry, if you already have the instruction manual, this probably doesn't help.      The company also have some videos on YouTube eg http://www.google.co.nz/url?sa=t&source=... it may help to watch it to see if you can pick up some clues about where the straps should go through (I checked, and it didn't show fitting the cover, sorry :-))    6.2 Removing the cover  ? First remove the belt pads.  ? Open the rim at the sun canopy as far as possible (21 & 22).  ? Remove the cover from the hooks (8x) (27).  ? Remove the cover then from under the hooks and quick adjuster button (28).  ? Pull the buckle tongue sections and adjustment strap through the openings.  6.3 Refitting the cover  ? To refit the cover, carry out the above instructions in reverse order.  ? Make sure that the lower section of the cover flaps over the uppersection.  ? When closing the rim, make sure the sun canopy is stored properly in the rim.  ? Fasten the adjustment strap under the shell again.
WPI0Z47saa	I had a c-section and lost the weight the first year. I also breast fed which helps. I can bearly see my scar. It is at my bikini line and is skin colored and just looks like a fine scratch. Do you think you will need a c-section? It isn't an option unless there is a medical reason. Insurances won't pay for an unnecessary one and it is major surgery so most doctors won't even entertain this idea.|`|xHKRGEg4aa	The weight depends on you.

My tummy went down almost immediately    Due to bladder surgery in 2003, I must have c-sections to prevent tearing my TVT. My last pregnancy in June 2008 was delivered via c-section. I had a tummy for a few months, but I lost wieght fairly quickly. The scar is very fine & minimal. It actually just looks like a 5 inch crease line. My doctor did a very nice job!|`|l5OMFTMUaa	I heard you loose more weight if you breast feed an i would think natural birth because after a c- you will be out of commission (not moving very well) for a few weeks... also weight gain around scare tissiue is not too pretty...|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	You tend to loose weight quicker after a natural birth because there are no restrictions on movement.  I had a c-section the first time and I was sore for quite awhile and couldn't do any abdominal exercises until healed and felt okay.  The scar is only 4 inches long and barely noticeable and is a bikini cut so it is also really low.|`|4v90WyUhaa	I don't know about natural but I've had 2 c-sections. I lost weight differently with both. I lost weight fast after my first but haven't lost much of my stomach from second pregnancy.

r39EDGhPaa	False negatives are somewhat common.  Get another test or two if you are so worried.    I highly, HIGHLY doubt you are pregnant.  You wouldn't get a full on period when you're pregnant, you could get spotting, but not heavy bleeding like when you're on your period.  I would say "no you're not pregnant" but I don't want to end up being wrong, lol.  But chances are really slim.    For future reference, Plan B is only 85% effective and messes with your hormones very badly.  It is about the equivalent of taking 17 birth control pills. So try to avoid taking it from now on.    Do you put quotations around it to make yourself feel better?  He penetrated you, you had SEX.  No quotations.  It was sex.  Not good sex.. actually, very lame sex.. but it was sex.|`|hrEQXFdYaa	you dont need to regret what you did, just learn... And i was just reading reports that most precum does NOT have sperm in it, unless he doesnt pee etc. THerefore because you took plan B i think it is HIGHLY UNLIKEY you are pregnant.

The egg is only viable for 24 hours, that is the ONLY time you become pregnant. Sperm can live inside for 5 days. You don't "become" pregnant after your period comes unless you have MORE sex.    Your period came, you are ok. 37 days after sex day would be WAY long enough to get a + if you were.    You had a close call, and you have the right idea. No more sex. Not worth it. You will have to live with the regret of loosing your virginity in this way (any penetration at all and you are no longer virgin), but at least it will prevent a future disaster.    Be careful.|`|i3pn4jNcaa	you are NOT pregnant|`|yfp1ug8Laa	wow OBVIOUSLY you're not pregnant if you got your period.    ps: pre ejaculate doesnt have sperm =]|`|XLsnuAqmaa	you aren't pregnant.  if you had your full period after you took the pills they did their job.  and it sounds like you wouldn't have been pregnant in the first place either even if you wouldn't have taken them.  sheesh.|`|sA1ztaEpaa	You're not pregnant..

uMIvRRjoaa	Kellymom has some great info on how to safely lose weight while bfing:  http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/mom/mo...      The best thing I was able to do was watch portion size. I got so used to eating a little constantly (to keep all day sickness away) that I had forgotten proper portion size. I went for walks with my little one in a front pack (extra weight lol), and took it easy actually until after 6 months because cutting back and exercising too much did cause a dip in my supply (won't for everyone!). It wasn't until after 12 months pp though that I was able to drop to 10 pounds above my prepreggo weight. And I still had giganto boobs so I know that accounted for about 5 of it. LOL! Just have faith it will come off. I looked at it as it took 9 months to gain, it would take at least 9 to come off. Some people are luckier, but since I've always battled my weight I didn't want t yo-yo, kwim?     GL!!|`|8026ec062aaa229b35c5aceb76a16035aa	Keep breastfeeding!

You can find a couple different ones on netflix.  It really helped tone up the stomach muscles as well as everything else, plus the baby was involved too, so I didn't have to try to find time when the baby was napping.  Walking with the baby in a sling or stroller works too, and you can wear ankle weights around the house while you're cleaning which doesn't take extra time but still burns calories.  And remember, they say that you only need an extra 500 calories a day while breastfeeding, so look at the labels of the snacks you're eating, those little calories add up fast.  Good luck!!!|`|wOc5cInNaa	I am also 8 weeks p.p. and breastfeeding; obviously it is not recommended that you go on any kind of diet because it would affect your milk supply. I have not started any kind of exercise routine yet but I think that exercise videos would be ideal...that way you can work out at home while your little one is sleeping and if you SWEAT it out I am sure you'll get the results...good luck! :-)|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I do a lot of pilates and yoga. I have the dvds and I use them at home, saves me a trip to the gym so it's easier with a baby. Other than that, just eat healthy.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Just eat a healthy balanced diet and avoid junk.  Breastfeeding itself burns lots of calories, so eating sensibly WILL cause you to lose weight. If you want a specific program, Weight Watchers has a plan for nursing moms.    Do be aware that some moms seem to just hang onto the last 5-10 pounds no matter what they do.  It's probably nature's way of protecting mama and baby against unexpected famine.  So if you find yourself in that position ... just accept it.  The weight should come off once baby is weaned.|`|VUIEnZpnaa	Well usually losing weight after birth is natural and comes with time. So im sure a regular workout and some healthy eating habbits would help jump start it. If you ever get time go jog, and my wrestling coach always tells me to eat alot of SMALL meals instead of a few BIG meals that helps keep your metabolism working and in turn helps loose some weight|`|VzOokYEqaa	i signed up at curves 3 weeks ago and am losing 2-3 lbs a week. thats what you want to lose while nursing. that way you will still have a good milk supply.|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	I cut down on carbs and get lots of fruits, veggies and water. Plus lean protein and lots of fiber.     I have three kids so I get a lot of exercise right there... I also keep my birthing ball around to bounce on. I sit on it at night when I'm vegging out in front of the tv. I also park at the back of parking lots. Hauling all three kids into the store has got to burn a lot of calories. And I always take the stairs vs an escalator or elevator.
Z1e3Cxjoaa	I don't think my nipples have been soft since I found out I was pregnant and they are always sensitive but every woman is different.  You might have a hormonal imbalance since you can't get a period until you ovulate and doesn't sound like you ovulated yet.
90zcKChJaa	you may have a little belly on ya by then, but that's good! You can get married whereever you want to no matter of you are preggo or not.|`|W1p6LetFaa	How many weeks will you be at the time of the wedding?  Most women do not start to really show until about 5 months or even later, but everyone is different, because I was obviously pregnant at about 3.5 months. Also, every church is different.  They might not let you get married if they know you are pregnant, but for the most part, it's kind of one of those "Don't ask, don't tell" sort of things.  You probably won't be that big at the time and most people aren't going to ask you if you are pregnant unless they are absolutely SURE you are.  If you dress appropriately at the rehearsal and wear a flattering wedding dress, you most likely won't look pregnant or people will only speculate but won't be sure.  Good luck to you and congrats on your little one!|`|UaL28atDaa	I'm pretty sure you can as long as you have not been married in a church before. Also it really does depend on you but its possible you will be showing at least a little. This video explains where abouts you and your baby will be in terms of development at that stage. Its also a great site for pregnant moms once you've solved the wedding dialema lol      http://pregnancy.healthguru.com/content/...|`|AA10153923	Do it, who cares. The right thing to do is get married anyways. People are people, but God looks at us different than the Catholic church or people. Your doing the right thing Don't you worry.|`|wxBFZ41Taa	Yes, you can get married in the Catholic Church even if you are pregnant.     It depends on your body how much you'll be showing at that time.|`|0dd7cabdea5b9d991d838d3e770488a1aa	OK for starters, I'm not catholic, I'm baptist.   I realize it's important for you to get married in the church, but isn't it just as important not to be living a lie at the altar of your church?  A lie about your own child?  Just tell the priest the truth - you're hardly the first and you won't be the last catholic girl to get pregnant.   Your priest may tell you that if it was truly important to you to get married at the altar, then you would have avoided sex prior to your marriage, and he'd be right so just accept your lumps.  My understand is that the priest would still marry you, just not at the altar. Well, big deal - you'll still be married in the eyes of God.  Please don't forget - it's the marriage that's important, not the wedding.|`|yfp1ug8Laa	HAHAH|`|GjuRYsITaa	you know what it use to be like i got broat up to believe sex before marriage was a sin and all that but saying that people do get married once they've had kids so who knows|`|yW9R8mapaa	My church wouldn't marry my sister because she had a baby. I don't know if they'll know or not, but if you get married in the church, you'd be lying to the church and that's kinda wrong. You'd probably be able to hide it though.|`|nAcpOb0saa	Honey I'm 22 weeks and just started to show i was 120 when i got pregnant. dont worry. U can get married anywhere you want when your pregnant times have changed. I got married in a church in october and i was pregnant. congrats and god bless|`|FMpHtZnBaa	you will be showing. You  would look prego so its up too you
b486f83b6ee2472d2a116996e7df0f66aa	I went in for an induction and was given Cervadil at 7am.  I was then sent home and by 12 ( lunchtime)  I was feeling the contractions.  I ended up going into the hospital 9pm that night and I had almost completely finished effacing and I was 2cm dilated (from nothing at all).  I still ended up getting the pitocin but the Cervadil helped getting me there.|`|AA10186411	I had to have Cervadil with my induction.  After a few hours I was asleep, and then awoke to the most horrible pain I have EVER felt.  It had started these insanely painful and close to together contractions.  They had to take it out because it was putting my daughter in distress. Needless to say, it didn't ripen anything and I ended up having a c-section!  Not trying to scare you lol   A friend of mine had it and everything went smoothly :)
ROJans2Taa	I had a membrane sweep done at 39 weeks, I was 2 cm dilated, it sent me right into labor, I started contracting right away and delivered my son 17 hrs after. I had a good experience with it, it sounds to me like you should go into labor soon, best luck|`|FMpHtZnBaa	Yes it does work. It could be anytime now so be ready lol .
vOomJtbsaa	Ohhh Yay Momma the prego dust worked!  I think you should run out and buy like a plus or minus sign tests, ept or first response are both good choices.  Sounds like you're in denial.... when I first found out I was pregnant, I spent about 30 bucks on tests, and I took all of them (3 in each box).... I kept screaming ..."This can't be real, this can't be real".... and giggling in delight LOL :)    I hope it's positive :)|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	Just go to a DR.|`|nrQijvMuaa	Get another Cheap Pregnancy test! Better than paying $15 for one at the clinic. Or if not why don't you go to a free pregnancy clinic?|`|FgAPXhVRaa	Well first off congrats if you are a mommy again!!!! Secondly, the dollar store sells pregnancy tests for $1, so it's worth the money. I used one when I missed my period and it worked fine!!! So that is what I would do instead of spending $15 at the doctor's office! Then after that you can make whatever appointments and stuff you need to but really the $ store's work just as well as any other tests!|`|hGNvbC6oaa	I'd just go buy another for under $10.00.  The ones in the walk in doc's office are basically the same type as the ones you can buy, but for way cheaper!  I'd wanna do another if I were you, just to be sure you're actually getting a positive.|`|vOTcVMsdaa	You can order them very cheaply online for 92 cents each on this website:     http://www.early-pregnancy-tests.com/pre...    You do have to spend a minimum of $5 so I ordered 6 tests. They are very accurate. Many doctors use them.    Hope this helps|`|1EwbKkKCaa	If there's two lines you're pregnant. A lot of obgyn's will do a free urine test though. Try calling the ones in your area.|`|DNygQdmVaa	i would test with another store bought one in a day or two, then go from there.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	you can buy a pregnancy test for cheaper than $15 and do it conveniently at home :)|`|LKIhUMCgaa	if it was positive (2 lines), then no, don't waste ur money, make the doctor appointment and they'll do another test for u to confirm that u're pregnant, so instead of u taking another test, they'll give u one. even 1 positive means u're pregnant. gratz :D|`|Pf9fyEyQaa	I would go to the dollar store and buy 15 tests for $1 each!  Or at least a couple of them haha.  Better than wasting your money on the doctors until you know for sure, especially since sometimes their tests aren't as accurate as ones you can buy yourself.  Good luck!|`|AA10186411	The urine tests at the doctor as the exact same as the ones you buy at the store.  If you are sure it was a positive, I wouldn't waste money on another one.  But if you aren't 100% sure, I would buy another in a few days or go to the doctor anyways.|`|AA11603468	You aren't even due for your period yet. What I would do is stop taking tests until I was late, and then act based on those results.|`|EAzyjftKaa	Well ahve some patience wait untill you officail miss period wait about a week and the go to the doctor pay $15.00 dollars ang get your results. Don;t stress out this can make you skip periods making you think you are pregnant.
fHjSonssaa	Becasue of the protein and high blood pressure- this isn't something to mess around with.  Call or go to Birth Center/Hospital.  They will prbably check your blood pressure and check protein again.    Then determine how to go forward.  But don't contimplate- as pre-eclampsia can prgress fast|`|FEzmVmFjaa	I would call and let your doctor know about your face and hands swelling, because along with the protein, they're signs of preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is alot more serious than alot of people think. go to www.preeclampsia.com or.org I can't remember..  Also, maybe you are having an allergic reaction to something? But I would just call and let an on call nurse or doctor know what's goin on.|`|XE45S6OTaa	I would go to the emergency room or call your doctor.  Where ever you think you would be treated the fastest.  It could be nothing as it is usual to retain some water the last few weeks, but it could be a sign of something worse.|`|cdCGo0vHaa	Call our doctor now!!  I mean, he may tell you that it's nothing, but I would not hesitate to call him immediately.  If there is any sort of problem, you don't want to wait.  Good luck!  I hope it's nothing!|`|rxeGMKnbaa	Call your doctor. Facial swelling may be a sign the the high blood pressure is getting worse. You are far enough along now that they can deliver the baby if they have to.
ALbWt2ylaa	It depends on what you plan on calling her. Do you plan on using the two names together all the time? (as in "Emma Lynn") If that's the case, then I'd put them together as one name - Emalyn is my favorite spelling - it's simple and sounds like it's spelled.     On the other hand, if you're just going to call her "Emma", and use the "Lynn" purely as a middle name, then I like "Emma Lynn".|`|d6e11chxaa	I don't think it's weird at all. If anything, it's really cutesy and common right now. Think about how common Emily, Emma, Olivia, and Emmalee are right now. It's very similar. If you really love it, I would use Emma Lynn. It's the simplest and the most obvious spelling. I would also try having your closest friends and family write down the name without any help or prompting from you and see what they come up with.|`|Hj5gAMdDaa	i like emma lynn|`|2LTumLwNaa	My favorite is Emma Lynn.|`|ibeYAlwpaa	I would use either emma lyn or emma lynn|`|0OtHu9Zmaa	I like Emma Lyn the best, but only if you are going to use Emma as the first name and Lyn as the middle name and don't use them together too often. If  you do, I think it's going to be a bit white-trashy (sorry!!!!). Kind of like Anna Nicole.|`|fbuaLXeIaa	I like Emmalynn.... I'm naming my daughter Emmalee!|`|YJGEEJhWaa	I think Emma Lynn as a whole name, x|`|Mgncbxg7aa	Emma Lynn is the best|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Emma Lynn is the best, but I'm not a fan. Emmeline is ok, but Emma is overused.|`|hCSLPz9Uaa	i think 2 names sounds bettter    i like Emma Lynn|`|eKtEWrcmaa	I would only use Emma Lynn or Emma Lyn. The others can all be pronounced completely wrong and look silly in my opinion.|`|h57t7FAjaa	I think Emma Lynn would be best, using two middle names.  I like it though, very cute :)|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Just spell it how it sounds  Emmalynn.  Its a pretty name.  You could even put an E on the end if you wanted|`|mZi7R0Enaa	Emlyn as a first name!|`|a0b83986209c3ad9a015c92f044e983eaa	Emma Lynn|`|ostF23Omaa	I don't like emmalynn but emma lynn as in two names are cute.|`|QnSKaBcjaa	i like two names better. it flows nicer. i like emma lynn|`|05f0422d6b7494f2a7dcefa19ad4600caa	I like it as both Emmalynn and Emma Lynn. Depends on how long your last name is.|`|3paE1E9Xaa	i think it sounds better as a first and middle and the best option for me is Emma Lynn|`|cSOkd7Umaa	i like Emma lynne
TJpQZju2aa	How great are those songs that moose sings?  My daughter knows all the words to the "why winter is fun" song.  LOL, I even catch myself singing those songs all the time.  Filling an entire time slot with them is a GREAT idea!|`|qPrMM2r6aa	Moose and Zee are adorable! I loved the winter songs, how cute! My sons love Moose and Zee. I would TiVo any Moose & Zee show!! They don't watch TV regularly, sometimes they go weeks without seeing TV shows (how lucky am I) but when they do want TV is when they don't feel good or are very sleepy but don't want to sleep. They're almost 2 and almost 3.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Yes, I do..I wouldn't watch lol but I know my daughter would be glued to the tv. One thing that annoys me about Noggin is after a certain time, they stop showing all the good shows. I have a hard time getting my daughter down because she wants to wait for her daddy to come home from work and 'The Upside Down Show" just doesn't cut it with getting her settled.|`|23MPcnNqaa	I have had that same thought go through my mind countless times!!    Now granted, my boys don't get a whole lot of tv time, but when they do, it's usually NOGGIN.  And they absolutely love Moose A. Moose and Zee.|`|3mb5IV1Zaa	We moved from a Noggin serviced area to a non Noggin serviced area, and every morning, my son asked for Zee. :o( We miss them! Wish Wish Wish they had a show of their own.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	That would be a good idea. I can only take so much of Yo Gabba Gabba without losing brain cells by the minutes|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	I can agree with you with Yo Gabba Gabba! I hate it! Luckily my son Liam he is 2, he is freaked out by the guy in the tights! My daughter doesnt like people in suits [shes 4]|`|Rn9SO1Wjaa	Yes! my daughter loves them!!|`|0aVHTRAEaa	Oh yes, she LOVES Moose and Zee and she also loves the Peppa Pig, she cracks up at them.  I wish they would make both of them shows.|`|PwmBdiEfaa	Yes. My son has the TV on but doesn't usually watch anything but Yo Gabba Gabba. But every time Moose and Zee comes on he stops playing and is just mesmerized by them. He also loves the songs that they sing. He wiggles and dances. Very cute!|`|c5186eac9c2b70e449f12d24a1aaec90aa	oh yeah we love moose and zee around here! It'd be sweet if they had their own show that replaced yo gabba gabba. I hate that show and it scares my three year old daughter lol. So she freaks when my other daughter watches it. Every kid I know likes moose and zee!!|`|ekAH05qWaa	i think that would be a cool idea.. but they kinda do have shows with them...well not really shows but like the little games that they have so its kind of like a show!
7rCeCVl2aa	I love him to death but when they put him on my chest and we were eye to eye I started hyper ventilating! They had to give me oxygen! I remember the nurse saying, "Slow down your breathing... slow it down... Take slower breaths you are going to pass out" It finally passed after a few minutes and my mind went numb. (In a good way!) I was speechless. My husband and I sat there in silence looking at him. It was beautiful!|`|rAkWoweOaa	I thought, Oh my God! He is so beautiful, he is finally here. I was bawling and screaming is he okay?|`|1Si9RlEXaa	I was in total amazement, then I cried. I couldn't believe how much I loved this tiny little person I just meet.|`|yCwPxulYaa	The first thing I said was "You look just like your daddy".    But my first thought was "I love you more then anything in this world and I have only known you for 30 seconds."    It was definitely the best day of my life.|`|B45065Plaa	OMG! Why is his head shape so wierd, why is he purple?    He's not purple amy more...hehe   He's gorgeous|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	i was hysterical crying with joy. i couldnt believe how precious and little they were.  it was the most amazing feeling in the world, when i had both my children.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	Why is he screaming so much?  Oh my God he's so slippery, I'm scared I'm going to drop him. Is somebody going to bath him.....?|`|SjX72fPyaa	Honestly I just cried. I couldn't believe after so long she was finally here.|`|HvALvdc7aa	I had a c section so I didn't get to hold her until I came out of the recovery room. When they handed her to me the 1 st thing that went through my head was" Is she gonna recognize my voice?' I was so worried that I wasn' t the 1st one to hold her she wouldn't recognize my voice. As soon as I spoke " hey baby" her eyes opened and she gazed at me. It was so sweet.|`|AzOXPFfVaa	I thought... so this is what the rest of my life will  be like.|`|OHq5gSjJaa	I did it!  A sense of accomplishment that I had delivered my baby and my husband and I had made something so perfect together.|`|3paE1E9Xaa	I thought when the nurse slipped him into my arms he slipped right in to my heart.    Now that he's 2, I always tell him: No matter how old you are my baby you'll always be and he gives me a big hug.|`|heDtLdz5aa	i thought..wow!! this is what love really is...i don't think anyone will understand this until they have a child of their own...i understood how much my parents truely loved me...and how much love they were filled with...they had 5 kids..|`|ldcs7OdXaa	I had to have a c-section but honestly the first thing I thought was his lips weren't as big as we thought they were going to be. Haha.|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	oh my god he looks like me!|`|ClC962UDaa	I don't think many thoughts are actually going through your head when the moment happens. I felt more than I thought. My feelings were pride and a sense of accomplishment, astonishment that something this big just came out of my body, pleasure in hearing her tiny voice screaming, and extreme exhaustion. My husband and I both cried, me because I miscarried and was sooooooo looking forward to this tiny life, and him because he was proud of the life we had created and amazed at her perfection.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	I thought I was the luckiest person in the whole world, and how beautiful each one of them were.|`|1S7uXsInaa	With my 1st I do not think that I had a thought for quite some time.  I remember that I was hungry. . .I had not eaten in over 24 hours.  My 2nd was rushed to the NICU so I was terrified until I could go see him.|`|AA10717561	I cant believe I made this-hes perfect|`|0MhJOP6xaa	I kept throwing up and had to keep handing her back to my partner , so I was thinking gosh is this really a bad sign!!!!!  how wrong was I , it was instant crush, but a gradual love thing, she is 9 months old and I have never loved anything more.|`|zG740RHuaa	holy crap, that just came out of me???? that's was inside my stomach? and she's so cute and not as bloody as i thought she'd be. she looks like a normal baby. lol|`|ibeYAlwpaa	this may seem bad, now that ive read other peoples responses... but my first thought was i wonder if i can have some apple juice yet....|`|nxHztcslaa	omg its a real baby!! I was fascinated and up until that moment couldn't convince myself everything was gonna be okay with her and she would arrive safe...thank god she did!! then i wondered how she came out white with blue eyes hahahaha...was my first baby and i didnt know they got darker through time... feel silly now! haha|`|ZadTQtJaaa	Honestly, I was so happy he was out of my tummy!  I saw the baby, cried, gave him a kiss... then I had to puke.    The next day after I was feeling better, it was love at first sight and the most amazing feeling ever.|`|0ca6f6ce6afa279f3ccc449197fd3d7daa	..HES MINE!!! Oh my god I can't believe he's actually here! And then I cried a little.. :)|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	Wow...we made this.  and  I can't believe I'm a mother.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	To be perfectly honest, I had an anxiety attack of sorts during my c-section.  As soon as they got the baby out, they gave me a shot of morphine to calm me down.  When they put the baby in my arms I thought "Why are they handing me a baby?  I'm sooooo high."    If I had the option, I'd have had that go differently. ;)|`|68c6B8dRaa	OH! She's PERFECT!|`|SDjrojZXaa	FINALLY! We had fertility problems and concieved through insemination after 5 years....when my son come out they took him straight to the weigh in then measure and i kept yelling and crying " i want to see my baby i want to hold him give me my baby" then they put him in my arms i could breath again and i fell madly in love with my beautiful boy. (my husband said it was only like a minute that he was with the nurses but it felt like an hour to me)|`|zQWNb6neaa	After I stopped counting fingers and toes, my first thought was "Red Hair!?". My older two had dark brown hair at birth so a full head of red hair took us pleasantly by surprise ;).     I understand what your friend means by wearing his heart outside of his body. You will too, after your little one is born.

WXIoUwIBaa	Twin showers can be so much fun and there are a lot of things that you can do to make the shower twins themed.  First, I would recommend reading a few themes for twins.  One of the most popular ones is peas in a pod.  I would recommend visiting http://www.baby-shower.com/themes/peas-i... for ideas for a twins theme.  Another great theme is Double your Fun.  You can read it at http://www.baby-shower.com/themes/double...    In regards to games for twins, here are a few suggestions.    1. Juggling Twins:  This is similar to hot potato where guests sit in a circle and pass two dolls around while music is playing. Whenever the music stops, the guest holding one of the babies is eliminated.  The last person in the circle wins.    2. Celebrity Twins:  This can be done in two ways.  The first is to have pictures of babies and celebrities out. The guests need to identify the twins and which celebrity had the twins. The second way is to identify which celebrity is a twin. You would be surprised but there are quite a few of them out there.    3. Guess Babies' time of birth: This can be done with one, two or more babies.  Basically, you take two plastic baby miniatures and freeze them in a small cup of water.  At the shower, guests are given a slip of paper and an ice cube containing two babies and they have to write down their name and when they think their babies will be free of the ice.  At that point, they will need to free their babies from the ice cube without using hot or running water.  The person who guessed correctly wins.    For more game ideas, I would recommend going to http://www.baby-shower.com/d-games/95003...    All the best,    www.baby-shower.com|`|xx8M1RNuaa	I always find great ideas and printable items like invitations and favors at http://www.invitations-and-more.com/ You might want to check it out.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	Your theme could be something like "Two peas in a pod".
N34q6jlBaa	I'm having a boy and I haven't been sick once throughout my entire pregnancy. I have also carried him very low. I've gained about 60 lbs and it's mostly in my stomach I feel smaller everywhere else.  For me though I just knew I kept catching myself referring to him as a "he" before we found out. I went to my 20 week sonogram and said will you check and see if "he's" a boy or girl and the nurse got after me because she said I didn't know for sure yet =)  Good luck!   Oh and I went and bought one of those silly tests that tell you if it's a boy/girl and the test told me it was a boy and that was at 13 weeks!|`|LKIhUMCgaa	some people say ur skin breaks out a lot while pregnant with a girl, some say u get really bad morning sickness, i didn't have either of those, my skin cleared up big time, and i was a little nauseous in my first trimester, but never threw up or anything.    i figured out what i was having before i had the u/s to confirm it by some old wives tales that have been known to be right every time for my family and friends. my belly was round, i carried her like a watermelon, i noticed how much the belly grew into my sides from the beginning cuz i always had very curvy waist, and then even when i wasn't showing much of a belly yet, i noticed how i had some extra weight on the sides of my waist. also i craved chocolate a lot lol couldn't stand sour, and her heartbeat was always above 150.|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	I am having a girl and I noticed I really want sweets, my tummy is very round and full, and I didn't really have morning sickness.  Also my babies heart beat was 165 at my first appointment and then each time I went after that it stayed around 155-160.  I have always heard the faster the heart beat then it is probably a girl, for boys is it usually between 140-150.|`|jk6ayFUmaa	well i have heard that if you crave red meat such as steaks and stuff over fruits you are having a boy. and if you dont feel pretty during your pregnancy from breakouts and stuff you are having a girl because you daughter takes you beauty. and this one is weird if you pee like a neon yellow i think it said you are having a boy.|`|ostF23Omaa	with my son I didn't gain that much weight at all. It was like a little basketball was in the shirt. And I think I carried him very low. I am now pregnant with my second and I think I'm carrying a bit higher and I'm not as sick as I was with my son either. So it may be a girl, who knows!|`|gN9Kc2q7aa	i think this is different for every women.    with my daughter, i fainted twice and put on weight all round. I had no morning sickness and the last month, i couldnt sleep for more then 4-5 hours per 24    with my son, i had morning sickness for the first 5 months, i was badly constipated, had terrible cramps in my calfs towards the end and slept like a baby.|`|NI8D46J0aa	I have 2 boys and 2 girIs. With the girIs, I was really ill. With the boys, I barely got sick at all. I was also way more emotional when I was pregnant with my girIs.  I am pregnant with my 5th (about 14 weeks) , but I would have to say it's a girI, too. I have been pretty sick.  Good luck with whatever you are having. :)|`|0cs6HqxIaa	from what i have noticed with my friends and my own pregnancy. is that when carrying a girl you kinda carry everywhere your legs your sides your face most of your body will get bigger. However when your carrying a boy you carry more just in the stomach maybe some of the sides but mostly belly. Hoped this helps :)
Dxxz5s7Vaa	You might want to talk to your doctor about doing an allergy test to see if it is from pet dander.     You might want to get special air filters for your home.     Maybe hire professional cleaners.|`|MQ83HGD5aa	It's probably allergy related. Have you gotten the carpets professionally cleaned? You can rent a cleaner also..that's an option. Or your next one would be to move to a different complex.|`|Hr81nt2Vaa	this happen to my friend,get ur air ducks clean in ur home that might help,it could be allgerys|`|i7oGjwJBaa	i would also consider other environmental things than the pet dander - although that's a good possibility.  there could also be mold in the air that she is sensative to, etc.
9109f41fd6f3533ebb276e93924ad7f7aa	wow ur full of s**t. you answered someone elses q saying u were 13 and enjoyed romps wit ur da, that makes you one hell of a pathetic loser. get some else cos noone who knows u must like ur lies|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I agree with the Watchman lady. You're allowing this to go on and you're sitting around whining about it. That girl needs some serious, hardcore parenting right now. Get off the internet and go let your daughter know this shyt is about to end right this minute. This isn't a game. Your daughter is playing with her life right now and you're sitting around wringing your hands trying to ground her. She needs way more than grounding. You're not her friend. You're her PARENT. Act like one.|`|r07BwhO1aa	She is 12 not 21 beat her @ss!!  If she wants to act like a grown up punish her like one!!    Normal 12 year olds do not act like this, YOU as her parent missed the mark some where along the line and now YOU as the parent need to get her back on track, who cares if she hates you, you need to lay down the law in your home.    Parents in cases like these are not meant to be friends with their child they need to be JUDGE, JURRY, & EXECUTIONER.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Don't TRY...DO!|`|4DoXomHZaa	You are obviously not capable of handling this on your own. It got to where it is for a reason. You don't feel like you can control her.    Send her to a reformatory or boot camp, or if worse comes to worse, foster care with people who can deal with this sort of out of control ridiculousness.    Weak parenting is what got you here, it will keep you here. You don't "try" to ground her, you put your foot in her azz and lock her down. She doesn't get a choice YOU are the parent.|`|xdqxkgEVaa	how come you did not see any signs of this earlier on.  you need to take action and fast.  and it is too late for grounding|`|BNAzjSO1aa	I am sorry but YOU are the adult in this situation and you need to remind her of that. When you ground her keep her in the same room as you do not let her sneak out. If she is going to behave like a spoilt brat treat her like one. Stop any privileges make sure that her bedroom contains the essentials no phones, tv's music players etc. Walk her to school and tell her until she earns your trust you will keep on doing these things. Try to discover the reason for her behaviour? maybe talk to the school and see if they can offer her some help but do it now before something horrible happens|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	What she honestly needs is to be put in a group home with troubled teens so she can be deprogrammed and hopefully not die of a drug overdose before she graduates or wind up pregnant.  Find a local bootcamp for troubled teens - they are tough, but if you truly love your child, you need to get her some help!|`|LU7WB6Poaa	Send her off to a boot camp that deals with problem children like your daughter.|`|fQ18TyyKaa	I agree with MOST of the other posts. You really need to think about what you are NOT doing to and for your daughter. Get her some professional help before she winds up dead, pregnant, or worse.

b2dffdde9d95855452a59a5a7564c914aa	I applaud you for reading with him daily.  This is one of the best things you can do. The other thing you can do is to let him 'catch you' and the other family members reading as part of a daily routine...books, magazines, whatever.  Families that read for recreation create a natural envirionment for piquing reading interest in their children.      In addition to this, I recommend taking him routinely to the public library and help him select books which contain subjects that interest him.  The children's librarian can assist you with this.    Also, if the school system does not teach phonics, help him to sound out unfamiliar words he does not know by breaking them down into smaller bits.  This is sometimes called 'word attack skills'.      Schedule a meeting with the teacher and ask if there is a reading assistance program.  Ask how your child can become enrolled in it.  It may take some persistence on your part to get him in (such programs are often under-funded and they take on a limited number of students).     If this is not readily available, ask the teacher for a child-study of your son's reading skills.  This is where the teacher and reading specialist (among other staff) observe you son during his reading lessons and throughout the day over a period of time to see where his reading problems occur.  At the end of the study, they will meet and make recommendations to help him with his reading.  Again, be persistent.  Start with the teacher.  Move on to the Reading Specialist and involve the principal if necessary.  Don't take 'No' for an answer.  Persistence pays.    Sometimes kids, particualrly boys, are late bloomers.      Good luck to you and your son.|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	Try not to worry too much about his reading, concentrate on encouraging a love of books. There is a strong correlation between children's love of reading and the amount they are read to by their parents (or other people)    For now, concentrate on encouraging a love of books and read to your child as often as you can, make reading to him something that he knows you enjoy, and make sure he grows up in a home where books are all around, cook books, recipe books, map books, dictionaries, atlases, books about animals, books about the holidays, about other countries, books of jokes and riddles, books of adventure stories - surround him with literacy, and he WILL love books!    Maybe you could make a family tradition of turning the TV off after dinner and everybody reads a book of some kind for half an hour.    Maybe have him tell you a story that he has made up, you can write it down, he can illustrate it and you can bind it with wallpaper and make it into a "real" book - he might like to read it to his friends, Grandmas & Grandpas, Aunts & Uncles.    Encourage literacy in many ways - write notes, shopping lists, thank-you notes to Grandparents, post-cards from holidays, lists of things for gifts for Christmas, have him jot things down for you that you want to remember.|`|I4KqAZThaa	Online reading programs - They are highly effective and enjoyable programs which teach little kids and babies to read making the process fun and not something of a torture.  Ababycanread is an excellent online program for reading.   Your son might be a little older for this but it is def worth a shot.|`|6nUprmu5aa	How old is he? We taught our kids to read before Kindergarten, but only because they were cooperative. Maybe have him tested for dyslexia? If that's not the problem, let him learn on it on his own. My friend's son is 7 and can't read. If he asks what something says, they just tell him. I don't think that's the right thing to do. They should tell him to read it himself. Pretty soon there will come a time in his life where he'll WANT to know what something says.|`|0VJE7BXmaa	Try flashcards.  Start with words.  Let him master a set, and then move on to harder words.  Then start showing the same simple sentences and building up to more difficult sentences.  This will help to build his confidence.  The repetition will be good for him also.  Make it a fun and relaxed time, and do not punish him if he gets it wrong.  Get out some snacks and do this sometime in the evening.  This will really help him to connect reading with confidence, fun, and it will help him not to get so anxious at school.  I think teachers over do it sometimes, and he may be feeling too much pressure to really learn and progress.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	first I agree with the first poster, you should get him assessed for a learning disability such as dyslexia, the school should have something in place to arrange for the assessment so talk to them.  What ever the outcome of the assessment it is  not impossible for him to become a good reader, but practise is the key. Let him choose his own books so he gets ones that peak his interest and try comic books and graphic novels. Comics and graphic novels are written at a really high level, but the pictures help readers to figure out what's going on and keep them interested. Just remember to check through the whole book before you let him read it as some are very graphic with nudity and sexual content, drug use, serious violence etc.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	First:  please have child evaluated by child psychologist for possibility of Dysgraphia/Dyslexia.     Second:  schedule meeting with teacher and principal about the timed reading,which is archaic.
r39EDGhPaa	Well, you can't take it back now.  So don't regret it.  I don't know why you would base your entire decision on what either of them have to say.    You were the one who gave birth.  Not to make you feel worse about it, but their opinions should not have impacted your decision so much.|`|ft8t98Pnaa	first... how old are you and how old is your baby? No you didnt do the right thing. You knew what you were getting in to before you got pregnant. you need to live up to your responsibilities. your going to get a lot of nasty answers from people so expect it...     Your going to feel regret for a while...and your going to feel guilty.. there is nothing you can do about it now. whats done is done.. maybe next time you decide to have sex and get prego.. you'll think about it... a baby changes everything!!!!! and that is the truth.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	nobody deserves to be given away for a mistake that someone else did. your baby did not have the fault that you did not want her. there are so many people who do anything to keep their children even if they are poor.|`|AA10041941	if your already questioning if you did the right thing or not then I think you already answered your own question :( so sad...sorry!|`|nxHztcslaa	you did the right thing by having your baby and not having an abortion like so many people... of course you are gonna have doubts if it only happened yesterday..mums do the best for their babies and sometimes that means doing something that hurts.. you said yourself you couldnt handle a baby at your age so yes you did the right thing...get some support and never forget your baby...|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	If you are young, and you really believe you couldn't do it, then you did the right thing. There are so many people out there who would love to have children, and can't. Just think of it this way...you made someone else's life amazing.|`|iYRBbpGWaa	As long as you make sure that the baby is in good care and that whoever has the baby lets her know that her mom gave her up for good reasons and that her mom loved her very much, I think it was a good thing. If you yourself can't take care of the baby, then if you really loved her you would want what's best for her and that would be a family that can support her and love her, too. Don't be mad at yourself.|`|YCnDnHh5aa	You really do sound very immature to have a baby.  Maybe you did the right thing.|`|D2dLByLsaa	If you know that you would not be able to provide and care for your child Then yes giving her up for adopting was the right thing to do, for her . As long as you made sure she goes to a loving family that can and will take care of her and you know will not hurt her or make her go with out.  You should always do what is  the best for your child, which is being with there mom and dad only if they can take care of them.|`|5aJ6E3JFaa	Oh hun, I'm sorry.  I think that a large part of you though must have agreed with him that it WAS the right thing or you would not have done it.  It's understandable that you would have second thoughts in this emotional time, especially after a fight, and also with all of those hormones still running through your system probably (depending how long ago you had the baby).   If it is a situation where you felt pressured, manipulated or controlled into this decision, it is very unfortunate - but I still tend to think that if you knew in your heart of hearts that you COULD handle a baby at your age then you would not have made this decision.  It is OK to be at peace w/ allowing your baby to have a family that CAN handle parenthood at this point in their lives, that is a wonderful gift to have given her as a mother - safety and security.  Good luck to you  :)
537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	I had a preemie at 32 weeks, but remember being so overwhelmed,(we didnt even have carseats yet, and just rambled thru Target, putting things in the cart, basically in a trance)  Our baby was in the level 2, and got a lot of info from great nurses there.    I do see amazon has premature birth guide books, but another thing Id recommed is bringing in some books to the NICU/Level 2 to just read outloud to your baby and also do kangaroo care.    Also look into your local March of Dimes chapter, or the national website.  I see they have good resources  http://www.marchofdimes.com/minnesota/43...    and message boards, and could maybe hook you up to other parents.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I starred your question because I am interested in it but don't have an answer.  I had a basically  healthy baby who was only slightly pre-term, but yes, there is a lot more anxiety surrounding the birth of a pre-term baby, however healthy they are.  Medical personal and family tend to treat them as "sick". Decisions and advice can sometimes be based more on the date of their birth than the actual state of the baby.  My son was not in the NICU, so I can't speak to that experience.    My one piece of advice is that when your baby is healthy and you get him home, try not to let the anxiety surrounding circumstances of his birth affect too much the way you and other people treat him.  It's hard, being a new mom is stressful enough.  But I think I had trouble enjoying my son as much as I could have because his surprise birth and issues right after birth made him a source of great anxiety.
miPubuDYaa	With my first pregnancy i didn't notice not one. And you would think i would have had like a zillion because i went from being 118 pounds to 165 in three months (from the time i was 5.5 months pregnant to 8.5 month pregnant i gained almost 50 pounds.    With this pregnancy i noticed one around week 23. I still only have the one but it got alittle longer.  i'm 27 weeks and i only gained 22 pounds so far.|`|AA10186411	At 32 weeks exactly I had 2 as well.  By the time I hit about 38, my stomach was COVERED in them.  Not just little ones, big thick ones.  So yeah, it looks pretty messed up now lol|`|8WRnqs08aa	With my first pregnancy, I developed stretch marks on my breast with in the first month & they got worse as my pregnancy went on. I went from a 36 C to a 40 E after delivery, then they reduced & stayed at a 38 DD.    I didn't develop a single stretch mark on my belly until I became over due. My stretch marks are white, not red, so fortunately they faded as I lost weight.|`|W1p6LetFaa	I thought I was going to make it through the pregnancy without a single stretch mark, but then BAM at 35 weeks they popped up all over.  I now have 3 on each side of my belly for a total of 6.  I've been lathering up the lotion throughout the entire pregnancy, however, so they don't look that bad, but they're definitely there.  Bummer!  Good luck to you and your little one!!|`|frvbZ6auaa	With my first I only had one stretch mark show up while I was still pregnant, the rest showed their ugly face after I had my baby and my tummy shrank back down. I did everything I was supposed to to try and prevent them, but they showed up anyways. So with my other two pregnancies they were already there. Didn't get much worse though so that is a plus. I just keep putting lotion with Vitamin E in it on my tummy and hope for the best!!|`|EAzyjftKaa	I did too only got 2 big ones and a few small ones right before she was born about 2-3 weeks before they all dissapear right after she was born but the 2 big are still there and they hurt. the doctor said they where pretty bad and maybe laser would be needed, to prevent a hernia in the feature. My daughter is 3.5 know.  If you use Almond Oil from Jafra that work that how my stretchmark got away exept the 2 because after they showed up i found the oil.The rest are all gone.|`|d463c686f5093f6cd2cd7e58248297a4aa	I just had twins in October and went through the whole thing with no stretch marks.|`|ldcs7OdXaa	Well I started getting stratch marks around your time; but sometimes you get very few, depending how much elastic your skin is.|`|0uhRgfcsaa	28 weeks, and theyve only gotten worse :( i tried every cream and lotion available to man kind too.|`|WSbfkuSZaa	I'm 20 weeks and don't see any on my belly. My breasts however have them on the sides. They were already big and now they're HUGE! I hate how they look.|`|eO4y3m1maa	Once the skin starts to be stretched is when you start to develop them.  Just stay heavily moisturized, when you sleep put a nice coat of lotion on your breasts, stomach and hips...that way you won't have to worry about any even small signs!       Everyone is different, tiny girls you'd think would get them easier...but sometimes they dont get them at all.|`|ostF23Omaa	I didn't get that many stretch marks. I was probably 7 or 8 month before I got any.|`|hGNvbC6oaa	I was 28 weeks when I first notice a few tiny ones on my stomach pop up.  I thought they wouldn't get bad.  Pfft!  They exploded in the next few weeks and my stomach was covered from my belly button below.|`|nCKdkYSyaa	well I didnt notice ANY until I gave birth and came home and THEN i noticed them,     and i thought i was lucky! LOL WRONG! they suprised me on my inner thighs and sides of my hips.|`|O5WberWnaa	im 30wks 2morrow and i got a few more at 26wks+thats when they started comming.big red ones on my hips and my boobs.|`|N83Po9PZaa	Seven months....use lotion, cream, anything you can get your hands on. It won't stop them all, but it does help, seeing as how I had five kids and never added more than what I got with the first one. DON'T forget your boobs, butt, lower back and calves....you'd be surprised were those nasty boogers show up.|`|8YltlMsjaa	everyone is different|`|Yr65nHRkaa	At about 30 weeks my stomach slowly started turning into a train track.  I had noticed some on my sides before then, though.    ENJOY! :)|`|OU9xnW86aa	I feel so unlucky...I have two little faint ones on the sides of my belly button already and I am only 16w2d. I have two in the side of each hip and a few of each breast as well. Everyone else seems to get them later on so I can only imagine the horror I will look like later on in my pregnancy if I am already getting them now! :(|`|2B2fgmw9aa	:( I just got mine at 24 weeks....
q4rG5Dwtaa	sick sick sick|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	lol this is a new one!!!    use the clothes dryer for now, until you can get a new hair dryer|`|JP2h62qiaa	Give him so cocaine. That may do the trick ;)|`|QnSKaBcjaa	get to the er. twitching is never good. he probably shocked himself!|`|qStmw7qgaa	You are complaining about a hair dryer and you child electrocuted himself!?!?!  You need therapy, and your soon needs to go to the emergency room!!!|`|t9S0dqfLaa	This has got to be some very stupid joke, noone can be that retarded and still be able to type.  BTW, get a life!|`|l5A9QXVzaa	This can't be a real question, but just in case it is, call 911. Sometimes i wonder why the Lord lets some people have children. Obviously your child means less to you than a freaking blow dryer. You make me sick!|`|DNZI2MtBaa	CALL 911!|`|AC1v9v4Saa	COME ON, you gotta be joking!! Take him to the ER room immediately or call 911.  If this is serious and you want to wait until people give you advise to go to the hospital you are crazy.  Also I don't think you should be worried about getting to the mall to replace your hair dryer.  If you are for real, you need child services involved.
e9m6Y4bfaa	I don't know why people are being so mean about it.    I'm not sure if it's going to come up but here's a picture of my belly at 6 months. I'm 7 months pregnant now.    http://i128.photobucket.com/albums/p175/...  http://i128.photobucket.com/albums/p175/...|`|nrQijvMuaa	What 4?|`|nYnlYAE1aa	I don't think the person who asked the question is a perv or anything. If you look at their other questions it sounds like they are 13 weeks and not showing. I think they are just curious about where they should be now with their belly.|`|eO4y3m1maa	does it turn you on? that's kind of creepy|`|1EwbKkKCaa	That is sort of an odd thing to want?? does it get you off or something.|`|OU9xnW86aa	Let me take one and see if I can get it up here...gimme a minute.    Ok, here's my belly at 16weeks2days: http://i39.tinypic.com/2bcqcn.jpg|`|WSbfkuSZaa	That would take entirely too much time to take a picture, upload it to some site, and then copy it on here. You should just look up pregnancy information, there are lots of pictures of pregnant bellies on the web.|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	even easier - go to photobucket and do a search - all sorts of pregnant bellies on there.|`|DI8o8r1Caa	Actually that is pretty creepy.  Why do you want to see that?|`|Y4DPDmrfaa	people arent very nice. i would show you a picture but i dont have a recent one.
MtC3CWZraa	I could see a difference early in my second trimester but I was close to the end of the second if not the start of the third before it was obvious to other people.     I'm not a heavy girl, but I am tall and that seems to be affecting how I'm carrying. At 38 weeks, people still tell me on a daily basis that I'm "too small." Which I take as a compliment!|`|v3LnJycKaa	virtually with both my first I was 26 weeks, and 27... this one I am 20 measuring 23 and still not showing yet, but then again i have only gained 1 pound.|`|627pWyVkaa	i know its possible. Ive seen on TLC channel some extreme cases where woman went to hospital in extreme pain and ended up delivering a baby. however these woman were bigger, obese, But they had been losing weight and didnt have the baby bump shape. I think it depends on your body shape and how much weight you may or may not put on. Which i think is why everyone starts showing at different months. My mom said she didnt show until she was around almost 8 months and then she was normal size other woman were (she was really sick with morning sickness through out her entire pregnancy as well) which i think may also play a role.|`|dRd5d6Bgaa	With my daughter, who's now a lil over 15 months old. I didn't show with her until I was about 7 months. When she was born, she was only 6lbs 4oz.|`|9vgZNLP8aa	That would be me. You couldn't tell I was even pregnant till almost 7 months with all three of my children and then I never got that big. This current baby (38.5 weeks) is actually the only baby out my three that is showing a LOT at the end. I feel so huge! :P|`|LoP2CRE2aa	My grandmother had my mother when she was out of wedlock and gave her up for adoption (it was frowned upon at those times)    Her family never knew she was pregnant. No one did for that matter, and she worked until 3 days before she delivered. she never showed enough to not be able to hide it easily.    I have read though that for some people who know they will be giving their babies up for adoption, they internalize their pregnancy. It is a mental thing but can have the physical side effect of not showing much.|`|f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	The lady on the TLC show "I didn't know I was pregnant", didn't show at all.|`|3paE1E9Xaa	I didn't know I was pregnant until I was 20 wks!!! and didn't start showing until I was about 26 wks. pregnant.|`|MQ83HGD5aa	I'm 20 weeks and still not showing. I know everything is ok, just every woman is different.|`|3dxwK9v3aa	I had a friend that told everyone she was pregnant when she was 39 weeks. She was on the larger side so she didn't really look pregnant, she just looked bigger.|`|hSJnaysiaa	I am 32 weeks pregnant and don't really show. I was a bit chubby to begin with though, and have only gained 4 pounds through the entire pregnancy. My pants feel tighter, and if I'm naked I can feel the difference in my stomach, but other people can't tell I'm pregnant.|`|kmQqbxpQaa	A lady in my play group is pregnant (5.5 months) and isn't showing.  She isn't obese either but she isn't skinny.  It really is body type related.  I am 5 feet 1 and weighed 100lbs before I became pregnant and I showed as early as 3 months  - the only way was out b/c I was so petit.|`|5805bf3a9bb2e4808ef2d73593aaab11aa	I am four months along (17 weeks). I am tiny. 5 '4" at 114 lbs. I am not showing at all. Of course they say first time mom's don't really pop until much later on. We'll see. I know I should be glad I've not had to buy a ton of maternity clothes yet, but I'd really love a baby bump. :)
067in9BMaa	38/52 is how far his head is down in the canal. yes baby can move that much. Its just his head down there. The whole rest of his body is free to move. The pains you are feeling is the baby stretching your hips and it sounds like you are having braxton hicks. Nothing to worry about. Won't be too much longer. Congrats!|`|AA10717561	The baby is in the birthing position and yes they can continue to be quite active.I had a ultrasound at 37 weeks and the babies head was so far down in my pelvis they couldnt take head measurements.    You are having braxton hick contractions they are practice for the real thing|`|wHVx9HZVaa	It means 38 weeks pregnant (52 in a year for clarity). Your doctor obviously thinks you are further along than you think you are.  The period pains and bloated feeling are all signs of the head being lower down in the pelvis and that your baby is getting ready to be born. He will still be able to move but it will be slower and you will feel it more just because it is all so close to your pelvis. It can cause your leg to suddenly give out when walking so don't be alarmed it this happens. A hormone called relaxin is making your ligaments loosen up for the birth.  It sounds like you will soon be holding your baby. Good luck:)    EDIT...I think I am wrong. I just went through my old notes and it is to do with the measurements of your stomach.  The first measurement is the distance in cm from the pubic bone to the top of the bump (fundus) the second is the measurement from hip to hip in cm. over the fattest point.  Are those measurements about right for you?|`|ed45267264b8e14db51a0d554e40d2a3aa	If you didn't know what it mean how come you don't ask the doctor if you don't know what it mean?
nuT4GDTEaa	sounds like u could be, but just so u dont get a BFN for testing to early wait til the 13th and test if your cycle does not start... GOOD LUCK :)|`|0Td3MZj2aa	Well when i became pregnant in November i had period like cramps like 2 weeks before my period was due and it never happened to me before.  Sometimes the pain was so bad i would swear it was on but i would go to the bathroom and nothing would be there.  Then it just never came on.  I sometimes felt sick too.  Good luck to you !!!!|`|NNwEuC8paa	Sounds like there is a good chance!  Wait at least 4 days to test, did you have any spotting at all?|`|ostF23Omaa	well I think it's way to soon to tell   1 and 2 you don't get pg symptoms that soon. It's not possible you may be feeling ovulation pain or just cramping from your period. you may be pg it's possible but there's no way you can tell right now.  Good Luck.|`|winmjHAmaa	Most will say it is too early to tell.  I am 5dpo and I felt sick to my stomach this morning.  Mine may be all in my head, lol.  The truth is that you just never know.  Baby dust *~
93b7b24cc4b3ba428911ea6130ff091aaa	i live in Connecticut    and i am sick and stuck at home too.    feel better! =]|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	Aww, I've had those days too.    But I don't live in the states! I'm in Canada, but I'm not really comfortable with saying what province I live in.     I am currently waiting for my next class to begin (I'm in college).    Get better soon!|`|EccBqsntaa	California  And nothing...I'm home too. My dad got mad at me so he refused to drive me to school and it was raining here so I couldn't walk and my mom's car needs a new battery. So she said just stay home.|`|LMRaSXFeaa	i live in minnesota and im supposed to be doing school. :b|`|TffCSzHxaa	I live in Texas. Right now I'm not really doing that much...but I think in a minute I'm going to go read a book. (And if you're wondering what book, it is eclipse)|`|FGZR9RwDaa	omg i'm stuck at home sick too:/  but i went to the doctor and got medicene so i'm okay:)|`|XLsnuAqmaa	i live in pennsylvania and i am sitting at my desk at work pretending that i am working =)    feel better, hon!|`|4FhrvZ3Raa	i live in england :)  i'm just browsing the internet! ahahah    aw, get better soon! :)|`|nB8zqdfJaa	Im in Saskatchewan, Canada, and im just here on the computer researching getting wisdom tooth pulled out...    Feel better soon.|`|H90uflbFaa	pennsylvania & sitting in study hall really bored, here is only like 3 other people in here|`|YDs5mdHTaa	North dakota; Im in school working on a project.    Wear a smile and get friends; wear a scowl and get wrinkles :D|`|AA11946796	Missouri, and I'm sick today.  They can't figure out whats wrong.  Very dizzy, and most of the medicine they have me on makes it worse!  So I'm just sitting here watching some entertaining youtube videos and eating some soup.  I hope you get well soon!
ROJans2Taa	I conceived my son 4 days after my period, and my cycles are pretty regular (28 days). I was ttc and counted that month out because I was sick the rest of the month, and only had sex the first few days after my period. best luck
AA11537248	Wait for the kid at his bus stop.  Then jump out of your soccer-mom suv, and put him in a sleeper hold.      Seriously...    Do nothing.  The kids were just grab-assing.  Boys will be boys.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	If this other kid did as a surprise, I'd contact the school about it. I know kids like to make each other pass out, it's stupid but every generation does it. But if the kid is "surprising" people with it, then that's very dangerous and should be reported.|`|a3MSSvdcaa	I'd just let it go.  Boys rough house alot and sometimes don't know their own strength.  As long as his friend doesn't do it again, he should be ok.|`|627pWyVkaa	i would just go to his parents not through the school as you said it wasnt bullying and it is your childs friends... I would just tell his parents to talk to their son and have him know  he could harm someone and could be charged with assault if he did that to some other child or if a teacher had seen.|`|nrQijvMuaa	As an adult you do what your heart tell you to do especially for both.|`|xXEFvl8Naa	sleeper holds work by reducing blood flow to the brain, definitely not a good idea.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	I agree that it might be overreacting in telling the school. Do you know the boys parents? If you do I would suggest that you talk to them first, explain that you know he was only messing around which is why you have not involved the school but could they please talk to him about the dangers of that particular move. But do be aware they might not listen and try to put the blame on your son. I had this happen when I asked another mum to talk to her daughter about something she was saying that really upset mine and she turned on us in the end we had to involve the school when she pushed my daughter on the stairs, but I do hope your son's friends parents are more willing to listen|`|J9uIISInaa	speak to his parents rather than school.|`|fQ18TyyKaa	How about talking to the offending boys parents? You know it was not on purpose, so why ruin his life? On the other hand, someone needs to know that what he did is dangerous.|`|sJQ6gG0Uaa	you contradict yourself you say because the kid was only messing around and it wasnt bullying making it sound like you want to ring up and say to the teachers to leave it be.    but then you say I know its very wrong but that kid could have his life ruined because of this phone call. He should have thought about what he was going to do before, making it sound liek you want to ruin his life    ....make your mind up?
a12cbnR4aa	Why would you use a tampon if you are not on your period. The brown discharge could be implantation spotting.|`|3sGtibk5aa	Brown blood comes at the start of your Period, i ovulated on the 24th too (had sex on that day) now im 2 days late for my period, which never happens.   You could have implantation bleeding, which is only a small amount of blood (spotting) this happens a couple of days before your period is due.   Good luck :-)  x|`|NNwEuC8paa	It could be implantation but I always get old blood before my period, I've thought I was pregnant many times because of it. That actually just started happening this year but doctors say it's normal! Good luck! Lots of baby dust!!
LXZyqGiyaa	LOL! Your baby's head is huge because his daddy's head was huge.  That's also why his peter is large too (or so I've heard).|`|e0xpYnv1aa	No...everyone I know that have recently had babies constantly downed soda their entire pregnancy and their babies turned out normal. And I drink caffine daily and they say on ultrasounds my baby looks 100% normal.|`|QmIK2vgqaa	Yes.  You are much better off drinking lots of cheap beer and liquor too. That way the baby has huge bug-eyes to match their big head.|`|dRd5d6Bgaa	Nooo...whoever told you that, doesn't know what they're talking about. Actually, you're not suppose to drink a lot of caffiene while you're pregnant b/c it could have sugar problems when born and it could cause other health issues.   You're only suppose to drink equivalent to a can of soda, which is like 3-4 cups of caffienated coffee.|`|AA10186411	No.  I am a caffeine addict so I drank several sodas a day and my daughters head is just fine lol|`|DgXmTJzYaa	CAffiene is bad for the babies developing heart. It will speed up your heart rate as well as its. Think about it. It is smaller than you as well. The more caffiene that goes in your blood stream makes you more alert and your heart rate speed up. The poor little babies heart shouldnt have to try and handle all the caffeine.     Too much caffeine can cause miscarriage, seriously, it happened to my friend. Just be safe they say stick to a serving or less a day. like one pop or one cup of coffee. Why risk it?|`|OrzXoAywaa	nope....i don't think so ...but lots of cafferine during pregnacy is a sure NO NO !!|`|PiejaARKaa	No, but it will make your babies heartbeat go up each time you drink it. Just imagine how you feel when you come off caffeine with the headaches etc, you don't want them to go through that when they come out, so be very careful. Try decaf - GL!|`|ostF23Omaa	I don't know about coffee but with my son I was sick all day literally. So I drank a lot of coke and he is fine and healthy. I heard your not supposed to drink Coffee when your pregnant, but I don't know how true that is.
8t8NjjnVaa	No, they come from the stork that drops them on your doorstep silly!|`|AA11618168	They are left in the cabbage patch by a stork.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Yes, swiss cheese.|`|1oj4aamaaa	The stork.|`|JP2h62qiaa	only Gorgonzola though|`|wKYdIaZVaa	When a man and woman have sex, the man will ejaculate inside the woman. His sperm will travel through the vagina finally reaching the fallopian tubes. There, if the woman is ovulating (hence, releasing an egg) the one lucky sperm will enter the egg and fertilize it.     Then, the egg travels down to the uterus and attaches to the wall of the uterus. The cells will quickly multiply and in no time a baby is formed.     40 or so weeks pass and the baby decides its time to come out. A woman will either have the baby by pushing it out her vagina or a doctor performs a c-section... then...    TA-DA!!!! a BABY!    Hope I helped! :)|`|ed45267264b8e14db51a0d554e40d2a3aa	It's sad that you don't know...|`|RzYePezkaa	go ask your mom or google it no they do not come from cheese.|`|b2dffdde9d95855452a59a5a7564c914aa	Heaven. Plain and simple.|`|VhmBMJKxaa	OMG, are you actually serious? If you are, let me know, and I will answer you.|`|FJdHsYJRaa	they come from your moms hole the one thats pink not the one that stinks!!!!!|`|K5uoaetaaa	No, you can find them under gooseberry bushes, or sometimes the stork brings them.  I got my son free with a packet of washing powder; no cheese involved at all.|`|QK7ssy2Xaa	Uhh... Ok how old are you? I think you better ask your mom or dad. From cheese??? No... if you are serious its when a man and woman have sex.|`|IzHkb1neaa	OMG, ask your parents|`|YcpdP5hkaa	stork|`|SIp415MFaa	OMG are you serious|`|AA11203832	Lol where you born in the moon?? Babies grow in wounds and and finally come out their beautiful mothers|`|It1cgrVwaa	yes. babies come from cheese.|`|3lRX0tHkaa	Umm...no, they don't come from cheese. Ask your parents and they will tell you, by the way, how old ARE you? If you are a certain age, maybe you should wait for a family member to tell you.|`|nAcpOb0saa	in your case you were probibly an *** baby!|`|Sn1cRueAaa	the stork brought me my baby too :) 2 points yayyy!!!|`|2P0Trx4Xaa	i guess this is a joke or??  if not,here is the answer:  It is made out of the sperms from the man and the egg from the woman|`|lYsrCTCwaa	yes they do, so don't eat cheese:)|`|Q03JJEi6aa	Yes, so stay away from "The Cheese"!!...I'm serious!! lol   2 points woo hoo!!
xzh8r0jIaa	IF THE TEST ARNT WORKING, GET THE BLOOD TEST...    OR WAIT TILL YOU MISS THE NEXT LIKE THE DR SAID, AND QUIT WAISTING MONEY ON THE TEST|`|EAzyjftKaa	if you are ttc start taking prenatal vitamins in case you are and yes you can be pregnant and have negative preg test. If you are not stop thinking of that because you are stressing your self out and that can make you skip periods. Good luck.|`|4DoXomHZaa	No one will know unti lyou take the blood test. Find another doc if yours is refusing, which is ridiculous. You would probably have + urine tests by now, so you may have just skipped a period, that happens.|`|dzyJw0cvaa	I doubt you are pregnant.  It is not uncommon to miss periods here and there, even if you have been regular up until now.  Are you super stressed about something? Has your diet changed?  Certain things can lead to missed periods other than pregnancy and those little tests we take are so accurate that it is very likely you are not pregnant.  I wouldnt worry about it so much anymore, just be more careful having sex in the future so this kind of stuff doesnt happen.  Even though being on Birth Control, i STILL worry sometimes!! but thats normal.  unplanned pregnancies are just about the most UN FUN experience a woman can have...GOOD LUCK!|`|AA10153923	Get another doctor, you have the right to know.|`|IA5zVfk0aa	i would get an ultrasound :) thats how i did it becuase i kepts getting negatives.. ultrasounds will definately tell you if theres something growing in there.|`|ygbDZPJHaa	well hun i advice you to take the blood test that's the best thing         *princess*|`|90zcKChJaa	I know it's frustrating, but you just have to be patient. If you tested after your missed period and got a negative, then I would take that. I would suggest testing again after the 7th to see if you get a different answer.|`|ODruvqfOaa	You just asked this
sAhAEC2qaa	google it. my friend had a minnie mouse themed shower b/c she was having a girl. we got plastic mouse ears at walmart and the mom to be wore them. there was a minnie mouse cake we found the recipe  on the internet as well as ordered minnie mouse shaped candy trays and we made chocolates shaped like her too. the table cloths were pink and red but for mickey it could be red and black. also kmart has mickey themed items like blankets and bottles and clothes and binkis and all kinda of things, so maybe register there. huggies snug n dry diapers have mickey and pluto on them so maybe some1 could make a diaper cake out of that kind. on the internet you can find all kinds of things for mickey themed bday parties and you can order them and tailor them to fit a baby shower. another idea is to make black and red and white frosted cupcakes and use oreo halves for ears on top. i got a personal sized pink and white cake for the mom to be and put oreo cakester halves on it for ears and since it was a little bigger then a cupcake, i made minnie's face on it. if some1 has the time, they can put mickey stickers on the table clothes. bday party sites have mickey plates and napkins and cups if you wanna go that far w/ things. i hope i have helped you. i will find a few good sites and edit them in in a minute|`|d0ddKfnCaa	You can get baby shower centerpieces at www.SamaKiTush.com.  They have pictures on there but you can order a creation to your theme.|`|AA10742362	u could use the colors for ur settings      like red tablecloth, black napkins, white plates and yellow utensils or combo of.  u can get mickey plates, etc off of    www.orientaltrading.com for centerpiece see if u can get those ear hats and cut whole in center for flowers or balloon to come out of  just thinking quick...    http://www.tcwdesigns.com/mickeymouseand...
nYnlYAE1aa	I would say in the summer months.    I am in the same situation. My bday is 2/23 and my bdays are always lame. My sis was born on the 4th of July and her birthdays are always full of fun.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	may!!! i dont know i guess anytime when kids are at school. my sisters birthday is in july and she hates it because she isnt at school and doesnt get to celebrate in class like the other kids.|`|51ne4RkHaa	Between June and july|`|6IEpZkAcaa	in the middle of summer!!!!   =D|`|n0WnEIopaa	I think it is fun no matter what month, you just have to make the BEST of it!     In the winter months some fun things to do;    Ice skating parties, with hot chocolate and marshmallow warmups!     You could take the kids to a dance studio arrange a dance class, have the kids preform the dance they learned for the parents at pick up time!     Art class all the kids could go to an art studio, make something out of pottery or clay to bring home.      You could take the kids sledding, and again have tons of hot chocolate to warm up with.     Go karting! If the kids are old enough.     Those are just a few things!     A party is as fun as you make it. You could have a lame party in June and a super party in Jan!|`|AA12062311	My mom always told me to try to plan the birth of my kids for June and July, but this is not for birthday parties more for better for the parents. One you aren't late stage pregnant and getting heat flashes during the hottest month of the year, and second your kid gets clothes and things every 6 months so its a lot cheaper for you because of christmas and the birthday.|`|nrQijvMuaa	My son's birthday is in August as well & my daughters is in June I Love both of the months. Weather is perfect for many out door party's! Example: Went to schlitterbaun that water park is awesome. ...etc..
ZbJ0bx3Uaa	I convinced myself I was having a girl, but I had repeated dreams of having a boy.     The ultrasounds all said it was a boy... we'll verify that in 5 days or less.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Mine was wrong me and everybody close to me had really strong feelings I was having a girl and we were all sure of it and its a boy. Not saying your feeling is wrong but mine was.|`|ykP7I3caaa	It has to do with the sperm so looking at your boyfriends family would be a good indication! Chromosome wise, you as a female are xx and he as a male is xy so since you only have an x to offer it's a 50/50 chance on which gene your boyfriend gives. I won't believe the ultrasound tech if they tell me it's a girl.. I'll still be suspicious.. Two weeks now! I'll let you know then.|`|C55pji5Qaa	Yes,I thought we were having two boys.I was certain their would be at least one. But multiple ultrasounds show two girls!!!|`|6e541cf93eb873a02de583d69ccab728aa	I had a dream before I was even pregnant, of  a little grl with brown hair that looked a lot like me....and when we decided to get pregnant we thought of a girl name ...I just had a feeling deep inside me I was having a girl... well on the day of my ultrasound some0ne asked me if I was excited to find out the gender and I said'' yes, but I already can feel that I'm having a little grl'' and an hour later I found out I was! and we named her the name we thought of too=)|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I knew my first was a boy and I knew my second was a girl and was correct both times.|`|90zcKChJaa	I swore that my first was a boy. I had convinced myself, and sure enough we had a girl! So, yeah, I was as far off as you can get. lol. I'm trying my luck again and saying I am pregnant with a boy again! we shall see!|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	Yes my intuition was right.  All of my sisters have boys and for some reason I felt like I was having a girl.  All the gender quizzes and chinese calendars said I was having a boy but for some reason I thought I was having a girl.  We found out yesterday and it was a girl!|`|0uhRgfcsaa	mine was correct. a little girl :)|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I knew with both of my children.  I wanted a girl so bad with my first but I knew it was a boy.  I decided not to find out the gender because I did not want to be one of those women who gets upset when they find out the gender isn't the one they preferred.  When he was born and the doctor screamed "it's a boy!"  I was so happy to see him that gender went out the window.  With my second I knew it was a girl and convinced my doctor to take a peek at 16 weeks with his ultrasound.  (it was in his office) he said it was too soon but he would check just in case.  She was definitely a girl!  They are now 7 & 9 and if I am blessed with another one I have no preference on gender :)|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	I was so sure I spent crazy money on boy themed things the week before my ultrasound. Sure enough I have a girl now! Couldn't have been more wrong and couldn't be happier about it!|`|3TTvqfbZaa	being right you will have a boy|`|3qI1oyFaaa	wrong wrong wrong.    thought it was a girl.     DEFINITELY a boy :)|`|k1icqPDGaa	well my friend and I both are sure shes having a boy, she went to her 20 week scan yesterday and they said 90% sure its a boy.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	I knew I was having a girl, I just felt it. My husband kept saying "no, there's no girls anywhere in my family unless they married into the family, no girls have ever been born blah blah..."    Turns out I was right :)
aJjV5b95aa	If he is having health problems and is not able to go to school and you think that it might not change anytime soon then I say you should home school him, especially since you have experience in home schooling. That way you are not stressed with the school calling and giving you a hard time. Also see what he thinks about it and let him know what you plan on doing.|`|AA10424307	I respectfully disagree with the previous response-- a quick decision to home school your boy will not address whatever problem he has with going to school! If he is a "straight-A student" you also risk his grades worsening simply from interrupting his course with that change.  Instead, why not explore with him and the teacher the basis of his "problems" going to school? (I was an "A" student who hated going to school in the early years, cried alot, got sick on test days, etc! I was just a shy child and somewhat neurotic, and put lots of pressure on myself. This could be a "difficult phase" which will resolve over time.)    If he's missing school due to his health, have you helped him to keep up by obtaining school work for him to do at home? Does he feel pressured to keep up despite his absences? Is the school informed of his health problem (and if so they should work with you, and not "give you a hard time!" Providing documentation, notes from parents/doctor, are important for his records as well as a courtesy to his teacher.)  Don't be so quick to give in the school's pressure.  Request a private meeting with his teacher and/or counselor, with your son present. Let him describe how he feels and let the teacher make a suggestion; let teacher see your parental involvement and concern.  County/City  school systems are vastly different around the country. If all else fails, check with the counseling office to explore more options.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	I think they should back off. I'm all for homeschooling.|`|i7oGjwJBaa	does your state have cyber schools?  here in PA we have a few cybers to pick from - they are accredited public schools (therefor free to you) - all the same as public school work except you do it from home.  one of the benefits they tout is it's great for children with medical problems as often they can do the work from home, even though they wouldn't have been well enough to go to school.
a12cbnR4aa	Friday the 13th for me. I haven't decided if I should test then or not.:{|`|WdvLcYaVaa	My period is due on V day and my and my hubby's anniversary is on the 17th, so I am really hoping this is my month so I can tell him on our anniversary. This is only our second month trying though. With our first, we didn't really try, it just happened, so I have no idea what to expect this time around! Good luck to you I hope we both get our BFP's!!!|`|Fq3Ojjf3aa	*Raising hand*    Im testing on vday. My breasts are majorly swollen and sore. And i have dizzy spells.  We should keep each other posted!    Ive been trying with fiance for 2 years. :-/|`|zdlLVB1Kaa	I'll be testing the Monday afterwards which happens to be President's Day and I am off from work.  Being my hubby works from home, it would be awesome to find out that we are pregnant and not have to go to work.  Valentine's Day would definitely be a romantic day to tell your husband so good luck.  Are you having any symptoms that might make you think you are pregnant this month?|`|dRd5d6Bgaa	I'm not taking a test on Valentines Day, but I'm taking one either the 11th or 12th and praying for a miracle. If I find that I am pregnant, I will tell him Valentines Day.|`|39c2446b919f263832a80ca402b9f06eaa	Yes, I plan to test on Valentine's Day... if I can wait that long. I am thinking of testing on the day before since I saw an adorable Valentine's card for a daddy-to-be that I would love to give to my husband this year. We have been trying for several YEARS now. It would be the most amazing gift and the best symbol of our love. |`|qH1YcQ2kaa	i probably wouldnt be able to tell yet. :(  that would be a nice valentine's day gift though.  my husband and i actually met on valentine's day, so that would be really cool if i could get a positive that day.|`|n6OemdySaa	I am testing on V day! :) hehe. I hope we all get bfp!! :)    Good luck to us all! We deserve it!!  ttc for 10 months!|`|winmjHAmaa	I am hoping and praying this is THE month!  My AF is due the day after.  I really don't care what day I get my BFP as long as I get it this month!  I am so tired of waiting!!!  I am only 5dpo now so I haven't had any symptoms yet.  But I want them!  Baby dust*~|`|wfZBsnPdaa	well i would love to but it may be to early for me :{ i am due for AF on 2/21 but I ovulate very early around 7-11 days after cd 1 and I bd like crazy LOL so I am hoping I can get an accurate test at 11-12 dpo....good luck to you and send some my way :}|`|d0h6urtRaa	AF is due on feb 8 but I'm waiting to test until valentine's day, I think it will be a great suprise! good luck and lots of baby dust to you!
LeY6hx4Laa	do you know why she wouldn't want you to have this baby? i understand that you would want to give up, maybe try writing her a letter and tell her how you feel or go and see her, it would be a shame for her to miss out on her granchild, but if that doesnt work its then up to her you have done all you can do, good luck|`|HMhUKAgkaa	She will eventually get over it if she wants to see her grandchild. She can't hold it against you forever.|`|AA10186411	I had the same problem, only with my dad.  After a few months he was bearable to be around, but still angry with me.  But now if you ask him about it, he loves my daughter so much, and he has apologized so many times for asking me to have an abortion, and says he is so glad I had her!  She is just disappointed, but when that precious baby is born she will be glad!|`|s15isztsaa	When the baby comes into the world everything will change.  Your mom is disappointed right now but when she sees that beautiful baby and holds him or her your moms heart will meant.  That little baby might have been an ooopss but your mom will get to the point where she can't imagine her world without her grandchild:)|`|sEihaeLNaa	dont even bother. She will give you a call when she is ready. To push it. Moms usually tend to get all bent out of shape when we get preggo. She will get over it.
oHNrktxTaa	You need to ovulate in order to become pregnant. Your egg needs to be released & become fertilized.    Your OBGYN should be able to give you medication to help you to ovulate. There are ways to help ovulation. I am surprised that he did not explain all your alternatives with you. I would look into this further. There is so much that they can do today.     Keep your head up & think positive thoughts.     Best of luck!|`|a12cbnR4aa	well if you don't ovulate then your ovaries do not release an egg to become fertilized.|`|z6BtwSE8aa	No egg=no baby, so no, you can't get pregnant if you don't ovulate.|`|ApHLa19Faa	Depending on the reason you aren't ovulating (I don't know what a septum is), there ARE drugs you can take to make you ovulate. The most common is Clomid. You should talk to your doctor about your options.
3J61iXGDaa	Rylee is a cute name. Pretty much all of them are cute. My favorite name is Lyra. I don't know It's just sounds pretty to me.|`|mRQxlNH5aa	I agree that Rylee is pretty, I really like it. Why don't you try Camryn Rylee? or Rylee Devon? two middle names can be tough.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I love Rylee Brooke or Rylee Skye.  They are both pretty.  I am sorry but I am not a fan of 2 middle names.  I think it sounds akward.  Good luck hun|`|Vw9dvel1aa	I love Rylee and Skye not so much the Brooke.   Alaina Skye is pretty....   Rylee Devyn  Camryn Rose  Camryn Brooke  Rylee Brooke   I think 2 names is good unless there is a family importance to it then use three|`|nkM6wmv6aa	I don't like your way of spelling stuff|`|P9zJmmcMaa	Reilly is fine if you don't make up the spelling.  Brooke is also fine, but Skye is too much (and not just for length).  And really, who uses their middle name often?|`|h57t7FAjaa	I don't think it's too long at all.  All three names are cute and short, so it works!    I also like the other names you mentioned, they're all nice :)    Some other suggestions:  Devon Rylee  Devon Brooke  Camryn Skye    hope this helps, good luck!|`|FvYqKZSMaa	That is a nice name and no its not to long.Rylee and skye are some of my favrote names and brooke flows well with it.|`|KYyP8Dtraa	I really like it! It's very pretty and chic sounding.    I am not a fan of Camyrn or Devon for a girl. I think those are too boyish for me.  sorry.      Girl's names:  Dakota  Elle  Mayden  Kate  Sophia  Anna|`|INAiAOD6aa	i like Rylee  my favorite girl name would be Lilly=]]  good luck!|`|3paE1E9Xaa	Rylee Brooke Skye is a beautiful name and NO its not to long and besides you know girls love having pretty names and I know your baby girl will be proud when she says her name!!!|`|2LTumLwNaa	Those are adorable named! My favorites are Rylee, Camryn, and Skye :)    Possibilities:  Rylee Gabrielle  Camryn Adrianna  Skye Anne (or maybe as a first name, SkyeAnne)|`|05f0422d6b7494f2a7dcefa19ad4600caa	They are all too trendy for my taste|`|sM9JQBG0aa	Rylee brooke skye is very cute but might be a little long.   i think the Rylee brooke is really cute tho. it all really depends on the last name. i think Camryn and devon are also very cute(most girls i know spell it devynn or devinne,still prononced th same, it seems more girly)   maybe you could try something like camryn skye or even devon rylee.   rylee brooke would have to be my fave but if you want to do brookly sky i think that would be very cute too-->> the you could use the nickname brooke. even camryn brooke sounds cute.   well best of luck!|`|AHRLXm1maa	Absolutely nothing wrong with being unique but more than one unique name is too much I think. I think when you put the the three names together it looks like your trying really hard to be unique and modern. I would leave it as Rylee Brooke, or Rylee Skye..Rylee Brooke would be my favorite though.|`|x8TtsCdbaa	i like that named rylee brooke skye but in my opinion i thin that  it is too long....and then if you take out brooke then whats left is a rhyme rylee skye...
N83Po9PZaa	I'm sorry, but being a mother of five kids myself, don't you know the routine by now?    If he does anything different, then ask him a question. Trust yourself to know how this song and dance goes, even if you have a rougher time of it than other mothers. Apparently your uterus does just fine growing babies, and you probably know when something's wrong better than any doctor would. Maybe you'll get lucky and this new doctor will be a dream come true, better than your old one.     But if he sucks big time, go find a third. You should have an opinion by now on good care vs. bad.
zwJbUbWMaa	It is different for everyone.  It just depends on how andvanced your PCOS is.  Have you had an ultrasound to see how many cysts or cyst particles you have forming around your ovaries?  I caught it when there were very few and by taking Metformin I had no trouble at all getting pregnant.  For many on the other hand it is nearly impossible to get pregnant.|`|AA10186411	If you aren't trying to get pregnant, don't rely on PCOS to save you.  Remember, most people get pregnant when they AREN'T trying.|`|ApHLa19Faa	It depends on how often you ovulate. Do you temp or chart your cycles to see if you are ovulating? My best friend has had severe PCOS her entire life and never has periods on her own. Therefore she does not ovulate. However with the aid of fertility drugs, she was able to conceive a healthy set of twins.    Other women with PCOS ovulate regularly, others occasionally, but as long as you are ovulating, you can get pregnant without medical intervention. The best thing to do is chart your cycles to see whether you are ovulating. Good luck!
eO4y3m1maa	Girls who feel lonely, think the guy will be there..or the kid will be their new best friend...confused with the natural instincts but not thinking about the reality of it.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	a lot of it is peer pressure. they figure their friends are doing it then why should,nt they. plus TV and on the computer they see stuff.|`|FEzmVmFjaa	I think that now days there is alot more pressure to have sex, atleast where I live. It does seem like some guys wont stay with you unless you have sex with them, as shallow and sh*tty as it is, but it's reality. Teenage guys are horny as hell!  And I think the reason the girls get pregnant is because they don't take pregnancy seriously, thinking it could never happen to them, or thinkin pullout works, and other things.   Also, in the town where I grew up there was NOTHING to do, so starting very young, everyone was partying and drinking, resulting in ALOT of girls in my middle school and high school getting pregnant.|`|mRQxlNH5aa	Juno and Knocked Up glamorized the unwed mother lifestyle and plenty of girls think they can handle it, that they can finally have someone who loves them unconditionally. I'm also doing a project on this and I've found that many of these girls don't intend on becoming pregnant but once they are they think it'll help make their boyfriend stay, that their significant other will love them more.|`|ROJans2Taa	hormones raging, you get the urge to have sex and nothing else is on your mind, condom or not, you just go with the urges. most teens dont have a real sense of consequence yet, I got pregnant at 16, nobodys fault but my own.|`|dzyJw0cvaa	Some people on here are so shallow minded...there are tons of teenagers out there that actually TRY to have babies.  Its not always a stupid mistake!!  I think they do it because it goes along the line of depression.  its a cry for attention.  they want someone to love, somene to take care of, someone to call their own.  I think sometimes it does have to do with their bf at the time and not wanting him to leave them so it has to do sometimes with seperation anxiety.      But most of the time its by accident.  its because they just havent learned enough about their own bodies and sex.  (As in my case.)  And feeling pressured has A LOT to do with it, especially with girls that are into relationships with older guys.  They trust the guy, they love the guy and they believe him when he promises nothing bad will happen.  (Also in my case.)    Some girls feel the pull of parenting too soon.  They want to be a mother and they have good intentions as a teenager, but they just want a baby so bad that they cant stop the instincts to have a baby.    There are lot of reasons.  I dont have any sources i guess besides myself as a teen mom at one point.  But i hope this helps!|`|PFO1jxZGaa	everyone else is having sex, the boy says he loves her and if she loved him she would do it, not knowing or caring about birthcontrol, seeing it being all over tv and movies etc.   It's been proven that teenagers brains are not yet developped enough to fully process the consequences of their actions, not just with sex but in other situations too  As for actually wanting to have a baby, not just getting knocked up I think some girls are lonely and feel unloved by their parents and think they will have this perfect little baby who will love them uncoditionally, or they  might think that the boy they are with will be with them now forever because they have a baby. And many of them think that they actually are grown up enough at 15 or 16 to take on a responsibility of raising a child.  Also they dont realize what goes into caring for a baby, they see a cute baby at the mall laughing and think thats all its going to be, going to places with a happy baby and buying cute baby clothes. No one told them about the sleepless nights and poop up to the babys neck, toddlers throwing fits and running to the er in the middle of the night + all the money it takes to raise a kid|`|AA10409800	Internal reasons?  Well, that would basically be the sperm that was deposited inside their vagina.  Didn't you learn this in school?|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	Its teenagers being stupid & having sex with or without protection & not thinking about the consequences.
dzyJw0cvaa	your baby is going to be just fine.  think of all the moms out there that DONT take prenatal vitamins and end up with healthy happy babies anyway!!  It sounds like the pills remained in your tummy which means the nutrients would be absorbed for your little one.  Even if you had lost the pills, your baby would be ok without a dose here and there.  Dont worry.  youre doing a great job and your baby will be ok! Even if nature has other plans for you!|`|JAixzzctaa	I believe your baby will be fine.  The prenatal vitamins are a supplement more for you than for your baby who takes his/her nutrients from you with or without those vitamins.  Besides the prenatal vitamins are more just to supplement the food that you eat to make sure that you do get enough of the vitamins that your body needs as well.  Just eat healthy and try to eat nutrient rich foods so that you get plenty of the vitamins you need.  Don't worry so much about your baby, he's getting everything he needs from you!|`|AA10976951	I worried about the same thing but during the first trimester my doctor said the pills are bigger than the baby anyway and that a lot of women didn't take them and that was okay, but that if I was really concerned I could take Flintstones since they are chewable and would get into my system faster.|`|8WRnqs08aa	With my first three children, I was so sick, I couldn't even swallow a prenatl vitamin. I ate healthy & had to get all of my nutrients from the foods I ate - all three are healthy as can be.    With my current pregnancy & my last (2008) I have been able to take my prenatals, iron sup., and folic acid sup., without incident.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	a lot of women have a problem w/ this, some women even get sick from prenatal vitamins during their first month of taking them. ur baby might not get all the vitamins if u puke within 15mins after taking them bc it takes a little while for it to dissolve in ur system, try taking them before u go to bed from now on.|`|frvbZ6auaa	The baby should be fine. I wasn't able to take my prenatals at all with this pregnancy, and my baby has still been growing ok and looking good on the ultrasounds. My prenatals made me sick no matter when I took them or how I took them. My dr just had me eat nutrient rich foods to make up for what I was missing, and I took a folic acid supplement. I would say as long as it's just this one time you are fine, but it if starts happening everyday then maybe choose a different time to take them so you are not puking them right back up after taking them. You don't have to take them in the morning, so if you keep getting sick, try taking them at night and see how that works.
FLOjzbKEaa	yes, retest if still negative go see a doctor as soon as you can for blood test.  Why you waited so long though...|`|7uqOSZNKaa	yeah certainly retest. u missed ur period, spotting doesnt count x the faintest positive is still positive, im guessing ur pregnant|`|QnSKaBcjaa	yes retest
5e4e7e69ebfb2ce16276f743ee45219eaa	Infant carrier style seats have a weight limit of 20-22lbs (though one on the market goes to 30 lbs).  Most rear facing convertible seats have a minimum weight limit of 5 lbs.  So really, as long as your child is between 5 and about 20 lbs you can move to a rear facing convertible seat.  Legally (in the US), your child must remain rear facing until they have reached BOTH 12 months of age AND 20 lbs (though 1 state is 22 lbs, so check your state laws).  However, safety-wise, your child should remain in their rear facing convertible seat to the seat's rear facing weight limit, which is 30-35 lbs depending on model.    From: http://www.carseat.org/  Why is facing rearward so important?    Babies have heavy heads and fragile necks. The neck bones are soft, and the ligaments are stretchy. If the baby is facing forward in a frontal crash (the most common and most severe type of crash), the body is held back by the straps, but the head is not. The head is thrust forward, stretching the neck. Older children and adults wearing safety belts may end up with temporary neck injuries. But a baby's neck bones are soft and actually separate during a crash, and the spinal cord can tear. It's like yanking an electrical plug out of a socket by the cord and breaking the wires.    In contrast, when a baby rides facing rearward, the whole body--head, neck, and torso--is cradled by the back of the safety seat in a frontal crash. Facing rearward also protects the baby better in other types of crashes, particularly side impacts.|`|dRd5d6Bgaa	Legally, you can move them from rear facing to front facing when they are exactly 12 months old and 20 lbs. Most carseats will tell you that on the box when you're moving up from an infant carseat to a "toddler" carseat.|`|d463c686f5093f6cd2cd7e58248297a4aa	You need to switch your baby out of the infant car seats when their feet get to the end of the seat, but that doesn't mean that they can be facing forward. If their not 20 or so pounds (check with your local Highway Patrol) you still need to have a rear facing toddler car seat.|`|61eadcf38f72b14203ed398198796d52aa	You have to switch a baby out of a rear facing infant seat when they hit the weight or height limit on the seat (most infant seats are 22 lbs/29 inches) or when their head is within 1" of the top of the seat.  But they can't go front facing until at least 20 lbs and 1 year old so if your baby hits the limit on their infant seat before they reach those markers, you need to switch them to a convertible car seat.  In a convertible seat, they can ride rear facing until they hit the height/weight limits for the rear facing portion of the seat, which generally translates to somewhere in the third year of life.|`|wKYdIaZVaa	The longer the better... however its recommended that you wait until the baby is 20lbs AND 1 year old|`|Z7V7AbBQaa	My son is 15 months old and 22-23lbs and is still rear facing. I live In Ontario Canada so by our law he could go forward facing once he reached 20lbs but since rear facing is safer he well rear face till 35 lbs the limit on his seat.   In the US a child must be 1 year and 20 - 22 lbs. My best friend lives in the US and we discuss we the baby raising stuff.|`|l7RJkc3baa	its not age, it's weight. they need to  be over 22 lbs|`|NwTggQ2Baa	when they turn 1 or maybe a little older, it depends on how much they weigh. take your baby to the doctor for a check up to see how much he/she weighs and ask the doctor what he/she thinks|`|1SGl03Zlaa	They must be 20 pounds AND 1 year old to be switched to forward facing.  But you don't have to switch them until they exceed the rear-facing weight limit.  Many convertable car seats now have higher weight limits for rear facing because it is much safer for a baby to be rear facing for as long as possible.|`|1S7uXsInaa	The soonest is 1yr + >20lbs.|`|CTMFTU9saa	From what I have heard it is age 1 AND 20 pounds.  But even if they turn one and are NOT 20 pounds yet you shouldn't face them forward.  You should also look it up by the state you live in.|`|diEZW57caa	They have to be at least a year and more then 20 pounds, although they can stay rear facing until they are about 30-35 pounds, check your car seat owners manual.    The only time you will run into trouble is if your child isn't a year yet, but they are over 30 pounds, that's what happened to me.  My daughter was 32 pounds when she was 11 months old (I know, she's a chunky little monkey).|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	1 year and 20lbs both.     I just had to buy a new carseat because my little guy is 25lbs but he is only 8months so it still has to be rear facing.     I hate it because He still falls asleep during car rides and I have to wake him up to get him in and out of the car.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Age 1 and 22 pounds, but research shows it is much safer, and children have a better chance of surviving a car accident in a rear facing car seat!  You should keep them in one as long as you can, I know that's what I plan on doing!|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	They say 1 year and 20lbs.  But they say the longer they are under the weight and height maximums the better it is to keep them rear facing, even if they are over a year old.|`|vue9NOhYaa	You CAN move them into a forward facing seat when they are both 12 months+ AND 20 pounds more more. (With minor variations from state to state -- check for your local regulations.)    But you don't HAVE to turn them at any point.  If baby still fits rearfacing (in either an infant seat or convertable one) then that's the safest position.|`|AA10186411	Age doesn't matter when it comes to car seats.  Its all about weight.  Look at the manufacturers guidelines.  It should tell you the weight limit for rear facing.  The general rule is do NOT turn them around until they are 1 year old AND 20 lbs.  But you do not have to turn them around really until they meet the weight limits on the seat.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	my almost 14 month old is barely 19 pounds and still fits in her infant seat. soon im gonna switch her to her rear facing convertible seat, which she will ride rear facing in until 35 pounds|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	I moved my son from his infant car seat to a convertible car seat at almost 8 months. He had hit the height limit of the seat. He is now 14 months, 23lbs, and walking but I still keep him rear facing because it is safer. Manitoba laws regarding child seats http://www.mpi.mb.ca/english/rd_safety/o...|`|JP2h62qiaa	I think it is 1 year old and 20 pounds.  IF they still aren't 20 pounds at a year old they still have to be rear facing, but no forward facing until after a year.|`|zwJbUbWMaa	It isn't so much the age as it is the weight.    When should a child switch from rear-facing to forward-facing?    Too Tall: If head is within one inch of the top of the child safety seat.     Too Heavy: If child is 30 or 35 pounds--it depends on which seat you have.       NOTE: It is OK for the childs feet to touch the vehicle seat. This is SAFE and is NOT uncomfortable.
Mzvp1LPFaa	My whole family is like that!  You go to one of our family reunions, and everybody age 15 and up has noticeable amounts of snow on the roof. We actually wear our ages very well and the women live into their 90s with clear heads and fit bodies.  It doesn't mean he is  aging prematurely.  It's just a physical trait that runs in some families.  If his hair is light colored he can probably get about 50% gray before it really shows.  If he's a brunette or dark redhead it will stand out sooner.  If it's a matter of  concern you can ask his doctor about temporary color rinses to cover it.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	its just one of those things that happen, ive seen alot or people who have a white spot in their hair,my daughter was born with about 4 white hairs and if the light is right you can still see them in her almost black hair,if your dr says dont worry, dont worry, its only cosmetic.|`|IP2suWFTaa	My son is also 6 yrs old and once in a great while,I'll find a white hair or two in his head.Dr. told me the same thing and its nothing to worry about as long as your son is healthy.|`|MQ83HGD5aa	As long as he is healthy and the doctor doesn't think anything is wrong then stop worrying about it. Is it happening in one spot? If it is then it could be where a birth mark is on his scalp.|`|ostF23Omaa	I know their are some ppl that just get white hair early but 18 is the soonest I've ever heard. Nothing was wrong with them there hair just turned soon.  Good Luck.|`|e0urnErUaa	check with another doc
eO4y3m1maa	Sounds like he really doesnt want to get you pregnant since  he wants to use a condom.......|`|vue9NOhYaa	Because you've been lucky.  Because there's just a lot LESS of it, (and it's not released with such force) so fewer sperm make it into the cervical mucus and your fallopian tubes.    Withdrawal IS better than nothing, but since we don't live in a society where 'better than nothing' is our only option, why not use a method that's more reliable.  Your luck WILL run out eventually.|`|AA10186411	You are just lucky.  You better start using protection because your luck will start running out!|`|nCKdkYSyaa	You weren't having sex on your ovulation days im guessing|`|dzyJw0cvaa	You probably arent as fertile as some women are or you are just really damn lucky.      or he has a low sperm count, or you are sterile, or he is sterile.  There are a million reasons.    But one drop of pre *** is enough to get you pregnant and you should be careful if you dont want to be pregnant.  Its like gamblig with your future and thats not such a good idea.|`|kQC4HX6vaa	You can play the Russian-roulette game, and never get shot until you least expect it.  You've been putting yourself at risk each and every time.  If you keep testing your luck, it's likely that it will eventually run out.    All you need is one sperm to meet your little egg...precum has over 1 million spermatozoa in it.  That's a pretty high risk you're taking.  (Regular amount: 30 million)|`|W1p6LetFaa	Even for couples who are TRYING to get pregnant, there is only about a 20% chance of pregnancy in any given month.  It's actually a lot harder to get pregnant than people think, but, let me say that those who are NOT trying to get pregnant usually get pregnant and those who want to get pregnant have a harder time (go figure).  I went off of birth control for ONE month and used the pull-out "method" instead and got pregnant immediately.  Yes, c*m contains A LOT more sperm but prec*m STILL contains sperm, and it only takes ONE sperm to get pregnant.|`|GjuRYsITaa	maybe you just been lucky|`|ldcs7OdXaa	You can get pregnant by either; precum doesn't have as many sperms in it so I don't think the chances are as high, but I'm 17 and I got pregnant with my son because we tried the whole pull out method (doesn't work) because of the precum.|`|WSbfkuSZaa	Just lucky I guess|`|FgAPXhVRaa	First off, if you are trying to get pregnant just let him c*m in you and then you will really know if you are having trouble. Precum can get you pregnant, one of my friend's little boy is the product of precum. Anyway, go to the doctor and make sure that you don't have any hormonal imbalances or anything that is keeping you from ovulating. My only question is... why are you only using precum and not letting him c*m in you? Does he know that you want  a baby or are trying to get pregnant?|`|WPI0Z47saa	There is only a small window of opportunity each moth to get pregnant anyway. Even when conditions are perfect and you have sex when you are ovulating, the pregnancy only has a 20% chance of taking and producing a baby.|`|kH56qw2Taa	just really lucky xx|`|LoP2CRE2aa	Well it could be anything.     Not all precum contains sperm, but there is always a chance.  Maybe you are infertile (not to scare you, just listing all posiibilities)  Maybe your BF is sterile  Maybe you are extremely lucky (assuming you aren't trying to conceive, but who would use precum to do that?)|`|8YltlMsjaa	you may have just been lucky.. I guess.. Everyone is different though|`|K542Db29aa	maybe its not your time yet :)    when i was 16 thats what got me pregnant lol
GSOYYSUGaa	If you are sure he is shooting blanks than no. I would make sure he can't have kids period though. The only way he would know that is if he had a vasectomy or he had a doctor test him saying he had fertility problems. Some guys will just say that to get out of using a condom I would ask to see paper work if I were you.|`|AA10186411	Read what you just read.  If he can't have kids, then NO!  But how does he know this?  Low sperm count?  Then yes, you can still get pregnant.  Only if he is COMPLETELY sterile can he not get you pregnant, and if he is young, then he has no idea if he is sterile or not.|`|kQC4HX6vaa	How do you know he can't have kids?    Did "he" tell you?  That's a load of bull.    You need to be responsible and not just take someone's word for it.  Protect yourself ALWAYS.|`|QnSKaBcjaa	i wouldnt risk it|`|RzYePezkaa	No because he can't have kids no sperm no swimmers no you definitely can not get pregnant you can however get an STD unless you have been tested together.
ldcs7OdXaa	It has nothing to do with you not wanting to do it obviously. It could be that you are pregnant & you have the belly so you are insecure about it? But when you are pregnant things aren't the same as they were before you were pregnant. Its a hard thing to explain.|`|ROJans2Taa	maybe try role playing, it's hard to feel sexy when you have a baby moving inside you, pretend for that moment your somebody else. it can be fun if your husbands willing. dont be afraid to try new things. good luck
YFPMcHCbaa	I'm really getting tired of seeing this type of question on here. None of the people on here will be able to tell you if you're pregnant. All the symptoms you get during pregnancy can also be associated with something else.    Take a test, or do some research. There are so many different places to get great information on the web.    babycenter.com  pregnancy.org  pregnancy.com  americanpregnancy.org  webmd.com/baby  pregnancy360.com  fitpregnancy.com  surebaby.com  pregnancytoday.com  pregnancy-calendars.org|`|AA10186411	You sound pregnant.  You don't have to throw up to be pregnant.  I didn't throw up with my daughter.  You need to take a test.|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	Sounds like you can be pregnant.  Take a home pregnancy test or go to the doctor and get a blood test done.  Good luck!|`|5X6C4s7zaa	Definitely take a pregnancy test....not every woman has symptoms especially this early. Baby Dust!!|`|EzbJsE5eaa	To be honest, my periods would come and go as they pleased, being really irregular. My best signal to myself was when my body starting changing. With the period calculator, that's basing it off a 28 day cycle. If you are irregular, you can't rely on that. I know that from experience. Everyone has different pregnancy symptoms. So, what I can suggest is that you take a home pregnancy test. If you get a negative result, are still having odd feelings, and haven't had your period, I would see about getting a blood test from your doctor or a local planned parenting. Good luck!|`|FgAPXhVRaa	If you have had sex since your last period I would take a test. I did not have any symptoms early early on. When I did  start having symptoms it was sore back and then my boobs got sore. Then the exhaustion came on, but that happened at about 7 or 8 weeks... :) Anyway good luck!!|`|8f6fff32b0caffa89ef6b762f487ae26aa	By now, you should take a pregnancy test..the walgreens brand is accurate..it should show right now..sometimes symptoms show later after a couple of months..If you had sex between Jan 2 and Jan 9th.you could be pregnant..Check out the chart below..its very accurate..|`|3sGtibk5aa	Pregnancy test sweetie  x|`|WSbfkuSZaa	I would take a test. I only threw up once during my first trimester and didn't get any heavy symptoms until like 8 weeks or so.|`|N83Po9PZaa	Can you remember if you had sex between the 7th and the 14th of Jan? Given your dates, you were ovulating sometime during those days. Good luck!|`|5nAWhEKRaa	I conceived my baby in Oct a week before I was going to start my pried. Well of cores I did have my pried and it was all normal so I had know I idea I was pregnant until I was 6 week pregnant so about the 2 of Dec. So it could be possible your pregnant go to the doctors and have them do a blood test to find out. And member every woman is diff with morning sickness. I did have morning sickness but I have a friend who didn't so with that part their is know right or wrong answer.          GOOD LUCK  16 weeks 1 day preganant
umGzyElZaa	I hear and have seen, that its not too accurate at all!    They told my sister at 37 weeks that my nephew would be 11lbs!  The did a c-section and he as 8lbs 9oz...way off...but still big baby!    They told my friend, that just had her baby about 2 weeks ago, that at 37 weeks he was 8lbs 3oz, she went into labor about a week later, and he was 7lbs 14oz.    So, I probably wouldn't trust it!  With my son, I never had an ultra-sound done to check it. But he weighed 8lbs 9oz and I had a c-section. The last few weeks I didn't gain any weight, so I'm guessing he didn't. I actually lost weight! So even right now, your sooo close to your due date, if he puts on a few oz it will be ok! (I'm sure that's off though!) Even though I couldn't have my son naturally, I know people that have given birth to babies that weight, and they were fine!  Congrats and good luck with everything!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Pretty accurate. I was told my daughter would be between 7 1/2lbs - 8lbs, she was 7lbs 6oz. Remember ultrasounds can be a pound or two off either way :)|`|Pf9fyEyQaa	I think it can be pretty far off.  My friend just had her baby and she was told that the baby would be at least 8lbs...she was 6lbs 1oz.    Another friend of mine was told her baby would be really small...around 4 or 5 lbs, she had a 6lbs 12oz baby boy.    I don't know about the longer arms and legs thing...I guess it might make it harder to measure because they would be more cramped up!  Baby is healthy though and that's all that matters!!!|`|8WRnqs08aa	Give or take 1 pound!    1st estimated at 8 lbs, born @ 8lbs. 8oz  2nd estimated at 8 lbs, born @ 7lbs 8oz  3rd estimated at 8.5 lbs, born @ 9lbs 2oz  4th estimated at 7 - 8lbs, born @ 7lbs. 10oz.|`|AA10186411	Usually + or - 15 ounces.  They estimated my daughter at 7 lbs 15 oz and she was 7 lbs 5.5 oz|`|WPI0Z47saa	They were almost dead on with my son. They were off 2oz. It is fairly accurate but could be 1 pound more or on pound less.
Wz9tSKTaaa	OK babies _do_not_ simply inherit one of their parents' blood types. That may hold true a lot of the time because obviously there is a connection and there are only 4 ABO types, but it is more complex than that. As Noz, Brass and Cath indicate it isn't possible for an AB and O combination to have an AB or an O child.    ABO blood types are determined by 2 alleles (gene-versions) per person, 1 inherited from each parent, out of A, B and O. A and B alleles are both dominant to O such that a person with 1A and 1O allele has A type blood just as surely as if they had 2As. So blood type and allele combinations line up like this:    Type.....Alleles  ..AB....1A & 1B  ...A....2As or 1A & 1O  ...B....2Bs or 1B & 1O  ...O.........2Os    So the children of an AB and an O will be either 1A1O (A type) or 1B1O (B type). The +/- isn't a problem, so I won't go into that.    If, despite this, you're pretty sure this baby belongs to these parents, there are a few possible explanations. The most likely is a simple mis-typing. It's rare but not unheard of for some subtypes of A to be mistested as O. There is also a very rare gene called the cis-AB gene which really can cause a form of AB type with just 1 allele, even if the pairing allele is O.    Overall, if you want really strong proof of parentage, get a DNA test done.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	No. Baby gets one type from mum and one from dad. Mum can't give baby both the A and the B. Baby will be either A or B, and can be either + or -.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	No, but the baby can have o-.  My mom, me and my son all are o-.|`|iZDsMCghaa	Yes. The baby has one of the two blood types of the parents.|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	yes|`|61eadcf38f72b14203ed398198796d52aa	No.  The baby can have A or B with a - or + rh factor,  but not AB or O.|`|qStmw7qgaa	Sure.  I'm O+ and my husband is A+. My daughter is A+|`|9EMR6BHFaa	Yes.|`|5SCMfucFaa	No. AB means you have both the co-dominant A and B genes. O requires you to have two recessive O genes. This means the only possibilities for the offspring are AO and BO, meaning the child must have bloodtype A or B with an equal chance of each.|`|AA10717561	They can have any blood type
FAQldsUZaa	Ok, well I have a 4 year old and an 8 month old. I only have one phallopian tube, and my husband was just diagnosed w/ Testicular Cancer... so he was only working w/ one testicle. If your trying to get pregnant... don't give up. It can get discouraging, but most often, it will happen. It took about 8 months to conceive our 1st daughter and then about a year and a 1/2 to conceive the baby. And now we know the true reason... we thought it was me. I was even put on Clomid, but only did 2 cycles of it.     ?Good Luck?|`|AcOVnKtlaa	Hello Kitty,    Having a low  sperm count can be devastating, especially for couples who has been planning to have a child. But, it doesn't mean there's nothing you can do to fix it.There are ultimate ways to conquer low sperm count, and actually it's quite simple.      Zinc.  Research shows that average person is lack of nutrition in six of the eight vitamins and minerals that are recommended for a healthy body. Less than one in ten receive the recommended daily allowance for zinc-an essential nutrient for sperm production. Zinc is vital for viable sperm count, motility, and a high percentage of live sperm in the semen. Zinc is implied in semen and therefore men lose significant amount of zinc during the ejaculation. So it is important that zinc is replace by the food we eat. Food rich in zinc such as lambs, turkeys, barley, wheat, beans, nuts, raw sunflowers, and pumpkin seeds are considered to be the super-foods that can help you increasing sperm count. Oysters are often said to be a great aphrodisiac, but it's also great for increasing sperm count.      Cut out junk and processed food. There is one thing you have to know about process foods. During the manufacturing process, the essential nutrients are removed from the food in order to increase the longevity of the food. In addition, the cooking process later on will further removes the remaining nutrients. So to eliminate the removal of vitamins and minerals from your foods, it is highly recommended to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables as well as eat them raw whenever possible.    There's more you have to know about increasing low sperm count. You can see it on source articles.|`|R3b4c9Egaa	My cousin and his wife were going to pay for IVF as he had been diagnosed with extremely low sperm count when he was around 16.     He is now 42 and has been married for 2 years and has a beautiful baby girl called Tilly who was born in November. This all happened naturally as they "gave up hope and stopped trying" and it just happened.    I've got no doubts that it'll happen for you, it might just take a little bit longer. Good luck!!!
WPI0Z47saa	You aren't supposed to lay flat on your back for anything after 4 months because you put pressure on a major vein and can cut down on the blood supply ging to your baby.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Actually, Missionary is one of the best positions if you have a sensitive cervix. It's the shallowest penetration. If she's getting some bleeding from that, it could be just normal spotting, but if she's worried she should see the doctor. Get it confirmed by the doc that sex is okay. She should probably try something different, like spooning maybe. Nothing that allows deeper penetration.|`|kH56qw2Taa	well i havent been in any other position since i found out i was pregnant other than my back and i havent bled im sure its safe xx|`|N83Po9PZaa	Have sex however you want, which means whichever way doesn't hurt. I found that when I was tiny pregnant, having this little knot of a baby poke up and down out of my belly drove me crazy. Once the kid was bigger, it didn't bother me.|`|627pWyVkaa	you can bleed because your cervix becomes sensitive and may have more blood in it(flowing to it). your not suppose to lay on your back past a certain month aprox. month 4 and up because it decreases blood flow to you and your baby, and stops the oxygen from getting to you and your baby which is very unhealthy. That is why you shouldnt be on your back for very long. Your cervix may bleed at anytime, However its common from sex, its normal. Of course if it doesnt stop it may be from something else, then you should get that checked out.
N48qV69daa	Tell her that you are sorry to hear that. Theres not a lot you can say to make it better. Let her know if she needs anything that you are here for her.|`|1hzkIoxcaa	say oh im sry i know how tough that can be   if u need anything im always here for you           cerebral palsy is a very serious dissease   my cuz has it he is 32 and in a home   most people die from it|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Hmmm... I would just let this girl know that you are there for her if she wants to talk, but wouldn't bring it up just to chat about it. She may or may not be sensitive on the subject. I myself am not very familiar with CP, but can understand and respect that when a child has a serious health condition the parents may choose to handle it with openness or may not want to think about it very much.|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	There isn't a lot you can say, but that is her child and she needs support from you.  I have a friend whose daughter has CP (mild) and a co-worker whose son has a severs case, he can't walk or talk and just stays curled up in his wheelchair.  It's sad, but it is a reality for so many people.    Ask how old he is and his name.  Ask is he addicted to the popular cartoons on TV, say what your daughtrer likes to watch.  (even my co-workers son loves to watch TV)     You can be supportive without bring up the CP.|`|Em3pzq8Uaa	cp is a serious illness. its not contageous. it effects the limbs and delays the speech. sometimes it can be caused my lack of oxygen to the brain during birth. my daughter was diagnosed with mild cp. but has gotten over it. she has learned to deal with it. just be there for your friend, but dont bring it up unless she talks about it. children are a gift from god. weather they are handicaped or not. we love them all the same.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	I think *In love with Rory* hit the nail on the head.    If she wants to elaborate, she will. If not, let it go until you both become more reacquainted.
JnLoHaoAaa	I think it depends how the parents feel. Personally I don't think it's a bad idea, but it's ok to wait for kindergarten too. I started school when I was 3 but because I wanted to. I would always get excited seeing the school bus every day.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	You know me and my situation.  That said, if I were a stay-at-home mom or had the option for family to watch them, I would still be sending my boys to preschool 2X per week.  It's definitely not a waste of money IF you find the right one.|`|4gZYucHMaa	I wait until they're ready for kindergarten....I have no need to rush them as I like staying at home with them. Plus they learn bc I purchase these books like they get at school that's geared for their age where they can learn shapes, colours etc. I sit down with my kids and do these with them.    I don't think pre-school is that important unless you can't teach them this stuff yourself or if you've already been putting them in daycare all along then it's pretty much the same thing.    Our school board is also amazing, they really push the kids--I think to hard at times where my daughter was in kindergarten having homework every single night.    My son is 3, not in preschool but can count upto 12, knows his entire alphabet and recognizes shape.  My daughter is 7 and she's at the top of her class and learning at Grade 2 level....I believe as a parent to teach them myself and give them the best lead I can.|`|AA10186411	Kindergarten is NOT what it was when we were little.  They expect children to be able to read a certain number of words, do simple math, and other things.  Unless you sit at home with your child day in and day out to teach them these things, they won't learn.  I put my daughter in daycare/preschool because not only do they teach her what she needs to know, but she is getting adapted to a classroom setting, so she won't go completely biizzurk when she goes to Kindergarten.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	I had them both in preschool, trust me ! They never had after that "anxiety fear" when they started school ! They loved to learn and be with other children. My kids are 7 and 9 years old now and they are very bright, both of them !|`|4e67Pdfvaa	pre school is now the real kindergarten...  kindergarten is waaay advanced now from when we were kids.  They don't just learn alphabet.. they are expected to know it all along with sounds etc when they come.|`|zQWNb6neaa	I think it is a GREAT way to prepare children for Kindergarten. My daughter (4) is in her second year of preschool and will enter Kindergarten this fall, at which time my 3 year old son will start preschool. I did not choose schools lightly, I asked around and even got feedback from Kindergarten Teachers in the area on which school best prepared children for their classrooms. I believe so much is expected of our children anymore, even entering into Kindergarten, that I felt/feel obligated to do as much as I can to prepare them for their school career.|`|yzFxc5uXaa	pre school is pretty necessary now, its more then just preparing socially for kindergarten you learn basic beginning skills of math and letters and such... plus usually kids that dont attend kindergarten do have a harder time interacting with their classmates|`|LeY6hx4Laa	I think its good to take them as it will help them prepare and wont seem such a bis change when they start school full time, my son went pre-school and he was more confident, i think it give them a bit of a head start too and make lots of new friends.|`|nrQijvMuaa	I say it worth the money! My biggest mistake was having my son stay home with me. I wasn't prepared to send him to pre school and when it came around the time for kinder it was a big overwhelmed situation for my son that he cried every day 4 two weeks straight. It broke my heart every time. He wasn't as social and friendly & had trouble sharing. I feel if I had sent him to school he would have been more social and would know the concept of sharing at the time and he probably wouldn't have cried. I agree sending a child to preschool is the best bet.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	Personally I think it is a waste of money but not time. I would rather get a group of mommies and kids together and go places like the library, swimming , skating, science centres, nature centres or just at home colouring, exploring and stuff. I also plan on community unschooling our children. I'm a stay at home mom so I have time for this sort of thing. My opinion might be different if I were out in the work force.|`|i7oGjwJBaa	I find it so sad that we are basically forcing people to put their kids in to preschool - only so they don't have to worry about having the 1 child in kindergarten that didn't go to preschool and have their child look unintelligent in comparison.  preschool is not a necessity.  children that young can learn all those things at home by playing and reading books.  it's fine to have kids involved in things if they really enjoy it - but i can't appreciate the fact that people feel like they have no choice anymore.  i had my children in daycare for a few months before i quit to stay home with them.  we sacrificed all non-essential spending so that i could be home with them, and we could not afford preschool even if we wanted to.  i will be placing my children in cyber schools from home so we don't need to worry about being behind or ahead of the other kids.  My daughter is 3.5 and already knows everything on the kindergarten skills lists anyway.  preschool is definitely not a requirement as long as you are playing with and reading to your child daily like you should be.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	I think there are some positive things about preschool....it does help your child get acclimated to school, the setting, making friends, following rules etc.      If you are an active parent at home with your child, the "education" your child gets from you as a parent will be just as good if not better than what preschool can provide.    Both of my kids went to mother's morning out programs...they were thru a local church, they had a classroom and teacher, they learned letters and colors and such, and it was only a few 1/2 days a week.  It gave me a much needed break to go grocery shopping alone or do paperwork in peace and the kids enjoyed it for the most part.    I am not a big fan of daycare, all day long away from Mommy & Daddy, and some preschools are really just glorified daycare|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I'm waiting until kindergarten. My kids can be taught many things they will need to know by me and their dad. I figure if you're going to be in school for 13 years, not counting if you go to college, the 5 years you can have your kids at home is worth it. I think it's kind of sad when parents put their kids in preschool at 2 or 3. It's as if the parents want then away from then asap. Unless, of course, the kid wants to go. I would never keep my kids from going if they asked. That would be selfish on my part.|`|0WstfAmzaa	For me it would depend on a lot of factors.. Does the child have siblings or cousins or other friends around her age that she plays and interacts with regularly?  Is she good at sharing, or is she a little on the spoiled side?  Do I as a mother get enough time in the day to play with her, talk to her and teach her the basics (such as the ABCs, etc)..  Is she talkative and outgoing, or is she quiet and shy?      After I considered all these questions, I would make the decision as to whether my child would go to preschool a couple days a week at the age of 4, or if I'll just wait till she hits Kindergarden.    EDIT:  Not all kids will go bezerk at entering school in Kindergarden instead of going to preschool.  I never went to preschool and I did great in Kindergarden.  My little brother went and he hated school.  My aunts three kids all went straight to Kindergarder, 2 out of the 3 in all-day Kindergarden and adjusted very well to school.  The youngest didn't even know her ABCs properly yet when she started and now, she refuses to miss a day of school.|`|0dqfwKk7aa	I'm a kindergarten teacher and I can tell you from experience.  Depending on where you live, pre-school might be as bad as kinder.  There will be standards and goals must be met...and kids learn to fail at such an early age.  It's sad to see a child's self-esteem suffer just because he can't perform as well as his classmates.     I would say it is worth it if it's an environment that is developmentally appropriate for a 4 year old.  Ex. a lot of play, hands-on activities, make-believe, oral language development and so on.  If it doesn't then it's not worth it.  you can teach your child the basic things he needs to start kinder...such as, holding a pencil correctly, coloring, some knowledge of letters and number.  The social aspect of pre-school can be given by having your child play with other children.    You can look for your state's standards on-line and get idea of what is being taught at each grade level.|`|488edafbffd854a7df677efa90768cabaa	I didn't send my oldest daughter to preschool. We really didn't have the money at the time and she was in other things like sunday school that took care of the socialization issue. I worked with her personally and she did great in kindergarten. She's in second grade now and they're talking about putting her in the gifted and talented program.    Now with my youngest, I think that we will put her in preschool for two days a week next year but I admit that it's more for me than for her. She's just as bright as her older sister and involved in the same kinds of things. Still, I'm trying to start working from home and could use the time without little ones. So the answer for my family is that no, it's not necessary but sometimes desirable.    Now I have a friend whose daughter has socialization issues. Preschool has been an invaluable tool in getting that child ready for school. In fact, it has done her a world of good. I would say for that family the answer was yes, it was absolutely necessary.    I think each family has to weigh the pros and cons and decide what is best for their situation.|`|9e2d43d3ae63af8660a877c9ec79937daa	I have a child who went to preschool and one that did not. The child that did not go to preschool is struggling in school. He is behind the other kids and has not been able to catch up. He is in second grade now and I honestly do not know if I should let him move up to third grade. We are currently discussing options. His main problem is that he does not write as quickly as the other kids which puts him behind in his work and then he gives up. If I had put him in preschool he would have learned how to write his letters and read some before kindergarten and he would have been equal to his peers. My daughter that did go to preschool is excelling in school and is in the top of her grade. I know they have different personalities and learning styles but I do think that preschool made a huge difference. My daughter is in fourth grade.|`|8wXw5xhHaa	Preschool is just 3 years that your kid could be earning money. ha!    I think preschool is a gigantic scam.  YOU can teach your kid the alphabet and colors and numbers. The people who work at preschool are MOMS just like you or college kids, with no special "pre-school teacher" license or anything.      Save your money. Teach your kids yourself. Get them "socialized" by having them actually play with other children.
FgAPXhVRaa	My mom was a labor and delivery nurse for 15 years. She always told me that if the baby was in the right position, there was a possibility that you could tell.

Other than that I think 12 weeks is too soon even for and experienced sonographer. I've heard that though, about the angle but there's that HUGE possiblitly that it could be wrong. I wouldn't start getting baby girl things just yet.

What you are talking about is the angle of the genitals (because they look the same for boys and girls up until 16 weeks). That theory has been proven wrong and has an inaccuracy rate of over 50%. If you want to believe what she told you, by all means do, but don't paint the nursery pink until you get a confirmation.|`|vDcq64lqaa	sure she could be right. i mean, she's got a 50 50 chance...but My doctor told me My Baby was a girl by pointing a couple of bones too...of course...i was 20 weeks though.

PBY9MNDFaa	I would think you would get a positive using Clearblue or 1st Response the day before your period.  I take it you are worried about drinking?  If so, then I would stick to soft drinks just to be sure.  Just tell your pal that you are not feeling so good, but that you would rather come to her party and not drink, than miss it altogether.  Good luck with your BFP if you get it.|`|V8uvefQDaa	First Response or Clear Blue!!|`|10mOwk0Taa	Test before you go out.  If you get a negative though, don't use that as a reason to drink.

9OsjdsrZaa	Ouch!  I sympathize with you!  This is not something that is easy to deal with.  I have had the same problem with each of my children to varying degrees.     Does he wake up because he is uncomfortable?  (Acid Reflux)  Sometimes babies who have this condition have a hard time sleeping for long periods on their backs because this.  If he does have this condition...try propping him up on his side, or their are products on the market that are basically crib wedges.  They can prop the mattress up at an angle and help with reflux.    If he does not have acid reflux, and he is just having a hard time sleeping through the night...it is time to teach him.  I don't think that it is necessarily an issue of solids or not.  Babies have to learn how to sleep right.  I now it sounds odd...but not one of my 3 children came out knowing how to sleep through the night.  Some people had those miracle babies that just seemed to get it right...Mine never did.      I have used a couple of methods that have worked for me.  They are:    Put them to bed tired, but awake.  Most babies just need to learn to send themselves to sleep.  My biggest mistake with my first, was always putting her to sleep when she was sleeping.  She never learned how to fall asleep on her own.  When she woke up...which was often, she wanted me to feed her and help her go to sleep again.  When she hit 6 months, I had reached my end.  After trying everything, I went with letting her cry it out.    Letting them cry it out.  Tough love is one of the HARDEST things to do as a parent.  You hear them crying and the only thing you want to do is go get them.  The first night my daughter cried for 1 hour.  The second night 1/2 hour, the third night...not at all.  Granted this method is not for everyone.  I also wouldn't recommend it to parents with newborns.  It should be used as a last resort.  There are variations to this method...like the 10 minute check up.  This is when you go in every 10 minutes and pat their back and comfort(without picking up), or sing a soothing lullaby...eventually working from every 10 minutes to every 20 minutes and so forth.  For me, I just let her cry it out.    Make sure that what ever method you decide on...you keep to a scheduled routine.  Whether it is a bath and stories or quite time be consistent.  Make sure his bedtime is the same every night, that he has the same story or song every night.  This will clue him in that it is bedtime.    Hopefully sooner then you realize, your little will be on your schedule not his.    I am expecting my 4th, and if he is anything like my 3rd...I know I am in for some LONG nights.  Although I have learned a lot with my first 3, I am always surprised at the loops they send me through.  Good luck with your little one.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I have a 10 month old that is just now starting to give me a good 6hr stretch a few times a week. Waking 6 times isn't unusual for us either. Nothing I have found helps. Once my son started to periodically give me 6hrs I started to refuse nursing for the first 4hrs of the night, I know he can make it at least that long. I still put him back to sleep other ways but not with nursing. He didn't care for it at first but eventually started giving me the 4hr stretch which is improvement. After we got good at that I pushed it to 6hrs. At this point I am not comfortable pushing it any further than that, he has never gone longer on his own. 6 solid hours is decent sleep in my book.    This has been done while co-sleeping. I couldn't manage any other way. My husband will not get up at night.|`|iMY2fgYdaa	I would like to suggest you go out and grab a copy of   becoming baby wise....its all about helping your baby to get on a regular sleep cycle...I am a first time mom...we did it and our son only got up 2 times a nite for the first 4 weeks then it was only once a nite and at 2 mos old he slept threw the night and still does...its an amazing thing    check it out!|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	It's normal and expected for him to get up through the night.  Solids are not the solution.  They should never take place of a feeding prior to 12 months- they're only in addition to breastmilk.    He gets up to nurse through the night because he needs that nutrition.  Breastfed babies are expected to get at least 25% of their nutritional requirements during the night.    Personally, I co-sleep through the first year for that reason alone.  I just roll over, pop her on, and dose off nursing.  Sometimes I stay asleep that way.  It makes things so much easier than geting up.    Doctors are really misinformed when they say that a baby should be sleeping through the night by the time he doubles his weight.  That's really only for formula fed babies, and even then it's not necessarily going to happen.    Don't make the mistake of assuming that if he slept for a long stretch before that he should be going that long now.  Do not refuse nursing sessions.  You can't compare his physiology at two months (or whatever) to now.  He gets up because he needs the nutrition now.  His body is growing at a different rate than it was earlier.|`|dXMdt3gVaa	Five months old is still so young. So I would just take it that your son obviously needs a lot of nutrients. I know by five months I was still up the whole night with my daughter. So its very common. Just take it in your stride mommy! I know the sleep deprivation is enough to kill you but its worth it in the end to have a happy baby who grows well :)|`|DDFSITiYaa	I am guessing he is waking up more out of habit than out of need.  Co-sleeping is probably exacerbating the problem as he knows you are there.      I would probably cut back on the number of times you feed in the night.  This may mean you try soothing him another way.  When he wakes, don't nurse him.  Just pat him or rock him or give him a pacifier - replace the nursing.  Try doing that for maybe the earliest feed.  You know that he can go more than 4 hours without feeding so try to stretch it.|`|aUifz2a4aa	Is he nursing to sooth himself? Does he have a night time routine? If not, try doing the same thing every night..bath, feed book, bed.  When he wakes try to sooth him rather then comfort nurse if that is what he is doing.  My little guy 1 weeks, sleeps from 7pm-3am without a feed. I feed him and back to bed till 630, up again till 8am and then a 30 minute nap, and then he doesn't nap again till the afternoon.  We give him a couple ounces of expressed milk at night, then I nurse.  Also he recently has not liked his crib, so he has spent the last few nights in a swing. I know some might not agree with this, but it works for us.
EHY3FnAmaa	I am sure ALL labor hurts.  My induction was a good expereince, I got the epidural and I reccommend it to every woman.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Well, the truth is, it only hurts if it's working.  That's how they know.  I dozed off on my first round of Pitocin and that's how they knew to up the dose.  Unfortunate, but true.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Whether induced or spontantous, labor hurts. But yes, most women who are induced say that induced labor is much more  painful.|`|ad0F70IMaa	They broke my water with both my kids. Truthfully, it was very painful for me, but after they broke it, i was allowed to get my epidural. Hope this helps.|`|459948c9c4124486ce62f73d24b95fe3aa	All labor hurts.  Induced labor tends to be more painful because of instead of allowing the woman to build up to strong contractions, the strong contractions start from the very beginning.  If you can avoid it, I would.|`|0nb1rQhnaa	Don't be a hero- get an epidural. You'll be fine!|`|WG941bbDaa	When I was induced they gave me the pill to induce me which I hear is supose to be better then the pitocin.  The pitocin apparently makes the labor pains stronger.  When I took the pill...My labor definately was strong...but I think that's just normal labor.  It all hurts.  I would definately reccommend the epideral though.  I wasn't that into getting one until my labor progressed and I'm so glad I did it.  I was able to sleep for 5 hours.  With first time mom's labor usually lasts a little longer...so I would reccommend getting all the comfortable sleep you can.  I pushed for my son for 3 hours...and then they had to use the vacuum to get him out...and I had to get stitches.  But trust me...it's all worth it.  I wouldn't trade him or the experience for anything.  Now I'm pregnant again and my son is only 4 months...so obviously it's worth the pain..or I wouldn't do it again lol.  Good luck and don't worry you'll be fine!|`|Qk4eZ9U1aa	Yeah, having a baby hurts..a lot. Having your labor induced means you will potentially have stronger contractions and will progress faster. They will monitor your progress (dilation, effacement, contraction intervals) and the baby's response (heart rate, activity) and adjust the Pitocin as needed. If you are worried about pain I would go ahead and let the hospital and/or your doctor know that you would like an epidural so that it can be ready for you. If you miss your window you could have to go natural....ugh. Good luck!|`|XPnCeJ29aa	well they turned my pitocin up every freaking hour.  It hurt like hell, beyond hell!  I was firmly against the epidural until I was gettin contractions in a row without any break in between. I went on pitocin at 5 and took the epidural at 9 and i was at 8 cms.  They didnt give me a high dose because I was so far dialted but my labor slowed down after the epidural, and there was little to no pain after that.  Then when it became time to push I started feeling the contractions again on my right side, they wouldnt give me any more meds and told me just to start pushing.  Feeling the contractions actaully made it easier to push because I could tell when to, and I pushed for 45 minutes and he was born at 12:12 am.  I was also on morphine because I was induced for high blood pressure so I was really f'ed up on meds, they told me the morphine would make me feel like I was hit by a truck, and uhhh I did!!|`|SRY26lUTaa	It hurts when you start having contractions. Just ask for a epidural then you wont be in so much pain.|`|jOBBlJnvaa	I was induced as a first time mom and even though i have nothing to compair it to, I can tell you that the labor pains come on a whole lot stronger than if I wasn't. I was given a suppository that helps ripen the cervix...about 3 hours after, and no progress my contractions were happening 10 seconds apart. This cause the baby to have stress and his heart rate to drop severely. They had to stop my labor with a shot and allow it to continue on its own. Even when I was pushing my contractions weren't happening 10 seconds apart. Don't be afraid to have an epidural, I don't know what I would have done with out one. My little guy was posterior and I had horrible back labor that I could feel even through my epidural. Good Luck with your labor!
rVNdYGHmaa	mine was a little bloody.. looks "mucusy" a tad brown... you can kinda feel it...you know how you can kinda feel when your period starts? thats how it feels... doesnt hurt at all tho|`|ii0C0tfXaa	Mine didnt hurt, its been comming out since they stripped my membranes, i just started getting kinda bad cramps and a backache ...thats what hurts but the plug comming out doesnt hurt, just a bit akward feeling. anyways congradulations on the baby to be only 8 weeks left (maybe less) :-)|`|OoaZGumxaa	Mine didn't hurt. I got up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, and noticed that my panties were already wet lol. It just looks like a bunch of mucus. Mine was streaked with blood. My contractions started about 5 minutes later. Heavy mucus is common in pregnancy so don't get overly upset. If you start having contractions, call your doctor.
PJA7WBt1aa	Le perdite, che hai nel periodo fertile, si riferiscono al muco che produce la tua cervice, non per questo si chiama muco cervicale.  Possono essere di quantit esigua e abbondante, ma non dipende da essa la capacit maggiore o minore di concepire.  Inoltre il muco, perch sia di natura fertile, deve seguire un'evoluzione....da acquoso, a gelatinoso,filamentoso a trasparente ed elastico simile alla chiara dell'uovo crudo.  Nel giorno del  picco ( che pu coincidere o essere preludio dell'ovulazione imminentissima....al massimo entro le 24 ore ) il muco  trasparentissimo e perde ogni traccia di bianco.  Dopo l'ovulazione, nell'attesa del flusso mestruale ( dopo 14 giorni esatti dal picco ) il muco torner ad essere dapprima asciuttto, poi bianco o giallino colloso, cremoso.  Ribadisco, per, che ai fini della fertilit, non conta la quantit delle secrezioni, ma l'evoluzione del muco stesso.|`|1OGiMul9aa	Si e` proprio da li che ti rendi conto che sei entrata nel periodo piu` fertile....|`|UivwOHwYaa	scusa ma in che senso l'ovulazione  abbondante?!  mi sa che non ti sei spiegata molto bene.  DUrante il periodo fertile della nostra vita (tra il menarca e la menopausa) con l'ovulazione noi donne produciamo ogni mese un ovulo (al massimo due)... e gi vuol dire che siamo fertili!  se ti riferisci alla quantit di sangue durante il ciclo, allora non credo ci sia una relazione.  se invece come ovulazione intendi la quantit di muco che produci nel periodo fertile, sinceramente non so se ci sia una relazione tra la quantit e la ferilit  ma non credo, ci sono donne che non avvertono muco eppure sono fertili! (se mi sbaglio dovr rileggermi qualcosa sul metodo billings!) :)|`|SIZAyivraa	certo. le perdite ti fanno capire ke quello  il tuo periodo fertile se sono trasparenti e filamentose. mentre se dense e quasi gialline che il tuo periodo fertile  finito. l'ovulazione come tu saprai di solito si ha inizio intorno al 14o giorno. l'ovulo una volto espulso dall'ovaio vive per circa 24 ore e se nel momento in cui esce sono presenti gli spermatozoi pu essere fecondato. massima attenzione quindi se hai un ciclo regolare dall'11o al 17o giorno.
GY4yYB6jaa	That doesnt sound too good to me. The odd glass here and there is acceptable, but getting downright drunk is NOT. That alcohol will be being passed on to her child, you seriously need to discuss this matter with her.    She had 5 glasses of wine whils she was pregnant!? This is not acceptable behaviour, and yes I fear that the child has and is being affected by this.    You know the situation, you need to decide whether speaking to her about it is enough, of whether contacting social services might be a good idea.    |`|9f781acdd2a8d587f475cd9992a7adeaaa	The alcohol gets to the baby through her breastmilk. She needs to stop before she causes some problems and possibly loose her child.|`|ZzCVysPiaa	Drinking alcoholic beverages while breastfeeding is horrible and should never be done!|`|JQZDCcyQaa	Are you sure she wasnt pumping and dumping the milk? and feeding her from a bottle? just before you start making accusations? if you are sure then you should report her to the authorities, its not good for the baby, i think her attitude stinks if she thinks like that, that alone would make me wonder what else she is doing|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	To be drunk on 2 occasions while breastfeeding although not great is very unlikely to cause any long term ill effects on the baby - it can make the baby hyperactive or sleepy.    Sustained heavy drinking while breastfeeding can cause developmental issues, particularly around motor skills.    Alcohol does not pass into breast milk the same way it does into your bloodstream so even if she was drunk the baby would not be getting a full dose of what she had consumed. Alcohol also passes out of the breastmilk over a period of time.    I am interested as to why when she came to your house pregnant you served her 5 glasses of wine, I possibly would have put the bottle away if it looked like she had no self control and abstained myself so she didn't feel the peer pressure to join in drinking with dinner. My friends used to buy me alcohol free wine and beer when I went for dinner which was great as I didn;t feel left out.     edit:    The baby does NOT get drunk - some people really need to read up on this! Speak to someone from the NCT of La Leche League and they will give you the facts on this. Ruby T is right, it can affect breastmilk production, also some babies won't nurse if mother has been drinking.     If she does this regularly - as a friend would you not speak to her about it?|`|nDUTP8TSaa	If she gets drunk the baby gets drunk. The babies respiratory system could fail. Sounds like an alcoholic to me. Does this idiot have a husband? |`|Ad3hRmh4aa	It's not actually as dangerous as you would think. It's recommended breastfeeding mums don't drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week, and no more than 3 units a day (sounds like she might have had more than this on occasions though). The worst affect it has is that it reduces the rate of production of breast milk, so it may be harder for the baby to suckle and it might not get as much milk as usual if the mum's had a drink. Alcohol doesn't pass over to the baby through breast milk to the extent it does if you drink while the baby's still in the womb, although it is advised NOT to drink directly before breastfeeding. No one is perfect, and if she's drinking really heavily then of course this is cause for concern. But she's breastfeeding, which is best for her baby and she should be supported with this as much as possible, not vilified for having a drink xx    EDIT: I do see your concern when she was obviously drunk, which I referred to in my answer. I just get annoyed with people calling her an 'idiot' and such like, it just seems we are all so judgemental nowadays. But, if you are worried then just discuss it with your friend, she may not see anything wrong with being drunk and breastfeeding until someone - politely and calmly- points her in the right direction.|`|OJrq5sZLaa	Thats awful! What we consume, when breast feeding goes through us and into the milk. If your friend is drinking alcohol, she's passing it on to the baby.    When I was breast feeding with my last baby, we had a night out and I had a couple of glasses of wine, to overcome passing it on to my daughter, I just expressed all the milk for the next 24 hours and threw it away.    What your friend is doing could be seriously harmful, have you told her that you're concerned. Sounds like someone needs to tell her that she's wrong and endangering her child.|`|7QjlDvs6aa	I know a couple of women like this they dont seem to care and I think that they shouldnt be aloud to have babies. Anyway yes the baby does get drunk, yes there are studies that shoew that it can cause long term damage ie slow learners. How does this womn think that her daughter likes getting drunk? Anyway google affect of alcohol on baby while breastfeeding Good luck|`|NZNWaC1Faa	Hello, breastfeed babies are indeed healthy ones.There are certain things that mom shouldn't eat, like Greens, will cause colic.Drinking  alcohol, tapper ed to a lower level.|`|69DjSUVAaa	Everybody has different opinions regarding drinking whilst breastfeeding. Recently i was watching something on one of the baby channels and they said a glass of wine in the evenings would not harm the baby but has be known to help the baby if it has colic as a minimal amount gets through to the milk. Then she did follow it up with she would never condone it.   I would mention you worries to your friend as she wouldn't thank you if you got others involved as someone suggested.  Good luck x

Baby's love them and they are a god send too you two! lol you cab have a bit of me time whilst they are in them id highly recommend them but not the M&P Start lite swing as i have that one its not that good but the Graco one's are very good.    Hope this helps |`|fxG7Zs6Aaa	hi this is the perfect time to buy him a swing that is about the age that my little boy got his. he will be 2 in november and he still likes his swing. he doesnt sit in it much because i wont let him but he loves it and they can use it for a while as long as u have them buckled in. now i do need to add the  my little boy is skinny so ya know the bigger the baby the shorter time but he weighs about 25-30 pounds and he can still sit in it. and my other little boys are twins they are 14 months old and they are still in it but they were born 3 months premature so they are the size of 11 month olds but either way u have a while before he will grow out of it.|`|uXdx9vuBaa	i started using the swing when my baby was about three weeks old. Most baby swings recline back.  She loves her swing and it calms her down and it also entertains her for an hour straight.  sometimes she falls asleep in it for almost 1.5 hours.  Now she is two months and she is starting to not want to be in it for a long time like before. She still likes her swing but she will stay in it for about 30 minutes at most vs an hour.  I think every baby is diff't b/c my son didnt like the swing and would cry in it.  We didnt use it for a long time.  Since your baby is 10 months old and is probably standing, i wouldnt buy one.  Once they start to crawl or stand, they dont want to be anywhere confined.  So if you are going to by a swing, buy a used one.  You can get a used one anywhere between $15.00 to $30.00. This way if he doenst like it or outgrows it fast, you wont lose money.  I would probably get a jolly jumper or something like that at your babys age b/c they like to move alot and explore.  If you do get a swing, get one that has the different speeds. Vibration doesnt do anything to be honest.  |`|jIJ3obFOaa	well my baby is 18 lbs at 5 months and she loves her swings. we have the rainforest one which goes up to 25 lbs and a sit upright one that goes to 30 lbs. youll never know til you try it. some kids hate the swing others they find it relaxing|`|NZNWaC1Faa	  Hello, you can buy an indoor swing, it will also help to put him asleep.  and keep him occupied while you do chores around the house.|`|v75KduzHaa	depends some swings a lot as long as its on a low speed|`|7e7591279f1087572bea2e0eac58af3faa	Darion whay dont you start actually answering questions instead of wishing people luck....all your answers are the same?!

You need to mingle and socialise so that he can see what is normal.|`|IP2suWFTaa	He just feels safe and secure with you.Don't push him away,it can be traumatizing to him.Its normal for children of his age to be so attached to his mother.He will slowly learn to trust others as long as you assure him ,that the people he will be around aren't going to harm him.If he knows that you trust someone he will trust them as well,because you are his security blanket and he feels safe with your decisions.|`|bjqjkDMHaa	Your son might have Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism.  I have it.  When I was little, I did my own thing and stood  behind my mom, playing with imaginary horses and stuff...talk to a child psychiatrist about this.  They can help him develop social skills if in a few years he doesn't 'bloom' socially.|`|ibeYAlwpaa	Are you a stay at home parent? Maybe volunteer at a preschool once a week so your son can get that extra time with other children|`|jkgl9WMgaa	He's three.  He has normal separation anxiety.  I would not worry about it, but you might plan opportunities for him to play with other children or spend time around others while you are there.  Then begin to leave him for short periods of time (like at daycare or a friends house) so that he can get used to the fact that you will come back.  His fear is not of other people, it is that if you leave, he cannot be sure you will come back.|`|94a35c89cad76d7f41e298b8c841e4f5aa	Repeat this mantra whenever you wonder why he acts like this, or why he can't be more mature, or whatever.  It has helped me with my son.    "HE IS NOT A MINIATURE ADULT".    He is not a miniature adult.  He has only been on this earth for 3 years and he feels safe with you.      He is not a miniature adult.  Repeat after me.  He is not a miniature adult.
7bTOY5vHaa	I think its rude. The only people that anyone should suggest a  certain gift from is the grandparents. With the way the economy is right now most people cant afford extra gifts.|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	I wouldn't find it rude; but i would buy a pack of diapers and spend a lot less on a small gift to go with it.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	I dont think it is rude, its not like you have to buy a gift and diapers, your gift could be diapers. Everybody knows that babies go through a lot of diapers, and it seems like since people have started registering for gifts nobody brings diapers anymore.|`|ykP7I3caaa	Some people may think that's rude, but it wouldn't bother me.|`|v3LnJycKaa	not rude at all, you can get her a pack of wipes for 3 bucks, tell her you figured with all the diapers she will be getting she may need something to wipe that baby up with too!     Also a pack of diapers can run you about 8 bukcs for the smaller pack.. you dont have to buy the 30 dollar box    and the best gifts i have gotten at my showers have been compilation gifts, like a little of this and a little of that... but for god sakes it is your brothers baby, as an auntie you will want to do more than diapers, if you can, right.... i know my sister buys a ton of stuff, and then brings mroe crap to the hospital once i have them...|`|PN7ELn3aaa	No, not rude at all. I think it is helpful for those who have no idea what to get her.|`|DNygQdmVaa	alot of people do it.  I don think its tacky or rude  it doesn mean you have to do it.|`|kQC4HX6vaa	Absolutely not.    She will definitely need diapers to change her baby...but of course the baby is going to need more than that, it'll need clothes, bottles, shoes, etc...      If you can't afford all that much, just bring in the diapers.    It's up to you how much help you want to give her.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	Just bring what you can afford (and wish to contribute).|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	its just a suggestion... not rude i dont think someone may disagree.   You dont have to do it they are just planting the thought i guess is all..|`|AA11294818	It can be considered rude and tacky. Take it for face value though. If you already got a gift, don't worry about it. I personally wouldn't get the diapers if I felt this way, either. It'll be no big deal.  It should be a fun time, so don't let the dumb invitations people send out and retarded expectations ruin that :)  I know exactly how you feel. There are people like that in our lives and I guess that's just how it is.|`|veO1RXrCaa	I don't know why people want to stock up on so many diapers.  I bought a box at costco and never used a quarter of them bc my son had a growth spurt.  I would rather buy them as I need them.  Kids grow fast and you may have too many of one size if you ask for something like this.  Wipes now those are something that she should have asked for.  Anyhow get her what you want too.  I wouldn't buy both.|`|3SIRKIBaaa	Well it's not rude. I think it was just a suggestion since she would definitely need a lot of diapers. But it doesn't mean that you have to do it. Just get her what you can. I'm sure no one would look at you differently if you walked in without it.|`|5X6C4s7zaa	Maybe that's for the wishing well.  I don't think that it's rude or tacky, just consider it as part of her gift.  If you really don't want to buy them than don't.|`|SrQlN7aNaa	Thats not rude at all! Sometimes the things on the registry are a bit expensive so you can opt to bring a pack of diapers. I found that getting lots of gift cards at the place i registered helped a lot. I went and got everything i needed, including diapers.|`|fVpRVofLaa	I think it's supposed to be humourous.|`|5nAWhEKRaa	How is that rude? She is not telling you to bye them their just asking. It sounds to me you just a little jealous. Diapers are not that much any ways I thank ill do that for my baby shower as well that is a good idea.|`|S3WeYrVgaa	Maybe a little tacky but not rude.  Personally if I was going to go to the baby shower she would either get something off the registry or a package of diapers but not both.  I have my own 2 kids to provide for so I'm not trying to be cheap.  Usually the registry should have diapers on it already so you guys know which brand is preferable to them.
Pf9fyEyQaa	It is very rare, the only way that would be possible is if one parent had the "bombay phenotype" which is a rare blood type ABO that presents itself as O.  It's most commonly found in places of incest.    Other than that it's impossible because in order to have O blood you need to be OO, where A blood can be AO or AA.  But if both are O then that's the only type of blood they can pass down.  If your dad was AO or AA than it would be possible, but not if he is truly OO (and not bombay).  If he is a bombay and doesn't know about it he should get checked because they can only be transfused with other bombay blood.  Good luck.    **You get your blood type as a COMBINATION of both parents.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  Blood types are A, B, AB, and O.      A can be AO or AA  B can be BO or BB  AB can only be AB  O can only be OO    If both parents have AO blood then they can have a child with either A or O blood, A if either parent passes down an A and O if both parents pass down a O.  If parents are AO and BO than they can have children with AO(a), AB, BO(b), or OO(o).    And paganmom is right about the Rh factor (+/-).  It is seperate from the ABO.    Here's a link about Bombay Phenotype: http://www.ualberta.ca/~pletendr/tm-modu...|`|nnBAnBOlaa	Someone could be wrong about their blood type.  It is genetically possible for 2 Rh+ parents to have an Rh- child.    Genetic makeup     Blood type      ++ . . . . . . . . . . . .Rh positive      +-  . . . . . . . . . . .  Rh positive      --  . . . . . . . . . . . . Rh Negative|`|67EaIAvbaa	uhh ohh...somebody's lying..bottom line.|`|uLeg1Aniaa	Its not possible.  Are they 100% sure that they are O positive?  Its possible that one of them isn't and thats where your A negative.    Edit:  Here is a website that I found that might help.  http://arcblood.redcross.org/new_site/bl...|`|jtjISk6qaa	your adopted or you have a different father.     you should recheck your blood type. we originally thought i was O but my dad is O and my mom is AB. turned out when i donated blood they told me i have A blood.    other people are saying that it doesnt matter if you have different blood but you DO inherit blood types from your parents.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	The Rh (+/-) factor is inherited separately from the ABO blood types. Similarly to the masking effect of the O gene in ABO blood types, the Rh negative (Rh-) gene is also masked by the presence of a Rh positive (Rh+) genotype. Therefore, a person may have a Rh + blood type and can still have an Rh - gene  Furthermore, 2 parents with Rh + blood types can have a child with Rh - blood type.      EDIT  hamrrfan- if you scroll down a little farther on the first link you provided you will see that two positives can make a negative...the information you provided is incorrect.  Two parents with a positive blood type can make a negatively bloodtyped child.|`|NNWerE4Jaa	you must have genes from your grand parents... or your mom had a affaire and your dad is not accually your dad...|`|vDcq64lqaa	It doesn't really matter what your parents are. I'm the only O negative person in my whole family.|`|AA10091300	you generally get your blood type from your father...you get one of the other...get rechecked have ur parents to get checked again and if the results are the same it could be that dad is not dad or your adopted.  and yes you do get your type from your parents...all those that said otherwise are wrong!
427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	If I'm counting right, he's nursing 8 times per day, correct?  That's perfect for his age, and it sounds like he's doing great.  Is he really sleeping 9 hours straight at night, too?  If so, that's pretty good sleeping for this age, and that's why he seems to be eating so often during the day.      Even if you decided to start solids now, they should be just for fun for the rest of the first year and shouldn't really replace breastmilk.  Until age 1, you should continue to nurse before offering solids so that he still gets all the milk he needs.    My oldest nursed every 2 hours during the day like clockwork until she was about 6 months old (and 1-2 times at night).  As she got older, she started sleeping longer stretches at night and giving me a longer stretch in the afternoon.  She was fully weaned at 14 months.    My middle child nursed about a million times a day (and night) until she was 2, and she's now a healthy 4-year-old who eats and sleeps well (most of the time  ;-)  ).  My youngest is 17 months old, and he nurses anywhere from 5-10 times per day/night as well as eating lots of solids.    Oh, and for what it's worth, I've always nursed my babies to sleep, and they've done just fine.  You have to do what works for you, and if your son falls asleep on his own, that's great, but don't feel like you're doing anything "wrong" by letting him fall asleep at the breast either.|`|2fwaAppKaa	hii im karla, and i as well have a 5 month old premiie ) correct age is 2 months) he turning 6 months soon, but wat i do is from all the breastmilk i had at the hospital i would put 1 tea spoon of formula as the hospital did and he sleept for 4 hrs str8... now wat im doind is breastmilk the tea spoon of formula and a lil bit of oat meal n he sleeps the whole night!!! he is not eating baby food as well... as ur baby primary doctor about it.. i think he ios good to start trying new things... my son eats vegies and fruits and loves it.. if u r willing to try it.. do it slow 1 fruit a week so u could noe if he is allergic to anything..|`|1d8d6dd1d24d25e868e243be80ec5711aa	Hi Kim, Im not sure if this will help, my daughter is 5 half months old, for about 3 weeks now my health visitor gave me a routine to try as I was giving regular milk feeds, and the odd baby rice with spoon.  Between 6am-7am Milk feed.  At 8.00am, when older child leaves for school, she has baby rice.  Around 12pm after morning nap, she has another milk feed.  Between 1-1.30 Lunch with me, baby veg.  Between 3-4pm Milk feed.  6pm dinner with family, baby veg.  Finally bedtime bath and milk around 7-7.30pm.  Last milk feed at 12 midnight.  After all that, she wakes sometimes in the night, but not for milk, just a little cuddle and dummy, then she goes back to sleep. Her 5 milk feeds ensure she gets her daily milk amount. This works for us very well, but as you know, you do have to be flexible. All baby's are different, but its nice to see other routines of baby's the same age. Good luck|`|yCwPxulYaa	My baby is 5 months old and still nurses every 2 hours or less.  I have only started oatmeal cereal once a day at night.  She still wakes up to nurse once, maybe twice at night.  I think that this is normal.  Keep doing what you are doing, it sounds like you have a great schedule.  Once you start solids, these times will start to strecth-out some.
V7Q7SbHfaa	I would say as soon as your baby has a little head control.  Tummy times helps the baby learn to hold their head up and build muscle.  I started when my daughter was a few weeks old, she could hold her head up very well by that time.  She is 7 months old and is now crawling.  They say to do tummy time a few times a day just for a few minutes at a time and work your way up to long periods of time.  Just do what you feel comfortable with, your baby will let you know when they are ready.  I am a first time mom to and all I did for the first few months was worry, so don't follow in my footsteps, enjoy your new baby and everything will fall into place.  Good luck!|`|FMpHtZnBaa	from newborn up until they start to walk and crawl to get the muscles strong.|`|067in9BMaa	I waited till my daughter was able to hold her head up for more than a few seconds. She could hold her head up at birth but not well or for very long. Plus 9 days old is still very young. I'm sure most of the time she is sleeping or eating. All she really needs right now is to grow and get lots of love and cudling. she's still new to the world and used to being warm and cozy in your belly. So I wouldn't push to do anything too soon. She just needs comfort and putting her on her belly makes her feel kinda insecure. but it's your baby so if you feel comfortable doing it now then do it. Like they say, mommy knows best:)|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	We started in the hospital with her laying on Daddy's tummy. Now at home she hates it, and she's 3 months. So we get her to do it about 5 minutes and she screams bloody murder...sigh...|`|0ca6f6ce6afa279f3ccc449197fd3d7daa	my dr. said you can start right away, just make sure you watch them closely and i would think it would be best to wait until their umbilical cord falls off|`|9de230e5b3f196d4083653e2703f4b13aa	I start in the hospital.   Good luck|`|snzlHgqraa	right away you can start tummy time! as long as you are right there with them.|`|R33f3Ff6aa	I started the first week and he is 6 months now and still loves tummy time!  He rolled over at 6 weeks and is now starting to crawl.  Mirrors and brightly colored stuffed toys seem to capture their interest most!|`|Y4DPDmrfaa	At least an hour everyday. You mean putting the newborn on the belly on the floor, right? Never put your baby on her belly when your not there though.|`|sUysQCxDaa	My pediatrician says that once the baby's umbilical stump falls off, I can start tummy time. It's never "too early" to start, but if the cord is still there, it could get irritated.|`|WU4ZWzIMaa	Hiya...I gave birth on jan 5th 09 and when I took my daughter to her 2 week check up she told me to make sure I give her tummy time everday if possible...that was 14 days old...but she said I could have started it sooner...I actually waited until her umbilical cord fell off, but since then she does it for about 15 or 20 mins daily...they don't do much and will look uncomfortable, but my dr said its only to prevent them from getting a flat spot on the back of there head...so its important to make sure they get just a little...when my daughter starts fussing, I pick her up..but word to wise...don't do it shortly after they eat...they tend to spit up bcuz of the pressure on the belly. And I actually bought a playmat with colors and toys and music so its funner for her..it has a little pillow that she can rest her head on so she isn't laying face to floor...I tilt her head to the side and she stays happy longer..with her arms stretched out in front of her. Have fun!|`|91f1a70e10014a34ca04f2d24c385427aa	they say right away- and as she gets older, you can put some pretty things in front of her to prompt her to lift her head up|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	I started in the hospital! I would lay my son on my chest and he'd lift his head to look at me.  And we just continued when we got home.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	As soon as the umbilical cord stump falls off.  And my advice is to start, and keep on it!  I had a really miserable start with my little girl, so of course when she was happy, I didn't want to ruin it with putting her on her tummy!  I'm now regretting it, because ,my little girl hates in now, and it is so important for their development!|`|qmslHwj3aa	Right away just make sure it is on a padded surface at first before they can hold their heads up.|`|DNygQdmVaa	right away.|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	my dr said 3 months, but I iknow people who try earlier|`|311bce43c0d6a6dc9442d046a8943886aa	anytime really, it gives them a break from being on their back, Just make sure they are supervised and not on their tummy for to long. My daughter is 3 months old and she doesn't like being on her tummy ( for some reason) lol..but its not to early, it will help strengthen then neck muscles a little as well..|`|LLNlyaFaaa	sorry i can't help you there but what is tummy time??|`|heDtLdz5aa	the day afte i had my son the doctors put him on his tummy to observe him...so tummy time anytime as long as you are close by....my son loved his tummy...
CiGVGhDZaa	it's possible.  count out seven days after the last day of your period and if you had sex at that point (typical ovulation) it is even more likely.  home tests come out - all the time when they should read +.  the best way to tell is to go to your doctor and ask for a blood test.  otherwise, wait until your period is a week late and take another test. the digital ones seem to work better than the old school ones.  good luck.|`|1CryEnb3aa	To know for sure, go get a blood test done.  If neg, then you relax and your period will come on.  If,pos, then you can plan accordingly.  You may be looking for every little thing too.  So , don't over analyze yet.  I hope this helps- Good luck|`|yRlIXECTaa	Sounds like you just have influenza (The flu)
DuLhv7Ajaa	Its not the fumes as some of the other answers have said, but its the chemicals on your scalp. Your head is very porous and absorbs a small amount of the chemicals in the dye.  If you really have to do something with your hair color, the safest thing would be to have a few high lights put in using a scull cap. This way you hair dresser can avoid any of the chemicals touching your scalp. But really you should hold off if you can, its always better to be safe with your baby than sorry.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	Most studies show that it is probably safe do to so because not enough chemicals are absorbed into your blood stream to do any damage as long as you are in a very well ventilated area.  If you chose to dye your hair you should wait until after the first trimester (about 3-4 months).  This info should help you:      http://www.babycenter.com/404_is-it-safe...    EDIT: a note to the ones saying the chemicals will hurt your baby.  There is not one study that conclusively says how these chemicals would hurt a fetus.  Though there are studies that show that a very high rate of exposure to these chemicals could have negative effects, the rates in those studies are much much higher than a woman would be exposed to.  Many professional salons have hair coloring that is safe and suitable for a pregnant women to use.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	yes the fumes will hurt you so bad... DONT DO IT haha|`|nzGdMWbZaa	Yes the chemicals will hurt your baby.|`|yJXX9kLqaa	Yes it can be bad for your baby. You inhale the fumes and that can get into your blood stream thus into your unborn child. You should try to wait until after birth (and longer if your breastfeeding)|`|VD4JgFnGaa	yes you could color your hair   its only the first 3months when they say you should not do it so girl you have to look your best do its and your baby will not be harm if any questions ask your dr|`|1Ec5Ntw7aa	I have heard yes it is.  It's bad to be around any chemicals that may harm the baby. :(|`|82ORY9UFaa	Use an amonia-free coloration, a coloration with amonia isnt recommended during pregnancy.|`|ii0C0tfXaa	After the first tri its safe. The chemicals are barely absorbed into your scalp, it will only hurt the baby if you color your hair about 100 times, and people can yell at me about this all they want, i did my research, and asked my doctor, and asked other doctors just to make sure it was safe, i colored mine 3 or 4 times during pregnancy...baby is fine!
n0WnEIopaa	I think you should do what you'd have fun doing.    If you enjoy making up goodie bags, then do it :)     If not, don't. Since they are family they won't care a wack.     You could plan the party with a craft making session involved, and the kids could bring their craft home.     Enjoy :)|`|nrQijvMuaa	No it's not I think the main purpose of a party is to have fun with family and enjoying looking at the kids have fun. I think goodies bad would be the least of worries. I think as long as there's cake which is the main ideal to sing Happy Birthday is all that Counts. Happy Birthday 2 your tiny tot!!|`|6IEpZkAcaa	no its not tacky and if you wanna keep it low key you should maybe do a pinyata or shomthing easy for the little one you know?? .......GOOD LUCK!!!   =D|`|f3JUERf5aa	I didn't feel like doing goody bags one time so I went to the dollar store bought some toys and stuff made a goody box that they could pick out of on their way out the door... make the stuff age friendly and you should be set...
yNbGq4viaa	The week in the middle of your cycle (usually 1.5 to 2 weeks after your period) is your most fertile if you are generally regular.  If you will check your temperature it will be slightly higher than normal when you are ovulating.  Remember, semen can live inside the body for up to three days so if you have intercourse at least twice during this week it will give you a higher chance of conception.  I recommend once at the beginning and once about midway through the week.  Most of all, you have to RELAX.  Many who have had trouble conceiving have tried for years and when they finally "gave up" or relaxed about it, BOOM!  Pregnant.  Good luck!|`|Nb413oN5aa	Every Sunday have him eat a can of Geisha Oysters, not oyster pieces, not smoked oysters. I like to make them in an omelet with some vegetables. I find them tasty. oysters are said to be a great nutritional aid to sperm. Good luck and most important have FUN!|`|BrWVBIE4aa	just go into the doctors and get artificial insemanation done...other than that you can figue out the lunar days go by that|`|1d4f066127a4debbe9480a24c479ac16aa	The times to conceive are before your period not after.The week before your period is the best and I was also told that a women who climaxes during sex has a better chance on conceiving.One friend who do head stands to improve her chances.Just relax and enjoy your spouse that seems to be the best way to get pregnant.When people worry about all this stuff stress becomes the number one reason why you can't get pregnant and the other is enjoying your spouse too much can be another factor.|`|NNwEuC8paa	Do it every other day if you can! That's the best thing to do.|`|2HETgiwgaa	You need to know your cycle length to estimate when you might ovulate - so can't tell from your question.  But, I'm a real convert to charting - lets you work out your "fertile window" (the few days each month when you are most likely to conceive - the few days leading up to and of ovulation).  I use fertilityfriend.com - but I've also seen a recommendation for mymonthlycycles.com.      The main thing you need is a BBT (basal body temperature) thermometer.  Charting your temp first thing when you wake up lets you see when ovulation has passed (three high temps in a row - ovulation is likely to have been the day before your temps went up).  There are also OPK (ovulation predictor kits) you can use to test for a surge of the hormone that causes you to ovulate.  If you want to try these - shop around as they can be expensive - buying online may be the cheapest way (depending on what's available where you live). OPKs help you know beforehand when you are going to ovulate - but they're not essential as there other physical things that signal ovulation (eg CM - cervical mucous).      Good luck and BABY DUST :-)|`|U49FhI05aa	U shud have sex for atleast alternate days up to 12   days from now.1 week before your period u will be no more    fertile.So try in these days. Bcoz in these 12   days u will ovulate which will help for better conceving.Good luck.|`|1dOFZC82aa	when you're trying to conceive you should have sex about 3 times a week, and then when you are most fertile (when your cervical mucous is abundant, and clear like water, and stretchy like egg whites) you should make sure you have sex at least every other day, or everyday if your hubby's sperm count is good.  I can't tell you the exact dates that you should have sex, but you will ovulate around two weeks after the first day of your period, but it can be later or earlier depending on the woman.    Check out fertilityfriend.com for more tips on conceiving.    Good luck!|`|Tk1QJJsZaa	what is your Length of cycle? lets say if your LOC is 28 days.  then these are the days you guys should try to have intercourse:  1/25/09 - First day of your cycle  2/05/09 - A little bit fertile  2/06/09 - Fertile  2/07/09 - VERY fertile  2/08/09 - Time to ovulate  for more info google it "Ovulation Calendar - Plan the best times to get pregnant"  gud luck!!!
FgAPXhVRaa	It is very normal, and even when you feel prepared you will have doubts because having a baby is such a responsibility. If I were you though I would finish school first. I am sure that if you are going to law school, you would like to get to practice law for a bit until having a baby. Take your time... there is no rush!!!|`|dPULl5hjaa	So much drama.    Finish college, get a job, save money then get married and have kids.    What's the hurry?|`|XCueIYnYaa	It is certainly normal, you want to be ready mentally physically and economically. I have a friend who also keeps going back and forth. Shes been married for 2 years now. its normal  Wait til you are totally ready.|`|veO1RXrCaa	Well honey I must be old having kids being that Im 32 and working on  2.  But we waited until the time was right.  Emotionally/physically and Financially.  I wanted one all the time.  I would tell him that we should have a baby and then realize that the time isn't right.  Even when it was the right time and he was ready I was still unsure.  But I got over my issues and now Im due in March.  Anyhow it's best to be financially sure whats going on before having a baby anyhow.  They are way more expensive then you can imagine.  Even with  2 and having things bought already Im (not my husband oddly) am shocked at the price of things.|`|MtC3CWZraa	My old boss' wife is an attorney and having a baby a couple of years ago doesn't seem to have affected her career.    I personally think it would be very tough to manage law school and parenting. Little kids suck up a ton of your time. If I were you, I'd get through school, land a job, and then worry about kids.     I worked and went to college full time and every single day I was greatful that I wasn't also trying to take care of a kid! I couldn't have done it. I barely had time for myself and my relationship back then.  My husband and I agreed on a long term plan: we graduated, got married, bought a house and then worked on starting a family.|`|dRd5d6Bgaa	Girl...I think you should wait to have a baby. It sounds like you're busy as it is. If you're a junior in college and after you graduated, you're planning on going to Law School and then working at a law firm. Get your education first. If you put a baby into that mixture now, you'll get side-tracked and won't be able to do what you want in the next several years. Understandably, having a child is an amazing thing...no doubts, but if you have your life ahead of you and you know what you want...don't be dumb and throw it away. You'd be throwing it all away if you get pregnant now and have a child, you'll be completely side-tracked. Take it from somenone who's been there and done that (me).|`|xue72D76aa	It is 100% normal to debate the timing of having kids, especially if you're planning for a career.  Ultimately, no matter what happens or when, you will make it work.  Look at all of the people who got pregnant accidentally and things worked out fine for them.  You have to do what is best for your family, all things considered.|`|9vgZNLP8aa	It's perfectly normal. I also think it's great that you are taking time to think things through before you decide to have children. There is nothing wrong with waiting a few more years to get through your schooling first.|`|PwmBdiEfaa	I think it is normal in life to question every decision that has to be made...it is responsible of you to weigh the pros and cons. But if you are wanting such a demanding career, I might suggest holding off until you are better established. School and career do take a lot of time, and you may not be able to dedicate the time and love that your child is going to need.   BUT....maybe your boyfriend wouldn't mind being the more prominent parent...maybe he will put his career on hold for awhile. In that case, it may work in your benefit to have one now.|`|FAQldsUZaa	Well if you keep having debates on rather or not to have children, I think you should wait. You didnt mention how old you were, but I know at least younger then 22. Your still in college... finish that before you have a baby. It will be extremely hard to finish law school w/ a newborn!!|`|627pWyVkaa	if you have doubts ever then dont do it because once you are, you cant really change it! Do it when you feel comfortable and if you have a lot on your plate now, It will be a lot harder while pregnant. Id finish school then re evaluate if you have less doubts then.|`|488edafbffd854a7df677efa90768cabaa	Of course it's normal. Especially when you have so much else to do. First of all, ask yourself why you want to have children at so young an age. I was in my thirties when I had mine and I am so grateful I waited. I am a much better mother now than I would have been earlier. Second, ask yourself if you would want to be the child you're having. You won't have much time for the baby, nor will you have much money to take care of the necessities much less the baby's wants. Believe me, by the time they're two or three, they start asking for things. It really starts to break your heart to have to say no to almost everything because you just don't have the money.   And here's the thing. Once the baby is here, your chances of actually finishing law school and having a career as a lawyer go down dramatically.  It is so much harder than you know.   Regardless of the decision you make there is one thing you must do first. Marry your boyfriend. If you two aren't willing to make a lifetime commitment to each other, you have no business bringing a child into the world that will tie you together for life.|`|joPJtKemaa	I agree with Answer  1    Get a degree, a good job and then have a baby.|`|tSvSwOZRaa	It is normail to go back and forth. I was pregnent and felt the same way.... the "Am I ready?" will always be there. You will never have "enough" money, "enough" space, "enough" anything... if everyone waitied till after College and had a career to have kids, most of us would not be here. Just make sure you are in a good relationship and you are mentally sound to have kids. (Getting married is a good idea too), just makes things a bit more stable for  the kids. Good Luck!

Don't be worried about "if I don't wear it they won't like me." If they're really that shallow then it's not worth being their friends.

But it is normal for teething to start at any time between 3 months and 12 months of age. By the time your child is about 3 years old, he or she will have all 20 primary teeth.   The lower front teeth usually come in first. Upper front teeth usually come in 1 to 2 months after the lower front teeth    What are the symptoms?  Some babies are fussier than usual when they are teething. This may be because of soreness and swelling in the gums before a tooth comes through. These symptoms usually begin about 3 to 5 days before the tooth shows, and they disappear as soon as the tooth breaks the skin. Other babies don't seem to be affected by teething.  Babies may bite on their fingers or toys to help relieve the pressure in their gums. They may also refuse to eat and drink because their mouths hurt.   Many babies drool during teething, which can cause a rash on the chin, face, or chest.   Some parents report a low fever of 100.4(38) to 102(39), diarrhea, and ear pulling during teething. Mild symptoms that get better usually are nothing to worry about. Call your doctor if your babys symptoms are severe or don't get better.  How can I help my baby be more comfortable while teething?  Here are some tips to help your baby feel better while teething:  Give your baby a mild pain reliever that is labeled for his or her specific age. For example, acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Advil) may help relieve your baby's discomfort. Do not give aspirin to anyone younger than 20, because it has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare but serious disease.   Use a clean finger (or cold teething ring) to gently rub your baby's gum for about 2 minutes at a time. Many babies find this soothing, although they may protest at first.   Provide safe objects for your baby to chew on, such as teething rings.   Many parents use other teething remedies, such as gels you put on a babys gums. Some experts question if these work and are safe. If you want to try these products, talk to your doctor about which types are safe and how often to use them.|`|60750f49cc3788b9181c80f4fd378d36aa	every baby is different some start at 2 months|`|6461f94a65606d408b408e32134c7671aa	my nephew started teething at 2 months it is normal don't worry!!|`|7ccf31420ae3319d43b8406ffdc5f7daaa	my daughter's doctor said the same thing and i switched to a diff doctor.

His tooth might pop through tomorrow or you might not see it for another 3 or 4 months or more.  Try some of those teethers you put in the freezer and see if that gives him any relief.

Natashal|`|80f71bedf1e3694b7cfb5720c8ffc682aa	Both my brother and my niece were born with teeth. Babies can start teething at any age, just depends on the individual. My sister used the baby Tylenol syringe and put the (recommended) dosage in it and let my niece chew on it. The chewing helps the pain and the baby is also getting the Tylenol. You could also try teething rings you put in the freezer or baby Orajel to put on their gums. Good luck!|`|AA11018795	I took my baby in to the pediatrician at 2 1/2 months for the EXACT same things.  I mentioned teething, and the doc said, no way.  A month later I was back, with the same symptoms (they wanted to check for an ear infection).  I said, again, that I thought she was teething.  Not possible, I was told.  Two weeks later (3 days before she turned 4 months old) she had her first tooth, and the next was 2 weeks after that.  If it's not an ear infection, I'd be willing to be he's teething.  Some babies teeth for quite a while before one breaks through, and others have it happen seemingly overnight.  She's five months old today, and working on her next two teeth (my poor fingers!!!).    Good luck.  :-)|`|c1ea4feef364d664bac31feeb243265baa	Babies can start teething at 3 weeks old..

This could be what is going on with your baby.     It certainly sounds if he is starting to teeth, but you may find you have to put up with the symptoms for ages yet.    My kids have just spent the last 8 months getting their last big back teeth, they started teething at 6 months and are now 2 yrs and 10 months and just about finished.

Have you been under a lot of stress lately? Either in your personal life or at work... I would personally wait until I was about 2 weeks late, and try the test again. So far as I know (and I may be very wrong about this), pregnancy is only going to be detected in the dr's office if they specifically test for it. I don't think the STD and blood pressure tests would show it. Although every pregnancy is different, most pregnancies don't show many symptoms until you're at least 2 months along, if not further. I've been told this is especially true with your first pregnancy. Like I said, I would wait at least another week, try the test again, and if it's still negative, make an appointment with your gynecologist. Some women just don't have high enough levels of the protein (or whatever is tested in urine) for it to register on the urine tests.

EeGgovyCaa	I'm in the same boat. CIO is not an option for me either and I get so tired and frustrated with getting up all through the night to give her a binkie. So lately what I've been doing that's kinda helpful is putting her in a pack n play next to my bed. So she's near me but not on my bed. I'm hoping this can slowly start teaching herself to fall asleep. It's worked for two nights in a row so far. |`|1886d90ec70dd5c091ff5046d0eb40edaa	There is a book called Babywise that teaches you how to get the Baby on a routine.

I had to put my daughter in her crib b/c I would hear her wiggling around or feel her wiggling and mistake it for her waking up when really if I didn't make eye contact with her she went right back to bed.  Now she only gets up 1 time between 3 and 5am and then doesn't get up again until 7:30am.  When she does wake, she plays in her crib until 8am - I can finally blowdry my hair again LOL!|`|Ngny2jrCaa	Play with her about 3 hours before putting her to bed - before you.  You MUST NOT go to bed at the same time as your daughter.  After playing and tiring her, give her a warm bath, make sure she is well wrapped and put her to sleep with a lavender pillow around or spray some lavender on her bed.  She will cry the first few times, there is no way to scape that, you create a bad habit and now it needs time to substitute.|`|nkkPOIeiaa	The best advise I would give, is during the day make sure your child tires herself out. Before you all go to bed, give her a nice warm bath with the bedtime baby wash and put her to sleep. wait until you think she is deep in her sleep then attempt to move her. Make sure she is confortable. Keep the pacci close by. When and if she wakes up, go lay beside her and when she goes back to sleep ease away. She will eventuall get used to sleeping by herself. My daughter is 17 months and she still wakes up in the mid of the night, we just keep a cold sippy cup of milk on stand by. Just try it and see...
27c8211f39ef186ce6ff9178afb86ed7aa	Heh.. Well, I didn't know I was pregnant. Nope, dead serious. Didn't know. Here's my story (I'll copy and paste from my myspace page, because, frankly, it's really freaking long):    I have lupus.  I'm, more or less, seemingly always sick. I wake up in the morning, and I feel like I'm 80 years old, because my knees and back hurt. I get randomly nauseous, and have to have pee tests done monthly to make sure my kidneys aren't failing. So I'm basically a mess.  I'd also been on birth control for the last five years. The Depo Provera shot. Never missed a shot, never late. Always went religiously every eleven weeks.    So, how did I end up with a baby? Well, the only guess we have is that my body built up an immunity to the hormones. At least, that's what the doctor seems to think. I, personally, think that God got tired of me having sex and not being married, and He decided to teach me a lesson.    Angie was born on March 4th. I woke up that morning, thinking that I had food poisoning or something from undercooked chicken from the previous night. First thing I did was throw up. Then I started cramping and having some serious diarrhea at nine that morning. As the day wore on, the cramping just got worse. Joey came home from work at around 8:15 that night, and I told him he had to make his own dinner; I just wasn't up to it. About 8:45, the pain just got too bad, and I knew something was wrong. I called out to him and told him something wasn't right, that we had to get to the hospital because I felt like I was splitting apart in two.    So Joey starts freaking out - he thinks there's something going on with my lupus, that maybe I'm having organ failure or something. So he asks me if he should call for an ambulance... Now, we lived about two and a half blocks from the hospital. Ok, maybe more like four. But still. It was a five minute drive. I looked at him like he had three heads, and told him that was a stupid idea.    I was wrong. The stupid idea was letting him drive me to the hospital. He got so mad at the traffic in front of us (all of three cars), and he drove like an idiot. I would've been safer in the ambulance.    But alas. We made it to the hospital in one piece. He parks under the big sign that said "EMERGENCY" thinking it was, well, the emergency room entrance. It wasn't. It was the main entrance.  He runs in, and the lobby is completely abandoned. There's no one there. He starts yelling out for anyone, and a security guard comes out. He tells the security guard there's something wrong with me (I'm still trying to get out of the car at this point..), and that he needed help. The guard handed him a wheelchair, which Joey promptly ran outside with. Jumped a curb, came *thisclose* to getting run over by another car, and almost crashed into his own car. I got out of the car and sat in the wheelchair. In the time it took me to get out, the security guard came out and took over pushing me into the ER. I think he was afraid Joey would end up killing me on the way in. In the meantime, he tells Joey to park his car.    In the ER, I have to ring for help; there's no one there. So someone comes out, and I tell them where I hurt. They ask how often the pains are coming together, and I told them it was every minute or so. They ask me if my water broke. What?! What water?    In the meantime, while I'm in transit, Joey comes to the ER and asks where I was. Their response? "They're taking her up to maternity." Joey - "Why?" thinking maybe they didn't have any more room in the hospital or something. Them - "Well, we don't deliver babies in the ER." Joey - "That's nice - what's wrong with her?"    So I'm up on this strange floor, and they help me up onto this table thing. And they start pulling my clothes off of me. Then they strapped this thing onto my stomach. "Yep, that's a heartbeat - and it ain't yours." Me - "You mean a baby?! No, you're wrong - look again!" Next thing I know, they have me lying on this table thing with my legs in the air while this nurse comes up and just sticks her fingers in my hoohah. Now come on - at least let me know what you guys are doing! Says something about me being 8 centimeters and she can feel the head. At this point, I've come to terms with this. Ok, I'm not dying - I'm just having a baby. Now get me some pain medicine!    Then they stuck this hook thing up in me and broke my water for me, which just increased the pain tenfold. At this point, I'm begging the doctor for pain meds. "Nope, it's too late - sorry! If you'd just push, you'd get this over and done with quicker!" And then he left the room.    In the meantime, Joey, who has anxiety problems to begin with, is looking white as a ghost and shaking like a leaf. I send him out of the room, telling him they'll get him when it's time.    Anyway, the pain got worse and worse. The nurses kept telling me I had to push. Then I felt like I had to poop. And then some serious pain, and out popped a baby. Ta-da!! They put her on my stomach, and I pulled my hands back and looked at her like she was an alien - she looked gross at that point, anyway. Besides, that totally didn't come out of me! At that point, the doctor gave me morphine. Why?! It didn't hurt anymore. And that's when he decided to go fishing. He stuck his hand up inside me and tried to pry the afterbirth loose. In the meantime, he's telling me to stay still and not move. But he was doing something, because his hand hurt more than having the kid did. So they sent me up to surgery, because I chose not to cooperate.    So, Angie was born at 9:58 that night. You think I waited long enough to go to the hospital? :-P"|`|bWu4p5OBaa	When i got my epiderul my husband was asked if he could handle it and of course being the macho farmer boy he is he said sure I will be. I help cows give birth all the time i needle them and breed them I've seen some pretty gross stuff I'll be fine. He passed out and the nurses cuaght him he started gagging and drooling in my croch which is where his head landed right as I was having a  contraction hw was out for a good 5 minutes. He was pale for three days and he slept through the rest of my labor b/c he felt so sick! He made up for it when she was born b/c he was a fantastic help when I was recovering. But yeah it's a fun story to tell his other macho farm friends. |`|EeGgovyCaa	It's not really haha funny, but when people asked me what made me think I'm about to deliver. I said because I "thought" my water broke. Well if your water didn't actually break then what else would make you think that?    Yep, I peed my pants! and I thought my water had broke so we went to hospital where of course we found out my water didn't break. I just peed. so embarrassing.|`|1886d90ec70dd5c091ff5046d0eb40edaa	I wanted to have a July 4th baby but that day came and went. I loved being pregnant but it was starting to get very tiring. I had to get up every hour or so at night and pee because the baby felt like her head was squeezing my bladder. I had started having incontinence that last week. I could not sneeze or laugh without having to change my underwear.     I woke up on a Saturday morning and felt the incontinence had been worse, so I put an adult diaper on and went shopping with my husband. I heard walking could get labor started so I did a few laps around the store. Later that night, I thought I kept peeing myself. As long as I stayed seated, I could control it and as soon as I stood up, a little would leak. It turns out my water had broke! This was my first child and I always thought water breaking would be a huge gush and not a small leak. I also thought contractions would come first. I was in labor 13 hours and did not even know it!|`|fe77ff5fa44c4cf94af93d4818e67426aa	well I was in labour for about 18 hours already, and finally got an epidural, because I was so tired and just done with the pain.  The nurses would always come in before hand and ask me on a scale of 1-10 what was my pain level. 10 being the most unbearable.   After I got my epidural and it kicked in, the nurse came into the room and asked me the 1-10 scale. (I don't remember this part, my mom told me later) I turned over to the nurse and said "it's a 1... hahahahaha ******* eh"  The nurses started laughing as well.|`|PtdijzfRaa	My oldest was born two weeks before Christmas. We were at dinner at his parent's house and we were just hanging out. I had been having braxton-hicks for like a week, so I didn't think much of the contractions I was having! We were all eating dinner when I felt a pop...and my water broke. I remember my husband going "Honey, please tell me there is a good reason that my shoe is wet...". And when I made the mistake of saying "I think my water broke babe" the whole room started freaking out.     Calmy I told everyone to SHUT UP and told my husband to get the car ready. In the car I started to feel really bad pressure. It was a good fifteen minute drive to the hospital, but there was quite a bit of traffic it took about twenty-five minutes.    We were about five minutes away when I started to say I needed to push and my husband was saying not in my car! haha. We probably looked like idiots!    By the time I got to the hospital, Kendell's head was between my legs. She was born IN THE ELEVATOR on the way upstairs, and my husband PASSED OUT! So when the elevator doors opened, the scene had to be hysterical! My husband slumped over, passed out and then me holding this baby, pants off, umbilical cord still attached.    Oh good times :).|`|TuPUCKZtaa	For me it was arguing with the nurse trying to convince her I needed to push. I went into labor 2 months early and not one nurse or such thought I would deliver that day. My water had broken and I sure felt like I was but it was back labor so not on their machines. I was checked at 2pm and was 7 cm. I had an epidural shortly after because of a pinched nerve. At 5:30 pm I told them I was uncomfortable and feeling pressure. They told me it was contractions that's all. At 6 pm I told them I needed to push- no just a contraction I was told. Because of the epidural they were putting a catheter in at this time. My husband asked when was the next time I would be checked- she said 10 pm! I said I still feel like pushing- no dear she said. My husband said check her while you are doing that- but not so politely-lol Next thing I hear is oh my! I guess you do have to push the nurse said. Well no kidding! She then said it would be a couple hours still and left for ten minutes. When she came back she checked and could see the top part of her head! She rushed me down the hall to the delivery room yelling for a dr as she went. My husband realized no one heard and went to the desk so they could call someone. Boy did they ever get busy but the doctor who delivered my girl at 6:36 pm didn't get there until just a few minutes before her birth! They should have believed me-lol but it all worked out in the end.
ev8ZZYx2aa	Swollen breasts are present during the first week of life in many female and male babies. They are caused by the passage of female hormones across the mother's placenta. Sometimes the breast will leak a few drops of milk, and this is normal. Breasts are generally swollen for 2 to 4 weeks, but they may stay swollen longer in breast-fed and female babies. One breast may lose its swelling before the other one by a month or more. Never squeeze the breast because this can cause infection. Be sure to call your health care provider if a swollen breast develops any redness, streaking, or tenderness. |`|E0gm0mRBaa	some children develop a condition, i can't remember what it's called but you will need to take her for further tests. i know a 6 month old with pubic hair because of this condition. don't stress over it as it won't help anything but just be aware that there are conditions that can cause this but it's not dangerous or anything, she'll be fine.|`|epuyOMxzaa	I would say just keep an eye on them in case they turn pink/red.  It might be mastitis especially if you are breastfeeding.  If the swelling doesn't go down in a few days though, it might be a good idea to get her checked out just in case.  Better safe than sorry!|`|AA11625299	It is normal, I read it can last up to 4 weeks, its particularly common in breastfed babies, it can happen to boy or girl, it is caused by the passage  of the mothers estrogen across the placenta|`|5xSL3NtBaa	I was just reading about this in "What to Expect the First Year". It says that boys and girl babies can get this. They can even leak from their breasts because all the hormones that get passed to you. So it's normal. |`|20bGyp4Taa	This is not normal at all. Your daughter needs to get some medical attention straight away.     Sometimes this can be caused by infected lympnodes/glands.    Please take your daughter back and get checked again, or see another pediatrician. |`|NZNWaC1Faa	Any irregular findings on a child should be medically attended to , take your baby to a specialist, oor hospital. So much is going on now day's.
3G0hx0mfaa	First you need to see if the reason you split up could affect the baby (e.g was he violent etc) If not then he has a right to know about the baby. Before you tell him you ned to decide how much you want him involved with both the pregnancy birth and the baby, you need to set him clear (but reasonable) guidelines that he must adhere to. Face to face would be better, but if you are scared you will forget all you need to say maybe you should write a letter, hand that to him face to face and tell him in the letter that you will meet him in a few days  (after he has had time to cool off and sort himself out) at a location of your choice.|`|XzSsclTbaa	if u dont want him back u can always tell him face to face that ur pregnant with his baby...make him pay for child support...b careful..|`|ZMUal5uIaa	Well don't do it though a text for God's sake!  Would YOU believe anything sent though a text???  No, more than likely you wouldn't.    A child is the largest and hardest responsibility anyone will ever face in their lifetime and both of you need to sit down together, face to face and discuss.|`|3F8f1SoQaa	" guess what? last time you came for a booty call disgused as a make-up attempt you forgot to wear a condom. I found out that I am pregnant with your baby" "I don't want you back, but you are welcome to see your baby since you will be paying child support for the next 18 years"|`|NZNWaC1Faa	tell him he's going to be a dad|`|Ylrc1hkXaa	You might want to tell him whether or not you intend to have his child and if so how you're going to make sure he can play an active role in its life    
1886d90ec70dd5c091ff5046d0eb40edaa	I was 29 when I started thinking about it- then we tried for almost two years to get pregnant and I finally had a baby girl. I am glad I waited because I got all the 20's partying out of my system and waited until I found my soul mate. It is a lot of work, though it is worth it. I just don't think I could have been as good of a mom when I was younger.|`|YCICrIKyaa	I was 12 when I wanted a baby. That year I ended up living with a family that already had 3 kids, 18 months, 2 years, and 4 years old. I quit a semester of school to watch them during the day until I had to move out. I'm 23 now and 15 weeks pregnant. I'm very happy with my choice but I have to tell ya, I'm in pain right now really bad in my right buttox cheek and my hip. It's awful! I am one of those people who are having a bad pregnancy. I am working and staying stable but I have had the worst 15 weeks ever. When your time comes, I hope you have better luck!!|`|gkjM9a4Maa	depends on the person, i am 24 and i still don't want kids|`|TlA2z5XJaa	Sounds normal to me. It started for me when I was 18 and my friend had a baby boy, thats when I became a little clucky, before that I didn't even like children or feel any desire to have them. Be careful, once that cluckiness sets in I reckon you are more prone to accidental pregnancy! I ended up pregnant shortly before my 20th birthday, and although I was excited at the thought of having a baby, I didn't think it would actually happen!! |`|XjHuGaxLaa	Some people just don't have the urge to have babies,  I'm seventeen and I'd love a baby, I guess because I've been around them so much.|`|njTzEF9caa	Kids teach you what others can't. Take it from me, I am a mother of four beautiful children and life is so much fun with them. But it is alot of work. God gives you life when you are ready, and when and if it happens remember its a gift, and gifts are made to treasure.  |`|GbGrS9YBaa	For me, since i was fourteen. I had a baby at sixteen, so, i suppose my thoughts couldn't subside.|`|ZMIVVLAtaa	people often comment that dreams are not what they seem. baby in dreams may signify new beginnings. especially some that may be really really scary but super excited and nervous like a baby. or it may mean sometime like innocence. maybe something that you are trying to may question innocence or an action that may not be innocent when you think it is. there are many possibilities. but i do not think there is an age when women start thinking about babies.     or maybe someone may be pregnant or just had a kid and deep down in inside you may want one even if you think you dont.     i would see to note them, in a journal and see if daily activities may cause it. if you want    but no worries and dont obsess over it. dreams are dreams, who really knows what they mean!?!?!    confused, just take it lightly    but overall if you do not see yourself having a child with ur boyfriend and might want a child... you may want to beginning looking for someone who you would like to have a family with and live with for the rest of your life.     good luck
OwisQwA9aa	now is good use your child as your tool|`|YJC5tl8Vaa	U can go for a walk but if ur breastfeeding u should only start to workout vigorously when the baby is 2 months because by then ur milk production is good and the workout shouldnt affect ur milk.  But yeah walking is great too.|`|X6as2nOAaa	You can start workling out if you feel up to it just don't over do it and everything will be fine.|`|WIdhBSimaa	4 MONTHS
uCLenopbaa	that is big.. but some babies are just bigger than others.  my son is small. he is almost 3 months and just barley over 10 pounds. babies, just like adults come in all shapes and sizes. unless his doctor is concerned, don't be worried.  and i don't think putting him on formula is going to change anything..|`|SjX72fPyaa	My daughter was 10 lbs when she was 3 months old.|`|ed72c617bb10153eb98393db9edf6b5aaa	17lbs is good
1YHih8wyaa	i gave her a tiny bit of water since she was a month old. by the time she was 6 months old i was giving her around 4 oz of water a day. at 4 months i started with oatmeal cereal because rice constipated her too bad. I also started her her on prune juice at this time to help with the transition. once you introduce, new milk, food, etc to a baby their vowel movements can change and so the prune, pear, grape and apple juices really help. gave her the cereal for a week. then i moved on to veggie gerbers and by 6 months i was giving her fruit and veggie gerbers, chicken broth and potatoes, and cereal and by 7 months i went to buy those little mesh bags that come with a holder and i was putting whole fruits in there for my daughter and she was eating things on her own. i also introduced the sippy cup at that time. i would only give her water and juice in her sippy cup. she is now 1 year old and she eats anything and everything she can get in her mouth. granted i do try to make things as mushy as possible so she doesnt choke. she loves mushy stuff like lentil, peas, and bean soup.   i am thinking that i will try and take the bottle away in the next few months. i plan on putting juice and water in her bottle and only milk in her sippy cup. see if she handles that ok.|`|hNa5oHxQaa	age 2|`|p9YrK5cMaa	water n rice cereal at 4 1/2 months|`|ed72c617bb10153eb98393db9edf6b5aaa	baby cereal at 4mnths but she really didn't eat consistantly until 5mnths.

75oU12V3aa	Your body is going through a lot at the moment getting used to the baby growing inside. It is a foreign object and your body could be reacting to it with the upset stomach.  Headaches are normal too, I got migraines frequently in my first trimester. This is due to the extreme amount of hormones coursing through your veins.    Just stick it out, it does get better!    Good luck!!!|`|LKIhUMCgaa	it's not morning sickness, it's just simply diarrhea, which is normal during first trimester. the headaches are also another symptom of pregnancy, just take some extra strength tylenol, should be gone in no time.    i never actually threw up, did feel a little nauseous though, had diarrhea, peed a lot, headaches, nosebleeds (more of bloody mucus when i blow my nose, which now i'm 27 weeks pregnant and still have lol), cramps, weird watery discharges, pain in the ribs, back aches, tiredness...all pregnancy symptoms and all normal.|`|vGCEFrhuaa	I think it's time for a shower.|`|NTK4XLuDaa	I had the same for both of my pregnancy, it's just the hormones ( you'll hear that excuse for a lot of ailments during pregnancy : ) ) I also chronic tiredness with my first from 6 Weeks and slept for 17 hours a day for around 3 - 4 weeks.|`|HEb9nQeFaa	Morning sickness.

T4tGAch4aa	I thought I had the flu but about a week ago I found out I am pregnant. But it could be different for you. Just take a pregnancy test in two weeks that is all you can do really.|`|CP1zxDLiaa	I am in week 10 and just started to get morning sickness last week(week 9). I have known some people to get it within days of a missed period though. Everyone is different.     And it isn't always an everyday occurrence. Yesterday I got it twice, today I didn't get it at all. And by no means is it limited to only the morning.     Take a pregnancy test when you miss your period to see if you are pregnant or if you are just experiencing the flu.     Best of luck!|`|okfTDJ7taa	hmm within the first trimester...1-3 mos after conception i would imagine...and it all depends on the person|`|xGI9z01Maa	Usually 2 weeks but each women is different.  I did not have morning sickness.  I only got sick when I had cherry flavor items with my first, the smell of bacon and my brothers drive with my second, and nothing with my third.    A lot of women mistake the beginning of pregnancy with the flu but take an over the counter test if you don't have your period on time or 3 to 4 weeks after intercourse if you don't have a normal cycle.  This is a better way to be sure that you just had the flu.     You may have just had a bit of bad food.  But don't drink any beers or hard liquor until your sure.  It is bad for the baby if you are in the first three months when you are least likely to know that you are pregnant
OlPwUM8aaa	At this age you are probably the epitome of cool. She will want to be just like you so be a good example. 7 yr old girls love to have coloring competitons do arts and craft with toillete paper rolls make jewelley with buttons macaroni you can color them with markers or paint. If you or your parents have old clothes you can play dressup or put a liitle make up on her let her put some on you.play with each others hair paint toenails finger nails etc.  Have fun ladies|`|xRiQUZt5aa	Coloring is a great idea.  Read books to her.  Play an easy board game with her.  Buy some Play-doh and play that.  Do crafts.  Have her run around outside - bike riding, hopscotch, etc.  Just talk to her! Ask her about her life and what she likes. That may give you an indication of what she would like to do.|`|d43e96506445ef1b6b4ace4380a9a5b4aa	crafts are great. making jewelry especially. when my daughter was that age she loved doing anything with crafts. even if it was taking household items and turning them into something creative.     http://www.mommytips.com/mt/Kids/Family_...|`|wX5xoAN8aa	Print out some coloring sheets, play with your pet ( if you have one), you could rent a movie and get some popcorn...

1aef7f995f51febd8766800476091cb4aa	wear a bikini... i did ... but scrap the water slides. to dangerous. what if u fall on ur belly. just float on the lazy river :)|`|WPI0Z47saa	I think the slide may be a bit too much for the baby. They may not even let you on. I know at Sesame place there that is one of the no riding rules. Hot tubs are fine if you just want to put your feet in but you are right, you can't submerge yourself and raise your body temperature. The river ride will probably be the most you can do besides sit in a pool. It could still be fun. Hey it is a day out right? I would go with a one piece only because some people are very cruel and you may get nasty comments. If you are the type that doesn't care what people say then go for the two piece if that is what you like. Have fun!|`|4cprznZcaa	i wish that it was warm enough here to go to a water park, its about 12 degrees! i wouldnt risk the slides, but the lazy river and regular pool will be fine. also.. wear your bikini! if i were pregnant in the summer i would definitely show off my belly! have fun|`|qFvHH6lUaa	Definitely do not do the hot tub.  And I think that the water slides would be too risky.  If the river float is a calm ride down the river, you could do that one.      For bathing suits, some women are perfectly comfortable wearing a two piece, some are not.  It depends on how comfortable you feel.  I was never that ok.  I'd have worn a 1 piece with a t-shirt over top.  But if you're ok with it and your boyfriend is ok with it, go for the 2 piece.|`|52U22fiAaa	Just use your judgement.  And, wear a bikini if you feel comfortable.  You don't have to cover anything up unless YOU want to!!|`|MCTyWCu2aa	The river float thing would be nice and relaxing i love those things. Just be careful you dont tip off your intertube. Where a bikini to show off your belly.|`|s56Hv7BSaa	that's what im doing this summer but i dont think they allow pregnant people on the slides and stuff. i would just stick to the pools and lazy river and you rock that bikini. i know i am!|`|EzbJsE5eaa	I would be concerned about the slides a bit.. You wouldn't want to hit one of the sides too hard. I think the river should be fine for you. And hell, if you find a cute two piece bikini, rock it! You're pregnant, not fat. And you have nothing to be ashamed of. :) I'm currently looking into some for the summer since I'm due in Sept.  ------  Wow, the answer right above me is almost identical.. :P Great minds think alike!|`|f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	No hot tub and definitely no slides. There will be warnings against pregnant women using the slides anyhow. But the river sounds fine (and relaxing) and wear what you're comfortable in. It's all up to you!|`|e8HCEZDpaa	Water parks are NOT okay during pregnancy. Hot tubs are completely off limits especially now that you are as far along. The slides are an absolute NO NO, and there are signs on all of them saying if you are pregnant you cannot ride. The lazy river would be the only thing that you could do, or just sit out in the sun, which isn't recommended either when you are pregnant.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	Hot tub is not ok, belly in or not. It raises your temperature, that's the problem, not just the temperature of the baby.   Slides, depending on how big, but anythig other than the kiddy stuff would probably be too rough.  Bathing suit, your choice. Some women don't want the UV rays on their stomach but I honestly wouldn't really care. There are really cute 2 piece swimsuits made just for pregnant bellies at Motherhood, and other maternity stores. However, I'm due in August, and will have my big belly then, and I am going swimming in a Hollister bikini, same one I used last year lol|`|zWB3jHHPaa	of course, make sure to do some belly flops while your at it|`|WdRLgvw6aa	I was told by a water park that they only allowed women in they're first and second trimesters.  So, I guess it varies from place to place.|`|2Gve5Xigaa	bikini|`|0de60a89e9f7e2a8a9c90ff78512aa34aa	You can go to the water park. But your not suppose to get in the hot tub its not good for the baby. I would not take a chance going down the slides. You can go on the river to float on that fine. Regarding the bikini its really up to you. How do you feel wearing it. I don't see anything wrong.|`|KK3skQc2aa	Depending on the type of slide (high drop, tall slide, a lot of bouncing around) would determine if you could get on the slide. I always though the hot tub would be a problem but according to my dr, the only time high temperatures really affect your baby is in the first trimester when their spinal column is developing. He told me I could get into water as hot as 104 degrees! He explained it that my uterus is so thick and protected that a 10-15 minute exposure to a hot tub will do nothing to my baby. Now dont stay in there for more than an hour becuase it will then significantly increase your body temp. But you can get in the go do something else while your body cools down and then get right back in....    And if I had the courage to wear a bikini while I was pregnant then I would have. 23 weeks is nothing! Flaunt it|`|pcsLx5tMaa	I went to the waterpark in Sacramento, CA when I was a week OVERDUE! I just sat in the shallow end of the wave pool and went on a couple of the litthe kiddies slides with my 4 year old (pretty much gauranteed not to flip over). Then I just floated on the lazy river. It was great to feel a little more weightless after being pregnant for so long. And wear a bikini...show off that gorgeous belly! I wore a bikini the whole time I was pregnant with my first daughter. I was living in Italy where women went topless and guys wore speedo thongs...so it got me used to not being so self-concious. I never went topless, but I sure showed off my baby bump!
wiAVa1H5aa	You pay attention to your own biases, as we all have them, and talk about it openly and try to work on your own.    Terrorists...  I think of Timothy McVeigh first, but in general young men who are not married, that's my bias.|`|AkFag8tNaa	I wouldn't call it racist to allign a concept (terrorism in this instance) w/a type of person. I'd call it poor judgment. What would be racist would be assuming every muslim is a fundamentalist and is out to kill. When someone asks a question like that and you immediately picture the Middle Easterner, that's the time when you ask yourself why and what can I do to help myself learn more about this culture so I can separate my assumptions from fact.|`|170DwLM5aa	I dont try to erase the idea.  I explain to them that some people do thing that way and its wrong.  We dont judge people because "x,y,z" and then I would tell why.      I would also be that example of how they should act.  But no I dont hide or shield anything.  Why would I?  Its the real world and thats how some people think.     I remembmer a fat white kids calling me the N word when I was in the 2nd grade.  I punched him in the face.  I knew what it meant though and I knew he was being mean.  You cant hide your kids from the big bad world.  I was later taught I should have ignored him.|`|jkgl9WMgaa	Parents have a responsibility to make sure their children understand that racism is wrong, but I'm not sure you example of terrorist is a good one.  For one thing, if the majority of the terrorist we experience, hear about, etc... are mid eastern, then it is not racists to picture them.  You are asking people to deny what they know to be true in order to not hurt someone's feelings.  I want to clarify that I do not have anything against mideastern people.  My dear friend, whom I have adopted as a brother, is from Iran.  I don't have any ill feelings against individuals of any race, but if you asked me to picture a terrorist in my mind, I would see a mid eastern person because the majority are at this time in history.|`|i7oGjwJBaa	only by A: hiding it from them and B: making a point to show good example - and explain it to them if it's not something they might easily just pick up on.|`|488edafbffd854a7df677efa90768cabaa	You have to be alert and say something as soon as you as it comes up. I do my best not to let my children develop such attitudes. So far, so good. My oldest daughter has no concept of why we ever had segregation. She just thinks it's crazy.|`|CJqK40uFaa	i'm going to make sure my son knows the whole truth about everything. growing up black has made me see that there are ALOT of biases and stereotypes that i have to deal with, and him growing up to be a black man is gonna be even harder, especially with me being a single mom. the media basically portrays black men as thugs, drug dealers, etc, and black women as ghetto, hoochies, gold-diggers and though there are some out there, there are just as many in different colors and i want him to know that. Thats another reason im proud Obama was elected, to show my son that he can do what he puts his mind to. I want my son to know that just because someone looks different doesnt mean you should judge them. i.e. middle eastern, asian, white, whatever....|`|1L1AxWoXaa	I actually do not let my kids watch the news. I did not see the original question but I agree with you. I do not view all terrorists as middle easterners. Unfortunately, because that is the image that is most prevalent in the media it is what most people think of.     People tend to forget the true meaning of a terrorist. terrorist - a radical who employs terror as a political weapon; usually organizes with other terrorists in small cells; often uses religion as a cover for terrorist activities. With that said, the nut jobs that bomb abortion clinics are terrorists. Let's not forget about the IRA. Anyone who chooses to use violence to instate change is a terrorist.|`|mAPSl0DZaa	In accordance with the definition of both terror and terrorist I have never visualized what they would look like, A person of such is not determined by the cover they wear on thier head or the cloth to which they adorn thier anatomy with.    A Terrorist could be:    The person next door  your clergy person  kids in a gang  any child at any given age  any teen, adult or elerly person.  Your friendly store owner.    It baffles me as to why society automaticly leans to middle eastern people or those outside of our own United States.    What are Pedophiles, rapist, murderers, racist organizations, gangs, robbers etc . Are they not terrorists? Where is Home Land Security with-in our walls from our very own?|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Sure, we try to teach our kids to think critically, to be fair & to respect individuals for who they are.       We talk about our reactions, other peoples reactions, ideas, etc.  We role play.  We use news, movies, books, other media as conversation starters when we find them.      It's an ongoing process, a life lesson, one that I, myself, am still learning every day.|`|AA11210211	I agree,When I hear the word terrorist I picture all kinds of people because there are terrorists of all races,sizes and genders.Now if someone where to say something about a specific terrorist attack then yes I would picture the race they were.Don't believe the Media half of what they say is crap.
B9KwqnuDaa	I'm just started potty training my son and all he wears is undies and a shirt. The other night him and his dad were goofing around and all of a sudden he pulls down his underwear bends over, pulls his cheeks apart and makes a farting noise with his mouth right at his dad!! I was so shocked all I could do was burst out laughing!|`|AA11210211	lol that's cute!!! Well my son(3 yrs) likes to play bad guy good guy(his version of cops and robbers!!! lol) and last night when he went to give everyone a hug and kiss before bed(we are staying with the in-laws) he gave his grandpa a hug and kiss then said good night bad guy!! It was hilarious.|`|uP08b6K4aa	About two years ago I bought my daughter her first bra.  She was 11 at the time and just after she'd opened it, my son had also opened his playstation so I said to my husband "I think we should get that insured don't you?" and my daughter remarked "WHAT?!?!?!?  MY BRA?!?!?!"    It was a story told to all the family that day and we still can't stop laughing about it!!!!|`|FvYqKZSMaa	My oldest last night said he wanted an apple banana.When I asked him what that was.He was like I meant apple and banana mommy.|`|KWl605JTaa	I was walking around the store with my little brother(he's two) and we walked by this lady and she's like "oooh my goodness hi!" and then my little brother was like "hey i'm not a a**hole, you are an a**hole"    .....  hahahhahahaha|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Lolll nice.  I asked my boy if he wanted to throw the pig skin around (football) and he just made this disgusted face and shook his head. Then i explained and he was like ohhh lol. :)|`|Y32zA5Mfaa	I don't have kids yet, but my brother was definitely a character growing up.  He insisted on calling grilled cheese sandwiches "boy cheese sandwiches", because he had gotten it into his head that we were saying 'girl cheese'.  He also called guacamole 'holy tamole dip'.  :)      And every other child in the universe (ok, maybe just a lot of them) call bananas 'nanas' or naners', but my brother decided that they were called 'ba-la-la-las'.  I still tease him about that to this day (he's 23).     Gotta love it.|`|89b9b79c918cf6555bea31d3d7be7d94aa	my daughter is 21 months and she cracks me up just about every day, she likes to mimic what i say, if i drop something i say "oh shoot" when she says it it sounds more like "oh sh-i-t"!!!! its really cute, also she calls bananas "memo" and lotion "shuky". as for something she does that is funny right now, i doubt it will be in the future though, she rolls her eyes when my husband tells her no or to sit down and eat. a 21 month old rolling her eyes at her dad is cute but i know when she does this at 10+ years old it'll become obnoxious really quick! lol|`|omq3X7wgaa	my three year old niece got a hold of my sisters back massager and turned it on and sat on it and said "that feels good on my butt" LOL my sister has put the massager on a very high shelf|`|1bf2f9586d3ad537a73d55b79612e926aa	On Monday I had to have a Cat scan at a local hospital and because school was out I had to take my girls (14,8 and 3). When we got out of the car my oldest said " look at that tall Ho" and I just went nuts saying how do you know she is a "ho" and we don't say that word etc... the whole time she is just laughing and finally she said mom I said " look at that Tahoe as in the truck" I felt so stupid and she tells the story to everyone.|`|dtHjJah5aa	How cute....lol.  My granddaughter is only 24 days old but when her mommy said something naughty in front of her I said "uhhuhhh" and then my granddaughter repeated me.  It was so funny me and my daughter just busted out laughing...it was like she was right on Q with me.

4YfehneDaa	My daughter started waking up around 6 months too, they say once they start to sit up and crawl they wake up in the middle of the night "to practice"  We started letting her get into bed with us, which only created a bigger problem of her only wanting to sleep with us, i wont do that again!  so my suggestion is a modified cry it out method.  what i do is sit on the floor next to my daughters crib, the first night right next to it and rub her back or whatever until she calms down and goes to sleep or back to sleep.  then every couple of days i would move farther and farther away until i was outside and could just leave her.  it worked beautifully! the first night she cried, but by the time a week was up, she doesn't cry at all and just goes to sleep.  Now for us  we were getting her to sleep in her crib instead of our bed.  so if you are just trying to keep her from waking in the middle of the night you could try something like this.  eventually she will not wake up at all b/c she knows that if she cries you will be there but you are not going to pick her up .  my daughter still wakes up sometimes but she only cries for maybe 30 seconds and goes back to sleep.     i hated the idea of the cry it out method, i feel with doing it this way she knows im right there to comfort her but im just not going to pick her up .|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Even though in some ways I advocate some forms of cry-it-out I hesitate to do so.  Cry it out won't make an over tired baby sleep.  Cry it out won't make a sick baby sleep.  Cry it out won't make a hungry baby sleep.  And cry it out, used simply as a last ditch, desperate measure, will not make a baby sleep through the night.    If you want your child to sleep well, you need to evaluate her sleep and eating patterns throughout the entire day.  You need to study her for cues that she is tired.  You will probably need to rearrange your and the baby's schedule to accommodate her sleep needs.  You need to set realistic goals for yourself and your child.  Many six month old babies don't sleep all night - that is not a realistic goal.    Generally speaking, a child that is waking up that frequently is probably overtired.  She should be napping several times a day, whether in a comfortable, dark room of her own, on your body, or with you in your bed.  If you can arrange for your child to sleep well during the day, you will generally have more success getting them to sleep through the night.    There are other tips but it's best to read several books on the subject and draw your own conclusions.|`|9m2opi6xaa	My son slept through the night starting when he was about 3 months old... oh how blessed i was until about 4 weeks ago he has been getting up again this the what I do... I keep him up as long as he can stand it then feed him (sometimes I give him a bath right before too) once he falls asleep I put him in his crib at about 4 am he wakes up I simply get up and put him in bed with me I know they don't recomend that but he cuddles up close and falls right back to sleep and doesn't get up again til about 8 am. you may want to try that I think its a comfort issue and they feel safe as long as she can move her head it should be fine . And maybe you'll get some sleep...  best of luck|`|oo7p1Etyaa	My son just went through this a week or two ago. There is a very good chance that she is just going through a growth spurt. She is due for one, and 6 months is the avg time for that. When he wakes up through the night, I have him lay in bed with me it makes him happy. I also nurse him though, so it makes it easier for me.  When babies go through growth spurts, they want to eat more often and might be a lil fussy.   OR she might possibly be teething, but that often doesn't include babies wanting to actually eat, they would much rather not eat then.|`|x2z6oiXmaa	its really hard but you should try letting her cry longer and longer- until you stop going in there at all when she doesnt NEED you. My baby is 14 months and she started sleeping through the night at 8  months- I started letting her cry herself to sleep at night and her stamina was impressive- sometimes it would go on FOREVER- but it eventually worked. Good luck|`|TqOdbhNAaa	Is she teething?  I'm having this same problem with my daughter.  It started about a week ago and yesterday, I felt the first bump on her gums from a tooth about to come through.  Check her mouth and if it's teething, you can try drops or tylenol.|`|P2hhUsoMaa	My son sleeps thru the night only when he's in his Kiddoppotamus.  It's that blanket that keeps there arms inside down at their sides.  I have to get the next size since he's getting bigger and I tried putting him to sleep without it and he keeps waking up.  So it's a MUST have for us.  Good luck with your little girl!|`|8f093b57d7153a5ac22f4f6fcf967976aa	I think sticking to the routine will help.  Cry it out doesn't work for everyone, it will tire them out sometimes though.  It might be a few months until she is able to sleep through the night again.    The big key is just trial and error on your part.  If you think something might work, try it.  All kids are different and they don't come with instruction manuals.  Don't worry, you'll find what works best.  Just keep at it.
6qjeneB7aa	I really love the names, but I'm not sold on the nicknames. I think Landon is just too good to shorten. :D|`|1e7f68ee6a0d79eda6c821e9a33f6438aa	Cute names!    also like    Landon Miles  Kristopher Mason|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	I think that those are cute names but the nn are more of what I would name a dog. I like Landon & Nolan together for twin boys!|`|KOcCenrEaa	I like who Kristopher is spelled but Don't like the middle name.  Jeremiah Landon  sounds better and I don't like Landy for a nickname.|`|GtEfBBwAaa	They're not bad, I don't like the nicknames though|`|ae9fc9a3eab22a6443df9b44ecb52d00aa	I only like Landon & Mason, I do not like jeremiah or Kirstopher|`|pLcUFBl2aa	I love those names!!!!|`|d6e11chxaa	They're fine. I don't have a strong opinion about Landon. I find it a bit boring. Unless you're European, Kristopher comes across as a bit kreeative. I think Jeremiah and Christopher make better first names. If I had twin boys, I would name them Theo and Simon.|`|HDGxoFJ1aa	Love the name Landon! Always have X|`|ZvASEWHPaa	hmmm. landon has always seemed like a last name to me (its my BFFs last name).

h57t7FAjaa	Autumn Marie & Madeline Grace (although both mn's are very common, but i like the first names and they flow nice!)    For boys none of them really stick out to me, but I would have to say Timothy Alexander because it sounds the best.    Todd Matthew, Justin Alexander, or Derek Matthew would be nice though :)|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Madeline is pronounced "MAD-uh-line"  Madeleine is pronounced "MAD-uh-lin" (it's French)    Sorry, but it really p*sses me off how people are getting this wrong because of the awful misspelling Madelyn.    Of the girls I like Madeleine (this spelling) and of the boys I like Edward and Alexander.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	I like Autumn but think it goes with Grace better than Marie.    Michelle Elizabeth and Madeline Grace are both lovely.      Autumn is my favorite "name of the moment."    I love Timothy Alexander, but Jeremiah Matthew is a close second.

9vgZNLP8aa	I have them a lot lately. I'm so tired and stressed I feel like I'm going to lose my mind! I'm 38.5 weeks pregnant and I have two other kids under 3 that drive me crazy. I'm Achy and just got over a kidney infection.     My husband is in the army and for some stupid reason they decide his company has to work from 6am to 8-9pm every stupid night for the past week. The kids miss their daddy and have been so unbearable because he hasn't been around. He also leaving for pre deployment training in a month and then right after that he's going to Iraq. We are just grateful he isn't going to miss this baby's birth!    Ok, I feel better now for venting...:P|`|e0xpYnv1aa	Yeah I always feel like crap haha something always hurts or I always feel sick or tired.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Yes and it doesnt get better during later pregnancy or at least it didnt with me. I feel even worse, I am miserable and just cant wait until this baby is ready to come I have 5 more weeks and it seems like an eternity. So you arent alone just embrace your good days and know that soon enough you will have that little bundle of joy in your arms. Good luck and congratulations.|`|ad0F70IMaa	OMG! i'm only 11 weeks pregnant and i feel horrible. im always tired. i still have morning sickness and i don't have the strength to do anything. which makes it hard cuz i have a 3 and 4 year old at home. I just hope this all goes away soon!|`|SDiNKp8oaa	Well, I am not pregnant, but when my mom was (the past 3 times) she was usually laying on the couch sleeping. I have no doubt that she was hurting. I even asked her.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	YES! now that my "morning" sickness is subsiding i'm experiencing some insane headaches they make me crazy...AHH.    fyi: i've read that morning sickness is a good sign that you wont miscarry and my doctor told me a few weeks ago when I was 12 weeks, that once you reach that stage you're very likely to carry your baby full term!|`|hImPK5peaa	I've got a lot of emotions and feelings going on right now,LOL! I'm 4 days overdue and so ready to meet my baby girl.

I am 10 weeks and some days I have really bad mood swings and just feel like I've had enough already. Just relax and don't stress.

I can barely eat and have to take my vitamins right before i go to bed or i throw it up. It stinks I really can't wait until my baby is born. it will all be worth it holding my baby in my arm. :) I guess i will make it, everyone else does.|`|5nAWhEKRaa	OMG in my first trimester I first had the flu it was bad then @ 13 weeks I had a cold and I felt like I couldn't handle it. but now I'm 16 weeks and 1 day pregnant and I fell purity good. Make sheer you get the flu shot that is good for you and your baby but do not get the nasal mist for the flu that has deff anti body than the flu shot. Good luck hope you fell better.
BnJRwJiEaa	I would do like a ball magnet or something that can be use again.  Food I would do like wings, cheese dip, chips, meatballs, smokies, cakes squares, something that both women and men like.
upKzH6fSaa	i had implantation spotting with 2 of my 4 pregnancies, it was light and brownish colored but was only there when i wiped. it never lasted more than 1- 2 days. sounds to me like its your body trying to have a normal period and maybe the pill has thrown it off a bit. everyone reacts differently to their b/c. even after taking it for so long, every month could be the same and then you get a month thats completely different. take another test in a week or so, or maybe go see your dr. good luck to you and God bless|`|Pqz4Yo3haa	I had it with my son, it was just as the other ladies describe, brown tinged mucus for 1-2 days only.    I guess all you can do atm is wait and retest.    xx|`|XyAWAoSoaa	My implantation bleeding was more like tinted cervical mucous is was brown and thick .. jelly looking off and on for 2 days. maybe a total of 5 discharges. Sorry if that's TMI.    I'm not sure if what you're experiencing is it but I guess it very well could be.
ZbnxGIsnaa	Condoms can sometimes result in a accidental pregnancy.  So, I mean it can happen!  If you miss your period take a home pregnancy test on Saturday.  =)  Good luck!|`|x7WphuY5aa	maybe but condoms don't always work i would wait for you period and if it is late take a test|`|o8xNTVWTaa	wait for a missed period and then test condoms like everything Else with sex isn't 100% effective|`|gwuTKiNXaa	you should just wait until you miss a period condoms don't always work correctly and thing sure can happen
AA11294818	Alright, I believe First Response home preg tests can detect preg hormones up to 5 days prior to your expected period. So it wouldn't hurt to do one of those.     As for feeling faint/hot after the shower and nauseous at times.. sometimes that can be just plain hormones. If I don't eat in the mornings when I'm not pregnant sometimes I get that way, if it was a certain time in the month or if my skin was greasier than normal (indicating hormonal things for me) then I would experience these things.  Living with 3 other girls DOES mess with your period.. been there and done that for years. My best friend and I were on separate schedules with our periods so as a result my poor sister ended up getting hers twice a month she was so annoyed.    If your last period was Jan 14th, I would think the 27th 28th of Jan would be prime days to get pregnant, which would mean you would have conceived a little over a week ago if you had at all. Yeah... I got crazy cravings for food 8 days after I conceived, but as for backaches or implantation blood or anything at that point... no. Even the nausea thing didn't really come full on until later, although there was one morning 6 days after I conceived that food looked gross to me.    I don't think intense fingering can cause old blood to come out though. When I finally did have implantation blood about 10 or 11+ days after conception it was brown for a few days then it stopped. Two days later a bright red speck of blood in discharge showed up and then that was it. I know everyone is different though, that's just my experience so you can compare.    Best thing you can do at this stage is take a preg test, and then take another this weekend if you still got a negative.  Don't stress, it'll be ok. Stress will only hurt you in this situation. It's a good thing you are in a longterm relationship, at least, right?    God bless.|`|aEmdURPTaa	Do you know your usual basal body temperature?  If so, implantation produces a light fever, about 1 degree higher than normal.  As for tummy upset, it usually only appears about 6-7 weeks into the pregnancy.  You could have implantation bleeding, but I'm not aware of thighs pain as being a pregnancy symptom.  I didn't have that symptom, nor any of my female friends, mother or other female family members whom I asked.    At this point, it seems you're far enough in time from  your last sexual intercourse, and close enough to your next period, that you could just take a pregnancy test and see if you're pregnant or not.      If you're pregnant, well, congratulations!  If not, and the symptoms persist, why not pay your doctor a little visit to make sure everything is all right?    Let us know how tings turn out!    Good luck! :-)
jpJ0SZBdaa	Each month you hhave a 20% chance of getting pregnant.  I would still BD tonight & tomorrow.  The egg will only surive for 24 hours if it is not fertilized.  GL & HTH|`|gwuTKiNXaa	it sounds like you are just ovulating that is all. this is the best to time to try for a baby|`|x7WphuY5aa	just give it a run it sound like you are ovulating so i would give it a try and let nature take its course|`|0cs6HqxIaa	yea it sounds like you are ovulating. a sperm will stay alive for like 3 days i think it is so you can try now, but it might be a little late. when i was trying my doctor told me to have sex the day before i was ovulating so that the sperm was already in there and alive. but you can still try|`|o8xNTVWTaa	every month is 20 %
10r8cXezaa	I was the exact same way. I told everyone that I was pregnant, and they kept asking me if I had any morning sickness. I kept telling everyone, no, I feel great. But then all of a sudden, one morning, I got a huge wave of nausea, and it was like that for the next three months. Every morning, noon, and night I would be nauseated, like clockwork. It was weird. But all women are different. Hopefully this was just a one time thing for you!    Good luck, and congrats. (It will get better)|`|VS8mactUaa	Everyone is different, I went through my pregnancy with no morning sickness at all, I felt queasy at times but never did throw up. Other people throw up every morning or afternoon or night, sometimes it only happens a few times others it can last a significant amount of time, but there are medications out there that your doctor can prescribe to help with morning sickness, as well Adding ginger to things  like ginger tea can help with home remedies for morning sickness, as well take your time getting up in the morning, when you wake up lay there for a little while and maybe eat some dry non salted crackers. Good Luck ! Lots of Baby dust. :)|`|AA11220327	there is really no "real" answer for this. With both of my older children, I was vomitting all day every day through my whole pregnancies. With this pregnancy, I only had some mild morning sickness for a couple of weeks. Every mom and every pregnancy has completely different symptoms.|`|fHgbL046aa	A lot of women get morning sickness and through up. No one knows if your gonna do it again.I felt nausea's when I was a few weeks along. It was horrible and thought I was dying(I hate being sick). I never did puke thank goodness. I have panic attacks and throwing up is something that will set off a panic attack.(I know weird). I'm now 17 weeks pregnant and started feeling great at 15 weeks so you gotta hang in there. I hear some women are nausea's through there whole pregnancy. If you notice you are losing weight you need to see your doctor.|`|AA11294818	Hey, I'm into my 8th week and I have been trying to not throw up for weeks now. I finally actually vomited my breakfast this past Monday, and then have had morning sickness feeling all week but managed to keep it down. I found that keeping a tiny bit of food in my stomach feels less nauseous than having an empty stomach, and yesterday I actually bought fresh ginger from the grocery to chew on to lessen my nausea which helps a bit.  So what you are describing is EXACTLY what happened to me on Monday. I just hope that I don't have to puke all the time still... I can handle a bit here and there but if I end up vomiting too much I fear I'll hate food forever ;)    God bless and hope your pregnancy goes well!!|`|5805bf3a9bb2e4808ef2d73593aaab11aa	I am now 17 weeks pregnant. I started getting sick at 6 weeks. But I was only nauseated most of the time. From 6 weeks until now, I've only ever thrown up 3 times. You may never throw up again- or you could be sporadic like I was. Sometimes I almost wished I could just throw up so I could feel better for a little while. I feel good now though. I stopped getting sick a couple of weeks ago. :)  Good luck to you! :)|`|EzbJsE5eaa	I'm 7 weeks and 3 days pregnant, and I experience nausea often, but I haven't thrown up at all. I don't think that just because you threw up this once means that you'll keep throwing up. I think it just means that you did once, and it might happen again later. Just be prepared for it. :)|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	there is no way to tell for definate if its going to keep going or stop. everyone is different. i was sick from 5 weeks up untill last week. im 20 weeks now nearly 21. my morning sickness was really bad it was every morning from when it started up until last week. my friend went through her whole pregnancy with only ever gettin sick twice so hopefully you will be lucky and be like that. congrats and good luck|`|gnE9GH5Qaa	I didn't get morning sickness untill I was 6wks so it be just getting worse because ur hormone level is rising. I had horrible sickness I only ate cereal and fruit for the fist 4 months I threw up like 3+ times a day and was in the hospital for three days because I couldn't hold anything down. I have three children and my other two I never got sick. Just talk to ur Doctor about it plus its a sign that everything is going good with the baby!|`|jk6ayFUmaa	at first i just felt sick for awhile but at about 8 weeks i started throwing up to no end. but my friend she only threw up 1 time thats it. my suggestion from my experience dont let yourself get to hungry thats what made me throw up try to eat asap when you get hungry.
IUQZFrMfaa	AHAHAHAHA THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AT MY SCHOOL. especially on fridays, or when its been a really sucky day.  we all rush our of science and down the stairs. the guidance office is right at the bottom of the stairs, so the guidance counselor was like, "anyone who's in ms. bracey's class needs to go back upstairs and come down the RIGHT way" and we were all just like, yeah. sure.   and we all just went to our lockers its hilarious.|`|ekAH05qWaa	yeah that happens at my school too.|`|N24wkFROaa	doesnt happen at mine, the teacher pick whos leaves first haha    :)    we have pips not a bell :P|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	When I was in high school, people used to quickly get out, but no pushing really happened.|`|yFYFSjwcaa	Yes ive gotton run over before...|`|iQ70p3nJaa	YES...the places where the hallways all meet to get to the commons is ALWAYS crowded and it's so hard to get through. and it's those places where three or four hallways meet...|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	No.. Not really.. You ask alot of questions about school :-\ In america are you allowed to leave as soon as the bell goes? :O We have to stay until the teachers lets us go and that might be about 15 minutes after the bell or anything.|`|dPULl5hjaa	so what else is new?|`|WtTAwD4kaa	It happens all the time at my school.|`|VbUpMxrvaa	In high school, yea.  I thought it was dumb..I would just like let everyone pass me and peacefully walk out the door after everyone had already walked out.  :)|`|58eHufb3aa	Not really.|`|lqwEWBdfaa	haha no that doesnt happen at  ours we wait for teacher say we can go (english school) but if the bell goes and we still havent packed up then we all start gettin anxious lol|`|Li9oemwqaa	Ha ha yeah that happens in my history class, this one dude always pulls the dorr shut so no one can get out, tis rather funny coz this one girl needed the loo and he wouldnt let anyone out for like 5 mins|`|LSkeAPBIaa	um well right before the bell rings you hear everyone getting packed up and stuff but we dont kill to get out the door|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	when i was in school that's how it happened...no one wanted to be there so we jsut all ran towards the door when the bell rang.
AA11026827	I know you said a while back that you were really stressed at work.  That could easily be why.  I was supposed to get mine when my school group went to London, but it didn't come for 2-3 weeks after the trip (the trip itself was a week long).  I was stressed during the trip, so it could easily be stress delaying yours.|`|AA11764194	Samething happened to me.. I was suppose to get my period at 23rd Jan , did not get it.. all the pregnancy tests were negative..    I was worried and went to Gyno. he saw big Cyst on left ovary and said that I was not ovulated.. right now I am taking Provera to get my period... and my mind is in peace..    so good luck|`|3X0t8JrXaa	It could be stress.  Did you do urine or blood tests?  A urine test can keep showing negative for some women...so if you haven't taken a blood test I'd get one just to eliminate the possibility.|`|WPI0Z47saa	it could be stress or can be from being ill. Was it a urine test at the doctor? My urine test didn't come back positive until I was 5 weeks pregnant. A blood test would tell you 100%.|`|s56Hv7BSaa	it could be cuz of your illnesses and stress. go to the doc and tell them cuz they might have to induce your period. that's what they did with my friend|`|JMOLRKRraa	std might cause period delay.
jG8b3Mz0aa	I'm looking forward to it. I'm trying to prep myself up for it since I'm scheduled for induction on Monday. I think I'm a bit more nervous because it's not happening naturally on its own like I would have liked. I'm afraid this labor may be different (more painful, difficult to bare) since I'll be given meds to start. I had my daughter naturally and it was fine but now since I'm getting help I'm just not too sure how it'll be. All in all I'm very excited and can't wait. These last 4 days seem like there going by so slow.|`|T48smu01aa	I am 25 weeks and I am so ready to be in labor its been a rough ride since the beginning so I can't wait till labor I am actually pumped for the pain haha....I had morning sickness so bad I could literally not move off the couch for two months I gained like 30 pounds right off the bat so my body is sore and it hard to walk now haha and my back aches constantly....I have gallstones which are extremely painful aahhh just want the baby to be ready already hahaha.....I am with you!  Good luck and congrats!!|`|LNnRSLdtaa	im not even pregnant and im terrified of it  i think id actually ask for a c section  though i heard they dont just do c sections because you asked, there has to be a reason.|`|oXFVRYCsaa	I'm 34 wks pregnant, i would say i'm looking forward to labour obviously because there is going to be alot of pain but i know that once she is out it will be all worth it, just keep thinking it will be over soon and you will have a beautiful little baby in your arms    Have you heard of Hynobirthing? you can actually buy a CD to teach yourself, i have found some on ebay i'm bidding on one at the moment, it basically teaches you to stay calm and to train your body to fight the pain the natural way, alot of woemen have commented on this and have said it helped them through labour and they got through it only having Gas and Air, i would defo look into it, i am bidding on the Ebay Uk site just in case you can't find it, if you are in the UK you can actually go and see a therapist that will help too    All the best & Good Luck|`|b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	I am so excited for labor. I know it's going to be the most painful experience in the world but it's for a good reason, like you said, and in the end you'll be holding your baby and finally be able to get your body back to yourself. I'm so ready.  I understand 100% where you're coming from. Here's to hoping labor goes good and comes soon!|`|VUss5AfAaa	omgosh you dont even know..im 38 weeks and 5 days..  i herd im 1cm dilated ..so im actually looking foward to it..  you know i havent really thought about the pain..i just keep dreaming about my baby boy in my arms.    im anxiously waiting for his arrival.and as for the pain i bet it will be worth it at the end.|`|1EwbKkKCaa	I'm only just under seven weeks and I am so ready for labor. I want nothing more to hold my child. No pain in the world is as wonderful as labor pain. And it doesn't last long at all. My last labor was terrible also and I want to have a great experience this time.|`|J3VSkIE9aa	girl your nuts. i was in labor for 36 hours, spent three hours pushing, had a third degree tear and my son was born looking like the aliens from the movie "alien" and he had a giant bruise around his head.|`|nvYgdxk1aa	I am not pregnant but with my first and only (so far) I was pumped and ready... then things went wrong I had 3rd degree tears from having the baby basically ripped out of me by a vacuum and had 8 week of recovery from the horrendous tears and stitches and then sex wasn't comfortable for another year after that. To say the least my last experience makes me scarred to even start trying for another baby, even though my husband is ready and our son is at a good age for a baby brother or sister, I am just plain terrified. Kudos to you for getting over your fears! Congratulations and good luck!|`|WdRLgvw6aa	I totally agree with you.  I'm totally looking forward to labor.  Every day,  I talk to my baby and tell her all about our big day when we'll be working as a team to bring her into the world.  :)|`|52U22fiAaa	I'm looking forward to it!  Not the pain, but the experience overall :)|`|AA11220327	I am deffinitly looking forward to it, but not completely for myself. This will be my 3rd natural birth, so I know what to expect and all that, but my husband has never experienceed it. Our other children are from our previous marriages, and his daughter was a c-section. So I am most excited about him getting to experience a natural vaginal birth.|`|lzUF22l0aa	i cant wait im 35 weeks and im praying labor starts any day now .. ithink the second time around also things are deffinlty more painfull and uncomfortable. I wish thios baby would come now!!!! And labor deffintly doesnt scare me like it did the first time i had a great experience the first time the only thing that worries me is i think imight not be so lucky the second time around. But who knows as long as my baby and i come out safe ill be happy! Best of luck to you
AA11100991	Perhaps your son is deficient in certain vitamins. Although you might think the rind is not tasty, it also has vitamin c in it, which helps to digest iron. Also, the bone marrow of the chicken contains iron as well. Sometimes, when a child prefers crunchy/odd things to eat, it is a sign of a condition called pica, where he or she might be a bit anemic, not because the needed foods are not given, but because he or she does not consume them. It might be that, like you said, he is just being a toddler and eating odd things. At the same time, if it worries you, it never hurts to ask your doctor about this and even have a bloodwork profile done to determine if there are nutritional issues involved.|`|uP08b6K4aa	Children don't associate food the same as we do as adults, so if he's given food he will eat it or not.  However, allowing him to eat the rind off the orange is probably not such a good idea with his stomach, it can cause upset as can banana skins, they're there to be taken off and not eaten!    As for chicken drumsticks, please don't give him these again, he's liable to choke, strip the meat off it instead as with other foods which may contain bones.|`|Gnhgfx4naa	LOL!!! My son does the EXACT same! Food is food right? LOL|`|OOL4XdjPaa	just start handing him everything upside down and see if he flips it to eat the right side.  haha    good luck|`|KWl605JTaa	what an odd child.  never heard of it.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Maybe he enjoys the harder texture, the orange rind, the chicken bone, and the pizza crust are all hard. Have him checked for anemia, I used to eat ice and always want to crunch down on something, have been anemic for most of my life.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	Haha kids are so funny like that. When my son eats and apple he eats the whole thing core and all!! I don't know why! Now after seeing it my husband and a couple of our friends eat the whole apple too.|`|mkOiK8ikaa	Children eat what their body tells them to, so these strange eating habits may point to a deficiency in certain vitamins/minerals. Make sure his diet is well-rounded. Also don't feed him chicken drumsticks!|`|omq3X7wgaa	feels good on his teeth/gums|`|7IHMjy2caa	He doesn't know not to.     You shouldn't be giving him chicken with bones in it or oranges with peels still on at this age.     As for the pizza, all kids have stange eating habits. My daughter is the opposite. She will pick the topping off, leave them on her plate and just eat the sauce covered part. When she gets to the crust she throws it away.|`|4cprznZcaa	my younger sister ate the orange peel when she was younger and my mom was concerned, she asked the doctor and he said that the peel was providing her with something her body needed (calcium?). i wouldnt really worry about that. about the other things maybe hes just a weird eater, i was and still am!|`|TawyLobZaa	Because he is a toddler. I think at this stage, kids are more into experimenting with their food than worrying about the proper way to eat it, or the nutritional value of what they are ingesting. At this age, my son used to take everything and put it HALFWAY into his mouth (the other half left hanging out) and shake his head so the outside half would hit his cheeks back and forth (rather like when a dog grabs a rag bone and shakes it.)  Was tremendously messy, not to mention embarassing in public. But he did it for about a month, then moved on to other things. Just make sure he is not getting anything dangerous, cut the peels from all fruits, and make sure he is getting the nutrients he needs. And dont worry, he will outgrow it.|`|XqY0nJhOaa	do you have any dogs maybe he is trying to act like a dog but im not so sure... you should take him to the docter and tell them this and ask them for a tharapist to avaluate if he is speacial ed or just to see how his mental well being is it will really help and they will keep a close eye on him and see what is going on he might just b being a kid but who knows the best way to determain whats going on is to have him evaluated by a shrink.. i hope this helps and sorry for my bad spelling|`|Epc3c1t4aa	i have no idea but not to long a go my friend  were at the lunch tabl on of them  dared me to eat the oramge hole 19 by the way and kriby said you know that the hole orange has all the protien you need for the day|`|dtHjJah5aa	Don't know why he's doing this but as long as you are washing the rind very well, it shouldn't hurt him.  Please read below:    Fruits, vegetables and juices    Rinse all raw fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating or cooking them. Even produce with a peel or rind can become contaminated with bacteria when cutting or peeling it.     Try to remove bruised or cut areas on fruits or vegetables, where bacteria can thrive.     Use a vegetable brush to remove any visible surface dirt from produce.     Always refrigerate pasteurized juice.     Never give infants, children or adolescents unpasteurized juice unless the fruit is washed and freshly squeezed just before drinking.     Be sure that any juice you purchase does not contain a label stating the product is unpasteurized. If it is unclear whether juice has been pasteurized, do not let your child drink it.     Consumers of any age should never eat raw bean sprouts. They may have bacteria that are nearly impossible to remove or destroy, even by heating or thoroughly washing the sprouts.|`|PZLwu9QAaa	I don't know that there is any clear answer as to why they do the things they do.  Children are curious, and their taste buds have not fully developed yet.  My daughter ate an entire chicken bone when I tried giving her a drumstick.  Now I know she can only have boneless chicken :).  I will always peel her bananas and give her just the fruit, and I will always peel her orange before I give it to her.  All children experiment with taste...it's just the way it is.
wWGNvMIQaa	Get on a regular exercise plan. As soon as you feel up to it, focus on your core muscles. It wont happen instantly, but it WILL happen if you stick with it. That combine with diet will do the trick. I know your thinking you've heard that a thousand times, but there is a reason it is repeated......it's true!!!!! It takes time. But if you want to know what to do until then, tight (not too tight) stretchy undershirts can make everything look firmer, and I know you don't want to hear it but go up a pant size. If you get pants that fit, It will actually make you look slimmer. No one is gonna know a number, they just know what you look like, and if you look thinner, they are going to think the number is smaller!!!!! The buckle is perfect because there jeans actually go by waist in inches and length. (Kind of like guys jeans) So you can always find the perfect fit there, and the people who work there can tell you what jeans will look good for you body shape. Hope this helps.|`|0VJE7BXmaa	Wear some shapewear to hold everything in for the next few months.  It will take about a year for everything to go back in, and you do not need to be exercizing too soon.  Take care of yourself, rest, and enjoy your baby!|`|nzgZR6onaa	Don't get to comfy in sweats because you won't really notice the tummy as much and may put on a little rather than loose.Yoga stretching is a good way to safely get back into shape.And a girdle or shape holder will keep you from having to go up a size in jeans while the getting back in shape process is taking place..|`|2Gve5Xigaa	diet!  sweat pants(:|`|KWl605JTaa	walk it off|`|4nHrbehraa	Lower your carb intake (peanut butter is a great source of protient) and drink nothing but water for at least a week.  You should drop weight very quickly but will creap back up if you load up on carbs!!!|`|5gHtVI5Caa	try paige jeans, they are expensive but worth it...
M5E3mDBJaa	Spit up is usually whatever was on top of the stomach - generally just formula and usually happens soon after a baby has eaten.      Vomit usually includes other stomach matter or partially digested material.  Spit up usually comes up looking pretty much unchanged from the way it went down, whereas vomit has a distinct look.    Edit:  Diarrhea is not always about the consistency but more about the frequency.  If your 2 a day baby suddenly has 8 poopy diapers in a 12 hour period then you are almost definitely dealing with diarrhea.|`|heDtLdz5aa	spit up just comes up..throw up is when the baby gags and it is forcefully coming out...as far as diarreha goes..soft and mushy is okay...it is bad when there is alot of water in the stool and more runny..|`|TqOdbhNAaa	I was told that vomit is forceful and spit up just sorta leaks out.  I'm sure this isn't always the case, but I can see why you would follow it.  When a baby spits up, it's because they have too much in their bellies and some "leaks out".  When a baby is sick and vomiting, the stuff is forced out of their bellies.  Not sure if this is true because my daughter hasn't vomited before .|`|bMvAmMTaaa	i think vomit is like projectile (effects her/his whole body and baby looks shocked after, and can come out of nose) and spit up is like dribble but a bit more fluid...also they smell different, you can smell when it is vomit. i think vomit also looks like curdled milk with small soft bits in it.    hope this answers ur question.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Vomit vs. Spit up--everyone knows what spit up looks like (LOL), but vomit has more mucus and less of the "curdled milk" texture (this is what the DR. told me).    Runny Poop vs. Diarrhea--My mom told me this and she raised 9 kids so I trust she's probably pretty much right.  Real true diarrhea will turn the butt red.  It has a much more acidic quality than regular runny poop, so it burns their little bottom    EDIT:  I so meant MORE of the curdled milk texture, not less.|`|dgM66nRBaa	youll know diarrhea! when my daughter has it, it runs everywhere... makes me sick to the point where i want to throw up. and i dont throw up during a regular dirty diaper.|`|AA10316916	spit up dribbles out and it looks like what went in, vomit is forceful and often sour milk and icky and smelly and yucky (no other way to describe it)......mushy poo is normal for babies, watery poo isn't.|`|hJoB7VR1aa	Vomit will stink really bad due to that acid from the stomach. The difference from baby poop to diarrhea is that diarrhea will be much more watery with very little consistency. Just feed a bland diet and make sure she stays hydrated.
3SIRKIBaaa	Yes the pulling part has happened to me before especially when I would walk. It's natural and you'll feel it more as your baby grows. Your uterus rises above your belly button and when you go to your upcoming doctor appointments you'll see just how much it has grown when they measure you. For pregnancy that weeks are 7 days, not 5. And according to my doctor, your second trimester begins in your 14th week. I never really did the needle and thread trick so that one I'm not too sure about :). But if you want the answers to ALL your questions that you asked above, go to www.baby2see.com and it'll have the answers to all those questions. I LOVE that website and I'm on it every week checking my baby development. You'll love that site!|`|5GPDrBPLaa	About the pain...    I remember this when I was pg.  It hurt so bad that it scared me.  I told the doctor about it at the next appt. and he confirmed that it was just my muscles and ligaments stretching/expanding to allow for more room.  Good luck to you!|`|3K7ffKn2aa	wow that's a lot of question lol ok   1. No it doesn't mean you will be showing soon i'm 25 weeks and depending on what i wear i look like i've been going overboard with the debbie snack cakes. lol  2. It eventually goes above it   3. I go by this table (2nd source) but ask your doc   4. I never really did that one.     congrats and good luck|`|vZwJyqc6aa	I am going thru the same thing. When I stand up after sitting down for a few, I feel like my lower stomach is pulling, like it's really heavy. I am 16 weeks now. I've felt this for a couple weeks. Not sure what to attribute it to but I'm sure it's normal. I believe 14 weeks is your last week in the first trimester.|`|JITTMjasaa	You doc is partially right. All of your organs are slowly being moved around. Not only that but your uterus is growing. This means that it will be a little sensitive to movement. Just go about your normal routine just do it a little slower. Avoid twisting movements and do a lot of light stretching. Your uterus will rise to about your ribcage. This happens slowly but during the last few months you will definitely feel it. You will feel short of breath and sometimes pain in the lower lungs and upper back. Don't worry, it's just the baby moving around. Just a tip, you don't have to suffer through the break-dancing on your bladder/lungs/kidneys...You can move the baby around. Just gently massage whatever area is hurting you and the baby will squirm out of the way. Just don't expect total comfort. Pregnancy is a pain in the...everything but in the end you will see how strong you really are. I don't know about the calculations. People are wrong a lot. Base it on what your doctor says. Babytobe is a good web sight to go to but you will get better info with a pregnancy book. Good luck, God Bless|`|Ux4gGIAEaa	I AM 14 WEEKS 6 DAYS AND FEEL THE PULLING AND STRETCHING TOO.  I WAS TOLD IT WAS JUST EVERYTHING GROWING AND EXPANDING AND MAKING ROOM.  THEY COUNT THE WEEKS AS 7 DAYS.  I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THE NEEDLE AND THREAD TRICK BUT MAYBE YOU CAN TRY A CHINESE GENDER PREDICTION CALENDAR. YOU CAN GOOGLE IT AND IT MIGHT GIVE YOU WHAT IT MIGHT BE.  TRIMESTER I HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD! LOL|`|KK3skQc2aa	Pulling and stretching occur because of the expanding fetus against your abdominal muscles and tendons. It doesnt necessarily mean you will be showing any quicker.     Your uterus will expand litterally up under your breasts at full term pregnancy, not just to your belly button. I am 39 weeks pregnant and my uterus is 7 inches higher then my belly button.    Pregnancy weeks are in 7 days......because that is a week.    Trimesters were explained to me by my dr as follows:  1-12 weeks first trimester  13-28 weeks second trimester  29-40 weeks third trimester|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	That doesnt mean you will be showing a lot more this is just the time in pregnancy your uterus grows to that point so it just depends on your body of when you will start to show.  The uterus rises well above the belly button by the end of pregnancy, remember your baby has to fit inside your uterus until birth.  Weeks count by 7 days, it is calculated either by last period which would be the 15 weeks or gestational which would be the 14 weeks.  Trimesters go back 3 months, when you are completely done with your third month then you start your second trimester, it does get confusing.  I dont know about the needle and thread trick I never tried it.  Hope this all helps, good luck and congratulations.
vue9NOhYaa	She can nurse on one side only. SHe'll get plenty of milk.  You can pump the other side and save the milk for later use, and keep offering.     Or try changing sides without turning her over.  You may be able to trick her into taking it.    Or you can let the unprefered side dry up. YOu will look lopsided, but a little padding in your bra will take care of that problem.     I'll also mention that if this is something new, she might have an ear infection. Lying on the infected side can be painful, and she'll resist doing it. So, if you have any suspicion that she's hurting or ill, give the doctor a call.|`|M5E3mDBJaa	Wow some people are (another word for) donkeys today! - Don't listen to them.    Seems like your daughter has a comfort preference.  I would try to hold her the way she is refusing to feed as much as possible when you are not nursing - hopefully in a day or two she will realize that being held that way is just as comfortable as the other way and will once again take the breast.|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	She will nurse that side eventually if you leave her on it long enough. Its pretty normal with a lot of babies.|`|1SxVIZd7aa	you could try pumping on that side. You can always store the breastmilk in the freezer for use later on. I would keep trying though, maybe she will start feeding from that side soon.|`|tAyhtXZ6aa	Email me on yahoo, AllieSophia82@yahoo.com Im a expert with Breastfeeding I can probably help you,|`|AA11595360	i know my wife had the same problem with our youngest son. I not sure of the reason but he was stubborn about it.. Well she had to bite the bullet and be more stubborn. She would only let him nurse on the side he DIDNT want to and he gave in when he got really hungry.|`|WPI0Z47saa	I breastfeed my son for 18 months. I always had a harder time on the right side. The lactation counselor told me that most women have a hard time on the side in which they use to write. You actually hold the baby a little different and it can make them uncomfortable. I actally had more success on that side lying on my side. The cradle hold on that side did work after awhile but lying down was easier and more comfortable. Yes you will stop producing milk on that side if you aren't using it. That could be another reason why your baby is fighting you. There may not be much there and this would frustrate the baby. If the baby won't eat off that side than feed on the side that they like, but still pump the other side to make sure you keep a good milk supply established. You will have to play around with different positions until you find one that works for you two. There is also a great book called "so that's what they're for" and it will walk you through almost any problem that can arise while breastfeeding. Don't give up or get frustrated, it will work. It takes a lot of practice.|`|vOomJtbsaa	Try hand expressing milk around the nipple, then see if she latches on.  You are in a pickle, the only other alternative is to pump otherwise you may deal with engorgement on one side or the other.   Also, hand express your breast if she latches onto that side, the milk should flow faster.  Hope this helps a little!|`|iH2whFkHaa	You already got some good advice here from other people; but I noticed that nobody mentioned one possible cause: If she refused the one side very suddenly, and you can feel a lump, then it may be that you have a tumor. Very unlikely but possible.     Try lying down with the breast that she is refusing on the top, and the one she doesn't refuse closest to the bed. Prop her up on some pillows or blankets and try to feed her from the top breast and see if she takes it.|`|f7f979166d56e9db52bddbf243ac866daa	My daughter did this for a while.  I basically humored her and she got over it.  I didn't worry about pumping.  If it really comes down to it one breast can handle all the production fine, chances are that you may slow on the un-nursed side but you won't completely stop.  Try to feed her on the preferred side first then finish up on the other.  There's always a possibility there a reason like fluid in her ears that bothers her laying on one side or possibly just swallowing on that side.  You shouldn't really worry just give it chance to sort out.  My baby went through a time when she wouldn't nurse much more than a minute per side, I've was flipping her back and forth and she seems to have gotten over that too.  That was while she was teething, the one sidedness might have been that first tooth now that I think of it.  We dealt with sore gums and pickiness for months before they broke through.  That might be your case as well if one side presses that tooth.      Best wishes|`|NoWQWWlEaa	pump that side and save it|`|zJHrFBtNaa	I don't really know but I think you should speak to a nurse.|`|OYkQrqmeaa	I wonder if it's because of her comfort when you hold her while nursing.  Maybe something hurts her or is uncomfortable when you hold her on the side she doesn't seem to like.  Ask your doctor how to figure it out.  Maybe she has a sore, or sensitive spot that is irritated when you hold her on that side.  Have you tried a nursing pillow?  Good luck.|`|0ca6f6ce6afa279f3ccc449197fd3d7daa	just keep pumping, so the milk doesnt stop coming out on that side and keep trying to put her on there everyday maybe one day shell catch on. good luck!|`|tdHIR9cLaa	uhhh maybe position her on that side the same as you do on the side she likes... face her the same direction... like if you football hold her on the side she likes then  cradle her on the other side, or visa versa...even though i can clearly see that you don't want to pump becasue of your edits lol... i think that if what advise i gave you doesn't work or anybody elses for that matter i think pumping is your only choice... and i just want to add that i am not an idiot.. i just think that may be what you are going to have to do...|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	try laying down in bed. she will nurse eventually|`|oo7p1Etyaa	I would try not offering the other that she wants. When she gets hungry enough she will drink it. My son is that way with bottles, Occasionally I have had my fiance's grandmother watch him and he really would rather not have the bottle but once he realized that was the only way he was getting to get fed he would drink it.|`|MXWyX4PRaa	It's possible it's the position she doesn't like, rather than the flow.  You might try using a "football hold" ( 3 on this page):  http://www.breastfeeding-mom.com/how-to-...  That will have her lying in the same position, nursing from the other breast.    As others have suggested, you can also pump that side and save the milk for a babysitter or Dad to feed her in your absence.  It's always a good idea to have a bit of milk stored in the freezer just in case.  Here is a messageboard archive about this subject, with several suggestions to try as well: http://www.storknet.com/cubbies/breast/a...    If all else fails, it's ok to nurse from only one side and allow the milk to dry up on the other side.  It can cause a lopsided appearance in some, but that doesn't happen often, and there's no health risks or drawbacks otherwise.|`|BqXSymxjaa	I can't think of any other alternative other then pumping. I don't think you will dry up on that side though. I searched the internet and couldn't find anything about it. You should ask your Dr.|`|6fiYhtACaa	I had this same problem - but with BOTH breasts! Poor son would choke and gag a little. I remedied it by hand expressing on to a burp cloth before starting and tilting onto my back to nurse so that the flow was slowed down by gravity. It helped and baby eventually learned how to manage the flow as he got older.|`|HfXrY43Paa	More than likely you are going to have to pump. But since you don't want to do that I would suggest that you "drain" the other breast that you are not using in the shower that way your chest doesn't harden. But it will get painful if the milk "sits" too long.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	You could try to express some milk from the unfavored breast so that when your baby latches the milk is right there ready to go.  It could be like you suggested, the flow isnt the same.  Also could try to start her on the preferred side and than switch to the other when she is somewhat satisfied.  And if all fails, you may need to pump it eventhough you dont want to, this could be a phase and soon will pass but you dont want to loose your milk on that side in the meantime.|`|SNVauR3laa	Start her on the side that she prefers, then move her over to the other side. Maybe if she's not starving, she will be more patient. Either that, or depending on her age, you could rub a little applesauce on the nipple.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	I think she prefers the way she lays on the other side.  Try laying down on a bed with her, putting her head to your breast and putting her feet up towards your head.  This will allow her to lay on her most comfortable side.  Good luck............|`|hJoB7VR1aa	My daughter did this as well. If your baby is like mine was there is absolutely no way she is going to nurse that side. I just feed her on the side she liked and pumped the other.|`|SeAvCGlYaa	Try to drain that breast a little bit to make it softer, perhaps? You mentioned the milk flows faster on that side... perhaps there's just too much for her to handle and she doesn't like it.     You may have to pump a little, unfortunately, or hand express.     Be patient. I know it's terribly hard to do right now, but she has to learn to nurse from both sides.     Perhaps you could contact a local La Lache League consultant or call your local hospital and ask to speak to the lactation consultation on call at the moment. Good luck.
yCwPxulYaa	When I have tried pumping, I cannot get anything either.  I do not have the let down when I am pumping, that I have when my baby is nursing.  The baby is much better at emptying the breast then the pump is.     The only way I can get anything is to let my baby nurse on one side, and pump the other.  I have gotten 5 oz out of one side doing this.     You can try holding her while you pump or holding a blanket that smells like her when you pump.|`|b06f1889b2a964c874c9d8638960020baa	I have days where I pump tons of milk and others when I can barely get any.  Don't give up, just keep doing it.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	Same here. It's easier to pump in the morning when my breast is full. What I try is I feed my baby one side about twice so the other side get full, and then I pump that breast out. It is hard to pump & find time to pump it out(sometimes it takes so long...).|`|gx4s68s8aa	I could be your pump- some pumps don't work as well as others.  I had the Medela In Style pump and it was great.  But even with that pump it might take a while for you to get used to it and be able to pump a decent amount.    Also, try breast massage.  Do this before you pump and if possible while you pump.  It really helps make the pump act more like regular breast feeding and thus you should get more out and more hind milk.

u4liwDhAaa	There is nothing wrong with what's his done!  In the military, if you are a single parent or if both parents are in the military, you need to have a plan for your children like who are they going to be with when deployed.  Bottom line, if you don't have a plan, you are in trouble.    He sounds like a very caring, and concerned father.  He is doing what's best for his daughter.  People should not be judgmental.  He is making a living which is more than I can say for some.  He is taking care of business and of his daughter.    I applaud him!|`|7IHMjy2caa	When you ask a question on here people are judging on the details of a moment in a life. Not on all the back story and the reasons why.    Based on what you've said here, I see nothing wrong with it. He did it to provide stability and normalcy. I think he should be praised for acting in his daughters interest despite the pain it must have caused him.     Still a lot of people won't read the details and will just think another man abandoning his child. Wrong, but as I said people on here can't judge on the background and the details because most of the time they don't know them.|`|AA11729534	Well I'd have to see what was said here and what the scenerio was when he received the replies.  With the little bit of information you have given me I don't see anything wrong considering.  As long as he is supporting completely by providing the money to his parents for all of her needs (he's very lucky to have them and so is his daughter) and as long as when he is home he spends all of his time with her (since he is deployed otherwise and her mom is passed away - he should be spending all of his time with her completely when home) ...and is working hard to eventually get himself into a position to take on full responsiblity of her one day - then where he is at right now with the situation seems fine with me.  If he's in the the service and her mom is passed away - then his parents caring for her is fine for now (but he - not they - should be FULLY supporting her) and as long as he's spending all of his time home when he is home exclusively with her - then I see that as very responsible.|`|sLLgERQWaa	Every since his daughter has been posting here I've gone to bat for her dad....he did what was best for her under the circumstances....most people who criticize don;t understand that sometimes the best thing for a child may not be with the parent, and those parents who realize this and put themselves aside for the needs of their child are doing one of the most selfless and difficult thing.....ignore those people as they most likely are very young/childless. Once you've had kids of your own, you understand.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	If more people would do what your fianc did for his daughter, children wouldnt be in bad conditions or suffering. He did what he had to do. Does anyone thank him for being over there serving our country? No, theyre just really quick to judge him for putting his child in a good, STABLE environment with his parents, people he trusts.     There are so many mothers on here that are likeanti-fathers and because of their situation, they assume all men are deadbeats. And thats not the case. Here you have a man who did what was best for his child. Or is it better for her to travel from station to station, be uprooted from school to school, make friends than lose themhave a completely unstable life.     I commend your fiance. Props to him for putting his child first. Im sure what he did was FAR from easy, but he sure as hell didnt ditch her. In fact, its beyond the opposite!    Dont stress about the comments here. Its absolutely not worth it!|`|uP08b6K4aa	I'm not quite sure what the problem is with people to be honest if he's in the forces, he's made the right decision in my honest opinion given the time they're away and the risks they take!    If he's home from duty then I hope he spends as much time as possible with her, so that she knows who her dad is, but other than that I feel he's made the right decision.  I haven't read your other posts I'm basing my opinion on this one.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	People judge without knowing the real story.It sounds like he still cares for her.That does not make him a bad parent.He spends time with her and gets her what she needs.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	" But can someone explain the problem to me?"    Possibly, after you state, concisely, what it is.    Who has a problem?  You ?  Him?|`|weE5FxCfaa	people are very judgmental and don't always try to press what they feel is right on others.  does this child know who her father is?  is she financially provided for? is she emotionally provided for?  the only thing that i would take into consideration is her feelings on not living with her dad, especially if and when you 2 might have other children.  she may feel left out.  a good friend of mine was in the airforce and had custody of his daughter because her mother was unfit.  when he was deployed his parents took her and she was fine.  when he got back however he did have her come live with him again.

PS: I always had an u/s at my second visit around 14 weeks just to rule out that there were no twins. PCOS in and of itself shouldn`t make you have an earlier u/s. They normally don`t like to do earlier just because its harder to see the yolk sac the earlier you are. Even at 14 weeks they need to do it transvaginally. Especially if your doc has older office equipment...    *me screaming again!!*|`|RE6GBw0Baa	oh hunni thats so great.    im so happy 4 u xxxxx    best wishes chick    YAAAAAYYYYYYYYYY xxxxxxxx|`|b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	Awww congrats!!!!!

I found that I have a tilted uterus too.|`|QQEqEqFzaa	Doggie style, missionary, both are said to be good as the Penis is very close to the cervix.|`|jNPCT96Xaa	There is a technique called Mayan Abdominal Massage where they actually work to balance your body (internally) noninvasive. I know of 7 people who have don't this and it has helped with problems beyond infertility. As soon as I can get in to have it done I am doing it. It apparently helps to restore the natural balance and alignment inside creating more blood flow. Sometimes a tiled uterus is due to stretched ligaments, adhesion's, etc. I would look into it. Otherwise, I think any position that puts semen as close to where is needs to be as possible is your best bet, which can vary depending on which direction your uterus is tilted.
gx4s68s8aa	Not a problem-  I have Factor V as well.  Will you be on blood thinners after your pregnancy?  I was for 6 months after my first child and it was fine to be on coumadin and breast feeding.  With this pregnancy (I am 31 weeks) I think I will stay on the Lovenox that I am taking for a while and breast feed.  I still have to talk to my high risk doctor about Lovenox and breast feeding.  But my regular OB thinks it will be fine.     If you have any other questions- just contact me and ask.    I tried to email back but kept getting failure notices-  Good to hear from you- No I am heterozygous as well.  But with my first pregnancy I had a DVT in the 26 week.  But I got to the hospital in time and all was well. But I was on Lovenox twice daily after that.  Then coumadin for 6 months.  Now I take Lovenox injection once daily to prevent another clot from happening.  When you get pregnant, your doctor is going to at least put you on aspirin, right?    But anyway.  The whether on blood thinner or not, breast feeding is fine.|`|nzgZR6onaa	Breast feeding will not cause this it is genetic.So if your baby was going to have this it would already be in the babies genetic makeup.As far as blood clots in the breast your baby is sucking milk from the breast not blood.Do research on the net to get more info on the subject and talk to the doc about it also.
GcxpffgOaa	My son is almost 15 months and we went through the same thing with him. I found that he would not drink out a sippy cup he just wanted to play with it. We tried the sippy cup with a soft tip (almost bottle tip feeling if that makes sense) and he does fine with it. He still will not drink out of the hard tipped sippy cups a lot but he is completely off the bottle and has been now for about a month. Try that out. We try to alternate the hard tipped for the soft tipped and he will drink out of the hard tipped but just a very little bit. Hope that helps|`|2c89cd9f9d087548a3d65a53e0d5756baa	He will when he know the bottles are all gone and sippy cup is the only option.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	Have you tried every brand? Walmart has one that my daughter liked, it sucks like a bottle.|`|nfzQkvqraa	Try to find the sip cup that looks/feels the closest to his bottle.  Then take all the bottles away during the day and only offer him the sip cup.  Offer him a nice salty snack with his cup.  He'll get thirst, he'll drink it.  (that sounds mean I guess....I'll probably get a bunch of thumbs down for the salty snack)  I'm being serious about the type of sippy cup you use.  That really can matter to a child.|`|sqaey2Siaa	I think every child goes through this!! You have to buy millions of diffrent sippy cups and just try them all. My son did best with the straw sippy cups at first - now he will drink out of any sippy cup. It just takes time.|`|GLnVPp2Caa	I had a hard time with sippies that had hard spouts.  Try the Avent brand sippy with the soft spout.  It's an easier transition.      (Make sure you wash it carefully.  The "sippy spout" is 3 pieces and if you don't take them all apart to dry, it will mold inside. LOL)    Also, some kids skip sippies all together and go straight to cups.  Maybe that's an option too?
deEs2ta8aa	Ugh, no but I have seen stoooopid questions on here with basically the same thing! They're so dumb. They think they're just having a BABY, but really they're creating a whole new life! Someone that will grow up and be a teenager, an adult etc... it's not just a decision to have a cute little baby.    Not to mention they obviously don't understand how much babies COST, money wise.     I wanna slap them too! =]|`|dPULl5hjaa	pathetic low life scum|`|r39EDGhPaa	I did see that.    If we are talking about the same episode, I started cracking up when Tyra stood up and went "all of you sound SO stupid". ahaha.    I didn't want to slap them, I wanted to punch them.|`|J3TRJPIwaa	Can I slap them next? Is this the same one that one of the girls said her boyfriend of 2 months would support her and help raise their baby if they got pregnant like she wanted. Stupid girls!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I saw that one. How stupid can you be being so young and trying to get pregnant!|`|FGZR9RwDaa	haha wowwww  stupid(:|`|EccBqsntaa	No..But I've seen one like that on the Maury show. I thought that they were idiots.|`|kLPaq30Eaa	Yes! I wanted to do the same thing. When I was in school, the school magazine did an article on teen pregnancy and some girls at school that had kids. They actually quoted a girl as saying, "I thought it would be much harder than it actually is." Basically telling other students that it's not as hard to have a kid in school as everyone makes it sound! My dad was so mad and he wanted to go public with it because he said it glorified teen pregnancy. I agree with him!|`|DNygQdmVaa	No but ive seen similar stuff.  it makes me sick.|`|jiF56lRaaa	i understand we you are coming from but some girls at the age of 16 end up getting pregnant and take good care of there baby. and alot of people are putting them down. i can see that is a young age but if she is able to take care of her baby and become a mature women and take care of her respondsibilties then i dont think they should be put down for no reason.   not everybody is perfect in this world not even you. not being rude but its true not everybody can do everything right all there life you mess up in your life and some times its a good thing cause it will change your life. i got pregnant at 16 but i wasnt trying to. and before i got pregnant i smoked ciggerets and drank and smoked weed but  i wasnt having sex all the time i got pregnant from the man i have only ever had sex with. and anyways we changed our life around quick and know we are married and have a beutiful son and a great life drug free smoke free enviroment and i think if it wasnt for him then i would still be there doing those things but i have another one on the way a lil girl my son is going on two and my baby girl is due in april. but we have a wonderful life its not perfect but it is good. and i was just trying to let you know dont put all the young teen mothers down cause there is some of us that can handle and take care of ourselves and kids. and i am not saying yes all teens should go out and get pregnant it is easy and it will change your life. what i am trying to say is stop putting the teen mothers down that are great mothers. we are normal humans like everyone else.|`|sA1ztaEpaa	No, I've never seen it. But I do think they're IDIOTIC! And to the person who said that a teen mom said it's easier than she thought.. I don't know what in God's name that girl is talking about. It's hard! Soo hard to be a mom, especially a teenage one. It's not something young girls should try to achieve. I was with my now husband for a year when I got pregnant.. and I was taking birth control. Now we're married with a one month old daughter. I don't at all think young girls should TRY to get pregnant.. Wanting a baby is one thing, that's womanly instinct.. TRYING is completely different.. when you're a teenager.|`|xMy0QEvFaa	There's was this one Tyra episode on the other day that I just so happened to watch.    Their was a 15 year old trying to get pregnant and she was taking pills to help her have a baby, she got them off the internet with her mom's card and she upped her does to twice a day.    Can you believe that?|`|200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	I wanted to tell the parents to stop being bullied by their kids and actually discipline them. Give them the true resources of what it is like to raise a child.    A friend of mine was 14 and was trying to get pregnant. Her mom found another teen mom (who was 17 with an infant and a 2 year old).      For a whole week, my friend had to watch both children 24/7.  Attend school.  The kicker, her mom would not financially support and her bf broke up with her when she said she needed financial help that week! (his excuse was "this is stupid and lame. Not my kids anyways")......gave her an eye opener of how quick he can leave her while she is the one stuck with the responsibility.    So, she had to figure out how to clothed them, feed them (infant was breast feed too, so the mom had to pump that week and educate my friend on breastfeeding and the demands of it!), do her school work, have a job, have a babysitter while job/school (2 year old was originally in pre school, which cost $150 a week).     She got smart really quick!    Lets say she missed 3 days of school. She gave the babysitter an IOU and no place would hire her due to her age alone.       Parents have to step up and teach their children to extreme measures. Not sit there, complain and cry.  Get up and do something about it.    Another thing I want to slap is also the education system. Not the teachers, but the actual government (Like Past Pres. Bush) who is for abstiance only education.     Give them sex education for peak sake.
AA11607216	I feel like it's sad that we have become a society that wants to put children into little categories a little too quickly these days.  Sometimes knowledge is not power I'm afraid; knowledge and over-analyzing every little thing with children can be crazy making for parents!  While it is important to diagnose early and get a jump on behavior and mental health issues with children, it is also important to understand that they all develop at different speeds and they all have their strengths and weaknesses.  There are very famous and successful people in this world who have overcome learning disabilities.  There are many adults walking this earth today, who were given little chance of surviving, much less thriving when they were babies.  While I'm not suggesting that we should be less diligent at getting medical care for our children, I do believe that we need to recognize that it's okay if our babies don't follow 'the developmental milestone' books to the letter.  Take time to just simply enjoy your babies and children - rejoice in every smile and giggle and their laughing eyes.  Cuddle and hug and kiss and crawl around the floor, and roll a ball to them and sing - sing a lot!  Make your home a happy place, not a kid laboratory or clinic.  Please - they are only little for such a short time...Don't let the naysayers tell you because of one little idiosyncrasy that it means your child will have 'problems'.  You and your child will be happier for it. I grew up with a brother who had Down's Syndrome - he was profoundly retarded.  He was also loving and kind and giggled a lot and it was painstaking to teach him even the little things.  He is gone now, but he was put here for a reason and I loved him very, very much.  So, do what you need to do for your child's health and well-being, but just be a loving parent and let the chips fall where they may.  Don't make it all about the 'disabilities and deformities'.  Celebrate the fact that we are all different and have challenges - and we all have something to offer in this life.  God Bless...|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	My son does have Autism. I was actually offended when you made the statement "dont fall into this autism crap that people want to throw at u.." as I am sure other parents of autistic children will be. Autism isn't crap, it's a disability with no cause and no cure. Autism is so common right now, 1 in 150 children have it.     Don't knock it until you have dealt with it first-hand.    ETA: I would also like to add that there is a vast range of the severity of autism. My son has many of the autistic traits, except that he is affectionate. There are others that are not affectionate at all. There are other that speak poorly and other that don't speak at all.    ETA: I just wanted to clarify that it is not crap. Sorry if i did take it out of context. Yes there could be dozens of other reasons why a child might not be talking properly, but with this epidemic of Autism lately, I think that's why it's the first thing out of people's mouths. It may not be what's wrong, but it's a possibilty.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I don't know, perhaps because autism isn't always that bad and it's less offensive then telling you your child is developmentally delayed or retarded.    My oldest is developmentally delayed, he isn't potty trained nor does he feed himself all the time, and until very recently he could not dress himself (he's 4).   It's hard to admit there is something wrong with your child, or that they are not normal - he's plenty smart and there is some evidence he is borderline autistic (it's a  spectrum disorder with very high functioning and very poor functioning in that category), but what is wrong with him doesn't make him autistic it just hints that he might be.   I think that kids are much more varied in skill acquisition then we realize, and normal isn't set in stone - I think for example that my son will be potty trained before kindergarten, he simply is slow to gain some of the skills that most kids get.   It's not until kids are finished with brain growth and body growth that you can really tell if they are okay or nor, before then they're just unfinished.|`|DNygQdmVaa	people just say something to be saying it.  you gotta ignore the bad that you get with the good.|`|d43e96506445ef1b6b4ace4380a9a5b4aa	because most of them are too lazy to work with their kids to teach them and would rather blame it on some learning disorder that they can sweep under the rug and do nothing about.|`|AA10186411	No idea.  But I think it shouldn't even be considered unless the child is withdrawn and doesn't communicate with parents.  If its just because he/she isn't crawling on time, or isn't saying a variety of words at a specific time, then you shouldn't try to blame it on autism!|`|wJtm5krFaa	People are quick to try and diagnose a kid with autism (even some doctors are!)    In general, people think they know everything.. lol|`|xRiQUZt5aa	Because saying that doesn't require the poster to think!|`|3d7413e991732aa7cbba574864c37217aa	Yeah, it does annoy me. The whole syndrome of "diagnosing disorders" for every little thing drives me up the wall, actually.     So maybe the child does roughly fit a description of a "condition" called "autism" -- but that's not a solution, it's just a pointer towards some strategies for coping with a problem. Just saying "get him diagnosed" is about pathologizing behavior and personality, to relieve responsibility for any problems that come up, more than it is about solving problems. People who are labeled autistic still have to learn to cope, same as if you didn't blame it on a disorder. The idea that it is a disorder is just a paradigm, and a bad one generally IMHO because the implication is that if it were "just how you are" and not a "disorder," then it would somehow be a bad thing you were doing to be how you are. Ick|`|Y5c4uZ4Maa	I think people are just trying to help you figure it out for yourself, giving you options to ask your childs doctor, because they are not there with the child, they can only make opinions on what they are reading from the question asked. There are so many different reasons children act out, that the doctors try to come up with an answer for everyone, but I think as a mother of three, the way you see your child is what matters most, and if you do see a problem then, maybe bringing up to your doctor is the best way to go.|`|OlPwUM8aaa	I think that the medical profession has started to diagnos many of childrens little problems as autism just like many children can be hyperactive and are now being diagnosed with ADD or ADHD and placed on ridalin. Its not the parents, who should we trust we were conditioned to trust docotors nurses etc what they say it is, it must be right. I have my own personal belief and some may disagree but the children these days are not like the ones of our generation we ran and played outside all day interacting with others now they interact with the television x box etc. Is that the parents fault obviously not!!! When we were young it was safe to play outside now the world is a hairy scary place sending our precious babies outside is not as safe as it once was and It has been proven that the diagnosis of autism FASD ADD and ADHD have all sky rocketed in conjunction with our inactivity. Running and physical exertion is proven to help rejuvinate the brain increase learning and cognitive abilities and alleviate some learning disabilities.  Look up Katherine Dedyna's Article Times Colonist "Run to ease alcohol's toll: Research shows fetal damage may be reduced.  Now im not saying any of us parents drank but In the braoder spectrum im sure it can be related to many developmental delays. So part is that our babies are unable to heal themselves through play and part is the laziness of the medical establishment to help find answers and and part is that many children do have delays, disabilites etc. But I have been to many Schizophrenia meetings over the past few years and many schizophrenics have taken ridalin, ritalin so parents please please look for any alternative to this drug

lO2Nvj81aa	I have never allowed our newborn babies to sleep in their own rooms in the beginning.  For our boys, we had their crib in our bedroom for the first four weeks.  By that time they were sleeping through the night so we moved them into their own rooms.    We have a one-month-old baby girl right now and she sleeps for six-hour stretches through the night, but not all the way through till morning yet.  She is still sleeping in our room.  I just wouldn't be comfortable with her sleeping so far away from me...  As for your husband's alarm, I wouldn't worry about it.  My husband has his set on that horrible beeping sound and he also does the "several times snooze hitting" thing and the alarm has yet to wake up the baby.    As for the baby sleeping in your bed, I am not a fan of that.  It's too dangerous.|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	Well my husband and I sleep with our little guy but sometime we put him in his crib in our room for better sleep. We are always really n guard not to crush him , so you can imagine that our sleep isnt very good.     We are both snorers so it doesnt bother the baby. and it wont because believe it or not she has heard it already.  BUT the alarm will wake her.      so I think you are right, you can also get a camera toactually watch the baby.     werent not in a rush to get our little guy out. but if your not comfy, dont start    we have this one and it works great  http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...|`|0ca6f6ce6afa279f3ccc449197fd3d7daa	well maybe just start off with baby in your room and see how it goes and if it is unworkable then move the baby into the next room. babies like to be near there mama. the baby might feel lonely in the next room by him/herself.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	all three of mine slept our bed until they started crawling and I never had any problems, but if you have concerns about the baby's safety in your bed thats a different story. Try the nursery see how that works and go from there.|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	Nope - I am on your side.  My husband wants our baby to be in our bedroom too - I want him to be in his nursery across the house and keep tabs on him because someone gave us a video baby monitor and we can see every move he will make, as well as hear him.    hubby gets up at 4am and turns a lot of lights on - our baby will be up at 4 with him and so will I.    Put your foot down - you and the baby need the rest and don't need to be awaken by loud music at 5am.|`|71rbASlBaa	my baby sleeps through anything! why not keep the baby is your room for convenience for just a few monthsand then transition into the nursery|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Your baby will sleep fine in your room, and you should never "play quiet" near a sleeping baby!  They sleep through everything, they say the womb is 3X's as loud as a vacuum, and they sleep fine in there!  Having her sleep in your room for the first 6 months of life, also greatly reduces the risk of SIDS, and you don't have to go running to her room a bunch of times to feed her!  Believe me it's a lot easier, I think you should have her in your room!    I had my little girl in a bassinet next to my bed, and at four months, she is now in her crib in my room!  I think you'll both sleep a lot better that way!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	In my experience, the best-laid plans don't necessarily have any bearing on what you're actually going to do when the baby is here.  My husband and a friend reorganized our entire apartment the week after the baby was born -- changed our living room into our bedroom, etc.  It's really hard to know.  We thought we had it set up right, and then realized it was totally unworkable.    I'd start with the baby in the room.  You have this insane urge to have them near you when they are first born.  Then see how it goes.  If it's not working you'll know soon enough.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Babies are able to sleep through all sorts of noises. They don't need to be in a quiet room.    But the choice is really yours.  Keeping baby in your room during the early months is more convenient, since you don't have to get up and walk down the hall for those frequent night feeds. (And they WILL be frequent).  But if you're willing to get up and go to her when she needs you, then she can sleep in her own room.     (You ARE wise to not co-sleep with a hubby who is very deep sleeper.)|`|dRd5d6Bgaa	First of all, you want your child to get use to loud sounds (snoring, alarm clocks) because it'll help your child farther down the road. A lot of times, when there's loud noises babies tend to sleep deeper. I wouldn't worry about the loud noises, she'd get use to it real fast.   If you feel that she belongs in the nursery which is only the room next to yours and you're using a monitor, then why not take advantage of it?   As a side note, before my daughter was born my husband use to snore a lot. When my daughter was born though, his insticts kicked in real fast and he doesn't snore half as bad as he use to...he was actually more alert. Good luck!|`|a0e64779677c884ea4ca4c17390ea954aa	This is a great topic.. You don't realize it yet but the next big discussion that you and your hubby will have about this will probably be when to move the baby out of the bedroom.    Wait till the baby is born for this , but have her nursery ready anyway at least for her clothes and changing table etc.   Best of luck and don't worry about noise|`|EHY3FnAmaa	I prefered my baby in the room with us while being a newborn. I did not want him out of my sight.    As for all the night time feedings with a newborn pretty much every 2 hours. It was just easier having her in our room.    Although I dont see a problem her being in her crib since her bedroom is right next to yours and with a baby monitor. If you could sleep, I would have been too worried to get any sleep as I was checking on my little guy frequently with him beside me.|`|AA10091300	Absolutely not! It isn't good to start baby off in your room at any cost! You will have to put your foot down on this one too and set the baby monitor on his side...baby in Nursery.|`|tdHIR9cLaa	WELL..... i so think if you start the baby out in a loud environment then she will (get used to it) my son can sleep through anything and he is 4 months... if you tip toe around your baby then you are never going to get anything done.ie  normal house work.... ect...     but if you really want your daughter to sleep in the nursery then have her sleep in the nursery. after all you are her momma! and those motion sensors rock so do what you feel is right...    good luck. and hope you have a smooth labor|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	It's actually not a bad thing to get your child used to sleeping through loud noises.  When my kids would fall asleep I would turn the radio or tv up, not down.  Now my kids are very sound sleepers and sleep through almost anything-including LOUD thunderstorms that wake me up!  You can always move the baby out in 5 wks when his alarm starts going off again, but you are going to want the baby close to you because waking up to feed the baby in the middle of the night is difficult, and dragging yourself into another room to do it is often even more difficult.    However, you need to do what is right for you and your husband, the movement sensors sometimes go off for no reason and will cause you to panic every time:(    Good luck and congrats!|`|iuY0sIL9aa	The snoring may not bother the baby.   I'd make a compromise - for the first couple of weeks, have the baby in the same room.  Then, move to the room next door, with the monitors.    For the first few weeks it will be convenient to have the baby in the same room when it wakes up every few hours for feeding.  After a while, the protective/newness will wear off and being in the room next door will be more tolerable.|`|mCDopsLEaa	I think you are being very reasonable. Not only for safety, but have you seen some questions on here?? A lot of moms are trying to get their toddlers to sleep in their own beds and the toddlers refuse because they slept in the bed/in the room with their parents. The parents never get "alone time" when the child is in the room as well. Just tell him you won't be able to have sex if she is in there. Maybe that will work. LOL, JK.....  The alarm clock thing is a good argument. I hope you two can work through it and come to a compromise, but I'll be rooting for you.    As far as the noise is concerned it is actually good to get the baby used to noises, otherwise you will never be able to accomplish anything.

They couldn't tell me either because it was so low, that it was obvious that it was on its way back down.     But its safe to say that you were at least about a month. Seeing that your HGC levels were just a little lower than an average woman's at a month.     I'm very sorry that you had a miscarriage. God bless you!
AA11537248	My kids' eyes changed at around 6 months.|`|dRd5d6Bgaa	My daughter is almost 16 months old and her eyes still haven't gotten to the color they're going to be. Her eyes are a green color, but other days they're really brown.|`|sAhAEC2qaa	how do you know they are going to be brown?|`|3MelQFxOaa	First let me say, I have brown eyes, the father has brown eyes, my dad has blueish eyes, and the fathers dad has blueish eyes. My daughters eyes are starting to change color, and they look blue. The brown gene is dominate, but if you have two recessive genes (blue) they become dominate. So you could have a blue eye baby, but I agree, that you will probably have brown eye baby.   Anyways, it generally takes up to a year. Thats what my doctor told me, and my daughter is almost 8 months old, and she is just starting to change color.|`|zJHrFBtNaa	approx. 12months|`|JBRmTDgbaa	6 months-  at least that's what my childs pediatrician told us.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Any time up to a year!|`|5prmKXELaa	=)
rXY5ntnMaa	My son is doing the same thing.  This is what I do.  I nurse him at breakfast than give him his cereal.  If he seems happy than I let him be, if not I top him off with a 4 oz. bottle of formula. At luch he gets 7 oz. of formula than food. Supper I nurse than feed him than top him off.  I hope this helps.    4 to 5 times a week he gets up at night than I nurse him and he goes to bed again.  On these days I give him formula for breakfast and supper and lunch let him nurse.  Good luck|`|AA11113606	I just pump once in the morning and get an 8 ounce bottle, then I feed my seven month old 3 bottles of formula for the remainder of the day.  Works well for us, and is similar to your morning feeding.|`|iFAlZfVMaa	you may need to try a different pump... for a week I used and HATED the Medela pump.      I got a little AVENT hand pump and, OMG.... it was like I'd gotten totally new boobs... it was probably the same amt as my daughter was nursing!!       as for rebuilding your supply, it can be done... contact your local LA Leche League... these ladies can work wonders!    http://www.llli.org/|`|mGubEYTRaa	Yes, definately start formula until at least 12 months.    Have you tried pumping?  Or are you completely dried up?
J6IOqzL0aa	lol i just had this vision of him waiting in bed staring at his watch counting the minutes waiting for you to get off YA and get on with it loool.  It took us about 7 weeks as well because to be perfectly honest i love my husband to bits but i need my sleep at the moment. My little man gets me up at least 3 times a night at the mo and really doesnt nap much in the day so i need any rest i can get. Poor hubby!!!|`|4ksa4lhWaa	Wait 6 - 8 weeks,  It hurt me I did it at 5 weeks and it hurt.  Doc said wait till after the post doc visit to make sure everything is ok down there.|`|bd22ca32eb55bc06eaa923b22bd0e54aaa	6 weeks. I had a bad tear so i wanted to wait until my 6 week appointment. my appt. just happened to be on my husband's birthday, so of course he was thrilled! It didn't hurt.|`|hGqQIusSaa	I waited until my 6 week checkup with the doctor, when I had my Mirena put in!     I was not taking any chances!!  It was still uncomfortable even after that long, but it's gotten better.|`|qUImmXXEaa	Hey! 6 weeks for us!!! It was fine!!! I had a planned c-section by the way!!!    Have fun!!! ;-)|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	1 1/2 weeks after a c-section. Didn't hurt at all..in fact it was better than before!|`|ctUG4BXfaa	LOL. I had a C-Section and my hubby and I only waited 2 1/2 weeks, but I was in and out of the hospital due to high blood pressure 2 weeks before and it had been a month and a half since we had sex! No it didnt hurt at all.. WITH A SECTION... I have never had a natural birth.|`|5DJcir9saa	It was at about 6 weeks after.  I had to have a c-section so I was more nervous about the incision opening than anything.  I know thats a bit ridiculous but it still made me nervous.  Other than that, everything was fine.  Its just like riding a bike...  :D|`|TZ4mbFh3aa	4 weeks after...I would have earlier but I had a c-section|`|7XuzRloXaa	After our first child, we tried fairly soon...BIG MISTAKE!  But after having our second baby 5 months ago, I think it was about 5-6 weeks when we went ahead. It didn't hurt, just wasn't as pleasurable..most likely b/c I was just thinking all those "what if's."|`|AA10207874	2 weeks and mainly because I had a c-section and my vagina wasn't sore.|`|aomiDjzvaa	well it's a very personal decision cuz only you know your body... We started having sex after 4 weeks.. But I had a csection.. If I had a vb I would have waited for doc to give me the go... We had sex the morning of my csection and after waiting four weeks I felt like a virgin all over again.. Keep doin those kegals n he will nOtice! Breastfeeding however will take away from your wetness per say so a lubrication my be fun! Goodluck!|`|WlU3NFu6aa	6 weeks. and I had a c section so everything was fine down there. But I had dilated so I was bleeding and I was so dang tired!|`|ggETPqedaa	Nearly two months actually, I had a c-section and I am still a tiny bit sore still. That and I wanted my sleep, he started sleeping somewhat through the night. Would get up around 5 am, so instead of five hours of sleep, I would only get four if I had sex. Hopefully soon it will be back to normal.|`|bVRgrvDbaa	we waited 5 weeks. My hubby couldn't wait the full 6 weeks. It did feel uncomfertable. No pain though. Although, the uncomfertness lasted for about 6 months before it began to feel "normal" again!|`|X6as2nOAaa	I waited until she was about 4 months old just because he was a ex|`|zwctZ812aa	I waited 7 weeks and it was quite painful.  It's been 13 weeks now and it still hurts.  I didn't have any stitches or tears or anything, but it just isn't the same still.  Everyone is different, hopefully it will be better for you!|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	i waited five weeks which is when i felt good and ready. and it was perfect lol :)|`|DNygQdmVaa	I had sex 2 weeks later, i know your suppose to wiat 6 weeks,  and yes it hurt, just a little bit.|`|9X09kM4oaa	My daughter is almost 3 months old and I haven't had sex yet- I want to but I had a very painful traumatic pregnancy- I had pre- eclampsia and had to be in the hospital for 5 weeks and was being induced for 3 days (very painful) then I had a c-section. But I want to have sex but I am scared to get pregnant again.|`|wKYdIaZVaa	4 weeks... I had a c-section. Yeah you're supposed to wait 6 weeks but I felt great... and I'm still here... I wouldn't say it hurt (more like a tad bit uncomfortable). I had sex throughout my entire pregnancy so waiting those 4 weeks was actually a very long time.. LOL    Best of luck tonight!|`|xcPghcw9aa	You are good to go, I know this is like a WOW thing for you to hear from me but after we had our baby, we haven't had any for going about 8 months already. yeah that's sad.|`|nhgQKvwEaa	I was 4 weeks with my first, and 3 with my second. a little early i know. but i was no longer bleeding, and felt like i was ready. It didn't hurt, just felt weird.|`|7bTOY5vHaa	I waited for 8 weeks after my first because that's when I stopped bleeding. Then my second we only waited 3 weeks. If you feel like everything is ok down there then go for it, just take it slow at first and if it doesn't feel right then stop and try again a few days later. All women are different so it could still hurt or it may not even bother you at all.|`|cCRXxCASaa	I had sex four weeks after my son was born I had vaginal delivery with no tearing it didn't feel uncomfortable at all|`|cYRZpGkqaa	I waited six months. After all I went through with the birthing process it was hard to view myself as a sexual being again (and colic most certainly did not get me in the mood!) It wasn't so much of a choice per say, it's just how it happened. Since I waited so long it was slightly uncomfortable because the scar from the episiotomy (SP?) toughened up a bit. Good luck!|`|B1JFBV3jaa	2 weeksafter vaginal delivery.  It was wonderful although I spotted for a couple days after due to the lack of activity for a couple weeks.  ENJOY! :-)    Why the thumbs down just because I didn't wait FOREVER to make love to my man again?  Everything healed and was back to normal within two weeks.  I wasn't about to wait another 4 weeks (unnecessarily) just to meet the doctors requirements.  I'm in touch with my body and know when it's okay.  Besides, I had sex the day I was induced.  Two weeks was PLENTY long enough.  I actually enjoy making love to my honey.|`|g0xjN9E6aa	I didn't have sex until my daughter was three months old because I had  a very severe tear. I thought I was all healed up, and had the okay from the doctor. It still hurt and we waited a couple more weeks before doing it again. Everything is fine now (daughter is 6 months old) and back to normal.
MCTyWCu2aa	5 days before your missed period. The new ones can tell if your ph level is high enough.|`|QB5D0rG4aa	I would wait until you miss your period to take a test. Alot of the times the hpt can't read the hormone in your body before you get your period. Good luck !|`|ostF23Omaa	save your money wait till you have missed your period and then take a pt.  Good Luck|`|LpoeleVOaa	I knew exactly the day I conceived and I found out when I was 11 days. I had a blood test taken and It came back positive on the 11th day. My urine test did not come back positive until the 13th day.|`|dJpBszAraa	take a blood test its the best way to go if you really wanna know asap!|`|a6103b5448a81b3f2d761f035154c522aa	Don't try to find out too early.  A lot of the tests will pick up on a 'bad' pregnancy that the body will reject.  The safer route is to wait until your period is late instead of testing early.
GGH0HVdvaa	Well, for me, my husband and I would just sit down with my parents and say "We're pregnant!" Cue tears of joy and hugs all around.    But I'm guessing you are just young girls so I guess there's no better way than just spitting it out and getting the telling out of the way. The sooner she tells the better because she's going to need all the help she can get. and you too.|`|KdCzS5Q4aa	I was there with my little (14-year-old) sister when she told our mam she was pregnant. So if your friend has an older sibling or someone that could help her out. She told our mam (our dad had just died a month before so the timing couldn't have been worse!) that she was sorry and that she'd stupidly gotten herself pregnant. She kept saying she was stupid and saying she sorry. She was terrified! It's natural for your friend to be scared as well. Is your friend keeping the baby? If she doesn't know, her parents would help her decide. Her parents, naturally won't exactly take it the best, so let her be warned, but will eventually have to deal with it, there's nothing they can do, what's done is done.  Good luck to your friend!|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	I would say....    "Guys, I'm pregnant. I made an adult decision and now I have to deal with the consequences as an adult. I need all of the support I can get and I intend to do well."    Something like that...I wouldn't cry either, I would look a little upset...but not bawling my eyes out.|`|f3LrMhqWaa	well i wouldn't have gotten pregnant in the first place!!!!you should both tell your parents- what if anything happens to your baby and you have to go to hospital and then your parents find out?wouldn't that be worse?|`|UVblLg4naa	Well, at least you're both in the same boat.  I'd hate to be in a situation like that alone, and a lot of people are.  I think you two need to stick up for each other.  You can tell your parents together. She could be there for moral support when you tell your parents, and you could be there for her when she tells hers.|`|dPULl5hjaa	flat out say it - you already screwed up your life|`|ZSEBueCbaa	Your both knocked up?!    She has to tell them sometime because it will start to show and they will guess from the change in behaviour and the morning sickness. You got yourself in that situation, so you need to sort it out. Just tell your friend to sit down with her parents and calmly explain the situation.|`|641ef355c3ba077004c47f9ce2106922aa	I would tell them I'm an idiot and a mother to be to it. They will quite rightfully tell me that I am a little tart, and an idiot, but good parents are supportive parents. Honesty is the right approach.|`|c3b0303b45fbe6430dc388e695c7e5eaaa	Just sit them down tell them she has something to tell them, they`ll guess anyway, I did with my daughter, she should say she needs their support while she decides what to do, hopefully she`ll get the right support from them, It`s scary, I know, but she will get through it lots of girls do,|`|VbUpMxrvaa	You just have to tell them.  Lol..there's no easy way.  Every day matters in a pregnancy  & they know a lot more than you..or your friend or whoever.  So just tell them and get it over with.|`|4KHDjq62aa	First of all does your parents know that your sexually active because that could be a lot for a parent to take in. I would start off talking about something thats totally off topic to lighten the coversation, anf then tell them.|`|WtTAwD4kaa	I would tell them by say how sorry I am. Then I would let them know that there is no more help for me cause the father left. I believe that they would understand. Parents care too much to not help you.|`|zvvNRg7Faa	u sohuld not say!u r young!|`|DYdXrVVeaa	dont tell them|`|W8gKP5h8aa	you sound pretty young and stupid so i'm going to say watch juno|`|sA1ztaEpaa	"Mom, Dad, I'm pregnant"    Email me, I'm a 16 year old mom of a 1 month old daughter. I don't want to explain my story on a public question board, but I'll tell you what ended up happening with me. My parents didn't find out until I was 32 weeks (8 MONTHS)      EDITED TO ADD:    I am also now married to my baby's father, so please, no hate mail or "hate answers."  =)|`|Vo38ccPOaa	First of all is she's still not sure of whether she's pregnant of not she should wait and be sure about it before making a worst mistake. But is she is pregnant I would tell my parents straight up have her tell the parents who is softer and that would help her tell the other parent. But in my opinion she should tell them what she did and how she feels I think it is better to let them know herself than them finding out later. Most importantly tell them that she needs all the support that she can get.|`|m9aggkGaaa	I told my mom I was pregnant over the phone...  A bit of a different situation, as I was grown up and living on my own, but it still seemed like the easiest (and unfortunately the most cowardly) way.  Your friend (and you) could consider writing your parents a letter, or asking another adult, like a school counselor, doctor, or pastor to help you break the news.    It's very important that you and your friend both tell your parents so they can help you get set up with an ob-gyn (vital for you and the baby to get proper healthcare), plus give you emotional support and help you decide what you're going to do with the baby.      I had a friend who got pregnant in high school and kept it a secret from her parents... until she was 6 months along and passed out one day.  Then her parents had to find out from an ER doctor, which didn't help the situation.|`|758cDKEFaa	im 17 and 14 weeks and 4 days with my second baby.  the first time i got pregnant i told my parents when i was out one night by a text message then turned my phone off so i give it a few hours then went back after my parents had time to calm down and think about everything.  this time i got my sister to tell them, either way worked very well for me.  i think that you should tell your parents concidering how far along you are, you'll need to start preparing and the soooner they know the sooner they can help you and get used to the idea.  as for your friend, i wouldnt bother telling them until she is certain she is pregnant, if she gets a positive test result she should tell them then rather than possibly scaring her parents about nothing and they will worry about what shes doing from that day onwards.|`|LZ4QYrPXaa	is she close with her mother?   Its just i told my mum that i was late and she told me not to worry and just wait it out...2 weeks later i told her i still hadn't come on and she said to take a test...she didn't think i was it was just to be sure an when it came out pos...it wasn't as much of a shock to her as it would have been if i hadn't told her that there may be some chance that i am.    So if she sits down with her and says that she is worried that she might be then she will feel alot better!|`|L4Bnecwoaa	I think first of all uv got to know what u want to do before u speak to them, cos they're probs going to want to discuss it with u and discuss ur options.  Or on the other hand if u dont know what to do, u just need to go to them and tell them ur pregnant and ask for their help.     i dont think there is a good way to tell them, u just gotta take a deep breath and say it. hope it goes well for you :)|`|OEW5Y7gNaa	go "err mum and dad ive been so dumb and well im pregnant" see its not hard
pXSKSS3daa	You don't have $25 to buy some formula?    Buy the Parent's Choice brand and mix it into with what you have. It shouldn't give your baby a belly ache if it's mixed in a little. Or ask a friend/family member for a loan until you get paid. Cereal doesn't go in bottles for many reasons and it won't necessarily make your son go longer between feeds.    I'd also consider setting up an emergency fund for cases like this. You also shouldn't rely solely on WIC for your son's formula. In most cases people have to buy extra cans anyway.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	You absolutely should not feed him stage two formula or bulk up his bottle.  Switching brands to a store brand is infinitely less of a bad idea than that.  I don't know why WIC doesn't give moms store brand formula in the first place, frankly.  The fact that they don't give enough seems to be a common concern.|`|rAkWoweOaa	Not a good idea to bulk up on cereal or use stage 2. I know it is expensive, but if you go to similac.com they can send you a $5 off cupon. Using generic will not hurt your baby. It is much better than him going without!|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	Wow...you ladies are VERY rude and judgmental.      First of all, PLENTY OF PEOPLE WITH JOBS QUALIFY FOR WIC.  Get it through your thick skulls.      Second of all, I'm sure even YOU have run out of money at one point in your life.  It's humbling.      Yes., she has been rude in previous questions.  But here is your opportunity to BE THE BETTER PERSON.  By insulting her, you're just doing what you accuse HER of doing.  Maturity is a GOOD THING.  Say it with me...      Call your local food bank and ask if they have formula.  It may not be the brand your baby normally takes, but it's nourishment, and it's only for a few days.      Good luck.|`|h59Bc4wfaa	I don't know your whole story, but a lot of Mommies who get WIC also get food stamps. If this is your case, you CAN buy formula with them. Hope you can get it figured out soon.    Good luck~|`|abaad89210d63dec4904f2e85346439caa	go on craigslist or freecycle to find free or cheap formula.  Also, call 2-1-1 for community resources to help you find formula and other things you may need.  Try churches as well.  And a really good place for formula, ask your child's pediatrician for sample cans.  My child's doc always hooked us up big time.  One time she gave me 15 8oz powder cans of formula.  Another time she gave me a whole case of 12.9oz cans of formula.|`|MCTyWCu2aa	Why dont you get a job and not relay on are taxes to pay for your own child.|`|wKYdIaZVaa	For someone who always has so many negative things to say about other mothers, you seem to be in quite a predicament.     If I was you, I'd ask someone for a favor and have them buy the formula.  The stage 2 is also going to mess with his tummy and feeding him food isn't going to make the formula last longer. Next time, explain to wic when they make your appointment that you need it earlier in the month to make sure you have the formula needed to feed your son.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	Breasts never run out of milk!  But seeing as how that isn't an option right now, I say you just get a couple of little cans of ready-mix stuff|`|ZusC87WBaa	You really have to plan ahead for these things.  You will probably need to buy some formula every month anyway, so be prepared.  Have you called WIC and explained your situation?  They should be able to at least print you off one coupon to use until your appointment.|`|9de230e5b3f196d4083653e2703f4b13aa	What!  are you serious?  As the baby gets older WIC wont hold you over through the whole month.  You will have to buy some.  Call wic tell them they need to get you in NOW.  And in the mean time you need to find a job.  Ask a friend if you can borrow a few bucks to hold you over, but feeding your baby is not an option.  AND NO you cant change between the types of formula you feed your baby.  If he's on similac thats what he needs.  and similac 2 depends on what age he is.  He CAN NOT just have cereal, he needs milk.  This is so disturbing to me, your baby needs a mother that can provide for him, and if you can't then there are responsible people out there that would love to have a child.  That's the harsh reality|`|l5A9QXVzaa	Sweetie the main difference between the store brand and the name brand is the label. Buy one can of the store brand until you can go to your WIC appointment. From now on, I would keep an emergency stash if I were you. Hope you have enough to eat also.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	When i had my children,they didn`t have store brand formula. I wish they had. Similac was really expensive, especially the Lactose free kind. If your child doesn`t have any dietary issues, why not switch to store brand like the other folks have suggested? Also, perhaps, you may need a part time job to help with your living expenses.Hey, try vitamin supplements, the infant vitamins.    In Canada, women on Mother`s allowance only get $969 a month for everything, ( food, shelter, clothes). It`s hard when you have more than one child. Maybe welfare isn`t the answer.You`re young, you still have the chance to make something of yourself    Call YOUR DOCTORS OFFICE they may have free samples...Mine did, and that will tie you over until you get some coupons|`|AA12057835	checks craigslist for formula.  I buy all of my formula from other mom's who have stocked up and can't use it anymore or have had to switch.  I can buy a $14 can of Similac usually for about $6.|`|mAsQbiIgaa	Ring and explain the situation and make an emergency appointment for tomorrow so you can get your formula. If you explain the situation i am sure they would understand.|`|P16Vu20Haa	How old is your baby?    It shouldn't hurt him to give him the step 2. It's basically the same as regular similac, only it has more iron and calcium to make up for solids.    If you still have a little formula left, go and buy the Walmart brand and mix it in with the similac. You can't let your baby go hungry!!!|`|B1JFBV3jaa	WIC is supplemental.  It shouldn't be expected that they provide ALL of the formula for your child.  What are you going to do as your baby grows and demands more formula?  I doubt they are going to increase your given amount to fit his needs.  Or what about when he starts baby food?  They don't provide that.  I would go ahead and start figuring something out to provide for your child.    But until then, I would say buy a cheap can.  A couple days worth of a new formula shouldn't upset his stomach too bad.  It's better than him going hungry!    Bless your heart...|`|nsTcCQIQaa	You do not need to be giving your baby cereal through a bottle.  Cereal is to be given by spoon only.  cereal through a bottle poses dangerous choking risks.  You need to figure out a way to get your child formula.  I have heard that store brands or almost exactly like some name brands of formula.  If your child doesn't seen to have a sensitive stomach, I would try a store brand.  I did not see the age of your child to tell you if he can be on stage two formula.  The can should have an recommended age on it.  I understand being tight with money and wish the best of luck!|`|ExVvNU8taa	If you cant expect your baby to get the vitamins out of cereal alone then maybe you shouldnt expect the government to provide all your babys formula.|`|dgM66nRBaa	Ask your friends for support! Or family! And if you have to buy and off brand for a couple of days then it will be ok!|`|MkNHpANVaa	do you live in milwaukee wisconsin by any chance, there are many programs provided in my city through food pantry and "hunger task force" just to name one, see if there is anything like that where you can be reffered to, and I'm Sure they will assist, and my wic book gives me an additional number to call as well, so just try a little harder and stop complainig, resources are out there!!!|`|gdlc9Jg4aa	Noah's mommy and marine wife has it right.   Enough said!|`|J6IOqzL0aa	im sorry to say this but i find it really funny how you can preach on and on about babies bottoms and how you are so much better yet you realise at the very last minute you cant afford formula for your child.  I suggest you dont buy yourself any food except some pasta and sauce (ie something v cheap) and live off that for the next couple of days and use the extra money to buy your little one the food he needs!!|`|hW6KrRQQaa	Just because she is on WIC does not mean that she does not have a job.  We do not know the situation so we should not judge.  I personally would not bulk up his formula with cereal.  He needs the nutrients from the formula.  Have you called the pediatrician.  My pediatrician always has samples.  If you call the doctors office and explain your situation they may give you samples to last until your WIC appointment.  If you have to switch formulas it would be better then him not having any.  But I would call the pediatrician first.  From now on put some money aside that is only for your baby.  So if you happen to run out of formula again you will have money to buy more.  Just have a special stash only for that and don't use it for anything else.  Call your pediatrician and let me know how it goes.  Good luck!|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	Noah's Mommy and Chloe's mama have said it right - listen to them.    My son does great on target brand formula.  My doctor recommended it over name brands.|`|BnYrOfYraa	Like others have said, the generic formula should be fine.  Get whatever one says "compared to Similac".  You should NOT give your child stage 2 if they are under the recommended age for that formula.  You also shouldn't be giving him cereal in a bottle, but that's another issue.    If you find yourself in an emergency situation where you have no formula, and cannot afford to buy some, get on the phone and start calling people.  Pediatricians have a lot of formula samples, if your pedi is out, start calling food banks in your area.  If there's no luck there, start calling friends/family and ask them to borrow money to get some formula.  Your baby needs to eat and that is the most important thing.  That comes before bills, gas in the car, rent/mortgage, or food for you.    After this crisis is over, I suggest going over your finances to make sure this situation doesn't happen again.  Like another poster said, start up an emergency fund that you cannot touch.  Stock up extra formula when stores have sales.  Actually, if you have a Target near you, check them out.  They have the value cans of formulas (20% more) that should be 30-50% off by now.  Check the end caps around the store.  Good Luck.|`|Q7jMH5praa	I went through the same thing when my son was first born. Where I was BF and supplementing with formula they only gave me 6 cans for a month. Well BF didn't work out and I was running out of formula so I called up the WIC office and they got me in right away and gave me a voucher for 4 more cans until my next appointment.     Don't listen to all these naysayers. A lot of people just like to talk out of their @sses.
c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	ok, maybe waiting to have sex  until we are married would be a nice things., but in the world we live in an 18 year old having sex is not something she needs to get punished for.. having sex is NOT a BAD thing.. maybe the time and place was wrong, but sex is NOT the enemy..!!!    your niece should not be asking to get punished.. maybe she is doing that thinking it will make her step dad happy and like her again... not that he doesn't, but she may think that...    and for an 18 year to ask for her step dad to spank her is just gross and wrong..|`|f3LrMhqWaa	er, no, she's 18, she's not a child so if he did, he could be charged with assault, so if he wants to end up in court, go right ahead and do it!!|`|GGH0HVdvaa	She's 18, she's too old for a spanking lol. I think she's having punishment enough with the loss of her baby. Or what might have been her baby. It's a really hard thing to go through.
RC5L6AEhaa	Fenugreek herb works great  also talk to your doctor for other. Drink lots of water too    http://www.breastfeeding.com/all_about/f...    http://www.breastfeeding.com/all_about/a...     I wouldn't take any supplements, herbs, or medications without consulting your doctor first|`|WlU3NFu6aa	Supposedly eating oatmeal helps. Drinking lots of water is probably your best bet tho|`|vue9NOhYaa	Oatmeal has a reputation for increasing supply.    But the main thing, if you are concerned about your supply, is to be sure that you are nursing often, and are generally well nourished (getting enough to eat and drink -- though there's no reason to force lots of fluids; beyond a certain point it doesn't  help, and just means you're spending more time on the toilet.).|`|weE5FxCfaa	foods don't matter as much as liquids.  stay really hydrated with plenty of water.  caffeine is bad for hydration so lay of the coffee and soda etc.  also keep taking prenatals until you wean your baby.  i have had 4 and nursed them all over a year|`|nKXTjqQWaa	It's supply on demand. Your baby will get your supply where he needs it. Really you don't want to produce more than he's eating.|`|SaRDq9iLaa	It's supply and demand.  The more your baby drinks or you pump, the more you will make.  Also, drink lots of fluids (water).|`|xRiQUZt5aa	Hmmm ... I don't know that there is one. But I was always told to drink as much as possible to help with milk production.|`|714a3c260d916f907af43aeeb3d020f3aa	FRESH Milk.  beside , in my country, we make soup of rice and pork tenderloin or pork legs, or feet. It helps a lot ( from my self experiment).  Papaya, and some red fruits like pumpkin are also flavored for milk feeding mama.  other things which may dehydrate your body:  caffein, alcohol, must be out of the list...if you prefer the best qualified milk for your honey.|`|g0xjN9E6aa	I was having a breast milk shortage about 2 months ago, and tried EVERYTHING to get my milk back up. My doctor first off, told me to drink A LOT of water. Just keep drinking it continuously. This didn't work as much for me, so then he told me to take Fenugreek supplements, 3 capsules 3 times daily. After 4 days of this, and only a slight improvement, he put me on Reglan 10mg three times a day. After 2 days my milk was overflowing. I stopped taking it and havent had any significant problems with my milk since then. If ever I feel like I am slowing down production, I take one tablet before I go to bed and everything is back to normal.    I wouldnt suggest taking any supplements, herbs, or medications without consulting your doctor first. If you don't need more milk, and just want to be setting more aside, I would say just start off drinking a lot of water. Good luck.|`|HVPIOlwfaa	"More important than what you eat is how your baby eats. When a baby is properly positioned, well-attached and sucking effectively, the longer a baby nurses at your breast the more milk will be produced. This is the single most important way to increase your milk production."    -drinking lots of fluids throughout the day  -Nursing requires about an extra 500 calories per day. So make sure you aren't dieting!!  -Get lots of rest    In terms of foods, and herbs etc here are some things you can try.    -Brown rice  -Beets  -Avocados  -Carrots  -Barley   -Dulse (a red algae high in B vitamins, iron, and potassium.)  -Kumbo (edible kelp rich in glutamic acid)  -Fenugreek   -blessed thistle  (Fenugreek and blessed thistle work quickly. If they do work, you will usually notice a difference within 3 to 4 days of starting taking them. If not, they probably won't work.)    There is also: raspberry leaf, fennel, goat's rue, brewer's yeast, alfalfa, oatmeal, dill.    These are just a few of the things recommended by a number of sources for increasing your milk supply. First you should make sure that you aren't wearing bras that are too small, no sleeping on your stomach (it compresses your breasts), medications such as birth control and antihistamines can affect your milk supply negatively.     I would suggest contacting your local Lactation Consultant to see what may be the problem or what solutions are right for you.    All the best and good luck to you and your babe :)|`|yjXUE8bWaa	Although having a overall balance of all the food groups is best for all of us, the best thing believe it or not, is tuna, carrots and drinking lots of fluids. We here at our house do the "juicing" thing and make cakes and pancakes with the pulp fibers.The juicer unit is not pricey and the cleanup is fairly easy. So I have about three glasses of carrot juice a day (which you don't have to have that much, I just like the taste), eat tuna  three times a week,  and have  10-eight oz. glasses of water a day, your milk production will go way up. Pumping between feedings will also help your body produce more and more. The more you pump or feed, the more you body will start producing. Also there is this tea out there called Yogi tea for nursing moms,100% organic and caffine free the web site is    www.yogitea.com    The ingredients in this tea are as follows: Organic Chamomile flower, Organic Fennel seed,  Organic Stinging nettle leaf, Organic Anise seed,  Organic Fenugreek seed, Organic English lavender flower. The taste is very mild and pleasent.      This tea really stepped up my production, so much so, that I could donate milk to the hospital for others.   (and yes they screen milk donors, just like the blood donors.) Interesting tidbit there, some women don't know you can donate milk too. Blessings to you and yours and I know that these thing will help you. :)     BTW check out this helpful web site on storing breastmilk. :D    http://www.mother-2-mother.com/|`|0OtHu9Zmaa	I was drinking Mothers Milk tea by Traditional Medicinals and really noticed the difference in the milk supply. On the days when I forgot to drink it I had noticeably less milk (and I know because i pumped, so it was easily measurable). There is a lot of controversy about the herbal supplements being healthy or not so healthy for you and your baby. I can only speak from my own experience - I drank this tea almost every day, couple of cups a day. My baby did not have a drop of formula for 8 months, i did not have to substitute, or anything. He is perfectly healthy 1 year old. I am pasting the link to amazon.com where they sell the tea in case you are interested in seeing what the package looks like. I personally was buying it at Whole Foods.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	My mother in law came & helped me when I had my baby girl. She was very excited that I wanted to breastfeed. She told me in the old days, people used to eat lots of meat for breast milk but it's wrong at least for the beginning. She made lots of clear soups for me such as seafood soup, fish soup & seaweed soup.     I think it's genetic that I have lots of milk like my mom because some people just don't have milk no matter what they do. I love soups so it helped I guess.
WI5KmVRdaa	my son goes twice a day and as long as the poo is not watery or very hard it is fine b/c if it is watery it could cause dehydration|`|74pfB2Bnaa	Mine (10month by now) poos between 1 and 5 times a day. She just seems to have a speedy digestion, because she is a rather slender baby.

ZbnxGIsnaa	I'd say anything is possible dear!!! =)  I REALLY HOPE you get pregnant this round.  It's so hard when your hubby has to go somewhere and it leads to less sex when we need to do the dance, but it's also a relief knowing it takes a bit for the sperm to reach the egg.

jdRKZe18aa	I guess that depends on your long term perspective, goals and life view. Mine is primarily FAMILY - they ARE the core of life in my opinion.   I view everything from an eternal perspective whenever possible and with THAT in mind then the shallow, finite, material, short term pleasures & monetary fleeting moments in life really have little importance or significance.      Certainly life as a family, as a parent, as a spouse is HARD work but it is what makes sweet, joyous, meaningful, worthwhile.  Marriage, family, children, grandchildren, our ancestors, our posterity, growing, developing, learning together, unity, THESE are the things that this life is INTENDED to be about in my opinion.  The old saying "you can't take it with you." certainly is applicable with your question, I think.      All the selfish, self gratifying pleasures of life - of comfort, leisure, vacations, no commitments, no ties, no children SOUND lovely when you're in the midst of what is often a very HARD MOMENT as a parent with children - but when you are 60, 70, 80 without those children,without the ties, commitments, loving relationships and treasures memories and moments and find yourself alone, lonely and LOST - then all those selfish pleasures seem rather HALLOW in my opinion.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I did the travelling, being free, partying life when I was in my 20's.  I would imagine that if I had continued doing the same thing through my 30's & 40's, that would have gotten pretty boring.      For me, doing something different with my life made it more interesting altogether.      Once the kids are grown (and, actually, as their needs become less demanding over the years even now when they are not grown), I'm sure I will find new, interesting things to do with my time here.      Making commitments, touching other lives, doing things that make connections & make the world better for others - IMHO, that's what makes an interesting life.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	You simply can't explain what a child you love brings to a person. Your whole perspective on life changes. There is no amount of freedom or money that can bring that to you.|`|3a8d8200494dea80c8e22d328cd4879aaa	That is the ultimate question. Some people are happy without children their whole lives. Some people don't feel complete unless they have children. It really depends on the person.    I'm not a parent, but I've heard parents say that there's nothing harder yet more rewarding than raising a child. Once you have a child, your world will stop revolving around you and your partner and revolve only around the little one. Things that you were able to do before will be limited or non-existant, but can be replaced by other activities as a family. You kind of live a second life through your child.    It's one of the hardest changes a person goes through. One of the things that blows my mind is that once you have a kid, you'll never stop worrying about them, even when they're an adult. Because they'll always be your child. That level of emotional and spiritual attachment is pretty scary but can also be very rewarding. That's life!|`|uP08b6K4aa	When you make the decision to have children, everything else goes out the window, holidays, nights out etc.  That's not to say they stop completely but you put your children first.    Children are time consuming, expensive, and stressful!  But I wouldn't be without mine for all the heartache they can cause not to mention sleepless nights, they're a blessing.    When the time is right you'll know whether you're ready or not.    Good Luck x|`|4gZYucHMaa	There are those who are made to be a momma and there are those who are not.

It means more than any job I have ever been paid to do.  It is more rewarding than any goal I have ever set for myself.  I love my children and wouldn't trade them for anything in this world.|`|cteyFJxhaa	Well I spent 20 of my first 37 years raising my son and I promise you it was never, ever boring.

ahjqc9Ifaa	My daughter is 24 now and was just over visiting. (She's a grad student and her class was canceled.) We never went through a period like that, and she knows a number of other young women who also never did, although it seems like they're a small minority.    So it's not a done deal. As she matures--and has moments of astonishing immaturity and selfishness--be careful not to judge or condemn. Pick your fights and concede with grace when it's not worth the argument. Be the person she can talk to about anything, and that means keeping a secret from even her dad, much less her friends and yours.    Our daughter goes to school here because it was one of the best two acceptances she got, and because I live here. That's pretty cool, IMO.|`|ABvw9Ocoaa	i knew a kid that did not so much as look at his mom for three years.   yes it will happen just be careful with the punishments. my sister was punished once and she tried to kill herself. punish her no doubt but make sure she doesnt do any thing drastic. if things get so bad, pray that it wont, look up the web site www.crosscreekprograms.com.  if she does get bad and really bad like i got threaten a few times ever show the web site. if nothing change you will have no changes.    now i am not trying to scare you here i am just giving the options to someone that may need them. now a days kid are drinking, smoking in bathrooms, and dealin drugs on campus. i have seen it all. i was invited to a bar party once. just inform her of all the possibilities.    i was like she is now and i said i would never be that stupid, then look at where i went. a program for troubled teens.|`|A6rZIwAbaa	well...according to my experience i am 19 nw..you should not try to be over friendly with your kid as he is growing up make him feel like an adult do not inter faree too much in its matters ya do give him correct guidence when he ask you or when he need you but he is not an kid anymore so behave like an adult to him and give him space and try to be his friend too things will be fine than......|`|KZc5Ly4Yaa	Hi. Well i'm a mom of 6 kids! and 3 of them are already out of the house.     I have two sets of twins all girls and they are 18 & 14.     I noticed with my 18 year olds before they left they did get a little bit of a attitude if i were to ask them a simple question such as.   example: did you talk with Jason today? and they would have a attitude like that was such a terrible question!         I now understand i was asking to many questions and feeding off of them for what i thought interesting information was. I learned after awhile even with my son who is now 22, that if you dont ask for every single detail or dont expect them to come to you they do come and tell you interesting little things about there lives.      - Not being home.     Thats expected for every teenager to not be home! My 14 year old girls dont even drive and there social life is ALWAYS "Not home" The past 6 weekends they have had friends over,gone to a friends house,gone to a party,gone to visit there older brother...Just gone thats something you will have to look forward too they want to get away more and more the older they get but my 22 year old oldest son since he has been gone since he was 18 he is finally coming home more often and wanting to tell me everything thats going on.    Teen years are hard no matter what your baby wont stay your baby for long and i'm already seeing those signs in my 14 year olds too. You have to get use to it and enjoy the time you have right now because it will not stay like this forever.... But no matter what they will come back sooner or later!|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	If your daughter is good at getting away with things, then you'll be ok.  For example, about 10 years ago (I'm starting to feel old!) I started doing things that my parents probably would have frowned upon, but I still went to school, worked and got good grades.  So, I got away with the bad things, not that bad, but enough to get in trouble for.  That made me a happy gal and my parents never gave me a hard time.|`|r39EDGhPaa	I'm 16 and I NEVER went through that stage.  My mom and I haven't always gotten along well, but she used to be a little loopy.  But I was never one of those kids who stopped communicating with their parents, or was out all the time, etc.  If she is still good now, I don't think you have much to worry about.|`|8F3IHGADaa	She's already 15. If she were going to turn on you, she would've done it by now!|`|twyjXSVuaa	I'm thirteen and although I'm not as old as your daughter I've been going through puberty for God knows how long. I've always been mature for my age (apparently) and have always respected my mum and we've always got on. Last year I turned thirteen and I suddenly got very moody. I was angry at her over the slightest thing. I felt that everything was her fault. Four months after my birthday I started my periods and the moods got worse.    I'm better at controlling my temper now and get on better with my mum except the day before my period when everyone aggravates me and  I sometimes lose it and scream and yell and take my anger out on either my sisters or my pillow. I don't seriously hurt my sisters btw they fight back lol   But we get on better. I love my Mum to bits and would never actually say anything nasty to her. Even though I get mad at her I never tell her. I still respect her. I'e never told her I hate her, I've never gone through a silent stage, I don't break the rules a lot and I often do as she says.    Your daughter has come this far I don't think she'll rebel. She might. But hopefully it'll pass.   If she does, I'll be happy to give you advice :) I myself am a teenager after all :D|`|1ca70b7849e7eae97dddbd3fdbe9e22daa	it all depends on the friends she has if they are bad friends who tend to do drugs and drink to look cool they might force her to those thing so she can still be their friend but that all depends on her.|`|SU8z0TUoaa	I have a 20 year old daughter, and our relationship has always been good, although she has had problems with her mom (we were divorced for several years and our oldest lived with me.) I guess I was a fairly permissive parent, so it worked out okay.
00X4m7vjaa	I was told not t o wash them with soap when I am showering, Because it causes them to get dry, I actually had dry skin on mine|`|gx4s68s8aa	I tried tons of different lotions.  Then Aveeno Soothing Baby was recommended by a friend. It worked and finally I got relief.  It might work for you too. It has oatmeal in it and that seems to sooth the skin.|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	You might try shea butter or lanolin. If you use lanolin, get some nursing pads so it doesn't make your bra all gross... it stays on really well and will help later in pregnancy if you get tender nipples and after birth if you plan on breastfeeding.|`|fVpRVofLaa	Just lotions.Sorry.|`|AA10500537	ask your dr,|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	I believe lotion and maybe a warm shower would be about the only thing to help. Mine have been very dry too but the lotion seems to help a little. Good luck.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Try a hair oil...like Biosilk or the generic form (Biosilk can be a little pricey for what you're going to use it for).  It may do a little better than lotions.|`|EzbJsE5eaa	I used Palmer's Cocoa Butter. It works for me. I think anything with cocoa butter will help. I also use a Vasoline cocoa butter because it's more intensive, and it's considered an "extra care" cream and it has deep conditioning. I would try one of those.
fHjSonssaa	For the "green" veggies- go to frozen.  They are fresher and taste better.  I asked my son's DR why he wasn't eating green and she said the stuff on the shelves is just really bland to them.  Frozen tastes better- they make baby.      Also- 2nd foods are, for the most part jsut bigger protions.  I've learned this.  I was so so confused when I went shopping for food the first time- but now that we've tried them, the consistancy is not different- however there are lots MORE options andsome may have a different texture.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Buy some and look at it.  In my limited experience with Gerber, their stage one and stage two foods are basically the same consistency.|`|OHq5gSjJaa	I know gerber makes a stage 1 green beans that is all pureed with no pieces.|`|DNygQdmVaa	they have green beans in stage 1.|`|CmxJdPh2aa	water it down. they should have some green beans that are stage 1, maybe they don't carry it at the store you shopped at. try another store? but if not, i would just water it down a bit.      personally i would wait, but my doc didn't clear me for cereal feeding until about 6 months of age. he didn't start eating flavors until at least 7-8 months.|`|33h5R8nTaa	They make green beans for 1st also, my daughter actually loves green beans ans peas. She has since the first bite.|`|m9aggkGaaa	In my experience, I've found the consistency of the plain veggies and fruits is basically the same in all the stages.  The only difference is with the meals, those do get chunkier in the stage 3 jars.    It may be that some children don't react well to green beans so they made it a stage 2 (like they do with berries)?     I would say try it because you'll know soon after if he doesn't like them or can't digest them enough.
WlU3NFu6aa	It might work, it might not. I think it depends if your body is ready. But i was one cm dilated when i had my membrane stripped. It was at about 12 in the afternoon. My water broke 330 early the next morning. But just to let you know i did spend the day eating spicy food, walking around Walmart and i forced hubby to ahve sex with me that night. I decided to throw in every thing that could possibly induce labor. well something must hve worked! my daughter was born 1104pm that night.  Oh and I was 3 days from my due date.  good luck to you and congrats! im sure the next time we hear from you you will be asking questions about your newborn!|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I had a sweep at 39 weeks, two days before I was due to be induced.  I was 2cm at the sweep, I think it was quite successful because I had lots of show and cramping afterwards.  That night I had contractions for a few hours, I really though I was going into labour, but by the next morning they'd stopped, so I was induced as planned :(    The contractions after the sweep did get me to 3cm though, so maybe if I'd been able to have more time I would've gone into labour soon, unfortunately I didn't have the option, lol.|`|vcxdTXbraa	They say you can go into labour that night. I had a membrane sweep twice with my son and still went a week and a half overdue and ended up being induced.|`|mgLb5Yohaa	I had membranes swept 2 days before labor began, I was only 1 cm dilated. I was crampy and had diarhhea the day after my appointment, then went into full labor the next day! Once 2nd stage labor began, it took 8 hours to dilate to 10 cm (my first child), so...it's a crap shot...it may work, it may not. It really does depend if baby is ready to come!    Get to walking, sista!|`|cjd29FNnaa	Doctors make me cross; they should not even offer you a sweep until 40 weeks and 7 days; even then you should consider very carefully.  Very often a sweep can cause your waters to break, if your body isn't ready to start labour within 24 hours they will insist you have a cesarean.  We should all keep hold of our waters they are there for a reason.    If any one wants to perform any procedure please ask for the plus and down sides before agreeing.  Speak to AIMs (association for improvements in maternity services) they will tell you what they are allowed or not allowed to do.    We are women  and have birthed naturally since time began and should not be interfered with just because it suits the medical protocol.    Good luck.
yB5go5wbaa	All mothers with babies, no matter what language they speak, do this with their kids - it's an actual language called Motherese that helps the baby develop his or her own language and communication skills.  It's good for the baby!  Motherese in all different cultures is sing-songy and usually higher pitched and more basic than our "normal" language.  Babies use this as a model for communicating themselves when they develop their speech.|`|wKYdIaZVaa	I usually try not to speak to my daughter so much in baby talk, but I do catch myself doing it from time to time. The worse thing I do is sing these silly songs I make up for EVERYTHING!... I must drive her insane... too bad she can't tell me to shut up! :)|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	I used to do that too, but as long as you talk to them in grown up talk then your alright, its hard to resist!|`|zQQd2wPRaa	well i hope you love him. geez.    no, he is only 3 months!!|`|33h5R8nTaa	ok so my mom used to do this to me and sometimes she still goes around singing stupid songs to the dog...But i find now that i have a daughter i do it to.

My hubby7 and dad look at me like im stupid and tell me to talk normal but whatever it makes her laugh.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	If you feel comfortable with baby talk, then that's great.  It doesn't matter how you talk to your baby, just as long as you do talk to him.  It is a myth that using baby talk makes a baby talk funny when he grows up.|`|74pfB2Bnaa	I do that, too. The songs change as baby grows. It somehow happens automatically. It is considered helpful for baby's language development. My best friend who works as language therapist in a kindergarden employs baby talk on purpose to stimulate small children to babble. So trust your instincts and be silly.|`|9X09kM4oaa	It wont affect him- baby talk is perfectly fine. its fun though to see their faces when you fluctuate your voice, like go normal talking then baby talk and back and forth within the same sentence- try it its hilarious!|`|xif22nwoaa	The research actually shows that "baby talk" that involves real words is more beneficial to babies' language learning than is talking in a normal voice.  You shouldn't be making random "goo-goo, gaa-gaa" sounds, but raising the pitch of your voice attracts the baby's attention and using short simple phrases aids in their comprehension and they learn the meaning of words more quickly.    However, the key is to speak in grammatically correct ways and use real words.  Don't say things like "Her's so cute, yes her is" (the Sears photographer does that and it drives me NUTS).  Use correct speech and the child will learn that, and will be less likely to speak in "baby talk" ways.|`|GpR5MI5raa	i think silly voices are fun sometimes, but real talk helps children learn how to speak|`|PZLwu9QAaa	Children do not need baby talk to learn to speak, but it's not going to harm him.  He is just going to love the sound of your voice, no matter how silly an adult thinks it sounds.  If this is how you show him attention, do it!  You can't spoil a baby, no matter what anyone tells you.|`|2cstdEkIaa	Its fine anfd comes natural, but soon you may want to start saying things in a more clearer form so he can pick up the correct language. You dont have to stop with the silly voices though.|`|TzLe0GEEaa	Babies learn by mimicking those around them.  Talking in baby talk allows him to hear many different types of sounds.  Communicating with him at all will help him learn to talk.  It is much better to talk to him in baby talk than not at all.  He will hear "adult talk" so much that talking to him in baby talk will not hinder his development.  Sing as many silly songs as you like!|`|Vo38ccPOaa	I wouldn't say that baby talk is bad however talking to them in the language that they would later develop can be very helpful since they will learn from what is being taught to them specially from parents, I suggest that baby talk be left out. I have 2 yr. old nieces, twins and from birth baby talk wasn't aloud.|`|yPNvecc7aa	Right now I think it's fine. My sister in law was totally against baby talk as well (she's a teacher), but now that she's given birth, she can't help herself!   We don't use stupid words to replace real words (like bah-bah instead of bottle). We speak real English.   But somehow when you talk to the little guy, you can't help your voice going up a few octaves! LOL|`|NroZQN5vaa	It's okay to do sometimes and it's a lot of fun to make up silly songs to sing for your baby but using baby talk consistently can lead to problems. Your baby may grow up thinking that the word for bottle is "baawaa" or what ever, you know? We use it sometimes but for the most part, we stick to the language we use around adults.|`|7cbnFfIdaa	my daughter is 2 months and i do the same thing. i read that you should repeat what they say to you and have a "conversation" its good for them and i don't think it will have any bad effects on him at all. i read that's its good to communicate with them, and even though they wont actually say words for a while yet, tell him to say mama or dada anyways!|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	Silly songs are good for his language development.  Keep making them up and keep singing them.  As for the baby talk, using a high pitched voice is fine but "goo-goo gaga" isn't necessary.  Just talk to him using the same words you use with someone who talks back.  That is how he learns to talk with you.      I talk to my son a lot.  I tell him what I'm doing, ask him what he's doing, tell him where we're going, etc.  Babies learn to talk by hearing people talk.|`|WJjfrf0Caa	it's called motherese. it's really not bad the child. just mix it up a bit.    and when you are talking to your child, make sure that you include conversational pauses. so when you ask a question pause for 2 seconds to leave time where you child would answer. of course your baby won't answer, but you will be laying down the foundation for future pragmatic skills that will allow your baby to be successful in life.    check out the link for more motherese info|`|pXSKSS3daa	I've never really talked to Noah in "baby talk". Nothing against it and I doubt it will affect your son later on(because, lets face it, I doubt you'll continue this past the age of one!), but it's just not something I do.    I was guilty of asking him if he wanted his "baba" when he was on a bottle and I still ask him if he wants some "milky".|`|6HMgT5LCaa	No. The children actually understand more when you talk in their type of language. Babies are very smart for their age. There is nothing that's going to affect him in the future, it's all in everyone's head. I helped raise my ex-fiancee's child, and she turned out perfect.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Babytalk is natural.  ALL mothers in ALL cultures do it.  Babies seem to respond to the sort of high pitched 'sing-song' rhythm, and the simplified grammar and sentence structure makes it easier for them to learn to talk.    Of course there is 'baby-talk' and there's 'baby-talk.'  "Look at the doggie!"  is fine. "Oooohhh... widdle biddy babykins! Wook at the cutesy-wootsie puppie-doggie!" is quite another.

tlu9wlNAaa	why not get a board to go on the back for your son and just buy a sinlge it would be cheaper to. thry have a jogging stroller in zellers for $180 mongoose i think and its quite a nice one my friend has it and says she loves it so easy to push|`|4gZYucHMaa	Just think, you're going to be running (hard enough) plus pushing the weight of the stroller (30 lbs) and then the kids weight of 66lbs. You're going to pushing 90+ lbs!!    I did that with my daughter bc I was really big at running at the time (doing about 45 milers/wk) and it was tough and she was only a few months old at the time..when I restarted running after not doing it for 7 years last year, I thought I'd put my son in a jogging stroller and you know what he said...''mom I'm not a baby, I'm too big!!'' and he was at the height requirement and weight and he was only 3 at the time.    I now just go first thing in the morning before the kids are awake and when hubby is home to look after them--it means getting out at 5 am but I like my ''me time''    In other words, you're son is too big for the stroller.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	You'd have to check the weight limit on the stroller.  My BOB will still hold my kids and they are 3 and 4.   But my kids are not big fans of long runs, especially when we pass a park.  Im thinking of getting them headphones, or something else to keep them busy for the long ones.  As they dont nap in it anymore.     Id check out craigslist for deals on used ones.  Or websites like momjogger.com.    Now if only some of these runs allowed strollers, many group em with skateboards - grrrrr.    That board thing above doesnt sound safe.  A lot of the jogging ones have extra safety mechanisms, especially for hills.|`|f4zHMZ1iaa	Be a real athlete and carry them both in your arms while you run.
fbbd8990856c83abb2849c2b3d9ad5eeaa	I'm graduating from a university with a finance degree this semester and cannot find a job. There are little job openings, and the ones that there are require experience.     My family's icecream business is failing after doing pretty well and we cannot sell because no one will buy.    My family owns multiple houses in which we cannot sell because no one will buy for a fair price right now.    My father has taken extreme pay cuts with his insurance business.    My in-laws are on the brink of losing everything because they were mostly involved in the real estate business.    So yeah, it's affected me and my family pretty badly. I cannot wait to graduate and be broke and cannot afford to live anywhere...|`|FD8I4zthaa	Affected, yes.    Effected. Not yet.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	It's not affected us- yet- and hopefully it won't.   I'm planning to go back to work in the fall (self employed) but I'm going to have to probably take a pay cut for what I do because otherwise I will have no income or clients.|`|ykH93Wyxaa	i lost my job through it an im now struggling to find new work as no body is taking on in the building trade|`|a3MSSvdcaa	I'm feeling the pain of it lol (read the last question I posted!)

So im jobless at the min! Finding 1 is gonna be like finding rockin horse sh it!|`|qvl3PjdEaa	I know a few folks effected by it.    It all depends on mortgages, profession, credit history. Those who have a decent enough job to cover the mortgage and that ghastly gas bill will be just peachy.    It is massively bad though. My town centre was booming about 6 months ago. About 90% of the shops are closed and the rest that are open have sales of up to 75-90% off. That says alot. Also if you haven't noticed. 10's of well known stores are gone, including Woolworths. Marks and Spencer have shut a few stores due to it, and there are millions of job loses.    People on the doll have increased by nearly double and there is expected to be further job loses and people signing on.    This afternoon another 0.5% interest were cut. The only hope that gives for the time being (until maybe a few months) is those who have tracker mortgages will get to pay less monthly.    It is absolutely terrible. This recession is global. Do you remember Iceland and everyones savings being lost? Those who invested in overseas banks lost their own money!    Peace    FX|`|JvsFHyw4aa	Its effecting about half of everybody I know.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	It's effecting us horribly! :o( I'm 17 weeks pregnant (which is brilliant!) but my husband has been made redundant because of the recesiion and my job is only min wage which will be getting cut as soon as I start maternity leave.    We are now in debt up to our eyeballs because my wage simply does not cover all we need and I am becoming very ill as a result of all the stress our financial worries are causing and also due to the fact that we can't really afford to buy meat anymore so I'm not getting the nutrients I need during pregnancy.    Also terrifeid we are going to have to leave our home bacuse the payments on it are far too high...really worried about theworld my baby is going to be born into!     Nice to hear that somebody hasn't been so badly affected by it! :o)|`|EAxjVxTEaa	Its bad. I lost my job. I worked for circuit city. Its closed. Been trying to find another job and cant find one.

This is also going to have an effect on the local construction companies down the road. If the architects aren't drawing anything now, the builders wont have anything to build later....|`|mgLb5Yohaa	WOW...it's good to see people that haven't been affected for a change. Yes, it has affected me and my livelihood dearly. My husband works for Lexus, and the cutbacks have been enormous. They stopped contributing to 40lK 6 months ago, everyone has taken a 5-7% pay cut, no matter what position, and insurance premiums are going up...again! We've been blessed with our first baby boy, and already bringing him into this world caused our insurance to go from $550/mth, to $755/mth...and it's going up again! That doesn't include dental, vision, disability, etc. It's crazy how much comes off the gross...it equates to another month's worth salary!    Since I've come back to work from maternity leave, my company has undergone a drastic loss of clientele, that has snowballed into layoffs and my personal full time employment has led to part time.     We have truly been affected by this poisoning recession, as well as our family, friends, and community. We live in VA, USA. I'm amazed to hear anyone say the recession hasn't affected them...|`|aWWgPkryaa	I was made redundant a while ago, the sector I worked in has taken a beating and people are still being made redundant now.  Finding a job that will cover the nursery fees (which have just gone up) and my half of the mortgage is pretty crazy!    I am friends with people I used work with and they are under huge stress and pressure, no-one knows who could be next to be cut.    I had it all nicely planned out, baby, maternity leave and then back to work!  Ah well the best laid plans...

Louisa is both sweet and strong, and sounds in stride with naming trends. If I had to pick, Louise, just because Lucie is too cutesy for my taste as a given name. I would consider using Lucinda as a given name and calling her Luci, though.|`|BomQzrT1aa	Lucie, but spell it a little differently to make it stand out;    like Luci    or Lucee.

You wouldn't be asking here really if you didn't believe in your instinct.  You know her best.  I can only suggest speaking to her mum about this.  She may not thank you for it, but her mum will.

mgLb5Yohaa	Possibly...I also implantation bleeding. It is rare, but it does exist! It came when my period was supposed to, but it way much too light of a flow to be a period. If the flow doesn't increase, chances are it's implantation bleeding...and you'll get a BFP soon!
DRb4Qlypaa	It is good to exercise when you are pregnant as long as it was at the level that you were exercising before you got pregnant. Some exercises are obvious not to do, such as weight lifting and contact sports, or anything that would cause you to fall down. Other than that, when you go to the OB, just let her know what types of exercise you are involved in and she should give you more details.|`|b3CwObBdaa	i took prenatal workouts at my gym when i found out i was pregnant.  i was already going to the gym though, so was pretty active to begin with.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	My doc told me I could work out but to keep my heart rate under 140.

Whilst pregnant you need to work out. Lightly, swimming, walking, nothing as to where you are bouncing and no heavy lifting is important.   You must not get overheated, even early-on. Thats why no hot showers, baths, even saunas.   Thats the downer in pregnancy, you have to stop alot of things you love!   I's still go,  but I will be very aware of my movements and I def wouldn't be doing the full hog. I'd take it really steady and drink tons of water.     Good luck and god bless x

AA10196172	The home tests measure hGC (Pregnancy hormone). they are not as sensitive as a doctor's blood test, so yes, they do say "Negative", sometimes, for some women who are pregnant. Get a doctor's blood test, it's more sensitive and more accurate.    Does pre-c*m have sperm in it? Some say yes, some say no. There's only one way to find out, and you've been doing it. The more you did it, the more likely that something hit the jackpot.     The answer is, "it depends". If he's really excited, if he got close, if his prostate leaks a bit, if he had an orgasm before (what did you do before the main event? what did he do before the date?) and hasn't had a big pee to clean out his pipes - then yes. Plus, he may have let go a little bit and lied about it, so that you wouldn't cut him off. If he had an orgasm, then a repeat performance in the next few hours probably wasn't a good idea. Who knows? Safest thing is to not risk it, if you can't afford the diapers and daycare.    So you could be feeling the effects. The usual rule is that morning sickness shows up about the 6th week or so, so it's a little early if that's what it is.    Or, you could just have a stomach flu.     Yes, if you think you have a problem get the doctor's test; if nothing else, it should tell you if you are not.    From now on, use protection.|`|ajPHMliqaa	only if u swallow it|`|ZaadvJAXaa	Yes, it can.  You could possibly be pregnant.  Take a blood test.|`|DNygQdmVaa	yes thats true you can get pregnant from precum. though not likely.      i would test again.|`|YzCPY48qaa	im 9 weeks pregnant,we used the 'pull out and pray' method,only once!|`|2013075b963c70173a3dc732a3f43ecfaa	Absolutely... a friend of mine got pregnant using the "pull out" method. It is not a good form of birth control. I advise you to at least take a home pregnancy test. If your period does not show soon even after a negative home test... see your doctor. There might be another issue that needs to be addressed besides a pregnancy.... or the home test did not detect a possible pregnancy (a blood test will confirm for sure). Good luck to you!|`|5yAsj29Vaa	I am so sick of seeing this question.  If you do not know that precum has sperm and can get your pregnant than you're not old enough and/or smart enough to be having sex.|`|fVpRVofLaa	Yes, it sure can!|`|627pWyVkaa	yes precum can get you pregnant, Why wouldnt it? precum or full *** is the same thing, it both has sperm right? Which is how you get pregnant.       You should re-test, you may be sick Or you may be pregnant, Wait a week take another HPT or a blood test will tell you.|`|oNBKUpEzaa	Yes Precum CAN get you pregnant. If you think you are pregnant,consult a doctor. Go get tested,a lot of at home pregnancy tests are usually wrong. I hope i helped you out a little.

The pull-out method is the most unreliable method of birth control.    I agree with this answer!!.... "If you do not know that precum has sperm and can get your pregnant than you're not old enough and/or smart enough to be having sex."|`|i3pn4jNcaa	yes use a condom|`|LABC73E7aa	yes it can get you pregnant. take a blood test.|`|GjuRYsITaa	yes it is very true|`|1FSyB8twaa	Yes precum can get you pregnant. take another test and if it still comes back negative, go for a blood test :)|`|oo7p1Etyaa	Yes you can, a friend of mine did.|`|7p7EH334aa	you are jost likely pregnant, and yes precum is just as effective as the actual ejaculation.  i would recommend a htp (home pregnancy test) before seeing a doctor|`|82023d32c67aacffdd25314a33b1ea50aa	yes, yes, yes.....I have experienced it first hand!!|`|YFPMcHCbaa	Isn't this stuff taught in school anymore?       Precum has sperm in it, and it CAN get you pregnant. Do a little research before you come and ask questions. There are many websites full of information, and I'm sure this question has been answered before, if you just searched for it in Y!A.|`|dGBrlJvgaa	Yes it can, that is how I have my first child. It could be that you are just making yourself stress out about it and that is why your period is late. However, I would go to the doctor and get a blood test done, just to be sure.|`|otFCWMuUaa	yes it can and the woman on here who said it isnt likely is wrong.. there can be around 1 million sperm just within precum..    the test is coming up negative so u might not be but id take a blood test to be sure.|`|AA10626484	yes my first girl was a result of pre ***!!! Better get a test!
MxhNzW7Oaa	it could be any number of things. Autism, speech delay, hearing problems...you need to take him to a specialist and see what could be causing it. My son is 4 and talks no where near how he should. I'd say he talks like a 2 year old, if not younger. He was diagnosed with PDD (Autism) last Thursday.     Is your son doing anything else *unusual*? (Rocking/bouncing/hand-flapping, tantrums/frustration, stacking blocks...anything like that?) Those are signs of autism (as well as many others.) I didn't want to believe my son had it but I finally faced the truth and now we're on the road to getting him help.     But take him to a doctor and see what they say.    Good luck!    ETA: I'm not trying to push an autism diagnosis on you, but was he evaluated by a autism specialist? My son is also very affectionate & sometimes makes eye contact but meets the other *criteria* to be considered autistic. If he hasn't seen an autism specialist, i would take him just to be sure.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I have a son who is 8 who had a speech regression following a vaccine, it happened over a few weeks period that he stopped talking altogether.  He did get an autistic features diagnosis PDD.NOS.  Psychologists always say no its not an autistic spectrum disorder, neurologists are the ones saying it.      A speech regression isn't a normal finding.  There is no way of knowing what caused it but some variables are a virus, or vaccines.  AND this is in no way crap Dr. Greenspan has examined my son and so has Kennedy Krieger and both feel that the regression and autism development was the result of either vaccines or a virus.      So one option of a possibility is the above.    This son also has an auditory processing disorder, another possibility.    Another option:  My 3 year old repeatedly failed or has had inconclusive hearing tests.  They did do an ABR-auditory brain response test to check for auditory neuropathy.  Auditory neuropathy is another possibility.    My son passed  the ABR and was dx with Eucstacian tube dysfunction-this is another possibility.    The difficulty in making sounds could be dyspraxia.    So possibilities:  autistic spectrum disorder  auditory processing disorder  auditory neuropathy  eucstacian tube dysfunction  dyspraxia/apraxia    The auditory neuropathy is a weird one, its not a hearing problem, all the functions of the ear work perfectly well, its a problem either in transmitting to the brain, or the brain getting the message and sending it back.  It is kinda like a radio that fades in and out of tune.  I noticed with my son that if there were multiple things making noise he had difficulty telling where the noise came from for example say the tv is on and kids are making noise and this son is distressed, I call his name he hears it and walks past the door because he couldn't tell where it was coming from.    The eucstacian tube dsysfunction is weird too because the eucstacian tube is supposed to equalize the pressure between the middle and inner ear.  This changes throughout the day even.  This is like being underwater, or flying in a plane before your ears have popped and you feel tremendous pressure.  The pressure pulls the ear drum or tympanic membrane really tight making vibration minimal thus decreasing hearing from time to time.  At times my sons pressure would be fine at other times his eardrum wouldn't register much at all.    The auditory processing disorder would be someone who doesn't rely upon their hearing as accurate.  This person would have difficulty telling the difference between what sounds are important and unable to filter out the birds chirping, cars driving by etc.  I have this to an extent, when I take a test and am concentrating it is very apparent to me and distracting who is coughing, sneezing, shuffling there feet ect.    dyspraxia/apraxia would be more of a motor planning problem.  He can make the sounds but putting them together in order is the difficulty|`|KmC0K59taa	Has he been tested for autism?  I don't have any personal experience with it, but I have read plenty.  I have a cousin whose son is now 7 and he has had major speech issues.  He is not autisitc yet they aren't sure what is wrong with him.  He understands and acts normal in every other way.    I would keep seeing doctors and specialists until I found a diagnosis.  Good luck.|`|zX4nU1Rtaa	ok ill tell u this from experience my son is 21 months old and he is talking well decently...he will talk when he is ready some kids just arent very vocal..dont fall into this autism crap that people want to throw at u..some kids just dont talk until they are ready...give him some time and keep working with him on words and never give up    edit: autism crap was not to offend anyone|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	My parents struggled for a very long time to figure out why my younger brother wasn't talking at 3.  He under went every test in the book.  The were considering diagnosing him with autism (probably just because they couldn't figure out anything else that was wrong).  Finally after months and months of searching for answers, he was diagnosed with Auditory Processing Disorder.  It's can be easily mistake for autism.  He worked with a speech therapist who used lots of visual cues to teach him how form words.  I was only about 10 when this was all happening so I'm not really sure about any more details, but it might be something to look into if he hasn't yet been tested for it.  Now my brother is a bright normal 17 year old.  You would never know he any kind of disorder....    FYI--Auditory Processing Disorder is not a hearing problem.  It has to do with the transmitions from the ears to the brain getting jumbled.  In my brothers case sounds in words were reversed between the ear and the brain.|`|JYcF0Jl5aa	I have a similar experience w/ my son. My son received Speech Therapy for 2 months without any success. I finally called Early Intervention (a government agency which works w/children under 3 in most states) The agency came to my house with a group of therapists (ocuppational, speech, developmental, physical, & psycologist) & did some test on him. They told me my son may has autism, which was confirmed later on by a group of developmental Drs... Now, your son is 34 months old, he has just 2 month least to use Early Intervention. I suggest you to call the agency to get at least a prognoses & make a transition to the school district in which will provide the services that your son may need... I'm not telling you your son has autism, not. It may be verbal appraxial, or a level case of autism like PDD-NOS. There are some many things that may cause language delay that it would be better to get a real diagnosis. But, if your son receives the right services early, he would be ok by the time he starts elementary school..|`|dR4QN0gHaa	My son is 27 months old and his speech is not where it should be. I took him to his pediatrician and he recommended that we schedule a hearing test for him. He said the most common cause of delayed speech is because the child isn't hearing 100%. He scheduled us with a ear, nose and throat doctor and an audiologist. His appointment with the audiologist is feb. 10 so we are patiently waiting for his results. If he hasn't had a hearing test before you might want to ask your pediatrician.|`|5CwWM1t4aa	Loss of skills such as no longer saying words he once said seems to suggest autism, but I'm pretty sure that's not the issue.  You mention how social & affectionate he is. (A developmental pediatrician can rule this out for you, if you have doubts)    You seem like a bright family, and your son's intelligence gives him ways to communicate non-verbally so he's fine at home, but it sounds to me like your speech therapist isn't helping as much as she could.  A bright child should be making progress with therapy - and the therapist should probably know what's wrong and how to treat him.  Or, she should be giving you these recommendations!    Are you getting services for him through Early Intervention?  You should have reports both from the evaluation and from the therapy, if he's had it for a year (or if they issue reports more frequently).  Please take those reports to someone else!  I would suggest asking your health insurance about private therapy.  See what experts (neurologist, speech/language pathologist, etc.) are covered and get at least one new assessment for your son.      There could be a simple explanation such as a shortened frenulum (also called a lingual frenum) and he needs the underside of his tongue clipped in order to be able to articulate.  Or, there could be an underlying issue - they're so much harder to spot if a child is able to adapt ("excellent problem solving abilties" as you put it!).  A neurologist will know what to look for, even when a pediatrician doesn't.    I'm sorry you're dealing with this - brace yourself because you may have to face some resistance before you get your answers.  But, that's the only REAL way your son can get the help he needs.  Good for you for pursuing it even further!    Good Luck!  Allyson    Edit: p.s. - It's hard, but try to get him to use (any) speech and don't follow his non-verbal demands.  Also, make sure his very verbal sister isn't doing his talking for him :)

Firstly I'd like to say that your family names are great and quite traditional I love traditional names the best but modern names are cool too. Maybe as you have two children with names starting with the letter N maybe go for a name which starts with the letter E.   Names that I think would go with your children names:-  Boys..   Elijah Jacob I think this name is a great biblical name, Elijah meaning god is my word goes so well with your husbands middle name Jacob. Eli would be a great nickname.   Evan Alexander I think this name is good too and is one of my favourite combo's again it is a traditional with a the first name having a holy meaning which is god is good.   Girls...   Eloisa Pearl this name is really classy and cute, Eloisa meaning sun goes really really with Pearl which is a great stone and a good classic name.   Elise Lillian this name is really unique yet i feel classy and flows together really well, Lillian is also one of my favourite names.   Hope this helps and good luck.|`|1e7f68ee6a0d79eda6c821e9a33f6438aa	Girl  Elizabeth Madison    Boy  Ethan Miles    also like  Quinn Mason  Alexandra Aura|`|72SrLDQ3aa	I love all the names    Jacob Andrew  Tristan Michael  Evan Marcus    Kylie Paige  Lauren Samantha  Madison Claire|`|NZKiSfVOaa	GIRLS - Zoe Rose ( I thought it would be nice for to have the same name as you)   - Zoe Mae    - Robyn Grace   - Ruby Grace   - Mia Grace   - Olivia Emily   - Lily Olivia   - Hannah  Grace   - Amelia Grace   - Abigail Mae     BOYS - Jacob Dylan   - James Jacob   - Samuel Jacob   - Ethan Jacob   - Joshua Jacob   - George Jacob   - Jack Dylan   - Dylan James   - Alfie Dylan   - Dylan Jacob   - Ethan Jack   - Ethan James     good luck xxx|`|uS07WAwcaa	Natalia Grace (good one)  Rachel Mirielle  Tyler Garret  Ryder Benjamin|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Ethan or Emma|`|LoP2CRE2aa	Well let me just tell you that I LOVE the name Elle!!

I can't understand what is saying for the life of me, but it sounds like "Short, short, short my sheets, spin me round and round, my legs can bend this way again," and the last line is unintelligible.    Oh darn, now it's in my head again, lol.  And of course, it's both my kids favorite toy.  *sigh*    I was thinking, and what's even worse with this dang thig is when the batteries start to run down.  then you get this warbly voice singing "short, short, short my sheets."

I thought I was the only one! I constantly have songs from this little spanish-speaking frog toy my daughter has... Its quite funny.     Also, my daughter's mobile plays mozart, beethoven and bach songs. I find myself often humming them... its quite sad... LOL|`|hGqQIusSaa	I sporadically whistle songs from her toys all day long. The people at work have even caught onto some of the tunes..|`|qFmOuXMXaa	Me not so much as of yet....but I make silly little songs (about whatever comes to mind) and I sing them to my 5 month old and I get though stuck in my head all the time. And half the time I catch my husband singing them after he hears me singing them a hundred times.lol    What we do for our little ones.
F6lZHRkVaa	Explain to her, with a smile on your face, exactly what happened.  Explain how nervous and dismayed you felt. Apologize profusely and promise it won't happen again. If she still punishes you, take your punishment like a man and do everything you can to get back in her good graces.    Good luck!|`|AkFag8tNaa	All you can do is to be honest with her and hopefully, you don't have a previous history w/that kind of thing.

Your Mom is pretty much going to be pissed no matter what you say, but it is not that big of a deal.
aSjdL4heaa	Young babies can not be spoiled by holding them too much, and can be emotionally and physically damaged (improper development of portions of the brain) if you try to let them cry it out.     Holding her is an important bonding experience.  You'll just have to deal with it for a while - in a couple of months she'll want more independence.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I hold my baby whenever she wants to be held. How old is your baby? Couldn't you get a sling to make things easier? Also, how about including your 3yo more with helping with the baby so s/he doesn't feel as left out :)|`|pXSKSS3daa	I hold him whenever he wants it.    Your three year old is old enough to understand the baby needs more attention now. Incorporate your three year old in the care of your baby, whenever possible. I'm not sure how old your baby is but have you tried a sling to carry her around?|`|X6as2nOAaa	I held my baby all the time because she liked it and now she is 6 months old and hardly wants to be held she wants down and try to move around.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	I have a 4 month old son who feels it's his job to be held constantly.  I also have a needy 2 year old.  I found that it works well for me to put him in the carrier.  That away he's being held, and I can attend to my daughter as well.|`|ZusC87WBaa	Have you thought about trying one of those carriers that you wear with baby in it?  They can be a lifesaver.  My little guy likes to be held a lot (he's only 4 weeks old though) and I spend a good deal of my day cuddling with him.  If she's not overly fond of her walker, look for something else she can play with.  I never used a walker myself, but if I didn't have a baby swing, I think I would go crazy!  Either way, it won't be that long before she's busy doing other things and wants to be held very little.  Just try to enjoy it.|`|wKYdIaZVaa	I held my daughter as much as she wanted. She's now 5 months old and never became "spoiled".     I don't know how old your baby is but what you can maybe do while you're taking care of your 3 year old is put her in her stroller and give her a toy to play with. This usually entertains my daughter while I get some stuff done around the house.. .|`|ostF23Omaa	well I don't know I would say to let her cry a little. Maybe ask your doc.  good luck.|`|DNygQdmVaa	I hold my baby whenever he wants me to, hes 14 months now and would rather play.  But when he was younger he would always want to be held.  maybe if you try some diff toys to diatract her?|`|hW6KrRQQaa	My baby is 5 months old and I hold her whenever she wants to be held.  If she is happy playing on the floor with her toys then I let her be.  If she starts to fuss I change her if needed, feed her if needed, or just hold her if she wants to be held.  I don't let her cry it out.|`|pZg05uygaa	Get a sling...you can carry her in with your hands free to play with your toddler. I have a Moby wrap. Its cheaper than most other slings and my baby loves it. It helps her go to sleep and lets me hold her while shopping, eating, doing housework, etc  I've also heard great things about Ergo carriers|`|1dueLOdvaa	I have a 4 yr old and a 6 month old. So I feel your pain.    Sometimes I have to just let my baby cry. I never let him scream or cry for very long. Like for example this afternoon, I was making my older son lunch and the baby started whining. I checked on the baby (who was in his exersaucer) and he was fine, probably just bored. So I let him fuss until I was done making my older son lunch. My baby wasn't screaming or even crying, he was whining. He had already been fed and changed.     Sometimes its what you have to do.    And I understand that its easy for mother with only 1 kid to say "I hold my baby whenever they want." Well I usually do too, but there are times when I just cant. I only have TWO hands and can only do so much at one time.|`|CmxJdPh2aa	get a baby carrier/sling. that is the best thing ever...you can't do EVERYTHING, but i can get away with doing light dishes and some vacuuming. i can also get away with reading and coloring with my three year old...or dancing around the room easier and involving my older child.     i'm in the same boat as you, minus the asthma. (i'm sorry for you for that one, poor little thing)      so what i do is try to keep my youngest occupied while i do things i can't do with her...and since she is needy that gives me little windows of "just enough" time.  i have a boppy so i can do more while i'm feeding her and also have a carrier. but sometimes i just dance around holding her and talk to my son...and ignore my other responsiblities. hah and that is okay--give yourself a break and only pay attention to the kiddies. its the best, and sometimes the ONLY, "days off" i get. lol

1e7f68ee6a0d79eda6c821e9a33f6438aa	Your name is very pretty and was chosen for you with love by your mother. I would not change it at all.

I was going to be called Alice but my dad didnt like it but my mum did, but they both agreed on beth and they dont have middle names so they didnt give me one but gave my sister one! and i love the name alice.

The first thing people see on paper is your name. Whether it be an application or a resume. Employers can make judgments ( I am by no means saying they all do) based on a persons name. But playing the devils advocate, a unique name will certainly be more memorable then an everyday normal name. If you are truly unhappy with your name when you get older and have thought it through, then by all means you should change your name.

I'm also taking evening primrose, wild yam root, and of course prenatal vitamins and folic acid. Can't tell if the evening primrose and wild yam root will work for me yet because we still haven't TTC, however it is necessary for every woman who could become pregnant to take prenatal vitamins and folic acid supplements. The added bonus is that theoretically, folic acid boosts ovulation.|`|GcJszsMnaa	I'm trying..some thing from Iherb.com.....It's fertility blend for woman...also for me as well...it's only...23.50..or something like that..I've been on it for about 14 days now..an I've noticed..my breast seem more fuller..Lol an I defiantly like that...Lol...I read lots of good things about it...it has work well for others just after a month...Soo.. I'm excited!
AA11327039	If you can find a copy of Dr. Harvey Karp's Happiest Baby on the Block book and DVD (the DVD is much better than the book) read/watch and do as much as you can do.    It basically gives you a rundown of how to perfectly execute the 5 S's    1. Swaddling (really tight)  2. Side laying  3. Sucking  4. Swaying  5. Shhhhing|`|X6as2nOAaa	My baby is 6 months  old and is all the sudden waking up every 2 hours and I don't know why I asked this question just earlier.|`|0CGhpljyaa	throw in the dumpster down the street.  sike, some warm formula... and some soft Mozart, or calming music.|`|hTQg5tgPaa	If you are breastfeeding, then I had the same problem (between 10 - 2 am), this is very common especially if they are being breastfed.  When I told the nurse, she told me that I had a text book child.  She explained that my daughter was wanting to cluster feed.  1) to get the fatty milk to fill her up more 2) to build up your supply.  I don't know the answer if the baby is bottle fed. Once I learned this, it made life for me and my daughter more easier and I started trying to feed her lots in the evening instead, and her fussy time was between 6 to 10 instead - and fussy time wasn't all that fussy anymore, just wanted to feed & feed.    For the answer above, I had the same problem with mine at 6 months also (just happened that she was braking through all her teeth at the same time - 8 in seven weeks).  Once the teeth came through then she went back to getting up once during the night 4.5 hour sleep, eat, 4.5 hour sleep again.
WbJPQM1naa	Ultimately, YOUR intuition and understanding of your pregnancy is the MOST important opinion here!      Your doctor is judging, based upon what he's been taught is "normal" in pregnancy when it comes to size of your fundus and some ultrasound results.  But these "guesses" about the size of your baby can be wrong!  Just ask moms how many of them were told by their doctors that they would have a certain size baby, based upon their measurements or ultrasound and the outcome was VERY different!  I mean, I even saw an episode of "A Baby Story" where they were told, after ultrasound, that they were having a boy and it turned out to be girl!  So, all these things are really just technology trying to make up for the unknowns of pregnancy.    YOUR intuition and feeling about when your baby will be born and how big they will be is the only one that matters FOR YOU!  And you are allowed to be the ONLY authority in your pregnancy!  I mean, geez... women did this for thousands of years without ultrasounds and such and somehow knew, that they knew, certain things that NO doctor can even guess at!    I wouldn't worry about it, AT ALL.  Bottom line is your baby will be born when IT is ready to come and you will probably have a perfect, healthy baby!    Good luck and Many Blessings,  R|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	I would think maybe an ultra sound would be more accurate, because it can see the shape and size of the baby..|`|eya1WDS4aa	You always go by the dr.s due date not the ultra sounds. The dr. wont change your due date unless its over 2 weeks. My due date is june 12th but my ultrasound said june 7th. It normal to over measure.
prqrQcd1aa	measuring big simply means the height of your fundus (top of uterus) is measuring higher than it should be.. when you are 28 weeks along it usually measures 28.. so on and so forth. I would go by the ultra sound date for a couple reasons..one being they are more accurate in dating because they measure the size of the baby compared to others that far along, and the other being that just because you know the date of your last period doesn't mean that you ovulated on the 14th day, some people ovulate on the 7th day, some on the 18th day and so on.   I'm thinking that this child is going to be around 7lbs, 10 oz. It could be bigger though. I say it is probally goign to be smaller because my mom was measuring big with my last brother and sister, and it was simply because her uterus was already a little bigger than normal size because she had already had a few children..|`|PlmT4lHXaa	Well, i am not expert on this stuff by any means, but i would think that if your measuring big that just means your baby is growing fast. who knows, maybe he will be ready to come out before the full term!!!    And with my mom's expierence, her third baby (my little sister) was the biggest at 8 lb 4 ounces soooo maybe urs will be the biggest too!     Good luck!!!|`|505c28ffab4b949ab353bc9f3870e311aa	I would go with the ultrasound due date  April 14th.  That's more accurate.  And I'll guess the baby's gonna weigh 8lbs 2oz.       Good luck with your new little baby!!|`|dGBrlJvgaa	1) My doctor moved my date back because he thought that my son was small for that date we had. He was born a month early from the doctor's date and 1 1/2 weeks early from my date. I would stick with your original date, but make sure you have everything ready just in case.   2) My guess is 8lbs :)  Good luck!|`|upk9TNWsaa	Measuring big is talking about your stomach(the baby), I think...my dr. measured my stomach and said I was measuring small so...Ultra sound date would be more accurate, they changed mine after they looked at ultrasound. Ask your dr. to be sure. I'd say your going to have about a 8-9 lb baby. Im no expert though just a guess. Don't be afraid to talk to your dr. or midwife about these questions. I know sometimes you don't have these things on your mind at the time. Congrats and good luck with all your babies.
yrDqtazLaa	You can know if your HGC levels start to drop instead of rise, as determined by a doctor, of course. Also, the most common signs of miscarriage is very strong cramping and bright red blood.|`|g5RS83paaa	I was pregnant but not sick like the other pregnancies, then I started cramping and spotting when I was about 6 weeks pregnant, then it was a small clump of blood, like a clot, that came out in the toilet. The hospital confirmed it.|`|3XFZHhWgaa	You find out after you missed your period by a week or two...thats a chemical pregnancy and your period comes, but heavier and clottier. If its that early of a miscarriage, no you cannot see the baby, its got no form at that point because its too early. But if your having an early miscarriage, you would be having your period, but like I said, heavier and more blood clots then usual...also I heard its more painful.|`|IllWKAUGaa	It can happen at any time during pregnancy and there are no warning signs....you bleed heavy and have reallllly bad cramps. it often starts out as brown or pink/red spotting. depending on how far along you are you may see the baby when it passes, if it's early you probably wont. theres no way to predict one, just take care of yourself and body.|`|AA10153923	It should happen the day or near the day you miscarried.        * Vaginal bleeding that may be preceded by a brownish discharge      * Cramps in the pelvic area      * Tissue or blood clots passing from the vagina      * A decrease in the usual signs of early pregnancy, such as nausea and breast tenderness      * Pain in the lower back or abdomen|`|cBzyOACFaa	Everybody is different and experience different miscarriages but usually you will fell cramp like a period pain maybe a bit stronger and you will bleed quite heavy. however these can also happen in a healthy pregnancy so the best thing to do is get your GP to refer you to hospital for a scan where you will know for sure. And no a baby will not come out. more like blood clots.
VS8mactUaa	I doubt you were drugged :) But even so, they wont take your baby from you because you ate cake, and as for the effects, I doubt it will do anything at all, its sad o say but some pregnant woman smoke weed before and during their pregnancy, and their babies can be fine, your one time, possibly drugged cake is nothing to worry about, your baby will be fine and wont be taken from you. So smile and enjoy your pregnancy :) Baby dust to you!|`|b3CwObBdaa	i dunno.  up where i am they don't test for drugs.  i can't understand why they would take your baby for 'maybe' eating ganja cake.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	I doubt there was pot in the cake.  I have a friend who goes there every year and has never had an experience of pot being sneaked into her food.  If there was, as long as you don't habitually smoke or eat or inject it, it is no longer in yours or your baby's system.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	They let you on a plane at 6 months? I'm sure you and your baby are both fine. May have been sick from the flight? jet lag? or not to mention general sickness is known to come back somewhere around the 3rd trimester... could be nothing... if you don't feel better as always, consult your dr.|`|o8xNTVWTaa	u were prob just full and felt sleepy cuz u ate so much and u were like really early in ur pregnancy so being sleepy isn't uncommon|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Well even "if" there was something in the cake (which I doubt) it'd be out of your system by now.  I'm sure you've had a couple of dr appts since then and they'd probably notice if something drastically changed with your baby.  I think you're being a typical mommy...worry is normal.  I'm 16 weeks preggers and ANYTHING I eat makes me feel starge and sleepy :-)  If I sit in the same place for 5 minutes I get sleepy.  I'd let that one worry go...you'll have plenty more I'm sure.|`|e8HCEZDpaa	Quit worrying so much. They won't take your baby. Your baby should be just fine as well. If you ate the cake in November if there was anything in it, it would no longer be in your system.|`|oXFVRYCsaa	Don't worry i'm sure you'll be fine there may have been nothing in the cake i think you are worrying to much, if your midwife is checking you regularly and you've had scans i'm sure your baby is fine, i would explain whats happened to your midwife and get her to check everything out for you|`|fHgbL046aa	You will be fine. As long as you don't continue to ingesting marijuana. You must her about women who take far more drugs and there baby is fine. I'm not sure if it will be in your system when they test you.|`|7IHMjy2caa	If it was in November and it did have sonething in it (which I would think would be unlikely) then it would already be out of your system. As long as you are not a habitual users, marijuana leaves your system in 30 days. The more you use the longer it takes to leave your system.     I highly doubt they would take your child. 1. There would be nothing in your system, or the babies. 2. A one time thing is unlikely to leave lasting effects on your baby. 3. As a former CPS worker, I offered mother's who tested positive for marijuana services, I didn't take the babies unless stronger drugs were involved.     If you do use stronger substances often, then yes they may take your child.|`|n8UBfhgpaa	lol, im sorry, but I deal with anxiety as well. If your anything like me, you probably thought there was going to be something in the cake before you ate it. Its all in your head that you felt funny. Thats part of dealing with anxiety. Dont worry about it, you will be fine and I am sure the baby will too.|`|xnhwmontaa	ur fine...inject weed? the top contributor is crazy!! my friend SMOKED WEED  up until her 7 or 8th month they didn't take her baby...tho i don't suggest it! lol|`|2TMbpYWnaa	I struggle with very severe anxiety.  So i understand how you are making all these assumptions and connections.  But it is very unlikely you had a drug cake.  Also marijuana leaves your system relatively fast especially if you don't smoke it often. Someone who smokes pot daily can clear their system within 15 days to a month of not smokeing, and the less you smoke the quicker it is out of your system. So no marijuana would show up in your system or your babies if they were to test you.    If what you are concerned about is pot doing anything to harm the baby it is a natural plant and all though you probably shouldnt smoke it while your pregnant i dont think it would do much harm.      The worst thing to do right now while your pregnant is to stress yourself out, i know how hard it is not to do that for people like us but really you will be okay.  Maybe tell your doctor about it, he WILL not try to report you ta any social services if you tell him this story. It will just make you feel better to hear from a doctor that your fine, which you probably are.|`|F0kjf1j8aa	you can relax especially since you only ate the cake once, if it did have marijuana in it,it is already out of your system and not in baby's blood either. Don't think I am crazy but I have 4 children and during my last pregnancy morning sickness got so bad to the point where I was dehydrated and in the hospital and the pills they kept giving me so many different ones for nausea didn't help, So I would smoke marijuana and I was back to normal, before this I could not even keep anything down not even water and I think that's much worse then smoking don't get me wrong, don't smoke cigarettes that is bad, but my baby is 2 now and she came out with no problems at all and was a 9 pound butterball and she is so smart and i think it because of that and that's a good thing|`|D0cOnm59aa	ummmm, wow. Well did you go to the doctor right after you ate the cake and started feeling bad? Cuz if you didn't then that would be pretty stupid, if you were to go to the doctor and tell them about your situation then they would have no reason to take your baby away..|`|GjuRYsITaa	they wont take your baby luvy don't panic i dought it will have done any damage people do a lot worse while pregnant and there babies come out ok|`|5nAWhEKRaa	If you haven't you should have went to the doctor as soon as you got back and told hem or her what happened. So you need to go to your doctor and have hem test you and tell hem what happened asap. If you don't say noting and it dose come up positive than that's your fault for not trying to do any thing about in the first place.|`|5GPDrBPLaa	Please don't worry...it's not healthy for you or your pregnancy!  They will not take the baby.  Feeling strange and sleepy are definitely things that happen when you're pregnant...could it have been the fact that you were on a trip, recent flight, different food, pregnant?...most likely.      Even IF there was pot in the bread, it probably didn't do any harm.  So many chics do harmful things throughout their ENTIRE pregnancy.  A one-time thing is different from everyday use.    As for testing the baby, they will not do this, unless they think you have a drug problem.  As long as you drink TONS of water, as I'm sure you do because you're pg, it will help to flush out any remaining toxins that you might have ingested.    Good luck!|`|VArUXbeoaa	I highly doubt that there was anything in your cake...Like you said you were in Jamaica and they have herbs there...In Jamaica they use a lot of natural substances to cook, heal, and/or drink...you may have eaten a natural substance that you aren't use to...you are not in any danger...Jamaicans wouldn't feed you something that they wouldn't eat..Oh and your baby will be fine...if the lady could tell that you were pregnant then the substance is perfectly fine and it was in it to make your baby more healthy and help the baby...The baby will stay with you because there is nothing they can do...If it was an herb then it isn't in your system anymore
9X09kM4oaa	It took 3 weeks for my little girls iv bruise to go away on her leg- she was put in the hospital for 1 week when she was 1 week old for jaundice and vomiting. Do not pay attention to the rude answers!|`|AA11210211	It's normal,they took blood from my daughters hand when she was born and her hand was bruised for about a month,there is even a little scar there from the needle and she is 1 yr.|`|Grmsgziaaa	I dont know about babies, but after my c section my IV bruises showed up like a day later and lasted about a week and a half. Dont worry about it! If it starts to "spread", call your doctor.      ETA: This Andie R is a troll you guys, she gives really rude answers. Time to report her.|`|NLxCpn8iaa	I think this is pretty normal.  My son has been hospitalized many times with IVs and the bruising sometimes last several weeks.  If it looks worse, or his hand begins to change color or swell, or if he developes a fever, please take him in!|`|C0GeEv7kaa	Oh yes. My daughter was born 1/24/09 and she had blood drawn from her hand and the big bruise is still there.|`|wKYdIaZVaa	My daughter was in the NICU for about 11 days after birth and she had many needle marks :( They little bruises did stay for a about three weeks) No need to worry! If they continue and you're uneasy about it, just call up your doctor!|`|t9S0dqfLaa	Absolutely, It's icky and it looks bad but it's just a bruise.  Right ladies?
aba81bf0dd1e368904161a0c15faf44caa	Probably not.  As long as your baby doesn't seem congested or choking or anything you should be fine.    When I first brought my son home, I would be breastfeeding him, and when he would get sleepy the milk would just drip out of the nostril that was on the bottom.    Never seemed to bother him though :-)|`|X6as2nOAaa	I don't think so unless it seems to bother him.|`|zQQd2wPRaa	NO.Stop being a nut|`|CmxJdPh2aa	too cute. i worried when my daughter did this a couple times that it might hurt her. but she didn't seem bothered and all i could do what giggle. it was too cute. i'm sure its fine...ear, nose, throat are all connected basically so its bound to happen from time to time. if you are concerned call your doctor/advice nurse for reassurance.|`|NAzAmFDnaa	My son threw up once as a newborn and milk came up out his nose too.  I think it is just because all the muscles and passges are immature and the milk can travel up farther.  Unless you see bloody milk, I wouldn't worry.|`|lO2Nvj81aa	The exact same thing happens to my baby girl.  She caught a cold when she was ten days old and she started sneezing a lot...  Any time I fed her she would sneeze and formula would come out her nose.  I was freaking out!  Now that she's over her cold it doesn't happen as much, but I talked to her doctor about it and he said it's okay and not to worry about it.|`|rUPjr7hjaa	No need for concern :)
5805bf3a9bb2e4808ef2d73593aaab11aa	You could be too early in pregnancy for a test to register. It sounds like you might be. If you don't start in the next couple of days take the test again (once you've given your Hg levels a chance to rise.) If It turns out you're not pregnant I recommend looking into the Billings Ovulation Method. This is how my husband and I got pregnant. It won't matter if you have a regular cycle, you just pay attention to the natural signs of your body. I'm not a hippie or anything, I promise, this really does work. www.woomb.org    Good Luck to you! :)|`|x7WphuY5aa	it sounds like you might be pregnant********* baby dust********** but if not then you should be close to starting your period i would just wait to see don't take a hpt yet|`|rYGApJgdaa	IGNORE THE RUDE PERSON who made the awful comment...not funny jerk!! Anyhoooooo~ This could be a great sign....or it could be that your period is coming. Hang in for the next of couple of days and maybe you get to take a test!!! :-) Good Luck-sending you baby dust|`|tfTQ6Cuuaa	hard to tell since u are irregular but it sounds like it could be that u are pregnant! i would test this weekend because im addicted to peeing in a cup (i use the strips, cheaper) and if its - and no sign of af try to wait a couple more weeks unless u can get into your docs for a blood test    good luck, hope this is your month!!!!!! xx
A0Ss34ahaa	Hell yeah I remeber you. You were one of my favorite members LOL. Ha I'm so happy for you. Im very proud that you have finally put ur life back in track and u r happily married. Haha ur daughter an my son can have a play date LOL jk    Well I think teen pregnacy is a sad thing because we see many girls raising babies when they r kids themselves. But in the other hand it is really up to u to decide if u want to be categorized as a irresponsible teen mom or be remember for fighting against all odd for ur childs well being. I really think that at the end it all comes and it is based on the decisions you make during this period.     I do understand that condoms break and BC isn't 100% effective, it happens to me and it could happen to anyone,  and I'm proud of all teenagers that pick up the pices and takes responsibilities for their actions. In the other hand, it really makes me pissed when girls just go out and get pregnant for the heck of it and makes all of us who work our asses off look bad.|`|E7ViD8EWaa	I do! I do!  I remember you!  Not that I forgot about you =]    I...don't really have an opinion on teen pregnancy.  Every time I DO have an opinion, it gets so many thumbs down(and I get so many messages saying why I'm wrong), that I usually just delete the answers I've written it on.    I don't think they're bad people for having kids, and I totally respect the ones who take responsibility and raise them. I wouldn't be able to do that!   (Oh no! That was an opinion! >.    Any who, I'm glad you're back, and happy 'Been-in-the-world-for-a-month!' to Hailee (Three days belated...but still!)    =]|`|r39EDGhPaa	You're a teen mother, correct?  So, if someone says something that might be slightly offensive to you, are you going to freak like the other teen moms on here do?    Anyway,  I have nothing against teen pregnancy itself.  I just hate when there is confusion about who the babies father is, when the girl is being supported by her parents, when they are not even of legal working age, and of course, when no protection was used(i hate morons.) I think, by deciding to keep a baby, you are saying you will grow up and raise that baby on your own.  Some teen parents do a very good job, and some rely on their parents.  If you can do it, then more power to ya.. but it just irks me when people expect their parents to help.    edit: to the girl above me, that is a really sorry excuse for an analogy.  you can't help what color you are born, but you can keep from getting pregnant.|`|GGH0HVdvaa	Yes of course I remember barbie, she was the only doll at the time that girls played with when I was younger. Those stupid "Bratz" dolls weren't around yet.      My opinion on teenage pregnancy is that it sucks for all involved.|`|o0Q7LmMsaa	i myself don't really have an opinion on it.  to me it's just pregnancy, it's a normal part of life and yes they are young and it would have been better if they did wait until they were older, it may be a lil harder to go to school or work  but having a child is such a beautiful thing.  i don't think people should point their finger at people who have children during there teen years or while they are young.  i try not to judge because i don't know the whole story and why  and plus it's never a good thing to judge.  i have like 2 friends that are teen mothers and i think they are doing a great job. they all have it together and are living their lives.  my friend actually married her boyfriend and now there are  a happy family with their daughter, so i thought that was such a cute story.  but yeah that's just what i think about it|`|EccBqsntaa	YAY! You're back!   I'm pretty neutral on the topic. I can see why some people look down on teenage mothers. Like my mom's friend. She has 3 kids. Her oldest has 2 kids. The one in the middle has 2 also. And the youngest is only a freshman. The first two are girls. I've known them for awhile. The oldest, her son will be 6 this November. He spends most of his time with his grandma because his mom neglects him. He loves to fight because his mom hits him. I think she was 16 when he was born. Some people just can't handle the responsibility. My uncle's girlfriend or whatever has 2 daughters. Her youngest had a baby at 17 I think. She has 2 kids now. One was born in April of '08. The other was born in '06 in January. She just turned 3. I've never seen her without her mom. Well once, her mom went to Walmart with my mom and her grandma. But her grandpa was with her. She's around 21 or 20 now. She's just as good as a mom as my god mom who is turning 36 this April.    Some people can't handle it, others can handle it was well as any adult. I guess it depends on the person. Congratulations..I'm a gazillion years late saying it though!|`|R47Bj9Q6aa	yes of course i remember you! do you remember me lol?  i havent been on in months but just came back yesterday  Congrats on your baby girl !     I think teen pregnancy is unfortunate but it does happen and I admire the moms and dads that step up and either find a loving home for their baby or keep the baby.Having a baby is hard for everyone and it must be really hard still being a teen and in school. However teens can still be great parents and in the long run everything can still work out , some of the best parents I know were young parents.|`|VbUpMxrvaa	Society today is ridiculous.  The end.|`|8NFLpbJAaa	Heyy (: I think I remember you ??? x      Teenage Pregnancy:  It's their choice & people shouldn't treat them any differentley/shun them because it's like racism ? treating someone different because they had a kid ? & I don't think because your young doesn't mean you can't stay in love.    I'm suprised if that made any sense but I tried !!!! xxxx      EDIT:  3 thumbs down, jeeeseee people , everyones entitled to an opinion, just because it isn't the same as yours doesn't make it wrong, I was just answering the question.    EDIT:  Okay I'm an idiot , i tried.|`|11Mq2H4oaa	I used to love barbie....    About teen pregnancies, I think it's not the best idea for your education and jobs, but if two people love each other and want to settle down and live together, well, why not?|`|iQ70p3nJaa	my opinion is that if you're responsible and can deal with a baby by yourself and the baby will grow up in a healthy household, then it's okay.    But the thing is, most teens aren't ready yet because they haven't finished highschool or college yet. but there's always a chance to finish college while you have your baby, it's just 10x harder. And you also don't get to do the things you've wanted to do while you were still 'free'.    i respect any mother no matter what age who is working hard for their baby and making sure they're life turns out good...    but i don't want to get pregnant young because there's so many things i wanna do before i settle in|`|T9bCVRzVaa	Well I am in the same boat. I think I am pregnant and I have with this guy for 2 years. I am only 16. My opinion is that if you can take responsibility for opening your legs then you should take the responsibility of having and taking care of the child|`|HpCmmlMFaa	I don't disagree with teenage pregnancy, people always think that just because they are teenagers they can't look after their child and should have an abortion. I ate it when the parents are all like "you've brought shame to this family" and "you're having an abortion" but don't they think that this is their grandchild their daughter is carrying. Teenage mums can be just as good mums as a woman would is 26 but on the other hand a woman of 26 could be a worst mother then a teenager.   I just love the fact you're married at 16, it think it's great, Good luck in the future :)|`|kl8iDA5Iaa	It depends on the age of the parents.    I think if the Mother especially, is still at school it is a stupid thing to do. However if they had taken precautions ie the pill, condoms etc it's a slightly different story as it would be horrible to have an abortion.     Also I don't like when the grandparents are left to do a lot of the upbringing of the child. If your going to have a child, do it properly and take responsibility.    I don't think it's so bad when you're over the age of 16 as it seems your more of an adult and don't have school to worry about etc.
h57t7FAjaa	I really like both of the names, but I don't think they flow the best (too many syllables)!    some suggestions:  Abigail Paige  Abigail Mae (Abby-Mae, cute!)

Abigail I don't like, I guess Abbie/Abby is safe.  But since that's what you want, I'd choose a different middle name -- it doesn't flow so well.  Something like...  Abigail Rose  Abigail Grace  Abigail Violet  Abigail Patricia  Abigail Mary  Abigail Ruby  Abigail Jane|`|d6e11chxaa	I think it sounds really sweet. I don't care much for Abigail, but it is sweet and older-fashioned, just not my style. I usually dislike Madeleine, but it sounds really nice in the middle, and it's refreshing to see the correct spelling! If you're not set, how about:    Abigail Catherine  Abigail Camille  Abigail Genevieve  Abigail Lucille  Abigail Olivia  Abigail Rebecca  Abigail Rachel|`|ae9fc9a3eab22a6443df9b44ecb52d00aa	hmmm I am not so sure the middle name fits.      Abigail Jade  Abigail Winter  Abigail Elizabeth    i am not being much help, i no there are many that would go but I can't think of any right now, sorry.  good luck! :-)|`|3paE1E9Xaa	my niece's name is Genesis Abigail|`|b4J5jE7naa	like Abigail Madeline   and if you say both of their nick-names its says Abby Maddy lol|`|yJW00L9Haa	I like the middle name Christine. My friends name is Abigail and her middle name happens to be Christine. I also like Joanne. Abigail Joanne is very pretty.|`|X7u8DbV0aa	thats really cute and good luck!    here r some suggestions:    abigail michele  abigail reese  abigail lauren  abigail coraline  abigail kate      hope i helped!|`|qUS9Zwl6aa	Madeleine Abigail has a much better flow to it. Very beautiful. My daughter is Madeline Elise.|`|NZKiSfVOaa	Im not to sure on how Abigail Madeleine sounds- personally love them both but im not sure on how they sound together.   I think Abigail Elizabeth sounds better if you like traditional names , and its cute too, and cute origional, dont hear many people called that.(:      Good luck with the baby (:    *Edit*= I was reading throught the names that other people have suggested and the only one that has stuck out on being the best and cutest and just absaloutly beautifuly pretty name for all age groups, was by  *~?~* TTC  1! *~?~* he said a few names, but the one i find truly beautiful and pretty is Abigail Mae (Abby Mae) its just so so so lovely, words can not describe how much i love this name! Its Beautiful!    And you could even put Abigail Elizabeth Mae (Abbie Elizabeth Mae) so cute for when shes a baby and then grown up for when she gets older. Great for all age groups. Awhh awhh awhh!  Good luck x|`|pbfkYJ2daa	i like abagail madeline, it is really cute!!
WzY2WhGhaa	I am concerned that your daughter is focusing her anxieties into a feeding issue. I would highly recommend getting in touch with your pediatrician to see what they think and to get your daughter help for her feeding.    I would also refrain from going into too much details about the conflicts between the "adults". Children need to know that their world is going to be okay and they can really pick up alot from adult conflicts. What I would do is let her know that her grandparents are not dead, and make it clear and brief. I would also let her know that if she wants to talk to them on the phone she can-- for her sake. I know you guys had a falling out, but this is affecting your child so much that she needs to have some little bit of okay in her life.    Talk to your doctor and go from there, that's the best advice I can give.|`|d43e96506445ef1b6b4ace4380a9a5b4aa	i completely agree with the other poster that recomends going to the doctor. get her in now before it becomes a major problem. and yes, it is possible for young children to form eating disorders.|`|OlPwUM8aaa	Sounds like your daughter really loves her grandma grandparents?  No matter who had a falling out im sure it wasnt her and she does not deserve to be punished. If they are unstable you could take her meet them in a public park, pool etc. Sounds like it may be part spite and children should never be pawns or leverage. I dont mean that as an insult but if you see how distraught she is over this and they have always been good gparents in the past with adult supervision im sure she would be safe. Someone has to make the first move and for your daughters sake i hope it can be you
NwTggQ2Baa	i have 2 year old twin girls. When we have time to play together(i do not have much time because i just had sextuplets! very busy!) we play:  Hide and Seek  Dress Up-we use things we already have, like hats, jewelry, scarfs, etc.  read books  we sing songs  draw pictures  play simon says  we play clapping games and more.    we play a game called hot and cold, it is where you hide an object-we use sun glasses, and when they are looking it, if they get really close, you say:Your hot! If they get far away, you say: Your so cold!     we also play with they stuffed animals and dolls they already have.    I hope this helps!    also, go to this: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    you asked a question that was asked before. I answered and got the best answer.

GZ42ewEeaa	I like it for either. I think its unique when you take a more masculine first name and a feminine middle name for a girl. For example Noah Rose or Noah Grace. There are no rules anymore when you pick baby names certain names are clearly male like Michael or Matthew but some are great either way like Ashley, Shannon, or Noah.|`|4c747fd0be4c5e0f422ded5a0dc78cebaa	Better for a boy.    However, Noel can be either for a boy or girl if it is for a girl it looks better Noelle.|`|VGij9p0Taa	Please no Noah on a girl is yuck   Hooray Noah on a boy is great name, a good biblical name meaning rest and comfort its great for a BOY!   Maybe for a girl instead of Noah maybe Norah sounds like Noah.   Hope this helps|`|FLOjzbKEaa	better for a boy.|`|256cVXsmaa	Boy  it's adorable for both though actually|`|y4Uliyq3aa	Boy all the way!|`|pbfkYJ2daa	noah is a boy's name :]|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Boy.  edit...In every magizine I've read Noah Cyrus is spelled as I did, not Noa.|`|3paE1E9Xaa	i like it for a boy|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	It's a boy's name, clearly.  Never for a girl.|`|MCTyWCu2aa	Boy|`|d6e11chxaa	It works on both, but I have to admit, when I hear it, I assume it's a boy.|`|WSziasfMaa	Not really.  Its not very original.|`|ePPSBb5Daa	I usually think NOah for a boy but now that I think about it, it can work for both!!! :DD|`|tWKZVDG2aa	I prefer it for a boy.|`|rabjcdjHaa	I like the name Noah for a boy!|`|qBl07nnUaa	I've always thought of it as a boy name but I think it's pretty for a girl.|`|ZvASEWHPaa	I love it for a boy. Not for a girl though- it's a man's name in my opinion.|`|b4J5jE7naa	i like it more on a boy but i couldd be cute for a girl too like Noa Cyrus  it depends how its spelt if its Noah- boy if its Noa- girl|`|yJW00L9Haa	GIRL! evryon thinks its totally akward for a girl name. but i like it for a girl definately. i would call her Noah Lynne.

xNkmK0SHaa	I was not quite 10 when I had my first period.   My mother was never quite abe to help me with learning about it, but My girlfriend and I found a booklet while helping a teacher to clean out a cupboard.  We asked my friend's mother.  She called my Mom, who declined to be a pa    rt of the whole thing.  Fortunately, I did learn what it was all about before I started. I am so thankful that today our daughters can learn these things without Moms freaking out.  Back then, there was no need to explain about intercourse, conception, childbirth.  It simply didn't ever come up or become a problem (Ah, for the good old days).    I would be prepared for her first period almost anytime.  I suggest you tell her that much now.   After periods begin is time enough to tell her the rest of the story.|`|hJoB7VR1aa	It sounds like she is getting close, but usually a daughter will follow her mother. How old were you, your mother and grandmother. You might also take a look at the women in her father's family as well.|`|DNygQdmVaa	shes getn there.  I started my period at 11, And I have a cousin who started at 10|`|cR1WO8Lzaa	Maybe! - I started when I was 12 - but one of my best buddies started when she was 9-10 in 3rd grade.  It was difficult for her to be the only one going through this so young because all of her friends still weren't having to deal with it.   I've also heard something lately , some type of statistic, that girls are starting at younger ages and it's kind of a mystery.    Good luck.|`|cebac9a9fdb5738e1c4f5532e30fff77aa	its not impossible when a girl of nine can have a baby they usually say when they get hair and boobs give it 2/3 years and they will start their periods if she has been told all about them don,t worry|`|mWH1Gfybaa	It sounds completely normal! Shes just growing up lol I started when I was 11 and my grandmother started when she was 9. Like a couple of the others said, look it up in your family history. Good luck with your preteen!|`|1wf9R8sraa	I was a late bloomer.... 15 actually, but my best friend started her period at 10.  Her doctor told her it was hereditary and probably runs in the family.  But if it concerns you that much, I would consult your family doctor.  Puberty is unpredictable
EHY3FnAmaa	I would rather be single and lonely then you can still find "mr. right" rather than putting the children through a divorce ....  btw- I am happily married|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I think on some days the grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence.  That said, I would rather be single and lonely.  Happiness is extremely important to me and for my children.|`|TQW5E6olaa	So either way I'm unhappy? If that's the case, I refuse to pick.    I've adjusted pretty well to being a single mom. It's my life, why not embrace it and be happy with what I have? Envying other's isn't healthy. Yes, many of my friends are married. To each his own, their lives aren't perfect either. No I don't get lonely, I have a great job, an amazing daughter, a good support system and good friends.     You need a mommy day, go get your nails done, see a movie, take a nap, read a book, etc.|`|AA11210211	I would rather be neither but if I had to chose it would be single parent and lonely.There are ways to overcome loneliness where the alternative to a crappy marriage is divorce which is horrid.|`|AkFag8tNaa	I'm married (happily) w/two kids. I was at one point a single mom w/one kid. I'd say being single because it's just a huge struggle to enjoy life when you're not being loved by the person you live with.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	I'd definitely rather be where I am right now.    Sure, it gets lonely, but I'd rather be lonely than miserable!|`|0VJE7BXmaa	Married.  My kid's happiness comes before mine.|`|170DwLM5aa	Sigle Mom...     Life is too short to be with someone I dont love and Im not happy with.  I would choose to be singe and enjoy my child and go out and have fun once in a while.  When I used to be single I do remember some lonely times but they pass pretty fast.|`|veO1RXrCaa	I would never ever want to be unhappily married.  I said if He or I wasn't happy we should part ways or at least try to fix it.  Especially with kids involved.  So option 2 is what I would rather.  Even though neither are appealing.  :)|`|B9KwqnuDaa	I would rather be a single parent and lonely. Being in an unhappy marriage is unhealthy and it would be a bad environment for my kids.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	I love where I am at (in my 30s with children and happily married), but if I had to choose between those two choices, I would SO rather be lonely than unhappily married.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	I would much rather be single and lonely than in a miserable marriage raising Jamie. Which is why I'm not married!    I get lonely NOW (at 20 lol). But I don't want to drag him through a divorce, or raise him in an unhappy home. Its not good for them (relationship wise) in the long run.|`|AA11109728	I am 30 and a single mom.  I've never been married, but I have been unhappily attached.  Being single does get lonely sometimes, especially when others around you are married or in relationships, but for me right now the benefits of being single far outweigh the negative things.  I was much happier when my bf (my child's father) and I split than I was when we were together.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	I am a single mom and I had rather be lonely than to be married and unhappy.|`|i7oGjwJBaa	disclaimer:  i'm a very happily married mom (27) of 2 children.    i would  never wish to be unhappily married and trying to raise a child.  i haven't experienced taking care of my children on my own, so i can't compare.  but i know how important a happy home is to a child - and an unhappy marriage just isn't conducive to a happy home for my kids.|`|7aCH91ISaa	Single & lonely. I don't think it is good for the kids to live in an unhappy home. I was in a crappy marraige and when we divorced you could see the change in the kids. So I have been in both situations and Single & lonely was the better option.    Currently happily married to hubby  2, so you dont stay lonely forever.|`|zLyAh0qvaa	I just turned 30 and I have been a single mom for almost 4 years now.  I went through the pregnancy and everything by myself.  I just got back into a relationship a year and a half ago.  Sure I was lonely but I would rather be a little lonely then be married to someone I was not happy with because eventually you start to resent the person and kids cn sense that kind of stuff.  Staying married might only cause your child to have issues.  I really took my time this last time and while my bf and I aren't looking to get married right now I am happier then I have ever been and my son see's that.  And my bf has really stepped up and been a great father figure to my son.  I think my son would not be the same loving care free child he is today if I had stayed with his father.|`|mAPSl0DZaa	Im not really seeing a big distinction between the two. I have found that you can feel more alone with someone than without. You can be a single parent and not be lonely. Sounds to me like loneliness is associated to not having a partner. Our lives are filled not by just another person/partner.|`|AA10730513	I'd rather be single than unhappily married. After all, as long as you aren't tied down with Mr. Wrong, there is always the potential of meeting Mr. Right :)|`|GZdvHbT5aa	I'm with Johnny's Mommy, I'd rather be lonely than miserable.|`|1ZnzjCdlaa	I would rather be a single mom and lonely. I feel like that right now. I am 25, and in a relationship but it is long distance right now. So I am always lonely.|`|oyvOSYx9aa	Being single and a little lonely sometimes is better than being married and unhappy.   You have children to keep you company and you should enjoy them.   If you stay in a marriage that you are unhappy in you will never give yourself the chance to be happy with another man.  your only 29, you should have some fun. If you meet someone new you do and if you stay single for a while just enjoy it.  It can be lonely when you're on your own but there is no point making yourself miserable!|`|1L1AxWoXaa	It depends on how unhappy. If things were really bad than yes I would have to say I would prefer lonely and single. At least you can scratch that lonely itch from time-to-time.
ku618OyMaa	Before I even began the process I checked with my health insurance to be sure it was covered. I have Blue Cross Blue Shield HMO-I so I was refered to the RE I presently have. And they can't do anything unless its covered under my insurance. I have been going to see my RE since 12/18/08. In January he ran test such as HSG and a HSN and I had surgery to remove polyps near my right tube. I haven't seen a bill yet, which may only be my percentage I'm suppose to pay anyway. I am on treatment now. 100mg of Clomid for 5-9 days of cycle and to come back on 11th day to see of follicles developed. Then we have sex. But under my insurance only three cycles of clomid are allowed. I had two already when I was seeing my OB and it didn't do anything due to my blocked tube and because I don't ovulate on my own. So we are praying that we get pregnant this month or next month. I hope this helped you.|`|x7WphuY5aa	give it a try and find out how much it is when you go but i would try atleast once|`|HCmAoNjzaa	I am so glad you asked this question! My obgyn told me that she will leave me on Clomid for 7 cycles (I have finished 4 already) and if I don't get pregnant she will send me to an RE but I'm so fearful of the cost. I can't wait to see what answers you get.
wWeMH5oraa	In some women these are symptoms of PMS, in some women they could be symptoms of pregnancy. Only one way to tell though, take a test! And just wanted to say good luck to you and your husband with trying for a baby :)|`|rqOIqO7Raa	That is really hard to answer! It maybe even too soon to be having symptoms. It could be but it really doesn't sound like it to me. Give it a couple of weeks and if you are still feeling sick I would buy a early detection test and give that a try. Best of luck to you!|`|a6103b5448a81b3f2d761f035154c522aa	It might be pregnancy and it might be nothing.|`|6yy0jtzDaa	Patience is something you are going to have to learn lol if you are you have to wait 9 months to meet them and if not it will be long just let it take its course

Lovers or sibilings?    As for lovers you should choose names that are the complete opposite.  Ex: Fiona & Thomas  They have different parents so they'll have different names. Also you ahve to think about what time period they were born in (i.e: 20's, 70's, 90's, medieval) and look for names from that time period.    But if they're sibilings, then names that are kind of alike should be used. Like common names or different names, but not one of each. Like: Maryanna & Benjamin or James & Katherine.|`|QxmkDSGtaa	Adam & Lindsey  David & Jessica|`|wNZ95AK3aa	jude an lucy|`|CBN10TUKaa	Michael and Caroline  Michael and Carolyn|`|yJW00L9Haa	BELLA AND EDWARD!!!!! :)|`|CJp2iKpcaa	Brittany & Brian  Stacy & Logan  Chelsea & Chad  Sarah & Anthony  Michelle & David  Bonnie & Clyde(lol)  Cindy & Mike  Tina & Travis  Julie & James  Tina & Tim  Christina & Julian  Cynthia & John  Brittany & Kevin  Jennifer & Ben  Jennifer & Brad  Angelina & Antonio

HCmAoNjzaa	I just had one Dec. 22 and it wasn't pleasant by any means but it was worth it for the peace of mind that I didn't (Thank the Lord) have any blockage. As far as a pain scale   i would give it maybe a 7. It was painful and I cried while laying there on the table (which was embarrassing) it wasn't just the pain that got to me it was fear of a blockage, the vulnerability of just laying there while they do this to you & the pain on top of it. The pain only lasted maybe 3 minutes. It was worth it though.|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	I had mine done last March.  The best thing about mine was that it was over quickly (about 5 minutes).  It was uncomfortable though.  It felt like sharp pinching/cramping and lots of pressure.  I made it through but I wouldn't look forward to another one.  I took 800mg of Advil 1 hour before per my doctor's instructions.  I also was prescribed antibiotics to take the day before, of and after.  The radiologist and assistant were super nice and she went over everything before we even went in the room.    She had me put a gown on.  I just had to remove my pants and undies though.  She then had me lye on the x-ray table.  The radiologist came in and explained things again and showed me the catheter, etc.  Then he inserted the speculum (same as with a pap).  He then swabbed the cervix to sterilize it.  Then he inserted the catheter.  I felt some pressure with this.  Just an odd feeling.  Then he inflates the small balloon at the end of it which felt like a sharp pinch above my pelvic bone.  This is to block the dye from leaking back out during the test.  Then he inserted the dye.  Which was more pinching and pressure.  They were taking digital xrays.  There was a screen that I could watch. This was a good distraction.  The dye showed the shape of my uterus (which was good) and then it flowed right into my left tube.  It wasn't flowing through my right tube though so he had me roll to that side before he inserted more dye (this was awkward and more uncomfortable).  But then the dye eventually went through.  Then he removed everything and I had spotting for about 2 days with just some minor cramping.    You may want to take your own pad because the dye leaks out for a while.    Try not to stress and relaxing your muscles and breathing really helps during the test.    Best wishes!|`|ku618OyMaa	Well I had my done on January 8th. And it was the worst pain I had to go through thus far. The procedure itself wasn't bad as far as the catheter and the balloon but when he put the ink into the tubes. It hurt me so bad, he was asking me questions so that I won't faint. Come to find out my right tube was blocked by a huge polyp and other little polyps but I had then removed on 1-20-09. Now we are starting treatment and my ovaries and tubes are fine.|`|j9axB0YMaa	I had one a year ago and it sucked! I remember they sent me a pamphlet in the mail ahead of time that described the pain as "menstrual like cramping" what a load of bull.  During the procedure they will tell you to cough, when you do they will insert the catheter and balloon through your cervix. This hurts but it's not horrible. Then they start injecting the dye and your uterus starts contracting hard to try and push it out, this hurts bad! I started shaking uncontrollably from the pain and a few tears involuntarily fell out. On a scale of 1-10 I think the pain was an 8. I want to say it only lasted a minute in a half maybe two. After the test I went to the restroom and there was a lot of blood in the toilet. On my way out I vomited in the parking lot. If you can get a hold of some pain killers I would recommend taking some ahead of time. If not goggle how to do lamaze breathing and use that. Good luck.|`|3aV4lcCqaa	unless you have a blocked tube it shouldnt hurt. i got a blocked tube and screamed lol cos the pressue - once they stop though the pain stops immediately.. but like i said if there isnt any blockages it should be ok.  i had an old man do mine so it was a nightmare from the beginning lol x|`|tvBirM5Taa	It wasn't painful to me, but I have high pain tolerance.  I guess it helps when you take the recommended amount of ibuprofen before the procedure.  You should have  gotten instructions already from your doctor.  It kind of felt like a pap smear but a little more intense.      After 3 rounds of clomid, I had an HSG last year and ended up pregnant 2 weeks later!      It could happen to you.  Good luck!|`|Yl79igD7aa	Ouchies.  Poor baby, I know you're looking for reassurance and none of us are giving it to you.  :(  I'm going to continue the trend.  Before I had my HSG, a friend of mine told me it wasn't that bad so I went in expecting a few cramps and nothing more.  Wrong.  I had even taken 600mg of Motrin beforehand because I remember the pain I felt having an IUD inserted and I wanted to try to prevent as much discomfort as possible.  While the Motrin DEFINITELY helped with the cramping afterward (and I highly recommend taking some), it really didn't seem to help during the HSG.  It was quite painful.  I had a male doctor and a female tech and the tech was really sweet.  She gave me her hand to hold and instructed me to breathe...and it really helped having someone there giving me instructions that I could focus on.  Try to really focus on breathing deeply, in and out, and it will somewhat distract you.  At one point, the doctor asked me to turn to my right side and then to my left and I looked at him like he was crazy.  You want me to do WHAT?!?!  But I managed to do what he asked and, truthfully, the procedure is quite short.  Maybe a minute, minute and a half.  It hurts but it's over quick.  See if your husband can go with you in case you don't have a nice tech like I did.  Good luck, honey.
JpE5ELbqaa	Mine did the same thing a couple of weeks ago.  If she won't take hydration drinks, try Gatorade or Powerade.  If she's eating and drinking okay and is not running a fever, then it's probably just something that needs to pass through her system.    If she doesn't get better by tomorrow, consider taking her to the doctor.  They can prescribe some granules to put in her food and drink to help put the good bacteria back in her digestive track.
rdpZrBc9aa	Not long!  Depends how big he is to start with, and how fast he grows.  My daughter for 6 months, my son for maybe 2.|`|0DUzshQUaa	Gosh I don't think my son got out of size 1 diapers til he was almost 5 months. He is 7 1/2 months old now and wheres size 2 diapers.|`|ba1de16220287f2a6ca02288c1a71636aa	It depends on how was they grow.  My son was wearing size 1 diapers in the hospital and continued to where them for about 5 wks.  He has been in size 2 since then--he will be 3 months old on the 10th.|`|9EdJHqKHaa	depends on the baby. Each child grows at different rates, and the size of the child at birth also makes a difference. My niece was premature and very tiny so she wore very small sizes in everything for a really long time.|`|LMkj8D8eaa	****, my son is 16 months, and still can fit in a 2 !|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	mine did for like a month... if that|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	mine did for  along while like 3 months|`|HXfHkoSHaa	Depends on the baby.  My son was over 10 lbs at birth.  He was in size two's within a few weeks.|`|HvALvdc7aa	Mine started with the size 2 at about 6 weeks.|`|wKYdIaZVaa	It all depends on how much the baby weighed at birth. My daughter weighed less than 6lbs at birth so she was in size one until she was 3.5 months old!|`|4ksa4lhWaa	Size 1 oh wow ummm well right now my son is 5 months and whears size 2-3.      Up to 2 months then I got size 1-2.
C55pji5Qaa	Sounds about right. At 30w3d our girls measured at 3lb8oz and 3lb2oz. But ultrasounds are usually off. If the doctor is not worried I would not.|`|FgAPXhVRaa	I would say that is around average because I have read that the last weeks of pregnancy the baby gains about 1/2 lb. a week, so your baby seems fine to me. Although if you are really concerned, call the doctor. I would assume that he/he would have said something to you if there was something wrong with the baby's weight though! Good luck!!!|`|zWB3jHHPaa	ur 36?   you cant just say that???|`|e8HCEZDpaa	Go to babymed.com and from there you can choose pregnancy calendar, and then choose baby weight in ounces, and it will tell you about where you should be at this point. You should be relatively close to where you are supposed to be. Also you can sign up at babycenter.com and they will give you that type of info as well.|`|WdRLgvw6aa	That is a little small but you still have about 8 weeks to go.  Both of my babies weighed 8 1/2 lbs when they were delivered.|`|52U22fiAaa	That sounds about right.  You still have about 7 weeks for baby to gain weight, and the baby will gain the most in the last month.
BDnSmRE6aa	I had this, went to the hospital and they did a swab which came back confirming a yeast infection, but it's always best to get it checked as soon as possible.  When i went to the hospital they were concerned in case of premature rupture of the membranes.|`|Iqifd3SGaa	That sounds like an infection or you lost a little bit of your plug.|`|f09e072268dcadec92ad927da92bcfaeaa	either mucous plug or chlamydia, it causes a green discharge - call your ob! good luck!!|`|AA10930398	The only time I saw that was when the 'plug' was coming loose. But that was a couple days before I delivered!|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	It sounds as though you have an infection or an STD. Green discharge and itching isn't normal. Gonorrhea causes a green discharge and itching. I am not saying it is an STD but if it is, you can pass that your baby if it isn't cleared up before delivery.  Women who have gonorrhea during pregnancy tend to have higher rates of miscarriage, infection of the amniotic sac and fluid, preterm birth, and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). If they pass it to their baby, Newborns develop gonorrhea most commonly in the eyes and may eventually go blind if left untreated. This is why most states require that all babies be treated with medicated eye drops or ointments soon after birth as a preventative measure. You need to see your Dr again. Better safe than sorry. It is quite possibly just a bacterial infection. On my "safe list" from my OB it says in big bold letters ~NO DIFLUCAN~  so you probably shouldn't take it again unless your dr says to. Diflucan is a category C in pregnancy. Meaning it may cause harm to an unborn baby. I would speak to your OB. Best Wishes!|`|3XFZHhWgaa	I was always told green is dry blood...but it could be from the yeast infection as well, but I think your fine since its not red blood. I dont think you hsve anything to worry about, but if your still not at ease, call up your doctor.
OlPwUM8aaa	My best friend had a 5 yr old daughter with the same problem she was a very intelligent little girl and they had started having some pretty bad family issues. I believe the little girl was picking up on the stress and having a child version of an anxiety attack. Shel told me when she would have them she would sit in her room with her very quiet with the lights out and brush her hair with her hands, rock her whisper to her and have her breath slow deep and count. Eventually they became shorter duration and the little girl could manage them on her own.  She may need your help for a bit but having that moment will let her know you are there for her and strengthen her for the times you cant be right by her side.|`|CMqOpaYSaa	(from mother's fiance)    Not only that but the child says things like "i want to breathe", "make me breathe", and "I want to calm down".    Could this be a Psychological Issue?|`|h5W2IiSIaa	Hi,  My 5yr old has always had problems dealing with her emotions. I found a book called The highly sensitive child. really helped me understand her. We have a system now that works, when she is in a tizz I leave her for a few mins to see if she can regain control.If not either by my judgement or her asking, we sit I rock her & just say calm down in a calm low voice.Once she is focused on my voice I say breathe in & out & then do it myself. It sounds weird but it really works for my little one.She had a bad accident last year & this system worked right through the xrays etc. She may need help to overcome some of the traumas she has been through but on a whole try this book & getting her to focus on your voice. It may take a while for you all to get used to it but work with it    Good luck|`|0VJE7BXmaa	It sounds like you are not coping well with the stress, either.  Maybe you all need to build your support system.  I would reccomend moving back in with your mom, or visiting her more often.  She feels unstable at the moment.  Constantly reassure her that everything is okay, and model healthy coping skills in front of her.  Take her out for walks, keep busy, and enjoy life.  Focus on helping your fiance's rehab, and talk to her about the process.  Everything will settle down soon.|`|2d281c378a62cabf9789c151186cae74aa	It sounds like she may need professional counseling.  That's a lot of changes for anyone to deal with!  Since it is happening worse since the accident you may be able to have your insurance pay for it.  Call your pediatrician and let her know what's going on and she can recommend things for you to try.    Best of luck to you|`|IgEbbLcyaa	I'm so sorry to hear your bad news. Your little girl has a lot to deal with and she is still very young. I don't want to seem nosey but have you tried talking to a doctor. It must be very hard on you and your partner and I know as a mother it is worrying when you don't know how to help your baby. I had to make a space in my house where my son called his happy space as he has ADHD and he can take hours to calm down when he gets upset. I don't know whether this will help or not but it is worth a try. I hope you get some good answers here and good luck you really have a lot to deal with.|`|lPgwZzoWaa	Yes, sending her away WOULD mess her up even more!!  I am sure all of the changes in her life have cause some emotional issues.  You need to ask yourself....how calm are YOU???  The other people around her???  It truly sounds like she needs help, but you and your significant other need help too!!!  You are going through a lot and it may be rubbing of on your child.  Get into family counseling.  You will be happy you did!!    For right now, when she get out of control, sit on the floor with her and breath with her.  In a calm voice say,'Mama is here, breath like mama and we will calm down together'  Children learn best by example and love to mimic the adults in their life!!|`|GLnVPp2Caa	i have to say that from my own experience, children feed off of our stress and usually when they break down, it's an indicator that we are soon to follow.  they can see things that we are not willing to admit.    i wouldn't recommend giving her over to your mom because i think that is just going to make things worse.  she is having a hard time with all the changes, as you all are!    maybe she is feeling like he is getting more attention than she is or maybe she is scared of the wheelchair/walker.  how close is she to him?  maybe she's worried about his health.    she's 4, so you might try some one on one talk time with her.  try to regularly take her to the library to pick out a book (or someplace quiet) or a park and see if you can start communicating with her.  sometimes bedtimes allow them to open up too.  you can flat out ask, calmly not in the middle of a melt-down, what is bothering you?  are you scared that.....and give an example.    i am sure she is feeding off of your stress.  definitely don't get angry with her. i know it's hard, but it makes it worse, not better.      you are all soooooo tired and nerves are shot.  try to stay calm and be compassionate with her.    blessings.
DDFSITiYaa	My oldest slept through relatively young and we did a variation of cry it out at 3 months - only because she was already sleeping through.  When she'd wake, we'd check on her and then let her go.  Never fed.     My 2nd was very different.  What I ended up doing with her was feeding at one waking.  Then as she got older, I was able to wean her off that feed - probably around 8 mons.     My 3rd was kind of like the 2nd - I did the same thing and he was down to 1 feed at around 5 am at about 5 mons .  By 7 months if he woke, I didn't feed him, just checked on him.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	If by Ferber method you mean letting them cry it out - yes, I did that. My pediatrician advised me that once a baby sleeps through the night - if they wake up and cry it's only because they don't know how to comfort themselves - at this point it's best to let them cry it out and learn to comfort themselves. The key to using this method is that they have successfully slept through at least 1 night (that way you know they aren't waking up due to hunger). Once I knew they weren't waking up due to hunger I didn't go in at all if they cried - it took a few days but it worked great - my kids are much older now and all 3 are wonderfully adjusted great kids.    My oldest slept through the night at 6 weeks (on her own - not crying it out) - my youngest at 3 months (on their own without crying it out) but around 4 to 6 months they started waking up at night and crying - well I knew they could sleep through the night so I'd let them cry (after I checked on them to make sure they were ok of course)|`|488edafbffd854a7df677efa90768cabaa	I used ferber on my oldest when she was eight months old. I didn't feed her or even pick her up. I just laid my hand on her gently and spoke softly to her. After a week, she was sleeping peacefully through the night.     My youngest simply wasn't having it. She was probably 18 months or older before she would sleep in her own bed through the night and there didn't seem to be anything anyone could do about it.
SWxkfepuaa	when shes 16 you can leagly kick her out but there is a way talking to the council you can get a house for her befor you make her homeless|`|uP08b6K4aa	Honey you're not a bad mother, teenagers are hard work at the best of times!    Have you thought about approaching your local Social Services department or perhaps your GP who will be able to put you in touch with someone who may be able to help such as a counsellor or Social Worker.    She may feel unable to talk to you (kids rarely tell their parents what's really going on in their heads) but may talk to someone out of the family circle.    I wish you lots of luck sweetheart, kids can break out hearts without even knowing it and it's natural for us sometimes to want to push them out and hope that it will solve the problem, unfortunately it won't.  Don't push her away, she needs you more than she realises and it's now time for you to ask for professional help to avoid her going completely off the mark in life.    Good Luck xx|`|a3MSSvdcaa	Your not a bad mom because obviously your trying!  Check around for schools for troubled children.  Or compromise with her.  Tell her if she gets her GED she can quit school that way she can get a job and start supporting herself.|`|cteyFJxhaa	I don't know where you live but in Canada I'm pretty sure you can toss her out of the house at 16.  It sounds awful but what else can you do?|`|nfOxiQ2zaa	Screw her.  Make her homeless and see how she likes it... If she doesn't like it, spit on her and laugh.
WlU3NFu6aa	http://www.orientaltrading.com/ui/search...    http://www.birthdaydirect.com/    my daughter's 1st bday was a butterfly and daisy theme. we had a big party and her centerpieces were vases with candy lollipops http://www.candywarehouse.com/daisypops....  and butterflies glued on the rim http://cgi.ebay.com.my/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?... I actually got the butterflies from orientaltrading.com but i couldnt find them on the site. perhaps they are out.    ETA~I didnt want to do the regular princess or pooh or some overdone character either. thats why i went with butterflies.|`|uLeg1Aniaa	If you can't find any in the stores that you like you could look in a few magazines.  Oriental Trading for example has a whole magazine that is devoted to birthdays.  They have some in their magazine that you can't find in the stores.  If you don't have time to wait for a magazine to arrive you can also order on-line which is convenient.      http://www.orientaltrading.com/ui/browse...    I have to say though that if she is going to let a butterfly loose for every year of her life then a butterfly theme would be perfect.  It can start the tradition!|`|nfzQkvqraa	If you're willing to buy online, go to www.orientaltrading.com.  They have cute stuff for cheap. I think there may be a butterfly set on that sight too.    EDIT:  They do have butterflies.  Just search under first birthday party supplies.  I don't know if you'll think they're cute or not but it was worth a try.    I order from them all the time.  They send out catalogs before every major holiday if you order from them.  It's nice.|`|NA8dcyevaa	The Dollar Tree is a great place to find party decorations.

These are two great places especially during times where our dollar needs to be stretched as far as possible.|`|HG5ih7Mgaa	instead of taking your "precious valueble time" on writing a useless stupid moronic impudent ridiculous crazy dumb lame and stpid question, how about going to a party store like a person with some brain cells in their head would do|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Check out ebay.

Was due for period on Tuesday, nothin so I thought this is it my BFP. Started in the middle of the nite last nite. I know they say if you have been trying for over a year or so then you should see your dr. I am getting frustrated with the BFN as well. I wish you the best of luck and lots of baby dust!!!
1ZGDnSX4aa	yes just because your parents left you doesnt mean you should be scewred if you get sick! plus they would have it if the didn't have such bad parents, thats not their fought why punishne them!|`|XLsnuAqmaa	yes, someone has to pay for them to have health care.  it isn't the child's fault that their parents were addicts or unfit or whatever and they were taken away. or that they were given up.|`|5UoLngxfaa	yeah because if they didn't then who would, i was in foster care and if they didn't pay for that stuff then i would have never been able to have my daughter.
GLnVPp2Caa	I think boys should pee standing up.  They should also learn how to aim and wipe the rim when they miss.  Not teaching him THAT would be a disservice to his future wife.  LOL|`|Ke9gAvJTaa	My four year old stands to pp. And when he has to go, He takes his pants off where ever he is to go.  Sometimes you don't agree with parents. Hes your kid. not hers.|`|4gZYucHMaa	My goal for toilet training my son was just to get him on the toilet and I heard it was easier to do while sitting down...so that's how he's learned    but I am trying to get him to stand up so he can pee like daddy but he's too short to reach the toilet accurately so it's easier to keep him sitting.    However as soon he's able, he'll pee standing up...I wouldn't want to forbid him but I have heard some guys do like to pee sitting down ...heck when I was in college I knew a girl who peed standing up....had massive penis envy, and always trying to proof she was just ''one of the guys''!|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	I don't think it's an important issue at all.  Where does it say in the rulebook that men have to pee in a certain position?  If it's easier to have him do so sitting down, then let him sit.  When he is more, um, developed and may dangle in the water,  he'll stand for sure.    And why is her DH a eunuch for getting a vasectomy?  It's a lot easier for them than it is for us.  Superficial vs deep abdomenal surgery.  I think he's a considerate prince and should be accorded a lot more respect than he's getting.|`|3paE1E9Xaa	Nope you're right, I totally agree w/u my husband and I are teaching our 2 yr. old to stand to pee too!|`|3K7ffKn2aa	Whatever i would teach him now so he can learn how to aim. lol does she really think he's gonna be a teenager sitting down like a girl? His friends will kill him (i mean like tease not literal)!! come on grandma.|`|TawyLobZaa	Interesting question. Yes, I think it is emasculating. Regardless of how a boy would pee naturally or how they would be taught to do it, they are being taught that something they are doing is dirty.|`|KFtxaISsaa	Your mon is funny. I expected she would tell you something totally different. I don't think it matters that much. When he knows he has another option, he'll choose what he prefers, and when he starts school, it will probably be the 2nd.|`|cJLVPyAFaa	My ex-husband was taught to urinate standing up however he was taught to sit down if he got up during the night to prevent a mess from a half asleep kid. Made perfect sense to me|`|3d7413e991732aa7cbba574864c37217aa	I don't think it's emasculating for a toddler who is just learning and stands to fail more easily by having to aim and hit the potty - ahem, pun intended. I think physical skill should determine when a boy stands at the potty, and I expect that should come at 4 or 5. I think it would be emasculating to forbid a boy to stand to pee, if he were inclined to do so.|`|CMqOpaYSaa	From a mans point of view i'd say yes....Sitting to pee for man is uncomfortable at times for some men...Not to mention I personally think it is a luxury to be able to stand.....one word.....Camping.|`|EdCgeNYDaa	We're training my 3-yr old son (he's a late bloomer).  So far, it seems he prefers to stand when he is trying to urinate.  I don't know if sitting is emasculating, but I do think most boys want to copy daddy, not mommy.|`|ekAH05qWaa	i defineltey thing a guy should stand up to pee...its just the way things are suppose to be!

da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	these people are so stupid my mom breed and raised these we had over 15 and my mom had including me 4 kids and none of them ever ever attacked us they slept with us at night to protect us and woke us up in the morning to get ready for school|`|Z7V7AbBQaa	I use to know a guy that had a pit bull that as a kid I would pet every day on my way to school. This dog was the most well behaved and gentlest  dog I had see (the owner gave me dog treats to feed the dog) & I walked the dog on weekends.     About 3 years after I met the dog it suddenly was gone one morning so I asked the owner where the dog was and he told me the dog was at the pound in quarantine and after that was up she would be put down  because the dog attacked his 9 month old. Th baby was in his bouncer playing when the dog went up to the baby they thought the dog was going to give the baby a kiss like she always did but they were wrong the dog bit for no reason..    After this I will not allow any of my children around a pit bull because even the best behaved pit bull can turn.   I live in Ontario Canada an we had a pit bull ban now.|`|heDtLdz5aa	i do not trust pitt bulls...i would get rid of them as soon as possible...|`|bd22ca32eb55bc06eaa923b22bd0e54aaa	Just make sure the dog is supervised at all times around the baby. I have a Doberman that is very well behaved but still don't leave her unattended around my 7 week old. I don't even let my 5 pound Yorkie around the baby if we're not right there. The dog's probably not just going to attack the baby for no reason, but they're dogs and they can be unpredictable.|`|M9ApBTYvaa	We have rottweilers and I would not trust my beloved dogs with my 15 month old grandson.  It's better to be safe than sorry.    When grandbaby is at our house, we lock the dogs outside in their fenced yard.  They cannot get to the baby.     Pit bulls reps are even worse than rotties so use your head and consider your child.|`|9e2d43d3ae63af8660a877c9ec79937daa	As long as the dog is well trained there should not be a problem. Pit Bulls are not as bad as people make them out to be. I had one when my son was a baby and never had a problem. If you do not want the dog next to the baby train the dog to give the baby space. You should be fine.|`|WmGNmPhwaa	Well I was very close with this family that had a pit and after she had the baby the pit would protect and love that baby every year till she was about five years old once she hit that five year mark the pit snapped and ripped half the girls face off. Its not the dogs fault it is a chemical that gets released in there brain. My advice is yes get rid of the dog before you get to attached.|`|6e1884100ea01ca5c165183590f92363aa	Pit Bulls can be safe with kids under the RIGHT conditions. But be aware that some dogs of this breed, even though well trained and socialized with children can be unpredictable, even after years of "good" interaction. There are cases of pit bull attacks on family members, and these were dogs that had played with the children for years with no problems.    If you are going to keep the pit bull:    1. Always supervise her interaction with your child  2. Teach your young child to respect the dog and be gentle with her  3. Don't let your child get into the dog's food or toys  4. Train your dog (you've already got this one down)  5. Never force your pit bull to remain in an uncomfortable situation or with a person he's acting "weird" around.|`|l5A9QXVzaa	Pit bulls are not a safe dog to have around babies and definitely not newborns. They can turn on full grown adults so imagine how they can turn on a child.|`|IngripgMaa	Although I am a true animal lover, I would not feel comfortable with a pit bull in the house.  I love them, but they do have tendencies to "Snap".  They could be the most loving animals and have the best temperment....but when they snap, they snap.  Be Careful.|`|ApdzBnx2aa	I have a pit puppy (girl). any dog can turn at any time but pitts,especially females, are protective and territorial. Just be careful when introducing the baby to the dog. don't let the dog get too close to the baby tho.

My kids jump on her and pull her hair.  She doesn't even move.  She'll actually go in and lay in the middle of all the kids playing just to get the attention from them.  Her son actually stuck a plastic screwdriver toy up the dogs nose.  She cried Little and needed to have it removed at the vet, but never snapped at him.       However she had another pit bull before her that was a rescue dog.  He was always really good with the kids.  One day my sister was playing with him and left the yard.  The dog whimpered so my sister walked back in to pat him and he bit her leg really hard.    It all depends on the individual dog and how they are raised.  I dont think Id rescue a pittbull because yo wouldnt know its back ground.  You just have to ue your judgement and any dog can snap, no matter the breed.  Dont put the baby in a swing around any dog though, for some reason dogs can snap and attack the swing and the baby.  Weird, but it happened a bunch of times before I had my daughter so I was always aware of it|`|WlU3NFu6aa	you are only 6 weeks pregnant you have loads of time to figure out what to do  we have a pitbull. she's loving and thinks shes a baby. BUT, she's still a dog. When my daughter was a newborn I would not let the dog get too close. And now we still watch her like a hawk. We dont completely keep the dog away because she may start to feel isolated because of the baby and I'm afraid she will take it out on the baby. So she can come close but if she gets too friendly and rowdy (she doesnt realize shes such a big dog) she is removed from the room.   Even the tamest pitbulls ahve been known to attack. Keep the dog away from baby. Introduce them so the dog its too curious as to what is being kept from her. BUt dont let her get too close and never let them out of your sight.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I have met some nice and well-trained pit bulls, so I don't want to dismiss an entire breed.  The issue with pit bulls is that if they do show aggression, their physiology gives them the potential to be deadly.    In this circumstance however, I would not let the dog near my baby.  You have no idea if it has been trained to be aggressive.  And, unfortunately, many people who own this breed of dog like them for their worst qualities.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	My family had a pit bull as the family pet, a male. When my sister got pregnant we were a little concerned how the dog would act with the baby since he had never really been around them. When my nephew was born the dog became very protective of the baby. He never turned on any of us or the baby. My nephew would hit the dog, and try playin with him and everything and the dog would just get up and move to another spot. So we had a great experience with ours he was very good with the baby and he was protective of the baby. Hope this helps. Good luck. Pit bulls have gotten a really bad name but they are good dogs if they are trained well. If you feel this dog is trained well then I wouldnt be worried. They are great dogs and they will take care of you and your family.|`|M5E3mDBJaa	It all depends.  All species are very protective of their young.  If your baby was around here when she had pups and were to get too close she may be snapped at or worse.  I would voice your concerns to your boyfriend and see what kind of arrangement you can make, weather it's keeping the dog confined or finding her a better, more suitable home.|`|vue9NOhYaa	I am far more concerned about your boyfriend's decision to go into dog breeding to 'make some extra money.' Any responsible breeder will tell you that the costs involved in breeding dogs and caring for the puppies correctly result in a VERY modest profit at the end of the day.    Dogs are dogs.  No baby or young child should ever be left alone with a dog, regardless of breed.  If the dogs in question are well bred, well socialized terriers (as opposed to 'pit pulls' raised/bred for fighting) then there's no more risk than with any other dog of comparable size.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Using the pit bull for extra income ? Breeding more animals that you don't trust around your own child? That doesn't sound very smart.   I would keep your dog since it's a responsibility you have taken on before the baby was even a thought but keep them separated. Keep the dog outside if you can and don't leave them unattended together.....    Good Luck....|`|yB8djbeNaa	pit bulls are extremely dangerous and are banned in the UK, I would not advise to have your child around a pit bull|`|627pWyVkaa	If your dog has already been around children, and babies and is well behaved I dont think you have to worry. its how people raise their animals that cause them to snap. Most dogs will not just attack someone for no reasons without being provoked. I would try introducing your dog to children first (maybe friends ect) just so she can be use too the loud Sounds or screams (that may frighten her). And as long as you make sure she can smell and bond with the baby I dont think you would have a problem if your afraid, discipline the dogs when they go near the baby so they stay away. and make sure you do not allow your dog or dogs to go into the nursery.|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	I'm a firm believer ANY dog should be strictly supervised around babies and toddlers and NEVER left alone together|`|2VtkgzcIaa	No matter how well trained your pit is, they can definitely turn at any moment. I would be especially nervous having my baby around a pregnant pit. Exactly how you were moody and hormonal, the pregnant pit is going to be the same way.|`|9Mr14w6Qaa	Myself I do not have a great amount of trust when it comes to pit bulls.In the past they have had a lot of bad press because of attacks from these type of dogs.I would be very cautious about having a baby around this type of animal.|`|U3prt8tlaa	I would never in my life have my baby around a pit bull or any type of dog for that matter. I'm a dog lover and have always had dogs and have never had a problem with a dog but when my daughter was born I said no more dogs. Every single time I hear of a dog attack weather the attack is towards another animal or human, the owner always says "my dog would never attack". The dogs that seem to attack all the time are the dogs that  would "never attack". They are so unpredictable and anything can set them off, even if they have never shown any signs aggression.

Depending on how far you are they will crush the skull, tear off the limbs, or poison your baby.  Think adoption.  Being pregnant and 15 will teach you a DAMN good lesson to keep your legs shut.|`|joPJtKemaa	Didn't you think about this before you had sex?|`|Jswomud7aa	They have shelters for single moms and agencies who will help you place your baby with an adoptive family. You don't have to go back to your dad... you are just making excuses in order to justify the decision you are making to kill your baby. Why make another mistake?    There are over 200,000 couples wanting to adopt a baby each year while ONLY 25,000 babies are given up for adoption.    It would be really selfish of you to murder your beautiful little baby and flush it down the drain like garbage than to give it up to a loving couple who would do anything to have a baby!    Many couples will cover the cost of your pregnancy: food, housing, clothing, medical costs as well as give you extra money for the pain and suffering of pregnancy and labor... Call an adoption agency!|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	I am not going to tell you want to do or not do, so if you want to get an abortion you should contact planned parenthood and see if they will give you one without an adult present or without a parent present.  You will also want the think about the costs.  Which depends on how far along you are.  So just talk to a nurse or doctor from planned parenthood and tell them your situation and see what they can do for you.  Also if you are going to continue to have sex you need to talk to them about birth control so you are not in this situation again.|`|N83Po9PZaa	I got pregnant at 16. Abortion was not an option for me, but the father wanted to get married, so we did. I already had my mind set that if he didn't marry me I'd give the baby up for adoption. 13 years later I can tell you I'm still comfortable with the fact things could of turned out different if he hadn't married me. So many people out there want babies and can't have them, you know.    P.S. We only stayed married for five years.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	You need to speak to a counselor. Did your Mom tell you that you would have to move out? And does she know your father is abusive? If he is abusive, why isn't he in jail. You need to speak to your Mom. Most mothers of pregnant teens are very angry at first, but they get over it. Give her some time. You will regret an abortion. You are ending someone's life. Your child. In GA one parent has to be informed before the abortion will be done. But please reconsider. I had a baby at 16. He is now 13 years old and I don't know what my life would be without him. I love him with all my heart.
yjXUE8bWaa	Going into the hot tub after sex might kill the sperm around the opening of your vagina, but chances of the hot water killing the sperm inside you are practically non-exsistant. Even if you douched, (which btw I don't recomend to any woman to do, because douching can push harmful bacteria into the uterus,) would not kill the sperm that have been introduced into the cervix. When a man ejaculates the sperm is pushed by the act of orgasm into the cervix. Some dont make it into the cervix, and is what you see that leaks out.   The chances of you getting pregnant from this can be, and are pretty good. When you ovulate, the sperm can live up to 3-4 days depending on the age and the health of the man. Smoking, drinking and overall health can affect sperm in many ways. If you are trying to get pregnant the best way to predict it without pressure on you and esp for your loved one, is this;; When  you start seeing the clear sticky stringy mucus in your underwear or on or around your vagina, that is the best indication you are ready to conceive. Sometimes counting the days works, but who needs that kind of pressure? Get to know your body, it will show you signs and signals. Like 3 to 5 days before your period, you notice the fluids that come out are more watery and thin? Then after your period your libido will usually pick up at about 5-7 days after. Usually the clear mucus will follow any where from that time up to 10 days after your period. The quicker you notice the clear mucus, thats usally the first day of ovulation. Which means your cervix is open and ready for conception. Blessings to you and yours.:)|`|NNwEuC8paa	They say up to 5 days if your cervix mucus is right for it to live in for that long.

39c2446b919f263832a80ca402b9f06eaa	The first answer was obviously written by someone who is NOT ttc because I can understand you perfectly.    I haven't had a lot of side effects from the clomid, although I do occasionally get the cramping and definitely the sore breasts. At first, when I was taking it, it seemed to regulate my period. Now my cycles seem a little longer and, with the sore breasts, etc, it is so hard not to get my hopes up.    Wait a little longer to test again. At this point, it's not very accurate. I, too, am a bit of a POAS-aholic so I know how difficult it is to wait for that missed period.

The pain can get out of hand sometimes....Just think of the end result :-)|`|ku618OyMaa	Well I had the same symptoms with 100mg of Clomid. I think my doc said the bloating is because of overstimulation of the eggs. Which meant that you produced a large number of eggs. Were you told to go back to the doc for ultrasound or blood test? I didn't become pregnant just very emotional and crazy.|`|T1hZG4O3aa	I did have the headaches, the backaches, the cramps, (I also had hot flashes) and i had horrible ovulation pain. But idk about the heartburn. I did have the sore breasts tho. It could also  be a combination of what you are eating and the reaction to the clomid. Not everyone has the same side effects. Have you read all the side effects listed, I dont remember, only took clomid the one time thank god. Good luck

tfTQ6Cuuaa	the first day of your missed period    some brands (first response) say you can test up to 4 days before your missed period but to be the most accurate i would wait until you are officially late.    and a late period and - test does not mean you are not pregnant, sometimes it takes some women up to 2 cycles before there is enough hcg in their urine to register as a +. a serum hcg (blood test your doc can do) is the most sensitive but again, wait until u are due for your period.|`|Mkgifu1caa	I would wait 3 days after your missed period because you could just be late, not pregnant.

i7oGjwJBaa	I say you need to cut back the formula so she's hungry enough to eat food.  if you just keep giving her what she wants she's going to keep walking over you.  unless she's got health issues there's no reason for a child over 1 to not be eating table food.  from 6 months we served our children the same thing we were having for dinner and if they didn't like it, oh well.  don't be afraid of her going hungry for a day - you have to show her that you are the adult and that you aren't going to cater so much anymore.  she will be more open to trying foods when she finds out she's still hungry after cutting back the formula.  my children never had formula - but as soon as they started table food my bm production slowed down.. to match the new requirement.. so they weren't going to get anymore breastmilk from me just because they didn't want to try the food.  it doesn't take long for them to learn.
264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	I only used the drops when I fed my daughter formula.  I'd just stick the drops right in her bottle, they helped a lot!  She didn't have gas at all whereas she normally did with formula.      It depends on your baby's age w/ burping.  I think I burped my daughter till about 6 months old.  She started burping on her own when she was ready to around that time.    If you are feeding breast milk, I would give the drop before the feeding.      And you use them when your baby has gas, that's up to you to determine.  Is your baby gassier in the morning at night or both?|`|M5E3mDBJaa	I used these for my VERY colicky son prior to each feeding and I didn't notice any improvement.  But, you never know until you try.  Good luck.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I use them and yes they have helped you can give it to them anytime but the best is before the meal so that it doesn't cause gas so give them their dose and then breastfeed switch boobs if you need to and then burp don't give them another dose in between the boobs unless you feel it is necessary.|`|9kPPmazoaa	I've tried Mylicon... doctors suggestion...    I personally don't think it works for my daughter So I rarely ever use it. Every once in a while I may give my daughter a little. But I have yet to see any gas relief, so for me they are pointless. But I hope everyone else has/had better luck with them.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Our son was very gassy and we relied heavily on gas drops.  As a matter of fact, we used to call them his dessert because we gave them to him after each time he ate.  He was bottle fed (I'm assuming you're breast feeding), so we burped him after each ounce of formula and then when he was finished we gave him the drops and then burped him again.  They were very helpful because they made the big burp at the end of feeding come quite a bit easier.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	Our Pediatrician recommended we use them, and they have worked for us.  We give them to him before each feeding.  Yes, we still burp him, it really has helped!  We call it the "fart medicine" lol.|`|0DUzshQUaa	My doctor told me to use them for my very colicky son, well he is 7 1/2 months old now and I am still using them. I have actually bought the walmart brand gas drops and they work just as good. You get more in the bottle and they are alot cheaper.  The doctor told me to give them to him before EVERY feeding. You can't overdose them on the gas drops. Believe me if they had not worked I would have been insane by now. lol|`|bd22ca32eb55bc06eaa923b22bd0e54aaa	We use them all the time. They have worked really well for us. We call it baby crack! There is also something called Gripe Water that works pretty good, but Mylicon has been the best. You can put it in the bottle or just give it directly to them. I just give it to mine when he seems gassy. I don't burp mine after i give them unless i put it in the bottle.
ztug2gLjaa	SIMON is most probably the Greek and Latin form of the Hebrew Shimon, from shama, which means "he heard." Some sources translate it differently, however, as "listening intently" or "obedient."     JACK is a pet form of Jacob, from the Hebrew, meaning "one who holds back another;" or a pet form of John, from the Hebrew, meaning "God is gracious; God is merciful."     RALPH is from the Old Norse and literally means "wolf-counsel," thus it has the connotation of "courageous advice, fearless advisor." Also from the Anglo-Saxon, where it means "home loving" or "hero."       ROGER is from the German name Hrothgar which literally means "fame-spear." Thus it has the connotation "famous, noble warrior." Also from the Teutonic, meaning "tall, straight."       This is the website where I got the meanings from.

Ariana Heather sounds nicer|`|BomQzrT1aa	Ariana Shay is very nice.    the other two are very common names.    I think it would look more special and feminine spelt "Ariana Shai" though.    Good Luck!!    Nikki,,xo|`|cSOkd7Umaa	stephanie Heather|`|tkWBinDhaa	Arianna Shae ;)|`|ae9fc9a3eab22a6443df9b44ecb52d00aa	Ariana but I don't really like Shay with it.|`|qfsVYQMraa	I hate both of them... Sorry.    Ariana Shay sounds like an inner city girl, if you know what  i mean.    And i don't like the name Stephanie at all.      Heather is quite nice though.|`|d6e11chxaa	I don't care for either, but I think Stephanie is a more solid choice, and much less common right now. Ariadne is a cool choice. It's the ancient form of Ariana.|`|8mQVfDRqaa	Stephanie is better but I don't like Heather with it.|`|YO1w7gpiaa	Both names are beautiful.    My vote is for Stephanie Heather|`|JO3j4fpXaa	Ariana Heather|`|r5UfVeYbaa	love Ariana but not with shay hb Ariana Heather or Ariana Stephanie are okay  Ariana Ellen or Ariana Elizabeth is beautiful!!|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	I don't like either, sorry.|`|ANVgXpQnaa	I WOULD GO WITH ARIANA SHAY, BECAUSE STEPHANIE HEATHER IS PUTTING TWO VERY COMMON NAMES TOGETHER.|`|RU6uI22Kaa	wat bout stephine ariana?|`|a7yQGSX6aa	Stephanie.Shay is stupid.|`|QxmkDSGtaa	I like Ariana Shay!|`|r8ETcmHMaa	I like Ariana, it's my daughters name.|`|Vf6SJPcqaa	ariana shay. Stephanie is waaaaaaaaayyyy too 90's.|`|qUS9Zwl6aa	Sorry I don't care for either. Ariana Shay just doesn't flow well with each other. And Stephanie Heather, doesn't either, it's like forcing to popular 1990's names together. Heather is pretty but not combined with any of these.|`|UySiU0LSaa	i hat them both. Choose something unique... Hazel? Zara? Jasmine?|`|DKvhvVsBaa	I like Ariana Shay, but would also like to suggest Adrienna Shae. Could call her Adri for short =)
ztzEloj5aa	Ask around to other women on the base or other wives... have you met anyone. There are also resources on the web that will tell you whether or not someone is hghly recomended.   Good luck- great ones are hard to find.|`|cebac9a9fdb5738e1c4f5532e30fff77aa	try asking someone in charge at the army base i am sure they can help they may even have their  own facilities on the base|`|AA12255473	Gynecologist dammit... what school did you go to?|`|YtFIAmCaaa	i havent quite finished medical school, or high school for that matter, but i could take a look for ya
upKzH6fSaa	yep, 3 out of the 4 tests i took gave me a positive before my period was due. you arent really gonna get a false positive, a false negative is a lot more likely. tests they make now are so much more sensitive and can detect the hcg hormone a lot sooner than they used to. if it makes you more comfortable, retest again in a week, your positive should be a lot more evident. hcg levels double every 48 hours or so. good luck to you and God bless|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I took mine before my missed period and it was accurate. If it's faint, it means the hormone is there but I'd take another one just to be sure and then go get a blood test to verify. Good Luck :)|`|jgtfWjE4aa	if it's barely there, you're pregnant.    my first test was that way and i'm 14 weeks and 2 days pregnant!|`|ostF23Omaa	no I would wait till after your missed period and take it again.  Good Luck|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Congratulations, Mom!|`|dGBrlJvgaa	Yes, you are pregnant. Congrats! Get in to see your doctor soon.|`|AA10626484	i took 3 pregnancy tests with my 2nd girl and they all turned out the exact way. a very faint line. it  was there and so was she!!|`|ltHKURBhaa	The test would be accurate before you period if the line is faint then yes you are pregnant i would make a doctor appt and get blood test did    good luck    Be happy you are going to have a baby
umGzyElZaa	My friend had the same issue. They scheduled her for a c-section. She ended up going into labor, he turned, and everything went perfectly! You still have a few weeks left. I wouldn't worry! Its normal for them not to cooperate until the last minute!|`|SRzswqTeaa	http://www.birthingnaturally.net/birth/c...  http://www.gentlebirth.org/archives/post...    Remember that baby may not be born for awhile, another month and maybe even a couple of more weeks, (or more! lol), so baby has a lot of time to rotate to an anterior position.  It might not even happen until labor starts, as many babies just need those contractions to turn that head differently.  stay out of recliners, spend time on your hands and knees, and watch your posture.  Read the above websites (and more if you would like), and you'll be set to go.  Take care!|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	Unfortunately, we were not aware my baby was in this position until I was a couple hours into labor. So I cannot suggest anything for you to do to help as I wasn't aware of the positioning problem so I didn't do anything to change it. I thought I would share my labor with you in case your baby decides to stay in that position!     My water broke at 40 weeks, 3 days and my contractions started almost immediately after that. I was dilating fairly quickly and was having horrible, horrible back pain. It was so painful I couldn't barely stand, it was crippling pain. I finally got an epidural at about 6 CM (about an hour after I arrived at the hospital) and was able to enjoy the next 4 CM and the first 1 hour of pushing was not bad at all. That is when they realized she was posterior. They shut my epidural off, yes off, so I could push with all my strength and work with the contractions.That was not a good idea. I was in so much pain I just couldn't handle the waves of pain that the contractions brought to my back and wasn't effective in pushing at all. They turned my epidural on so I was getting a very minimal amount and called in the on-call physician for a second opinion on performing a c-section. I then decided to try sitting on the "birthing ball". I had used an exercise ball at home to help relieve back pain and pressure. I sat on it and continued to push through the contractions, all the while swiveling my hips to get the baby to move even a little bit so I wouldn't have to have a c-section. Finally, I felt something move and I felt this overwhelming sensation to push. They made me hop back into bed and push with all my might, again they turned off the epidural but I just knew she was almost out so I tried my hardest to ignore the pain. I was completely exhausted after pushing for 2 1/2 hours total so my physician made the decision to use the vacuum extractor in helping her out. After the vacumm cap was on her head I pushed for about 20 minutes and she was then born, 8 lbs 14.5 oz! I had a horrible 2 days after the birth with back and pelvic pain, but it all eventually went away and I have no problems at all now. My baby is now 16 months old. I do not mean to scare you, I was just telling the whole story so you had some insight! Good luck, I hope baby turns!|`|fVpRVofLaa	My Dr. refused to do the "transverse" do to possible complications.I ended up having to have a C-Section.|`|pZg05uygaa	I had this too and my baby turned around by the time I went into labor.   Don't lean back in your chair when you're sitting. Keep your legs open and  lean down a bit so that your belly hangs. Spend some time on your hands and knees. Do pelvic tilts. Do a prenatal yoga class.   This website might be helpful: spinningbabies.com|`|o9u4H6m6aa	The other answer is incorrect. Posterior is not an ideal position. Left occiput anterior is. That means the baby should ideally be with it's back to your front slightly towards the left side.   This helps baby's head have the smallest diameter as it fits through the pelvic bones. In some ways, the size of the baby is not as important a factor as the position of baby's head in relation to mom's pelvis.    There are many books and websites that suggest ways to turn a posterior baby before labor and while in labor. Go to Google and type in Optimal Fetal Positioning.  Most of them involve positions for mom. If mom is leaning forward throuout the day in various activities, that gives the uterus more room and gravity encourages baby to roll forward into an anterior position.    A question I would ask is, do you do most of your activities in the day leaning back? Sitting back in a chair, in the car seat etc etc.  It is a good idea for all pregnant women to lean forward as much as possible. eg. sitting on an exercise ball with hips tilting forward, exercising on hands and knees (careful not to let the lower back sink down, though), climbing stairs to, stretching to gently open the pelvis.. When sleeping, sleep lying on the left side, or even sometimes kneeling leaning over a pile of pillows.  Check out the websites.    If you do, however, still have a baby by the time you get into labor, there are some things to consider.  There are many women who have birthed posterior babies with no problem, especially if the baby's head is small and mom's pelvis is big. There are women who have had posterior babies after a long and hard labor. And there are women who have had cesareans because their posterior baby could not fit through their pelvis, or their caregivers did not wait long enough.     There are 3 important things to consider.   1. Posterior labors can be more painful for mom's back because baby's back rests on mom's spine. So to deal with that, mom should get into upright or forward leaning positions as much as possible to take the pressure off the back. Hot showers aimed at the back, hot packs, or even ice packs on the back can help, as well as getting a support person to provide counter pressure. Counter pressure means pushing like hell on the spots that hurt during contractions. Many women find that very useful at relieving pain. It can also help to hire a doula, and stay home for as long as possible. Posterior labors tend to take longer than normal because the part of the head that's resting on the cervix isn't putting equal pressure on the cervix.    2. Staying mobile and changing positions in labor can greatly help baby to rotate from posterior to anterior while in the first stage of labor. The contractions of the uterus themselves encourage babies to rotate into a good position. Again, upright, forward leaning, lying on the left side positions. Moms sometimes know intuitively by listening to their bodies which positions feel best at which times. A position that creates intense and unecessary pain is in indication to get out of that position. Lying back, even propped up with pillows decreases the space in the uterus for baby to turn. Plus the baby will have to work against gravity. If baby is still posterior by the time mom gets to full dilation. In the second stage of labor (pushing), choosing a position that allows full expansion of the pelvis is a good idea for posterior babies. The pelvic outlet can expand up to 33% at birth in positions like squatting. Hands and knees, or side lying are great too if mom is to tired to get up.  Lying back or sitting are going to block the tailbone from opening fully.  Lying flat on the back with knees pulled up to the chest is also a way of expanding the pelvis, but then baby has to go against gravity to get out.    3. Your caregiver's experience and common practice. Some doctors or midwives are comfortable with women being in various positions for 1st stage and 2nd stage of labor, some are not. Continuous fetal monitoring, inductions, and epidurals can significantly hinder mom's ability to move around into comfortable positions.    Some caregivers are only used to  catching babies while mum is lying back. Sometimes posterior babies come out fine with mom in a lying back position, sometimes they get stuck. Some moms don't mind having a cesarean after laboring for a while with a posterior baby, some do. You need to suss out what how you feel and what is important to you. If you want to, discuss with your caregiver ahead of time, how he/she normally handles posterior labors, and how they feel about what you want.     Hope all of this was not too confusing! And good luck with your babe!    www.childbirthcentral.blogspot.com

The double n endings seems a bit abrupt. I don't like place names, and have you ever been to Cheyenne, Wyoming? It's a depressing place. It's also the name of an American Indian tribe.

5805bf3a9bb2e4808ef2d73593aaab11aa	My husband and I got pregnant when we learned the Billings Ovulation Method. Every woman is different, and even if you have a regular cycle, all sorts of things can throw it off (including stress, or change). This method taught me how to pay attention to my cervical mucus, basically. There will be one day when your discharge will be clear and slippery like egg yoke (sorry for the blunt description..) On that day, you are ovulating. Try being with your partner that day, and the three days following. (They're usually down for that) I went off the birth control pill in June, and we tried in Oct. It worked right away. If you want to read more about it in detail- here's the website. www.woomb.org  I really hope this works for you. Best of Luck!|`|AA11903455	I feel  you.  Relax a bit and just enjoy being with your man, it will come when it will.|`|ExVvNU8taa	Don't worry! Your timespan so far [four-five months trying] is well within normal limits. If you're in your 20s the recommendation is to wait 8 months to 1 year before conditions warrant looking into medical treatment. For those in their 30s, the rule-of-thumb is six months of trying. That is if you are using Fertility Awareness methods like charting BBT, observing cervical [fluid], monitoring cervical position, using OPKs, having sex every 24 hours during the week before & including ovulation, boxers, no hot tubs, blah blah blah... :-)    There is only a 20-25 percent chance of conceiving in any given month, even under optimal conditions (intercourse near ovulation, healthy egg & sperm, etc.) So you *do* have time -- it's not alarming that you haven't conceived yet.    http://www.pinelandpress.com/faq/lowtech...|`|oOBg9hshaa	it takes time and stressing about it only delays it further, good luck though|`|QB5D0rG4aa	I totally understand.

Dont read into it too much, and when too much time passes you can always go to the gyno and your mans sperm can be checked, just to make sure everythings good and then next would be fertiltity.|`|Zz1HI5VHaa	There are may possible reasons you have not conceived. if you were taking Birth control previously it can take 6-12 months for it all to be out of your system. The number one leading cause of infertility in women in the US is PCOS (Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome). The problem may lay with your husband.     I would suggest making an appointment with your OB to discuss testing. There are a few easy test they can do to determine if there are any obvious issues. most doctors will tell you that unless it has been 2 years with the same partner they do not consider this an infertility issue and to keep trying.    Good Luck!|`|0U9Lm5gmaa	Try when you're ovalating, and that's like two weeks before or two weeks after your period, also try having fun or something because most times it happens when you don't want it to, or just keep doing it every chance you get even if it's two minutes, and if that does'nt work then there must be a problem in houston, see a doctor. oh yeah eAT SOME FRESH OYSTERS I recommend you and your partner. GOOD LUCK.

DRb4Qlypaa	Your cervix will look differently, I believe it will have a different color to it and it might even swell up a little. That is the only physical change I know of.  Changes you may notice are more discharge and of different levels of thickness.|`|EzbJsE5eaa	When I originally thought I was pregnant, the doctor told me she was looking for a bluish or purplish color in my vagina and cervix. It's called Chadwick's Sign. That's most likely what he noticed. It's a common pregnancy symptom that a doctor can find during an examination.

DKqsFGymaa	I think you need to get her on a more consistent schedule.  You said some days she does not take a nap at all.  An 18 month old should be taking a nap.  If they get overtired, they can act in a manner such as you describe.    She should be going to bed between 8 and 8:30 p.m.  She should sleep for 10 hours per night.  Then, she should go down for a nap from about 1:00 p.m. until 2:30 p.m.  Every day!    If she wakes in the night, comfort her in her own bed or in the living room.  Do not take her to bed with you or you will get her in that habit and it's soooooo hard to break.    Good luck and stand strong!|`|CrjozlCjaa	Who is the parent here - you or her?|`|NNngnKK3aa	It's a phase most children go through around this age. Like most phases, like the Sucking Thumb phase, it'll end eventually. Just make up a small bed or campout like thing in your room so she can sleep near you. But not with you. It may help her. While she can be with you and your husband. She will know that it isn't her bed. It may help/|`|Y5c4uZ4Maa	Have you tried changing her sheets to her favorite cartoon character? Or putting her favorite toy in bed with her? As long as it isn't too big? My son did that, and when we let him pick out his own sheets he felt like it was his, and it worked, it took a few days but eventually he wanted to be a big boy and slept in his own bed all night, maybe giving her something of yours (like your shirt/sweater) to hold at night will help, if she is wanting to be close to you, then maybe something of yours will make her feel better, let her know that you want her to be big girl and that you love her and you are with her even though you have your own bed and she has hers, give her something to comfort her before she goes to bed and give her lots of kisses and hugs, try reading her a story lying next to her in her bed (next to the bed with your head on it, to be sure not to let her think you are going to sleep in her bed). Sometimes they just want to make sure you are still there, children seem to have security issues at that age, and who better to make them feel safe than mommy! Good luck sweetie.....they do grow out of it, some just take longer than others.|`|lPgwZzoWaa	What is wrong with her coming to bed with you for a little while??  Our son co-slept with us until he was 18 months old and then left our bed because HE wanted to.  They are only little once and you will miss baby snuggles!!  Also, there have been studies done that children who co-slept make more communicative teens.  I don't know about you, but if my 15 year old wants to come talk to me in bed because that is where he feels safe and loved I will KNOW  I have done the right thing!!|`|Q2Sx1Du3aa	my three year old went through the same thing for a long time. he loves the movie cars so we went a got him cars sheets and a blanket for his bed. we showed him what the sheets were for (his bed) granted, he still didn't want to sleep by himself, but quickly became comfortable with the idea and now if he lays with us in our bed all he does is play because he KNOWS his bed is for sleeping i guess..  your daughter will get used to the idea..but you have to let go of the fact you cant stand hearing her scream..in the long run your relationship with your husband will suffer..
veO1RXrCaa	My son was 17 or 18 months when he figured how to escape from his crib.  It was quite acrobatic and inventive how he did it.  He would throw his leg over the top, pull himself over the top.  And then put his feet on the rails and slide down them.  He must have had good upper body strength and legs/hip of rubber bc he was not tall enough to get his leg up there.  Anyhow we put him in a toddler bed. It was unsafe to use the crib.  And we wanted to keep the crib decent for the next potential baby.  Anyhow we put a gate on his door.  I also spent many a sleepless night laying on his floor to convince him to sleep there.  But anyhow it takes time and patience.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	No, it depends on her readiness but she sounds ready.  You can buy safety rails and/or other safety items to add.    My oldest went from his crib to a toddler bed at 17 or 18 months old.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	Our kids all moved to a box spring and mattress on the floor before age 2 (one of them closer to 18 months).  we put a safety gate on their door so they couldn't wander around the house in the middle of the night.|`|dGBrlJvgaa	I moved my son at 18 months to a twin size bed, because he was climbing out of his crib. It turned out great for us, but we do have a bed rail so that he doesn't fall out of bed.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	god no that is not to young my son went into his big boy bed when he was 18 months. I also have a 4/way crib bed thing. I put my youngest son in it as a crib because I think that as a bed bed it is kindof overwhelmingly big. I bought my son a little car bed and he loves it. It helps to have a bed or blankets off of what they really like. Good luck|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	We switched our son from a crib to a full sized bed at 18 months.  He's fallen off only once (and didn't get hurt).  So I would say go for it.  He sleeps so much better in the bigger bed.|`|AA10730513	Living situations weren't ideal with Cheyenne. She spent several nights with me in the big bed. But I converted her crib into a toddler bed when she was a little over 1 year old and she didn't outgrow that until she was 3. ... I think she could have handled it by 20 months old. But we shared a bedroom in my grandfather's house at that time, so space was an issue.     I know that the frames are cute, but do you really have to use it yet? When my daughter started sleeping in a regular bed without me, I put the mattresses directly on the floor so she wouldn't have as far to fall. At 6 years old, she still prefers it this way. Yes - it is a little inconvenient when you carry a kid to bed and the bed is close to the floor. But it's worth it not to wake up to a loud thump followed by screaming. ... I put the headboard and foot of her bed between the head of the bed and the wall. It actually looks nice and is easy for her to get on and off of.
sIhPpdv3aa	One of my first memories is doing this to my parents. I cried and cried until my dad cracked every night. After about a week of this my mother finally said, "No, you're sleeping in your own bed." I cried and cried, but they ignored me. I heard my mom say, "She's manipulating you! She has slept in her own bed all this time and now she can't? She just knows we're going to crack. If we don't, she'll sleep.  And she was right. I wasn't traumatized. I learned that night that my parents know when they are being manipulated. I learned that my parents make the rules. I learned that I am not the queen and I can't do whatever I want.    You are the parent. You need to be strong, and you need to set boundaries.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Several of my 4 children went through this at about this age too.  BUT I refused to let them sleep with me in my bed.... I just can't sleep with KIDS in my bed.  SO I bought them each a cute little cartoon character sleeping bag and in the middle of the night if they wanted to sleep in my ROOM then I let them come in - but it HAD to be with their sleeping bag&pillow in hand, without disturbing us  and they could lay on the floor beside our bed and they were HAPPY and content with this option.    That lasted for a few months or more maybe, and then THEY were ready in their own time and terms to go back to THEIR own beds.  BUT they still started out each night in their own beds - which still gave us a degree of privacy at night.  IT worked for us - maybe you can come to some simliar kind of arrangement/agreement with yours....  You would undoubtedly have to go through the MOTIONS with him/her at first - but they get the idea really quickly.  WHEN they have had enough of the FLOOR they'll go back to bed and be happy about it.  It gives them some CONTROL that they seek and gives YOU the control you need as well without the big fuss & fight.    After raising 4 kids I've come to believe that from birth on kids are just seeking independence, freedom and the ability to make their own choices and it's our JOB as parents to DIRECT those desires & feelings & needs in the most productive, positive, learning, helpful, growing way - avoiding big contentious, crying moments is always my goal! ; )  Good luck|`|jR0VTOYFaa	Tell her there is a monster in your bed and she would be much safer in her own room where the care bears sleep
AA10196172	Generally, if the test says positive then you are.    Sometimes the test will read negative when you are, but it's not usually wrong the other way.    Discharge could mean anything. Some women have what's called"decidual bleeding", what looks like periods, for a month or several after conception. They think it's periods and don't know they are pregnant.    If the bleeding is strange and doesn't stop you should always see a doctor. It could be anything pregnant related or not.|`|bVRgrvDbaa	Many women still get their period when they're pregnant. If you took a pregnancy test and it said positive, then most likely you are! If you are concered about misscarriage, You really need to consult your md. Either way you need to consult your md. B/c if you are pregnant, he needs to check up on baby!!|`|9EkFrApiaa	Umm...you should be seeing a doctor now I think.

I had a very light period it was brownish, then got a little pinker.  I would have in on and off for a couple days....   Or I mean it was actually 2 weeks    I am 14 weeks today. This is actually very normal and it happens many many times to pregnant woman. You have nothing to worry about CONGRATS!    Go to the doctor, she will reassure it. And start taking prenatal pills its very important for a healthy baby.|`|Bf8PVFSSaa	your pregnant.    Eat Funyuns.|`|uIlmjJjhaa	go to the hospital.

Try another test and if it says the same thing, then there's a pretty much 100% chance that you are.    I think you should go and see the doctor about the blood though as it's not normal.|`|tljc8Axkaa	there is a chance you miscarried lots of women have miscarriages without even knowing they were pregnant, i found out i was pregnant at a very early stage then my period come like i was a few days late the little pink line got fainter and fainter until it disapeared and was now showing negative so maybe doing another pregnacy test would help. good luck i hope all is ok|`|zWB3jHHPaa	haha your tummy's baking a baby|`|1EwbKkKCaa	to me it sounds like a miscarriage.

Some people have a period and still be pregnant. The best way to know is to contact your doctor and see them right away.|`|kJeRAg5Kaa	the brown discharge is often sign of an infection.dont consider as to be normal.go to a doctor for that.take the test again.if +ve take a test at a lab to confirm|`|h6AH6Biyaa	Some people have bleeding even when they are pregnant.  It could be from the process of implantation of a fertilized egg, or it could be a hormonal thing.  Or, as you say, it could be a failed early pregnancy.    You could take another pregnancy test.  If it still comes out positive, it will be time to consult an OB/GYN to find out what's been happening.|`|wscyjkPAaa	Go to the doctor and get checked.  Pills do have pregnancy hormones in them that make your eggs reject sperm, so this may cause you to have a positive on your home pregnancy test.  You also may be spotting, due to forgetting to take your pills or due to  a fertilized egg implanting itself in your uterus.  So go get checked but it sounds like you may be pregnant.|`|VArUXbeoaa	you could be pregnant, you took a test and it said positive, every test isn't right, so try another test and make sure you get a pretty accurate one, If you started to have a discharge then that may just mean that you've contracted a disease and/or are discharging.  Take another test and if it says the same thing that the first one said then it is time to go talk to your doctor about it.   I don't think that you miscarried because if you were to miscarry the color of the blood would be red and the discharge would be thick.|`|NLj70oJIaa	Your pregnant & your miscarrying
FgAPXhVRaa	Honestly I felt her first move at about 11 weeks when I was lying on my side. I had just had something sweet and all of a sudden I felt these flutters for about 45 mins. It was the most amazing feeling. Then at about 17 weeks or so, I felt the movements become more defined. Now at 22 weeks, as I sit her she is going crazy moving all over the place!!! :) I will be ecstatic when she is born but I will miss feeling her move in my tummy!!! I love it!|`|o7E59VYZaa	i felt my little sweetpea start to move at 20 weeks:) but then again like all the answers on here so far everyone is different.|`|T48smu01aa	I first felt flutters at 14 weeks when everyone said no its gas it wasn't and then i saw a poke through at 18 weeks it was little but i saw it and now at 25 weeks man does this baby seem like it wants out haha!  good luck and congrats if your pregnant!|`|DNygQdmVaa	I felt my baby move at 19 weeks.|`|y54GgdOXaa	I felt him move around 20 weeks. I didn't know it was him moving until I went to the ultrasound and saw him moving and felt it as he did it.|`|bVRgrvDbaa	I felt mine at 15 weeks.|`|vZwJyqc6aa	I felt the first movements around 15 weeks. It's very faint but it's distinctive.|`|KWPnoqGMaa	u start feeling movement around your 6 month|`|JMDQr0tqaa	Usually around 16 or 17 weeks. I've felt a little already and I'm only 14 weeks, but it can happen when it's your second baby.|`|Z4IwPsrHaa	I felt that "tingling feeling" like around 15 weeks. This week I've actually felt the baby move or kick(which is soooo amazing). I'm 20 weeks with my first baby. Good luck hun!|`|AA11220327	this all depends on how many pregnancies you have had. most 1st pregnancies the mom can start to feel it between 15-18 weeks, but the more kids you have, the quicker you can feel it, because you know what to expect and what you are feeling. I am 16 weeks pregnant with  3, and I have felt movement for a good few weeks now.|`|fa447c4475a222c409f5813c593490c3aa	I was almost 19 weeks ( now 30) it was really faint, it gets stronger the further you are|`|0de60a89e9f7e2a8a9c90ff78512aa34aa	You probably won't feel your baby kick until sometime between 16 and 22 weeks, even though he started moving at 7 or 8 weeks and you may have already witnessed his acrobatics if you've had an ultrasound.
RT3Og4Oiaa	According to my E.D.D. thingy in my Pregnancy book you should be due around June 8-9 . so you are roughly 5 months give or take..I am due May 10th. And I am 6 months...(26 weeks-5days) But if you are that far along, you should know this by going to Dr's Appts regularly.|`|33h5R8nTaa	Last year i got pregnant around Sept. 17thish and i had my daughter June 21st..So your probable due around the bigging of june. and you are most likely 6 months or so along....You should go to the doc and find out for shore and if you are that far along you should know how far along you are because you should be going to the doc once a month.|`|NwTggQ2Baa	not exactly sure. when did you take your pregnancy test that said you were pregnant? Talk to your doctor. He/She should know|`|wKYdIaZVaa	You can't really go by that. My date was totally off when they did the calculation of my due date based on the first day of my last period.

MCTyWCu2aa	No shes over 18 she is responsible for everything. They wont come after you.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	They may take into account her free rent.  Which is fine by me, families should support eachother.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	They only worry about overpaying food stamps, or cash assistance. That's when they want reimbersed. They generally don't go after anyone for Medicaid.|`|DNygQdmVaa	They can try, but they most likely wont.  unless shes not with the babys father, theyll try to go after him|`|YQ8YsYepaa	No, she is over 18 she is responsible and the father. She will have signed something assigning them child support payments to cover costs if he is absent and they choose to go after him. It varies from state to state, but they do not go after the grandparents.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	It maybe different state to state but I live in Indiana and had medicaid while pregnant and have never gotten a bill and my daughter is 10 months old. No mother I know that has been on medicaid during her pregnancy has ever been asked to pay. However I have a friend who was billed $500.00 for the birth of HIS son. They went after the father, which I think is only fair. He's in this too. And really it was only $500.00 considering if it was all out of pocket it would have been in the thousands! Good Luck.|`|eya1WDS4aa	No they cant. she is legally an adult so the parents have no responiblity for her medical bills.|`|6cwJi5kxaa	It doesnt matter what age your daughter is. Medicaid will not try and go after her unless they feel that something is suspicious. They have a law (depending on where you live) that they will not let any mothers go without insurace while they are pregnant. So even if she lives at home with you she will still be accepted. The only difference is that instead of them paying the whole thing she may receive share cost. Share cost is like having a deductible every month. But no they will not go after her.|`|mgLb5Yohaa	Actually...they can. She is residing in your household, and Medicaid takes into consideration the household income, including mom's and dad's. Yes, she's of age, but they rely on the income info for this very reason. That is why so many people use other addresses with lower income families (I've discovered from cousins of mine). They can get this money back from household members either through garnishments, or, a favorite, tax time! They will of course send you a letter beforehand, informing you of their just cause.    My sister received food stamps for a period of time while getting herself together and living with an aunt. The aunt made a comfortable income, and 3 years later, the Federal govt came after her for food stamp monies reimbursement for the years they paid for my sister...it was about $500.     I would research this personally by calling down to Social Services, or the Medicaid department. These govt programs can be a headache to deal with at times...|`|9l3qnrUxaa	dont lie and you have nothing to worry about. Meaning, when you fill out the paperwork be as honest as possible, if they find out for instance (you say you only have one income) and they find that there is 2 they can come back on you and make you pay. My advice would be to be honest and if push comes to shove they will only make you pay a small amount like $15 a visit.|`|c60d629a9c752c61dbe6a0c1f82dda78aa	You should have raised your daughter to be more sexually responsible so that people who actually work and pay taxes won't have to pay for her illegitimate child's care.
GGH0HVdvaa	Wow, that dress is amazing!!    I love dresses with corset bodices, they're so shaping and beautiful. Just try going to any nice dress stores, they have them in malls and such, and look for a dress there.    Or even at bridal shops, browse through bridesmaid's dresses, they are just as fancy usually as what one would wear to prom. And you can usually find dresses that are laced up the back like a corset. Good luck honey!!|`|4KHDjq62aa	OMG I was just like you last year. Go to henris.com. They have beautiful dresses thats where i got mine. you'll love them. I took a trip out there to buy mines.

You have to be pretty tall / skinny to pull it off, it won't look the same on an average girl! Look for something that'd suit your body shape, not just one that you like the look of (if that dress would suit your figure, go for it xD)
AA10730513	My daughter has very expensive taste and when she has it - my mom gives in to her wants more than I do.     Last year when we were doing our back to school shopping, she talked me into picking up a very nice $40 outfit for church. It was on the clearance rack - I think the retail price was just over $100 and I could see where the store had marked out and lowered the price to $80, $60, then $40. While I think that was an insane amount to spend on a 6 year old, I have to admit that I have no regrets. It looks so perfect on her!     My mom spent $40 something on a black skirt when she was 4 and 30 something on a pair of tennis shoes when she was 2 or 3. But in general, I try to stick to the cheaper stuff at Walmart. (Gotta love the clearance rack! She has gotten several cute t-shirts for $2 each.)|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I spent $25 on a winter coat, but other than that, a $20 puffy vest from the Children's Place. It was just so cute!|`|omq3X7wgaa	$120 - shoes, but had a coupon for 20% off at footlocker|`|cteyFJxhaa	I spent $150 for a winter coat once but we live in Canada and he wore it pretty much everyday from mid-October until late March so that's not bad for that much wear.  I think I spent $130 for his grade 8 grad suit and $80-$100 is pretty standard for shoes.      I have to assume that a lot of you posting have little kids.  These purchases are from when he was in his teens.  Wait until you guys see how hard a teenage boy can be on cloths.

I won't ever do it again tho, he has torn it up completely....he cut holes in the sleeve right above the cuff so he could put his thumb through it....I guess that's the style now?

FgAPXhVRaa	I am 22 weeks and the same size as you... I have not gained a pound my entire pregnancy because my eating habits have changed... I have actually lost about 25lbs since finding out I was pregnant. My doctor said that it was perfectly fine!!! He said that I am healthier. He tests me occasionally for gestational diabetes and every time my glucose levels are at the lower end of the scale and my blood pressure has stayed in between 118/68 - 127/78. He said I am doing wonderfully. I was really worried too, but things that have helped me is maintaining a low sodium diet and really I just watch my sodium, I am not too anal about it, but I figure it will help keep it under control. Like I said my eating habits have changed and my water intake has increased... I drink about 2-3 gallons of water a day. I know that sounds crazy but because I am bigger I REALLY don't want to swell, because that will make it harder on my heart! Anyway, that is what I do... I hope that helps. I am very happy and maybe you will be able to maintain your weight or loose weight like I have!!! Good luck!!! :)|`|g5RS83paaa	I was a size 14 with mine, I gained about 30 lbs, but only lost about 8lbs with each birth, so just watch how much you gain, it's so hard to lose it.

So far everything looks great and the doctor hasn't mentioned a thing about my weight.  The only big difference is how much weight to gain during pregnancy.  If you are over weight then it's best for you to not gain as much.  Ask your doctor about that..    One thing to remember is not to TRY to lose weight while you are pregnant.  What I did was to start eating healthy for the baby's sake.  You will actually lose a little weight during your first trimester, as do alot of pregnant women.    Just relax and don't let the things you read online or in books worry you.  Good luck and congrats to you!|`|R0RnjdnXaa	My friend was overweight with her pregnancy but she tried to eat healthy and didn't gain much only like 15 pounds and had a healthy 7 pound baby.

Therefore, I've been taking walks every single day since I got pregnant.  I'm now 23 weeks and have gained only 2 pounds since getting pregnant.  This is good because the baby is still the size it should be, but my weight is in check.  Doctors recommend gaining no more than 15 pounds if you're overweight.  Also, eat very healthy and drink lots of water.  Try not to eat junk food, it's just not good for you or baby.  Good luck.|`|KK3skQc2aa	I lost 40 pounds before I got pregnant, felt great about myself and still was a size 16. I was concerned about this as well and more worried that my dr would be very critical of me because of it. Ive always heard "If your overweight you can only gain 10-15 pounds while your prenant!" How the h*** can a pregnant person only gain 10 lbs?!!!    You can still watch what you eat but dont diet, just make healthier food choices. I am delivering next week and I have gained 34 pounds. Dont believe the "because your overweight you will have high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, low iron, etc" crap. I have excellent BP 124/72 thank you very much no chance of gest diab and high iron! You can have a healthy kid if you just watch it. Not that hard|`|zXIDR1INaa	I was overweight and had my first 4 babies while being overweight.  I delivered 4 very healthy children.  I ate healthy and stayed active i actually lost weight with most of them while i was pregnant.  I wasnt trying to it was probably from working alot and eating healthy.  I never had any problems with high blood pressure or anything else either.  I'm sure you'll be fine and good luck :)|`|tljc8Axkaa	well put it this way with my first i was a size 10 ended up at a size 18 after birth i have stayed the same since my first son was very healty and is now 8 and a very bright kid i carried on to have another 2 children staying at a size 18 they are healty little things and i am now pregnant withmy 4th and everything if perfectly normal im due in 2 weks and have had no problems|`|7IHMjy2caa	I was overweight before I go pregnant with my daughter.     As someone said I was told to try to gain no more than 15 pounds. I still gained 20, but within a week after she was born I was down to only 5 pounds heavier than pre-baby.    They did watch me closely for high blood pressure and gestational diabetes. I was induced at 10 days overdue because my blood pressure was getting too high.     Be careful with what you eat and the amounts you eat, no eating a whole cake under the guise of eating for two ;) but it is completely possible to have a wonderful healthy baby even being over weight.     I was also heavier than you are based on clothing sizes.|`|6yy0jtzDaa	I weighed 237 when i got pregnant lost 15 lbs with her the first 3 months and have only gained about 6 of it back and i am 25 weeks all women are different and when you watch your food choices meaning making healthier choices you will be fine being over weight can be bad in some cases but so can being underwieight so just be healthy for you are your baby and will be fine!  if you waste all your time being worried you will regret it|`|ixD2RnqTaa	Hi Im 24 weeks pregnant and I have already gained 28 lbs. And I am overweight. I developed a blood clot and high blood pressure around 12 weeks.    So about a month ago I stopped eating junk and drinking pop and starting drinking more water and eating more healthy.  I have only gained 2 lbs since then.  So my advice is eat right, excersise and drink water. You should be fine!|`|4cehW3S9aa	Nope not overweight.    I am 5"11" and weighed roughly 132 when I got pregnant.      I am 12 weeks and have gained 6 pounds!
9X09kM4oaa	My answer may not be that popular, but he is just going through a phase and you just got to be there when he needs you. He needs his mommy. He should grow out of it eventually.|`|X6as2nOAaa	OMG! I have a similar problem my baby is 6 months old and is waking up every two hours or less to have a bottle or something she is not teething and she isn't poopy and I don't know what to do, I ask the question today and I'm going a little bit crazy not knowing what to do. I'm so tired!|`|t9S0dqfLaa	Oh the joys of motherhood :)  Personally I think he's going through a stage ( my son sure is ) I was excited last night that my son actually slept in his crib, my husband and I got a chance to " cuddle "|`|SZSD3aFRaa	I have a 9 month old son and when he was between 7-8 months old he started doing the same thing. He had been sleeping between 8-10 hours straight every night for months and then it stopped cold turkey. He would wake up and not even want to eat, just be held and rocked. It didn't seem to matter what we did to try and correct the situation. I even got to the point where he was sleeping in bed with us just so that I could sleep. This went on for almost 2 months and just within the last few weeks he started sleeping for longer and longer stretches and just last night he slept from 9-6!! I read something about how at that age they start going through separation anxiety and just need to be close. When I decided that I wanted him back in his crib I would setup his crib with a pillow at the head and two on either side so that when I layed him down he felt like he was still being held and snuggled by me. I used one of my pillows so that it smells like me. As long as your baby is strong enought that if he woke up or rolled over he wouldn't have any issue with getting stuck in the pillows. Mine just stands up and doesn't get caught up. Just keep doing your regular routine and eventually he will get back to sleeping well at night. Also, at 8 months they only need about 10-12 hours of sleep per 24 hours. Which means that if he is sleeping well at night he probably won't be taking as many or as long of daytime naps. Mine just tends to take 2 or 3 half hour catnaps throughout the day usually after feedings. It may seem like heck right now but it will get better!|`|PvGMkNVoaa	Do you still swaddle him? He may just want to feel warm and secure and that's what he gets in your arms. I get my one-month-old to stay asleep when I put him down by wrapping him with a thick blanket as soon as he's fed, rocking him to sleep, and then gently and slowly putting him down and patting his back a little if he stirs. I use a thick blanket because it's not so easy for him to feel that his environment has changed. Oh, and I turn on a fan so he won't get too hot.|`|VueZ5u9Waa	That exact thing happened to me but around 9 months. I had to resort to the "cry it out" method, which I was previously against, but I had to do it, and it really worked. After 2 nights he was sleeping through the night again. It is hard to hear them cry, but if they've had their bottle, diaper changed, etc. then he just is wanting to be held, which you can't do every hour! Best of luck, he'll be ok! I promise!
ZVqEDvZSaa	why didnt you just ask if its a boy or a girl?|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Hehe My son's has for the FIRST time today been below 140. You can't go by heart rates.|`|c159efe1b44ee4b1b369d779c1d19521aa	I bet it is a boy! I think boys supposedly have higher heart rates than girls, but I know my little guy's heart rate was around 170ish. Wait until your ultrasound to start buying anything though! Oh how I remember those baby shopping urges!! :-)|`|rqOIqO7Raa	Did they say it was a girl? Look for the "3 lines" in the ultrasound, if you are basing it off of just the heart rate there is a VERY good chance it is a boy!    Congrats to you!|`|0iUxfCMcaa	in earlier pregnancy my daughters heartrate was between 160-170 but once i entered the second trimester she went down to 130-140 and shes staying that way.|`|yPNvecc7aa	Defining gender by the heartrate is just an old wive's tale.  My baby's heartrate has always been high and he's a boy.    So to answer your question, yes there is a chance you are having a boy.|`|WPI0Z47saa	That wives tale doesn't mean anything. Both my boys were over 165.|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	heartrate has nothing to do with it  old wives tales  I had a high heart rate SON|`|rUPjr7hjaa	If you're only going by the heartbeat, yes, it's still possible that it's a boy.|`|e8HCEZDpaa	You can't base anything on heartrates. That is completely an old wives tale. Wait until you have your anatomy ultrasound before you go out buying anything.|`|8hwGmfs8aa	just because the heart rate is high doesn mean its a girl.....unless the midwife says to you boy or girl thn you dnt kno......|`|WdRLgvw6aa	Until you see your 2nd trimester ultrasound, there's no way to know if it's a boy or a girl for sure.  All that stuff about bpm is just an old wive's tale.|`|6yy0jtzDaa	don't buy anything until you know for sure or its neutral the heartrate meaning nothing|`|jar8EIelaa	I'm so glad I had my kids back in the days before ultrasounds were done on every baby and we got to have a true surprise at the end of all that labor.  I had a little bit of pink, a little bit of blue.  It really was fun going the entire pregnancy dreaming of life with a daughter, or life with a son.  Don't be in such a hurry to know.  Enjoy your time of just being pregnant. : )  You have such a short time to dream as it is... and the rest of your life to know what you have.|`|GTC1yKAPaa	of course there is a chance its a boy! Don't buy anything yet, you sill have about a month before you will be able to know the sex of the baby!|`|otFCWMuUaa	its not guaranteed.. the heart rate thing is just an old wives tale wait for an ultrasound|`|ca9dEvSAaa	DON'T go by the heartbeat! Yes there is a 50% chance it's a boy if you have not seen the genitals.  My little girls HR has been everywhere from 135 BPM to 180 BPM. Mostly 137 to 142 BPM. Don't buy pink until your ultrasound.
9X09kM4oaa	Just from my daughters personal experience- she was 2 and a half months old and was diagnosed with a upper respiratory infection because her doctor was to lazy to do any other testing... it turned out she had rsv and is 3 months old and just got out of the hospital for it. She was sneezy, congested and coughed. Please take your little one to get tested for rsv just in case, its very serious, taylor almost died because she couldn't breathe well and her oxygen level dropped to 80 :(|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Oh, God, my son has his first cold too.  We took him to the ER last night because he was wheezing and having trouble breathing.    It could be that her immune system is stronger than his.  My son and I have the same cold, and he has it worse than I do. And my immune system is just a little bit stronger than his.  Or it's because of the incubation period.  Did her cousin's cold start out as just a little cough and some congestion? If so, then it might be about to get a lot worse.  Also, if she's breastfed, she might have an easier time with it.  Or maybe her cousin has asthma or something.    There's a lot of different reasons, just watch her in the days to come to make sure she stays okay.|`|w4zjmhxoaa	My son had what you're describing, last year at about 6 months.  It was RSV and he caught it 1 week after being exposed.  It's so super contagious!  And takes a while to get rid of.  It comes with a fever and terrible congestion in the nose and lungs.  The throwing up when he coughs is actually a good thing I think -- babies aren't very good at doing a "productive cough" to get the mucus up, so throwing up is a way to get rid of all that yuck.  Our son would start caughing and we'd hold him the other way!    Maybe she won't get it as bad, or maybe she's getting another kind of cold, who knows!  Keep an eye on her temp and give her tylenol if she develops any sort of fever.  Give her steam showers to break up the mucus.  Use your aspirator to suck her nose out, and give saline drops to help with congestion.  Keep a humidifier in her room when she sleeps, and try to prop her up on an angle.  Use Vick's vapor rub on her chest before bed, and then put some on her feet with socks! seriously!  There really isn't much else you can do for a wee one!  It will take a while for the congestion to clear because babies also can't really blow their noses either -- so it just slowly leaks out.    I hope your babe feels better soon!|`|2cstdEkIaa	get Baby Noses Saline drops, cool mist humdifier, chamomile bubble bath, aspirator..and just be prepared..my son had th flu in December, he had diarrhea and we had to put him on a banana, cerreal, apple sauce diet for about 3-4 days to clear it up..poor thing couldnt even have formula..then he lost the ability to digest it and was switched to soy milk..he got through it though and he will be 1 this Saturday! Im sure you will get through it too, just be prepared and keep everything i listed on hand plus a thermometer. Baby Vicks vapor rub too|`|NLxCpn8iaa	It can take a week or more to get sick after exposure.  It is possible that your little girl has a lesser degree of the illness or that she's just in the beginning stages.  It sounds like the cousin may have croup!  Watch her closely, put a cool mist humidifier in your baby's room and use a little saline nasal drip in her nose and then suck it with your little bulb thingy... And of course, if you are worried, it won't hurt to see a doctor just in case!    Good luck, I hope she doesn't get it too bad!|`|PZLwu9QAaa	Babies respond differently to infections than older children and adults.  Just wait it out and see if it gets to be too harsh.  Most likely she'll be fine.  Both my daughters had very bad colds as infants, and the only thing the doctor would allow me to do is saline in the nose along with an aspirator, and sit in a steamy bathroom and pat their backs.  There is no decongestant for infants.|`|TzLe0GEEaa	Your daughter may not have contracted the same respiratory infection as her cousin, but may have picked up a cold virus elsewhere.  It's also possible that her immune system is doing really well fighting off the infection.  Since her symptoms are relatively mild, she seems to be okay for the time being, but keep a close eye on her breathing patterns, as well as her temperature.  If she spikes a fever or is having trouble clearing her airway, you will want to take her to the doctor.
rqOIqO7Raa	Just wait, why risk it? You would pry be fine, but in the event you weren't how would that make you feel, knowing you made you and your baby sick over a pierced lip. You may also change your mind after your baby is born. Little hands have a tendency to grab things and not let go! OUCH!|`|jWBZMmGAaa	yes you can pierce any thing while pergnat  even your clit    i my self wouldnt recommend it cause it could get infected then you would have a problem cause you would need to treaty the infection and it might not be a safe idea (BUT HEY THIS IS JUST WHAT I THINK SO DONT MIND ME)   ALSO IF THE PLACE PIERCEING KNOWS YOUR PREGNAT THEY WILL NOT PIERCE YOU    OR ATLEAST THAT IS WHAT THEY DO IN MISSOURI YOUR STATE MIGHT BE DIFFERENT|`|vKEYa8aeaa	its not safe to get a tattoo or piercing while pregnant because of the risk of infection. especially in or around the mouth. just wait until babe is born =]    good luck and congrats|`|3XFZHhWgaa	I think its fine...Its not chemicals or anything...Its maybe a little rubbing alcohol which is okay and a piercing which is a needle in your lip. GO for it.|`|WPI0Z47saa	That is fine. It doesn't affect the baby because there is no anesthesia. The only thing that could hurt the baby is if you get an infection. Be careful.|`|MtC3CWZraa	You don't want to do anything that puts you at risk of getting an infection. Don't do it.|`|7bTOY5vHaa	They will not pierce anything if you are pregnant. There is a reason why they dont it.|`|9l3qnrUxaa	I dont think its a good idea|`|Xnr5Y7Coaa	I don't think the piercing itself will harm the baby but when I pierced my eyebrow a long time ago the guy had me go to the pharmacy to buy some pills for the pain and some antibiotics to keep infections off. I think this is the part that will harm the baby so I would say no to the piercing for now. Just my opinion though.|`|a732cc20369212fe385773a398cdf5b8aa	wait until after there is always risk of infection. id say dont do it but if u want a professional opinion call you doctor...|`|OU9xnW86aa	Ask your doctor and ask the piercing place. If your doctor says its ok and the piercer will do it then go ahead.|`|UjKmgZVeaa	It's ok to do whatever you want.  It is your body, and your baby.    Follow the piercer's instructions to avoid infection, but even if an infection did occur it could be treated.  Far more dramatic things have pregnant women endured over millenia of bearing children.    Do what you feel!|`|B6Mfx5fUaa	I wouldn't want to risk infection.  Just hold off and treat yourself after the baby is born! =)|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	just make sure everything is brand new and clean.|`|GpR5MI5raa	from what i've read, it could be ok, but its not recemended because of the risk of infection. i would wait until the babies born.|`|zXIDR1INaa	Infection would be your only concern.  When i have had piercings they want you to soak them in a warm salt water mix to help the healing.  So as long as you dont get any infection i would think it would be just fine.
RPszYGXkaa	I also love Gain!!  It is a tad cheaper than tide, but still cleans the clothes really well.  I think it almost has a cedar-like smell to it...I could smell my clothes forever!!  I still buy Tide sometimes too...|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Whichever one is the least expensive at the store on the day my husband goes shopping.   Usually it's a generic/store brand.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I love Tide, but my husband hates the price. He'll try to use Purex or something called Sun (I think) that's sold at Walmart.|`|a3MSSvdcaa	I like the Gain Apple Mango Tango!!  Soooo good! And when I run the dryer, you can smell it outside even!! Love it!  I also am a fan of Tide original scent, but the Gain smells better!|`|lkhCeAdJaa	I have always been a die hard Tide fan..................Surf runs a close second.    Mountain Spring scent is the best.  I use Downy liquid fabric softener with the green lid........also Mountain Spring scent.|`|BypjotRpaa	Gain, apple mango tango is my absolute favorite!|`|q9BItD25aa	Tide for whites  All for colors|`|RF52FRdyaa	im not a parent, but I do laundry- mines is gain. my mother has been using it for as long as i can remember|`|5WYeHh0paa	I totally hear you on line drying! I try to only really dry maybe one load of laundry per week. I loooove the smell of Tide with baking soda.  I dont know what it is ...its just so fresh!|`|4CMQuJgOaa	we use Tide Free or All Clear-our daughter has eczema|`|2cstdEkIaa	Tide is all I buy.|`|upk9TNWsaa	My hubby loves tide, or either gain but mainly tide. If i go cheap and buy purex he doesnt like it too much. I have lined dried in the past though and I love to do it and saving electricity but I guess it gets too hot around here and they get so hard??? Even with softener I dont know maybe I dont add enough softener.|`|AA12145826	Whatever one is on sale is my new favorite. Usually we buy the generic store brand or Gain. I prefer the "Mountain Fresh" or "Spring Blossom" type scents, while my husband likes the "Lavender" scents.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I think the kind I buy is Extra. It's super cheap and gets the job done|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	I have to use dreft because my son has eczema.|`|8bd0cec87a0d755d21781eb963fff790aa	I love the smell of Gain, but we buy Costco brand in bulk for the price.|`|dtHjJah5aa	Gain
w4zjmhxoaa	Well, my son knew what it meant then, but he didn't care.  He cared only when he knew he would get his hand smacked, or what he was playing with would be taken away.  The word "no" has to carry some weight for them to care.  And even now at 19 months, sometimes he feels that what he is doing is worth the punishment and doesn't care about the word no =)|`|paerqxfMaa	When he has kids of his own - they really never learn the meaning of no.|`|YQ8YsYepaa	When they have children of their own :P. He is only 9 mos old. Just keep using positive reinforcement for the word "yes" and remove him from the situation that "no " applies to.|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	They understand the tone of your voice for sure, I still have to remove cords and stuff and my son is 1 it goes on for ever Im sure. I have always got down to eye level and explained to them why not, as stupid as that may sound he seems to understand that it will cause 'owies'!|`|AA10518946	am he  sure he understand he might just be ingoring u that when the little tap come in|`|qFmOuXMXaa	I have a 10 year old and she still doesn't understand that word.lol   I think what you should try is that every time you say NO move him from what he is touching....it may suck but it really doesn't get easier with time, just different.    Good luck|`|aSKsDtwLaa	Drop the name.     Just say "no" sharply.  If he does not mind remove him.  Do so 100 times if you must.  Don't get angry, but your voice needs to be firm enough to let him know you mean it.  If you say no once and don't another time he will not believe you are serious.|`|4uqj8Nf1aa	try say no followed by a action,for example "no" and move him away.  kindo like litter trianing kittens!|`|AA10371609	You just have to keep after him.  He'll begin to understand.  Be consistent and persistent.  Its hard to keep them safe sometimes, but I'm sure you're doing great!|`|VueZ5u9Waa	I think they start understanding "no" around 10 months, but it certainly doesn't mean they're going to obey it. My son is 11 months and he knows what "no" means, but doesn't listen- he's a baby who's just learning. It will take awhile!|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	Olivia knew at about that age. and would pout out her bottom lip, then try again. its not that he doesnt necessarily understand, its that he doesnt care.     my daughter is almsot 14 months and I say no about 2000 times a day!!|`|4MjSgjAAaa	never my son is 5 years old and still doesn't understand Lil  my second son is 8 months old and into everything and when i say no sternly he just laughs at me and then i just have to give in

AjqO1aJgaa	Yup, instant nerd. If only the parents of all the delinquents in the world knew about it, most teen problems would be solved instantly.    No, having a poster does not make you a nerd. But choosing what you put on your wall based on what others will think of it, rather than what you want, makes you a sheep.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	No, of course not. I think that's a cool poster.|`|Jucak0HLaa	No,that one is funny.|`|2259822f0cd7ff32d9ffac0f2a824a63aa	Albert was more than a brainiac:  He played the violin with passion (whoa!).  He hung out with the artistic types (writers), not the mathematicians and scientists.  He had a sense of humor!  Remember the poster of him sticking his tongue out?!  He was lighthearted and cheerful.  Remember the poster of him riding a bicycle with a gleeful expression?!|`|pcjOQDymaa	no!  einstein is the bomb:)    lol seriously he is amazing.|`|jbjoO4V7aa	Umm idk. Maybe if you decorated it all cool you could get a funky-ish vibe instead of a nerdy one.|`|HQyVeaPPaa	um no...  i dont think anyone would care.  put it up if you want|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	LOL. That's a cool poster. And no way, it wouldn't make you a nerd.|`|V3UTk863aa	wtf|`|a7914a6e514ecfb4c483051bab181458aa	my math teacher has the same one.    Enough said.|`|9opxj3Ydaa	Of course not, put whatever you want on your wall, why do you care so much what anyone thinks of you?|`|dgRTkccBaa	I think caring what other people think about you makes you more of a nerd than the poster does.  If you like it, put it up regardless of what other people might think.  What makes their opinion more valid than your own?  BTW, from what i've heard Einstein was quite the lady's man.|`|sSrwcZb9aa	If you want to put a poster of Einstein on your wall, you're already a nerd, and putting that (or anything else) on your wall won't change it... so go for it, and embrace your inner nerdiness! I know it sounds 'uncool', but for what other group of people is it socially acceptable to play with Legos or dress up as your favorite movie character or have a nerf gun war as an adult?

Therefore just go on with your life and ignore that.

When the principal came out, she got in trouble and I didn't because I was just blocking her, not hitting her.

At this age, and until they're about a year old, babies are getting most of their nutrition from milk - breast or formula, whichever you're using. Therefore, there's no panic about getting her onto a balanced diet immediately.    Some babies (mine, for example) react to solids in their diet and can be quite uncomfortable for the first month or two. If your baby seems uncomfortable, maybe try blander foods -- baby rice, for example, mixed with milk.|`|ce6172d59fe7a0f01a586ed3e1737d4aaa	Who or what is an "LO"?
WlU3NFu6aa	you can try it. try give him some Gerber puffs. they melt easily. We started with that. and Cheerios. DD is 13 mo and she LOVES Cheerios. She just went through a phase where she refused everything but that haha. Pasta I found can be a bit chewy so its harder to chew and slimy so hard to pick up.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	It can be very anxious.  I know exactly what you mean.  Yet I didn't want my own nervous-nelly side to prevent my son from moving on to a stage he was ready for.    I started with the damn Gerber puffs.  Yes, they are crap, but you can taste a few and see how easily they melt in your mouth and then give them to him to prove to yourself that he can chew.  Then throw them away!    The more you do it, the more you will gain confidence in him and in your own judgment.  It is a learning experience for you too.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Nature is smart.  Nature has thoughtfully arranged things so that when a baby is able to pick up foods and put them in his mouth, he's ALSO able to gum them up and swallow them. (Remember, nature doesn't know about rice cereal or little jars of Gerber. Nature expects that babies will be breastfed until they are able to self-feed simple foods.)    So, try offering him some foods.  If he can pick them up, he can eat them. If he's not quite there, he may gag a bit, but he won't choke. (Gagging is a reflex that protects him from choking.)      Cheerios are 'dry', but they soften up and crumble very quickly in his mouth.  Try one yourself. Your saliva will soften it up in a few seconds.    But yeah, you could try toast or peas (no need to smoosh them) or shredded cheese.  If you can mash it between your fingers, HE can gum it up. Anything soft and small is fine.|`|SDjrojZXaa	My son is great at feeding himself but I am always SOO parinoid...I make his bannanas Real small and I do smoosh the peas because i worry they can roll down his throught and choke lol. but I started out with puffs and teething cookies the key is to just watch him...i only feed him in his high chair because i dont want him crawling around....I got him the gerber graduate mac and cheese and i have to admit those noodles mush pretty good.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Place your son in his high chair.  Put some saltines (the plain white crackers available in stores) onto the 'table' and let your child fend for himself.  Yes, he'll get 'wet cracker' all over the place, from his head to anywhere within 8 feet of that high-chair.  Yes, he'll look terrible and you'll need to give him a bath.  You'll live.  Tomorrow give him more 'finger foods' ... try the toast (with some butter on it ... plain toast isn't 'tasty') for breakfast and the Cheerios for lunch.  At his age, he should be sitting quietly waiting for you to set his bowl and spoon on his table so he can 'eat by himself' but you are making him 'slow' because you are so 'afraid' he's going to choke or get dirty.  He's a baby and he NEEDS TIME.  Yes, he'll get most of any finger food 'on' or 'around' him ... but he'll also get some 'inside him' ... and he'll be better and smarter for it!  I know he's a baby.  My son had crackers from the time he was 4-1/2 months old and was eating big bowls of cooked green beans at 7-1/2 months ... with his fingers.  He uses a fork when he eats them now ... but then hes in his 30s and had two daughters of his own (they're 11 and 9 years old) and they also love to eat 'real food.'|`|X6as2nOAaa	I have a 6 month old and I give her the toast things from walmart and the dis solvable things that have flavor and she loves those.|`|NroZQN5vaa	Try rice rusks. You can pick them up at wal mart or any baby store and they are great. They melt in baby's mouth so they won't choke and you can break them into small enough pieces that you won't have to worry so much. Otherwise, Cheerios are great. Just give him one at a time and keep a close eye on him. That's usually one of the first finger foods. Good luck!|`|DgmDfwxDaa	Start your son out on Gerber biting biscuits or toast sticks. You find them next to the baby food. They are both great to start them out on as far as snacking on. Neither one of them fall apart and they are not small. He will also learn to hold his food. Don' t worry, you are not the only mother that has been scared to give their baby more solid foods. I was that way too. I would just suggest that you watch your son to make sure he is not having trouble eating these foods. Remember SLOWLY introduce new foods, so he doesn't develop allergies. Once your son does good on these two foods and learns how to chew then he can progress into different foods.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	try Gerber puffs...if he is not ready they dissolve on the tongue. We started with bananas and my daughter did great. I just started making things thicker and thicker until she was eating solids. We did not do cheerios for a while (11mo) because they seemed too hard (I was nuts I know :)|`|j7Mxfr1yaa	does he make a chewing type of movement when you feed him?    try some of the snacks in the baby food isle like rice snacks or biter biscuits     you could always give him jerky to chew on to learn because they cant bite through jerkey try things like grapes cut into quarters they are easier to pick up than banannas or even a soft peice of bread...     my son was eating a ton of things off of my plate when he was that age and you could probbably give him anything that doesn't fall apart when he picks it up....|`|jTM6Upm5aa	I gave my son cheerios, I broke them in half. They were his favourite
nzgZR6onaa	Listen we all make mistakes and some of us don't realize it till our kids are older and we sit back and rehash the past. WOW I'm speaking from experience.I hated pacifiers but my second child always cried and the darn thing seemed to work.She was the only one out of all five that had one,And I breastfed everyone too. So go figure. She didn't talk for a while and I realize of course she was to busy sucking to talk Of course now you can't keep the kid quiet.LOL! But we all make mistakes and I don't see where you're making all these horrible mistakes. Frozen veggies can be better than fresh. They are frozen right away and hold in vitamins. Unless we can get just picked right out of the garden veggies then with transporting time and such veggies can be almost ready to spoil by the time we get them.My sister was a tv fanatic and she is as smart as a whip. My great nephew is a tv fanatic and he talks well for his age.We always had a fresh garden when my kids were growing up and I have a daughter that was and still is a picky eater and hardly eats veggies.So you see you are down on yourself for no good reason. You do the best you can for what you have and what you are able to do and just the fact that you wrote the letter and are concerned shows that you are a good loving caring mother and that's what counts. I was told a child would rather have a peanut butter sandwich and loving parent than not.You are fine.|`|uoKXojguaa	All I can say is Your always gona make mistakes.......ALWAYS either by your standards your husbands, your moms or your friends standards BUT All you can do is try & do your best!!!  Its normal to have first mom jitters & guilts But dont let it stress you out  Good luck|`|Xnr5Y7Coaa	I'm not a mommy yet but I did have a lot to do with my sisters while they were growing up.  I think that due to the circumstances you are doing a wonderful job. Just the fact that you have concerns means that you are worried but you try your best for your child.    I plan on breastfeeding my child and then cooking for him when he's ready. I have the support of my bf so this is of big help for me.    Just keep trying your best, I'm sure your toddler will grow up to be a healthy, happy child.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	Like the other response said, every parent is going to make mistakes.  All we can do is to try our best and go from there.  And if we realize that we're making mistakes, we can try to change our behavior little by little or know to do better with the next child (if something can't be undone).  I try to learn from my friends and family about what kinds of things worked for them and what they felt they'd done wrong and then incorporate what works for me into my life.    We've gone through phases where I let the kids watch too much TV, and then I'll vow to do better, and we'll find non-TV things to do for a while (crafts, reading books, playing outside, etc.).  It's more work, but it's worth it in the long run.    We also don't always eat as well as we should, but I try to continue to offer a variety of fruits and vegetables (fresh, frozen, and sodium-free canned) and other healthy foods.  I heard these words of wisdom once -- our job is to provide our children with a healthy diet, and it's their job to eat.  We can't make them eat if they don't want to, but we can continue to offer good food, and they will learn to like it.  Also, there's no harm in making meals fun.  Let your son eat peas with a toothpick (my girls love this), give him carrots with peanut butter or ranch dressing as an "appetizer," let him make mini-sandwiches with tiny pieces of bread, meat, and veggies, etc.      Sometimes I yell too much, and every day, I try hard to take a deep breath, decide what's truly important, and think of other ways to get through to the kids besides yelling.  I just have to take things one day at a time.    As a single mother who's working full-time and going to school, you have one of the hardest jobs in the world.  Just take each day one day at a time, try to incorporate advice from friends and family into your life, get help when you need it, and remember that children grow up so quickly, and before you know it, he'll be off in school.    Honestly, I wish I could have relaxed more with my first daughter.  I was so worried about trying to do what I was "supposed to" that sometimes I forgot to follow my instincts and just enjoy her as she was.  Your son won't take his bottle to college with him, and there's still plenty of time to teach him healthy eating habits and get him doing non-TV activities.  Play with him, talk to him, and read to him, and the rest will come.    Good luck to you!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	u can only do waht you can no one is perfect at parenting a kids or kids they have their taste as well   i jsut gave my toddler a cookie and watch tv so i can have a minute too me Guess what she will be ok carrot or cookie
pDRAciBnaa	i really wouldn't worry about her hands,i think all babies get cold hands at night...this is partly down to the fact that a babies circulatory system isn't as developed as an adults so extremities get colder quicker! if it bothers her she will wake to tell you :)|`|heoBp6Taaa	Like every one is saying mittens or even socks.. Hands aren't as important to keep warm as the chest and feet are.. Remember over dressing/heating has been linked to sids, (not trying to scare you just want you to be aware).|`|Iu0AJDviaa	I had the same thing happen with all of my 7 kids and really if its not bothering them and they are still sleeping through it then dont stress over it. If they dont warm up after say 20 minutes after she wakes then maybe see a doctor about it,as it might be something else.  But i know how you feel,it stumped me the first few times aswell.xx|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I honestly wouldn't worry about her hands. Her head and feet are the most important body parts to keep warm,since that's where you can lose heat the easiest. Don't want her to overheat.   If you're worried about her room being cold. Try insulating her window a bit better.|`|wFVLP5l3aa	put mittens on her hands|`|o7bYWjy7aa	try socks on her hands but iv seen grow suits up to size 1 by bonds you could also try a long sleeve top to big and sow the hands over|`|HVWAq4u9aa	They make mittens for her size...even the ones with actual fingers in them.  I saw them at Target this winter.  Or just put some socks on her hands.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	WalMart sells small mittens.  I know what you're going thru.  I have cold paws all the time.  I sleep with my feet in a heating pad daily. (Paws-dog breeder)    She should grow out of that or warm up when the weathe turns warm.  Maybe try putting a space heater unit in her room so she doesn't get so cold.    I've got cold spots in my house as well and I live in Texas.  I just feel cold all the time.  I'm so used to 105* that even 40* feels unbearable to me.    By the way, the gloves are really cheap.

Georgia  2. Jack  3. Kiki or Kitty (nickname for Katherine or Kaitlin or Kathleen)  4. I don't really think Catherine works, I always think of Katharine Hepburn who is so not the mean girl. I'm feeling more of a trendy name, like Kacie or Madison or Hallie. However, if you want a Scottish name, you mentioned she has red hair and green eyes--two elements I associate with fire, you could try Kenna (its a variation of Cinaed, which is a male Scottish name meaning "fire")    On that note, here are some other names that have meanings related to what you mentioned.  1. Emily (after Emily Dickinson), Maya (Maya Angelou)--I actually kind of like this, Gwendolyn (Gwendolyn Brooks), Sylvia (Sylvia Plath), Dorothy (Dorothy Parker--you could call her Dottie!), Gertrude (Gertrude Stein, Gert is kind of quirky). I like names with meanings, so I think it would really be poignant if you pick a name of a famous poet    2. This is just kind of the "good guy" name, so I really like Jack, Tim, Will, Ben, Andrew, James..strong standards that don't ever really go out of style but are just always around    3. These names all mean "happy": Abigail, Letitia, Xanthe. I still like Kiki or Kitty though, they're just such happy, quirky names.     4. Here are some Scottish names: Abi, Aileen, Ainsley (this works), Blair, Caoimhe (its pronounced KEE-vah), Catriona (if you're looking for a variant of Catherine), Elspet, Fiona, Greer (this sounds mean), Moira, Rhona, Sheena, Una    Good luck!|`|gyhVnBN9aa	14 year old girl: Rosie  16year old  Boy:Johnny  14year old girl: Stacy  16 year old girl: Victoria

But if they are for your own use, I think it's okay to even talk toddler pics, there is a difference between an inappropriate picture, and a mom loving her baby, and I don't think it's age that is the difference, ya know what I mean!    Oh, and just print them at home, and keep'em for your self!|`|xXnFx6qLaa	I still do it... I think his lil' butt is adorable, lol.  I don't show those to everyone though, lol|`|63a5d617239afd4f62c7622fb8d95be3aa	I think anything up untill 4/5 is ok. I have a adorable nakey pic of my little girl, she is on her tummy with her head up and rosey red cheecks! Soo cute. There never going to be this tiny again so why not remember everything, even how tiny their bottoms are!|`|ehvzQRkkaa	9 months is fine!!!  6 years old, not okay!|`|J3TRJPIwaa	I think 3-4 yrs old should be the limit. 9 months is fine, snap away!!|`|Grmsgziaaa	Wow, Andie R isnt a biznatch. NOT.  Anyways dont worry, how cute! I would do it maybe until 2 or 3 years. 4 years is a bit over the top, it really depends on what they are doing though, in the pic.|`|33h5R8nTaa	I took a video of my daughter in the bath last night and she was nakey. She is 7 months old. i think till they get a year its ok...After that only if its really really really cute, like if they panted the bathtube with tub paint or something like that. I never think twice of getting a nakey shot.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	Sometime after a year, or when they start covering their privates. It`s a family`s choice, ( some families are more conservative than others). I have a photo of my 14 month old son`s  little bum running away from me.No fronts, only cute tushie.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	I think there is no set age...just don't be posting any pics you aren't sure about on your facebook or myspace or even showing friends. Use your discretion.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	My mom has pic of me 3 years old naked dripping with suds from my bath, I had escaped and was running wild. LOL . At this age mommy, snap away. You can embarrass her when she gets engaged later on in life...lol    ** hmm I must have missed the rude comment..darn.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	I think bum pictures are fine for the first three years. I have several pictures of my daughter in the tub with a strategically placed wash cloth, rubber duck, bubbles... They are so cute! Snap away. You'll want to cherish those memories forever.|`|yPNvecc7aa	My mom has naked pictures of me covered in her lipstick at the age of 4. I think you're safe for now!  ; )|`|5SpMKvpYaa	Never. You should be happy with how you or your young children look and taking a photo is the easiest way of remembering how cute you or they were. (also a easy way to embarrass someone!)|`|syVPYmXWaa	i have nakey pics from when i was 4, and im not embarresed of them or anything lol|`|9X09kM4oaa	dont listen to the rude comments- they obviously dont understand. I'd say anything over 2-3 is to much- but hey your the mom its your preference!|`|7XuzRloXaa	She's still a baby, go ahead and take as many pix of her without clothes on now! I'd say 2 yrs. would be the limit for me to be taking pix of my daughter's. I have a 4 year old, and think that she's too old to be taking naked bath tub shots.|`|XCAmYXeqaa	I would say that anything under the age of 5 seems normal to me. Some people may say younger but it all depends on who will be seeing the pictures.   Theres some pretty perverted people out there- So you have to be careful.   But remember- She is YOUR child. You gave birth to her and if you want a few cute picture of her childhood. (Which only come once in a liffetime) Then you should take them ! Shes your baby and shes going to grow up very fast.   If you decide you want to change your mind about the pictures later- Its as simple as throwing them away.  Plus think about how fun it will be to show them to her boyfriend 20 years from now =]|`|zQAWuMN4aa	Um, Macy, do you realize your wrote "nakey"??  LOL!    Anyway, we still take pics of our daughter whenever we want. She's almost 11 months old. To me it's still ok.     And when I felt it wasn't right anymore is when I'd stop.    Nakey nakey nakey!!! LOL!|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	I don't think 9 months is too old at all.  We still take naked pictures of my 10 month old.  As long as you aren't sharing them with others besides those who see her album or scrapbook.|`|AA11210211	I'm not sure really,I guess when we feel they are too old,my son is 3 1/2 and I still take nakey pictures on him,It's so cute he has a mole above his right butt cheek!! lol
Z7V7AbBQaa	The height is only a guide line since some babies are long in the body and others are long in the legs. The child is too tall of the seat when there is 1inch or less from the top of babies head to the top of the car seat.<br>  <a href="http://www.carseatsite.com/installing_your_car_seat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.carseatsite.com/installing_yo...</a><br>  <br>  There have been no documented cases of rear-facing children breaking their legs, hips or feet because of their feet touching the back of the vehicle seat. Even if the child's legs did break, it is much easier to repair broken legs then it is to repair broken necks and ruptured spinal cords. From being turned too early so if you do change seats make sure baby is rear facing till 1 year and 20-22 lbs. but baby is safer rear facing as long *** possible<br>  <a href="http://www.kyledavidmiller.org/pages/420..." rel="nofollow">http://www.kyledavidmiller.org/pages/420...</a>|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Sarah and Gracies -   I think that the height limit is for the stroller, not the carseat.   I know my carseats height limit was up to 22 lbs. and 29 inches.    I am not for sure, I just think 38 1/2 in. seems very tall for an infant seat to go up to.<br>  <br>  I will try and look around for the specs on the carseat as well.<br>  <br>  I looked at like 5 sites as well, that a tough carseat to track down.<br>  <br>  I think in this case the best bet would be to contact the manufactuers customer service and ask.  You definetly don't want to be putting your son in a carseat he has outgrown.  Good luck.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	<a href="http://products.howstuffworks.com/safety-1st-fleet-travel-system-01948-review.htm" rel="nofollow">http://products.howstuffworks.com/safety...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I answered the other question you had about this , and I believe I found the limits for you...he has about 9 more inches before he is in limit. <br>  <br>  <br>  Product SpecsWeight 39.5 lbs<br>  .Front bar yes<br>  Harness type stroller: 3-point; <br>  car seat: 5-point<br>  Storage compartments yes, <br>  underneath Brakes yes<br>  Number of seats 1 for car seat, 1 for stroller<br>  Reclines yes<br>  Canopy yes<br>  Height 38-1/2 in.<br>  Weight capacity stroller: 40 lbs.<br>  <br>  --yea I thought it was too long as well, but I have looke dat all th esites I could find and these were the only ones I could find with limits to them.|`|nCF0BwJ1aa	If you are speaking of an infant carrier type of car seatt, you should definitely have him switched over to a rear facing car seat once he reaches the hight limit.  It is dangerous for the baby's feet to be hanging over the end of an infant carrier.  If you are unsure of the hight requirement, but think you may be exceeding it, I would err on the side of caution and switch him over to a car seat that can be used as early as a newborn (i.e. the 3-in-1 types).  It is always better to be overly cautious in my opinion when it comes to car seats.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	Worry about the weight limit, not the height limit.  It won't kill them to have their legs bent.  And keep them rear facing until 1 year minimum.|`|RzYePezkaa	Once he can sit unsupported and weighs above I believe 19lbs depending on the car seat also should be rear facing until he is 1.
Bhy4k9wPaa	As long as they aren't tight or constricting, or used all the time, then they'll be fine. You want to give their feet oom to grow so try not to have them on all the timee.<br>  <br>  I didn't put proper hard soled shoes on any of my children until they were walking confidentally. Until then I only put on booties or soft soled shoes other than for their baptisms when they had fancy little shoes!|`|PDHCOrOSaa	My baby just started wearing shoes at 1 year when we go out.<br>  <br>  She learned to walk in bare feet and still prefers to be barefoot.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	My son wore shoes as  a newborn although he never kept them on. He had on a cute pair when he got his first pictures done. I just could not pass them up they were so cute and small!<br>  <br>  He is  4 months now and has discovered his feet and loves playing with his toes. I have tried to put shoes on him but he wont keep them on.<br>  <br>  I think it would be just fine to put shoes on your little girl!<br>  Good luck getting her to keep them on  =]|`|LXpjIH0Haa	I have these little adorable shoes, I put them on my baby sometimes when we go out and she's not in a one piece. It keeps her socks from falling off. My cousin used to put shoes onto her baby everyday, even over a stretchy. It looks cute and it shouldn't bother them.|`|lGcpXteaaa	I put baby shoes on my little one as soon as she were born. But they were all booties so they didnt affect anything.<br>  I mostly have her wear socks but if we are going out anywhere special she has always worn shoes.<br>  <br>  I just stay away from the hard soled shoes, there is no need for them just yet!|`|YSahnI9Maa	The night she wouldnt stop crying.|`|3FcZSs3Waa	Ha! This is something me and my husband disagree on, although is has started giving in. My son is 7 months old and almost anytime we go anywhere, I put shoes on him. This has started since he was about a week old. My thinking is, we wear shoes so should he. I want him to get used to them. Just make sure they aren't too heavy. I love little canvas shoes because they are cute and lightweight! I know they outgrow them pretty fast, so I refuse to spend more then 10 bucks on a pair.|`|1S7uXsInaa	I started younger than that.  Nothing with a hard sole.  A lot of shoes with the soft bottoms are no harder than socks.  I found the booties and shoes helpful, especially in the winter, because they could not just pull their socks off.|`|A3sIn87Qaa	I say its your decision, but from my experience the sooner the better. I put shoes on my first at 3 months. My second I let him wear socks and had a hard time later with getting him to wear shoes. So my third one got shoes at 6wks.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	well i bought shoes for my baby & honestly it was a waist of money bc he dont like them & at the moment he just tryin to walk & it bothers him with them on i am not buying anymore until he is walking enough to use them|`|2a726b94b1136e6caf4d74c8981c9e24aa	When he was 8 months old, because it was the only way to keep his feet warm when we were out (he'd take his socks off and chew on them).<br>  <br>  Overall, he prefers to be barefoot.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	No you can put shoes on her it wont hurt or affect her at all|`|lfV7WgF9aa	I put shoes on my son and he is 10 weeks old.<br>  It's winter and I don't think jut socks are warm enough for where I live.|`|AA10745032	when ever u feel like it but its beat when they are born so they can get used to wearing shoes|`|vCWVimTzaa	I started a little before she was able to walk, mainly because it was winter and she kept pulling her socks off so the shoes were more to keep her socks on and feet warm than anything else. She fell in love with her little boots though, and started asking for them all the time. I found a soft slipper type I let her wear around the house and if we are going out I put real shoes on her.|`|Zmay11uvaa	It's fine. <3 hope I helped. And she is so cute from the pic!!
CKEn0oHVaa	Hi there i am at 34 weeks of my third pregnancy and on my last pregnancy i went a few days overdue and it drove me crazy!! The best advice i can offer is to try to relax and switch off from it a bit. Easier said than done i know!!!!!! That is what i did i just thought oh nothings happening and the next morning my contractions started!!! Good Luck xxx|`|5jjGo6XTaa	well u r  right that its not uncomin for first time moms to go more then 40 weeks but you body does seem to be getting close to go into labar. you can try caster oil you can get it at the supper marker take a 2tbsp in the morning 2 at night this will make you contract many women will swear by it. this is how it works this oil is taking when you need to go number 2 and cant. so like contractions and number 2s your body is pushing and making the same movment. It helps it moves things along. you might have a messy labor if you kno what i mean but it works.|`|8iBOF2h5aa	Well, you are already doing everything that I would have suggested. Just be patient. I'm sure It will happen any day now. As long as your Dr. visits are normal you are fine. I know how hard it is to wait when you are right there. You just want your baby here now...lol GOOD LUCK!!!<br>  <br>  add: oh and it is good that you walk everyday. I hear that helps with the length of labor :)|`|Xtyu4wphaa	u will have it soon, i swear! heebahy thuyre shababahiy! theyre ! u will have it in the next three days and i am not ******* around. i swear!|`|ckgiPMm4aa	All children, and labors, and pregnancys are different.<br>  When I was preganant with my daughter, I went 2 days over due, when the Dr was concerned that I might not be able to handle labor if she was to get any bigger, and had to induce me. My labor lasted 36 hours, and was extreamly painful.<br>  But my mother went all the way to 42 weeks for me. Her labor was nautral, 45 minutes long, and it was over so fast, she doesnt even remember being in pain.<br>  <br>  The point is, don't be worried, EVERYONE is different. And unless your Dr is worried, don't be. Your child will come when it's good and ready, i promise you.<br>  <br>  Good luck until then, re-fold baby clothes, read a book, do some more shopping, it'll be awhile before you have some time to yourself.|`|obXAeNW5aa	the baby will come when he ready not much you can do but wait and that the hardest thing to do. just keep on doing what your doing and i bet by sunday u will have a new baby congrat|`|44OH7Si6aa	Isn't it frustrating? My son had to be induced because he was at 42 weeks and still showing no sign of wanting to come out. You go to the store and all you see is babies, for some reason as soon as you pass your due date all the other pregnant women you've noticed around town disappear and all of a sudden there are tiny babies being pushed down every aisle of the grocery store. You feel like you are literally the last pregnant woman left in the world. As far as trying to naturally induce you r labor you can try sex, walking, eating spicy foods, drinking raspberry tea, eating pineapples, nipple stimulation, and I am sure there are many more things you could find if you google it. Does any of it work? eh. Some women try sex and walking and it works, or possibly they just coincidentally go into labor. Some women have sex three times a day and take long walks daily and still don't go into labor. Discuss your induction options with your doctor. I know you want it to happen naturally so only discuss the "worst case scenario" once the Dr. can give you a date the baby will be induced on if you don't go into labor it will help, trust me. That way you know that there is a finish line and it helps to make the days go by a little faster in the meantime.|`|MbmHripJaa	everyone is going to probably get mad at me for saying this but take castor oil.. it does not hurt the baby-- my friend just did it with her baby because she couldnt take it anymore-- and your baby is full term-- there is no worry if you dont want to do that because the most the doctor will let you go at is 42 weeks.. scheduele do get induced.|`|IdWleKAyaa	Some woman just have longer pregnancies..there is nothing wrong and if both you and baby are healthy there is no need to induce. Inductions can cause alot of problems like c-sections<br>  This woman talks about the problems with induction here is her website<br>  www.glorialemay.com/blog<br>  Good luck|`|JzY8x9Umaa	Calm down! Why wouldnt you be asking your doctor this?<br>  Your fine. 3 days is nothing. It will happen when baby is ready.|`|be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	I would say if your doctor is monitoring you regularly, and baby is still healthy, then your okay. I wouldn't be too concerned with being induced, as many women are induced everyday. My sister in law has had 4 babies, and she has had to be induced with every single one. Her body just doesn't give up her babies. Although petocin does seem to make contractions more intense, there are means of pain control, if that's what your worried about. <br>  <br>  I know it doesn't help, but just thought I would comment.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	I went 41 weeks with my 1st and 40 weeks, 5 days with my 2nd. With this one, I am sure I will 40 weeks, 3 days. <br>  This is your 1st, you may be looking at another 4 days. And whats 4 days really? Think about how many other 4 days you have gotten through.
h57t7FAjaa	Af came last for me on the 18th (was supposed to be the 14th though).    And yea the waits been killing me too :)  Everytime I feel something I'm like maybe?  So i know what you mean!!  the 2ww is the hardest.    Lots of Baby Dust to you, and hopefully the twinges are the good kind!!|`|z6BtwSE8aa	I just got my period yesterday, and on the 2ww I was picking apart every little symptom I thought I was having. I was hopeful because I thought I was having  a lot of promising symptoms, but I was obviously wrong.|`|eHlPh9Cmaa	yes im in the same exact boat. i hope you get your BFP
3EhoJ42zaa	I would want to be completely effaced first (thinned).  With my first I dilated to 10cm but was still 85% effaced.  My son was right there and I had to push so bad but I wasn't allowed to otherwise I would have ripped my cervix.  That labor took about 5 and a half hours.  With my second I was 4cm 80% effaced the day before I delivered.  Then when I got to the hospital I was 100% effaced and at 7cm.  That labor was only 3 hours.  I would prefer to be completely effaced then be completely dilated so you dont have to wait.  Once your 100% and you start dilating it tends to happen faster rather then someone who is 4cm and and barely thinned|`|MqFeJiukaa	It don't really make to much difference from what I know.  I am 4cm dilated 75% effaced and a +1 station and had a membrane sweep.  I am not having any signs of labor.  I was told at my 37 week appt where I was 3cm and not effaced at all that its normal to not efface or dilate before labor.  I am pregnant with my 5th and with my first I went into labor at 41 weeks 1cm 50% effaced and with my 4th at 41 weeks I was 2cm and not effaced.  So I personally don't think it makes a difference.|`|IdWleKAyaa	Both are ideal but its different with everyone|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I went into labour with no dilation, high and hard cervix.<br>  My baby was born 2 hours later.<br>  There's no way to tell.|`|TC00nL07aa	I was watching this show and that couple had sex and went into labor the next morning...lol|`|eDmdkUO3aa	I think you will go early being completely thinned.|`|AA11457809	if you have sex it helps stimulate everything so that might help|`|14JQ11AUaa	Walk walk walk and have some really good sex!!! You need to have an orgasm ok. It release the natural hormone called "Pitocin" and that is what they give you through IV to induce labor. But it is the real deal...so much much better :) Have fun and good luck :)
dCzoIUP7aa	From those two I would choose the loola up. It does look nicer but more importantly is that it looks sturdy and has good reviews. I prefer ones that can handle grass and a little rough terrain as well like this one:    Icandy Apple Pushchair  http://www.olivers-baby-care.co.uk/Icand...

They're only in these things for five minutes and it's not worth wasting your money.|`|6e72fe5eaebe0f66961aa766d452c09faa	i like the first one best but i thought the silvercross 3d could be rearfacing|`|ZtGThw01aa	Bugaboo Bee Stroller, Red :)|`|nzgZR6onaa	Definitely the loola up.That bugaboo bee looks like something from outer space!|`|IQk2zUseaa	they're both lovely :)  but i'd probably go for the Loola up as it seems to have more storage space to keep your bags and baby bits when your out and about :)|`|J1stiMioaa	take a look at a icandy cherry, it is what i have and its fab (forward or rear facing and very light), my son is 19 months and still looks comfy in it!|`|Ox5dsRQoaa	buy the simpler one|`|BcjFssaEaa	john lewis 4 me   xxx
Hu9yquP4aa	I gained a great deal with my first child. Some water and the rest was my eating. Not saying you are eating unhealthy, but your portion sizes may not be accurate.     I would need to see a list of your foods for the day. But let me say this, you should gain about 1 lb a week the entire pregnancy. That is healthy weight gain. I am at 27 lbs and 26 weeks pregnant. So I am just a tad over my goal. Here is what I eat in a normal day. Compare it to what you are eating and maybe you can see the difference. If not, start writing down what you are eating and then show the OBGYN what you are consuming and see where the issue is.   I know I gained more with my daughter. Are you having a girl?    B~ lite english muffin, 2 egg whites, 1 cup strawberries  Snack~ 1 2% cheese stick, apple, banana  L~ i Campbell's soup at hand, 1 grilled cheese sandwich on lite bread.  apple  Snack~ cottage cheese with fresh raspberries or blueberries, lite popcorn singles bag.   D~ Chicken grilled, salad lite dressing, cheese shredded, croutons  Snack~ Kashi fiber bar, glass of milk.     I also don't eat past 7.30 pm.|`|TGXBcRV1aa	im not sure whats going on here. but the best advice i can say i make sure you are getting your baby the nutrients she needs and then worry about you after you have her. just make sure you are not starving yourself to get skinny and as a result, be malnourishing your child :(  just wait it out. eat what you want when your hungry, (which is supposed to keep you healthy, pregnant or not) and make sure to keep your baby healthy and worry about your body after she is here.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Not so much with my first but, my second, YES.  Can your dr refer you to a dietitian.  By this I mean, one who can help you through your pregnancy.  Not, get you to lose weight while prpregnant That would be sisilly and unhealthy.  Don't stress, you are having a bay.  Maybe you will gain your weight at the front of your pregnancy and taper off towards the end???  Could happen.
0bZ6j0aSaa	Josh - since he is the main character, you need an 'attractive', cool name for him.  Josh works, as would Matt and names like Jon, Mike, Chris etc.  Something a little more unusual yet not outlandish would also work...anything that will make him 'cool' with being unaccessable to the readers.    Matt - 'why not change his name to Tom/Thomas - it means 'Twin' ...may be kinda cool since he's not the main character and the name relates to who is character is?    Cloei - I've struggled picking a name here...you say she has lived in France, Romania and England.  How about a name native to where she was born?  Elaina, Amelia, Yvette are some French names, Viviana and Diana are Romanian and Annalise and Edith are quite tradional British/English names.  Personally, I like Elaina and Annalise the best    Pierre - I like this name, but more for the character of Jason (see below).  How about Alexander or some variation of it (Alex, Alastair, Alexandre, Andre etc) The meaning is defender - quite fitting for a ruler of a kingdom!    Jason - Based on the character decription you gave, I'd say call him Pierre rather than Jason.  Pierre sounds like a more mature name than Jason.  The character you describe sounds more mature than his brother.  Also, as I said for Cloei, maybe go with French/Romanian/traditional English/British names for the siblings?    Mitch - This name sounds too nice and is not threatening enough for the bad guy.  I'd also go for an older, more timeless name.  For some reason Caleb and Jacob are coming to mind, not that either is particularly evil...I know twilight fans will hate me for this but Edvard (not Edward) or Jasper might work but given your vampite theme you may be best staying away from this names!    ** if you wanted to name 'Jason' and 'Pierre' names depending on where they were born some other suggestion could be: Marc, Dominique, Anton, Emil, Trey and Spencer    Good luck with your assignment!|`|BcjFssaEaa	Alfie or Malachy?  xxx|`|zg82CYzIaa	I like Josh and Matt, they are good modern names.    I like Cloei it sounds very mysterious    Pierre im not too sure about... what about Athon?    Jason, again, not too sure about, although I think Harley would sound good.    Mitch I dont think sounds evil enough, I think you need something more "fantasy"like how about Xerican?|`|N2e248rTaa	i like them all but i think Josh and Ned go better than Josh and Matt. :D.|`|vvAyfBGCaa	Josh should be changed to Connor and Matt should be Dalton.    Other than that you should be fine. Good luck!|`|2k2ZeUwkaa	josh is nice-matt too boring,Morgan, Culan, Rex  Pierre is boring, maybe Xavier, Storm, Troyden    Good luck
Bhy4k9wPaa	It can vary from woman to woman, and even pregnancy to pregnancy. Babies come in all sizes so that makes a huge difference. But yes i'd say some women are just naturally going to have neat little bumps while some (like I was...) are going to resemble a beached whale lol!! I was HUGE with all 3 pregnancies. Mind you, my babies were all big-with the largest being 9 pound 2 and i'm only 5 foot 4...|`|zxhCy80eaa	I'm on baby number 3 (4 months) I look about 6 or 7 months already. But that's always been the case for me. I'm a mere 5 ft. 2 inches and am very short waisted. I have  nowhere to grow but out. Then I know some women who have the torso of a gazelle and have been small at 9 months pregnant. Of course weight would have something to do with it as well. If someone is on the heavy side they may show later than someone a bit thinner.<br>   Every woman is built differently, therefore every pregnancy different. They're all beautiful.|`|AA11916244	Really i think its all up in the air. Every women is different. Take me for example. I watched my mom and my aunts get just fat and miserable during they're pregnancys. So naturally i thought when i got preggo i would just get huge. My first baby i got really big but i was all belly. My second you couldnt tell for a while and i stayed rather small just barely a bump. Baby ended up being 7 1/2 lbs. This pregnancy im 7 months and just now am starting to pop and i have not gained any weight. So really i dont think there is a way to tell how big you'll get.And genetics doesnt seem to make much of a difference either.|`|vG0tsqJtaa	Doctors who are honest will tell you don't gain more then 20-25lbs.  Problem is a lot of woman use pregnancy as an excuse to eat anything.

I feel your frustration!|`|AA10041941	from what I have heard boats are more costly than what they are worth sounds like you made a crappy investment. SMART getting pregnant by him too.. geez, if you guys fight like kids all the time you OBVIOUSLY shouldn't get married and you really should've been smarter in ALOT of the decisions you have made..can't go back now though..it'll only get worse til one of you decides to GROW UP! Why in the hell would you decide to bring a baby into this world with a man that is so verbally and physically YES he will be physically abusive.. its just pathetic! someone should call child welfare on you guys.. geez!|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	I wouldn't worry about the boat, I would worry about the fact that you're staying with a man that calls you stupid.  How could you do that to your son, let alone to yourself?  He will be calling your son names pretty soon as well.  Don't think that it will only be you that gets the "special" treatment.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I would first ask him if he understand that he is talking like that to you and your the mother of his child? How rude for him to say that to you. Anyways, it is your boat and your money that bought it so I would tell him to screw off and if he does mess with the boat then I would tell him I would have him arrested. See how he likes that lol

reO9Dgmsaa	I never fed Sophie baby food.  For about a month I steamed veggies once a week, coarsely mashed them and froze cubes of it.  Then I chucked the mashing idea and gave her small pieces to chew herself.  Babies mash food with their gums, so the amount of teeth they have is irrelevant.  Go ahead and offer her pieces of avocado, banana, peaches, blueberries, steamed veggies like carrots, green beans, sweet potatoes, etc.  You can also add spices now; they are interesting and healthful!  I enjoyed giving Sophie applesauce or pumpkin mixed with plain yogurt and a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg.    Sophie ate chunks of steak and chicken at 9-10 months!  Just watch your girl carefully.  :)|`|pvH3oHRfaa	I would make her food yourself. That way you know exactly what's going in to it. It's actually quite fun making up tiny meals! Try doing batches of whatever you're making her; you can then freeze portions of it to use at a later date.|`|Ca5n28eVaa	Home cooked cos its healthier and u know wat is goin in to it|`|pDRAciBnaa	dont worry about it to much,the point is shes eating now!! thats important,just try to make her a few home cooked things a week maybe start off once or twice a week,cauliflower cheese is sooo easy,pasta stars with tinned tomatos and cheese...these are all simple and im sure she would love them. but just bare in mind one day you will have to prepare something yourself 3times a day for her,so you best start to learn :)|`|heoBp6Taaa	Home cooked pureed veges are definitely more healthy. Seens as your bub is already 8 months old you may find she will be a little fussy if you find that she is try mixing the bought food with the home made stuff gradually increasing the home cooked food until that's all she's having..    Good luck|`|CY8jAXPDaa	Maybe start to introduce finger foods for her from home - such as Toast, Sandwiches (cut into strips) cheese strings, Organic Crisps (they're big a chunky and melt in there mouth)     I gave my son bought food (HIPP organic) until he was 10 mos old.   But i regret doing so, i wish i hard prepared my own meals for him from around 7mos +   With my next child i will certainly cook home cooked meals from scratch from 7mos because i can make them highly nutritious too.  I kind of felt slightly like i was giving him processed food, rather than proper food (even though it wasn't)     It is ok, but maybe start to introduce your own foods?|`|ICYHLdraaa	get her used to your home cooking as early as possbile , its more nutritional aswell :) that way she wont be picky when she grows up
4wLBivFFaa	well they say military position, and doggy style  (because of gravity) but i dont really think position matters, its mainly just working out when your ovulationg and trying to have sex around that time. this is my 3rd month of trying and im just having sex as much as possible especially around the time of ovulation !! also after sex try and lie flat on your back pillow under your bum for 15-20 mins before you go for a wee, wash etc. just dont get to stressed and relax, i know its hard but wishing you lots of luck and baby dust x x|`|fNE7Q7e8aa	A man-on-top position will work good.  Put a pillow or a cushion under your hips after  the sex and stay laying down for 30mins or so  to help sperm swim up.    In my case we usually do it from behind  (doggie) and I am pregnant now  Doggie style will help your partner ejaculate  close to your cervix.    Tons of baby dust to you and  good luck:))
rmse6Mj8aa	D&C is a procedure for what they call a 'missed miscarriage' where conception has occurred but the pregnancy is not viable. it is necessary to go in and remove the embryo.    the abbreviations we use on here are regarding trying to conceive i will do my best to remember them all.    firs of all:  ttc =  trying to conceive  opk = ovulation prediction test  hpt = home pregnancy test  cm = cervical mucous  ewcm= egg white cervical mucous (fertile grade cm)  o = ovulation  dpo = days past ovulation  bd = baby dancing / sex  dh = dear husband  dd / ds = dear daughter / dear son  af = aunt flo - your period  tmi = too much information  bfp = big fat positive (with regard to pregnancy tests)  bfn - big fat negative (with regard to pregnancy tests)  bm = bowel movement  fmu = first morning urine    that's all i can think of right now. hope that helps|`|BaXruEcqaa	Well I see someone explained the D&C already.  But the other ones you are probably wondering about are as follows:    AF--aunt flow  CM--cervical mucus  DPO--days past ovulation  BD--baby dance (sex)  DH--dear husband  OPK--ovulation predictor kit  HPT--home pregnancy test    Any others i've missed just ask!|`|jC1Mdsefaa	abreviations for what? you might want to specify.  A d & c is where they "clean" out your uterus, it normally happens after a complicated birth has happened, or a miscarriage or abortion.    I had one after I delieverd my youngest daughter, the doctor had to scrape out the rest of the placenta, due to previa, and a placental abruption.  Sounds worse than it was. :-)|`|Ar6wD9Oeaa	A D & C is also known as a dilation and curettage. It is frequently performed when a pregnant woman is known to have suffered a miscarriage, blighted ovum or missed abortion (Where the baby died but a miscarriage did not occur.). A D & C is not always necessary after or during a miscarriage. Its only needed if the miscarriage was not complete. Its kind of like a cleaning.. it helps get everything else out of the uterus.    It is an outpatient surgery using a general anesthesia, meaning you are asleep for the procedure. After you are asleep, a series of tools called dilators are used to open the cervix (mouth of your uterus). Then a hollow tube is placed through the open cervix to remove whatever tissue remains in the uterus. The whole surgery lasts just a few minutes.
BA3y6MBlaa	My two Golden Retrievers and they were  were their oblivous marvelous loving selves.  I did have a pug as a  little girl that was a total one person-type dog, I was her world, and I could see how if my emotions varied she would've been really sensitive to that.  She couldn't quit pooping in the house - MY BABY! - and my Mom gave her back to my grandparents.   Pugs love very deeply don't they? Your story was so endearing.  It was your energy, I believe, that affected  thier behavior, they've got your back.  Lucky you, having healthy babies and two sweethearts.    My Goldens died last year at age 14, I'm still dealing with it.  They were really sweet with my baby and then toddler and then little boy (he's 6).  He walked on them, pulled ears, pretty much tortured them and they would just look at me..."help, Mommy".     When they are older dogs, they do get cranky though.  And if they don't  feel well or have pain sometimes, they are too stoic for their own good.  Thanks for my Pug baby memory.  It was me and her against the world for one summer, and she was a teddy bear at night.  They called him Pugly Ugly - I just knew him as my best friend.|`|TSsT8QGgaa	i woke up in labor and went about my business of "gettin ready to go" as i sat on the floor for my mom to braid my hair,,,my dogs laid beside me and watched me intently.  they followed me around the house as i was packing and gettin ready to leave.  while i was pregnant my dog would lay in my lap (not an easy thing to do as i was pregnant with twins and my dog was a 90  rottweiler).  she could feel the babies moving and kicking at her and would watch my belly in wonder.  dogs have a sense about them.  they can pick up on your behavior as well as the changes in your scent.|`|iikdZKO7aa	Its amazing what animals can sense! Especially dogs.   The have a heightened sense of smell compared to humans so maybe they could smell a change in you. They are smart little animals.|`|lc57ntoFaa	I wonder the same thing. My cat likes to be up my butt 24/7. If she doesn't have me in sight, she starts meowing, and whining. She also likes to sleep with-in a foot of my belly. It's kind of cute actually. She's normally not the "cuddly type", likes to chase after her jingle balls, and do cat things, but ever since my little man dropped in my belly, she's been super lovey, and VERY protective. She glares at my husband when he touches the belly. So maybe animals do know when you're pregnant. Hmm.
d7b00d65a4a0a70a9b59070cac92a1feaa	i have done this before.  i did it to move my period for a trip to the beach.  i wouldn't suggest it or make a habit of it. i started the new pack when i should of been off for a week.  i didn't have a period that month. it did pick right back up the next month...just a week later.  it worked fine.  i understand special occasions and all.  hope you and    hubby have a nice time!|`|AA11110297	let us know ---   each persons body is different --- birth control can be used to regulate periods|`|2cd053401e716b5f18a7c0b6132e83deaa	i am a guy and i know this.  I have a wife.  Birth control only stops the egg from starting.  Your period is still going to come.  You can regulate it better if you take your pills.  I heard that you can stop a period if you continue to take the pink ones, i think?|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	Birth control is not menses control.  You'd better discuss all this with your doctor because you're confused
AA12324955	No, I've never actually heard of anyone I know benefiting from this blood.  But what I do know is that it's important for your baby to get all the blood from their cord at birth.  After your baby is born, the doctors should let the cord pulsate until it's done.  That blood is the best blood your baby could have, and is very oxygenated and full of all sorts of good stuff.  Maybe we'd have less sick babies if we'd give them all the benefits that God designed for them...|`|AA11188099	You should sign up - or rather your brother should sign up for Newborn Possibilities. http://cordblood.com/newborn/welcome.asp...    You can save the cord blood at no cost.  I definitely think you should look into it.|`|AA10959322	I have never known anyone but I think it is a wonderful thing.|`|8ba6772411ce2fa9565b98ebe96d6a0aaa	i wanted to donate my son's but the hospital he was born at didn't accept donations. my obstetrician and pediatrician said if there is no family history of health problems it is not necessary. you should use your money to save for the child's education instead. why break the bank when you probably will never need it. cord banking is ridiculously expensive.|`|c48afdc3bf4b6c1c186518faf5e86417aa	I do not know anyone who has, and the chances of her needing it later are actually pretty slim.  I would use the money for college.  If her mom is dead-set on doing this (and I'm not saying it's a waste of money)  she will get the money herself.  Good luck!|`|AA11126707	I donated both my kids cord blood and one was recently chosen to be used for a patient with bone cancer.  They call to follow up on the child before using it to make sure the donor is healthy.  It made me cry I was so happy to help someone's fight with cancer a little easier and it cost me nothing. You could always donate to the cord blood bank if you can't afford to save it for private use.
NqQyFElCaa	You can get any mix of the two parents in their child. It's completely possible for two very dark-haired/eyed people to end up with a blonde, blue-eyed baby. It just means that they're carrying the genes for the blonde hair and blue eyes, just not expressing them.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Darker genes are the more dominate genes, but that doesn't mean that the baby will have the darker traits.  It depends on how many dominant and recessive genes they have in the family.  Like if there are more people in both your family, and the baby's father's family that have blue eyes (a recessive gene) then the baby will have blue eyes!    Oh, and all Caucasian babies are born with a slate coloured eye, but they can change any time up until they are one, or even older!|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My mom has black hair, and dark brown eyes. My dad had blonde hair and blue eyes. I have blonde hair & blue eyes...as I've gotten older, my hair has gotten a bit darker, but not much.|`|zQQd2wPRaa	I used to figure this out in biology. I think the male gene,no matter what, is normally more donimant.|`|33h5R8nTaa	I have dark hair and dark eyes but my daughter has a light brown and blue eyes with a dark blue outline. like a sunburst blue, its really cool actually. her hair is light for now but i think it will get darker when she gets older...|`|BypjotRpaa	i have jet black hair, brown eyes..my husband has dirty blond hair blue eyes.. our son was born with jet black hair. but now has hair lighter then my husbands and my son has light blue eyes, sort of grey blue.|`|4MjSgjAAaa	my two sons are total opposite but are both from the same father i have dark brown hair and blue eyes and my husband has red hair and Green/blue eyes my first son has really light blonde hair, pale completion and light blue eyes, my second son has a light brown hair which is coming in lighter and dark blue eyes and a darker completion, i thought they both would have red hair as it is a very dominant colour but i was lucky lol but my grand children will prob have red hair though|`|sqaey2Siaa	I have blonde hair and blue eyes.   My husband has jet black hair. dark brown eyes and dark skin.    Our son has. dark brown hair. light brown/ hazel eyes. tan complection.     I think he got the perfect mix.|`|NroZQN5vaa	I think most babies are born with blue eyes and they change through out the first 18 months. I don't think the baby's eye color is set in stone yet.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	yes darker is dominant but if the dark haired person have a lighter color in there genes also. but not its not impssible and at 9 months she might still change colors.|`|4uqj8Nf1aa	I am mixed race black hair brown eyes and my babe is like a milk bottle with kindo blondy browny hair! she has brown eyes tho! yeyyy me!|`|w4zjmhxoaa	If the person with the dark brown hair carries the recessive gene for blonde hair and blue eyes, then it's possible.    I have dark brown hair, dark brown eyes -- so does everyone else in my immediate family.  My husband has blonde hair and blue eyes    Our son has blonde hair and brown eyes.  I carry a recessive gene for blonde hair....somewhere back...=)|`|pCxM717naa	Yes dark eye/skin/hair colour are usually dominant. However it is absolutely possible to inherit blond hair or blue eyes rather than brown.  It is also possible for genetic traits that cause hair/skin or eye colouring to lie dormant for a generation and to resurface. So a child born to blond hair blue eye parents could inherit red hair or dark skin from grandparents or great-grandparents.    I am blond with blue eyes and my bf has brown hair+eyes. Our daughter is blond+blue eyed. Her eyes are definetly staying blue (she is 15mths now), but I think her hair will darken as she gets older, because she has dark eyelashes.    Your baby's eye/hair colour could still change. Final eye colour should be apparent by 1yr, but blond hair can darken at age 5/6/7 etc etc    Hope this helps x|`|e8a883abc71de66439c711669c6f3a9aaa	Not necessarily...it depends on whose genes are dominant.
yrDqtazLaa	No, you don't have to have morning sickness, a lot of women don't get sick at all throughout their pregnancy.    If she had even one positive test, that means she is pregnant, it is very very rare to find a false positive result. They only look for one thing, and that is the HCG hormone (this hormone is typically only created when a woman is pregnant). Congrats, dad! Tell her to call an OB/GYN and get it confirmed!|`|veO1RXrCaa	Nope some women avoid it totally.  It would be more of a lack of a period/positive test/blood test to confirm.      ETA I agree with the poster above me.  If she got positives I would get blood work done.|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	No, not every woman gets morning sickness.  And for those who do have it, it doesn't always start right away, sometimes it waits to show itself until the second trimester.  She might be a lucky woman and not have morning sickness at all.  Or it could rear it's ugly head a few months into the pregnancy.|`|FgAPXhVRaa	I did not have morning sickness. I go sick a few times at night around 13 weeks, other than that... I had nothing except exhaustion, sore breasts, and back pain! So yes she could be pregnant... if I were her I would get into see the doctor as soon as she can!!!|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	While some women never get morning sickness while they are pregnant, your fiancee may simply not be far enough along to have gotten morning sickness yet. Low HCG in very early pregnancy may also explain the 2 negative tests (i.e. false negatives).|`|Xnr5Y7Coaa	I didn't have any symptoms at all during my first pregnancy.  With this pregnancy I think I started symptoms before I even missed my period.    Every woman is different, she got the postive tests, I think you should make an appointment with the doctor.    Good luck.|`|2cstdEkIaa	i didnt have it at first, and no it doesnt define pregnancy. go see her obgyn and get a blood test. i was extremely tired and hungry at first..sick about 3 weeks later|`|iQ70p3nJaa	it's not needed...morning sickness comes depending on who you are and how your body deals with pregnancy...    my stepmom didn't have bad morning sickness she just had a headache and wasn't hungry and a little nauseous|`|eGscNMTOaa	I did not have it at all, but I was nausea's and only at night. Tell her to make an appointment with her ob. That's the only way to really know for sure. Good Luck!|`|75zggy81aa	i had horrible morning sickness my first pregnancy and this pregnancy i have NONE. Go get a blood test. if she got a positive result (even with negatives) i'd believe she was. a negative can be a misread but a positve can only turn positive if it detects the hormone. morning sickness and other symptoms are never mandatory in pregnancy.|`|rqOIqO7Raa	I would ignore the false negatives, they really don't mean much, its the positives that count! As far as morning sickness, most women don't get it or it comes around nine weeks so it is not a good indicator of pregnancy. Make a doctor appointment and get checked out. I had morning sickness with all three of mine but all my friends had none. So it really just depends on the person.|`|WPI0Z47saa	Definately not. Some women are lucky enough to not get morning sickness. Also it doesn't always happen right away. Both times for me I was between 8 and 10 weeks when I started getting sick. It is possible to get false negative tests (this happens alot), but it is very rare to have a false positive test. So if you got two positives then you should make the first dr's appointment to confirm it because she is more than most likely pregnant. Congratulations!!|`|OU9xnW86aa	A lot of women don't experience morning sickness.    But 2 positives tests mean she is pregnant. There are false negatives, which would explain the negative test results, but there are no false positives.    You two should schedule an appointment with her doctor for a confirmation blood test.|`|NAjBqunSaa	No morning sickness doesn't happen to all women! It doesn't define if she is or isn't. It sounds like she is.. Go find out at the doctor! Good Luck!|`|cBzyOACFaa	I had no sickness or nausea but felt tired but no other symptoms apart from no period.|`|3IWWIhMRaa	i am about 6 weeks and i don't have any sickness. a little sleepy here and there but i don't think you have to have it to define it. i would go to the dr and get a blood test to confirm if she is or not to help ease your minds|`|Hx6SYzPFaa	No, you don't have to have morning sickness to be pregnant.  It is just listed as one of the commonly reported symptoms.  Symptoms vary with each woman and even within each pregnancy of the same woman.  TO be 100% percent positive have her go to the doctor and have them do a pregnancy test and pelvic exam.  But from what I'm reading, it seems as if she is pregnant.|`|Im4x06Qhaa	I am pregnant now... in my second trimester. I never had any morning sickness or nausea. Same as what the others said, get a blood test done and you'll know for sure, but my thought is that she's pregnant. Fatigue and extreme urination are good signs of pregnancy with or without the morning sickness.|`|AA10371609	I had evening sickness.  I never was sick in the morning.    Some women are sick, some aren't.  If she thinks she's pregnant and had a positive home test, she probably is.  She needs to start taking prenatal vitamins right away and make an appointment to see a Dr.  They'll do some in-visit tests to confirm the pregnancy and go from there.    Congrats!|`|B6Mfx5fUaa	My sister and myself are a little less than 2 weeks apart in our pregnancy, and I suffered from the morning sickness, but she did not!  Some women are "lucky" enough to escape it.  I hope you get what you wished for! Best of luck to you! =)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I never got morning sickness in fact a lot of women never get ANY symptoms. If she had two positives she needs to get to the doctor. False negatives happen ALL the time. False positives don't. She's pregnant.

It's endlessly being needed by another human being, and you have less and less time for a partner. If you are not a strong couple in the first place, this will SPLIT you up.   You are not a strong couple. Is it fair to bring a baby into a world where the parents are not together? No. You should consider what you can not give to this child and consider your options.   He is a cheater - meaning he doesnt want you.|`|v9cORzzfaa	Sounds like you got pregnant just to keep him... in which case, that is about the most sly thing you can do. I have had my ex do that to me before... I ended up taking custody after an expensive legal battle.    Karma is a b*tch|`|dXVA1wHDaa	If anhything, if you have a rocky relationship a baby will make it even worse.  After you have a baby, they are your number one priority, some men can't handle this.  You're under so much stress, doing night feeds, recovering from the birth, trying to budget your money to be able to afford everything your baby needs.  You need a supportive partner, not some a hole who cheats on you.    I was having a rocky patch when I fell pregnant, it wasn't planned.  We split up twice.  Once when I was 15 weeks pregnant, then again when my son was a month old, and this time it's for good.    Please don't have a baby to try and keep a relationship together, it doesn't work.|`|GuzQE5K6aa	if he cheated once and you went back to him  he'll do it again with the thoughts in his head that you'll always go back.    and no a baby just causes more arguments and problems due to the stress it brings.|`|R5LuKSUXaa	you are only 16 years old.  How are you going to SUPPORT a child?  do you know how much it costs?  doctors appointments, food,  diapers, clothing and more.  A baby will not fix anything.  I think it would put more strain on the relationship being how young you are.  You aren't going to be able to go out with your friends, hang out,  do anything a normal teenager would do.  Having a baby to keep a guy who obviously doesnt like you very much isnt a good idea (if he loved you he wouldnt have cheated)|`|vAQ9bdBeaa	a baby isn't going to change him. hate to break it to you =/|`|VnK7sTHKaa	No chance, once a cheat, always a cheat.

In thirty plus years of working with parents and families I have yet to see a rocky relationship improved by the addition of a new baby.|`|JbXUtNYvaa	trust me when i say that babies never fix problems in relationships.. they usually make them work.. while i want you and him to be happy together with the kid i strongly wouldnt recommend getting your hopes up. remember that the kid would be way more important than any guy who would makeout with someone else. honestly i think has some growing up to do even if he is your soul mate either that or find someone else who treats you right|`|2v8FSsiaaa	Look listen very carefully: A BABY WILL NOT FIX ANYTHING. A baby will probably end up having him resent you; did you ever think about that? He may blame you for "ruining" his life. You'll be the mother of his child in his eyes and he'll get some side action from other women. A guy cheats not because of you but because of himself; he'll never be satisfied with just you or a child. Bottom line: He will continue to cheat; a baby is not a band-aid. You can't bring in a child into this world for your own selfish reasons. Btw why aren't you protecting yourself from pregnancies or STDs? Look I'm a college student so I'm not some old woman preaching but do you seriously want to raise a kid at 16? You don't even know what your life is capable of being yet.|`|BoR3TSNHaa	Your BOYFRIEND is a HOODRAT! And, It's BEYOND SELFISH of you to plan to USE an innocent child to try to fix a relationship (if you can call it that) with a scumbag who cheats on you. HE DID MORE than kiss those 2 girls and you need to WAKE UP and get away from him.    And DON"T BREED until you're happily married to a FAITHFUL husband who will give your children a SECURE upbringing. If you are pregnant, You'd better LOVE that child ENOUGH to raise him/her without that LOSER ex of yours. And DON'T take out your anger from this failed relationship on the baby. If you are the kind of person who is MORE interested in THAT GUY than the Child, you need to consider adoption or abortion.    SOULMATES DON'T PLAY HEADGAMES WITH EACHOTHER, and this idiot you speak of is NOT even a WORTHY distraction from your TRUE SOULMATE.     I'm sure you'd like to believe he's your life partner, but as soon as you tell him you're pregnant he might play daddy for a little while, untill some chick with a better chest comes along, and then he'll be gone and that poor child will suffer for the stupidity of both of you.     Questions like this make me SICK!|`|J6IOqzL0aa	you are the reason why many 16 year olds are told they are immature and have no clue about life. I mean is this really serious. He cheats on you, tells you he doesnt want a relationship yet you still sleep with him and then think being pregnant will cure all. You are in for the shock of your life if you are pregnant and keep it. Babies are not dolls you can not turn them off when you are tired.|`|eVmQGDHQaa	Are you flipping crazy you have no idea how hard being a mother is and how on earth do you expect to raise a child when you are still a child you should be concentrating on your future not some boy you still have no idea of what love really is and if you think that a baby is going to fix your relationship you are very much mistaken do not ruin your life wait until you have met the right guy and make sure that you are able to support your child they are so precious and they deserve better than living a life of hardship. And just so that you know I am 25 years old and have a 7 month old daughter that was not planned and my boyfriend of 4 years left me because he was not ready to be a father all I can say is that thank goodness I have a degree and a good job because when I was your age I was looking to securing my future and although my child was not planned I can provide the best for her and let me tell you it is hard when the cry all night and you have to work in the morning its hard work so dont think that its all gonna be great.    You need to grow up and realise that you are only 16 there are so many wonderfull things in this world and babies can wait.
Loe0zgMOaa	mine was sore nipples,period like cramps, fatigue, and I just knew it the first day my period didn't come. I am now 5 weeks and 3 days. Went to E.R. yesterday because I started bleeding heavy and had a possible miscarriage. Wont know until tomorrow when my HCG levels are checked.<br>  <br>  My advice it to just let it happen and don't stress yourself out. Keep a journal, And if you think you may be, change your diet immediately and take over the counter prenatal vitamins. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|9qf2HSGYaa	Swollen breast and flu like sickness, this started about 2 weeks before my period was suppose to start.

Feeling very hungry then the urge to throw up half way through and If the smell of certain things like cleaners or certain foods trigger the nausea. It DOES NOT have to be just in the morning. Cramping could be a sign of your period coming around or an early miscarriage. They are more common than most women realize. Feeling unusually tierd. This may be a sign of low iron. If you are pregnant be sure to tell your doctor about that.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I got signs before I missed my period.

5805bf3a9bb2e4808ef2d73593aaab11aa	My husband and I got pregnant using something called the Billings Ovulation Method. The website is www.woomb.org. It seems a little bit complicated but when it comes down to it, all you have to do is pay attention to your cervical mucus everyday and wait for your body to tell you when you're ovulating. There should be one day (if you're ovulating) when your cervical mucus is clear and slippery like egg yoke. That is the day you're ovulating. You should try that day and the three days following. There's a lot more to it if you want to chart and find patterns and such, but that's the basic. If you're getting off of some kind of chemical contraceptive (as I did in June) it may take a few months for your body to get it out of your system. Keep in mind, everyone is different. Just check out the website and read all you can. It may take some time to figure out, but this method is real and it works. I'm 17 weeks along now. I really do hope this helps you. Best of Luck!|`|gwuTKiNXaa	try a herbal tea called herb lore that may help you

Hu9yquP4aa	If you can afford them, who would bash you? I can only afford two. As long as I am not paying for your family.     WHY WOULD I CARE how many kids you have?????|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	because people feel they have a right to tell others what they think, as if it matters.  they feel they have a right to judge other parents on how many children they are having..    some assume that just because a couple want to have many children, they must be on welfare, having NO IDEA what there income is..they just jump to them being on welfare..     people are sad..|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I'll agree that if you can afford for and properly care for tons of kids then have a many as you like... the Duggars for instance..     But for the woman from California...I have heard many different things, but the most consistent is that she's single, unemployed and living in a 2 bedroom house with her parents and now 14 kids... if that is true then it's wrong... and if it's false and she's employed, married and living with her parents for a short time and can afford 14 kids with no assistance then I have no issues in this.     Have as many kids as you like as long as you can afford it and care for the kids well.|`|Ar6wD9Oeaa	OMG i love this. I really really love this.  My husband and I want a large family, but at the time we can not afford a family of 20, because we are already income limited (on food stamps -sorry) but thats it..    Once My husband finishes school and gets a better job, hopefully we can continue on having children. I'd love to have 10-12. He would love to have as many as humanly possible. We have two right now.    I just really like the part you emphasize about "you do not have to be a doctor or lawyer or rich to raise a big household." because everytime my  husband and I talk about having more children, you A.) only hear the financial aspect of it and B.) hear "children are sooo exspensive.  I'm so tired of that. They are as exspensive as you make them. And they dont neeed marterial items and money to make them a good person. Love and care is what matters most.|`|YyX0EJDRaa	I think one is entitled to have as many kids as they like as long as they can take care of these kids and provide for them adequately. The mother's health must also be put into consideration because child bearing also takes a toll on one's health.

At the end of the day I have come to the conclusion that it depends on the quality of life you want to give for your kids. It is so easy to give your 20 children food and clothing homeschooling and love when u live a very frugal life. For me I want my children to travel the world and I want to able to send them to college and to give them the finer things of life. I totally agree that children are a heritage from the Lord and the Lord has also given us the power of choice. I have chosen that 2 or 3 children are enough for me and that I will not become a slave to the home but rather travel and contribute to society- such sharing my love with motherless children or becoming a mentor.

SnTuaKcJaa	I myself have spina bifida. Mine is a pretty bad case. I have no feeling from about chest down and I am in a wheelchair. I was born with no feeling from hips down though. Long story on that issue. I lead a perfectly normal life. I go to college. I work. I drive. I have great friends. Doctors have no clue what will happen to your child until it is born. They will and do tell you the worst case scenario if of course you little one does have sb. Don't let it get you down. Your little one will have an awesome life with or without it.|`|1f7454e7b81f8ce36a73c7aca09a8c24aa	Yes it is a serious condition but I know someone age about 30 who has it and they are really happy and lead a really cool, fun life.

Just to let you know it's usually inconclusive.     My mother was told with me and my brother that we were high risk for downs syndrome and spina bifida, of course it didn't matter to her or my father if we had a disability so they kept us and we turned out fine!     Might be the same for you, of course the child could be happy! Would you like to have been aborted because you had a disability that might not even be severe?|`|75zggy81aa	i work with children with disabilities and you need to ask yourself if YOU are ready for that life. Not just your child. Disabilities are expensive and very much time consuming- do you have the finances, patience, experience, knowledge, and understanding it takes to raise such a child? Are you ready to take care of that child for YOUR entire life if they are unable to get a job or move out or start a family of their own? Are you ready to risk your marriage knowing the stats show you are more likely to divorce if you have a special needs child. it really is a big decision to make, only you can know what you can handle. I personally couldn't because i work with special needs children 30 hours a week and that's enough for me, but if you can if you are ready for that then good for you. dint let anyone put you down if you decide to abort- this is your life and it will only affect your life no one elses. Good luck. Will an amnio give you a for sure result?|`|rqOIqO7Raa	I am so sorry. I went through this same thing with my daughter (she was my first baby) and I was told the same thing. But after she was born and went through multiple MRI's they concluded she did not have spinal bifida and that it was just a deep pit in her bottom of her butt. We had to do MRI's for the first 3 years to make sure nothing was going on that they missed. She is 5 now and happy and healthy and doing just great. You can't always believe what the doctors say. Be prepared to deal with it if it is there, but also you may find light at the end of the tunnel. I would get a second opinions before you decide to end your baby's life. This is HUGE decision and you need to get all the facts first. Best of luck to you, please keep us posted if at all possible.|`|Coc593Ikaa	Since you are on the fence with this decision, I advise you to arm yourself with more information. "Possibilities" are more terrifying than the truth. With a poor screening result, you should go ahead and research getting an amnio to tell you more about the baby's health. Then you will know what you are dealing with. And with that knowledge, you can make an educated choice. Also, research the condition so that you know what you may have to deal with. Spina bifida varies in severity, so you'll want to ask your doctor what your child will be dealing with. The only way to decide what to do and feel solid in your choice it to be well informed.     And, FYI, the group here is rabidly pro-life. I've been on here for quite some time and have read answers to lots of questions that bring abortion into the mix. So just take what is said with a grain of salt, okay?    Do make sure that you know what your diagnosis is before you act. Get another opinion. Get more testing.    ADD: Lindsay brings up excellent points. It is easy for others to tell you that having a disabled child is a blessing. But YOU are the one who will have to take care of all of its needs. I confronted all of these worries when my DS screenings came back poorly. You have to realize that if the baby does have a severe version, your life (all of it) will be devoted to it. You may have to spend your twilight years still taking care of your child's basic needs. And who takes over when you are gone? Your other children? Is that fair to them? How will they be affected. The list goes on and on. This is why you need to do some serious research into this to know what you are getting yourself into and then cross-reference that with what you can handle. I'll get thumbs-downed a lot for this, but this is reality. You can't ignore the ugly side.|`|uGFzzLYWaa	Could possibly? That's why I hate those damn tests, I absolutely refused them when I was pregnant with my daughter. I was scared enough being pregnant, and I didn't need that extra stress and worry. The only thing I cared about was that the baby had a brain, and it was inside of her head. Therefore, by not taking those tests, I had made the decision to accept my child the way that the universe chose to give her to me.     I would not make a decision to abort being 4 months pregnant and on a "could possibly have." The pregnancy would just be too far along for me to consider an abortion.     Spina Bifida can be really manageable and the children afflicted with it can have an awesome quality of life, and it can be absolutely tragic. I have read about both. But the doctor didn't say "definitely." It was "possibly." BIG difference.    Look inside yourself and trust your instincts. What do you think, and how do you feel? Do YOU feel anything is wrong? This decision needs to be made with your heart and soul, not based on a potentially inaccurate test.     Get a definitive yes or no before deciding. Amnio?     Good luck, honey.|`|7DOiQNjYaa	My husbands cousin has spina bifida, she is 35 years old married with 2 children.

I have worked with handicaped kids (mentally and physically) and I know that regardless of their disablity they all have a personality. Yes there are terrible days with biting and spitting, but there are wonderful days where they can change your life.    I belive that for me the choice is clear, but everyone is different.

Spina bifida can be severe, but it can be extremely minor and correctible too. These kids aren't mentally deficient in any way, either.    Some kids with very mild spina bifida- and adults- don't even know they have it. (There are many different kinds of spina bifida.)     And as you said, the doctor wasn't even certain. Whatever happens, I'm sure your child will be beautiful, smart and loving. And that you will be a great mum.    Hugs and you'll be in my prayers :)|`|ehvzQRkkaa	They absolutely can!

But you'll get very different opinions from everyone.  My brother and I have are total opposites and we're family.  He'd say he wouldn't want his child to suffer.  I'd say I'd want my kid to have a chance.    My sil worked with a girl who's 1st baby was definitely going to have downs syndrome.  They knew early on and were given the oppurtuniey to abort.  They didn't and when she had him, he was perfectly fine.  No d/s or anything.      Ultimately it is your decision and you should do what is right for you.  Good luck.  I hope everything is ok.    Also, I just wanted to say that my brother is almost 40 and in a cance exam and x-ray from a chiropractor, they told him that he has mild spina bifida.  Go figure.

My question won't show up.. Can u answer it?   http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|KQ66QfJTaa	Okay, I have a problem with someone pretending to be something they're not. But that goes way too far! I mean, come on! I would hate my mom to do that, it is terrible!    You have some problems.    You just need to talk to her, if you were a real parent, you would have talked to her about sex, masturbation, protected, unprotected, premarital, EVERYTHING!! You also wouldn't stoop to THAT level. It sickens me.|`|0312a1d62eaa8fa2204424ff52a59173aa	Before I answer I want you to know that you were very wrong to do that to her regardless of what she told. You should have talked to her in person. At this point I guess you can tell her mother that you think its time to take her to the doctor.I think it would be wrong to rat her out to her mom after all you were wrong too, but let your wife know she is getting to that age. Inform her of the dangers of having sex and get her some birth control. The sex talk should have happened a long time ago, kids these days start having sex at 10! Sounds crazy but true. And a lot of them think oral sex is not as dangerous as intercourse.|`|abxIVvhxaa	Okay..Breathe.     1.)  It's very very possible that she was just showing off to whoever she thought you were and hasn't actually done the deed    2.) Even if she went into detail it could just be what she's heard from friends who've had sex or movies... Trust me. Kids today know WAY more than parents give them credit for!    3.)  Do not, under any circumstances confront her in front of her mother. She'll feel embarrassed, betrayed, and pissed off if you do that.  I recommend not telling her mother until you're SURE that this has happened.    4.)  Break up with her?  That would save her from embarrassment from friends @ least but... It's not very important    5.)  This has NOTHING to do with her school, principal, and education. It doesn't matter if the students are sleeping around as long as it's not during class. This will cause mortification, 5 thousand I hate you's, and a huge wdge in your relationship.    6.) By the way... Are you telling me you waited until you were married to her dad to have sex with guys you've dated previously? Didn't think so.... :-)      Overall, just talk to her alone. Yes. she'll still be humiliated, angry, and betrayed but not as much as she would be if you talked to her publicly. If she is having sex you can't stop her no matter how long you ground her. Just try your damndest to keep her safe from AIDS, STDS, and whatever else is lurking out there.     Hope I helped...|`|NoLt3X5faa	OMG! you are the stupidest person ever. 1. shes not even your daughter you have no right to do that. 2. she is probably lying. 3. if shes not then give her the sex talk and ask her if she has anything to tell you or any questions. if not well that's all you can do there is a 99% chance that she is lying though most girls say that to sound older and sexier.  so i ca     P.S.

mxixfE3Raa	Because you're not going to get a normal period or anything so you cant wait for that, you need to test atleast 19 days from when you think the conception may have been.  If it's negative and you still think you're pregnant, you should wait atleast 3 days and test again.  And yeah, the cramps are usually the earliest sign, and start after about 10 days.   Good Luck|`|AA12041870	I can't imagine having kids less than a year apart.  Your boyfriend was so wrong to not leave you alone for at least 6 weeks.  Men can be so selfish.  Take a test when you want to.  You have that option.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	well, you need to read the insert with the pill. It tells you to use a back up method for at least 1 full cycle. That is 30 days. If the condom broke, you can be pregnant.   Call your doctor and get a pregnancy test.|`|7gLX624Gaa	It is about 2 weeks after intercourse that you can test for a possible pregnancy. If you get a negative I suggest you wait a week and test again just in case your levels were too low.  Good luck and I hope this helped|`|b5lzqQEBaa	Since you don't know when your period will start. The only way to get an accurate test result would be to take one everyday ( which would be costly Lol) or you can call your doctor and have a blood test done. Because you can get an accurate reading in blood even before it shows up on a urine test.. Hope that helps..|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	to save ur money i would wait 2 weeks, i got pregnant on this pill too and i was breastfeedin. so u never know. good luck and hope it goes the way u want it to
RcHO6d3Eaa	I wouldn't try too hard to lose weight just now - your baby is still very young and you need to recover from giving birth/ feeding a baby all the time. Breastfeeding takes up lots of calories -- you'll probably find if you stop worrying, you lose quite a lot anyway.    Having said that: I agree keeping biscuits in the house is asking for them to be eaten (I know that's what I do), how about things that are still going to satisfy you but are a bit healthier - like oatcakes, maybe, or fruit (bananas? apples?).     Also, make sure you're drinking enough water - you get frantically thirsty when you're feeding, and I often mistake thirst for hunger.     For exercise, I'd keep it easy - your body is getting a lot of use right now - but how about going for slightly longer walks every day with your baby?    And: don't feel bad about the odd biscuit/ bit of cake. If you can't eat that stuff guilt-free when you're feeding a baby, when can you?|`|nrEwJt3Maa	eat healthy foods, keep sliced apples ina  container in the fridge, mandarin oranges, etc... you get the idea, fruits and veggies and lean meats, less carbs/sugar.    Good for you for wanting to get healthy, I ate whatever and I gained 25 extra pounds after my girl was born (breastfeeding too) for a grand total of 60 pounds....  and now I'm pregnant again|`|84eecd1a05ce02d2c2c9fb77423f6e95aa	Stock up on fruits and vegetables, and eat all of those you want.  Buy lean meats like chicken or turkey -- check labels!  And all breads or cereals you eat should be high-fiber.  Look for whole-grain.  Stay away from refined sugar and flour, which those biscuits you're eating are full of.  Don't even bring them into the house.  If they are not there, you won't eat them.      Good luck!      P.S. Try quick half-hour walks once or twice a day!|`|vI0WnAiOaa	dont cut down on food while breastfeeding as you need all the calories you can get. ate lots of healthy foods more often and you should be right. some gentle exercise is good too, pop baby in the pram and go for a brisk walk a couple of times a day. good for you and baby too.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Weightwatchers worked for me after my pregnancy.
rTACLd3Saa	Since you asked "How" and not everyone's opinion of the idea, I will give you what I know and hold off on what I think of Baby Modeling in general.  <br>  <br>  The first thing you need to do is find a reputable agent.  You should never be asked to shell out money up front.  A reputable agency will see the potential in your baby and expect to make money off real bookings, not off you.  That being said, baby modeling is a tough, cut throat world.  You will have to be available 100% of the time for auditions and that means A LOT of driving unless you live right in a major city like NYC, SF or LA.  All that travelling can be rough on baby.  Also, the agents are not only looking for a cute baby.  THere are a million beautiful babies in the world.  THey are looking for the entire package.  The baby has to be really easy going and not irritated by overstimulation, easy to smile and laugh, outgoing, friendly, etc.  It's even more difficult to get started with a newborn because they don't have any real personality yet - you may see some but the average person won't.  In most cases you really have to know someone in the business or have a really good agent.  You can also post your baby's pic in contest websites or in local beauty pageant kind of things for exposure.  There are always talent scouts at those places.  There is a wesite called www.cutebaby.com that pops up everywhere and is endorsed by all kinds of reputable companies.  They do monthly cmpetitions and also different companies scout their site for babies and children.  <br>  <br>  Hopefully this information will help you.  Good luck to you and to your baby!  Cheers!|`|2ieiGIhTaa	please don't<br>  <br>  there are enough creepy insane stage parents out there already.|`|tecPZUq2aa	I Was Modeled As A Baby.<br>  <br>  Get Some Professional Photos ( Or Normal Ones It Doesn't Really Matter)<br>  <br>  The Look Up Some Modeling Agencies Online And end Your Potos In With Your Phone Number!<br>  <br>  <br>  Easy =]<br>  <br>  Good Luck X<br>  And I Don't Know Why People Are Being Horrible!

It's a life choice, don't be so judgmental. She didn't say "pageant". There are agencies out there specifically for kids and you can make an appointment to see if your baby has that look they're looking for (I've only worked with adult models for catalogs). I think if you have a photogenic baby and feel inclined to pursue it, then do it.|`|vuRejUo3aa	You got your baby just few weeks before, right? PLEASE, do not think of all those "modeling" right now.

F9pAWBG9aa	yes. b/c pills can mess with your period for a short while once you begin them but it should even out and stop happening soon
oM1uzuSdaa	Is this your first baby? Congratulations! The birth of both my children were wonderful. The hospital staff were great and supportive and I felt that they knew what they were doing. I had a midwife deliver both of my children (due to my insurance I had limited options of an OB/GYN that I could choose from and I wanted a female to deliver my children, she was one of two I could choose). For my first child I was in the hospital for 2 nights, 3 days. For my second I was in for 1 night, 2 days. My husband was with me for both deliveries, I delivered on a birthing bed and never had to leave my hospital room, and he was with me my whole stay (minus him getting something to eat and a shower). With my first I was soooo scared, I did not know what to expect, everyone was patient with me and I had both my children natural. Good luck and remember that your baby is coming out no matter what and in the end is the most beautiful, wonderful, human being that was ever created!|`|1bnhwGACaa	i had a great experience with both of my births   and my nurses were awesome   i cant wait to have this baby and have the same experience i had before   i was there for 4 days both times b/c of c-section and my hubby and the nurses got along great|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	I live in a small town so we have to drive about 40 minutes to a town with a population of about 10,000 to get to the hospital. It's a small, quaint hospital that has a newly renovated Women's Center, which is where L & D is located. I get my care from a family practice physician, she is my every doctor, she delivers my children and then becomes their doctor. I love her, she is a kind, understanding and intelligent doctor, I am very lucky to be one of her very few patients. I was glad to have found her as she comes when I am in labor, the hospital I go to has "on-call" physicians that deliver the babies, if your doctor isn't on-call when you go into labor then whoever is "on-call" oversees your labor and delivers the baby, but my doctor follows her own patients from the start of the pregnancy all the way through until th baby is born. Anyway...back to the hospital...the nurses at the hospital are excellent. They are compassionate, knowledgable and friendly. They took good care of me, my husband and our baby. They were always offering to bring my husband water, juice or ice cream treats while I was in labor. They were great to visiting friends and family also, making everyone feel welcome to come to visit. The birthing suites are newly renovated and feel very home-like and comfortable with a couch that pulls out into a bed for my husband to sleep on, a recliner for resting and beautiful wooden rocking chairs. It really isn't horrible staying there. Each suite has it's own private bathroom with a huge whirlpool tub, separate shower and of course, sink and toilet. I stayed the mandatory 24 hours after the birth of my children and then was discharged at my request. I wouldn't go anywhere else to deliver, I love it!|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	My hospital experience was incredible; the doctors and nurses were above and beyond in making me comfortable and answering ALL my questions.    My husband bunked in my room the entire stay (2 days), he had his own bed.  The nurses left him go to the food room and bring us snacks and drinks as needed. He was also allowed to order room service with me.     However, i know others that at the same hospital had horrible experiences. I think it's all in how you behave and expect to be treated.|`|b64219f408e63daa3f8c2cba4d84a232aa	Well im not pregnant butmy sister was.

All in all very great hospital  :]|`|AA11220327	with my oldest, I had a horrible hospital experience, we were treated badly, disrespected, ignored, you name it. So with my 2nd child i switched to the care of midwives and that was wonderful, I am now using the same midwives again for this pregnancy, and they are just wonderful, they actually care about their patients, unlike the OB I had with my 1st. I'm really not trying to scare you, but that was my experience|`|3gXQPso5aa	I received excellent care I was sent home twice before I got my induction so I guess because I acted up so bad they gave me the presidential suite LOL I was in the biggest hopital room I had ever seen it looked like an hotel.

evfYoiFoaa	it is horrible to tell a young girl that they have ruined their life and their baby's. i am 17 years old. i am due anyday now, i have EVERYTHING the baby needs and more. i worked my *** off. and i am doing fine even got to take leave when i got him everything. i got my GED last year in june and i'm starting college in may, my life nor my child's life is ruined. family and friends are the best support system, you could probably find a lot of help from them. fifteen year olds generally don't get hired at any place. but you could always find someone who needs a baby sitter or clean houses for someone. where i live you can also recycle aluminum cans and when you get a certain amount they will pay you for it. if you have clothes that you don't wear or things around the house you don't use.

fQ18TyyKaa	As a mother of a 2 year old and a 10 year old, a full time student, with a full time job, I can easily understand losing your temper with your child - HOWEVER, what I can not understand is how ANY person can injure a child. Discipline sessions? Is that some kind of joke written by some lawyer somewhere to reword a bad excuse for killing a child? It's chilling to think that there was actually a lawyer willing to sit in court with THAT WOMAN and attempt to defend her. Also, WTF could be so wrong with people that they put her body in a plastic tub and kept it for 2 months before they threw it in the bay? I used to live in Galveston and now every time I think if the beach, I am reminded of "Baby Grace". How could we have allowed the death penalty to be taken off the table as punishment for her mother and stepfather's crimes? Also, where is this child's father?|`|fPJTZwoUaa	what can u say  - its imcomprehensible to know whay someone animal ****  would do that to their own flesh and blood     - it just makes me soo sad and feel sooo sorry for that little baby -|`|JnLoHaoAaa	All I can say is it seems I'm hearing more and more stories like this.

I hope that woman never sees the light of day again|`|ZejwYamhaa	That really makes me cry as well. How can someone do that to anyone, let alone a 2 year old, let alone their own daughter. That is really really really horrible. I can't really explain how i feel about people like that, in a way i feel sorry for them, they should be locked up in a mental hospital and guarded 24hours a day.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	those kind of "parents" should be killed slowly like they did to that little angel.I'm so sad about it and it's a fact that if people cared a little bit more for each other things like that may would be avoided....so so sad :(((|`|99ML0m2yaa	That's horrible!  I practically cry if I accidently hurt my son...I can't imagine hurting him on purpose!  He is my life!  Her parents must be very sick and need lots of help or the death sentence.  I personally think the death sentence is a better choice!|`|JQZDCcyQaa	All i have to say is if that made you sad, then why the hell did you post it on a parenting forum where we are all parents. Thanks
Hu9yquP4aa	contractions are painful, but membrane sweep will cause some pain, If it radiates through your lower belly up or from your back to your pelvis, start timing them. They are most likely contractions.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	Once I had this done, I went home, and thought for sure I was in labor. I went back to the hospital and they assured me that I wasn't, and I wasn't.    I actually found these pains to be less tolerable than the contractions the I had experienced once actually in labor.
9c53EJskaa	It's up to you. If you want to list him on the birth certificate of the father he will need to be there to sign and say he agrees that he's the father. If you are going to get married and want the child to have your fiance's name (and your name if your going to change it after your married) then I'd just give the baby your fiance's name to start with.|`|F9pAWBG9aa	i had a problem similar to that and i decided that my baby will have my last name. but if you are going to get married and change your name soon i would suggest her having his last name =) congrats|`|t4HXotwEaa	You can give her any last name you like.  The last name does not determine paternity.|`|lfV7WgF9aa	It is up too you. It can be which ever you want it to be.<br>  Traditionally it would be her fathers name.|`|zBz10IiOaa	hun they give you a choice it is up to you and the hubby|`|7df573746dd6a85c2a8f383acdd3aefbaa	I say giving her, her dad's last name since it seems respectful because he is in Iraq right now. (:|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	His. My husband and I are not married ( but were common law ) and our son took his last name. And so will this baby. <br>  Its tradition and honor. Just as you will take his last name when you get married.|`|ku0wHQDiaa	Well, if your not married, it's really your choice.<br>  You can use your last name and DO NOT LIST father or,<br>  you can list the father and use his last name.<br>  <br>  Most times unless you are not with the father or do not see a future with him, you would give the child the fathers last name.|`|fHgbL046aa	You can chose what last name she has. That is what I did with my daughter.I've been with my partner for almost 18 years and we never got married. Our 16 year old has my boyfriends last name and so will the second child I am caring. I think its neat when you can use both last names to make a first and last name. His last name is Shane and my last name is Smiles. If we had a boy we can name his Shane Smiles. LOL I just know there are better first names out there. Good Luck in what ever you choose.|`|x8JRkRNkaa	You can give her either name. If you're getting married I'm sure you will want her to have his last name. You don't have to be married for her to get his name.|`|8b9e5894f70e3364d0f2490295d49b82aa	My daughter has both her father's and my last name.  We are not married or even together.  I live in the US and you can give you child whatever last name you want. <br>  <br>  Good luck!
nQ7ZcUI3aa	I love the name Naomi, I actually thought about using it myself until someone informed me that it says I moan backwards and I changed my mind. I like Naomi Jean though.|`|9X09kM4oaa	lynn  anne|`|AA10325228	Sorry but I don't like it.|`|AA11603468	Naomi makes me think of a 50 year old really earthy-crunchy granola type who wears ponchos and has long unstyled hair that's greying, but she'd never dye it-or wear makeup. Either that or one of those multpile wives in those Mormon compounds.    Just my opinion, of course.|`|1yb79zfEaa	Naomi Sahara  jeanette Naomi  Naomi Jinae  Fabiola Naomi  Naomi Violeta|`|NroZQN5vaa	I love Naomi. I wanted to name our daughter Naomi Carlene.

Naomi Leah  Naomi Giselle  Naomi Marilyn   Naomi Harlow  Naomi Grace  Naomi Anne  Naomi Jane  Naomi Thyme|`|Pz8rIt26aa	It's very bohemian, I like it.|`|VGij9p0Taa	Yes I like Naomi it's a good biblical name!  Stick with other traditional names to make a truly magnificent name traditional are great even though so are modern names however a traditional name will be very classy.   Middle names:-  Rose meaning a rose   Elizabeth meaning god is my vow   Ruth meaning friend   Isabelle meaning god's gift   Ava meaning bird   Jane meaning god gift of grace   Kate meaning pure maiden   Lillian meaning a lily   Evelyn meaning life   Helen meaning light  Hope I helped and good luck!|`|oVkeP1lvaa	Naomi Leone?
j3bE41RNaa	i say wait a few days and see where that gets you. Sometimes when you are stressed out or wanting something to happen.....thats when hormones go crazy and dont know what to do. So it might just be that you have been stressed so its going to take longer for your period to come.     But just wait a few more days....and be hopeful!|`|AQVoQbMEaa	yes wait u FREAK|`|r0BHJk6Yaa	hmm u soudn liek u could be preg..    so just test in a few more days|`|PyvLRYKGaa	stop having to much sex|`|4kX61Y97aa	i would wait a couple more days if your cycles are regular then this may be postive. i did a test when i thought i was but it was negative 2 weeks later i didnt have my period and went to the doctors where they confirmed i was 7 weeks pregnant. sometimes its jus the hormones     all the best for you in the future of TTC    *baby dust*|`|Hu9yquP4aa	You could just have lower hormone levels that a test wont pick up. Wait a few days, like 3, and try again. If still no period head to the doctors for a blood test. You will get a definite answer then.    Good luck!|`|uhj76Fkpaa	yup...wait a couple of days and test again
AA11920812	Read. Watch a movie. Create a craft, we go to a couple different websites to get some ideas. We just did a car wash. They brought all their cars in the kitchen, lined them up, and we used a bucket of water with a LITTLE bit of soapy water and cleaned them up. I bought some markers by Crayola that color on windows and designated a window for each of them. I also gave them windex and paper towels and my almost three year old cleaned the windows up after he was done. (Okay, not like I would but still I thought it was great he was helping clean up).    Our mall has a bounce house in the middle of it (Starbucks is there too) so we frequently take them there. There are other kids so they socialize. And, there is a basketball hoop in the middle of it. And, lots of balls. The bounce house has a slide. And, they charge for every 10 minutes, but if no one else is waiting you get a longer play time.    They always come home tuckered out! There is a carnival horse ride that they get to ride on that they love as well. And, another section for ride on toys. Another mall has a whole *store* that is just kid play stuff.    When worse comes to worse I take them to McDonalds. Let them play on the equipment there. Or, Chick Filet.    I like these craft ideas because they also teach a lesson  http://www.dltk-bible.com/  http://www.catholicmom.com/catholic_kids...    Do a search for a specific craft or craft genre. We took some tissue paper (colors) and glued to mason jars to create a pretty table scape. We did this for St. Martin de Porres feast day, but have used them for all special occassions since then.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	No, I feel like that in the hot summer. (I live in Phoenix) We hit the library, in-door park at the mall, and story time and Barns & Noble. I also make a calendar each week of a special activity for each day, whether it is an art or cooking project. We paint, do playdough, make collages etc. We bake cookies, muffins and make jello, pudding etc. I get the ideas from books I take out of the library. I also make sure we have at least one play date every week, social time for them, sanity for me.|`|iFmKcRl0aa	I feel your pain!     One thing that helps me (at least psychologically) when the weather is not quite so cold is to open the windows and freshen the air in our apartment for even a few minutes.     I try to make games out of everything for my son. We march and dance and get quite silly sometimes. We even dress up and race around the house pretending we're superheroes. (I've learned that winter entertainment means I must shed my pride.)    Here are a couple links I've used for ideas on keeping my son busy when the weather is bad.    http://www.findingdulcinea.com/news/heal...    http://www.findingdulcinea.com/features/...|`|YYLzML9gaa	yep. 2 month old|`|4gZYucHMaa	I used to feel like that when I wasn't getting any time to myself but now I make sure I get out for a run before my spouse leaves for work..which is 4 am at times but that way I'm not held back bc of weather and I'm in better energy for my kids.    I'm in a better mood and something like today when it's -26 celcius I can handle going out for a run but the kids are bundled inside the house..we do puzzles, build forts with blankets and chairs, play doh, and simple baking where one can pour and one can stir etc, also with Valentines coming up they can do crafts with either making their own hearts or having them bought and decorate a picture with them etc...possibilities are endless. Sometimes curling up on the couch with them and a good movie and popcorn works too|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	yes with a 2 and 4 year old its hard! You cant go outside, go to the park, go swimming! I always feel that we play with toys or watch tv!!|`|928d3c3f724692764257407068fe45d4aa	oh, yes!!! (3 1/2 year old). Try cooking with them and they can pretend to cook with vegetable peels. Puzzles, blocks, reading, play-dough, beads, trains, Candyland, etc. Hope this helps, and believe me we are all counting the days until spring!!!
AA10196172	Google "decidual bleeding". You can have what might look like periods for one or more months while pregnant. Your hormones haven't totally adjusted, and opart of the uterine wall still peels off on schedule, looking a bit like a period.    Try a home test. A false positive is extremely rare. Of course, if you don't make enough hGC (pregnancy) hormone, you could get a false negative from that, too.     The doctor's blood test is much more sensitive, if you really want to be sure.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Some women bleed during pregnancy, but it's not a period. If the flow was normal to heavy flow it was a period and you are not pregnant. Of course the only way to know for sure would be to test....|`|ZEP1K3oSaa	Wow that is just great, not, best of luck to you now...    Guy|`|qMK03pt9aa	hello i had periods three months into my first pregnncy xx|`|75zggy81aa	even if you have had periods and are pregnant, a test will still detect the pregnancy hormone. take a test and find out for sure.|`|Im4x06Qhaa	I agree with the others.... definitely take a few (2 or more) pregnancy tests, and if they do say positive get to the doctor. I'm pregnant now, and me and my guy kept having sex, but being pregnant means you have a lot of extra blood (down there)... so I would bleed sometimes red, then brownish blood. My doctor told me that we had to take it easy (LESS sex) and definitely have pelvic rest. Tell your doctor what's going on. Either you're still having ure period while pregnant (many woman do) or something's else is up. Either way the tests & doctor visit is a safe track.|`|TzLe0GEEaa	Some people continue to have periods while they are pregnant.  Take a test.|`|TCGLe8sdaa	it could be implantation bleeding so u could be pregnant but i could also be a sign of other things too... id say go to the docs|`|vXjZjUxzaa	i did the same thing sweetheart.  docter says its natural.|`|FAzua6k7aa	I had my period for 2 months into my first pregnancy, I was pregnant with twins =) =O  Get tested ASAP you need to make sure you get your pre-natal pregnancy vitamins.
AA10196172	Assuming this is serious and not a troll, since you just joined. The picture looks bad enough that it could be anything... The first thing I did was look to see if it looks like a guy trying to pull a troll post. The pants sure look like guy pants, except for the colour-coordinated belt and the belly button looks too high for a guy's beer belly.    Yes, if you have sex, you can get pregnant, whether you wanted to or not.    You'd be pushing at least 6 months by now. If you're not showing more, it's quite amazing. Most women already look like they swallowed a basketball at this point.    You can have what look like periods. Google "decidual bleeding". Some women have them all the way through. That's why sometimes you see on the news where a fat woman goes into the hospital for stomach pains, gives birth, and didn't even know she's pregnant.    It's not unusual for HPT tests to read negative when you are pregnant. They are not as sensitive to hGC (pregnancy) hormone as the doctor's blood test. Have the doctor do a test to find out for sure.    Hey, you gotta talk to the parents sooner or later, probably better now than while you're in labor or coming home from the hospital with a bundle of joy. It's not like you can avoid it forever. Who knows, they may even surprise you and be supportive.    There may not be much you can do about the ex, since it will be your word against his. Certainly, there can be paternity tests and he'll be paying child support...    Good luck.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You need to go to a doctor and tell your parents. Take another home pregnancy test....|`|Vjz5VeWaaa	if there is a dollar store near you or a grocery go buy a pregnancy test ... get the cheapest one if you dont have a lot of money.  That way you'll know for sure.  I would think if you had periods you would not be pregnant but you never know.  BUT if you are you've got to talk to someone ... aunt, cousin, friends mom?  you will eventually have to tell them sweetie if you are b/c you have to go to the doctor.  I knew a teenager in your shoes and when she finally did tell her parents they took her to the doctor and she was already ready to have the baby, it had been 9 mos and she had no idea with a small lil belly.  Now the baby is healthy and happy and her parents had to accept it!  You could always tell your mom you're been having period problems and want to go to the doctor ..... then she will make you an appt and you can go in and the doctor will be able to tell you yes or no instantly.|`|eGscNMTOaa	you need to talk to your parents or someone so you can see a doctor.|`|AA11220327	you NEED to see a doctor asap. If you are pregnant (which there is a good chance of) judging by the date you gave you would be about 7 months along by now, and have obviously had no prenatal care at all. Prenatal care is so very important from as soon as you think you are pregnant. Please get to a doctor.|`|6dhEB2nBaa	Ive had lots of friends that couldn't talk to their parents about sex and pregnancy, but you have to take into consideration that its not just you if you are pregnant. If you have a health department in your town they will do a pregnancy test without telling your parents. If your not pregnant then you can atleast find out what is wrong.|`|SPe2EcC0aa	You could be.. but you'd be 5 months pregnant at this point. Some people have a little bleeding through their ENTIRE pregnancy. I would go to Planned Parenthood (you can do this without your parents) and have them do a  pregnancy test and take it from there. Good luck :)
EeMzixByaa	My son also had this bug!  Bannanas are the best, the greener the better.  More of the stuff that will help bind him up.  My doctor told me a bland diet 4-5 days after the diareah so it doesn't come back.  Cheerios (dry) saltines graham crackers, pasta no sauce! only butter.  Trust me, it will get better.  keep pushing the clear liquids!|`|TBwepDiDaa	Try the B R A T diet  Bananas  rice  apple sauce   toast|`|3gDiRoNwaa	Bananas are good and give him pedialyte for drink it will keep him hydrated.They sell pedialyte in the grocery and the drug stores.|`|eeaXYyCNaa	I don't know if you are from the south or not. LOL but, we give grits.  They are easy on the tummy.  And most kids love grits.  Well, at least mine do.|`|GLnVPp2Caa	well, since it's been a few days, i would stick to the clear liquid diet.  applesauce is supposed to constipate normal babies, so it should thicken loose babies.    you don't want him to get dehydrated, so go for pedialyte or the gerber electrolyte product    skip juice, gatorade, sodas, etc because they have sugar in them and that aggrevates things.    it will pass.  when he's hungry, then you will know it's time for solids, but keep it really simple like toast. stay off the dairy for a while.    hugs to baby (and mom)
L4BFp2mNaa	maybe he needs a copy to bring to his work. if he has not posed a threat to kidnap no need to worry|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	ask him what he needs it for. there are very few things that you need the original. simply make a copy for him to have|`|9p9DDRSnaa	i would give him a copy...he has the right...same as you.|`|2cstdEkIaa	It depends if his name is on it or not. If it is he may try to claim her on taxes or prove paternity and get custody. if its not there, he may deny the child...or he may just want it for his records but if that was the case he could order his own copy|`|8abc539129667b9f70458872539d85f7aa	find out why he needs it, then make a photocopy of it. do not give him the original certificate.    as long as her social security number is not on the certificate,  i wouldn't worry.|`|0nIFyDk9aa	just make a copy of it and if he need the real one go with him to where he need it and give it to them you have the right to protect your children.it might be nothing but don't let your guard down .my husband had a child  from another lady and he does not need her birth certificate  just her ssi  for his taxes if he pay child's support then he can get some money back on his taxes if he is up to date.|`|90598bb3a99f9e4549dba2a1c20f8c4faa	If he is listed on the birth certificate as the father, he has every right to obtain a copy. However, you do not have to give him one that you purchased. Therefore, you should instruct him to obtain one himself from either vitalchek.com or from the local government where the birth occurred.

AA11967749	First of all let me say how sorry I am for your loss.I hope you have all the support you need.You can bleed up to six weeks even if you did not carry to term.a lot of books say a week to ten days and I do not know why.I myself went as long as six weeks once so I am living proof.I also miscarried and bled for about two weeks.Sometimes the bleeding can stop and start again,but if you notice that you are bleeding bright red blood or that you are soaking a pad every hour or more I would contact your doctor immediately or go to e.r.In your case it could be your period but I suggest you contact your M.D. just to make sure,anyways you should be seeing him/her in about two weeks for your six week check-up.Take care of yourself,good luck.|`|672c90d5dd07132c96a277cb5ab1cdfeaa	I'm sorry I'm not sending an answer but rather my condolences of your misfortune.|`|AA11791565	Wow! This brought me to tears. I couldn't imagine going through something like that. My heart sincerely goes to you.  Well, I think you would have to wait six weeks, you're on the 4th week, so I think 2 more weeks of bleeding. I guess period is included cause then you get regular again.      oh.. before I go, I hope you don't mind me praying for you, so God can give you the strength you need to go on...  and just think that where ever your baby is, its right next to God...  God Bless...|`|AA11621732	I am so sorry to hear of your loss.    check out this link    http://www.drspock.com/article/0,1510,52...    some good info    Take GOOD care of yourself|`|AA10625237	I'm sorry for your loss.    I had a pretty normal delivery and bled for 6 weeks.  A friend of mine said hers lasted 6 weeks as well.  Maybe you should talk to your dr or nurse about it.|`|AA10321198	The bleed from the delivery can last up to 10 days then you can start our normal period too.  I am sorry to hear that happen.|`|AA12185963	Its probably your period. When you have a baby you bleed any where from 1 to3 weeks from the birth, and then about another week for your period. On both of mine I bled about a month. I am sorry for your loss.
AA11432707	"Water" breaking is the amniotic sac breaking.  This is the membrane that keeps the baby floating in amniotic fluid, which looks a lot like water.    If your water breaks, it opens up the possibility for infection to travel into the uterus and infect the baby or the membranes around the baby (chorioamnionitis).  This can be very serious for both Mom and baby.    Sex just pushes bacteria closer to the baby, so no sex once the amniotic sac has broken.|`|AA11603761	It's the bag of amniotic fluid that surrounds the baby.  When it "breaks", thats the first sign that labor will shortly start.  Sex is not wise because of the high risk of infection.|`|AA12166394	when you water breaks you are in labor    nothing prevents sex during pregnancy    except dr.'s orders, if the pregnancy is high-risk or if you are put on bed rest|`|AA12083750	Water breakage usually happens in the last  hrs before delivery  most women are uncomfortable having sex the last few weeks before delivery and 4-6 weeks after ..but if the water breaks before it can mean that without medical supervision  any thing going up can get into the baby's eyes ears nose and throat|`|AA12365491	I'm not sure I understand your question completely but, at the end of a pregnancy when the water breaks, that means all the fluid that had been inside the sac with the baby has come out.  The membrane has ruptured and now the uterus can contract fully to help the mother push the baby out.  Now the reason it would prevent sex is sometimes,  the membrane can rupture to early, before it is time for the baby to come out and if you have sex that can induce labor.  Another reason not to have sex after the water has been broke, is now the protective barrier is open and you could cause bacteria to be pushed up there, causing infection. You do not want that!

If you don't understand what they say then perhaps you are not ready for the answer.    If you are savvy you could look up the word intercourse. Don't do it on the web because all you'll get out of that is confusion. Besides your parents may have parental controls on your computer and that will prevent you from getting your answer.    The penis is a delivery system (like a pitcher in baseball) for sperm which are produced in the testes of the man and the vagina is the receptacle (like the catcher).|`|AA11395637	Go and ask your parents|`|AA11145256	ask your parents|`|1f83174c4a45d537f7f5e47bccc6626daa	Each other.Man puts a condom on and female takes birth control pill then if they are married, the man inserts his penis into the women's vagina, and thrusts in and out.

AA11871343	It is possible to have a period and be pregnant at the same time. However, with your tubes tied and all that...it's unlikely that you are. The movement you feel could be gas rumblings in your intestines. I'm sure you've heard of people who lose a limb can sometimes "feel" it still. I think that's what you many be experiencing. I KNOW that I am not pregnant, but once in awhile I "feel" that same type of feeling like when I was pregnant and the baby moved. I wouldn't worry too much..I highly doubt you're pregnant if you got your tubes tied. Just to be sure, take a pregnancy test and call your doctor. Good luck.|`|7ff11e2988c5908a75da2469daf0bce4aa	You shouldn't be but if it is meant to be nothing is going to stop it I supose. As far a movement I am on  4 and I felt him move at like 13 weeks or so it was small small flutters but I knew it was him. I am 22 weeks now and man he can not sit still. So I would see the doc cause alot of people have periods the whole 9 months.|`|AA10686104	you can have your period while pregnant. i don't know about clipped and burnt, but one of my good friends had her tubes tied...got pregnant, had the baby, got them tied again, got pregnant again. as for the movement, it should be about the same month you felt it with your others, if you are pregnant. get checked soon! Hope it works out the way you want it to.|`|76eb2239a10d4c0fb8893e6239145fffaa	If you've had your tubes tied, and you suspect pregnancy I'd go see a doctor.  Something serious may be wrong.      To answer the question about movement, they say with 2nd..3rd..etc pregnancies you can feel movement a bit sooner than as with a first pregnancy because you know what it feels like. With a first pregnancy you can often think it's gas when it's really the baby moving.
AA10686104	well, normally, you don't plan your own shower. this is something that friends or family should be doing for you, as planning it yourself would be like going up to people and saying 'buy me something.' I am sure you have a lot of things you really need, especially with twins coming, but the most you can really do towards getting people to buy it for you is to register somewhere like walmart, target, baby depot, babiesrus, or somewhere that sells baby things, and then if someone asks if you are registered, you can say, why yes, i am, at .... registering is nice in someways, because it lets people see what you need without having to ask you a million questions...you get to pick things you want and list them...if you do this, i suggest you be realistic and practical, and put lots of different priced items on the list..many people would love to get you something, but may not have much money...and don't be suprised if they get you stuff 'similar to' but not exactly what you listed on the registry, because these are really just guidelines and no one is obligated to get only from the list...as they aren't obligated to buy anything at all. I hope some one is planning a wonderful shower for you, as every mother and child should have one, but you might want to look into those baby resale shops if not...ok, they resell the baby items, not the babies, haha...sometimes you can get brand new stuff for very small amounts. good luck! also, i think you can register at a lot of places by going to the store websites...where you can also look at things they have for sale...though looking online isn't as fun as picking up and cuddling all the cute stuff in the stores!|`|361ec5a6d4116d7a4b3177dc0c7696d0aa	when my girl got pregnant, her friends and her female relative planned one. I'm not sure how it works for a mother to be if she wanted a baby shower for herself.|`|AA10519974	you dont plan it and your friends and family throw one for you not you. sorry wait and see who throws one for you i have not planned mine cause im waiting to see who will throw one for me and im 28 wks prego with my second good luck|`|AA11839888	usually a group of friends, coworkers, family or church group will decide to throw you a shower. drop hints that you want a shower soon.  you can register at walmart and put a list of things you need in the computer and then anyone you knows you are registerd can look you up by name.  you will need to decide on a date and who you want to invite, get some invitations and send them out, most showers have a baby themed cake, so someone will have to order that , you will have butter mints and mixed nuts in bowls, punch of some sort, finger sandwiches like chicken salad or pimento cheese, chocolate thin mints, sausage balls etc.  cheese platter, luncheon meats plates, veggie tray.  plates, napkins, glasses, eating utinsels, table clothes.  a basket with little rolled up thankyoufor coming  notes in them, colored paper tied with ribbon can be given to those that bring in the gift that day.  a table for the gifts to go on, decorations, like ballons or paper banners.  you should have a note book, so that you can have a friend write down the name of who bought the gift, what the gift is and the persons adress if needed to send out thank you notes.|`|e9947ab48b3508301cd94a77fec9c136aa	i think u should get a cake and tell all of u're friends and all of his friends that it is going on i also think that u should get some balloons,chips,cookies,presentsfrom friends,bottles from friends and probably u're husband,and more.|`|4cf94bd149e232169e6e67b9105e397aaa	Usually your friends and family plan one for you, but if they don't I guess your first step would be to register at the stores you would like stuff from, I wouldn't get too out of hand and list a bunch of expensive items.  As far as the shower goes you usually serve some kind of sandwiches and stuff like that, play some games, you might be able to look up a few on the internet...oh yeah send invites....
AA10991324	they start counting your 40 weeks of pregnancy the first day of your last period so that would make your due date april 27th for more pregnancy information you should check out parentcenter.com it is a really good site|`|a110d17d2efa9551adeba5b30532c00eaa	Dating a pregnancy can cause confusion, because it can be done in either of two different ways. Pregnancy can be dated from the first day of the last menstrual period or it can be dated from the day of ovulation.    In the United States, pregnancy is dated from the first day of the last menstrual period. This is a holdover from a time when much less was understood about conception. No one understood that ovulation was required for conception or when ovulation occurred. However, most women know when their last menstrual period was and it was known that the average pregnancy lasts 280 days (40 weeks) from the first day of the last menstrual period. According to this system, conception doesnt actually occur until 2 weeks of pregnancy. Obviously, you arent pregnant until conception occurs. This is just an artifact of the old system.    In many other places, the new knowledge has been incorporated into a dating system that starts with conception. In that system, pregnancy starts on the day of ovulation (usually the day of conception) and lasts for 266 days (38 weeks).    http://www.askdramy.com/dating.html  Everything is esimated. When i put in that date in your other question the conception date could be 3 days off cause sperm can live inside you for up to 7 days so just say you had sex today you might not get pregnant until 5 days from now.|`|AA12345516	Alot of things determine when your due date is, the inital due date is calculated by the date of your last period but once you have an ultrasound that date may change, my due date changed with each ultrasound (I had twins so I had numerous ultrasounds) they take the babys growth into consideration during ultrasounds when calculating the due dates.

The brat diet halp with the heartburn if you stick to it a few hours before bedtime (brat diet = bananas, rice, applesauce, toast). It's not much, but I hope this helps you.
d3738eb514750f43107214065eba5810aa	My daughter gets timeout in her room.  Yes, it works  :)|`|0qP8gLpyaa	Time outs work, but it really depends on the child. Some kids it is effective because they don't like being sat apart from the activity and made to just sit when they do something wrong. Other kids just think they are funny and it is ineffective completely.  Time outs, contrary to Super Nanny, are NOT cure alls and one size fits all discipline.  For toddlers they usually work and through preschool age. When kids get older they become ineffective as a cure all discipline.  There are some kids though that just a stern look and "no" from a parent or care giver sends them into tears from the disapproval and others who you practically have to throttle to get it through their head that they are doing something wrong and to stop.  Whether it is spanking, time out, removing privileges or other methods there is no "one size fits all" cure to childhood behavior issues.  The only thing that is (and should be) consistent in any method is to not do it in anger and to be sure your child knows WHY they are in trouble. With toddlers and little one's you have to sound like a broken record to them so they understand why it's bad when they try to pull a lamp off the table or  climb on top of grandma's china cabinet or even why they can't run after their ball into the street.  Consistency, patience and firmness are what make any method effective.|`|AA11327878	it all depends on the child.  a spanking does not work for my boys.  it was like a never ending thing.  i started using the time out thing. that worked so much better.  i would put them in their rooms. if i put them on the stairs or on the couch they would constantly get up or whine and cry and try to get what they wanted.  easy to do when they are getting on your nerves. (don't mean that in a bad way) |`|ErCJnABBaa	It works for some children.    After all, disciplining a child is basically providing concequences to their actions (usually in the form of negative concequences for bad behavior).  Generally speaking, a time out is NOT fun, and therefore a form of negative concequence.  However, some children see time outs in better or worst light than others.    In other words, you have to find what works for your child.|`|5xmyhFshaa	I tend to offer both depending on what the circumstances are. My son is now seven years old and I let him choose his form of discipline and most of the time he would prefer a spanking (I know weird huh). But I have found that the older he is getting the more taking things from him such as spending the night at grandparent's on the weekend, and playing video games just ruins his world. And he seems to grasp the concept better than if I were to spank him. So it really depends on you, the child and the circumstances I believe. "Spare the rod Spoil the Child"!|`|kdu80NXzaa	Short term there is no difference, long term time out increases the individuals self esteem, benefits their ability to form positive relationships and deal with anger.  Yes and No  I have used it with children aged 2-15 who were emotionally and behaviourally disturbed, had a range of special needs as well as other school children and my own children. In all cases it decreased the problem behaviour and made my job calm and pleasant.  |`|220b695ab00eca1c536e15d2f68abdd5aa	Time outs can work when used appropriately.  One doesn't always work 'better' than the other.  You have to use whatever is appropriate for the situation.  I didn't get 'time out' as a child.  Once I was a teenager I got sent to my room, I was 'too big' for a spanking.  As an adult, I use time outs and spanking to discipline my children.|`|hKYU7yxAaa	I think it depends on how old the child is, if a child that is older a time out would be great, I have a 2 year old and time out doesn't work......well she gets a time out from her toys or the show she is watching. If she is playing in her play room I close the dorr and tell her you can't go back for ten minutes and sit down and talk to her about what she did and why she shouldn't do it. I don't spank but my mom did with my brother and she didn't find it helped, but now as an adult he hasn't had any problems with it.|`|c4f3vioXaa	i give my child a spanking not to hurt him and timeouts works. places for my kids timeouts is on the steps, in his room, or in the corner|`|80578b521ef7675f058613b674088db7aa	sometimes. Theres' also natural consequences. Like if he spills something, make him clean it up.  I never got time outs- that a new thing.  I don't like time outs- so much screaming and carrying on. Spankings can be the same way and don't always work.

sgMno1PRaa	I dont know if this is right, but some children can fall asleep when on drives cant they? I thought I knew someone who took their child for a drive to get them sleepy and then they would fall alseep straight away once getting in|`|nCbtZAIoaa	Usually the best method for naps - you do need to do it for 1 nap per day for 2-3 weeks to see a good result, so if you haven't been doing it for this length of time you need to keep going.     The other other option is to rock him off in his pram to begin with. When he wakes after 40 minutes, rock him a little to get him back to sleep. Once he can this consistently, you can try him in the cot again.|`|RcHO6d3Eaa	We took ours for walks in the sling when he went through non-napping phases. We always followed the same (boring) route and he was normally asleep by the time we'd walked for 5 minutes.

I wanted my daughter to be more used to a little time alone each day and not just sleeping. So when she cried I just left her, and when she got over tired I would go in, lay her down, stroke her face and walk away, with a cd on in the backround.  Then if she got out of control crying, then I would go in, lay her down, NOT SPEAK TO HER, but gently ssshhhhhhh her. Then leave the room again. I would do this every 5 mins for the time I wanted her to be in bed, say 1-2pm. Then when time was up I would go in and say Time to get up now. Like I did in the morning, Time to get up now!  This allowed her to know that this was different now, open the curtains and get her up.  It took about 3 to 4 days to change her pattern and it takes 3-4 days to change any child's behaviour at that age.  So just shhhhhh her and lay her down. She will get it eventually and your not being mean by wanting her to sleep and letting her cry. Kids are strong willed and more so than we are as adults. You need to find your strong will now, or she will know she can own you!!....lol   Also she may just be a child who wants that 15 mins and no more.  Good luck.|`|0VHolTVEaa	My son was the same, he used to sleep for max 15-20 minutes power naps and used to be active. Give him milk in the afternoon and play some soft music. If that doesnt work take her for a walk, this always seems to work as babies fall asleep with movement. Its good for you as its fresh air and excercise and good for the baby, she will eventually dose off is she is really tired. Good luck|`|iMaTMWMxaa	You could go for a walk with her.

AVzQs5Uhaa	most likely you will not become pregnant because you took  it with in 24 hrs, though there is still a change try not to worry about it as much if you are being more active then normal that  is probably why you are eating more. Also I would maybe recommend going on something like the pill or the patch or an iud  , so if this situation happens again at least you are doubly protected if you get what i mean. It will give you protection against getting pregnat and using a condom will give you protection against pregnancy and std/sti<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.go2planb.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.go2planb.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rxlist.com/plan-b-drug.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rxlist.com/plan-b-drug.htm</a>|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Plan b only stop an fertilize egg to attached to a wall<br>  If an fertilize egg was already attached to the wall, plan b will do nothing<br>  Plan b does not stop pregnancy, if already happened<br>  Plan b will only stop pregnancy from happening<br>  <br>  If you are more than a week late take a test<br>  You should give yourself at least a week, plan b can make a period late<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Nothing is foolproof, even Plan B. So wait and see if you miss your period, if you do, take a test.<br>  <br>  If you just had sex Saturday, you wouldn't be having pregnancy symptoms this early.|`|AA10376777	The morning after pill makes it so that the embryo can't attach to the uterine wall. If you took it you won't get pregnant, just expect your period to come soon. You eating more is most likely due to the fact that you are physically active. I play soccer and can down like 3-4 plates of food! I'm 5'5'' and weigh about 140lbs! Rugby is a very active sport which requires you to  burn a lot of calories, fat and other nutrients from your body. You eating a lot is just part of your active life.|`|iFAlZfVMaa	it's possible, but not probably. <br>  <br>  in my experience, most pregnancy symptoms don't hit THAT early.  it's probably not that you're eating more.  you're just worried and panicked and NOTICING how much you're eating.  see your dr or go to a clinic (like planned parenthood) and tell them what you've said here.|`|gKNRJbVYaa	I think the point of plan B is so you won't get pregnant. I think you can take it up to 3 days after intercourse. I think your safe from pregnancy but try going on the pill so you don't have these scares. Plan B is probably effecting your body causing you to be hungry.|`|tTuSUpt9aa	Nothing is ever guaranteed.  Basically if you are on birth control, used condoms with spermicide, and also Plan B.. you still have a 0.1% chance to get pregnant.  Your best choice right now is to make sure you are keeping track of everything, like last day of last period, when you had sex, any spotting, and around 4 weeks after sexual intercourse take a pregnancy test. If you do it too early it could be a false negative. When it comes back negative, wait a couple days until you try another. If i comes back positive, go to the neighborhodd health clinic, planned parenthodd, or your doctor to be retested.<br>  <br>  Wish you all the best!|`|SiEpVRuOaa	you have PMS or your hormones are off.  the liklihood you are pregnant is very vey slim.  relax.  you are going to start soon.
C55pji5Qaa	My MFM said their was no real evidence suggesting this.He did tell me that when they study high TSH levels and the effects of it in pregnancy they focus on the 1st trimester.But their is no answer,only speculation.|`|t4HXotwEaa	I googled it and found this medical study. <br>  <a href="http://medgenmed.medscape.com/viewarticle/412221_print" rel="nofollow">http://medgenmed.medscape.com/viewarticl...</a>
LKu4YQZuaa	Im 28 weeks and 2 days pregnant and ive never experienced this.<br>  I do have some dull pains occasionally, usually in my groin area.. Ive never had really sharp pains. Maybe its braxton hicks (im not sure if they affect people in different ways) I guess everyone experiences different pains during pregnancy.<br>  Its probably nothing to worry about, but if you are worried, just consult your midwife..<br>  <br>  Congrats on your pregnancy and good luck with your little boy! x|`|zF1MRdUFaa	it's normal to get small contractions at 28 weeks that sounds like it might be what you are describing. You may want to contact your doctor though, they may want you to come in just to be sure it is nothing more serious.
apJ3t9k8aa	well i was induced at 36 weeks due to high blood pressure. i arrived at the hospital at 8 that night and they put a little pill into my cervix to start to loosen up a bit. the next morning they took it out and started me on the petocin in an IV. i felt ok, just a bit of period like cramping for a few hours. mind you they started the IV around 8 in the morning. then by noonish the contractions started getting much stronger, but not really unbearable. while on the IV i wasn't able to walk around or anything, just sit or lay down. a couple hours later my doc came in and broke my water and that was when i really started to feel the pain. the contractions were so intense that i couldn't breath through them. they started to come with in second of each other. when one would ease a stronger one would start. after a bit i got the epidural and that was a god send!  so my doc checked me the last time and i was only dilated to 4 centimeter on just the one side! anyways, all the while, my son was not happy with all the stress so they kept loosing his heartbeat, so by 4 that afternoon i was headed to surgery for a c-section. <br>  <br>  not the best story but it just shows that if the time is not right it will be known.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I was induced the day I went two weeks overdue.  Hospital policy is not to let a women go longer then 2 weeks overdue. <br>  <br>  I went into the hospital at 6:00 a.m.  I had dilated two more centimeters the night before.  Friday at the doctor I was 2 cm.  then when I went in I was 4.  <br>  <br>  They broke my water at 7:00 am and I started feeling minor contractions.  A little later they started pitocin.  I started having contractions on and off.  By noon I was in labor, having contractions back to back.  they kept messing with the pitocin, I was very sensitive to it so they couldn't get a good dosage going for me, I was either having constant contractions or hardly any.  At 4:00, I had only dilated to 5 cms, so I advised to get an epidural so I would loosen up and relax.  About 2 hours laters at 6300 I was fully dialated.  I began pushing about 7:00.  I pushed and pushed for over 4  hours.  MY sons head was hung up on my pelvis and wasn't descending.  At that point we started discussin the possiblity of a c-section.   Then my son's heart rate started dropping and he passed meconium so I was rushed into surgery for a c-section.  AT 11:44 my precious little boy entered the world in perfect shape, scoring an 8 on the apgar at birth, a 10   5 minutes later.    <br>  <br>  It was the best day of my life!|`|yB5go5wbaa	I was 42 weeks exactly - at my doctor's appointment the previous day, I was 2cm and 30% effaced. My doctor swept my membranes and scheduled me to go I to the hospital the next day unless I went into labor that night.  The next day, they started me on pitocin at 1pm and increased it every 20 minutes.<br>  <br>  After 6 hours, I was only 3cm and 60% effaced so they broke my water.  I started having huge contractions and asked for an epidural, but the anesthesiologist took a half an hour to get there.  She told me that I'd get the epidural and be able to sleep for a few hours and then have the baby.  Howeverrrr...the epidural didn't work because my contractions were so big and because he started coming down quickly - I went from 3 to 10 cm in an hour.  I didn't feel the epi and wanted to start pushing.  The nurse kept telling me not to, which is impossible...the doctor was still delivering another baby and she didn't want to do it by herself.  I didn't care though, I had to push!  I pushed 4 times and the doctor came and with the last push, he caught my baby and there he was.  No pain meds, but I had 45 stitches.|`|SjX72fPyaa	I was induced 9 days after my due date. I went in at 11:30 in the morning and they hooked me up to an IV with pitocin and since I was GBS positive they also gave me a dose of penicillin. But nothing was happening so they had to break my water around 7pm and then my contractions started almost immediately. I got the epidural at about 8pm and took a nap. Then at about 5:30am they woke me up and told me to get ready to push. After the first few pushes they realized nothing was happening so they used the forceps to deliver Aisling and she was born at 5:52am. She had the cord wrapped around her neck 3 times. <br>  All in all, I was in labour for about 11-11.5 hours.|`|dwdLkvgPaa	Induced with my 1st baby at 42 weeks and 3 days....I went at 9am  they put the cerividil in and that didn't work so they put one more in later on that same day...and that didn't really work either...they started pit and I started to have contractions and I only was dilated to 3 and my Dr told me they would let me go a couple more hours and well nothing happened so they done a c-section after about 28hrs or so...we found out after the fact that the cord was wrapped around my babies neck...|`|hXoUFWL1aa	I went in at 6am on Nov 2nd..they started the pitocin. I was in labor for 38 hrs..my son was not born til 9:26pm on the 3rd. It was so bad. The pain was okay because I had an epidural, I was just restless, I couldn't eat or drink. I was sooooooo ready for him to come, but my body just wasn't responding. They had a catheter in me the whole time which gave me a bad kidney and bladder infection and I had to go back to the hospital when my son was a week old and was in there for 3 days.|`|NVmDVBPyaa	I was induced with my third baby.  I am now due March 12!!  <br>  I was 3 cm dilated and 50%effaced so that made the pitocin work it's magic.  I had an epidural (which took a while to get going) but once it did, it was an easy delivery and my son was born about 5 hours after the pitocin started.<br>  If you choose not to have an epidural and you are not effaced or the baby's position is high, it might be a much harder labor than going without pitocin.|`|a0d6dd0a39d9780e1f9491ff538495d3aa	I was induced once and had my labor augmented twice. <br>  <br>  Baby #1 admitted at 40 weeks 2 days for low amniotic fluid levels for induction fingertip dilated. I was given cervadil and then cytotec and then a Demerol shot then an epidural and pitocin. I was in the hospital three days before I gave birth. She was 7 lb 18 1/2 inches.<br>  <br>  Baby #2 admitted at 39 weeks 4 days contracting regularly and 4 cm dilated. I was given iv and my contractions tapered off. My membranes were artificially ruptured and it didn't help. When the ob said he was going to augment because I was failing to progress I asked for an epidural. The first epidural had a cinch in the catheter so I had to get it redone once they figured out that was the problem. I didn't feel the urge to push but he came out pretty quickly- under 5 minutes pushing. He was 7 lb 7 oz 20 inches.<br>  <br>  Baby #3 I was having contractions for a couple of days before my membranes ruptured. There were signs of light meconium staining so I went to the hospital. I was hoping that I would be able to go drug free. I got a hep lock put in for the first few hours but I wasn't progressing very fast because of how the baby was positioned. I was admitted at 3 cm 50% and 4 hrs later I was 4-5 cm 75%. My ob decided to augment even though I asked for more time. I tried to get him to descend using the birth ball and standing and walking a little bit but it didn't help. The pitocin made my back labor unbearable to the point that I was begging for an epidural. After that it was a couple of hours before my baby boy was born. He was 7 lb 8 oz 20 1/2 inches and is 2 weeks 5 days old.|`|9scpRClxaa	Induced at 37 weeks due to PROM and no contractions after 18 hours after water broke.  Did not get an epidural and for me it was not as bad as my natural birth, but that is rare.  However, I stayed at 2-3 cm despite how they kept cranking up the drip for 7 hours after the drip was started.  The OB came in and told me they would do a c-section in about 2 hours.  My son got his act together and we got him out without surgery just before my "time limit" was up.  I think it helps to not have an entourage in the delivery room.<br>  <br>  My xSIL was induced for post dates.  She ended up having a c-section, but all the relatives were there in the delivery room waiting for the baby's arrival.|`|r1KS5GsDaa	i went to be induced due to high blood pressure a week before my due date. the baby was allready to be born. they hooked me up to the pitocin at 1:30PM after keeping me waiting 4 hours. i stayed on the medicine for 36 hours before i volunteered for a c-section the medicine did nothing for me. didnt dialtae me or bring on contractions. in 36 hours i was barely 3 cm.<br>  <br>  i had my c-section which took about 20 minutes and my daughter was born 8.27.08 at 11:58PM.|`|A3sIn87Qaa	I was induced with my first son after being two weeks over due. I have three kids and all three deliveries were different. It took me longer to have my first though. I also had an epidural with my first, my other two I went natural. to me was the best thing I done seems like I had a easier time delivering with out medications. Being induced isn't that bad only makes contractions a little more intense because they are giving you medicine to get contractions started. hope this is helpful and good luck in your delivery .|`|8zfNPqv1aa	I was induced 4 days before my due date, due to complications. They brought me in at 3 and starting giving me pills to ready my cervix at 5. I started the pitocen at 3 in the morning. My little boy was born at 9:10 that morning. I dialted quickly, i went from four cent. to 10 in 20 minutes and he was born 5 minutes after that.
QsbB6vkoaa	yes it's possible, very rare but possible indeed. if that is the case they would be bi-paternal twins.<br>  after the children are born you can do some DNA testing to be sure.<br>  but it all depends, i mean did you have sex with 2 different men? if you did, then it might be possible that you might have bi-paternal twins.<br>  if you didn't then that only means that you are having fraternal twins, and that your twins aren't going to be identical.|`|A0NfgNEiaa	if u had sex with 2 men within a couple of days then yes but i have never heard of a case like it it must be super rare|`|AA10371609	There are some things you have to remember, every baby grows at a different rate.  They estimate gestational age by the approximate size of the baby.  So if they are different sizes right now, they will be estimated at different gestational ages.<br>  <br>  If they are identical twins, they have the same father. If they are not, they came from different eggs and if you had sex with more than one guy, they could have different fathers, but it is probably unlikely.|`|gBEq0zo5aa	Yes if they came from 2 different eggs (they are fraternal not identical twins). But, this is very unlikely- most likely is that you ovulated close to the same time with both, they were fertilized by the same person (sperm can live for up to 5 days!) and they have the same father. Just because by size they are a week apart does not mean that they were conceived a week apart- it just means one is smaller than the other.|`|5jjGo6XTaa	yes there can be two fathers if u had two eggs had sex and one became planted then a week later that egg still remaind had sex with another man and that egg became planted then thats how their would be two fathers. Its doughtful but possibal i would tell each man you had sex with that they maybe the fathers. but just because one baby is small then the other that does not mean u conciened at different times. With twins they are small and one might be just getting more food then the other. But still inform the man that they can be fathers of these babies.|`|vZwJyqc6aa	I think technically it's possible but not likely.|`|zF4acGKPaa	There is a small chance that it is possible for different fathers. If you released two eggs and had sex with two different guys within a day or two than yes there is a small chance. Also there is the other thing that is more probable one child could just be developed more than the other one.|`|ukwvwVzraa	well actually it has happened before but more than likely its not the case..in twins some babys just dont grow as fast and they could have been conceived at the same time...its more likely that it happened if u had sex with the two different guys within 48hours..hope all turns out well for you tho GL|`|IJBwGrooaa	yes if they are fraternal twins they can have different fathers if they are identical twins then they have the same father.
be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	Well I don't it's normal for anyone to have persistent diarrhea, especially a pregnant woman in her third trimester. Diarrhea is actually very common in pregnant women however, and could be the result of a number of things. The more common culprits are lactose intolerance, dietary or hormonal changes, and sensitivities to certain foods. <br>  <br>  Since you are in your third trimester, it is common to have diarrhea right before delivery. Have you been severely constipated? If so this could just be your body's way readjusting itself properly. Just make sure you remain hydrated. If you begin to experience fever or pain associated with it, then you need to seek care immediately. Also, be checking your stool for blood or mucous, as you will as also need immediate care for this.|`|O97ZoHGXaa	i had really persistent diarrhea also for weeks on end.. i didn't feel unwell though, none of the normal stomach cramps. Just very lose bowels.<br>  I would;t worry, it's a pain yes!<br>  so long as you have seeked medical help and been told there is nothing wrong ( i remember how frustrating it was when they told me they couldn't do anything)<br>  you sound like your doing everything right, just keep the fluids up!!!!
IXskJPlVaa	Both can be off the exact date - mostly is give or take 2 weeks. Why worry? Ultimately it is the doc who has the last word. Show him the ER report and discuss. Best of luck.|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	ultrasound would be more accurate.|`|eeyGYRcPaa	my ultrasound says i'm 19 weeks pregnant...so i go off that. lol|`|f1c3e4fed0bc8c4bf3636c69cd65cebfaa	Measurements are not an exact science.  You could very well be 13 weeks with a larger sized baby.  There is no way for the ER docs to tell exactly how far you are.  All they can do is measure and guesstimate.  Your doc IS going off you LMP.  Which means if your date was wrong, their estimate will be wrong. There is nothing wrong with measuring a couple of weeks bigger.  And a couple of weeks when it comes down to the end of the pregnancy doesn't matter much anyway.  Pregnancy is considered full term anytime AFTER 37 weeks.  So your OK.  Stick to your original due date and don't be surprised if your baby shows up two weeks early or so!|`|MbmHripJaa	ok-- if your periods were completely normal before you got pregnant go by what your doctor said. If not go by what the ER said... I had 2 different doctors.. in the beginning of my pregnancy they went by my lmp also and the due date was oct. 12. the 2nd doc i went to went by measurements and weight- that due date was oct. 24... well I had my son on the 13th, my contractions started on the 12th. so the 1st doc was right.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	when they do ultra sounds they should be able to tell
bTlhBX3daa	On my Dr's list of med's that it's okay to take:<br>  <br>  Sudafed<br>  Tylenol Cold<br>  Cough drops|`|CuCrGDuRaa	You may want to check with your doctor just in case, but mine recommended Tylenol taken along with the original plain Sudafed that is kept behind the counter.  I hope you get better soon!|`|6yy0jtzDaa	you can benadryl, robatussion MD and tylenol cold just getting over one myself|`|AA10371609	You can have benadryl, Robitussin, Tylenol, and Cepacol throat lozenges.  Be sure you're drinking plenty of fluids and you don't have a fever.<br>  <br>  Sorry you're sick!  It really sucks being pregnant and sick.  I had a horrible headcold around 8 weeks, and thought I was going to never get over it.|`|tTh2Q7etaa	i had a congestion problem the entire time i was pregnant, they say its really common to suffer from that because there is increase blood flow to your mucus membranes. i tried not to use medicine so i used something called neilmed. it is a salt water solution you basically spray it up one side of your nose and it goes through your sinuses and it runs down the other side of your nose. i know it sounds gross but it works so well if i hadn't used that i would have had to take a decongestants everyday.|`|lLyyuPpvaa	I see most people answered this rather well....but they forgot one.  It is commonly overlooked, Vick's vapo-Rub.  It was the only thing that let me breath at night when i had a cold.  Robitussin can only do so much, without the DM, or the really good kind, or Nyquil, it's rough.  Go with the vapo-rub, you won't regret it :)|`|XhzwLFieaa	My doctor told me just plain Sudafed...no cough drops though. I asked about those specifically and she said deffinetly not. Hope you get to feeling better soon!!
G2auAv1Saa	I was diagnosed with diabetes long before I had children but when I am pregnant my insulin resistance is worse and my insulin doses triple and I do have to change things up a bit. <br>  Fatigue is definetly a sign, but this could also be low iron levels. Seeing floaters is what happens when your blood sugar gets too high. Next time you see floaters, drink water and think about what you have consumed in the past hour and avoid it or cut the portion down. I have never had vomitting unless my sugar was very low (under 30) and I get cold sweats along with it. <br>  You will have to change your diet, they will give you certain menus and portions and you will have to check your blood sugar after each meal as well as check your urine for ketones every morning. Your doctor should set you  up with a nutritionist to go over what you can and can't eat. You may have to take insulin, since GD is mainly from insulin resistance. <br>  If he sends you to an endocrinologist, you will have an extra appointment every month. Towards the end they will be checking the baby size more often and checking the placenta frequently. GD babies are usually born larger but that's not always the case, my daughter was 7.6 and I was able to have her vaginally. The placenta usually breaks down earlier but not always, I went a week overdue. Depending on the size of the baby and condition of the placenta they may have you deliver early and do a c-section. Once the baby is born they will also be checking his sugar levels more frequently. <br>  Hope it goes well for you, but if you end up having it- it's not the end of the world.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I'm having twins so I was tested for gestational diabetes at 16 weeks, but it was negative.  However, I do know that fatigue is common if you have gestational diabetes and your blood sugar is high, and dizziness and fatigue when your blood sugar is low.  But many people who fail the first test do pass the second.  My friend had gestational diabetes and just needed to change her diet and check her blood sugar everyday.  Good luck!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I got diagnosed with Gestational diabetes back when I was 28 weeks and I have the occasional floaters but mainly the only thing I experience is fatigue when my sugars are high and shaky when my sugars are low. Now that I have GD I have to have another ultrasound at 36 weeks to check my baby's growth. I don't have an extreme case of GD so I just control it with diet but if you have it bad enough you may have to go on insulin. Good luck!
DTYHoinVaa	I live in NY state, as soon as i found out i was pregnant I got TAP and Pell grants that covered all of my tuition, that was back in like 97 and i was also 19, but i assume the guidelines are not totally different now. Its worth a try. Good luck. Oh, and it wont be easy but try to stick it out. I did and it was worth it.<br>  <br>  And the first answer is ignorance. I finished my masters with 2 young babies at home. Dont pay attention to that kind of advice.|`|5SCKHiPAaa	Yes, there are grants and scholarships for colleges, and there are also loans. Go to the financial office at the school and sign up. Good luck, and congratulations!!|`|qusZuvqoaa	There is no financial aid for being pregnant but there is financial aid for you once you have your child if you do not make enough money basically. <br>  <br>  Once you have your baby you will be considered independant and with an infant if you have no income or very little income you will qualify for full state and federal aid.<br>  <br>  I agree with poster #2, do not listen to ignorant people, you can finish school and have a baby. I am 24, expecting #2 and in the process of doing a Bachelors/Masters combined program, should be done at 27.  Granted you adjust and make changes and it takes a bit longer, but who cares, its worht it in the end .|`|t0K6Haoyaa	nope. sounds like you should have invested in birth control... do your college as long as you can until the baby comes, then most likely you won't have time for it anymore.
DxoodgOtaa	omg i am so sorry.<br>   first of all, the pill isnt 100% effective. i dont think it really matters what time of day you take it from the last. you could go to your doctor and see how far along you are. they'll hopefully be able to trace back to the day the baby was conceived by how far along your pregnancy is.<br>   as far as your mom and dad, you should sit them down one night alone and calmly tell them everything. explain to them that you made a mistake. do they know about the rape? if not, be honest with them. and then tell them 'i know you must be extremely shocked and disappointed in me, but i need your support.' and then later on mention that you wanna keep the baby. and a baby doesnt just throw away everything. it'll just make things different. but dont give up because you are going to be a teen mom. you can still fulfill your life and dreams with a child. it'll just be different.<br>  <br>  i hope i helped you. best of luck.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	It very well could be your boyfriend's baby because the medicine they gave you after your rape to prevent std's may have cancelled out your birth control. Certain medications will make birth control ineffective. I'm very sorry about what happened to you and I pray that things get better for you. You do need to tell your parents though and the sooner you tell them the better.|`|pp9RzHvDaa	I am so sorry!  First thing you need to do is tell your parents.  They will help you.  Just tell them everything you told us here, even that you are sexually active with your boyfriend.  They will take you to the doctor and the doctor will see how far along you are.  Of course, it is very unlikely they will pinpoint the actual day you conceived, but the only thing you can do is wait until you have the baby.  You can get a paternity test if you want to if your boyfriend wants to know.  If you have a hard time telling your parents things, try writing it and leaving it for them when you go to school in the morning.  Or hand it to them and watch them read it so you won't have to worry about it all day at school.  If you just can't take it, please give the baby up for adoption.|`|VxEmYVbhaa	Well there was already a chance for you to get pregnant if you were sexually active with your boyfriend! Anyway, go to the doctor and ask them to determine or attempt to determine how far along you are and then you should know whose baby it is....and then once it's born, you can have DNA testing. <br>  Good luck!!!|`|9d99924ae7cd2add40a289bc1930a1b4aa	i dont know how accurate can it be but the doctor determines by the size of the baby, the babys weeks,,, maybe that can help ,, so u need to get an ultrasound...<br>  <br>  also im sorry for whats happening to you , i hope everything goes well|`|f1c3e4fed0bc8c4bf3636c69cd65cebfaa	OK, you're 14.  You have no idea what kind of life you'd be signing up for if you kept this baby.  The doctor could give you an estimate as far as when you conceived.  Keep in mind though that there is approx. 5-7 days a month when a woman has the best chance of getting pregnant. If your sexual encounters were close together and around the time of conception, there isn't really any way to tell. The doc can't tell you "you conceived on Thursday, Feb. 19 th at 3:45 pm"  It isn't like that. You need to just be honest with your parents and tell them.  They love you and are there to support you and help you through these things.  It may be a shock to them initially, but they do love you and will be there to help you. You are going to need their support in making your decisions.  Keep in mind also, if it turns out your bf is not the father, you will have a daily reminder of the rapist. Trust me I know how this is.  It isn't easy.  Best of luck to you!|`|ur1bnkrZaa	dude!<br>  this is why our world is fallin in the crapper!<br>  we got babys having babys.<br>  this is sick!<br>  tell your parents cause there the ones who will end up having to raise the baby anyways.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	You can get pregnant on the pill.  Its not as common, but you can.<br>  <br>  I am sorry for what happened to you, that is very sad.<br>  <br>  In order to find out who's the father of the baby, you need to get a DNA test when the baby is born.  For now you can calculate it like this.<br>  <br>  First day of your last period.  Count 14-15 days after the first day, that is likely the day conception occurred.  Anytime from the day 10-16 (if you had sex in that time frame) would probably mark who the father is.  But there is no real way to tell without a dna test.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you can get past this and get some answers.|`|o38uYuRJaa	if you are wanting to keep the baby then you need to tell your mum and dad. or if it would be easier another member of the family to tell them. you need to make sure you have all there support if you are going to go through with this. you have no idea how life changing a baby is ! i had a beautiful baby boy when i was 14 and i had all the support of my parents. it was really hard even with them so i would hate to think how hard it is for someone without that support !<br>  To find out the father of the baby you would have to wait till the baby is born and then have a dna test from you boyfriend. it would probably be impossible to check for the rapist, so if the father isnt your boyfriend then he is the main suspect.<br>  I wish you all the best luck in your decision =)
W1p6LetFaa	It could just be your body adjusting to the birth control itself.  A lot of birth control has side effects that are very similar to pregnancy, but these symptoms go away as your body adjusts to the hormones.  I could have SWORN that I was pregnant when I first started birth control, except for the fact that I was still a virgin!  I had the sore boobs, the spotting, slight weight gain, everything!  But it went away in a month or two once my body figured out what was going on.  If you still think you are pregnant, wait a few more days or a week and test again, but I bet it's just your body adjusting to the birth control.  Good luck!!|`|Vjem5OJhaa	If you are between puberty and menapause, and you have had sex (even protected), there is a chance you could be pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Take a pregnancy test or consult your doctor.|`|FE3Pc1SZaa	if you started the pill it could just be that sometimes when you start the pill your hormone levels have to adjust so it makes your menstrual cycle all messed up but if your really worried about it go see your gyn better to be safe|`|Z3iuNCeMaa	yes it take 30days on a pill if u used no protecton there always the chance of getting peg. and also a big chance of getting S T D  GOOD LUCK SWEETIE|`|hD4D2ce3aa	yeah i would wait until feb. 21 or just go to the doctors for a blood test.<br>  good luck.|`|3w7VztEWaa	Ya wait awhile longer..there's always that possibility.
qBtTAgBqaa	No.. you don't need the cry it out method. What's going on is he has a 'suck-to-sleep' association. My 6yr old had it when he was nursing.<br>  <br>  Go and get the book "No Cry Sleep Solution" by Elizabeth Pantley. Best book out there. My son went from 8-10 night wakings down to maybe one and then eventually none at all.<br>  <br>  You have to consider what your son knows.. all he knows and all he's ever known is that he get's nursed to sleep, he gets snuggled up next to an all night "breastaurant" LOL  Cry it out is probably devistating to him.  There ARE ways to do it WITHOUT the crying. Trust me. Why put your son or yourself through all that.. especially if things end up backfireing on you and he's waking even more.. or starts becoming clingy and anxious all day.<br>  <br>  Here are a few links with some helpful information to get you and your son going towards a good nights sleep.<br>  <a href="http://www.pantley.com/elizabeth/books/0071381392.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.pantley.com/elizabeth/books/0...</a><br>  <br>  31 WAYS TO GET YOUR BABY TO GO TO SLEEP AND STAY ASLEEP EASIER<br>  <a href="http://askdrsears.com/html/7/T070300.asp" rel="nofollow">http://askdrsears.com/html/7/T070300.asp</a><br>  <br>  Changing The Sleep Pattern In The Family Bed<br>  <a href="http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/ap/sleep.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/a...</a><br>  <br>  and fwiw, I was never able to night wean any of my kids until after their first birthday. My twins are 18 months old an have only been sleeping all night since a couple months ago.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	read ferber's book and follow his instructions|`|6GxKOeVnaa	I had a friend with the same situation, and she finally switched her child to her own room and own crib.  She did let her cry it out and the first night no sleep and the second her child only cried for 10 minutes.  She said she thinks her child just needed to be in her own room with no distractions and she also put a Humidifier for white noise.  i really believe not every child is a good candidate for co-sleeping.  I myself put my child in her crib at 2 months and let her cry it out at six months when I stopped her night feeding and she is now 11 months old and sleeps rather well.  I know everyone says cry it out but if you can put up with it for a few nights it will pay off.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	Are you using a pacifier? I would probably be up all night nursing without one. I'm glad you aren't letting him cry it out. If you go to Dr. Sears website, they have a list that you can go thorugh to see if you can find a physical reason for his awakenings. I'm againt the CIO method, but I do let my 9 month old cry in my arms while I'm rocking him if he just doesn't want to go to sleep. You might have to try  a few different things before one works. Good luck and lots of research!|`|GCSFnc4Haa	i only have my opinion but i will share....i know breast milk is better for a baby but when my son was 2 months i weened him off because hed eat every 30 mins and i needed rest as soon as we switched him to a bottle HES SLEPT 2 NAPS A DAY FOR 3 HOURS AND SLEPT THROUGH THE NIGHT 7-7 i know im lucky!!! when  he was first born he refused to sleep in a bassinet or play pen (still refuses to sleep in the play pen) but when i transfered him into a crib hed fall right to sleep. my best friend a mother of 5 had this problem with her middle child and heres what she told me to do.<br>  if you use perfume or anything on yourself spray his blanket or sheet with it and let the air get to it before putting it in his crib. if you dont take a shirt with your scent on it and put it in his crib ( ive personaly done this after my son was old enough to crawl) sit on the floor of his room and dont make any noise maybe hes just so used to being with or around you that he needs you there for comfort. rub/pat his back. try some type of music low in his room. this is all advice i have gotten from other mothers so im hoping this helps you|`|dpMssGdnaa	I'm so sorry to hear your having the same issue. I still haven't figure it out and my baby is 9 months I'm just praying that some day I'll be able to recover my sleep. my baby only has two 30 minute naps during the day so yours sleeps better :(|`|qeIwDGF0aa	At present your baby is in bed for 10 hours and he spends part of this time crying. Start by giving him some cereal before bedtime so that he won't be hungry and putting him to bed later, at around 10 p.m.  Do not overstimulate him just before bedtime. Ensure that the room is not too hot nor too cold.Feed him to help him to sleep and when he is sleepy give him a pacifier. When he falls asleep withdraw the pacifier so that he will not become dependent on it.Your baby may still be up by 5 am. but if he doesn't cry at night you will be able to sleep well during that short period.My baby was just like yours.She cried every night for the first 3 months but after the third month she slept very well from 9pm. to 6 am., without taking her feed or wetting herself.Get someone to help you even if it means your baby has to take some of his feed from a bottle.Good luck!|`|1VOsRV8Maa	First of all, your baby is my baby's age, and I would say the only healthy way to get your baby to sleep is to make him sleep in his own room. There is a great book called "The baby sleep Solution" that I have used with my own son. It teaches you how to feed him enough in the day to help keep him "full" all night. It also teaches you step by step how to cut out nighttime feedings. My baby has been sleeping 12 hours STRAIGHT through the night since he was 3 months old! Before then, he would be up every 4-5 hours and need mama's nipple. But, then I read "The Baby Sleep Solution" and I'll never regret it! Also, you have to remember that you're the parents. Your child should NOT have you up all night! You make the rules. And start by making your son take naps in HIS OWN BED... Then, start incorporating his own bed at night. If you make him take naps in his own bed, he will prefer that bed at night. And make sure you are using his bed only for sleep so that he knows when you put him in there, it's time to sleep. Don't use his bed as a place for him to play, otherwise he'll never sleep in there. Get that book, though! It's very short, and you can read it maybe once every 2 weeks or so until your son is sleeping through the night on his own! If you try this out, please keep me updated on the progress of your little boy! Good luck! God bless!<br>  <br>  EDIT: It's possible that your son's mattress is uncomfortable for him. We had to get our son a new mattress, and it helped him a LOT! :)|`|cDVAEHgCaa	Start by putting him his crib (in your room) for ALL of his naps.  It's easier to transition a baby to a crib during the day, because they can see what they are sleeping in, and it's not so intimidating.  Don't break down and give in by putting BACK in the bed for naps.  You MUST be consistent.<br>  <br>  Once he is sleeping in his crib for naps full-time, try to put him in the crib at bedtime.  For the first week or so, if he fusses excessively, put him in the bed.  But always try the crib first.  Soon, you should notice that he is sleeping in the crib for longer periods of time.  <br>  <br>  The point is, if you make the nighttime crib a battle, he won't EVER want to sleep in it.  But, if you nonchalantly allow him to get back in the bed, he won't be so against the idea.  <br>  <br>  Make sure the crib is situation such that he can see you.  Right next to the bed is best, IMO, at least for a little while.<br>  <br>  It's going to take some time for him to get adjusted.  <br>  <br>  My daughter transitioned to a crib by the time she was 5.5 months old, and it took about a week.  But, she was younger than your baby, which is why it didn't take so long.  The older the baby gets, the more set in his ways he gets.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.
9a3sNrEqaa	the transvaginal ultrasound is like a little wand that they insert into the vagina. The u/s tech can get a much better picture than using an abdominal ultrasound. I had both on tuesday at 7 wks 5 days and they could see the baby with the abdominal one but when they did the transvaginal one it was so much clearer! you could actually see the little leg buds! it was beautiful!!!! It is a little bit uncomfy if you don't relax ur muscles. As soon as you relax its way less comfy!!!!! GOOD LUCK HUN!!!!!!!!!!!!! its awesome seeing the babys heartbeat its like a flickering on the screen! ur heart is gonna melt!!!!!!!|`|LVrqRCh8aa	Yes they do =]<br>  They don't feel so great tho! =/|`|i3pn4jNcaa	yup :]|`|gBEq0zo5aa	The ultrasound will look the same, although you really wont be able to identify a lot of parts- the older the baby is the easier they are to see. I had one at 13 weeks and I could see the baby's skeleton- arms, legs, body, skull, etc. You can't really see a face- you might be able to see the heart beat- sometimes it looks like a blinking light. Just know that your 20 week ultrasound will be a lot clearer. You won't be able to tell if it's a boy or girl- although some people claim they found out this early. I asked the tech and she said- way too early! They just put a little wand like thing in your vagina- I don't know why people would say it hurts- it just feels like a tampon. And the tech may move it a little to get better views. They cover you with a sheet and everything so don't be nervous that all your stuff is going to be hanging out there for everyone to see! The tech will point out the different parts and take some measurements on their computer screen and probably send you home with a picture. Congrats and good luck!|`|tx2gvd43aa	I just got back from my appointment yesterday. I am exactly 13 wks today and my doctor gave me an ultrasound yesterday and it was the abdominal kind. I had a vaginal ultrasound at my appointment before when I was right around  9 wks. It seemed to me that the vaginal one was clearer, but I would much rather get the abdominal one again. My last ultrasound the baby was bouncing around and moving. I think that your doctor could easily give you the abdominal one and you would see everything fine. Good luck with your appointment and congrats!! :)|`|vygYFdsSaa	At my first ultrasound, I got both abdominal and vaginal. They gave me pictures to take home with each. The vaginal ultrasound actually gives you clearer pictures, which is probably why your doctor is recommending it. The baby was moving around when they were taking my pictures but they are all profile shots (whether ab or vag.) so yes, the pictures should be the same!!! In my case they were better :) Congratulations.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	never had a vaginal one at 12 weeks!...why are they doing it?.....they usually do that when your real early..i guess every doc is different...i had a vag one at 7 weeks at my first appt...it just looked like a peanut but the pic of the uterus and fluid looked the same as the reg ones....so my guess is it should look the same,maybe youll get a better view?......but the baby is big enough to tell its a baby now not just a clump.......you should be able to see profile,hands ,feet,face,skull,eye sockets and limbs...it will look just like a baby but really little.........|`|VFUdAtrHaa	im sorry but your dates don't add up im due may 4th and thats in 11 weeks. your going for your 12 week ultrasound then your would only be 1 week pregnant and you wouldn't even know if you are pregnant or not. Maybe you got the date mixed up or soemthing but yes they look the same. They feel distgusting though and mine really hurt. they wont be doing that again!|`|OT6vCUU1aa	I was just reading your question and I see your due sept 15... I am due sept 24 but I will be 12wks March 12th. Did u mean march? I got a little confused for a sec. lol I had a vaginal u/s done at 7wks and it looked as if it were looking at it head on. I do not know for sure though but a vaginal may even be more clearer since it isnt going through your belly and it is internal. You know what I mean?|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	Well it is hard to say bc the vaginal is usually done just at the begining<br>  but i have had 5 vaginal ones with the same baby & it looks pretty much the same to me.. but the first ones always look like aliens then later it starts lookin like a baby|`|sSRHQkROaa	I had one at 8 weeks and the baby was just mushy looking. they did a profile, but he was very little thats why they had to do the vaginal. but when i went they did abdominal too so maybe they will do both for you.|`|LBg4DNpCaa	When I was 6 weeks pregnant my dr had to give me a vaginal ultrasound the baby was very tiny but it was a regular ultrasound picture. Good luck.|`|yv6OLTfraa	Yeah they do. I actually think the vaginal ones are clearer. It's nice when you start doing abdominal ones though and can keep your clothes on... the vaginal ones were always uncomfortable for me.|`|96HWpdkFaa	Yeah I did..and it will be more clear then the abdominal one! Mine was a profile veiw. I got one at 7 weeks. =) It's fine, a bit uncomfy but once you see the baby you won't even notice!|`|yznZqcznaa	Well I am only 10 weeks so all my USs have been vaginal.  The pictures are clearer because you are closer to the uterus.  Usually after 12 weeks they start doing abdominal ones.  The uterus is still behind the pelvis before then and can make it difficult to get accurate images. Also we are due on the same day! Thats cool.
FXINmF6saa	I would say,<br>  <br>  Hi (his name),<br>  I am sending you this letter hoping that you are doing good. I know that you and me really are two different people but even if we couldn't work out I would like to invite you to be in your baby's life. We both know we made mistakes but that is no reason why this should affect your baby in any way or matter. This is still your baby I am carrying and I think you as well have a say in his/her life. If you want to disregard this letter it's completely up to you. You will still be able to see and play with your baby whenever you feel ready. I don't want you to take this letter as though I'm trying to recieve anything in your behalf. That's not the point I'm trying to make. I'm just taking this time to let you know that you're welcome to participate whenever you please. I took the privilege to send you a copy of the ultrasound I just had done, like I said I'm not asking for anything what you do from now on for your baby is completely up to you. <br>  Enjoy the photo!<br>  <br>  Sign|`|Q05rrSX4aa	I would recommend having him come to the ultrasound.  If he is the father, and he is welcomed into this babies life, then I think it would be important that he was there.  You don't have to like each other, but you are going to have to see each other since you are having a child together.  If you do choose to write him a note I would say.<br>  <br>  I am sorry for any pain I have caused, right now we have to move past this and focus on what is important, and that is the child that we are bringing into this world.|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	Just be honest and say something like.<br>  <br>  We both messed up a bit didn't we? But I want you in our baby's life. I'm sorry for the way I acted and i hope we can get past it. Here's a picture of your baby-our baby. I would love for you to be with me to welcome him/her into the world (if that's what you want). Please, think about it at least and write back soon.|`|b1eacc63c481ff40082f035f83d011d1aa	Dear X<br>  <br>  For as long as you and this child lives, you are the father. <br>  <br>  You might marry someone else, and I look forward to having a family with someone in the future ... but that will never change the fact that you have a child.<br>  <br>  Every child should have the chance to know their dad. I aim to raise her/him to be someone to be proud of. You should be part of that too.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry for (some of) the things I said. We have our differences, but that doesn't mean our child has to suffer because of it.<br>  <br>  yours ....
8iBOF2h5aa	yes, it is very unlikely since a condom would be used, but nothing is 100%. You can get pregnant at anytime even while you are still on your period. I got pregnant with my 2nd 3 days after my period.|`|l3MED8Itaa	why are people so clueless about pregnancy. yes its possible.|`|i3pn4jNcaa	theres always a chance but if you used a condom pretty sure you ARENT pregnant.|`|1U0tMNcTaa	no you have just got rid of you egg there will be nothing to get fertilised and <br>    you wont me fertile until 14 days after your period if you have a 28 day cycle. if longer cycle then work it out .<br>  <br>  so no its impossible for you to be pregnant.<br>  double that if you used protection.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Yes, but since you had protected sex your chance is very low as long as the condom was used correctly and didn't break.|`|DxoodgOtaa	yes you can.<br>  but if you used a condom, i DOUBT you are pregnant.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	There is a chance but a very small one if you used the condom right. Good for you for taking responsibility and using a condom!! <br>  <br>  (God is it sad that people need praise for using birth control?)
t4HXotwEaa	Creepy.  Why is he being so controlling?  I think this would really concern me.  If you want your mother there...she should be there.  End of story!|`|faPKwClPaa	He's being a butthead.  I have NO idea why he'd be so opposed to having your mom in there.  Even if those two have butted heads before, this is one of those situations where everyone needs to lay their egos aside and be there for you.<br>  <br>  I suggest you tell him as much; if he still digs his heels in, you may want to really reconsider your relationship with him.  This (your mom being in the delivery room ) is the LEAST of the joint decisions you two will need to make with a baby.|`|0BC2WTyoaa	It's your delivery and you should be the one who chooses who is there.  Moms are sometimes better delivery coaches because they are more maternal and will get what you need.  If he doesn't like it, tell him too bad!  :)|`|AA11604319	Only my husband and I were in the delivery room for all three of our children.  We made the children together and we brought them into the world together.  Sounds like he doesn't want to share  any of the experience with anyone else.  <br>  <br>  I don't think either of you are wrong, but I would think about how he feels too.  Without him, this child would not be possible.<br>  <br>  Congratulations!|`|yznZqcznaa	I think he is kinda out of line.  You are going to need your mom there to support you.  You are giving birth not him.  I would really like my mom to be there.   My husband originally thought just me and him, however I don't even see that as an option.  I want my mom, and my best friend and his mom to be there.  Maybe not all in the room as Im pushing part but for the time leading up to it for sure.|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	i had my mom, hubby both in the room. have both. one hold the legs and one help ya through. simple.|`|0C6VJ8mqaa	he sounds immature.  if you want your mom there, then go for it.  it will be a mother/daughter bonding experience for sure.  best of luck!|`|VFUdAtrHaa	I Think you are totally right. with my 1st pregnancy i had NO ONE in the room i was hours away and was rushed in for preclampsia. This time around im having my finace( not the father of either kids but accepts both) and my mother in the room. I couldn't imainge another time with out my mom. im 29 weeks pregnant now and im getting so anixous. remember its YOUR CHOICE not his. if he wants to miss out on his child being born thats his fault!|`|zF4acGKPaa	i think you are right. This isn't about him its about the baby. It shouldn't be negotiable if he doesn't like it then he needs to grin and bear it or not be in the room and it will be his fault he missed out on the birth of his child!|`|X6PsiVKNaa	No you are not wrong. he is! he should be okay with whatever whats you comfortable. if he is making you chose. forget him. your mother will always be there for you. remember that.|`|JbHdLERgaa	well i had my mum and my partner there and it was great!! <br>  if he decides not to be there over something so small and stupid then its his loss and he will regret it in the long run!!! xxxxxxxx|`|ckgiPMm4aa	Your completely right. Even if he has something against your mother, labor is about you, and your child.<br>  <br>  I think You should maybe write him an e-mail, be very calm and try to explain to him exactly what you said there. That you would feel more comfortable with him and your mother in the delivery room, and that it's not about him, it's about you and your child, and making you comfortable. Maybe he feels like if someone else is in the room, he'll have less of a part, try to explain to him that you would feel comfortable with someone in the room who has actually done it before.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun.<br>  and congrats.|`|gBEq0zo5aa	I think you need to honor your boyfriends wishes because although he is not there pushing the baby out, that is his child as well. He obviously feels uncomfortable around your mother- or around your mother in the same room with your vagina- and honestly what guy wouldn't. Maybe he feels like your mom resents him or something. as you said you are bringing a new life into the world and you are doing it TOGETHER- ask yourself if this is worth an argument- do you really need one more person in there holding your legs and yelling push?! This is a good time to start a new page as a couple- as a family. Don't bring a baby into a relationship where there are bad feelings from the start. Also, if you ever plan on marrying your boyfriend- he will always remember that you chose your old family (your mom) over your new one (him). Put yourself in his shoes and just consider it.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	Is this just your baby or the baby your boyfriend fathered? Whats not negotiable is your boyfriend not being there. This is not your mothers baby, and he has every right to tell you who he wants there and doesn't want there. Again, this is not just your baby. Its about the baby, you and your boyfriend. Not mothers. <br>  Maybe he was offended. Like you believed he wasn't going to support you or coach you. <br>  My 1st baby, my mom was there, my 2nd she was not. My husband just wanted it to be us. And I agreed. My mother did not have to be there for it. And neither does yours.<br>  <br>  I think you need to apologize. Just because your pregnant that does not give you the right to act all spoiled.|`|sRy2SKpXaa	I think you're totally right. It's about what makes YOU feel most comfortable, after all you're the one doing all that work to bring that baby into this world! I think he needs to just let it go, he should be worrying about making YOU feel comfortable, not creating stress and drama for you. What was his reasoning for not wanting her there? Either way, he's in the wrong, and you're totally right. Good luck and I hope it all works out for you.|`|yA3KNKF9aa	I think you're right.  Tell him that you are the one that had to carry this baby around for 9 months and it has not always been easy.  You had to go to all the check ups, gain weight, and your going to be the one going through all the pain during delivery and recovery.  Its not right for him to make the choice.  You're the one that should be comfortable-not him.  Good luck and don't let him control you!|`|KRoSwO6iaa	maybe he is worried about being emotional in front of your mother.<br>  some men are just like that, also its a big deal for them to.<br>  <br>  but its your choice at the end of the day- my mother in law offered to come with me, oopps no way!<br>  <br>  good luck|`|WGXdfh22aa	your the one that will be in labor so it is your decision. why wouldnt he want to go along with whatever makes you feel more comfortable. he is wrong for telling you to choose. i dont understand why he wouldnt want your mom there if you do.|`|5c3dc6072eed79627d5d1cf62b2bbfb5aa	He is in the wrong, he needs to grow up! He should do what ever you want/need giving birth is hard work and he should be there for you and back you up in whatevery you need!|`|HEdGGmkhaa	I had the same problem, but not with my mother, it was with my close friend and his, a doula!<br>  In the end I gave in to him and it was just the 2 of us but he didn't help me one bit, was more concerned with trying to get some sleep and I wanted to slap the man like crazy! It actually made me feel pain more as I was so mad, I believe that if I had the doula there with me, they could have both participated, he could have gotten the rest and I would have had someone there who knew what they were doing!<br>  <br>  Sit him down and explain that your mother has been through it, it's no walk in the park for a woman and you at least deserve 2 sets of hands there.... you could even appeal to his better nature and say it's for him too, it could be long hours and you need someone alert and on the ball, he can rest, take it in turns, he wont miss the birth and you all can be happy!<br>  <br>  Please don't do what I did.
cjcjRvKdaa	I think it's common.  I was really sore with my second--more so than with my first.  I think it is because your body has already been through this once, so it accomodates for the baby faster--resulting in pain! <br>  <br>  I guess we should know how far along you are, though.  Make sure it is the pain of you ligaments stretching and not a cramping feeling.  But by the sounds of it, you sound normal.  Try to take it easy.  I know it hurts to walk, to sit, to stand, to roll over, to move at all!!!  Hang in there!|`|jf4UOCElaa	what you are eating is a big factor when your pregnant but you should ask your probably though
i7oGjwJBaa	walk a lot, and lie on your left side, always.  if you see a midwife or a chiropractor - they have techniques they can use to try to encourage the baby to turn, as well as hypnosis if you are into that.|`|IDo8yXtiaa	this is a website to where I go to get information..... I keyed in the word breech in the search bar located in this site and it pulled up choices of infomation that others have ask and answered. hope this will help...!|`|2DM7MaXyaa	u cant do anything... the dr will turn the baby himself. they just stick there hand up there and push on your belly at the same time and turn the baby... its just a bit uncomfortable but thats all..|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	your doc will take care of that
cjcjRvKdaa	Help her breathe.  Distraction didn't work for me and I would hold my breath and almost pass out.  You must remind her to breathe--this is not instictive when you're in labor.<br>  <br>  Have her concentrate on breathing through each contraction and tell her to breathe slowly and deeply--in and out.  Dont' just tell her, demostrate throughout each contraction entirely and have her breathe with you.  You can also apply firm pressure with your fist to her lower back to help her through the contractions.  She should be able to tell you what helps.  Help her take one contraction at a time.<br>  <br>  ***Addition:  They normally admit you when your contractions are 5 minutes apart.  That's probably why they are tell you not to bring her in yet.  It could also be b/c you say her contractions are "jumping".  Normal contractions are regular with a set amount of time in between each one, as they get closer together.  This is, however, not always the case!  If she is in severe pain, you should take her in and insist she be checked!  With my last child, I never had regular, timed contractions.  Some were only a few seconds apart, while others were 10 minutes--even when I was pushing.  They originally did not think I was in true labor, but I was at 5 cm and quickly progressed to a 9!  Don't leave your sister's side!  She needs you!  Try to get her to walk around if she's able and help her to a wall, chair, etc. during contractions.  This should help her progress.|`|i3pn4jNcaa	take her to the hospital her baby is about to come.|`|3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	She should have gone to hospital a while ago.  call 911 now and get her there ASAP.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	go and get an epidural|`|2DM7MaXyaa	she needs to go to the hospital... she should have gone when they are 15 minutes apart and called and told them she was on her way in... that means the baby is coming VERY soon. good luck and congrats.|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	Get to the hospital asap!|`|DxoodgOtaa	take her to the hospital. her baby is on the way.|`|jf4UOCElaa	she needs to go to the hospital its not good that she getting dizzy|`|1c68aa37678bc208432a61d5735bbbf1aa	call and ambulance....please common sense|`|zF4acGKPaa	go to the hospital|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	Hospital. Now. Don't wait, just go. That baby is well and truly on its way!!! Try and talk to her to relax her on the way-get her to take long slow deep breaths or she will pass out.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Take her to the hospital so they can take care of her and deliver her baby.
96HWpdkFaa	Yes it's a possiblity...mine were sore when I first found out and I'm 8 weeks now and yep still sore! <br>  <br>  Although don't just rely on that..it can also be a sign that your period is on it's way.<br>  <br>  If your worried and you miss a period take a test!|`|rC6gL7KOaa	Take a pregnancy test.|`|OimS5wBJaa	yea it could because then if your baby comes out it can have nutrious milk and if u dont feed ur breast milk alot to ur baby then it get super sore and starts hurting|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	Even before I got a positive pregnancy test, that was my first sign/symptom of pregnancy. Good luck!! It could be!|`|yuGW9AlCaa	yes, or you could be about to start your period.<br>  <br>  Mine have always gotten sore right before then.
6C4ibyF8aa	your baby doesnt hate you :) i'm almost 23 weeks and my baby kicks & moves like crazy one day, and the next i day i dont feel a thing. i first felt her kick when i was 21 weeks, everyone is different though. it's normal, good luck and congrats!|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	I am almost 25 weeks and my baby has her moments. Sometimes she just wants to move all over, and sometimes she stays still for a long time. Don't worry yet. Your baby may be moving and you just might not feel it.|`|RR7UX4jkaa	Maybe your baby is petite. If you were to see in your womb your would probably see it moving around alot. Maybe it's not going to be a UFC fighter but that's ok.|`|z198dj4Baa	im 27 weeks and just started feeling my baby alot i wouldent be to worried about it yet my doctor told me i wouldent really start feeling big movements until about 24 or 25 weeks|`|aNqicXDoaa	NO I am sure your baby doesn't hate you.  I'm not sure how "heavy" you are but they say it takes a little longer to "feel" the baby's movements in heavier set women.  Not sure if thats the case - if not then maybe your baby loves to just keep you in suspense!  Its a wonderful feeling - she'll come around and then at midnight you'll be begging her to "SETTLE DOWN!" LOL|`|GZ0bEbPuaa	Well then its probably pretty normal..Some advice to you is to lay down and have quiet time once a day and see if you feel movement..I'm sure everything is okay...Good luck|`|DLDweOcYaa	So you mean that you can't feel your baby move or kick?  If this is your 1st baby then you don't know what it feels like so it's common to think that you haven't felt your baby.  I'm sure your baby is moving and kicking around in your belly.  If you have any concerns then see your doctor.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	What are you talking about? Does your baby hate you? I have no idea what you are even saying?!?<br>  <br>  Your baby has no capacity of emotion at the moment.
eytlIKITaa	They make special barbells for pregnant bellies now!  So you don't have to let it close up!<br>  <br>  Try bodycandy.com- they're only $6 there!|`|be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	Depending on your frame, and I am assuming your small enough to have a belly button ring, you may not even have to take it out until it becomes uncomfortable for you. Your doc can advise your further on that. I do know a girl, who was very very small, like underweight small, and she had hers pierced when got pregnant with her first. She didn't take her's out until she was like 7 months or so, and when she did it, she pulled up on the skin to do it, and it caused a stretch mark instantly. That was the only stretch mark she got too.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	You take it out when it starts to bother you. Thats what my OB told me and that what I did, I took it out at like 30 weeks. It got itchy and started to pull a bit. No, it didn't close back up, though I did get some weird stretch marks around it, kinda in a circular pattern....|`|KRoSwO6iaa	you can buy plastic maternity bars, that stretch with you, get one if you don't want to take it out, my cousin has had hers in all the way through.|`|PLgNsOF9aa	I dont think your belly ring is going to affect anyone but you. Later in pregnancy when you are great big and poofed out it will rake against your clothes or just look funny thru ur cotton shirts.|`|whYlVR2saa	well, i heard that some women can leave it in there until around 6 months when they really start to feel the pains of their stretching body. i also have my belly button pierced, i took it out for a few months and they ended up going through ok, i have had it pierced for a few years now. i would suggest if you would like it to stay open for after your pregnancy that you start removing it for a day or two and then replacing it for a day or two. that is how i got mine to stay open after so long of being out. it sounds complicated, i know, but if it is important to you then you can try it. good luck!|`|ox6SXta4aa	I am a little shocked by the answers on here.  I am 5'2 and am 16 weeks in to baby three - I have NEVER taken my piercing out during pregnancy and it never bothered me.  With my first the skin around the hole got a little dark but went away very quickly after birth. With the second I never got the dark pigment and the hole isn't stretched to where it looks strange or anything.  I guess it just goes to show that everyone is different.  How they pierced it (how much skin was pierced / how much room you have on the bar) may have something to do with it.|`|LTCB69fZaa	i am 13 weeks pregnant and i still have mine in i guess it really depends on when your stomach starts to get bigger due to the fact that you wouldn't want your skin to rip i have had mine since 07 and i'm just replacing the metal one with a pregnancy belly button ring oh and by the way yes it will close up|`|6bIdcRVkaa	You will definitely have to take it out once your belly gets big, but that shouldn't be for awhile. If you're afraid that it will close up and don't want that happening, they make certain belly rings for pregnant women.|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	It will close up and take it out asap or it will just turn into a big whole that will never go back to normal!! Just get it repierced after the baby if you want it that bad.|`|6C4ibyF8aa	you can get a retainer for your belly peircing. i got mine done in february 08, and i took it out september 08. mine hasn't closed up|`|1lgKBfTlaa	My sister N law had hers in the whole time she never took it out cause it never bothered her so it is pretty much on how you feel...|`|sycgY17taa	They have flexible belly rings.  I got mine off ebay for a couple bucks.|`|z198dj4Baa	im 27 weeks and took mine out at like 20 weeks cuz i streched soo much and it started to hurt i think mine is closed now|`|hJoB7VR1aa	My sister had her belly button pierced at took it out at 10 wks. It may or may not close up. I can tell you that you belly button is going to look really strange when you get bigger. My sister's hole stretched out and got really big, looked like when people put the stretchers in their ears.
VT24zOomaa	as long as the baby is healthy, there is no such thing as a belly being to big or to small. i looked like that around 29 weeks.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=174526141&albumID=1760717&imageID=30633962" rel="nofollow">http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...</a><br>  that's me at 30<br>  <br>  now i'm 38 and i grew A LOT!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=174526141&albumID=1760717&imageID=31832015" rel="nofollow">http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...</a><br>  that's me at 37 1/2 weeks.<br>  <br>  everyone is different.<br>  <br>  i'm also having a girl!!|`|DRb4Qlypaa	please do not listen to people when they tell you something is wrong. Unless they are YOUR doctor and they have your chart in their hand, then they do not know what they are talking about. People try to give unwelcome advice alot during pregnancy. The best way to deal with it is just to say "Well, I usually just follow my doctor's advice, but thank you anyway". People will leave you alone after that. <br>  If the doctor has not said something was wrong, then nothing is wrong. They should be measuring your belly every time you go and they would have said if something was out of the ordinary.|`|BZiZr4Hcaa	That's how mine looks but and I'm 17 weeks, however! this is my 2nd kid so they say it shows much faster because the muscles are not as tight. With my first one I didn't show AT ALL until I was 5months, I got a "pouch" then. So every pregnancy is different and every woman is different. Don't worry and don't think anything of it, you're baby will be a cute, healthy baby girl! congrats :)|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	You are absolutely fine.  Us tall girls are going to carry our babies differently than someone who is only 5 feet tall.|`|8WbfmK5daa	No not at all. Im 39 weeks and my bump only measures 34 weeks but at my last growth scan they estimated she will be about 6 1/2lb when she is born which isn't too small. So even if your bump is small it  doesn't mean your little girl is or isn't growing properly. <br>  <br>  Good Luck when she puts in an appearance :)|`|ca9dEvSAaa	You are 6 foot tall, and that is a factor in how you carry. You are not to small for 30 weeks. Being too small means your fundal height is off. Trust me you will know|`|DVHfPdWIaa	you can get your curves back<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/healthy-pregnancy" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/healthy-pregnanc...</a>|`|xMy0QEvFaa	I'm 27w4d and your a little bigger than me, but remember every pregnancy is different.<br>  <br>  You do know when you get bigger you have to take out your belly button rings right?|`|17GuqtQ9aa	look all pregnant women r different, iam nearly 36 weeks now and my belly still small, i was worried b4 , but is must important ur baby is healthy|`|UgX3gUSJaa	U r pretty small for 29w3d. It does make since why ur belly isnt as big because shes growing down by waist. Congrats!!!!|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I don't think so, I am due May 8 and I am having a girl. As my husband said last night your belly looks like a watermelon, I am low and fuller on the sides. Your belly looks a lot like mine.|`|TljXiSNnaa	no not at all i dont think soooo but does those peircings hurt??? thats the question lol. i had to take mine out a whil ago and im only 15 weeks
a1x0xqARaa	I heard that whether the baby gets an "innie" or an "outie" depends upon the way the cord is cut after birth.  I don't know how accurate that is, that's just what I've heard.  My son has an "innie" and so do I.<br>  <br>  And yes, your "outie" will go back in.  It's just an "outie" right now because of the stretching skin.  My belly button is just like it was before I was pregnant.|`|96e708000337d2c8bf93e36846c7b5a6aa	What kind of answers are these??!!  The babies belly button is determined by how the doctor cuts the umbilical cord?  Apparently you've never had a child!<br>  <br>  Your belly button will return to normal after birth.  There is no making sure that the baby has an innie.  The doctor (or father depending on your doctor) will cut the umbilical cord about an inch from the belly and clamp it.  Keep it clean and after about a week, it will fall off (kind of like a scab over a wound).  Where it falls off is where his/her belly button will be.|`|6Szm2sXlaa	Yes your belly button will go back in after the birth<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  if you want your son 2 have a innie than tell your doctor and he will cut it to make it a innie|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	Your outie will go back in after burp because it is common for a woman's belly button to "pop" while pregnant...|`|0vpDDM8aaa	the outie will go back in after you give birth :o)  the baby's belly button is determined by how the doctor cuts the ambilical cord.|`|UcgWrGaAaa	I'm not sure, but the posters who say it's the way the doc cuts it are wrong, they leave an inch or 2 of cord when they cut so that has nothing to do with it.<br>  <br>  I have an innie and my hubby has an innie and our kids have innies so I'm going to guess it is genetic.|`|seU9VwIJaa	The only thing that determines the belly button is where they cut the umbilical cord. Yes, once the baby is born your belly button will go back to normal.<br>  Congrats and good luck!
sBHhnDwaaa	About 15... And I'm down 20 lbs. Wohoo. Lol.|`|PLgNsOF9aa	You lose quite a bit with the actual baby plus the water weight comes off too.

GE9dgLXKaa	You could be.  I remember when I breastfed my little girl I did not get a period for 8 months after she was born. With that being said you are very irregular.  Also I do know that they tell you not to have unprotected sex while breastfeeding because you are very fertile.  I guess it could go either way.  Go ahead and take a test you never know.|`|YfTwfeGIaa	There's always a chance to get pregnant, even while exclusively BFing. If you're unsure, my only suggestion is to test.|`|2n0B4cY6aa	i did not know that but yes there is still chance you pregnant so id go have a test|`|TyjAcOQ7aa	YES YEP YEPPERS YIPPEE YA YAY HOORAY BOOYA!!!!!!|`|ns1F0p8Laa	Try a test but it sounds like you could be pregnant.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i got preggo with BF but he was planned  My girl wsa 15 months take a test Even if your preiod is gone do to BF or still weird good luck|`|IdWleKAyaa	lol Sorry it does sound like you could be pregnant I concieved when my daughter was 3mths old and I was strictly breasfeeding her as well.<br>  I guess we are just more fertile then most. take a test.<br>  But yes I think you are pregnant<br>  Good luck|`|jf4UOCElaa	yep your are your more likely to get pregnant while bestfeeding i dont know while perhaps cause your hormones are still very strong|`|aJjV5b95aa	It is possible you should take a HPT.|`|0yZhygM1aa	yes
FXINmF6saa	I don't think your going into labor but if it's getting worse you should probably go to the doctor. But to treat the diarrhea maybe try solids and food that you know is good to treat it. Labor feels completely different what I think is your stomach is cramping because you don't have food in your tummy and you keep forcing more and more to come out. It's kind of like when you've got non-stop vomiting, eventually when you've got nothing else to throw up your stomach starts to cramp. It's the same thing, I wouldn't worry so much.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You would know if you were in active labor. Just hang in there and wait to hear back from your doctor.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	I don't think you're in labor.  The signs aren't there, but everything you put in you goes to your baby and no matter how much doctors fight it, there has been nothing proven to be safe while pregnant|`|a1x0xqARaa	I would call your doctor again.  Insist you speak with your doctor.  Or march right into the office yourself.  Is your baby still moving inside you?  Chances are, if the baby is still moving, the baby is fine.  No damage to the baby.  But being 33 weeks along, anything is possible at this stage!  So I would either insist speaking with your doctor on the phone, or going in yourself to see.  The doctor could do an exam to make sure things are okay.|`|nyiSlDjRaa	stomach cramping is a reaction to a lot of medication, so i would say that is probably what it is. <br>  i had stomach cramping so bad once that i thought i was in labor and i wasn't even pregnant. ; )<br>  <br>  but seriously, only your doctor can only know for sure! she should call you back sooner than over 2 hours!|`|jf4UOCElaa	you may be hives can trigger things like that
3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	Cucumbers are my favorite snack!!! I have not tried them with lime juice though... I am going to do that right now.

SrRafsqraa	Well just having my first child a little over 4 months ago, I passed alot of stuff off  during my pregnancy because I had never experienced it before.  The day I went into labor, I just thought I had a REALLY bad tummy ache.  Here comes the TMI part--it literally felt like I was going to throw up and had to go number 2 at the same time--the worst stomach pain combination and it came every two minutes.  My husband finally talked me into going to the hospital and I threw up right before we got in the car.  If you feel like something is wrong or you are in a different kind of pain that you aren't so sure about then go to the hospital--they will either send you home or say your ready to deliver!|`|3EhoJ42zaa	It's hard to say.  The lower back pain and menstrual cramps could be from baby lowering further causing your pelvis to spread and will give you discomfort in the lower back, pelvis, hip bones, inner thighs, etc...  Or it could be the start of early labor.  It's hard to tell until your contractions start becoming either more painful or consistent.  Till then it can still just be regular pregnancy aches and pains.  Go walk for an hour, then take a 15-20 minute break, walk for another hour, take another break, and continue that.  The day I went into labor I walked for an hour then would take a break, by my third walk I was timing contractions.|`|sLkruqYVaa	so you ve lost the mucous plug(sorry) but that can happen a week befor you go into  labour but it does sound to me like you re in slow labour,  u will know when the "real" contractions come along i wouldn t rush to hospital just yet but i would have your bag and husband on standby just in case|`|IdWleKAyaa	Menstural cramps are an early sign of labor but they may last for days as they slowly prepare your body for labor...your bady is getting ready for the big day<br>  So in its time your Baby will be here!<br>  Good luck|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Those are still braxton hicks, but be patient and don't worry.  You're almost there.  When your baby's lungs have fully developed, baby will let out a hormone that sends you into labor.  It is the same hormone that brings in your milk and allows the bond with your baby.  When it happens, make sure that you allow yourself to labor naturally, if they try to "speed things up" by inducing you it will generally stop the natural hormone an make nursing and bonding harder.  I suggest that you stay home and labor until they are a steady 3 minutes apart before going to the hospital, and try to do it without pain meds as they are all narcotics and a sister to heroine, and yes, baby gets them too.  Good luck and God bless|`|gZoljE7Saa	I feel ya I am 39 weeks too. It could be. I also am hoping every little pain is labor.  Maybe if we wish hard enough together are babies will just come today! ;0)
QMxEjCpiaa	They can typically have any disorder - typically not a disease. The mother pass an infection off to the baby but can also transfer AIDS, HIV, and other life threatening diseases like that. But with a mother taking illegal drugs and smoking, the baby can be premature and low birth weight. Either one of those can cause serious problems. <br>  <br>  Mostly a mother who is taking illegal drugs along with smoking and alchol, the baby can be practically brain dead when born. I work with an individual who's mother drank heavily thru her pregnancy causing the baby to have Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. It's something I truly have never seen before. The individual constantly flaps her hands, spits on the floor, shakes, rubs her shoulders on the walls when she walks, and if she hits something (that's sticking out from the wall), she keeps moving as if she didn't hit it. A few times she actually required several stitches since she hurt herself that badly. <br>  <br>  Imagine a drunk puppy, that's pretty much what she was like.|`|8OoqHpbIaa	im not 100 percent sure<br>  <br>  but i knew a girl who took speed when she was pregnant the baby only weighed 5lb and had to be in a incubator also the baby had a oversized head<br>  <br>  smoking can cause premature birth and low birth weight also can increase the babies chances of  having SIDS sudden infant death syndrome|`|DVHfPdWIaa	If a mother smokes during pregnancy then babies born to them  have lower average birth weight, have hormonal disorders, can be born without limbs, have greater risk of sudden infant death then those of non-smoker mothers. Smoking during pregnancy can create complications which may lead to emergency delivery and sometimes baby born prematurely (before 9 months).<br>  <br>  read this article for more information<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/healthy-pregnancy" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/healthy-pregnanc...</a>|`|oaGG4soGaa	Smoking During pregnancy is being incredibly selfish.<br>  it deprives your baby of oxygen and so can be born with severe weight loss and a very high risk of heart disease.<br>  If you feel you cannot quit smoking or stop taking drugs then i advise you not to damage a human life. <br>  Angie x|`|IdWleKAyaa	when the mom smokes baby could be small or develop asthma or baby could die of SIDS (sudden infant death) if mom does drugs baby could have mental delays, stomach problems and could be born with an addition to the drugs<br>  either way both smoking and drugs are bad for baby
P7tue78Aaa	I also had a food aversion to meat but it went away after awhile.

When they checked my iron levels I was perfect. Broccoli is full of so many nutrients and so good for you!|`|DVHfPdWIaa	fibre, protein and vitamins with supplements.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/healthy-pregnancy" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/healthy-pregnanc...</a>|`|YfTwfeGIaa	Peanut butter! LOL I know how you feel. I had really bad food aversions with my first child. Thank God it didn't last the whole time.
3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	Antibiotics stay in your system about 10 days, so if you don't want to risk getting pregnant, use another form of contraception...|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Don't make yourself suffer! LOL Just use a condom :)|`|t4HXotwEaa	it's most likely fine.  however, if it would make you feel better use a condom.|`|z198dj4Baa	i was on birth control and  i was on antibiotics soo i didnt have sex till i was done and still ended up pregnant. i would be careful|`|cP0NnP6Oaa	im was on that same bc...its not effective until the end of month 2. so i hope you all were using condoms too. and yes it can still interfere with you bc.
a1x0xqARaa	I would tell him just how you stated it in your question.  My son's dad and I have been through hard times.  And while I wanted so much to just take our son out of his life, I ultimately couldn't do it.  If you do that, then the child is the one who suffers.  Seeing mommy and daddy fight is no fun for anyone.  You can't force him to be in the baby's life (know that from experience).  All you can really do is put it out there and leave it alone.  He'll come around when he's ready.  My ex did.  As for how to word the letter, like I said before, word it like you did in your question.  From your heart.|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	Basically, you should include in this letter how the pregnancy has been for you so far. If you do not want to be with him, but have him involved with the baby, make sure that you do not put too many of your own feelings in it. Maybe when you send him the picture, he will have a change of heart and see what the two of you have created.|`|sycgY17taa	I don't see nothing wrong with what you wrote here.  Do you think you have it in you to invite him to the ultrasound?|`|eya1WDS4aa	this is what i have come up with.<br>  <br>  Dear_____<br>  <br>       I know its been a while since we have last talked and im glad we both had that time to cool off and calm down. i wanted to get together sometime with you and talk. i would really like you to be involved in our childs life. I want to do whats best for our baby and you being in his/her life would be best. i was wondering if you could contact me with a good time and date to get together and talk about this. thank you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Your really need to talk to him in person about this and not over a letter which is why i wrote in there get together with a time and date to talk. Good luck and i hope this helps.|`|DxoodgOtaa	heres what i would write:<br>  <br>  Hi (insert name here). How are you? I know you probably are still upset with me after what happened, but I'm happy to see you're reading my letter. I had an ultrasound, and I enclosed a copy of it for you to see your child. Even though I don't want to pursue a relationship with you anymore, I would really like it if you were involved with this baby. I want to be mature and do the best thing for him/her, and I think having his/her father around would be one of the best things. I'm really sorry about what happened, and I hope you can forgive me enough for the sake of our child. I'm not trying to pressure you, but I know you want what's best, and this is what's best in my opinion. Please let me know. Hope all is well. Sincerely, (insert your name here).
ocEoqh3Saa	It sounds like you have all the symptoms of being pregnant. The best way to take a pregnancy test is with the first urine of the day. You should go to the store and get another test like First Response and take it. If it still comes out negative you should go to the doctor and take a blood test to be 100% sure your not pregnant.|`|6C4ibyF8aa	yes take another test! look VERY closely to the pregnancy tests, there may be a positive line there that you can barely see! if there is any positive line AT ALL then the test is coming back positive. good luck!|`|ihL0FkJYaa	It sounds like you have all the symptoms of being pregnant. The best way to take a pregnancy test is with the first urine of the day
1YdeUn1Caa	My Dr. told me not to quit. Quitting causes stress and will harm the<br>  baby. So I cut back to 5-7 a day. The result. 3 pregnancies, 3 big<br>  and healthy babies. All because I listened to my Dr. His advice<br>  benefited my children.|`|ftvxAS3saa	MY BABY IS HEALTHY!!!! I SMOKED 4 MONTHS AN IM 5 MOTNHS NOW I SMOKED A COUPLE CIGGS IN THE PAST 3 DAYS. I GET WORRIED BUT EVERYBODY IS NOT PERFECT, ITS WHAT U THINK IS RIGHT AN WRONG, SMOKE OCCASIALOLY I KNOW ONCE I POP THE BABY OUT I WILL SMOKE A NICE BIG PACK OF COWBOY KILLERS LOL .. IF U WANT TO SMOKE GO A HEAD BUT NO MORE THEN 3 A DAY!!|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	Anything that goes into you, goes into your baby. So even that one cigarette is STILL going into your baby. ANY smoking in pregnancy is not 'okay'.|`|DutTBV3caa	no its not ok. both of my little brother were born extremely early and almost died because their mother couldnt stop smoking for 9months. <br>  take your babys health in consideration.<br>  <a href="http://www.babytobee.com/articles/Pregnancy-and-Smoking-.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.babytobee.com/articles/Pregna...</a>|`|W1p6LetFaa	I won't say that it's "okay" to smoke while pregnant, but the less you smoke, the better.  So yes, you are on the right track by only smoking one cigarette or half of one a day. I know how hard it is to quit!  Keep up the good work for your baby!|`|96HWpdkFaa	It's not a good idea to smoke when pregnant..it can cause a higher risk for misscarige. I understand that it's hard to quit so try your best to cut down and quit. Good Luck! It'll be worth it for your little bundle of joy!|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	eww!!|`|AA11987492	I commend your honesty. While it is never "good" to smoke while pregnant, it is not a good idea to quit cold turkey either. That will put your baby into withdraws and that puts the baby under stress, which is not good. I smoked during my early pregnancy because I did not know I was pregnant until I was 11 weeks along. I quit as soon as I found out and I have a BIG, happy, healthy, boy.<br>  <br>  My recommendation to you is to quit very soon. It IS important that you quit, but be sure that you cut down first. Talk to your OBGYN, S/he will be able to help you work out a plan to stop smoking.<br>  <br>  Congratulations!|`|zBz10IiOaa	although smoking is bad for you while pregnant but i am almost 6 months pregnant i do smoke i do not smoke alot about4 a day and i don't care if i get thumbs down my dr knows it and so does everyone else.i don't see very much harm as long as it is less then a half a pack a day!!! so i,m not going to shoot you down,<br>  a little insight my son is perfectly healthy so <br>  people need to quit preaching  about everything bad that's going to happen or could happen!<br>  \<br>  <br>  UM TO THE GIRL UNDER ME YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL  SMOKING DOES NOT!! CAUSE DOWN SYNDROME  CHROMISOME DEFECTS DO!!|`|FXINmF6saa	No you really shouldn't be smoking at all. If drinking even a sip of wine could damage your baby's developement imagine the harm your baby's inhaling. Try to quit asap before anymore harm is done.|`|8mchLCQhaa	No it is never ok to smoke especially while pregnant.|`|DxoodgOtaa	its prolly not good for the baby, even as small as he/she is.<br>  but best of luck on quitting, i hope everything turns out ok. (:|`|EXhVHMAlaa	No, it's not okay.<br>  Don't risk your baby's health for the cigarette.<br>  Stop to be safe.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	what's the point in smoking one a day...why not just stop<br>  <br>  unless u're ok with cancerous smoke travelling through your unborn child?<br>  <br>  i stopped as soon as i got a positive test|`|YG2QMTQ2aa	Not being rude, but I must tell you everytime at preconceptional counselling one is urged to quit smoking as it is more dangerous than taking alcohol for both pregnant lady and fetus. Please see here <a href="http://dr-healthguide.blogspot.com/2009/02/preconceptional-counselling-and-care.html" rel="nofollow">http://dr-healthguide.blogspot.com/2009/...</a>|`|nV7At9cfaa	im not encouraging smoking while pregnant but i have had a few friends who have smoked thru there entire pregnancy, there is always a chance of birth defects, but no one i know has had them, i also know that you should not cut off cold turkey for not only you having bad withdrawls so might the baby, so ease yourself off of them. now im not a dr. and i dont have kids this is just what my friends who smoke that have babies say.|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	My mom just had a baby (and I am 23 years old and pregnant, it's pretty funny) and she had smoked the whole pregnancy when she was having me and i turned out fine. She smoked the whole pregnancy with my baby sister and my sister is fine. She did not smoke more than 3 cigarettes a day, but congrats on trying to quit! Don't let others rip you apart. It's not like you are smoking a pack a day. Good luck with the quitting!|`|OvnhxLiaaa	um...your willing to risk your baby's health along with the chance of loosing the baby! Smoking while pregnant can have detrimental long term affects. My cousin smoked while she was pregnant and her son is now 20 and he has had downsyndrome his entire life. He has to go to a special school and has no chances of living a completely normal life.He has hearing problems, along with other problems. You are such *** hole!|`|2DM7MaXyaa	Smoking or being around it is not good for the baby at all.. but smoking one is a lot better than smoking a pack a day. just try to wean yourself off of them soon... good luck and congrats..|`|6C4ibyF8aa	no it's not ok, even though it might be hard just try your hardest to stop. good luck and congrats!|`|lrkfInB3aa	gasp!
AA11903503	I would start out with 10-12 diapers, that would get you through a full day on the weekends.<br>  The BG one size are very nice, they come with 2 soakers so you can double up at night. However I would recommend buying a few different types (buy on clearance to see if you like others).<br>  You change them the same as you would a disposable, when they are dirty. Flannel wipes are also very easy to use (and you can easily make them with a sewing machine and an old flannel sheet to save money). We use a little squirt bottle next to the wipe to get them moist.<br>  You might be able to actually use them at the daycare, speak with the director and staff. Once you can show them how it's as simple as a disposable for them they might be willing to do it.<br>  I do really like the bumGenius (BG), but I also use other brands and ones that I sewed myself. Thirsties have a very nice all-in-one, most are all very good it just becomes a matter of personal preference.<br>  Cleaning is a breeze. I use a dry bucket (no rinsing or soaking). All the diapers go in a cold rinse and spin, then a hot wash with about 1/4 the regular amount of laundry detergent (too much detergent can cause build-up and the diapers my not work as well), lastly its off to the dryer.<br>  Any website that sells cloth diapers have cleaning instructions and other tips.<br>  Oh, yes... No bleach or fabric softener. Bleach breaks down the fibers over time and fabric softener makes them less absorbant. The material BG and others are made of are plenty soft and there is no need for softeners.|`|4LsF70cjaa	Kudos to you!  I had to use cloth on all three of mine because they were allergic to the plastic outer pant.  I don't know about sizes, I bought long ones that I could fold to size, but one thing that kept them snowy white was that I basically washed them twice.  With bleach only in the first wash cycle, then add detergent and let it run through the whole cycle, then I would start the machine again, add fabric softener only, then let it rinse the softener out also.  Nice, soft, white diapers with virtually no residue to irritate baby's skin.|`|WWdgyvU9aa	I always recommend starting out with a stash of 24 diapers. This way even if you're using them all day you will only have to wash them every other day. Yes, you change the diapers and the liners when they are soiled. Keep a pail filled with water and baking soda or water and white vinegar on hand to toss soiled diapers in. Diapers that have poop on them can be swished around in the toilet and flushed before being tossed in the pail. When it's washing time, you can usually wash them in warm or hot water with an extra rinse cycle, using white vinegar instead of fabric softener (which will help prevent soap build up on your diapers and neutralize odors). Your diapers will come with care instructions, so it's really best to follow those.
AA11327039	Do you remember the exact date you had the sex that conceived this child?  Do you remember the exact date you ovulated?<br>  <br>  Write both dates down on the calendar.<br>  <br>  Now, if the date of sex occurred, the day before, on, or after the date of ovulation you're having a boy.<br>  <br>  If the date the sex occurred three days before (or more) ovulation you're having a girl.<br>  <br>  Reasoning.......girl sperm live longer in the girl body.  Boy sperm swim faster but die sooner........<br>  <br>  OR another theory........was it YOU wanting sex the night you conceived or was it your HUSBAND.  If he wanted the sex, then it's a boy....if you wanted the sex then it's a girl.|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	Well, the last girl (until recently) born in my family was my 20 year old sister. My auntie had 3 boys after her, both myself and 2 of my cousins had 3 boys each... That's a lot of boys. Until about 8 months ago when 2 of my other cousins, both their first babies, had a girl each! They seem to have broken the 'boy only' thing that was going on!<br>  <br>  It sounds like there are a lot of girls in your family but remember the sex of your baby is determined by your husbands sperm!|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Your chances are still 50% because it is the babys daddy who determines if its a boy or a girl.<br>  Only 6 more days....you'll just have to wait it out! Good luck|`|i3pn4jNcaa	well are you due in 6 more days or ultrasound to find out? girls are more likely than boys.|`|gBEq0zo5aa	Did you have morning sickness?- all my friends who had morning sickness had girls. I didn't and I had a boy. None of my friends who had boys had morning sickness. Also, sex is determined by the sperm so you'd want to go by your husband's family not your own- and it sounds like they are pretty even! Some other things- if you look like your carrying a basketball and your weight is all in front it's a boy, if the weight is spreading across your hips it's a girl.  But all in all I've found the morning sickness thing to be very true (with like 20 people!) Good Luck and Congrats!|`|lqLzULXEaa	Your side of the family does not matter at all your husband has the gene that decides boy or girl if he has more boys on his family then you will most likely have a boy and if he has more girls in his family then it will most likely be a girl.<br>  <br>  <br>  Blinks back is so wrong you are more likely to have a boy then a girl, girls are more rare believe it or not!|`|dd5d0f065b45c14a02d51f88fefe773eaa	Lets see. I have 4 sisters and 2 brothers. My mom has 2 sisters, my nana has 5 sisters and 1 brother, my grandaddy has 3 sisters and 2 brothers and on my dad's side he has 1 brother, his mom has 1 sister and my granddad is an only child.  My husband has 2 brothers. His mom has 3 brothers, his nannie has 1 brother and his granddad has 2 brothers. His dad has 5 brothers and 1 sister....Together he and I have 3 sons. Out of our family there are a grand total of 23 girls and 27 boys!!! The chances look pretty close to 50/50 to me!! LOL!!|`|GUUgeptjaa	Well since it totally depends on the dad and a lot of factors including diet (which is actually true)  it sounds like that it could go either way honestly.  But i'm going to guess a boy, as a lot of women who's family only have boys the man ends up with all girls and vice versa and since there are more girls, I am thinking you will have a boy,lol|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	I was the same way you are until I found out what I am having. The guy picks what the sex is with the whole xx/xy chromosome so it really doesn't matter what is on your side. My husband's side it seems that his brothers have the girl children and his sister has the three boys... I am having a girl. Good luck!|`|jf4UOCElaa	for some reason the mens genes are stronger but your chances are fifty/fifty i think your having a boy tell me wats happens|`|aNrjfpyaaa	hmmmm thats tough, Im just counting down the days till I can find out, this waiting is the hardest part!|`|ihL0FkJYaa	3/1|`|uxmqgmCCaa	id say 50/50 lol
65f9bf63277a3aad10cb477ed6f41708aa	Hi, I had some of the same issues with my first pregnancy which I lost, and they started again with this pregnancy, I started having the brown discharge at around 6weeks6 days as well, I went to a new Doctor, and she checked my Progesterone levels and put me on Progesterone Suppositories in the mean time until the tests came back and sure enough my levels were really low a 7 when I was 6 weeks 6 days. She said I would for sure lose this baby too if I stopped taking the suppositories. I am so thankful to have found this Doctor. Its just a thought to ask your Doctor to check your progesterone levels. Good Luck, and Congratulations!!|`|8mchLCQhaa	99 is really low! Mine was 120 at 7 weeks!|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	Call your doctor just to make sure. That is what they are paid for is to answer those questions and you would rather be safe than sorry!
OPhMTPqyaa	Test in another week, I have a six and a half month old daughter,<br>  breastfeeding and am now 4 weeks 4 days pregnant so it's very possible to get pregnant while breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and take care|`|ihL0FkJYaa	test again n a week|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	It is possible to be pregnant and still nursing, I know because I'm in that situation. But, that said having weight loss plateau is not a sign, it just does that. I found that my breasts were incredibly sensitive and was nauseated all the time, but not throwing up...I thank nursing for that actually. My cervical mucus changed too. If you're really unsure test again in a few days and make an appointment with your doc. It could be the mini pill making you feel off. If you are in fact pregnant, the doc will schedule a U/S asap to try and figure out how far along you are.|`|AA10766729	It IS possible to become pregnant during BF'ing (a friend of mine had it happen recently).  But since you're also using the minipill -- even with having the occasional miss -- I think your chances are probably pretty low.<br>  <br>  Maybe you're just coming down with something or your suffering the winter blues.  If you don't start feeling better soon, I'd recommend a trip to the doc for a full work-up.  And do take another test in about a week if it would put your mind at ease.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
cjcjRvKdaa	You are fine, just keep taking good care of yourself.  <br>  <br>  I lost 15 lbs in my first trimester with baby 1 and 10 lbs with baby #2 (morning sickness).  I didn't start gaining until I was in my 4th month.  Both of my kids were perfectly healthy and had normal birth weights (7 1/2 lbs and 8 1/2 lbs). <br>  <br>  Don't worry--sounds like you are doing just fine.  Btw, you baby needs very few calories for survival in the first trimester.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DutTBV3caa	well my mother told me that her entire pregnancy with me she lost weight. and i know a woman who ended up losing weight because her morning sickness was so bad she was admitted to the hosp. and they made her drink nasty chocolate flavored thingys (lol) to make her gain weight.  so it might be more common then you think. <br>  as long as youre eating right, and taking care of yourself you'll be ok and your doctor will know what to do to help insure that your babys healthy as well.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	I lost 9 lbs in the first 3 months of my pregnancy.  I didn't start gaining again until week 20.  I don't know if it's normal, but it happened to me.|`|DxoodgOtaa	it sounds normal.<br>  ive heard of pregnancies when the person gains no weight. and the baby ends up ok.|`|6Lz6Kcd8aa	Im 5'5 and i weighed 118 when i found out i was preg and when i saw my dr at 14 weeks i was down to 105 and he said that was normal b/c i was getting sick everyday. When i was 20 weeks and went back to the dr i was up to 120. with in 5 weeks i gained alot.<br>  <br>  Eat normal  stay very active it helps.|`|2DM7MaXyaa	i know ALOT of people that lose weight when they get pregnant. i'd say you should start gaining 1/2 lb a wk soon. if not i would just let your dr know on average what you eat each day and see if maybe you need to eat more or foods with more calories. good luck and congrats..|`|aNrjfpyaaa	Lucky you I gained 6 pounds by then. Loosing weight in the first and early second trimester is very common, and it will catch up to you soon|`|kpXRhoTvaa	It probably means that your anerexic, that sucks....|`|ihL0FkJYaa	a steady weight would be great|`|01vMpHkWaa	i lost 5 pounds in the beginning also because of my morning sickness|`|85Aa4NHsaa	From start to finish I lost 3 pounds.  My son was 9 pounds. Relax.
aNrjfpyaaa	right on I would say bc that's when I got pregnant|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	mine was right on...got pregnant right away....|`|be5076c0b98b495ffe00aade08f96b65aa	Not accurate for me. Those calculators put you into the category of "ovulation 14 days after onset of period". I thought it was set in stone, however I quickly found out not every woman does that every month. The month I got pregnant, after trying for 2 months with online ovulation calculator unsuccessfully, I ended up using an OPK, and realized I was ovulating, that month, a week early. If I would've gone by the online version, I would've missed it by a week. I encourage you to use an OPK, and compare those results to your online results, and see for yourself! Good luck!|`|ihL0FkJYaa	3 weeks|`|KRoSwO6iaa	about five months!
3EhoJ42zaa	Please do not use those pharamcy blood pressure booths.  The doctor will even tell you to avoid those.  Those are very rarely accurate and will cause you to worry.  Next time get a blood pressure cuff or ask the pharmacist if he has one and he can check it for you.  When you tell them what you got at the pharmacy they will tell you go in to get checked and it will probably be a lot lower then that.  <br>  <br>  With my first my blood pressure was 145/102 (doctor checked it) when I was admitted into the hospital.  Stayed for two days and then was put on strict bedrest with blood pressure medication.  Then it got to 155/112 and I was induced.  <br>  <br>  If you start experiencing severe swelling in the hands or face, spotted vision, firecracker vision, dizziness, a headache that will NOT go away with tylenol, severe weight gain, severe abdominal pain, then call the doctor asap.|`|tTh2Q7etaa	160/90 just grab your cell phone and start driving to the hospital because she will tell you to go at least to get checked because those machines aren't always accurate but sometimes they are. and if you have a history of toxemia then you need to go now.|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	I was admitted to triage when I was at 18 weeks with bp of 153/97... I was told anything over 80 as the bottom number is considered high and they typically want to monitor it. You probably will have to at least go to the doctor's office to be monitored if not the hospital but it just a precaution to make sure you and the baby are okay. Good luck.|`|jf4UOCElaa	your blood pressure is kinda high even for being pregnant average is 120/80 so yeah earache is causing your fever but go check it out just in case

Or just wait until Health Class or Sex Ed and they will cover all the bases and make you not so confused.|`|JsEd4H0raa	stop being stupid...|`|NQevY48jaa	They come in the mail. You have to be up early to meet the mailman though, he has to hand you it personally, or it gets thrown in the bin.
