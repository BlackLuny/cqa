hRYwuCFRaa	Principal Williams, trustees, faculty, family, friends and fellow graduates, today is a day to be thankful and to be inspired...<br>  <br>  That's basic... <br>  <br>  and boring.<br>  <br>  The best speeches often open with a joke, an inspirational quote, or a reflection/witty insight. Many people even admit that they had no clue what to say... or open with how they pondered long and hard over what to say. Think about your audience, who would be there and what would resonate the best and start with that. The goal of the speech is to thank, exalt, stimulate to action, motivate, to affect and touch, even to raise to a higher emotional level, and finally to say farewell. <br>  <br>  When I write speeches - I often write the intro last because I don't want to be constrained by it. Your approach may be different. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|jygcvFAMaa	Steps<br>  Make a list of all the people you would like to thank, as well as those who you need to thank (just because you need to thank them doesn't mean you'd like to). You can write the list down on a sheet of paper and leave a few lines of space between each person. Better yet, input the people into a spreadsheet or word processing document so that you can add to your entries and rearrange them.<br>  Write down why you are thanking each person on your list. Just jot down a quick keyword next to each person's name, i.e. catering, inspiration, support, or donations.<br>  Separate the most important people. Determine importance in reference to why you are thanking them. Typically God, your parents, your spouse, or the company that just gave your organization a bundle of money will be near the top. Once you get past the top few it may be quite difficult to rank people's importance, and you don't need to. Just make sure that the most important people will be at the top of the speech so that there is no chance they'll get left out if your speech starts to get a bit too long. If you have your people entered in a spreadsheet or word processing document it will be easy to assign a rank and rearrange people.<br>  Consider how much time you have for your speech. If you don't have a lot of time you may need to make some tradeoffs. Either you can omit some people or you can shorten the amount of detail you give for each person. You may not have to omit people completely. At the end of your speech you can call off their names. '..And thanks to Michael Croon, Tommy Lee, Jesse Heart, and if I forgot anybody else, thanks to you, too!" If you don't have enough people, tell a little more about them than what you jotted down. Elaborate, but don't share more than you would want shared about yourself.<br>  Write an introduction. Open up with something about why you are thanking everyone. Was it an award, a job well done, a meeting, a convention, a special event, or something else? The reason should be obvious. If you'll have plenty of time for your speech, you may want to open with a little story about the lead-up to the event, a brief history of your career, an amusing anecdote, or a quote.<br>  Flesh out the details for each of the most important people. Start from the top of your list and add detail to the keywords you've written. Thus, if one of your entries is "John Smith--Event Coordinator," you can explain how much work John put into the event and how John has always come through for you in a clutch. For the most important people on your list, your parents, your spouse, your manager or your boss, for example, you may want to add more detail: tell a little story about the person, briefly summarize the time you've known them, or drop an inside joke.<br>  <br>  The most important people should get more air-time than those further down your list. Not only do you have more to thank them for, but you also probably have to live or work with them on a regular basis, so you want to build as much goodwill as possible.<br>  Budget your time for each person. Remember that if you spend too much time on any one person, you may not be able to get to others who still really need to be thanked. Be concise, even if you have plenty of time.<br>  If your speech needs to be really short, you may just say something to the effect of, "I would like to thank Charley, my wonderful husband for supporting me through the long nights. I couldn't have done it without you. Thanks to my beautiful daughters, Kiera and Emily. Mommy can play more now. To Jeff Goldstein of Caracas for feeding my crew, to Jake, Mindy, Paul, and Gwen for staying up so late with me so we could get it right..." You may want to say more about these important people, but if you're pressed for time, they'll understand.<br>  Group the remaining people by their keywords. You'll only be able to make short mention of the rest of the people, and if there are a lot of them, you'll want to organize them. So, for example, you might say, "And for the catering, thanks to Joe, Mike, Mindy, and Jeanette."<br>  Time your speech. Your now-completed speech should begin with an introduction, proceed to the most important people, and then run through the rest of the people in categories. Read the speech at a normal pace, and use a stop watch to time yourself. If you find that your speech is too long, consider shortening or omitting some of the details about people or dropping some of the least important people. If you need to omit someone altogether, try to make sure it's someone who won't be there and won't see the speech. If your speech is too short, add details or add a conclusion.<br>  Write your speech on note cards or on a piece of paper. You can write out your whole speech or just an outline of people and reasons for thanks, whatever helps you remember what you need to say.<br>  Practice in the mirror or in front of a close friend or family member. Do it more than once and make sure you say it out loud before you actually give your speech.

In banbury, the rates go from ￡80 to ￡120 a day for semi-skilled labour, before expenses assuming the person is self employed. Legislation is changing as regards who is allowed to be self employed in the construction industry, so it could be worth looking into that before making any decisions.<br>  <br>  Whichever way you want to jump, an apprenticeship will stand you in good stead - the bloke you work for will give you time to go to college, and you will be able to prove you are not a cowboy when necessary as you will be 'time served'.<br>  <br>  Plumbers are currently receiving the larger fees, but as with any profession, this may vary at a later date. Until relatively recently, carpet fitters were making the big money.<br>  <br>  But, and there is always a but, the fellahs making the good money are the ones who get more done, meaning they have to be fast as well as good, and maybe work long hours, which tends to point to the younger guys getting the cash. Unless you become Corgi registered, an expensive process, when being a plumber with gas expertise means raking it in over a fairly lengthy period and within fairly civilised hours.<br>  <br>  Purely for entertainment value, about twenty years ago accountants were making big money. Most of the plumbers I do work for now earn more than I do.|`|KZ2QjAx7aa	IT DEPENDS MATE!|`|u4hWOZQEaa	All my brothers and dad are in that industry.

6DFhlt4daa	Britannica Concise Encyclopedia: production management<br>  <br>  Planning, implementation, and control of industrial production processes to ensure smooth and efficient operation. Production management techniques are used in both manufacturing and service industries. Production management responsibilities include the traditional "five M's": men and women, machines, methods, materials, and money. Managers are expected to maintain an efficient production process with a workforce that can readily adapt to new equipment and schedules. They may use industrial engineering methods, such as time-and-motion studies, to design efficient work methods. They are responsible for managing both physical (raw) materials and information materials (paperwork or electronic documentation). Of their duties involving money, inventory control is the most important. This involves tracking all component parts, work in process, finished goods, packaging materials, and general supplies. The production cycle requires that sales, financial, engineering, and planning departments exchange information — such as sales forecasts, inventory levels, and budgets — until detailed production orders are dispatched by a production-control division. Managers must also monitor operations to ensure that planned output levels, cost levels, and quality objectives are met.<br>  <br>  Theatrical production management is a sub-division of stagecraft. The production management team (consisting of a production manager and any number of assistants) is responsible for realizing the visions of the producer and the director or choreographer within constraints of technical possibility. This involves coordinating the operations of various production sub-disciplines (scenic, wardrobe, lighting, sound, projection, automation, video, pyrotechnics, stage management, etc.) of the presentation.<br>  <br>  In addition to management and financial skills, a production manager must have detailed knowledge of all production disciplines including a thorough understanding of the interaction of these disciplines during the production process. This may involve dealing with matters ranging from the procurement of staff, materials and services, to freight, customs coordination, telecommunications, labor relations, logistics, information technology, government liaison, venue booking, scheduling, operations management and workplace safety.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/production-management" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/production-...</a><br>  <br>  Business Encyclopedia: Quality Management <br>  <br>  Quality management (QM), also called total quality management (TQM), evolved from many different management practices and improvement processes. Quality management is not specific to managing people, but rather is related to improving the quality of goods and services that are produced in order to satisfy customer demands. Quality management permeates the entire organization as it is being implemented.<br>  <br>  TQM has its roots in the quality movement that has made Japan such a strong force in the world economy. The Japanese philosophy of quality initially emphasized product and performance and only later shifted concern to customer satisfaction.<br>  <br>  Quality management is a method for ensuring that all the activities necessary to design, develop and implement a product or service are effective and efficient with respect to the system and its performance. Quality management can be considered to have three main components: quality control, quality assurance and quality improvement. Quality management is focused not only on product quality, but also the means to achieve it. Quality management therefore uses quality assurance and control of processes as well as products to achieve more consistent quality.<br>  <br>  (more........)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/quality%20management" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/quality%20managem...</a>

fz107eRDaa	The best prep approach depends on a lot of factors. I prepped with both books and a course, and both had value. I now teach LSAT prep classes, and I definitely see exactly what prep courses can do for you. So, I have a lot of thoughts on the matter :)<br>  <br>  There are a couple of questions you have to ask yourself before making a decision on which route to take:<br>  <br>  * Where are you scoring now, and how much do you need to improve? <br>  <br>  * What kind of studier are you? Can you motivate yourself, or does a more structured environment and study plan better suit you?<br>  <br>  * What kind of time do you have for studying on a weekly/monthly basis?<br>  <br>  For the first question, if you haven't already, go to <a href="http://www.LSAT.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.LSAT.com</a> and download the free June 2007 practice LSAT and take it as a timed test. Getting a starting score will help you make some decisions on what method to use when you start studying. Alternatively, you can use one of the practice tests you have. Find a recent one if you can. <br>  <br>  Next, look at some of the average entrance scores for the law schools you are interested in. That data is also available at LSAT.com in the "Official Guide to ABA-Approved Law Schools" section. As you might expect, the scores needed to get into Harvard or Yale will be much higher than the scores to get into, say, Ohio State or Texas Southern. How much you need to improve will probably have a big impact on what study method you choose. <br>  <br>  At that point, you have a few options: self-study with tests and prep books, take a prep class, or get personal tutoring. Books are cheaper but you have to do all the work, and you have to be motivated to study and a good self-learner. Courses are more expensive, but they give you a lot of material and provide a schedule and study plan for you. Tutoring is the most expensive, but it is completely personalized and focused solely on your needs, with someone there to help you at every turn.  <br>  <br>  If you go the book route, these were the three best prep books I used:<br>  <br>  1. PowerScore LSAT Logic Games Bible (<a href="http://www.powerscore.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.powerscore.com</a> )<br>  2. PowerScore LSAT Logical Reasoning Bible<br>  3. Kaplan LSAT 180 (<a href="http://www.kaplan.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.kaplan.com</a> )<br>  <br>  You already have some tests, but if you need more, get them from Law Services (the people who make the test and who are behind <a href="http://www.lsat.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lsat.com</a> ). If you don't have them already, these are the three cheapest ones, each is $30:<br>  <br>  4. The Next 10 Actual, Official LSAT PrepTests <br>  5. 10 More Actual, Official LSAT PrepTests <br>  6. 10 Actual, Official LSAT PrepTests <br>  <br>  If you work through the first three books, you would be in pretty good shape in terms of strategies, and then do a ton of the tests from the second group of books. Try to take at least one test a week if you can. The only real trick to studying is to put in a lot of hours and to take a lot of practice tests. Getting familiar with the test format and your own strengths and weaknesses will make you as comfortable as possible on test day. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you are scoring relatively low, or if a particular section is killing you, strongly consider taking a prep course or getting personal tutoring. <br>  <br>  The main benefits of a class are that:<br>  <br>  A. They lay out the strategies for you so you don't have to figure them out on your own. You also have a source to go to when you have questions or need help. <br>  <br>  B. They provide plenty of study material, and that material is directed in a particular way. <br>  <br>  C. They structure your preparation in a way that self-studying cannot.<br>  <br>  D. You meet other people in the same position you are in, and it helps to have friends who can motivate you to study. <br>  <br>  Do the classes help? Like a lot of things, part of it hinges on whether you put the time in. I took a PowerScore class and I ended up scoring well. I do know that I worked pretty hard, though. Whatever class you choose, find a class that uses a lot of real LSAT's and find out who your instructor will be. Try to get someone with a lot of teaching experience and a high score. Having a good instructor makes a big difference. <br>  <br>  Regardless of what approach you use, you have to study a huge amount of time to lock down a high score. Just be prepared to clear your schedule for it as much as you can.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|P9TZh27xaa	get a studdy book and compare your practice tests to see if they are geting better, if not, then get a tutor|`|fGzuqHfSaa	Powerscore guides are excellent.

AA10053661	Oh sweetie....... I'm so glad to see you, but I'm so sorry it is under these circumstances. <br>  <br>  Ok...... the way i see it, if this administrator is this manipulative and sneaky, you can NOT be the first person he has pulled something like this on. Talk to your co-workers. Being only your second year, you might not know what has happened prior to your hiring. Some of the older teachers will. I can not imagine that he has just decided to pinpoint you for this powerplay. He has to have a history of this. FIND IT!! If you can get someone to speak on your behalf to attest to the fact that this administrator had done such things before, it will greatly help. In addition, your co workers should be eager to speak out on behalf of your performance too. Talk to parents of your students! They are the ones that have reaped the benefits from your teaching. They will be irate to hear of your treatment I'm sure! Parents can be very protective of good teachers. A few good letters to counteract whatever it is he's put in your file will greatly help!<br>  <br>  But I know me..... the first thing I'd do is confront this administrator. Not aggressively....... but you have a valid question. Why were you not made aware of his displeasure with your actions? Why did he compliment you at every turn and never mention improvements? I would think you would have a very valid case. If there is no record of them putting you on an improvement plan...... how can they just terminate you for performance issues? Legally they did not go through the proper procedures to do this. So after talking to him....... if it doesn't go well, I might seek legal advice from an attorney. <br>  <br>  No this isn't fair. At all...... and I know you are not a liar. I'm just so upset for you. I know how excited you were when you were hired and I can't fathom what on earth they would put in a file that would require this action. You seriously need to fight until this is settled. This is your reputation...... your livlihood. No man should tarnish that due to his power play. I know you! You are a great person...... and a fabulous teacher!!<br>  <br>  Please tell me if there is anything I can do to help. Keep in touch!!|`|IamzZ1IXaa	well my friend,<br>   i really don't know what to tell you, i hope that you are able to work things out. since i'm not a teacher or have ever worked for a school<br>  i wouldn't know what to do you help you out.<br>  <br>  i hope you work everything out|`|yAXrsQiFaa	I assume you are a member of a teacher's union.....start there...<br>  <br>  if that has no resources avalible I would find a pit bull attorney quick....<br>  <br>  good luck|`|AA11506028	I not be a teacher, so I know not the politics involved specifically. But the way I look at it.....youre caught in a Catch 22. Even if you were to appeal or go up around or over the superintendent and this asst principal, and did manage to save your job, you would be in uphill fight. Cause from that day on they would both be out to get you. If you want to save that job you have only 1 really viable option. That is to do what the above person said. Talk to others, but try and do it discreetly. Seems like this asst principal may have had it in for you for while. Choose your friends very wisely at this point. And if you do earn a second chance, you must not appear to be afraid of this guy. He will most likely try and do it Again. But you have done beat him down once, make sure that he knows that if you have to you will do it Again. And while youre at it, pray that I will learn how to spell, I had to use spell checker like 37.4 times on this paragraph.|`|ORonhAuvaa	Unfortunately there isn't much you can do as a second year teacher. A lot depends on the county that you are in. Generally speaking teachers cannot be fired for behavior that has been deemed acceptable in the past. However, most second year teachers do not have permanent standing.<br>  <br>  You best bet would be to go to your state's Department of Equal Opportunity to find out if you have a complaint. There is also a federal Equal Opportunity Employment Commission. <br>  <br>  I would also contact the union, even if you are not a member. They can probably give you some advice.<br>  <br>  It would be interesting to know if you felt there was anything wrong with your relationships with other staff. It would have to be a pretty big issue if they are using that as part of the reason to fire you. Did you have any big blow ups or arguments?<br>  <br>  If you really believe you have been wronged, I would get going on filing legal appeals. You may have due process rights that are being violated.

Tuhy5rnQaa	King Henry VIII wanted to divorce his wife so he can marry another person to have a son for a heir. since every child his current wife gave was a daughter and he wanted to keep the family name going and so he asked the pope if he could divorce and as you can he was declined. then king Henry VIII thought if he made his own church and protestant he doesn't have to listen to the pope to divorce and he ended up making the Anglican Church just so he can get married with someone else to have a male heir. Also at the time Anglican church wasn't much different from the catholic churches and if you know some history in England like every king and queen after Henry keep changing religions from catholic to protestant and this made the people of England keep converting after every ruler even if they didn't believe in it. Like the next ruler is Mary and she was catholic and also her mom was the wife that got divorced from Henry and so of course she would be mad at her dad for what he did. Later she gets the title "Bloody Mary" over religious deaths of her people. then Queen Elizabeth comes who was the daughter of the other wife and she was a protestant.

51o7cmJ9aa	The disintegratin of the USSR was because of a combination of many factors---<br>  1. The USSR was stagnating economicalley during this time. The socialist economic setup meant that the state was paying for all the Arms that the USSR bought. It had a huge burden on the state.<br>  <br>  2. There was large scale red tapism and corruption in the country. The state became unaccountable to the people and they refused to support a govenrment that did not give them any political freedom. <br>  <br>  3. The people of USSR had been isolated from the west for a long time.

pSo03Ev8aa	i guess we should have a feeling of respect that she decided the case so well disguised as a judge to save Antonio's life.by the way,i don't know how many trial scenes were there in the whole story,i haven't read it,there was just a scene of it as a literature chapter and it was a trial scene where portia dresses up as a young man of law when Shylock is trying to get Antonio killed.is it that scene.my thoughts here are based on that scene and don't consider this answer if this is not the scene.there was no mention of any ring in the chapter so i doubt whether its the same scene or maybe the people who published my literature reader cut it up or somehting.<br>  ok,so we should have a feeling of respect for her becasue of all those dumb reasons.her presence of mind and cleverness helped to save antonio's lifeshe proved to be a wise and upright judge and did not do any unfair things so that she could save his life.<br>  <br>  personally my feelings on it are far different.i think shakespeare stunk and needed to badly go for english tutoring.its all so confusing and one person just keeps talking and talking and talking in a language so difficult to read.i especially hate the part where portia is praised no end by my teacher,god!my answer is based on all that praise.practically,don't you find shakespearian writings boring and pointless?|`|jygcvFAMaa	i did find but it's hard.<br>  just read this so you can know the answer:<br>  acquitted in the courts of Venice. Graziano and Nerissa begin to argue over the ring with which he promised never to part. Nerissa chastises her husband not for hurting her feelings, but for breaking his own promise. Graziano insists that he gave the ring to a lawyer’s clerk as a fee, and Portia criticizes him for parting with so precious a gift, saying that her own husband would never have parted with his ring. Graziano corrects her and reveals that Bassanio has, in fact, given his ring to the lawyer who saved Antonio. Portia declares that her husband’s heart is as empty as his finger, and she promises never to visit his bed until he produces the ring.<br>   <br>  Bassanio pleads with Portia to understand that he gave the ring to a worthy man to whom he was indebted, but Portia dismisses his reasoning, saying it is more likely that Bassanio gave the ring to another woman. Portia vows to be equally unfaithful, threatening to offer the same worthy man anything she owns, including her body or her husband’s bed. Antonio intercedes on behalf of Bassanio and Graziano, asking the women to accept his soul should either Bassanio or Graziano prove unfaithful again. Portia and Nerissa relent, giving each of their husbands a ring and suggesting that they exercise more care in keeping these rings. Bassanio and Graziano recognize these as the same rings they gave to the lawyer and his clerk, and Portia and Nerissa claim that they lay with the gentlemen in order to get back the rings. Before either Bassanio or Graziano can become too upset at being cuckolded, however, Portia reveals that she was the lawyer in Venice, and Nerissa her clerk. Antonio receives news that some of his ships have miraculously arrived in port, and Lorenzo is told that he will inherit Shylock’s fortune.

With her disguised defense of Antonio at court, and her silly-but-devious ring trick, Portia shows that she's mostly willing to play by the rules, but will have fun interpreting and twisting them to her own pleasure. She can out-think everyone, which helps her to win over the court, deceive Bassanio and Gratiano, and even back her husband into a corner at the end of the play. Her thinking also leads her to some deep thoughts on a variety of issues - some of the more philosophical speeches of the play belong to Portia. Most importantly, she operates within the bounds of the rules of social and legal norms, yet her quick and mischievous thinking allows her to be imaginative within those bounds instead of being oppressed by them.

If you are ready to make a commitment to an online program, look into those which are offered by traditional colleges.

I also have a placement at a Day Care Centre and we fill spray and squirt bottles with paint and water, and then we paint the playground wonderful colours!  If you have no snow then chalk is a great activity or even buckets of water and a paint brush or just a hose, you can create beautiful designs with just water and when it dries you can start all over again!<br>  Again, if you have snow you can build forts, snowmen and make snow angels<br>  If not try making a fort out of sheets and lawn furnature and trees, I used to spend hours playing in sheet forts<br>  How about a bike?  I loved biking as a child<br>  Also going for walks to see different areas of town, we have many different parks, and ponds, you could create a game about going for a hike, walk, hunt etc.<br>  Set up and obstacle course and have him run through it while you time him<br>  Have him set up an obstacle course for you after and let him watch you try it out<br>  Plan a scavenger hunt, place pictures around the yard as clues and he has to go to each spot before he finds the treasure!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, I know how active they can be!|`|ZRsiBwJJaa	4 year olds like to get there hands dirty some ideas can inclue:<br>  <br>  digging in the sandbox for "treasure"<br>  finger paintng<br>  bball<br>  soccer<br>  golf <br>  base ball

It is your responsibility to ask again. Teachers have a lot of students and are constantly getting more papers to grade. Talk to her before or after school.

b46af315c6f44995e526e354e897e976aa	Psychology is regarded as a science, so a degree in psychology would be a B.Sc. ; GCSE Maths is essential in most or all cases because you need to learn to analyse the results of psychological experiments. I did an Access course to get the maths  needed, then majored in Psychology,a mixed degree giving me a B.A. because my split subject was Sociology, considered an Arts subject, not a Science. Hope this helps. good luck.|`|7deb425958c53615415ce326bcbf08e0aa	If you don't have GCSE Maths you will not cope with the maths part of the course.

0xO8Y98uaa	The great thing about creative fields is that your talent speaks for you.  If someone likes a work of art, a song, etc, they aren't going to ask for your qualifications.  Personally, I would rather take lessons from someone who dropped out and has been playing for 30+ years than someone who managed to do all the bookwork for it but has less experience.  Your success in the music world is going to be talent-based.  No one cares about your degree if you suck at it, and no one cares if you don't have one if you're great at it.<br>  <br>  It's a tough field, though, and only the elite can live off it.  Have a fallback.  Best of luck to you, though!

You shouldnt even care what any of the people at your school think. I'm 20 and have been out of high school for 2 and a half years now. I was part of the popular crowd in high school and it was nothing special. All those people are just as self concious as you are they only put you down to make them selves feel better. The friends you make in high school are verry rarely the ones you keep once you graduate. I might talk to one person that i went to high school with and we only speak once a month if that. My advice is to focus on school because that will be your ticket to moving on to bigger and better things. Just remember you can always loose weight but those people cant change there uglieness on the inside.

cMZEmpp0aa	Because the public school system is terrible and private schools often aren't much better. Excellent public and private schools tend to be expensive -- public schools because you have to live in the school's catchment area to attend (and living in a neighborhood with a great school is too expensive for many people) and private schools because they often charge tuition and other fees. There are some families that homeschool for religious or social reasons, but these days I think the majority of homeschools have academic reasons for homeschooling.<br>  <br>  Whether or not a homeschooler takes exams depends on their area's laws and the exams in question. Exams like the SAT and ACT aren't required unless you're applying to a college that requires them, so they're optional for all students. Exams like state-level tests depend on local laws. In New York state, homeschoolers are required to either take those tests or submit an end-of-year progress report. Laws vary in other states, though.<br>  <br>  Whether or not a homeschooler gets a high school diploma depends very much on the method of homeschooling. Students who go through an online or correspondence school might get high school credits and a diploma. Homeschoolers like me who don't go through such a system probably won't get credits or a diploma. But the diploma really isn't all that important in the long run unless you plan on ending your education at the end of high school. Any homeschooler who can prove an ability handle college-level work (there are lots of ways to do that, like good SAT grades or taking college courses while in high school) can go to college and even get scholarships. And really, once you have a college degree, the presence or absence of a high school diploma stops mattering. I think my Master's degree is going to matter more to potential employers than what I did in high school.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	In the Uk, we can't typically walk very far without falling over a school.  Even where I lived in Cumbria, there were decent bus links by school buses to schools in the middle of nowhere (decent for the middle of nowhere anyway).  The schools were typically very good, and a lot of children wanted to go, because their friends, who live closely to them, are going to the same school.<br>  <br>  A lot of people in America are literally miles away from available schooling, or perhaps their local school is in a crime hotspot, and what parent wouldn't consider seriously removing their children from the threat - when a lot of American schools are now using metal detectors to take guns and knives off children as they come in.<br>  <br>  If they follow a national curriculum, then they will be set tests, but they will have to go to a centre to set an exam, as to be fair, most parents would give their children decent marks.  I know I would.  Lol.|`|LsAArkUyaa	According to the numerous homeschoolers on here from the UK, you are wrong about having to go through the the court of law to be able to homeschool.<br>  <br>  What do you mean by .... get taught for nothing?<br>  <br>  ETA: Just wanted to clear up a few inaccuracies in other answers:<br>  The USA does not have a national curriculum<br>  Homeschoolers in the US do not turn in assignments to their local schools. I believe that member is confusing virtual charter schools or homebound schooling with homeschooling.<br>  <br>  EA: Another correction. There isn't a  national law on homeschooling. Those saying that homeschoolers must take a test every yr or making other blanket statements are either speaking of their state laws, or they do not know what they are talking about.<br>  In some state such as TX, the state does not regulate or monitor homeschooling at all.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	I never knew you had to go through court to homeschool in England.  I had actually heard that it was rather easy.<br>  <br>  I guess the U.S.A. is good at one thing-recognizing our rights as parents-the right to raise our children as we see fit (including their education).  We do not want or need the unnecessary burden of the government.  They can not do right in their own schools, they have no right to intrude in ours.<br>  <br>  The laws vary from state to state.  Some require testing, some do not.  All have the opportunity to go to college if they so wish-not sure what other "qualifications" you are referring to.  They do not "just get taught for nothing"-they get taught for education.  The difference is, in the public schools they are taught to regurgitate facts so the public schools get more money.|`|FlVLN3Ehaa	Why are so many homeschooled? Their parents think that is the most suitable choice for their family, that's why. They may or may not do exams, it depends what style of education their parents provide and how much value they put on the qualification. I don't know about you, but my high school qualification isn't worth a thing. It's my transcripts that count. My kids probably won't come out with a formal high school certificate but that doesn't mean they haven't learned anything.|`|BXALhzvtaa	"In England you have to go through the court of law."<br>  <br>  NO YOU DON'T!<br>  <br>  Utterly and totally untrue.|`|9SNLegx0aa	Yes, you're definately wrong about the court of law thing and I've no idea where you got that from. Check out Education Otherwise by searching in google. That'll give you a lot of information on homeschooling in England. <br>  <br>  Regarding the exams, some people take them and others don't. I plan to take at least five GCSE's but probably more. Unfortunately the government is very much set against homeschooling in the UK and I'm not sure about America. In both places though there is no funding. Parents must buy textbooks, pay for exams, etc.<br>  <br>  As someone has already pointed out you don't turn assignments or whatever into a local school whether in England or America, though. <br>  <br>  As for the person who said that homeschooling parents are lazy? They're putting their neck on the line for the sake of their children's future because the government are so against it. They're paying out more financially, dedicating their time to their kids and putting in all the extra work to teach them rather than just doing the obvious and sending them to school where their only responsibility is to get them there so far from being lazy, they're doing far more for their child.<br>  <br>  School can have it's advantages for some children, I'll admit but an awful lot it doesn't have any yet parents are still sending their kids there so even though some parents are doing what's best for the child, lots aren't and I'd call those the lazy parents and not the other way around.|`|R0dyeIRNaa	Because the public system sucks and/or you can't afford it.<br>  Also, the system i am using sends me a program from a school in Baltimore, i get a lesson manual the tells me exactly what to do each day.

You also learn wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy more stuff wen your home schooled.|`|m45R3s5Daa	because the public schools in america are getting worse and worse.<br>  the kids still have to turn in their homework assignments and tests but they do that from home.|`|6fVzzNhiaa	You seem to be mistaken about the ease of parents educating their children at home in England.<br>  <br>  <br>  Department for Children, Schools and Families<br>  Elective Home Education Guidelines for Local Authorities<br>  =====================================<br>  The law relating to elective home education<br>  <br>  2.1 The responsibility for a child’s education rests with their parents. In England, education is compulsory, but school is not.<br>  =====================================<br>  <br>  As for why "so many American children" are homeschooled, maybe because we can.  :)   Parents have many reasons for choosing to homeschool their children.  You can read some of them at:<br>  <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2001/HomeSchool/chara.asp" rel="nofollow">http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2001/HomeSchool/c...</a><br>  <br>  As for sitting exams, some do, some don't.<br>  <br>  As for "a qualification," I'm presuming that would be the equivalent of a high school diploma.  Again, some are presented with a diploma, some just write up CVs and get on with it all.<br>  <br>  As for being "taught for nothing," homeschooling is not an exercise in futility.  Homeschooled grads go on to qualify for jobs, are accepted at university ... and succeed, meet other people, marry -- or not, and live lives as normal as their usually-schooled fellow citizens.

vbfidJlBaa	well you have to convert the twelfths and the eighths to fourty-eighths. then multiply 5 by 6 and 1 by 4. Then add them together.|`|1kOIXVHoaa	Well, the question is not as complicated as it may first appear. All it is really asking is:<br>  Q. What is 5/8 ÷ 1/12?<br>  A. To get the answer, you can go one of two ways. <br>  You can either:<br>  <br>  i) Convert both fractions to have the same denominator, ie express 5/8 in terms of n/12 and then simply solve n/12 ÷ 1/12 .<br>  <br>  To convert 8 into 12, you multiply by 1.5 so 1/8 is the same quantity as 1.5/12<br>  5/8 --> 5x1.5/12 --> 7.5/12<br>  5/8 = 7.5/12<br>  5/8 (of a gallon) = 7.5/12 (of a gallon)<br>  <br>  The jug holds 7.5/12 of a gallon and each cup holds 1/12 of a gallon. Therefore you can fill 7.5 cups from the jug (7.5/12 ÷ 1/12 = 7.5) ;<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  ii) Simply divide 5/8 by 1/12 as you would any other fractions, ie invert the second fraction and divide the sum of the numerators multiplied together by the sum of the denominators multiplied together:<br>  5/8 ÷ 1/12 --><br>  5/8 X 12/1 --><br>  (5X12) ÷ (8X1) --><br>  60 ÷ 8 = 7.5<br>  <br>  Therefore 5/8 ÷ 1/12 = 7.5<br>  <br>  5/8 of a gallon ÷ 1/12 of a gallon = 7.5 <br>  *or* <br>  the capacity of the jug ÷ the capacity of each cup = 7.5<br>  <br>  (@ SingingKitty: why 48? If, as I presume, you (or that fifth grade teacher) wanted to handle whole numbers only, why not convert both denominators to 24? As in 15/24 ÷ 2/24?)

671SwG7Raa	I go to Rutgers and am a comm major!  Usually comm majors are double majors because there really aren't that many credits needed (its only 12 classes and 6 of them are pre-reqs).  Most comm majors take all the public relations courses which are taught by Professor Grasso.  SUPER EASY!  Since you're a great writer you will do fine in these courses.  Some stuff is very abstract like Comm Theory but once you get over those bumps you'll be fine.  Getting into the comm school is very easy too. <br>  <br>  I suggest if you're thinking about the major DEFINITELY get an internship.  You have to go to the department once you're accepted into the school and talk to someone about that.  The more internships you have the more connections you make and the more experience you get.  You will be 1000% better off than everyone else.  Finding a job isn't hard.  If you enjoy pr and marketing you'll be fine.  Everyone I know who is a comm major is wayyy better off than my friends.<br>  <br>  You could also try to get into the business school for marketing.  You will be even MORE better off in this regard, though the business school is HIGHLY competetive.

Calvert is a good one.  I have a friend that has used it for 7th grade with each of her boys.  (She only hs them for 7th grade b/c she considers it an important transitional year.)  Another good one is Abeka.<br>  <br>  I use a variety of curriculum's b/c I didn't feel that one program met all of my ds needs in each subject. (winston grammar, apologia for science and writing, abeka history, a reason for spelling, teaching textbooks for math)<br>  <br>  Consider doing a yahoo groups search for homeschool groups in your area.  I did and the people on the list have been so helpful with any question I ask.<br>  <br>  www.homeschoolreviews.com is a great website for reading reviews by regular people of numerous curriculum's.  Plus, you can then search the websites of the ones you might be interested in to learn more.<br>  <br>  Definitely check out www.hslda.org to find out about hs laws in your state and for a link to a state hs organization which will be invaluable to you as you do your research.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Some good ones:<br>  science:  apologia<br>  math:   teaching textbooks or saxon<br>  writing:  apologia's jump-in or Institute for excellence in writing<br>  history:  abeka, mystery of history<br>  grammar:  abeka, winston grammar<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  PS  Look into your state group for convention information.

NG1a49f3aa	There is no difference between autism and autism spectrum disorder (which is what I think  you meant by autism disorder) except that autism is one part of ASD. Actually, autism is a term that most people use to refer to someone who has ASD. It is called autism SPECTRUM disorder because the symptoms of ASD are not the same in every individual. Technically a person with Aspergers Syndrome is part of the ASD- People with Aspergers can be quite intelligent and even somewhat gifted. They usually exhibit some difficulty with social skills. Typically, when we think of someone with Autism, we are thinking of someone who is severely autistic. They may have difficulty with speaking, more severe difficulty with social interactions, and may suffer from some sort of intellectual disability as well.|`|MB4siWy0aa	As Melissa says, there is no difference.  People like to use different terminology, which just leads to confusion.  Autism is a 'spectrum' disorder, usually involving failure of socialisation, communication, sensory processing and imagination.  All of these can be affected to differing degrees of severity in each child, so that a child at one end of the autistic 'spectrum' can have a totally different set of problems to a child at the other end of the 'spectrum.'<br>  <br>  It's just terminology.  Try not to be worried by it.

xJoMSkI5aa	Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919) was the 26th president of the United States and a proponent of the "New Nationalist" variety of Progressivism. A master of populist rhetoric and public charm, Roosevelt quickly tapped into the widespread fervor for reform.<br>  <br>  Taft supported Teddy Roosevelt's "Square Deal" policy of attempting to strike a balance between employers and employees and conservatives and Progressives, but it soon proved impossible to please everyone. Taft simply did not have Roosevelt's personal charisma. Over time, he wound up satisfying conservatives more often than Progressives. His administration nonetheless pursued more antitrust suits than Roosevelt.<br>  <br>  Wilson was a leading Progressive, arguing for a stronger central government and fighting for anti-trust legislation and labor rights. As president of the United States, he passed important legislation on those and many other issues, narrowly winning reelection in 1916 after pledging to keep America out of World War I.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Progressive Era

63c6ad890d0828ff609c53ea0a1378e0aa	Mr. Duffy lived alone, no pictures on his walls, just the bare necessities, iron bedstead, iron wash stand, table with 4 cane chairs, and a desk on the table, it seemed to me like he took pride in his mean little abode. He did not like excesses, in anything, he worked as a cashier at a bank, ate lunch at the same place every day, ordered beer and some biscuits. And one night at a function ( concert, he did enjoy music)he met a married woman, ( Mrs. Simco)he enjoyed talking with her, and I feel he thought it was safe from any romantic entanglements (just my opinion), because she was married and so he could frequently go to her place and just talk, her husband saw no harm in this. The talk, both found enjoyable, and one evening she took his hand and pressed it to her cheek. He left the house disturbed by this reaction on her part. He never went back or talked to her again. And years later he found out she had committed suicide. You see he disliked excesses not only in furnishings but in people whether mental or physical. But later on he realizes, that the suicide was caused by his rejection of her. I feel that he finally realized how lonely he really was.<br>   But I think this story by Joyce is no longer copyrighted and you can read it yourself on the internet..<br>  First look at Mr. Duffy's apt, it was bleak, only things that he had to have to live, were there, no pictures hanging on the walls to enjoy, no comforts, I suspect his personality was just as bleak, I mean who can eat the same thing over and over for lunch, he did not even allow himself the variety of choosing something new to eat, just beer and biscuits, over and over, the one thing he allowed himself to enjoy was music, and it was at such a concert that he met Mrs. Simco. Now I suspect he allowed himself her company because she was married, I think he wanted to maintain his life as it was, no romance, to brighten up his life, and when she grabbed his hand he felt his life changing and it distubed him. He was a plain plain person who wanted to live his life on the outside looking in, and his emotions were as plain as the apt he lived in.
1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	A high GPA is necessary, of course.  Good GRE scores are important, but high physics GRE scores can make a big difference.  Research experience is a must for the top programs - you'll be competing against students with publications in top journals, so if you can get a few publications out of your undergrad research, that would help.  Recommendations can make a big difference as well.<br>  <br>  For comparison, I had a 3.7 undergrad GPA, double majors in physics and astronomy, 4 research internships (two at ivy league schools, one a well-respected university, one at a national lab), one publication, three conference presentations, and fantastic recommendations - and I got turned down from all the top grad schools I applied to.  Sometimes you just don't know what your competition will be.  If you know the field you're interested in, find smaller programs (rankings are directly related to the number of grad students they graduate every year, not necessarily the quality of the program) that offer it and have a few top people in the field and use those for back-ups.|`|c5UAa65qaa	A high GPA and a transcript with a lot of challenging courses in physics and related subjects.  High GRE scores.  Research, preferably in the form of papers published or conference presentations.  Extracurriculars, internships, and/or jobs, if they're relevant.  A clear idea of what area you want to focus on, who you want to study with, and why.  And of course, being more impressive in all these areas than the people you're competing against.  There are other factors, but those tend to be the big ones.

m9LxTsc3aa	Auxiliary verb - helping verb. Used w/a verb to make a verb phrase, clarify tense:<br>  <br>  I ran.<br>  I am running - aux v, main verb<br>  I will be running - aux, aux, main<br>  <br>  Linking verb - links the subject to a predicate nominative or predicate adjective - words that restate and refer to the subject:<br>  <br>  I am hungry - I = hungry. Hungry is predicative adj after the linking verb, "am" and explains the subject.<br>  <br>  I am Bob - I = Bob. Bob is predicate nominative after the linking verb that restates the subject. <br>  <br>  So, if the verb is connected to another verb, it's auxiliary. If it connects the subject and a word that refers/explains the subject, it's a linking verb.|`|98XPkvSqaa	To be<br>  To have<br>  <br>  these are auxiliary verbs as in:<br>  <br>  I went fishing<br>  I have fished<br>  <br>  <br>  A linking verb joins (links) two part of a sentence:<br>  <br>  I am a girl.

ZowsabbTaa	ok so just try to concentrate and set goals. <br>  they can be as little as finishing a set of problems for homework in a certain amount of time. Once u actually complete it, it'll make u feel good and hopefully you will want to work faster. Also, just remember, studying and homework is so important. Why? Because its what leads you to where u end up in the future. <br>  <br>  Studying is a little harder, but you can find fun ways to do it. Call up a friend and ask each other questions. Or you can take worksheets and ask a parent to make u a quiz. If you really hate studying, then try to pay attention in class. The more you pay attention, the more you'll learn, and the less you'll need to study, because you already know it! If you need to, take notes in class and when time comes to study for a quiz or test, go over your notes. They may be easier to understand for you opposed to reading from the book.|`|CocszdM1aa	Remember that your whole future depends on it!

VelZmHnYaa	I'm also a second semester high school sophomore!<br>  I'm just going to tell you what my guidance counselor told me.<br>  <br>  - The most important grades (the grades that colleges pay the most attention to) are sophomore year and junior year. So keep up the good grades! Freshman year is not a good indicator for schools to figure out if you're a good candidate for their university, especially since its a transition year from middle school to high school.<br>  <br>  - Lots of extracurriculars can only go so far. Join a sport and find a passion for it. Colleges love to see that a student has a passion (like a hobby or a sport) that they pursue throughout all their years in high school.<br>  <br>  - SAT. My guidance counselor advised me to take an SAT course right before the test so its fresh in my mind. And since its fresh, I'm bound to do better. Take the PSAT at the beginning of the year. Unfortunately, you missed the PSAT for sophomore year, but you can take it at the beginning of Junior year.<br>  <br>  - I don't know much about UGA, but I know Emory is a good school, and Oxford is a VERY GOOD school. I've heard Oxford is a school that you basically self-teach yourself, so if you need structure in a school setting, that's not a very good fit. Also, Oxford takes high SAT scores (like in the 2000s), so try really really hard to get all the practice you can get. You can only practice for the SATs, learn test taking strategies, and don't try to learn hardcore information.<br>  <br>  - You might want to start typing correctly too. I don't know why, but I find it very annoying. You don't want to develop bad typing habits by typing lazily instead of concentrating on your ability to type correctly in a timely manner.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your future years in high school!

Yesterday I asked my brother to help me move and ironically enough he said yes.|`|8jxGnMvmaa	That's a hard one to explain!<br>  <br>  Ironic usually means "contrary to what was expected" often in an amusing, or sarcastic way.<br>  <br>  So if an actor has been struggling in serious theatre for years, then gets an award for a part in a soap opera, you might say:  "It was ironic that he should get an award for that trivial role, when no-one noticed him before".<br>  <br>  People often say that British humour does not work well in the USA because we tend to use irony a lot, whereas the US audience may take things too literally.<br>  <br>  For example, an English comedian might say "I see you got a new coat then!" when it is clear that the person he is speaking to is dressed in rags - irony here is saying one thing when you mean the opposite, for comedic effect.
eJ94Xz8Kaa	It's good to compare what teenage sex was like many years ago and now. <br>  <br>  *Use figures such as pregnancy rates, and explain how it has increased over the years.<br>  *Explain the need for better sex education in school, and why the government have decided to do this.<br>  *Explain how teenagers are influenced by the media around them into having sex.<br>  * Explain the sudden rise in STD's and STI's and how the government are funding new clinics.<br>  <br>  In conclusion compare teenage sex using different dates, and include your own opinion.|`|goe3y4FPaa	lets seee.... h.s dropout rates... have increased.. many.. cause... of teen pregnancy... 80% of teens have had sex.. by there senior year in h.s... 1/3 teens has some type of std.. before age 25... alot of teens have stds.. and dont know about it.. cause they dont test themselves.. most teens have sex.. cause of ''peer pressure''.... alot of teens.. especially girls.. get taken advantage of... when there drunk or druged.. in parts.. and think there still virgins.. 1/5 girls. get pregnant and have ''abortion''.. u could get more ''facts'' on google..|`|BAJd8raoaa	For or against?  Consequences?  Unwanted pregnancies?  Are teens mature enough to deal with it?  Then again, the healthiest babies, worldwide, are born to women between the ages of 14 and 24.  So you have a ten year window in which to have the healthiest baby.  Not to say that there aren't healthy babies born to older women.  That's simply a statistic.  STD's are an issue as well.  But even if it is safe sex, is it good for their emotional well being?  There are tons of articles on it.
zRH530kqaa	You can't you either have to have a PO Box receiving some mail or a relative who lives in that state for longer than 2 years.  So you can't be going to school during that time you said you lived there unless the school is nearby that state. SO YOU CANT GET IN-STATE TUITION|`|aCILl7ctaa	To qualify for in-state tuition you usually have to live in that state for a certain amount of time.<br>  <br>  This amount of time varies depending on which school you are talking about.<br>  <br>  Call the admissions office at the school and ask them to be sure.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

5EGm6ZLhaa	It is all very nice and pretty much any country stated (that is not a war zone) is going to be a good choice, but it depends on what your financial situation is, your desires, how far away from family do you want to be, what do you want do you really want study... this is something you need to think about. Would you prefer to get a degree in an English speaking country or are you fluent enough to succeed at a high academic level in non-English speaking countries?<br>  <br>  You really need to be more specific when asking questions and give a lot more information because I could name all of the countries in the world and they would all be a good fit for you, get a globe and throw a dart at it is what you are asking us to do.

My aunt is a doctor and she loves her job. But if u dont like needles or anything than i wouldnt be a vet or doctor. Because either way the 1st thing they test u on is needles and stuff like that. I would definitely recommend Doctor if i were u!!
YNbgnZD2aa	The expression is "Until death do us part," meaning "Until death separates us." It refers directly to the list of promises you recite just before that final line ("to love and to cherish, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, etc.") This means that the promises you make while reciting your marriage vows last as long as you live.|`|xeMttZGdaa	This means that even the death can not separate apart. <br>  <br>  More like soul after death which wil have the same soulmate as in hindu religion but these particular words are more poetic than being religious but same meaning really.|`|I7mBG3Dnaa	Let us be together even after death.|`|pWHT2f4eaa	i believe its 'til death do us part....or until death do us part<br>  <br>  so ur phrase is wrong...|`|404dbf27fa7877e868281fc2f6fdff39aa	Gee I'm thinking, may we meet up again later.<br>  So if one of you dies at 45, too bad, be single for 45 more years till your'e 90?<br>  Don't know...|`|zlLhETFtaa	I would think it means you'll always be together even after death.|`|VJCyQWRzaa	when we die dont let us part .|`|5212dc743093618cf324d1e25cda787faa	I think it means that even after you die you will still be together.  That is my opinion though.|`|EmV1Kojyaa	This is a twist on the actual marriage vow which reads "until death do us part". Someone was just being smart and changing the words to suit them. However, it won't matter anyway. There is no "marriage" or "committed relationship" to each other after death. Our only committment, dedication and relationship will be to God.|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	When you die...you will part.

7d41e22f79cabbca0ca379a3a7aa40c6aa	I think you've basically got it down. Read textbooks to try to come to a higher level of understanding on the subject. Also That MIT thing looks like another great way to learn. I'm gonna use that myself as I found that I can load those onto my ipod. So from now on I'm listening to one every night. That's assuming that I can commit to that since I have serious problems with commitment. For example one time when I was five my mom gave me a goldfish. I loved little goldy so much but he died. Wanna know why? It was because I couldn't commit to feeding him. Sometimes I still cry about it. <br>  <br>  I'm going to listen to every single lecture on Biology. Then the AP test will be no obstacle. Speaking of the AP I need to register for that sometime soon.|`|7dVtO1gtaa	yes i do. all colleges are, are a overpriced piece of paper. if one seriously wants to pursue intellectual study no college is needed.|`|AA11942204	Are you sure that nothing but cr*p evening courses are available?

zGsUM6P9aa	Tell him the truth and ask if you can take the exam early (its often easier on the teachers that way). Most professors, even with strict policies regarding exams, want their students to succeed.|`|a1b7363978e397f1d4527a8de30ab150aa	Most professors, even those with very strict policies, have a heart and understand how the military works.  If this is someone whom you are very close with and this is the only time you'll have to see him and meet his family, the professor may be willing to let this slide and allow you to take the test early.  Be prepared to do an essay test though; that is what most do when a student takes it early so that they can rest assured that you will not give out the answers.  Always tell the truth because if caught in a lie, it will haunt you forever.|`|bf74fd9aa2c12c988a3e23d98ed4b22faa	They all say no make ups because if they didn't then students would turn in stuff late and not care. I don't think the professor will let you miss the exam for your boyfriend, so you have two options.<br>  <br>  1) lie and tell the professor you have some sort of family emergency<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  2) Arrange to take the exam earlier, which i have done before.|`|Zy4KryYiaa	Tell him the truth. Someone that you love (or may not love) is going to Afghanistan. To me that is important. Also ask if you take the quiz early. Im sure he will undrstand. Best of luck
q9SAuo4waa	The writing grade is a combination on the mark you gained in the writing exam and some pieces of your folio work - personal, imaginative or discursive tasks. <br>  The reading grade is made up of the mark you gain in the close reading exam and the reading in your folio (critical evaluations, imaginative responses) to give you an overall reading grade.<br>  The speaking grade is a combination of your grade for group and individual talk, and again an overall mark is given. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :D

lQIKWXDuaa	You will need to fulfill the pre-med requirements.The pre-med requirements that you need to complete while in college are:<br>  Biology (I &II), Chemistry (I &II), organic chemistry (I &II), physics (I &II), Calculus (I &II), English composition (I&II). Extra classes to make your self competitive are : anatomy & physiology, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Statistic.<br>  <br>  You need a cumulative college GPA of 3.5+ to be competitive.<br>  <br>  You also need to have research experience and clinical experience. Shadow a doctor or something. My advice to you is to become an EMT while you complete your pre-med requirements, this will give you plenty of clinical experience.<br>  <br>  <br>  MCAT: you need to ACE the medical entrance exam known as the MCAT 35+ should be your goal. You take this test in you Junior Year in college. Use Kaplan or another test preparation center. Get the examkracker book it is very helpful.<br>  <br>  Familiarize yourself with this website. They are the one who give the MCAT exam and you will need to apply for medical school through them. <a href="http://www.aamc.org/students/amcas/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aamc.org/students/amcas/</a><br>  <br>  You will need 4 STRONG letters of recommendation speaking to your interest in medicine.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you.

They will probably need to have a background that includes specific biology and chemistry courses.  You may already have taken some of those courses or you may need to go back to school to take the ones that you've missed before applying to med school.  Once you have the necessary courses and have taken the MCAT exams (like the SAT for med students), then you apply for admission.|`|kyCDR2Hgaa	I concur with most of what J812001 has stated.  However, I suggest viewing websites of the schools which you'd like to attend and seeing what their requirements are.  In all honesty, most are not as stringent as a 35+ MCAT.  Your GPA should definitely be high (science and overall GPA are viewed separately).  This said, if you do not meet minimum cut offs (MCAT, GPA) for a school your application will immediately be thrown out and only viewed once again if and only if enough students were not accepted or did not accept their invitation.  <br>  <br>  Clinical experience is a must, and I do not recommend becoming an EMT.  I recommend working with doctors, in hospitals, etc.  Start with shadowing and build up to doctor's/nurse's assistant - even if that's all you can get.  Take any opportunity to take vital signs, draw blood, etc.  The reason I say this is because, unless you'd like to spend a great deal of time becoming an EMT, it is an excellent hands-on approach to get started right away.  What stands out?  Doing something you're passionate about.  Do you want to be an oncologist and spent your summers working with children with cancer, led fundraisers, and perhaps even worked abroad?<br>  <br>  Don't be flat.  In that I mean - stand out from the page! Be a 3-d, real, human being.  Have interests, hobbies, and do more than the bare minimum to get into medical school.  Volunteer because you like it, play rugby because it's your favorite sport and you already lettered in it high school and played intramural sports in college. <br>  <br>  Also, are you interested in MD or DO?  Both end in the same result - you will be a physician.  The main difference are the letters behind your name and the approach with which you will be taught.  DO is a whole person approach whereas MD's treat the illness.  DO's also learn osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) in school, although all do not practice it in the real world.  And of course, both can specialize, etc.  In fact DO's can join MD residencies but not the other way around. <br>  <br>  Although the average age for medical students is 24-25, you will be considered more of a non-traditional student because by the time you enter medical school you will be nearing 30.  Consider this when making your decision.  Certain schools are more welcoming to 'non-traditional' students than others.  <br>  <br>  Another thought is your learning style - do you prefer SBL or PBL? That is, systems based learning or problem based learning. Would you rather sit in a classroom and have a professor give you handouts and information and then you memorize for a test (SBL) or would you prefer to sit in a room with peers and hash out a case study and then give presentations (PBL)?<br>  <br>  Once you've come to your conclusions (and you may want to apply to a few MD, DO, etc) - the application process is relatively simple.  <br>  <br>  Start there: <br>  <a href="http://www.aamc.org/students/applying/start.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aamc.org/students/applying/st...</a><br>  The AMCAS link is on the right, and that's where you begin to fill out MD apps.  They send out your apps to each of your selected schools.  If you received secondaries you follow up with each school. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aacom.org/Pages/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.aacom.org/Pages/default.aspx</a><br>  This is for DO schools.  Several have applications directly from their own website.  <br>  <br>  Be sure to put thought into your answers for essays and make sure your recommendations are strong.  In fact if you can get a recommendation from an alum - that can TRULY make all the difference.  Also, if you make it all the way to an interview - don't become overconfident.  An interview is not a 'formality' and students are really not accepted because of interviews and meet and greets with other students (remember, you're always being interviewed whether or not you realize it).  <br>  <br>  The most important part in choosing a med school is finding your niche.  Good luck!|`|wGh0NnwSaa	Apply to med schools<br>  hope u get accepted

And even if you do well that doesn't mean the college you go to will accept it. Colleges do not accept all AP tests for credit. <br>  <br>  But taking the class will help you to be prepared for college math classes.|`|hfH8c1LWaa	as far as what you learn, is actually very similar, even exactly the same depending on what subject it is. the difference is that its much quicker pace, because a class is only one semester as apposed to 2 in high school, and because u dont go to ur class everyday, u usually go every other day. <br>  <br>  some may say its harder because ur taking the class in half the time of a high school class, but in reality its not that bad. im a freshman in college and still kinda feel like im in high school (with exception to some upper level classes im taking)|`|zuaDpQhQaa	To answer your main question:<br>  It really depends.  In my experience, some college classes (even at great universities) are really not very hard; maybe even easier than high school.  Some are extremely challenging.  It just depends on the university you go to and the professor you have.<br>  <br>  Regarding physics classes:<br>  Some physics classes are based on algebra, some on calculus, but both can be found at most universities.

1bauamEpaa	DEFINITELY don't use 10 and 2.  Everyone now is teaching 9 and 3, because if you go to jerk the wheel (for whatever reason), you have less leverage at 9 and 3 to throw the car clear across the road than at 10 and 2.<br>  <br>  Best tip is to act confident.  Don't make nervous nosies like fake laughing or small talk, just grab the wheel and drive.  Also, make sure you adjust the seat all the way back for the instructor, because if they are big, they might feel uncomfortable right off the bat.|`|eJO4OC2saa	Don't wear anything too cute. Don't chew gum. Don't talk unless you have to. That won't help. Keep your hands on the wheel at ten  and two. Buckle your seat belt first before you even start the car.  Basically the best impression  you can make is to be mature. Act like your instructor is a strict teacher! :)|`|VGTSJhJWaa	Don't worry about the mood of the instructor, concentrate on the road and passing.  Remember what you learned and apply that to the test.  If you are passionate about obtaining your license, have a pleasant demeanor with your instructor and a good attitude, then you should do well.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!  Also, remind the instructor to wear his or her seat belt!
gK5nobhbaa	Well from what I can remember<br>  excellent grades (sounds like you have that one covered)<br>  excellent test scores (ACT SAT)<br>  community involvement is a big one (giving back to your community through volunteering etc.)<br>  School involvement, join clubs, sports teams, student government etc.<br>  Good written ability.  Most colleges ask for an essay along with your application.  You can research some example essays online, they should give you an idea of what to go for.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!
AA10297143	OK, here is the thing:  No college excommunicates you for "cutting up" in middle school.  Those years are almost non existent in the decision process unless you are applying for some ritzy private school, and then "Daddy" will just have to pass a sizable contribution to the school and you get in anyway.  Most colleges only look at your high school transcript for admission purposes and of course your extracurricular activities while in high school.  There is still time to make things right and your boyfriend can easily get into a nice school and learn to be a fine teacher.  He just needs to decide what he wants in life and go for that rather than doing things that draws negative attention to him.|`|AA10948829	1. No one cares what you do in middle school.<br>  2.

It's the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association and it's a nationwide program of horse shows between universities. You don't have to have your own horse to participate as the college sends you for subsidized training and horses are provided at shows. If you are serious about riding at college than you should go to a school which competes in the IHSA. That said, your studies should come first, of course!|`|d4af98bef4634072715e0b3c20d8beefaa	Look in a college catalog. As for law school you need a 4yr degree. The equestrian part is the hard part.

Add all the comical elements such as mistaken identities (twins who mistake each other for themselves, as an example),  two families who really like each other that want their children to marry who can't stand each other, etc.  Whatever the plot, turn it around, bringing in familiar dialog from the most dramatic plays.<br>  <br>  Either that, or a play spoofing where Will really got his ideas...from his mother...(To beat or not to beat, that is the question)...from girls who rejected him....from broken window incidents (light from yonder window breaks)....from neighbors and townsfolk...from the local library....hanging out in the pool hall...from his first job...bad first date (The lady doth protest too much, methinks.)...first lost baseball game (And all the men and women merely players;) etc.|`|5haljsUJaa	If I were you I would just start copying lines from Shakespeare based on their popularity.  Then after you get a bunch of them copied down, try putting them together to make a story.  Sort of like how the play "Momma Mia" took a bunch of Abba songs and turned them into a play.  Here's an example:<br>  <br>  Pissed off parent:  "How sharper than a serpent's tooth..."<br>  Angst ridden teenage daughter:  "To be or not to be...."<br>  Nerdish guy likes this girl "Hark what light thru yonder window breaks"<br>  Girl gives guy the brush off because he's a nerd.<br>  Guy's best friend visits girl:  "I come here to praise the nerd, not to bury him."  (This is actually a paraphrase but it's close enough.)<br>  Guy doesn't lose heart:  "Once more into the breech!"<br>  Girl changes her mind about the guy and thinks about letting him into her breech.  Or not.  Let's keep this "G" rated.<br>  Since this is turning into a love story, you could add some W.S. sonnets to the play.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'm sure you get the idea.

Then tax revenue goes down, schools get less money and they have to start cutting back on services.  Summer school is often one of the things they cut.<br>  <br>  OTOH, it's only February.  I'm sure that with help and hard work, you can bring your grade up by the end of the year.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|uAdOzzDdaa	Well my school said the same thing, that were not having summer school this year. Im sure if you try your best, and get a decent grade like a C though then you will be ok, and pass. Just try your best I know math is hard, im not good at it either.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!! :)|`|CdGHyYDfaa	most schools do have summer school. I think your ss teacher was just scaring you. but mot schools still have summer schools|`|w2WFDunnaa	well calm down first off you need to pay attention in class more often then you're doing math is hard for the most part but if you do your homework make decent grades on test then you should be able to pass. <br>  <br>  I'm sure your teacher would not lie to your class about that. And I think she's right my brothers school isn't having summer school this year or next year do to the economic. Has you might know already kids don't pay for summer school..the government does...so just try and do your best..ask for tutoring or some extra help..oh and you can also ask your teacher for some extra credit papers you can do..try not to talk on the phone when you get home from school do your homework study for a while then you can do all that other good stuff..<br>  <br>  if you put effort into your work and studding then you can pass you just have to try...Good Luck!<br>  <br>  And you won't get held back I promise just study study study...!

4Lzf3wenaa	Ok, first set the second equation equal to b: so,<br>  3a-b=7<br>  b = 3a - 7<br>  Then, substitute this b in for the first equation:<br>  2(3a-7)=6a-14<br>  6a-14=6a-14<br>  Look, they equal, so for any a value it will be true.  So your answer is all solutions.<br>  Actually, you could have figured this out right away by simplifying the first equation by 2: so<br>  2b=6a-14 is b=3a-7 or rewrite as 3a-b=7 (the same as the second equation)

rTaaIXSuaa	This has brought back a time when I had a hard time from a 'christian' homeschooling program getting my son's transcripts.<br>  Jubilee Academy would not give me my son's transcripts unless I PAID them $50 dollars! I transfered my children at the time to a public school and it took the counselor's threat to sue them that prompted immediate action from Jubilee. By law, when a school requests transcripts they are to turn them over and they CANNOT be charged a fee for them. Ridiculous isn't it?<br>  It makes me wonder about these so called christian academies. Don't get me wrong, not all of them are money hungry like a few that I have run into, but it would seem that this school that your son was associated with, is attempting to get as much as they can from you. Have you looked over the fine print on the paperwork/contract? That could be a possible reason as to why they are doing this. They might have a contract which states what they are doing is within their right even if you unenroll them. Read it over.<br>  Have you talked with the super from there? Or perhaps gone higher than the idiots that are wanting money from you? I would. If nothing works from there, I would file a complaint with the FTC. I know that would sound like the last place to go, but when I did, I got an apology letter from the school regarding the complaint! Go figure. lol Contact the state's attorney general as well.<br>  Best of luck to you, and I'm sorry you are going through this. But you will get out of it!|`|6fVzzNhiaa	Probably the first thing to do is read the enrollment agreement you had with the school.  You need to know the ins and outs of the contract if you've already paid in full but yet are being dunned.  I've never heard of financial penalties for children not meeting "deadlines."<br>  <br>  Once you figure out where you (might) stand, and if you fail to reach an agreement with the school, you could get in touch with your state's attorney general.  You could also talk to the Better Busines Bureau.<br>  <br>  This page might explain their attitude about ability to complete assignments, although no mention is made of late fees on lessons.

I don't think I'm gonna do as well as I did last year, 5s, because of a few of my teachers (who I doubt have any real credentials to even be teaching). Unfortunately, I can't control the government. There is some good news: they've done away with the NRT (which I actually prefer to the FCAT since it comapres you to students across the country, but I already took a test, NAEP, that supposedly makes our 'Nation's Report Card' - look it up). Hopefully, I'll pass with at least 3s (and I'm not being pessimistic, I'm being realistic). I hope so dearly that there is no Intensive Science.

NPtz1Y4Taa	Facts About Evacuation During a Radiation Emergency<br>  In the event of a radiation emergency, such as a nuclear power plant accident or the explosion of a radioactive “dirty bomb” (www.bt.cdc.gov/radiation/dirtybombs.asp... you may need to leave your home or the immediate area (evacuate). Depending on the direction the radioactive cloud or stream (called the plume) is moving from the incident site (the area where the accident or explosion took place), you may have to evacuate or go to an emergency shelter. This fact sheet will help you decide on the best actions to protect yourself and your family.<br>  What you should do during a radiation emergency<br>  If an incident occurs that involves radiation, whether accidental or intentional, you should listen for radio or television reports that will tell you if your area should be evacuated. It is important to wait until you are told to evacuate so that you will know which direction the radioactive plume is moving and how to avoid it.<br>  What you should do if you are told to take shelter where you are<br>  You may need to take shelter where you are until an evacuation order is given. Stay inside. Close and lock all windows and doors, and close fireplace dampers. Turn off fans, air conditioners, and forced-air heating units that bring air in from the outside. Go to a room in the middle of your home or workplace, or go to the basement, if possible. Your shelter should have as few windows as possible. For more information on sheltering, see the fact sheet, “Sheltering in Place During a Radiation Emergency” (www.bt.cdc.gov/radiation/shelter.asp) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br>  How to know whether to evacuate<br>  Local police officers, emergency coordinators, or government officials will alert you with radio and television messages if you need to evacuate. Each situation can be different, and local authorities will need to find out which direction the radioactive plume is moving before ordering people to evacuate. Local authorities will tell you when to go to an emergency shelter, where the shelter is located, and in which direction you should travel to avoid the radioactive plume.<br>  Why you may be told not to evacuate<br>  Some people may be safer staying in place than they would be evacuating. For example, your child in school may be miles away from the incident, and the wind may carry the radioactive plume away from the school. It may be safer for your child to remain at school than to come home to an area where there is a danger of exposure to the radioactive plume.<br>  What to do if you’re told to evacuate<br>  Act quickly and follow the instructions of local officials and emergency coordinators. Each situation can be different, so local officials will give you special instructions to follow that are particular to the situation. If you have time, turn off the air conditioner, heater, or ventilation system to your house. Close and lock all windows and doors if you have time.<br>  In your car, keep the windows closed and the ventilation system turned off. If you do not have your own transportation, make plans in advance of an emergency with people who can give you a ride. Check with local officials to see what plans are in place to evacuate people who cannot or do not drive.<br>  orWhat is evacuation?<br>  <br>  Evacuation means leaving a place. During the Second World War, many children living in big cities and towns were moved temporarily from their homes to places considered safer, usually out in the countryside.<br>  <br>  When did evacuations take place in Britain?<br>  <br>  The British evacuation began on Friday 1 September 1939. It was called 'Operation Pied Piper'.<br>  <br>  Between 1939 - 1945 there were three major evacuations in preparation of the of the German Luftwaffe bombing Britain.<br>  <br>  The first official evacuations began on September 1 1939, two days before the declaration of war. By January 1940 almost 60% had returned to their homes. <br>  <br>  <br>  A second evacuation effort was started after the Germans had taken over most of France. From June 13 to June 18, 1940, around 100,000 children were evacuated (in many cases re-evacuated).<br>  <br>  When the Blitz began on 7 September 1940, children who had returned home or had not been evacuated were evacuated. <br>  <br>  By the end of 1941, city centres, especially London, became safer.<br>  <br>  <br>  From June 1944, the Germans attacked again by firing V1 rockets on Britain, followed later by also V2 rockets. 1,000,000 women, children, elderly and disabled people were evacuate from London.<br>  This new way of attacking Britain carried on until the end of the war in Europe in May 1945. <br>  <br>  <br>  OR<br>  ------------------<br>  Progress of evacuation<br>   <br>  British troops escaping from Dunkirk in lifeboats.Initial plans called for the recovery of 45,000 men from the British Expeditionary Force within two days, at which time it was expected that German troops would be able to block further evacuation. Only 25,001 men escaped during this period, including 7,001 on the first day.[6] Ten additional des

At the beginning of the presentation you can give the answers to get the audience engaged, or simply mention the quiz and that the answers will be provided at the end. Ask students what kind of impact tourism might have on the environment, or give them examples of an eco-tourist project and ask them to make the connection, before you even start. That will get their minds going and more invested in finding out the answers. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|QPwkoZSkaa	try to find some amazings facts on this topics and start with it as an introduction in order to arouse the audience interrest.<br>  during the presentation, try to be as interactive as possible<br>  use powerpoint slide to support your presentation : put a lot of photograhs (very few text) in order to support your speech<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  enargeia<br>  <a href="http://www.thepptlibrary.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.thepptlibrary.com</a>

EzVbINaUaa	Well the capital was moved after the American Revolution as part of a compromise (known as the DC Compromise) that was made when the Constitution was being drafted. The northern states had a much larger debt than the southern states after the war, so in order to get the South to agree to the assumption of all debts, the government said that it would move the capital to Washington DC. It was a much more central location, and more easily accessible to all of the states. (Before, the South didn't want to assume the debts because they felt it was unfair that the North didn't have to pay off all of their debt.)<br>  <br>  So basically DC is a better location due to its proximity to all of states during that time period.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!

This is not always what a semicolon does but it worked like that in this instance. "Accustomed" basically means "used to," so the first part of the sentence (before the semicolon) means that once "he" became used to the native showing deference (respect, more or less) to the soldiers, "he" became very overbearing and domineering. How these people were behaving somehow made our man "he" feel more power, and why this is so, I do not know. I assume there is more to the story.|`|JyDIrXzeaa	He came to be a little too much, a little to intimidating (powerful or scary almost) after he had gotten used to how easy to command the natives were to the soldiers.

P3e2kJtwaa	The vo-tech classes through high school are wonderful.. I say go for it!<br>  I took Licensed Practical Nursing my senior year of high school, and finished it the following year.  I am now a nurse at the age of 19, and have been for close to 8 months.<br>  I'm working on classes to become an RN, am working in a hospital (mother-baby floor), and absolutely love what I do.  I only had to pay a total of $6,000 including tuition, books, uniforms, etc (which is far cheaper than the $25,000) course offered at other places (which you can't even start until after you graduate high school).<br>  I don't regret my decision at all, and I applaud you for thinking about beginning your healthcare career so early (and trust me, we need more nursing assistants).<br>  Good luck with everything!

Senegal was France's oldest colony in black Africa, and the two countries have maintained the close ties developed during the colonial period since political independence in 1960. The article argues that decolonization in fact reinforced the ties between Senegal and France, rather than the opposite, and that this "special relationship" is only now changing. Senegal has recently begun to diversify its foreign relations, both within Africa and elsewhere. President Abdoulaye Wade, who won the 2000 presidential election and whose party now controls the government, has sought closer relations notably with Washington but also with London. As one of the leading promoters of the New Partnership for African Development, Wade has also sought to build stronger links within Africa, particularly with South Africa and Nigeria.

BOUlr1OMaa	It depends on your bus driver. I used to leave stuff on the bus sometimes. My bus driver always walked down the isle to check for garbage or other crap and when she found forgotten things she'd place them at the front by the window. I'd be able to get it back. Your bus driver probably has to check the bus before she drops it off at the end of the day to make sure everything is safe and good so its likely that they will find your things and save them. Make sure to ask her first thing tomorrow morning :)|`|AA10770008	Yes. Your bus driver has to return the item ,or give it to the school. If you wait two weeks then you can't get it back. You might want to do it As Soon As Possible. If he refuses to give it back then report him to school officials.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	yes, phone them and let them know you left your shoes on the bus by accident. call asap.|`|ntfOcTnWaa	Call your school, or school transportation, or tomorrow ask your bus driver.

yGOmMQP7aa	Living arrangements are not a factor in determining dependency status.  You must be able to answer "Yes" to one of these questions.<br>  It does not matter where you live, who claims or doesn't claim you on your taxes or who does or does not support you.<br>  <br>  Generally, to be considered independent and not list the folks income, you have to be 24 or older, or married, or have kids you support, or have a bachelors degree already or be a veteran.  There are a few more less common, and I will link all 13 questions here.|`|EatOMhGjaa	If your parents do not claim you and I believe if you are at a certain age then you are considered independent. On the FAFSA application you need to put independent and they shouldn't ask for your parents income. If they do just ignore it.

AA10393340	Take six marbles and put three on each side of the scale. If the heavier marble is there that side will go down. If so take those three marbles and put one on one side and one on the other. If one goes down it is heaviest, if not it is  the odd one. If both sides balance on the first weigh, take the two remaining marbles and weigh them against each other.<br>  <br>  Easy|`|AA11952527	Let's label the marbles A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H. In the first weigh-in, we measure A, B and C against D, E and F. If they are equal, we know the lighter marble is either G or H, and we can use the second weighing to determine which one it is. If, on the other hand, A, B and C together are heavier or lighter than D, E and F, we have narrowed down which group of three contains the defective marble. Then in the second weigh-in, we measure two of those three marbles against each other. If one is lighter than the other, we know it's defective. If the two marbles are equal in weight, then the third marble in the group is defective.

jgPJtlEaaa	Involuntary servitude is a service the person didn't choose as a career but had it put on them. Could have been a parent selling a child for a limited period of service or a court ordered service to pay off  a debt. No matter how it happened there is a time limit on the length of service. Slavery is buying the person not the service.

K5Qntlnaaa	You should see your school counselor, they can help you pick out classes you should take in preparation for college. I want to be a pediatrician too! =) You should take math all throughout high school, and you'll need science too. Take advantage of AP courses, as well, because they help a lot when you start college and its nice to have the credits.|`|AA11404742	First thing you should do is to go talk to your academic or career adviser.  Most high schools have one, and he/she will know best what you need to do, and what your school offers to get you there.<br>  <br>  My guess is that you'll be told to start on the heavy-duty science classes.  Chemistry, physics, math come to mind first.  After that, advanced english, maybe latin if it's still offered anywhere, psychology if they offer it.  Take every class as an Advanced Placement or Honors class if it's available.  Not only can they help you get ahead when you start college, but the academic discipline you'll have to develop will help you in college, when it comes time to start taking hard courses.<br>  <br>  Understand also that pre-med programs want only top students, so even if the class isn't one that is considered a science class, you'll still need to do well in it.|`|1UPwDfJgaa	You could shadow at a local hospital for the rest of your time in high school.  It looks really good on your resume.  Plus you get to learn the ropes of being a physician.<br>  <br>  You need to pick out and apply for an undergraduate college.  I would pick a somewhat popular one that has a good science or premed program.  Do good on your SAT's.<br>  <br>  You will need to take the MCAT's, it's never to early to start studying.  I highly recommend Kaplan's MCAT study guide.  It will even help you in undergrad school.|`|xHK7PGoAaa	Education<br>  General - As a Pediatrician, you will ALWAYS be learning!<br>  After high school, you need 4 years of undergraduate courses at a college or university (which will get you a BS, BA, or other Bachelor's degree). After completing college, you will need to attend 4 years of Medical School (which will get you an MD or DO degree). After this, you are a "general" doctor. Most of the time, these new doctors go on to learn a specialty in medicine, such as pediatrics. This entails at least 3 more years of "Residency" training (the first year of residency was formerly called an "Internship"). In the case of pediatrics, the training of residency is 3 years. After completing these 3 years, you are now a pediatrician and are "eligible" to become "certified" in pediatrics by passing a rigorous test that deals with medical conditions related to infants and children. This is the ultimate goal of a pediatrician's training. <br>  <br>  Bottom line: 4 years college + 4 years medical school + 3 years of residency = 11 years (after high school).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  High School - this is where it really begins. <br>  Classes: Basic Sciences (biology, chemistry, physics, algebra, geometry, calculus if possible).<br>  Humanities (English, a foreign language - we'd recommend Spanish)<br>  Get involved in high school charity organizations, like the Key Club, and extracurricular programs like student government, music programs, and sports.<br>  Plan to get into the best 4-year college your grades allow. The better (and thus the harder) the more likely you are to get into medical school. It generally doesn't matter whether it is a big school or small school - just a good school.<br>  <br>  Bottom Line: Develop good study habits and be involved!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  College - makes you or breaks you!<br>  Most students take a "Premed" curriculum - which includes some basic science courses. Most colleges have a "Premed" advisor - a professor who you are linked with who helps guide those students interested in going on to medical school in their course choices, major choices, etc. Although some universities have a "Premed" major, most allow you to major in ANY area of your interest. Music majors, Philosophy majors, and English majors often make the best medical school candidates (meaning you don't need a "Premed" major, Chemistry major or Biology major). You simply need to fulfill the basic science course requirements that most medical schools recommend. These include:<br>  Biology - 1-2 courses of basic, 1 course of genetics, 1 course of microbiology, 1 course of molecular biology.<br>  Chemistry - 1-2 courses in basic, 1-2 courses of Organic Chemistry.<br>  Physics - 1 course in basic.<br>  Math - 2 courses in calculus.<br>  <br>  Medical schools LOVE to see volunteer activities during college - such as Circle K, volunteering at your local hospital or homeless shelter, etc. It is important to show you have an interest in the medical field by working in some manner around medical people - whether it is getting a summer job in a pharmacy or in a nursing home as a nurse's aide.<br>  <br>  Sometime in your Junior or early Senior year in college you will need to prepare and take the MCAT (Medical College Admission Test), which tests your abilities in the natural sciences. It is much like the SAT is for college entrance…but much harder! Good scores on this test don't guarantee entrance into medical school, but it certainly helps you out.<br>  <br>  Bottom Line: Be sure you are up for the challenge of medical school by taking on the challenge to do well in college - and you must do well!<br>  <br>  Medical School (or Medical College) - you've made it!<br>  Once you are in medical school, almost 99% of the time, you will complete the program and become a doctor. The first two years are focused on basic medical sciences, like human anatomy, physiology, chemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, neuroanatomy, etc. The second two years focus on clinical sciences, where you start to really get "hands-on" experience with patients. These courses include Internal Medicine, Radiology, Cardiology, Surgery, Emergency Medicine, OB/GYN, etc. (and Pediatrics!).<br>  <br>  Sometime during your 3rd or 4th year of medical school, you will decide on a specialty area of medicine. Specialties are divided into "Primary Care" specialties, like Family Practice, Internal Medicine, and Pediatrics; and "Subspecialty Care", like surgery, orthopedics, cardiology, neurosurgery, gastroenterology, etc.). Your exposure to these fields during your 3rd and 4th years will give you direction and confirmation as to whether Pediatrics is indeed your best choice. <br>  <br>  Bottom Line: You learn more than you ever thought you could learn!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Residency<br>  Once done with Medical School, you are now officially a doctor. Your skills will now be refined, and if you choose Pediatrics, you will enjoy the wonderful and challenging world of dealing with and treating children. <br>  <br>  This will be the most difficult 3 years of your training, and likely, of your life! You start becoming more and more responsible for t|`|Cfja6h4Kaa	Check with your local college (or a college you might want to attend) to find out what their requirements are for accepting a student to their pre-med program. You will need to get your regular MD, then specialize in pediatrics.
mbXHkf1maa	This may not be a welcome comment, but you could write a great deal on how it isn't an Emerson quote.  Emerson unfortunately is one of the most frequent "quote magnets" who attract false attributions of sayings.<br>  <br>  This is a very ancient saying. The oldest version I know of comes from the Norse "Poetic Edda" dating back to the 13th century AD. That might make interesting background.<br>  <br>  If you know a friend you can fully trust,<br>  Go often to his house:<br>  Grass and brambles grow quickly<br>  Upon the untrodden track.<br>  - Havamal ("Words of the High One")<br>  Trans.

In other words, if you leave things for too longs, time, distance, and other things - the weeds - will be in the way of reconnecting with that friend.

Whatever you do on one side of the equation, you have to do to the other.

(This rule will be slightly modified in grade 9 when you have division and multiplication)<br>  <br>  2) Move all the numbers with x attached to them to one side of the equation and all the "regular" numbers to the other side using the above rule.

C5E2liU8aa	First of all, government is never the solution. Government is the problem. <br>  <br>  Foremost there is no competition for government backed school money. This breeds laziness and a poor product. The school system is a prime example of a command economy, which I usually consider a problem.<br>  <br>  If the pile of money for education followed the student to a school of the choice. there would be better schools. The bad schools would close. It is that simple. A free market solution would solve so many problems. <br>  <br>  The objection is always: what about the bad students? <br>  <br>  Bad has two definitions:<br>  First, those who are handicapped in some way. These students can and would receive special services and more money follows them. Schools would specialize. I know this goes against the current trends in education of inclusion. <br>  <br>  Second, behavior problems. Send them to me. I have some of the most difficult student you could imagine. I teach in a place most teachers do not last. We had one teacher that lasted 48 hours before he quit. There are lots of places that will gladly take these students and there will be lots of places that spring up to take these students. <br>  <br>  The other objection: what about religious schools? Allow them. Do not discriminate on the basis of religions. If a mosque wants to open a Islamic school - go for it! Schools would have to show maintaining a certain level or profiancy for students and require ACT or SAT or GED for graduation. Does this mean Christian schools will have to make sure students can understand evolution? Yes. Notice I did not say agree with evolution. <br>  <br>  For the record I work for a for profit long term treatment facility for minors. We receive public money and somehow or another no one complains about us taking these students. <br>  <br>  Everyone deserves freedom of choice for education.|`|9Sx4PzBmaa	As an (unemployed) teacher I see a lot of disorganization in many our public schools systems, in every thing from how staff is hired to the administering of programs, precious time and energy is wasted all too often.  I recently applied to sub in a small district that has really been in need of substitutes.  They reviewed my file, shipped it out to another company who processed it and sent it BACK to the district to be completed, where it sat for a week and a half because someone was on vacation.  Now its a month later and I still am not in their computer system as a substitute.<br>  <br>  Funding is of course a problem.  Many people outside the educational system don't see how bad it is in some places.  They think teachers get great pay for a job that gives them the whole summer off, and that's just not the case.   Many teachers take on second jobs just to make ends meet, or to buy supplies for their classroom.  Its a shame when someone spends a long day instructing our furture leaders, then has to go stand on their feet for another 6 hours at a retail job (instead of resting up and planning instruction for the next day)  just so that the kids in the classroom can have books to read or supplies to use.  And its a shame that a single, young teacher in some areas cannot makes ends meet on a salary from a professional job which they attended college for 5 years to get. <br>  <br>  Less money in the schools means less teachers which equals larger class sizes and less attention to each student.<br>  <br>  Parents also need to become RESPONSIBLY involved with their child's education.  I say responibly, because they need to be doing what is right for their child.  50 years ago, if a child came home with detention, they were punished or at least scolded by the parents.  Nowadays a teacher might not see a student's parents for a whole semester, but that parent is quick to show up screaming at the teacher for the detention that their "baby" doesn't deserve. As a society, we need to learn how to be a bit more humble and guide our children to do right, even when we have to enforce consequences.<br>  <br>  Of course, as one of the country's many unemployed teachers, I think that issue needs to be dealt with as well.  Some states (such as here in Michigan) continue to recruit and roll out thousands of new teachers every year when there are only a few hundred jobs available.  Some of them move to states with teacher shortages, but those who are not able to relocate are stuck being unemployed, with very specialized job skills that won't get them very far in the workforce, as struggle to pay their student loans off.  Of course, no one told them the situation when they entered the teaching program...the colleges continue to recruit and certifty more and more without regard to job situations.
AA11184257	Make sure things are at child's level. Sounds funny, but get down on your knees and view things from their perspective. If they can interact with the display all the better. Make sure that the things on it have relevance to them(best if their work) and that you discuss it with them once displayed. If a wall display its good to try to give things a 3D effect, you can stuff paper behind things to fill them out or attach pictures to something like a small box(i've used empty washed small milk cartons, the ones the kids get) and then pin these to the wall to again give more of a three dimensional effect.

Of the many different types of health care available to a person, pre-natal care for a pregnant woman is one of the most important types of care one may receive in their life and their child’s life. When I was pregnant I received prenatal care on a regular basis. Tonight I will be talking about why prenatal care is important, the side effects of not receiving health care and health care options that are available to pregnant women. <br>  <br>  A. According to the Mayo Clinic (www.mayoclinic.com) a pregnant woman should receive prenatal care immediately upon finding out she is pregnant. This is both the safest and easiest way to ensure the health of the mother and her unborn baby.<br>  1. Receiving prenatal care test can be run to make sure the baby is healthy.

NPtz1Y4Taa	mainly the main causes of rebellions are "religion first and formost" this always causes wars !2nd money 3rd greed and anvy "jealousy I PUT MORE IN BUT IT AS NOT SHOWN UP <br>  The Pilgrimage of Grace, The Lincolnshire rising, was a popular rising by Roman Catholics in Northern England in 1536, in protest against England's break with Rome & the Dissolution of the Monasteries, as well as other specific political, social & economic grievances. Although the Pilgrimage was a specific uprising around York, the term has come to describe a series of rebellions that occurred in the North in late 1536 & early 1537.<br>  The Lincolnshire Rising was a brief rebellion of Roman Catholics against the establishment of the Church of England by Henry VIII & the dissolution of the monasteries. It began at St. James Church, Louth, after evensong on October 1, 1536, shortly after the closure of Louth Abbey, & quickly gained support in Horncastle, Caistor & other nearby towns. The people of Louth had recently purchased a new church spire. Angry with the actions of commissioners, the rebels demanded the end of the collection of a subsidy, the end of the Ten Articles, an end to the dissolution, an end to taxes in peacetime, a purge of heretics in government, & the repeal of the Statute of Uses. With support from local gentry, a rebel force, whose size has been estimated at up to 40,000, marched on Lincoln & by October 6 had occupied Lincoln Cathedral, demanding the freedom to continue as practising Catholics & protection for the treasures of Lincolnshire churches. The rebellion was effectively ended on October 10, 1536, when King Henry sent word for the occupiers to disperse or face the forces of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, which had already been mobilised. By October 14, few remained in Lincoln. Following the rising, Thomas Kendall, the vicar of Louth & its spiritual leader, was captured & executed, as were most of the other local ringleaders over the next twelve months. However, the Lincolnshire Rising would inspire shortly the more widespread Pilgrimage of Grace.<br>  Political Grievances — Many northerners had disliked the way in which Henry VIII had 'cast off' Catherine of Aragon. There was also anger at the rise of Thomas Cromwell. <br>  Religious Grievances — The local church was, for many in the north, the centre of community life. Many ordinary peasants were worried that their church plate would be confiscated. There were also popular rumours at the time which hinted that baptism might be taxed. The recently released Ten Articles & the new order of prayer issued by the government in 1535 had also made official doctrine more reformed. This went against the conservative beliefs of most northerners. <br>  Robert Aske, a London barrister from a Richmondshire (Aske Hall) family, & a band of nine thousand followers entered & occupied York. There he arranged for the expelled monks & nuns to return to their houses; the king's tenants were driven out & Catholic observance resumed. The success of the rising was so great that the royal leaders, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk & George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury, opened negotiations with the insurgents at Doncaster, where Aske had assembled between thirty & forty thousand men<br>  -----------<br>  PRAYER BOOK<br>  -----The Prayer Book Rebellion or Western Rebellion was a popular rising occurred in the southwest of England in 1549.<br>  <br>  In the 1540s the government of Edward VI introduced a range of legislative measures as an extension of the Protestant Reformation in England & Wales, the primary aim being to remove certain practices from the church which were perceived as being too Catholic. In 1549 the Book of Common Prayer in English replaced the four old liturgical books in Latin. The change was widely unpopular amongst religious conservatives — particularly in areas of traditionally Catholic religious loyalty, for example, in Devon & Cornwall<br>  -----------<br>  KETTS--<br>  Kett's Rebellion was a revolt in July 1549 instigated by Robert Kett of Wymondham. Kett himself had been a tanner who had used enclosure on the common landKett. When rebels came to rip down his fences he was convinced by their arguments & soon became the leader of the rebellion. It was aimed at bringing attention to the economic problems faced by agricultural workers in East Anglia. In the spirit of the Levellers of the next century, the leaders demanded the abolition of enclosures, the end of private ownership of land, & the dismissal of counsellors. To a lesser degree, the rebellion also had religious leanings, with the rebellion campaigning for further Protestant reforms & the right to choose their own priests. The rebels themselves did not believe that they were rebels as they didn't think that they had done any real harm & they thought that they had the support of the Duke of Somerset. He had made it seem to them that he was going to aid them in the enclosure crisis & establish enclosure commissions. But this was never to be;somerset was not going to risk upsetting nobles who|`|7HKTDcvYaa	Most rebellions are started by people who want to aggrandize their own importance and social standing. They always have a cause, or several, and these are significant to those they lead.<br>  <br>  But the cause is not what historians record. The cause recorded is what the leaders say the cause is. But invariably the leaders will have self serving objectives. The cause proclaimed is a way to get a following.<br>  <br>  However, every rebellion has been 'caused' by established authority  having no way to vet opinions of others through to a good resolution, where a good resolution will be accepted by any reasonable person, and yes, reaching such a good resolution may take forever. But then if the only option is open rebellion, it may be better to acknowledge that the issue is not worth being divided about.

After leaving government service, he founded Kissinger Associates, an international consulting firm, of which he is chairman.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ayatollah Khomeini in his 10 years of leadership established a theocratic rule over Iran. He did not fulfil his pre-revolution promises to the people of Iran but instead he started to marginalize and crash the opposition groups and those who opposed the clerical rules. He ordered establishment of many institutions to consolidate power and safeguard the cleric leadership. During his early years in power he launched the Cultural Revolution in order to Islamize the whole country. Many people were laid off, and lots of books were revised or burnt according to the new Islamic values. Newly established Islamic Judiciary system sentenced many Iranians to death and long-term imprisonment as they were in opposition to those radical changes. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A leading member of the revolutionary Ba'ath Party, which espoused secular pan-Arabism, economic modernization, and Arab socialism, Saddam played a key role in the 1968 coup that brought the party to long-term power. As vice president under the ailing General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, Saddam tightly controlled conflict between the government and the armed forces—at a time when many other groups were considered capable of overthrowing the government—by creating repressive security forces. In the early 1970s, Saddam spearheaded Iraq's nationalization of the Western-owned Iraq Petroleum Company, which had long held a monopoly on the country's oil. Through the 1970s, Saddam cemented his authority over the apparatuses of government as Iraq's economy grew at a rapid pace.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Osama bin Laden (born March 10, 1957) is a member of the prominent Saudi bin Laden family and the founder of the terrorist organization al-Qaeda, best known for the September 11 attacks on the United States.

That's because after the great depression occurred, we worked to fix these problems and we are way more prepared this time around then last time.

7PvjQrMoaa	let x equal the amount of adult tickets sold, so your equation would look like:<br>  <br>  180=x(5) + (50-x)(3)<br>  <br>  180 is the ticket sales, x we already mentioned and 50-x because she only sold 50 tickets so the amount of student tickets sold would be 50 minus whatever the amount of adult tickets sold is. So then you just go through and solve for x:<br>  <br>  180=x(5) + (50-x)(3)<br>  180=5x + 150 - 3x<br>  180=2x + 150<br>  30=2x<br>  15=x<br>  <br>  But you're still not done! x is the amount of adult tickets sold, and 50-x is the amount of student tickets sold, and so your final answer would be:<br>  <br>  There were 15 adult tickets sold and 35 student tickets sold.<br>  <br>  Hope that answers your question :)|`|DsNEpN95aa	So you want to create two equations for the information given.<br>  <br>  5x + 3y = 180<br>  explanation: For an x amount of tickets sold for the adults and y amount of tickets sold for adults, the costs in total is  $180.<br>  <br>  x + y =50. The amount of x and y tickets sold is 50 tickets.<br>  <br>  So you got these two equations:<br>  5x + 3y = 180<br>  x + y =50<br>  <br>  Now you can solve that using substitution or elimination. In this case, I would prefer elimination.<br>  If you want to eliminate the y first, multiply the 2nd equation by -3. Or you can eliminate the x first, by multiplying 2nd equation by -5. I'll just eliminate y. So I get this for the second equation: -3x-3y=-150. <br>  <br>  Now I have these 2 equations:<br>  5x + 3y = 180<br>  -3x-3y=-150<br>  <br>  I can add both together, the y cancels out. I get 2x =30, so x = 15. <br>  I plug the x into one of the easier original equation, 15 + y = 50, so y=35.<br>  <br>  Just to check my answers, I plug both x and y into the first original  equation, 5(15) + 3(35)=180. YAY, it works so it's right.<br>  <br>  x=15 and y=35.|`|2LKABDPzaa	Let x = number of adult tickets sold<br>  Then, 50 - x = number of student tickets sold<br>  <br>  5x + 3(50 - x) = 180<br>  5x + 150 - 3x = 180<br>  2x + 150 = 180<br>  2x = 180 - 150<br>  2x = 30<br>  x = 30/2<br>  x = 15<br>  <br>  She sold 15 adult tickets and 35 student tickets.|`|IVf39hSJaa	29 adult tickets and 21 student tickets|`|AJviOb6saa	Here,<br>  <br>  x = # of student tickets sold<br>  y = # of adult tickets sold<br>  <br>  3x + 5y = 180<br>  x + y = 50<br>  <br>  We have two equations, so we can solve for x and y.<br>  You can add/subtract equations or substitute.<br>  I'll just use the former option.<br>  <br>    (3x + 5y = 180)<br>  - (3x + 3y = 150)<br>  -------------------------<br>    2y = 30<br>  <br>  So y = 15.<br>  <br>  Remember the equation x + y = 50?<br>  Since we know y = 15 now, we can substitute this value in for y.<br>  <br>  x + 15 = 50<br>  x = 35<br>  <br>  So 15 adult tickets and 35 student tickets were sold.<br>  Confirm: 5(15) + 3(35) = 180 = 75+105|`|AA11735935	5x + 3(50-x) = 180<br>  5x + 150 - 3x = 180<br>  5x-3x + 150 - 150 = 180 -150<br>  2x = 30<br>  x = 15<br>  50-x=35<br>  <br>  15 adult tickets<br>  35 student stickers

Basically, you should check with your lender. If you take out another loan with the same lender, they will often allow you to have one monthly billing for all your loans. You may be able to consolidate your loans, as well, but you should always make sure that consolidation will make the most economic sense to you. If you consolidate, you will often lose certain borrower benefits (like a certain rate percentage reduction for making automatic payments) and may end up with a higher interest rate on one of the loans. Just check with your lender before you do anything. Also, if you're going to a different school, make sure the lender you work with lends to students at the new school.

CCMcpYAVaa	Not everybody who applies gets an interview.  They try to interview a lot of students but some never get interviews.  It is not necessarily a sign of interest though.  Many students get accepted who did not have interviews.  Still, think of the interview as a time to really shine.  Your personality can really come out in an interview and if you really connect with your interviewer it can give you a substantial bump.  Try not to be too worried about it.  <br>  <br>  All Ivy-League and top colleges mail out letters on March 31 or April 1.  You will get it by April 3-4 and possibly sooner depending on where you live.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for more information on the college admissions process, check out <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/College-Admissions-Advice" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/College-Admission...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck
