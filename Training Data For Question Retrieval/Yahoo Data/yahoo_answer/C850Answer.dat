0df04b708f3078cdb74b6f448834a6aeaa	Bueno, yo trabajo en un banco en la parte de emision de tarjetas de credito, asi que te puedo explicar.    La tarjeta que tienes es tipo planillera, esto significa que funciona como tarjeta de debito, pero es exclusivamente para pagos de planillas a los empleados.    Por eso es que al ingresar tu numero de tarjeta, el sistema del banco genera un error, y es por que la tarjeta no aplica ni como debito ni de credito. Tu puedes realizar transferencias con ella, pero el monto de la tarjeta sera el mismo que el banco emisor deposite en tu cuenta, por esto es que no es de debito, ya que en las tarjetas de debito el monto de la tarjeta es el que TU misma depositas como ahorro en tu cuenta.    En cuanto a tu duda de la diferencia, la tarjeta de debito ya te explique como funciona; la de credito en cambio, el tarjetahabiente posee un monto en su tarjeta que es financiado por el banco. El banco, digamos asi, le presta el dinero y este tiene una fecha limite para cancelar sus transacciones.    En cuanto a lo de la tarjeta planillera, las empresas generalmente cancelan este tipo de tarjetas tiempo despues de que el empleado ha dejado la empresa, asi que no creo que la puedas seguir utilizando.    Saludos!|`|a2a3deaea4cb092073af2d2e24c1c175aa	Lady Blue.  Ya te explicaron la diferencia.  Tu tarjeta de debito lo abri la empresa en la que trabajaste, para pagarte el salario.  Una vez que ya no perteneces a la empresa, sta te la puede cerrar.  Si todava tenas plata en tu cuenta, la tenes que sacar por la caja comn, imagino. Si no te la cierran, la podes seguir usando, pero la plata la tenes que depositar tu en el banco antes de usarla (en tu caja de ahorro), porque si no tenes plata en tu cuenta, no tenes nada que te descuenten.

We would request two months rent paid in advance plus the standard security deposit.  We would not accept personal checks, money orders or cashiers checks only.

Requesting transcripts (individuals):    You have two easy and convenient options for getting copies of your federal tax return information--tax return transcripts and tax account transcripts--by phone or by mail.

It does not reflect any changes you, your representative or the IRS made after the return was filed.  In many cases, a return transcript will meet the requirements of lending institutions such as those offering mortgages and for applying for student loans.     A tax account transcript shows any later adjustments either you or the IRS made after the tax return was filed.  This transcript shows basic data, including marital status, type of return filed, adjusted gross income and taxable income.|`|bd094d9a9c35ca30309193105b2eff84aa	An Enrolled Agent can if he is authorized by IRS (most are), and if authorized by YOU.

The IRS loves to change the tax schedules each year. When does the interest rate pay its divedens weekly, monthly, or average daily balance?  also no bank that I have ever heard of pays a steady 5 percent interst anymore. Try money market accounts or savings bonds.  I do have an old dos program that I can run for you anyway?   ask question again and be specific.|`|fbcf5cfd2eaf4155c2206f6fa59da6d3aa	I will tell you how to do the math but you are gonna have to do it yourself cause I gotta get to bed.    Always remember the rule of 72  72 divided by the interest rate (5) = mean it would take 14.4 years for your money to double.    your adding money to the account each month and year so you math is alittle different but here is a example I just posted on someone elses question.    Citi offers 12% and you can contact your local primerica office about how to get it started.    anyways back to the 5% interest    say you started your account with 20,000$ in 14.4 years it would double to 40,000$ in 28.8 years it would double again to 80,000$ Keep in mind this is if you put 20,000 in and never touched it again.It would keep doubling every 14.4 years given that they played your money right. Cause they give you interest by playing it in stocks.   Now they are profressionals and they know how to play much better than we do but you might not earn 5% all the time that is the average that they can earn you. You could get more or less!    The reason I mentioned primerica is because they help people start retirement or saving accounts like this. And they are branched with Citi which is the largest bank in the world.     If you put in with them yielding 12%  20,000 would double in 6 years giving you 40,000 in 6 more years being 12 all together it would yeild you 80,000 and in 18 years all together 160,000 and in 24 years 320,000 Need I keep going!!    Good Luck      ETA: Also if it is for retirement and is put in with Citi the goverment doesn't touch it inless you withdrawl early then you are pentilized. If you wait till you retire you get your full amount. Roth plan is what I am talking about      Okay now that I have been to bed and gotten up and running again I worked the first year out for you.  5% annually =.4% monthly    500.00+.4% = 502.00 1st month  500.00 +50.00 +.4% = 554.21 2nd month  and so on with the math like that  3rd month 606.62  4th month 659.25  5th month 712.08  6th month 765.13  7th month 818.39  8th month 871.87  9th month 925.55  10th month 979.46  11th month 1033.57  12th month 1033.57 + 500.00 +.4% =1539.70    Then you would continue your math each month for 10 years! Hope this helps! Also remember this is what it would average out to if your money is put in every 30 days the bank goes off of what you have in your account on a daily basis so if you ad the 50$ close to then end of the month then you won't have aquired the full interest.

It is a waste of time and will cause you unhappiness.    If you choose to be suckered in and sign up to take surveys and receive, free trials considered you were warned. The minute you give them your credit card and personal information you have now opened your computer to unwanted cookies on your hard drive, annoying pop-up windows and if you are on a PC you open your computer to viruses that can wipe you out.    A lot of work to collect the "reward payments" that payout is not worth the effort over time. You will need to sign up for many types of offers, most of which require you to use a credit card. You start a week trial service with varies types of businesses or services, such as, an Internet service provider, book club, credit monitoring service, etc. to get your reward. If you don't cancel the trial, you end up being charged for the service and each service has different rules about how and when you can cancel. Very cumbersome!    Since you will need to sign up for at least a dozen offers before you get to $100 in rewards, it's very easy to forget what you have signed up for, or the problems you will have canceling in time to to be charged the full amount. The Cash Create recruiters you see here over exaggerate how much money you can earn because once you've done the high-dollar trials ($8-10 each), you are left with small rewards of a dollar or two. The survey business is not an efficient way to make money and you are more than likely to loose money in the end.

1660c2ea11d244c7d8010757656b59d5aa	Well, here are some ideas...  1.  If you like being around people you may consider some of the in-home party plans like Tupperware, Mary Kay, Tastefully Simple, etc.  You could schedule parties at times when your husband was home and could take care of your children.    2.  Check out the day care's in your area.  When my children were in day care almost all of their caregivers brought their own children to the day care center, this way they were earning money and were still able to see their children.    3.  Do you have something in your area that  isn't available in other areas of the country?  If so, sell it on eBay.  For example, I live in Omaha, where the College World Series is held every summer.  I always buy t-shirts and sell them on eBay, at least doubling my money.  I also sew things in  my home and sell them on eBay.  I recently sold 300 Christmas stockings!  Think about your talents and your area resources and I bet you'll come up with something you could sell.  4.  On the same lines as  2, check out the large churches in your area.  They usually hire child care providers for weekly Bible studies and they often will let you bring your children with you.   Bowling Alley's sometimes do the same.      Hang in there, I know it is hard when your children are little and money is limited, but don't let it get you down.  You sound like you have a real positive attitude about finding a solution and I admire you for wanting to stay with your children.  Remember to count your blessings!  Keep thinking, and keep asking around, and something will happen.|`|cbad6ad688eed70414909698cf551792aa	dancing, get it paid off in a week.|`|a0d8e357239999221131d3838f960f0caa	Here is a job you can do at home, set your own hours, and all you need is a computer and a phone.

20e212f08838f68bb11427ddd896613eaa	If you have an excellent credit rating, it will be easier to find a card with a decent credit limit and no annual fees,membership fees and other hidden fees. Just a plain Visa or Mastercard are the best. There are so many forms of these cards though you must watch out and read all the terms of agreement.    Not to long ago, some card company, contacted me and they used Visa's name but it was a card that had a limit of $7500.00 with no credit or employment checks. They wanted me to give them a check by phone for $159.00 which I refused to do until they sent me out the information in the mail. I went on the website they told me to go on, USA shop card.com and nothing came up. A company such as this gives you a credit line for products THEY SELL. What I know and most people don't know is whenever you buy a product, the purchaser should get at least 50% off the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price. What this card company did was charge the full MSRP and charge more for products hence-forth making all their money.    My Dad runs a Dental Equipment business and this involves buying products over the telephone by using a credit or debit card. He told me he tried to pay for a certain order with a Discover card and the company he was ordering from would not except that brand of card.    I use a debit card because it is handy, and when I'm out of money, I know I have spent enough for the month.|`|389101751f4e180560f4530a7d0e9718aa	I love my Wells Fargo mastercard.

All major companies have them, and you can pick what will best fit you (cash back, airline miles, gift certs etc).  Choose one with no annual fee, and the reward that best fits you.  Interest rate is usually higher on the cards, so pay your balance off each month.|`|ba817b21afbb7a0d76465185a48c78d4aa	Don't pay it off every month!  Check Google for Statute of Limitations Debt.  It will give you mostly American stuff broken down by state, so if you live another country you should type in Statute of Limitations Debt Lithuania, or whatever.  You'll probably find out that if you hide out for 3 to 6 years, depending on your location, you don't have to pay anybody anything, and credit reporting companies only go back 7 years.  Now the bad news.  Student loans guaranteed by the U.S. government are immortal.|`|051c28546e56b7070ea3e2ad4ebd5a67aa	With with citicard, they have the best rewards, and low interest.

708243493fdb462440c10c59d15c9c6eaa	In my state, you get certified after you are done with class. They count your supervised practice during the class as enough. You need to contact the state board of nursing to ask it. certification consists of a written test, then they pick 3 random skills to have you demenstrate compatence, like dressing, bathing, and taking a blood pressure. life care should pay for this, and takes about a day.What happens usually on a nursing home shift depends on the shift (is at morning, evening or night?) but in general, you will receive a patient assignment. You will make your rounds, check on them, and get fresh water pitchers for them. You will put up slips on the door to record inputs and out puts if ordered.. You will change diapers, you will assist with toileting. You will get residents dresses and out of bed, (its up to the nurse if you will do that) brush the teeth and other hygiene tasks. You will feed some of them, and pass trays (and record meal percentages). You may need to give up to 2 showers a day on the patient load you get. You will answer many call lights. You make take vital signs and record and report them to the nurse. Did I mention you may need to assist the nurse? And also you may have to turn bed bound patients on your assignment every 3 hours. How much of this, and how often, will depend on the shift and your patient assignment, which were usually 10 when I worked. Nursing home work is tough. But if you put your time in, you get to move onto hospitals, which are much easer, and less stressful, and in some cases only half the work. Hospital patients for the most part are not as dependent, and they dont often need shower just a partial bed bath, and can often move themselves with a lot less help

What that means is if you don't show up on the date you specified and by a certain time, they will charge your card for the room.  So yes your money is still available to spend unless you don't show up for the hotel reservation.|`|XCplTjycaa	In my experience, no.  That money is put on hold.  Depends on where you go to.  My brother and I went to Cancun last year and he made the mistake of reserving the room with his visa/debit card.  He then was in a position where he needed cash, and could not get it because the hotel had put a hold on his checking account for the amount of the stay.  Better double check on this with the hotel.  To play it safe, use a straight up credit card, DO NOT USE DEBIT.|`|b29569bed17f720c4c4c164ca1648f9faa	If you've put it down, unless you cancel the reservation the money is charged for that purpose to your card. If you cancel the transaction, you must wait for a credit on your statement for THAT 300 to be available. If you have additional money available on the card, you can use 300 of that in the meantime. Respectfully, please think about it. 300 on the card is 300 on the card whether you wait for a credit due to a cancellation of your reservation or use 300 from the money available on your credit line.|`|708243493fdb462440c10c59d15c9c6eaa	no, once the reservation is booked, it stayes on there. they also have a practice of putting a hold on your card once you book in for the hotel room charges (what they think it will amount to) and then once you check out, they acually take out the amount that you owe. they just put the hold on it to make sure they get paid.|`|0e3e321c3d599b5d4e152753fd35f625aa	Typically when you make a hotel reservation, your card isn't charged at the time the reservation is made, only when you check in and out.

It's helpful when taking this route in a career to get education of the subjects. Alot of employers in the medical field require that you are CCS(Certified Coding Specialist) or CCS-P(Certified Coding Specialist-Physician). You can't get these certifications without knowing ICD or CPT medical coding. It's not easy to learn either. You really have to be an investigator to find the right code for the right operation or right disease. I strongly advise taking some courses before getting your certifications.

I would stay completely away from them. Most are for commercial accounts anyway. Watch for special deals where you can get better interest rates and no charge for payoff each month on time. Some companies charge a service charge even when you pay them off on time. Ask questions and don't be intimidated. It's you money your playing with and some will act as though you owe them something for the right to have their card. You don't owe any of them anything as long as you pay on time. Don't use their monthly pay system if possible. Pay each months charges off as soon as you get the bills if at all possible. Otherwise you can be paying up to 30% interest and handling charges.|`|708243493fdb462440c10c59d15c9c6eaa	never get a card with a annual fee. with that said, chase gave me my first card, at 10%  but the credit line was only 500$ (they raised it later)|`|2f85f07877183d23cd803fead6698d5baa	visa, get a free visa|`|93ad7ffb91b59bc3388b5c962a281c5baa	Chase.... they have many credit card options, rewards, low rates, etc.|`|Ts0Alsh1aa	Best bank to get your first credit card from is the same as the best bank for your 2nd, 3rd, and 4th credit cards from.

So make sure you to come up with something ahead of time, so you're not caught off guard.    The "worst quality" question is obviously tougher to answer than "best quality" because you don't want to make yourself look bad. So think of some things you can turn around in your favor. For instance... you could say your worst quality is being a perfectionist. That is a bad quality since it can make your life stressful, but it's something that many prospective employers want to see in their people.    And be sure to do your homework on each of the companies BEFORE you interview. They'll always ask WHY do you want to work for them, and when you dazzle them with your research-based reasons, they will be very impressed.

f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	I work in management, it's unethical & illegal, your supervisor cannot discuss your work performance with your co workers.  You have grounds to file a personal grievance claim over this.  I suggest you see an employment lawyer.  You can tell them at the HR meeting about the supervisor telling other employees and that it is not legal.  Not sure what you mean re their reason for the HR meeting but sounds like they are being unreasonable & the job is affecting your personal safety.  You can point that out to them also.  Just stay calm & state your case, it doesn't sound like you are in the wrong here.  They sound like completely inexperienced management.  If they make notes during the meeting legally you may ask for a copy of them.  Make sure you write everything down that has happened so far & time & date it, like what time & day & which co worker told you you were going to be fired, etc (don't let your employer or co workers know you're doing this though - it's to show a lawyer as evidence of what's been happening).  You have more power if more than one person has said this to you as it means there were more witnesses to what your boss said.  You should also be allowed to bring a witness to the meeting, this could be anyone that agrees to come, they don't have to work there.  Also people have to fire you without vindictiveness & your boss has said "she's going to try & get you fired" which implies a witch hunt mentality & this is not legal.|`|da86f8cc895bbc843e25c0863032ec30aa	This is just unethical.

However, you may need to provide proof of insurance before you're able to drive it off the lot, which definitely DOES require a license.    One thing that you can do, is just receive a loan from a local credit union. Whether not you can receive one is definitely dependent on your current credit rating. You can find out your credit score (for a fee) at www.myfico.com. Generally, you'd want your credit score to be above 600, which is possible even with a discharged bankruptcy.    My recommendation? Go to a local used car dealership and ask. Couldn't hurt to try. Worst case scenario, get a co-signer.|`|c4e1d8ad9c66493e38628df8cc97641faa	No, because you have to have proof of insurance to buy a car and you can't get insurance without a license.|`|708243493fdb462440c10c59d15c9c6eaa	you can try co-singing for him, if you have decent credit. this is where the car will be in his and your name and he will make the payments. but know this, if he does not make the payments, they will make you pay, and if the title is in his name too, you may have no recourse to get the car back. the only other option you have is to get a personal loan.|`|4f3e1f3b7edc66c705b39d6dd80d728faa	Well you usually need some ID when you get a loan, I would think it would be hard to get any loan without a license.

708243493fdb462440c10c59d15c9c6eaa	it depends on the state. there are laws that can require the employer to pay. this is the law in my state.    How often does an employer have to pay its employees?     The employer has to pay its employees at least twice per month, no longer than sixteen days apart and payment of the wages must be within five of the employers working days after the pay period ends. School Districts may withhold wages during their normal two week payroll processing cycle. Employers whose payroll systems are centralized outside the state of Arizona may pay their employees no later than ten days after the end of the pay period.     check with the industrial commission in your area. you can tell them you don't want them to get in trouble because of the laws, but if you don't want to cause trouble, and the moneys not there, you will just have to accept it as it is. you can always ask them to pay what little they can when they can.|`|1491fcc7e45653dc1f288492d94d3dddaa	I personally would say "Sir, I really love what I do here, and you are a killer boss,  But I really need to be payed on a more regular basis."

If you are adamant about the work... see how you can do it on your own.  Self employment is ultimate freedom... but you need to stick with being motivated.

Ignore her when she speaks and just get on with what you were saying.    Don't Blink.|`|d8i5RWcRaa	Dear Tuesday,    It strikes me funny that there are no provisions in your SOP's in regards to employees who are displaying mediocre job performance, or creating a hostile work environment. Surely your company has had to address this issue at some time.     If you're not receiving any support from your bosses, that certainly makes your job that much more difficult.     I think the deal about someone "going to the union" is pretty much a cop-out.  It's just people trying to avoid taking responsibility for a rogue employee.     I honestly think you need to pull this employee in behind closed doors and take total control.  Do not allow that employee to speak until you are done speaking.  This puts the control in your ballpark and not hers.  Secondly, relate your company SOP's to her and state that a hostile work environment is not acceptable. Secondly, tell her exactly when breaks and lunches will be taken, and that she is not an exception. Tell her that if she takes her breaks and lunches other than the times you prescribe, it will be documented.  Tell her also that you, as manager, will be observing her work performance. And if it is not up to par with the other employees who ARE doing their jobs, that too, will be documented.     As for her excessive questions....it seems that she does not even know her job.  Give her your company SOP manual or training manual and have her read it.  Each section of that manual needs to be read.  And after she reads it, have her sign a document stating that she read and understood it.  If she refuses to do so, tell her that you will document her refusal to receive instruction on her job functions.  Make sure whatever you document has dates, times and descriptions of any conversation you have with her.  Also, make personal copies for your records.     If this does not work, take your compiled documents of your dealings with her to your superiors.  Tell them you have copies for yourself also.  Tell them that they need to take action on her regardless of any union related reprocussions.  If they refuse, then submit your documents up the channels.     If you still receive no satisfaction, then I suggest that YOU contact YOUR union representative, and submit a hostile work environment complaint and let them investigate it.  Which would look better for your bosses?  Dealing with an unproductive worker and resolving the problem?  OR dealing with a hostile work environment complaint by an employee with an exemplary record?  You decide!      Best wishes to you!|`|708243493fdb462440c10c59d15c9c6eaa	document, document, document. have at least 2 sit downs or what ever the company handbook says you have to do and come up with a plan of improvement for her, and have her sign it each time. when document it again when she fails to improve, and have her sign it. take it to management, and get her out.|`|AA12379441	remain hmble and just look at them and be thankful you are not like that person. stay sweet and that will overcome her lonely self.  she only knows her miserable self. so don't let her take your sweetness away.|`|bed19f6512ca6b59fb60b435725b3342aa	Easy.. if yer in charge..

Before suggesting one, let me congratulate u first for getting a chance to manage a team.    Now, that stubborn girl doesn't know the importance of rules & regulation... that's for sure. She thinks, she can break it anytime she wants. Warn her twice (written & a copy with u) that u will pull her to union. If she can take aback up support of the union, u too can. Let her mind know this well.  Definitely a few moments (Days) later, u'll get a chance to pull her to the union officials. Before that, let the union know about the things may be just same as you have put a question here.    Let a letter from the union to present herself be given to her. Take union in your confidence before she does so.    These things will gradually create documents against her to now act on it.  The legal actions to suit the situation will definitely let her mind learn that u r always superior to her. No the physical strength but the power of the 'post' & 'position' rules the big company. So, use your authorities more that her arrogance. Let your leadership qualities work on her like this just by using your authorities & this will make all other team mates also to understand your strength as the team lead or team manager.    In short, use ur authorities, document the things on paper/mails, and use them against her & all these before she does it.    All the Best.  Wish you Happy working with the members.|`|f3f0aa51ec7c8c53a8bf7fb9a68dc174aa	Pull her into a meeting with you and her union steward.

If her way isnt getting in the way or getting the work done, then it shouldnt matter as long as its getting done and its getting done right. But yes this can get annoying, best thing to do is talk to her simple as that.

You can get some services for low fees and full service for higher fees. If you want the full service it's often 6% of the sales price charged from the Seller's proceeds.  The commission is generally split 4 ways by the Agents who will work to get your home sold.  The Agent that takes your listing is called "Listing Agent"  they work for a Broker, in this case called the "Listing Broker" these two have an agreement about who gets what percentage of the total 3% that comes into the office based upon the activities of the "Listing Agent".  It often is 40% or less to the Broker and 60% or more to the Agent.    Then there is the Selling Agent and the Selling Broker who employes them.  They have a similar agreement about who will take what percentage of the 3% that comes into their office.   Again 60-40% is an common split.     Be sure to get referrals from friends and family for the Agent that they used and were happy with.  This is by far the best way to get top notch service.    Best of luck,|`|AwLHLTGVaa	Hi,    There is No Standard Commission. Basicially it is what ever you wish it to be. Keep in mind there are (2) parts to a commission, the Listing side and the Buyers Agent if one is involved. This is the idea behind the "For Sale By Owner" program. Basically you pay a one time Listing Fee, aprox $400 and then you decide what you want to pay for a Buyers Agent Commision if an agent is involved.

It means you just have to pay a flat fee to be in the MLS. This will eliminate the "Listing Agent commission". It is only important to let Buying Agents or Selling Agents know that you are willing to pay a commission and they will help you sell it to their buyers. Now you only have to provide for the Buying agents commission(usually 2-3%) plus a flat fee($299.95) for the listing agent. Imagine the savings you can get.

You may get disability or SSI payments (although you're going to have to pay down some of your assets before you do).      I would speak to a financial advisor to see if investing your money would be advisable.|`|QH42mrP0aa	I trust    Ing Direct..  www.ingdirect.com    This is where my retirement is.. I have a cd here and also my savings account.  Right now they are in the top running for the highest interest rates.  They have availablilies for you to purchace cd's, ira's and other money saving programs.  You may think about putting some in an IRA it I believe would help lower your tax owed.    You should be able to get disability.  If you get a letter from them saying you don't qualify, they are lying and you know it.  They most always send a no letter out first.  Just in case you believe them.  You may need a disablility lawyer that takes no money from you until you get paid your first disability back payment check.    Other banks online like Bank of America may have better interest rates.. I'd trust Bank of America also but I know ING DIRECT..   What is good about them is I can watch it online and I can transfer money from home.  It usually takes a day or two to get money from Ing to my bank account but it is ok.. It does take 5 or more days for your money you put in Ing each time to be available to you but that helps me save more.  Your limited also on the amount of withdrawals each month which is also good if you want to save.  Ing saving interest right now is 4.50%  I think a 12 month cd is 5.10%    if you go to ing direct look aroung for tools and tips button and there is a calculator there that you can put in the money you would want to save and the % you get on interest and how long you will be saving and it will tell you how much you will make.  Good luck...  P.S.  your local banks will not give you an interest rate like these savings banks and credit unions can.  P.S.S.  I went and did a calculation for you just for you to see..  on the savings account with ing... your 103000.00 @ 4.50% interest and 360 months can earn you $385,768.01    so even if you live off some of the interest each month at least you have access to it and no one will loose it in a stock market...|`|KpDFKKVMaa	if you "speculate" there is always the risk of the investment group "arsing up". Use a large percentage of your money to invest in CD bonds from your bank -     even though the interest is low, you are guaranteed a return. Remember also about wholesale interest rates and negotiate the rate of interest. Banks are able to negotiate, just that hardly anyone asks them.     Take a little of the money and open an online business (solves immobility issues) - eBay being one of the fastest, safest and less duplicitous of interactive trading. There are alot of unscrupulous people on the net who would be only too happy to part you from your cash and flood you with emails about how they found the "perfect, once in a lifetime" opportunity - dont be fooled - I think that if your going to have to work do something that you enjoy and something that makes you happy. That'll kill time before social security gets back to you.    Dont forgive to give to charities - we are all connected in one way or another.    Failling that - you could always move to New Zealand, we have a social health policy so need to worry about medications, homehelp and huge doctor bills.hehehe

Ive been a Cardiac Nurse for 4yrs and just recently changed over to Nephrology Nursing.  I had financial success but was away from my baby too much, so I decided to find a way to make good money and be home with my family (or travel to see him).  I started my Mary Kay business10 days after signing papers on a new home and 15 days after starting a new job.  Needless to say I was scared.  Now with my Mary Kay business only 5 months old I have a larger income than a nurse & the freedom of being my own boss.  My hourly income easily out weighs my income as a nurse, I average about $67.00-$73.00 per hour!!!!  Id love to speak more about this amazing opportunity with you.

HczIUZFiaa	The truth is, according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, information doesn't have to be kept on you for any length of time.  The FCRA provides that information can be kept for no longer than 7 years for most things and no longer than 10 years for things like bankruptcy.  However the FCRA does not REQUIRE that information be stored at all.  There is no State in the United States either that REQUIRES this information be kept on you.  In fact the FCRA provides many remedies to remove information from your credit file at any time.  This is why credit restoration companies have so much success.  They know the laws in the FCRA and know how to use them.  If you want to see the FCRA you can go to this link:  http://nwbusinessadvisors.com/fcra.aspx and you can read the entire set of laws.|`|31b9d943eeebee817b486384aaf5dc76aa	Well, there really isn't ONE answer for all of your questions, because the laws vary on some things.

Besides, because of your deficiency,you may be unable to convey everything required for the job which you might be knowing otherwise because of time-constraints.Also,let me tell you,there is a certain amount of Bias existing against those who cannot speak good English in the community who may be presumed to be uncouth, merely for this reason.

This one lady was supposed to start a management training type thing and she was not as mature as I was.  I was older and paid more attention to detail than she did.  She was there longer than me though.  Well when it came time for her to start training, boss lady decided that she would rather put me in that spot.  It caused a big mess.  I was treated like dirt from all the folks that liked that other lady.  You have to do what you have to do.    You can either tell your boss or ignore them they will go away.  If you don't act out on what they are doing to you then they aren't getting anything from it and will stop.  They are like 7 yr olds that are still having fits if they can't get their way.  When mom or dad stops reacting to them they don't throw fits anymore.   Your husband is a goof he should be supporting you not tearing you down with those other people you work with.  Good Luck.. Hold your head high and don't let them bother you.  But let them know you think they are being really childish.  That will make them feel 5 inches tall.  LOL

Here are some other suggestions while you are job searching:    Networking - Register at your local Unemployment Office (you don't need to be on unemployment to register for their assistance). They often will have networking groups on a regular basis. They also are a good source for the jobs that never show up in the paper or online.    Check your local paper -- In many cases the paper's classified are now online.    Search Smart Online -- If you don't have a lot of time, spend most of your time at sites that aggregate the job feeds from several job search engines. Prominently these include indeed.com and thingamajob.com.    Organization -- I use a free online application that allows you to track your ads, jobs you apply for, send or print mail merged correspondence, and track your job search history. This site is jobsearchlog.com and it has been very useful to me, please go and check it out!

Doing so for a profit is all about buying at the right price and managing the improvements so that you deliver on time and on budget. You also have to know your market so that you do not end up sitting on the property after the work is done.    Get in, get the right work done and get out.    There are a number of books on the topic. Many people do this sort of work full time as their only source of income. There are a number of risks so do your homework.    There are tax implications and other details that you need to consider.|`|QH42mrP0aa	well yes you can..   it is best to get a loan buy a house and fix it up to sell it before the first note is due.  Or pay cash and fix it up and up it back on the market for profit.    You would need to do your research for the type of house and neighborhood you're looking into before you do the remodeling so you don't over fix.    So say you buy a house in a middle class neighborhood for 80,000 and most of the houses in that area and size sale for say 120,000 all fixed up you don't want to do so much fixing up that the 80,000 dollar home you just bought will out price all of the houses in that area.  You may not get your money back.      Gooddd Luckkk|`|9JV4Z7Pjaa	Absolutely... Different states have laws to follow to accomplish this however, you can absolutely buy a house today for a dollar and sell it next week for 5 bucks.  Keep your receipts on all renovations to prove the revised value.  Often times a buyers bank will also requests documentation, so when you flip be prepared to dance.  Documentation is the key to a successful investment such as this.
QH42mrP0aa	you will just have to do your research on the different brokerage companies with in the area you wish to work in.  After you find out everything you can about them, you should way the good and bad about all of them and then go see if the one you chose is needing another relator.|`|ab6c137a2865f6a61d2c2280e5b8959caa	Congratulations! Don't know how long you've been an agent, but have you been keeping up with the continuing education requirements?    There is no best brokerage in any state. Each one has it's own good and bad things to consider. Usually in the classified ad section in the local newspaper the companies indicate if they are looking for new agents.    Large company may have more time for training, but that doesn't mean it will translate into more and bigger sales. You may want to sit onsite for a builder for a few months to get the hang of the business, because if you mess up too badly, both you and your broker can lose your license for a period of months.

hCdCxaVcaa	Yes, join the yearbook committee, and get any writing and reporting experience you can.    There are plenty of journalism courses at colleges and universities. However, lots of journalists choose to study English Literature or History instead, and specialise later on.    It is much more important to get experience than to get academic qualifications in journalism. You're just 16, so start with your yearbook or whatever. In a year or two, see if you can start writing features for your local paper or school magazine.     If you go on to university, join the student paper there. In your final year, apply for internships at local and national newspapers and magazines.    If you don't go to university, you may be able to get a job on a local paper right away. Be prepared to work very hard!    Lots of skills are important for journalists, but principally these:  - writing (excellent spelling, grammar, clarity etc)  - analysis  - communication  - meeting new people  - enterprise  - fearlessness  - investigative interest  - ambition  - general knowledge  - strong interests in/knowledge of specific subjects, for instance politics, economics, sports, fashion etc    If you're good at those things, it's worth giving it a go!

0ijgxxczaa	I have been making money on internet for 4 years and I was personally scammed by a good many making money methods.Finally,I found the most legitimate, effective and fast way for beginner to make money is doing paid surveys if you have a computer with Internet access and can sit at your computer for 1.5-3 hours per day.    But before joining a paid survey network, you should be sure that the paid survey company satisfies the following minimum requirements:   1. In business for at least 1 year.   2. Well organized, easy to navigate directories.   3. Directories updated at least weekly.   4. Helpful resources available for newcomers.   5. No "waiting period". Eligible immediately..

AA10855784	Q. What kind of breaks do I get? Are breaks and lunches required by law?     A. Mandatory break laws apply only to minors under the age of 18. Company policy dictates break and lunch periods for anyone over the age of 18. Minors under the age of 18 must be given a thirty (30) minute meal period after five (5) consecutive hours of work.   http://www.state.nj.us/labor/lsse/lsgenf...      Good place for questions like this:  http://www.laborlawtalk.com/    If they don't have immediate answers, they will direct you to them.   Not a bunch of yahooligans guessing.|`|AA11947583	if you mean 2 hours, than no break is probably neccesary but if your talking about 14 hours than you should probably get at least a half hour lunch break usually unpaid but thats law in maryland, i woudl contact a labor board or better buisness beaurer or something like that|`|067543fcab755dff074a22a7ec9840fcaa	Most places I worked I think it is around 2 or 3 hours.  If I worked 4 hours I got one 15 minute break after 2 hours.  If I worked 8 then it was two 15 minute breaks and a lunch either 1/2 or full hour depending on place of employment.

JyX3nQ1Zaa	what craft?
JyX3nQ1Zaa	most employers give raises after(if not before)  90 days. I would ask why you have not recieved more money. ask them what you need to do to improve your value to them. if you dont get a solid answer, its time to move on to a job that can,; and will apreciate you and your loyalty. good luck.|`|AA10503825	Only you can know the answer to that.  There is usually nothing wrong with putting together a proposal for your supervisor.    Outline your accomplishments, and contributions to the store, and let them know that you are worth more.    Don't paint yourself into a corner however.  Too many people walk in to a meeting, and say "pay me more or I'm leaving".  They might not be able to pay your more.    Be professional, and you never know what could happen!!    Good Luck!!|`|xwWr9Fh8aa	I would wait until you have been at the job for at least 90 days and then, if you have not been given a raise, I would ask for one.  If they do not give you one, and you have done a good job, stick with the job until the 1 year point, then look for another job.  Be sure to leave on good terms and get the reference for future positions.
wKjBUTbfaa	This is fraud, and can equal a great deal of jail time if the bank itself finds out, not just you-- they will prosecute.  Since you don't want this person to do jail time, but you're worried about your money, it's logical to open a new bank account.  $2,000 is a lot of money, and had it been my account I would have warned this family member to stop, and if he/she didn't I would get into a legal issue with getting the money back, but NOT to send them to jail.  Passwords, pin numbers, and debit/credit card numbers are an important thing to keep private. Be more careful with them!|`|JyX3nQ1Zaa	personally, i would close the account. open a new one. let the person know that (someone) has been robbing you and that if it continues you will seek prosicution on that person. if it contenues, file charges.|`|UJkGrLXYaa	I have a close friend who this happened to. She closed that account and opened a new one. since she lived with the person who was taking money from her, she had her bank account information and billing information sent to my house so that her family member would not be able to get the account number, but you can open a p.o. box at the post office to get important information mailed to you. If the person is aware that you know, you could try to arrange some sort of schedule for them to pay you back. However, if this is impossible, you might just have to settle for making yoru accounts much more private, and making this person gradually earn your (incomplete) trust back. If the person is not aware that you know, you may want to confront them. This person may have a compulsive addiction to shopping or some other vice (gambling?) that they need the money for.  This person may need psychological help. Otherwise, I think it is important that this person knows that you have found out about the stealing. Things are going to have to change in order to prevent it from continuing to happen, and these changes will not go unnoticed by the person who is stealing. It will be easier if you let them know that you know what they have been up to.

Ovviamente risulter seconda casa e quindi dovrai pagare tutte le tasse di conseguenza.  Le scritture private lasciano il tempo che trovano. un domani per far valere una scrittura privata, se le cose tra te e il tuo compagno non dovessero funzionare, devi andare per avvocati e ti lascio immaginare cosa andrai a spendere col rischio poi di perdere anche la causa.  Una soluzione potrebbe essere che la casa la compra lui e lascia l'usufrutto a te oppure, visto che aanche lui dovrebbe tutelarsi un minimo, lui proprietario e usufruttuari entrambi al 50%.  E' un escamotage ovviamente.

So I have no interest here.    Depending upon what's in your credit, you would want to consider FHA.  FHA has no credit score requirement, better rates and if you combine it with the buyersfund downpayment grant program, the loan can be structured so that it is 100% financing.    FHA also allows manufactured/mobile homes.  However they must be on their own land.  There are other requirements too, but this is definitely the biggest.    visit my site www.johnleblanconline.com Again, I have no vested interest in this and can give you honest advice.

777abd0a88c542a029db43895ca6ebf3aa	Hi,       If I were young, I would be investing in small cap growth mutual funds or stocks.  Go here for excellent low cost advice (http://www.aaii.com/aaiiportfolios/comme...       Don't be alarmed at the low cost - it has some of the best financial advice on the Web.         You have lots of time before retirement which means the magic of compound interest will just keep building and building.  It really works and if you keep investing every year, in 10 or 15 years you will be surprised at how it mounts up.  In 30 years you could be a millionaire which probably won't amount to much in 30 year owing the the ravages of inflation.      By that time you will need a money manager like Fisher Investments to manage your money - probably before when you reach the $500,000 mark.      And that's the primary reason to keep investing in small cap growth stocks - they will flog inflation to death.       When investing in mutual funds, select the no-load funds only.  Do not invest in mutual funds with a "load", an up front commission that you have to pay before when they sell you the mutual fund.  Some charge as much as 10% which is a rrip-off.  Many studies have shown that the no-load funds do as well as the load funds and sometimes a lot better.       Look at the AAI Shadow Stock Portfolio.  I would try and emulate that portfolio if you want to invest in stocks.  It was up 25% as of November 2006.  The Vanguard Index fund is only up 14%.       AAII has some of the best financial advisers and the cost is very low.   They have excellent guides and advice.      You may need a broker so go to e-Trade or Scottsdale who have low commission rates.       Do your own due diligence.  Your own ideas are the best.  Do not depend on someone else to select investments for you.  Learn about investing so you don't have to ask what stocks to invest in.         Be self reliant.         Remember what Emerson said:  A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do.       Find stocks that have steadily rising net profits (earnings), low debt, and good P/Es, lots of cash, companies buying back their stock..       What interests you?  Find stocks that pique your interest and passion.      You need fast growing good stocks with good earnings and in good sectors.  You need to learn more about the stock market before you even think about investing in it.      The stocks world is divided into 12 sectors such as energy which chevron belongs to.  It is next to last in the sectors list today.       Technology is numero uno, but things can change in a new york minute, but within the sector, the fastest growing are computer services, not Microsoft.  Then,  Electronic Instruments and controls.  Next is computer storage devices.       The next hot sector is Healthcare, but heed the warning below.  Go here for sectors:  (http://clearstation.etrade.com/cgi-bin/I...

First of all, stay away from "professional brokers" and tips coming to you via e-mail or friends and acquaintances.   And tips at Yahoo! Answers.  And e-mail tips.  Do your own due diligence - don't rely on someone else.  Read Emerson's essay "Self Reliance.       Hey!  They will say anything to get you to buy their junk.  If it's too good to be true, it is.       Remember this, they are just sales people trying to sell you what their firm is pushing.  They are not security analysts or financial planners, not even financial advisers.  Trust me, I know from experience that they cannot be trusted especially with a million dollars.  You risk losing it all.  A million dollar account is known as a "whale" and they would love to get their greedy little paws on it and suck it dry.  They just want to make commissions on what they buy and sell for the suckers, err...clients..       Get this book:  The Market Gurus: Stock Investing Strategies You Can Use from Wall Street's Best (Paperback)   by John P. Reese (Author), Todd O. Glassman        Risk avoidance is the name of the game.       Remember, the harder I work, the luckier I get.         Penny stocks are highly speculative.  I would avoid the ones under a dollar a share.  For example, Best Buy started at less than $5.  So there are some good companies, but it takes a lot of digging to find the good ones.  You are looking for companies with good earnings, little debt, low capitalization, and good P/Es.  For stocks under $5, very few will meet these requirements.       Stay away from the pharms unless they have patented drugs - do not invest in generic pharms,  no growth there.      Check out which business sectors are the most popular and invest in the companies in those sectors.  The number one, two and three are:  technology, health care, and cyclicals (retail).  These change periodically so keep current.       Go here for a list of growth stocks:  http://www.thestreet.com/_googlen/newsan...

xLTci036aa	Depending on the job. What are you applying for? One mistake people do is having one resume for all jobs. You should place emphasis on the skills that would be more pertinent  to the job position you are applying for. e.g if you are applying for an administrative or clerical position then the front desk position would be more relevant. If you are applying for restaurant manager or head hostess...both the Frontdesk and waiting tables would be relevant. You should elaborate on what you did at those jobs that would make you make you a shoe in for the job you are applying.

OtIdm3Oraa	Consider the return on investment: if the condition of the asset is questionable, a lease is preferable because you have the option of walking away after an agreed upon time period (term).      If the condition of the asset is expected to remain stable indefinitely or increase in value over time, then a purchase makes sense because you have a chance to sell at a higher price.    Simple rule of thumb: BUY appreciating assets, LEASE depreciating assets.
naL774iBaa	Yes there is a difference in the tax liability.    The net income of a S corporation is taxable to the shareholders in the year earned.  While C corporations income is only taxable to the shareholders when a dividend is paid out.  The C corporation owes taxes each year on it's earnings and is tax as a business.  Paying it's liability out of corporate resources.|`|5tvdSzXnaa	The primary difference between and S Corp and a C Corp is the way in which earnings of the owners are treated by the IRS.    Both organizations provide "limited liability" this means that the company is established as an independant entity. The business stands alone from its owners... this is good mainly if the business were to be sued -     The main disadvantage to the C corp is the possibility of double taxation. Unlike a S corp the C corp must pay its tax at the corporate level and may not pass through the gains or losses to the owners.     Then, if a distribution is made to the owners, the owners must recognize this distribution as income and again pay a tax.     Whereas - S Corp may pass through earnings to its owner(s) thus it is only taxed once.
acf360b5372f1274d013803b76cdb74baa	This is impossible to answer because it depends on the terms of line/loan. Generally speaking a personal loan with a fixed monthly payment will be a better deal if you are on a fixed budget and plan to pay a fixed amount compared to a line of credit.  With a personal loan, payments HAVE TO BE MADE when due but with a line of credit you pay what you can so if you are not sure that you will have the money when the personal loan payment is due you are better off with the credit line. Missing a personal loan payment WILL be reported to you credit history.|`|OtIdm3Oraa	it all depends on the interest rate you negotiate with your bank and how it is compounded.  it's tough to answer this question without knowing those variables.|`|AA11713768	It depends on the term (length) of the loan, and the interest rate you get.

AA11364504	I have been an Aide for the past three and a half years. Personally, I enjoy caring for people. Being caring is a gift from the heart. I have enjoyed my job for the most part. The nursing home I worked at had a fun working environment, and that made my work even more appealing.  However, my fiance and I had to relocate to another city, and sadly, I left my job. I'm now working at another nursing home in a new city and unfortunately their level of care overall is a bit below my expectations. Whereas I'm used to a lower ratio of aide to patient, this one has a higher ratio and that means less personal one on one care, it seems a bit disorganised, half the time, supplies are missing, the laundry does not supply much needed linen on time and and sadly its sanitory standard are below par (in my opinion).   I've found myself re-evaluating my profession. If I can't participate in my profession, giving the best care I can, in a good, clean, sanitory environment, I would rather not participate at all. I love caring for people but I also hate seeing people suffer knowing I cannot do anything to better their pain.  So, I guess in the course of my aide career, I have realised that there are good nursing homes willing to make sure their patients are taken care of, and there are those that want to make money but spend less on amenities needed to care for their patients.     I still believe aides are of great value to the nursing profession. Hats off to all Aides!!

Ricordati inoltre che l'esperienza ripaga molto quindi se lavori bene in una piccola azienda magari dopo qualche anno riuscirai a rivenderti con maggiori requisiti e a quel punto sarai presa in considerazione pi o come un laureato.

If the people living there have the keys, they aren't trespassing and calling the police won't get them out.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Legally, the people in the house are trespassing and it only takes a phone call to the local police to get them out. Don't call 911 because its not a life or death emergency.     The bottom line is they are on the property without permission from the property owner, that's trespassing. It doesn't matter if the daughter in law told them they could live there...She doesn't own the property so she has no legal right to give permission for someone to live there.     You need to simply insist that the landlord provide the property to you as agreed, this is his/her problem. If the landlord doesn't provide you with the property, they can't keep any of your money. You should also insist on a walk-through with the landlord when you get your keys. If anything is damaged make sure you document it and take pictures with a camera that inscribes the date right onto the photo image.     If I were the landlord, I'd knock on the door and inform the squatters that they have 2 hours to vacate or else I'll call the police and have them arrested for trespassing.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	In most states, if someone moves into a house without the owner's permission, that person is guilty of trespassing and perhaps other things.

If you're in India I  would suggest you  set up a website(free) and advertise Indian products such as saris, traditional pottery or jewery you get in the local market & sell it through the website. You can actually also do it through ebay.   1. Its not costly for you coz you only buy the stuff when someone orders.  2. Cheap for the buyer coz there is no middleman  3. You don't pay anyone and get all the profits.  4. You can grow as a business if all goes well    Or if you just want to sign up for different offers you can go to       http://www.treasuretrooper.com/109733     Its a site I'm signed up to & its free. You sign up for different offers (make sure you choose ones that are free)& get small money like $1 or $2 per offer & 1 offer may take you 5minutes. Not much money but something is better than nothing plus you get to participate in tresure hunt which starts at $100.

AA11397626	It is very unlikely that you will find any country or organization willing to give you 15 million US dollars, especially as you do not know of a project that will benefit your own country or fill a desperate need there.      If your children are in the secondary schools, the most common avenue to help them in their education is to pay for their "tuition studies" during likizo.  If they have been able to do a revision and cover all of their topics outside of the school, then the NECTA  exams will be relatively easy and they will score well.      If a student gets a Division One on the NECTA for Form Six, it is quite possible that the universities in Tanzania will pay for all of the education (except for application and matriculation).    If you are determined that your children will leave your home, they likely can study abroad in Moscow (Russia) at the Friends University.  Two of my former students are currently studying PCB university classes there, and they are getting a *very* good education.    If the goal is to support your family's education, do not begin by asking for a loan that would cost more than their entire education.  (The amount you are asking about is beyond the cost of 20 people's university education in Europe or America!)  If you have a project idea which will benefit Tanzania very much, then your goal should be that project.  The foreigners (you call us "wazungu") who are in Tanzanian kuishi wanajitolea normally, and your immediate goal should be that selflessness.

mEZgx3jaaa	El Peso Convertible o Nuevo Peso Argentino (Smbolo: $, ISO 4217: ARS) es la actual moneda nacional de la Repblica Argentina. Esta moneda reemplaz en 1992 al Austral, cada peso equivala a 10.000 australes.    Comenz a circular el 1 de enero de 1992 bajo la llamada Ley de Convertibilidad de 1991. Desde entonces y hasta el 7 de enero de 2002, tuvo un valor monetario igual a 1 dlar estadounidense por peso. Pero a partir de la derogacin de la Ley de Convertibilidad bajo el gobierno de Eduardo Duhalde, debido a la fuerte crisis poltica y econmica, se ha visto devaluado su valor hasta el tipo de cambio actual, cercano a los 3 pesos por dlar, con un mximo histrico de 4,01 el 26 de junio de 2002.    Actualmente se emiten monedas de 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 centavos, y 1 peso, y billetes de 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, y 100 pesos. Esta lnea monetaria es la vigente desde el a?o 1992. Los billetes de un peso fueron sustituidos en 1994 por monedas del mismo valor. La lnea de billetes tiene dos versiones, la primera que dej de tener vigencia en diferentes fechas segn los valores, $2 el 26 de noviembre de 1997, $5 el 22 de junio de 1998, $10 el 14 de enero de 1998, $20 el 18 de enero de 2000, $50 el 19 de julio de 1999, $ 100 el 3 de diciembre de 1999.En el nuevo dise?o, que fue apareciendo a medida que salan de circulacin los diferentes valores, tienen todos el mismo tama?o. Se redise? todo el billete, manteniendo la imagen de los prceres elegidos, con un fondo cada uno donde se insertan rplicas de manuscritos o escenas alusivas al personaje . En la mayora de los casos, es difcil encontrar monedas de 1 centavo, ms an si estas se buscan fuera de la ciudad de Buenos Aires.     Billetes del Peso Convertible.A partir de la derogacin de la Ley de Convertibilidad se dej de llamar a la moneda de argentina "Peso Convertible de curso legal" para ser llamada simplemente Peso. La Ley N 25.561[1], del 6 de enero de 2002, en su art. 3 deroga los arts. 1 y 2 de la Ley de Convertibilidad (que fijaban que el peso fuera convertible en dlares estadounidenses en paridad uno a uno), por lo que se dispuso suprimir el vocablo "convertibles" en los billetes de la actual lnea monetaria.  La calidad de impresin de los billetes de Peso Convertible o Nuevo Peso Argentino est al mismo nivel de calidad tcnica y artstica que los producidos en las mejores casas de moneda del mundo. Todas las medidas de seguridad estn presentes en los billetes: marca de agua, tinta pticamente variable (los billetes de $20, $50 y $100 cuentan con una roseta a la derecha de la marca de agua, impresa en tinta que cambia del color verde al azul si se inclina el billete), motivo complementacin frente-dorso (realizado en offset); microletra ; identificacin para ciegos; imagen latente; hilo de seguridad; impresin en tinta invisible (en los billetes de $50 y $100, solo visible con luz ultravioleta).

bb05e16645e8c6a2f0d28d7efe710f87aa	As long as you always pay your bills on time, never go over the limit, and keep your balance about 45% or lower it will make you have great credit. It's good if you can pay big portions of your bill each month, but it's not a really realistic or common thing.     I'd say just pay a little bit over the minimum (say, your minimum is 40.00, you could pay 50.00) as soon as possible, you'll have your card on good standing and your credit will gradually go up.     And don't charge your cards if you don't need to! It's not free money to buy things, you'll eventually have to pay it it all back WITH interest.|`|AA11249458	The actual size of your budget is irrelevant in impacting your credit.  What gives you "bad credit" is spending more than you have and then having trouble paying it back.

As a professional recruiter I can tell you that there are three areas that never go down in salaries and are not always pursued by the masses.  First is the medical field for which you are educating yourself.  Second is the accounting field which a lot of people go to but do not enjoy.  Third is the Information technology arena.  The highest paid technology side is the Medical IT field as these people are hard to find, they make a large contract dollar and generally only have to work from 6 to 9 months out of a year.      Good luck and of course my suggestion is Medical IT.|`|43af235f95ec4af6738a77d6e2c4cdc6aa	Please take it from me...there are some people in this world who can do anything for money and cope and be okay with it...if you're asking this question..you're like me and not one of those people.  it's taken me a long time to figure out what i want to do but i finally have something that i enjoy and don't mind doing..i'll make a living but will probably never be rich...    but my point is, to pick something that you both like learning about all the time and that you don't mind or love to do.  You may not find something that really interests you but chances are the things you buy books on or pursue in your spare time are the things that will captivate your attention for the long haul.  First access your strengths  then access what you can handle (stress, physical limitations, hours)  and then access your work ethic and how well you learn and your ability to learn...    after you've answered all these questions truthfully you should come up with a handful of careers that will be right for you.  don't be upset if they aren't epic or the path to a millionaire existence  do what you love and do what you do naturally.    |`|poRh5QHJaa	Nursing pays the bills, but is not a high-paying job.

If you do not derive any satisfaction from the job, then do not pursue nursing.    If you are picturing yourself working in downtown, then you are imagining an office career, perhaps banking, financial services such as insurance, accounting, legal, etc.  Try to pursue a business major rather than nursing.

Sie sagt sich: "Selbst ist die Frau!" und baut ihn selber, natrlich ohne Probleme, zusammen. Kaum hat sie ihn fertig da hingestellt, f?hrt drau?en vor der Wohnung die Stra?enbahn vorbei und der Schrank klappt in sich zusammen. Was solls, denkt sich die Frau und baut ihn nochmals zusammen, wieder f?hrt die Stra?enbahn unten vorbei und wieder klappt der Schrank zusammen. Entnervt ruft die Frau bei IKEA an und sagt: "Schicken sie bitte einen Techniker vorbei, ansonsten bringe ich das Ding noch heute zurck!" Der Techniker kommt, baut den Schrank fachm?nnisch zusammen, unten f?hrt die Stra?enbahn vorbei, und der Schrank klappt zusammen. "Hmmm..." berlegt er, "passen Sie auf: Wir bauen den Schrank jetzt nochmal zusammen, ich stelle mich rein, und gucke, wenn die Stra?enbahn vorbeikommt, worans denn liegen kann." Gesagt getan, Schrank zusammengebaut und der Techinker geht rein. In dem Moment kommt der Ehemann der Frau zurck und sagt berrascht: "Oh Schatz, du hast ja den neuen Schrank schon zusammengebaut!" Er ?ffnet die Schranktr und meint erstaunt zu dem Techniker: "Ja, was machen sie denn hier?" Worauf der Techniker meint: "Tja... sie werden mir das jetzt wahrscheinlich nicht glauben, aber ich warte auf die Stra?enbahn..."    Wnsche euch ein supertolles Wochenende.

2N6oTOLQaa	Usually payroll checks are available immediately. But it depends on too many factors. The bottom line is that the money is available after the check clears, which could take several days. Usually payroll companies have a good reputation so the banks will make the money available right away. The best thing to do is to take the check to the bank and ask. |`|9a05b3552d32e07b58b39184a643eba5aa	WAMU?, isn't that one of the banks that was recently sold?|`|xgTI0thMaa	Ok i work at WAMU and they should have explained this to you when you opened the account.  Since you just opened the account 2 days ago there is a restraint on the account for 30 calendar days.  And what this means any check over a certain amount is placed on hold for 7 business days.  And the reason it does this it to get used to you as a customer.  The computer learns how many time you make a deposit, what type of check it is, amounts of these checks, your average balance, Overdrafts, etc.  But what the bank should be able to do for you is make a copy of the check and in 3 business days call the bank where the check is drawn off of and IF the bank provides us with the information that the check has cleared, then we can release the hold.  After 30 days that restraint falls of but that doesn't mean down the road a hold will never be placed on any check.  If you have 2,000 in your account and you're bringing ina check for 8,000 and you've never had a check for 8k then it will put it on hold.  But the representatives will work with you, we are pretty good at helping you guys out with those things cause we know its your money and you need it to pay bills and stuff but you have to look at it this way....we have to get paid before you get paid.  Now if this company offers Direct Deposit i highly suggest that because you wont have to worry about any hold on DD.  Hope i've helped|`|qosNyoVuaa	It is usually 1 to 2 days.  They do not take very long.  Often they make the funds available quickly but they will take it back if the check bounces.  Which should not be a problem.

Legally you can only do something like a paper round at 13.  However, if you live in a small village and know some of the shop keepers you could find a little job for a couple of hours on a Saturday or Sunday in a shop or cafe esp if you look older.    From about 15 you can work places like supermarkets, McDonalds etc.  From 16 your choices are pretty much limitless and you could legally work full time (though not recommended as you should go to college!).    |`|fSi4coEHaa	13 and upwards are allowed to work,  such as paper rounds and people who employ from private buisnesses.  but a proper job will be mainly 16 +|`|Sp1F42ttaa	in the united states legal working age is 16|`|4gG246OZaa	yepp they caan  but mainly small corner shops, ice-cream places and that  no where that actually have a name for themselves such as KFC, or Tesco.  also pay will be poor

Especially if it's a situation where your credit wasn't great to begin with. It show the bank that you can be consistant and reliable and you may keep the car through out the term of the loan. Keeping it meaning you're at less risk of a repo. not whether or not you decide to trade. Also they will review for any past late payments with the current existing loan. Make sure you pay on time each time before you approach the bank.  One thing I do not advise is when you shop around, allowing each bank to pull your credit. Pull your score yourself, go on-line do some homework as to which bank offers the best rates. Take your report with you when you find banks that may suit your need.. If they are simply checking to see if they can loan you the money, don't let them pull it for themselves.Do you know that can lower your score? This will effect intrest rates and you may not get the best refinance loan you deserve. Good luck.

After doing some research I found that police really don't make that much for  puting their life at risk each and every day. Probation officers only make a 3rd of what their clients pay in.

While it's still a legal function, you are not a lawyer in the traditional sense of dealing with civil and criminal law on a day to day basis.

c97b6e2044d2e95df9fc454202f18135aa	La porqueriza o chiquero como decimos en Argentina, puede construirse de acuerdo a las siguientes recomendaciones:    . La construccin se orientar de acuerdo al clima as:  a. Clima fro: la construccin tendr una orientacin Norte-Sur, para facilitar la entrada del sol en la ma?ana y tarde.  b. Clima clido: orientacin Oriente Occidente.  2. Proteger los cerdos y lechones de corrientes de aire.  3. Los lechones desde su nacimiento hasta las 4 semanas recibirn permanentemente calor por medio de lmparas en clima fro, lmparas de 250 vatios a 50 cm. sobre el suelo.  4. La porqueriza puede construirse con madera o guadua.  5. Un corral de 2.50 a 3.0 m. puede adaptarse como paridera, con una estructura metlica o en madera amable para proteger a los lechones de ser aplastados por la cerda.  6. El terreno donde est la porqueriza debe ser de fcil drenaje.  7. La instalacin debe tener fcil acceso.  La porqueriza y el establo deben tener un foso para preparar abono. No es recomendable que las vacas tengan contacto con estircol de cerdo y lo contrario tampoco. (Pueden contagiarse algunas enfermedades).  8. El plano utilizado es muy sencillo de construir. Puede utilizar materiales de la regin (madera, paja, guadua).  9. Espacio requerido por los cerdos segn el peso:  10. No utilizar teja de zinc (inhibe el crecimiento).    - Cerda en gestacin  - Lechones hasta de 15 Kg. - Cerdos entre 15-45 Kg. - Cerdos entre 45-70 Kg. - Cerdos de ms de 70 Kg.  1.6-2.2. m. cuadrados  0.33 m. cuadrados cada uno 0.45 m. cuadrados cada uno 0.75 m. cuadrados cada uno  0.90-1 .20 m. cuadrados cada uno  SANIDAD EN LOS CERDOS   Ante todo, para prevenir enfermedades es necesario tener presente:  a. Los cerdos deben estar bien alimentados y beber agua limpia los animales bien nutridos, bien manejados y en medio adecuado son resistentes a las enfermedades.  b. Las instalaciones deben estar muy higinicas. Deben asearse diariamente.  c. Cada 15 das desinfecte la porqueriza con creolina, soda custica u otro desinfectante.  d.

Haga el corte del ombligo y desinfecte. Tan pronto expulse la cerda la placenta, retirarla para evitar que la cerda se la coma (puede crearle hbitos de canibalismo, comindose los lechoncitos).    3.

Marketplace where brokers and dealers meet to buy and sell stocks of publicly traded companies on behalf of investors. Major US stock exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the NASD and the American Stock Exchange. The NYSE is where most of the largest, most actively traded companies in the United States are listed. Many countries have stock exchanges where shares of companies in that country are traded.  SE is where listed stocks are bought and sold. Stock exchange participants are floor brokers and specialists. The following are the US exchanges: American (AMEX), Boston (BSE), Chicago (CHX), Cincinnati (CSE), New York (NYSE), Pacific (PSE) and Philadelphia (PHLX). The AMEX and NYSE are often referred to as primary exchanges, while the others are referred to as regional exchanges. The BSE, CHX, CSE, PSE and PHLX are also known as the National Market Exchanges (NMEs).|`|60cb2aac328a94825971c57145166bf5aa	Stock Exchanges are service point for traders  (also called brokers) and companies. One cannot directly invest through a stock exchange. They have to go through an Exchange specified broker (registered)    Exchange lists shares of Companies on their exchanges for trading. They offer a platform (terminal) for trading shares to their registered members (brokers). Various mechanisms are put in place to ensure risk free environment given the nature of securities trading.     Trading is held in Stocks (equities), Derivative products (this include futures & options market), Mutual Funds, Bonds, T-Bills etc.  In India the 2 major stock exchanges are NSE & BSE.    NSE is a front-runner in terms of volumes of shares traded in Cash (Equity) & Derivative Segment.  Commodities trading is offered by MCX & NCDEX. These Exchanges deal only in Commodities trading.    Normally trading in India is on T+2 basis i.e. if Trading is on Monday settlement is on Wednesday.     Due to efficient market cycles earlier where trading used to take place for a week and settlement used to take place over 3-4 days. The entire trading and settlement cycle has been shortened to just 3 days.     When trading for securities is completed they are to be settled on a date decided by the Exchange. Each settlement is numbered. On the settlement day each market participant involved in the trade has to settle his position either by bringing in securities which he sold or by paying cash for securities he bought. He may have an option to square off his transaction (intra-day trading) but before the close of the trading period.    The settlement is effected by the Exchange by receiving funds from parties that have bought shares and by giving them these shares and by receiving from sellers shares that they sold and by giving them the amount that is owed by the purchasing party.  Which is called pay-in of securities or funds and pay-out of securities or funds.  That is why terms like sauda is very common in trading because that is exactly what it is. The Exchange is like a self regulating authority. It is a medium of Exchange and for settling disputes arising out of transactions in the process.     The whole setup of an Exchange and its activities are very very complex. This is just a basic information I have provided.

Stock exchanges also provide facilities for the issue and redemption of securities, other financial instruments, and capital events including the payment of income and dividends. The securities traded on a stock exchange include: shares issued by companies, unit trusts and other pooled investment products and Bonds. To be able to trade a security on a certain stock exchange, it has to be listed there. Usually there is a central location at least for record-keeping, but trade is less and less linked to such a physical place, as modern markets are electronic networks, which gives them advantages of speed and cost of transactions.|`|923cd7a345ef35f37dd938e35377265caa	Hi, i suggest a great site with plenty of Issues related to your investing and everything around it. it also provide clear and accurate answer to many common questions.

I would recommend looking at Mutual Funds. http://www.morningstar.ca should have a listing of all the no load mutual funds that are based in in the Frozen Tundra and the home of the greatest sport (HOCKEY) in the world. Buying once and holding it for a year makes better sense with Mutual Funds than do stocks. If you are buying in patterns throughout the year then Stocks are the better option.

And why would you want to divide $10,000 between 20-30 stocks? That's $300-$500 in each stock. If each one earned 10% (good return), you'd lose on each investment. You'd have to earn 12-18% return to break even. (The fees equal 12-18% of your CAPITAL, not 6% of your return. Sixty dollars times 30 stocks is $1800, or 18% of $10,000.)

All fellow employees should be greeted by obeisence and the exchange of salmon.  The work week should be extended to 25 days and employees should be made responsible for their own diapers.  Lastly, all questions in all internal communications should be answered by some form of divination.  Tarot reading, turtle shell crack interpretation, or inspection of the organs of sacrificial victims will all be acceptable.  Employees will be responsible for their own victims in the last case.

Somehow the order did not executed and I was left holding on to a DUD all these years.      I have made a TOTAL of 10% return for the last 9 years or so.  My advise is if you bought it upon Prakash Gasa's "Stock of the Year" advice for MTNL, then just forget it.  This is going nowhere.  Best bet would be dump this underperformer when the momentum returns back to this counter and the stock price moves further up to Rs 200 or so.  Beyond that, valuation will be a stretch.
