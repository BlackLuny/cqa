I was able to catch an Anime cartoon that I liked every now and then back when I was in high school in the 90's. The theme was that there was a person(or people) who got inside heavy armor (not robots) and used swords to fight this arch nemesis that would attack their planet from time to time. I don't think the planet was earth, but it was earth like. The main character was a young man with black "bushy" hair that draped over his ears, and his armor was red and white. The sword fights usually took place in space, and the fighting was high tech as well. As in, their swords had special abilities. The swords were big also.

It will be the first time I've ventured into a mosh-pit scenario, so I'm just trying to get as much information as possible as to what's expected. I'm about to turn 17 and female.      I've done some research online and learned about mosh pit etiquette & rules, but I'm still confused about what I should wear. The sites I've visited say "comfortable, light & tight-fitting clothing". Although I understand that in principle, I'm looking for more specific information. Should I wear shorts? 3/4 length leggings? I don't want to wear skinny jeans because I think they'll make me too hot, they're too restricive & I don't have a pair I'm willing to ruin. As far as tops go, am I better to wear a T-shirt or a tank top? I originally thought tank top but I'm a bit worried about the whole modesty thing. I don't want some overzealous mosher to cop a feel.      Also, is it worth investing in a pair of converses for moshing? Or are runners more suited?      As you can see I'm very new at this, so any suggestions you guys have would be greatly appreciated   Thanks in advance   Jeska

20090220175517AAJDzPr	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Would you rather sleep in your car or in a windowless guest house without a bathroom?	Lets say that your parents tell you if you come home late even on weekends you must sleep in your car. They will allow you to put a cott in a windowless guest house that has no restroom inside the guest house.       The oneroom guest house would be heated and would keep out wind and rain.      What would you choose?      Lets say you couldn't afford a hotel?         Your car has a back seat that is very comfortable.      The oneroom guest house has a solid door with a lock.         The cott in the guest house would actually be a single mattress.      Since you would use the guest house your mother would allow you to decorate and paint the inside of the guest house.      For example your mom would allow you to paint the inside of the door and the walls.       Unfortunatley you wouldn't be able to put windows inside.         Would you be afraid to close the door while you would be inside the one room windowless guest house?

I'm a bit confused about the wild card concept of American Idol, though I do know the brief contest.

20090220184829AAxO7aT	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	What was the last album you listened to that really loved, and what was the last one that you really hated?	For the first time, I mean. Relistening doesn't count. And I mean listened to in full, so no bashing bands that you've never taken the time to sit down and listen to a full album by.      For me, the last one I loved was Midnight Marauders by A Tribe Called Quest (far better than The Low End Theory, and I love The Low End Theory), and the last one I hated was Dog Man Star by Suede. There was no redeeming quality to note. It was unadulterated pretentious sap.      BQ: Britpop or NWOBHM?

20090220185606AAniO3R	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Are Water & Earth Signs Considered To Be "Unsocial", Where As Fire & Air Aren't?	Because i've read that Fire and Air signs are considered to be "positive" signs. And Positive signs are very social people, they have a need to be around people and having a large group of friends.      Where as Earth and Water signs are considered "Negative" signs. And they don't care as much to be around people, even though i'm sure they have friends. They are not willing to spend a large amount of time into them..      Well i was wondering if this is true, because i do have a lot of Earth and Water friends that are "not" very social.  But then i have some that are VERY social.      So idkno im just curious to know if this is true =]

20090220185811AAEqIjS	Entertainment & Music;Television;Comedy	Help!!! I'm in love with a fictional character( Pam Beesley).?	For years now i've been a huge admirer of the NBC hit tv show "The Office". I started watching while on my first deployment to the middle east and I still proclaim it as my favorite TV show to watch. I have always saw myself in Jim. I mean the way I act, the lax attitude towards life and living, the shyness in saying certain things and even the fears that we both have are mirror images of each other. Heck i've even had the same hair type as him even before I started watching the show. Granted military hair doesn't leave you with much but I promise you my hair is at maximum length for military standards and is always messed up. And naturally with living vicariously through Jim I have honestly fallen in love with Pam. I just don't get it. I search all my life to find my dream girl and I turn on the TV and there she is. It's not Jenna Fischer that i'm drawn to (even though I will say without the same attitude she still sparks my interest). It's Pam! The way she walks, the sound of her sweet soft voice. The words that she speaks seem to hug your body making you feel so warm and comfortable, resonating in your head for hours on end to the point where you can't work for a single second without thinking of her.  I swear every time that show starts and I see her in her little cardigans I can feel my heart pounding harder and harder. Her skin seems just the right tone of paleness and her beautiful seemingly soft brunette hair (with a little bit of strawberry mixed in there) just floating off her shoulders.  I just don't get it. I searched continents to discover the right girl only to see her on TV as a fictional character that I can never have nor be with. It's sounds so stupid and childish but I honestly feel heartbroken. This is just rediculous. I'm rediculous.

I think his name was dwayne or daron I think it had a v and and w in the name. like two initials then his last name. I think he wears glasses and is pretty much bald. Please help me in this one in a million chance of a question.

20090220222257AAAsWxi	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Fans of Robert Pattinson only?	I'm a huge fan of Robert. I search the internet daily (tmz,Perez Hilton,etc) for news and quotes from him and theres a pattern that I'm starting to see that is worrying me. He appears to be very upset that he can't play his music anymore because someone always records it and puts it on you-tube. He says he doesn't want to be on the new moon soundtrack. He seems upset because he can't go anywhere without being mobbed or followed by papz. He doesn't like fans being obsessed with his hair, clothes, personal life, etc. Is it just me or does it seem that he really HATES being famous? I'm afraid that he's either going to say forget it and quit or he is going to become one of those people who have such a hard time dealing with his success that he resorts to taking drugs to deal with it.

20090220204036AAgBwZG	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What is the name of this movie??? Please help!?	I remember watching a movie about a high school that gets taken over by terrorists (or bad guys in masks with guns) and they hold a whole class hostage, (I think the rest of the school escapes or wasn't there in the first place, and it might have been the drama club that gets held).....anyway, some of the kids escape but are trapped in the school running around being chased by the bad guys.       the point of the movie is that the kids fight back against the bad guys and in the end the whole high school explodes. I'm pretty sure the title has the word "High" in it, but I can't find it anywhere. I remember having it on VHS in like 2000-2003 (I think), so I know it was before then. Probably early-mid 90's.       Please help me find this!!!!

You wander for 3 days only to find yourself deeper in the hills and even more lost than you were before.  At the end of the 3rd day you find yourself a cave in which to spend the night.  Due to water deprivation, you have been hallucinating rather vividly.  So far you've seen a large bottle of Aquifina, a talking pineapple, and Barack Obama dancing with a giant chicken.  While you're in the cave you see the most bizarre and terrifying creature you've ever laid eyes on.  Assuming it's a hallucination, you are somewhat amused at what your brain can produce.  But it's not a hallucination, it's the rare and evil Peruvian Cat Monkey, about to devour you.  What does it look like?

I mean when there are others around us he speaks in a normal voice. But today we were alone and he was talking to me in a low voice, and I without even willing it start talking in the same way. After such talk there is a very strange feeling left, cause generally we talk about work.   I think why does he talk only with me in a low voice? Is it normal?

I don't remember a ton of details about it, but I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction.  I have asked many people my age about this, but no one seems to remember it.      I was young when the show was on, so I put the airing date from early to mid 1980's.  The show took place in space.  Humans flew jets that turned into robots.  Not human looking robots, but robots that looked more like super fighting body armor.  The shows that I have eliminated are Transformers, Go-Bots, Voltron, and Vehicle Voltron.        Please help before this drives me crazy.

You wander for 3 days only to find yourself deeper in the hills and even more lost than you were before. At the end of the 3rd day you find yourself a cave in which to spend the night. Due to water deprivation, you have been hallucinating rather vividly. So far you've seen a large bottle of Aquifina, a talking pineapple, and Barack Obama dancing with a giant chicken. While you're in the cave you see the most bizarre and terrifying creature you've ever laid eyes on. Assuming it's a hallucination, you are somewhat amused at what your brain can produce. But it's not a hallucination, it's the rare and evil Peruvian Cat Monkey, about to devour you. What does it look like?

My computer is working fine, but this seems to be a problem.      *My friend told me never to watch vids on YouTube using wi-fi, so I didn't use YouTube. Does it also go for other video sites? (Although I also did use YouTube on Wi-Fi that time yet it still works just fine.       HELP?

20090221013920AA00Cxa	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Bands with amazing stage presence/stage performance?	What're some bands you've seen live that have amazing stage presence/stage performance?   Like, in my opinion the tour TOOL did back in 07 I wanna say?    Or 06, I can't remember,    But Maynards stage presence SUCKED.    The lights and video screens and all that was INCREDIBLE, but he just sang the songs, barely said anything, and got off stage.    No crowd interaction or anything.      Bands that have had good stage presence when I saw them would have to be:   Vomit Gun   Blank Image   Breathe Carolina   Winds of Plague   A Day To Remember   Senses Fail   The A.K.A's   Pierce The Veil   Vomit Gun (I know, 2nd time, but they are my bro's, and their shows are hilarious (: )   Aiden (still a fan of them, but not as much as I was)   30 Seconds to Mars (won't be the same without Leto)   Nine Inch Nails   And the best stage performance I've ever seen has to be   Foxy Shazam         Just bands that do crazy stuff, and interact with the audience; bands that joke around on stage for the hell of it and don't take it too seriously.      ALSO! Please suggest bands that aren't really popular/big (I.E. My Chemical Romance, because I hate the idea of their music but I still enjoy it hahaha)   It can be local bands from your area, or bands that are starting to get popular, but just not massive bands.   I say that because I'm more into shows than concerts, because it's much more personal, and you can see the band on a different level.         Thanks ! (:

20090219120731AAISPLm	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What kind of handgun is the character 'Rogue' using in the movie 'War'?	In the movie 'War' (starring Jet Li and Jason Statham) the character 'Rogue' (Jet Li) uses a particular kind of handgun that I've never seen before. The ammuniton looks more like a rifle round rather than a handgun round. The casing is tapered and the bullet is pointed like a rifle round. I believe that in the movie it was described as some sort of Asian gun and ammo, but I didn't really catch the name.

20090219141024AABN4Gh	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Poll :- Yes or No?. Can you see my Angel?	Do angels reveal themselves to you. I don’t see them by looking. They may show themselves to me. They are very beautiful. Sometimes when I close my eyes I see the celestial world. It is very populated. It is too much for my mind to come to terms with. It is like a rock concert in Light.      I can show you your angel, but you may not know what you are looking at, or you may resist seeing them. e.g. blind persons disease. When a person is unable to comprehend what they are seeing, the energy that would go to their eyes to see, remains behind them at a special point on the back that I call the ‘blind person’s point’. By activating this point you can bring the information back into consciousness, and it can be accepted and understood. Some visual weaknesses can be released this way.
20090219141336AAcGBFR	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Poll :- Why don’t people see angels?	What they are looking for does not exist. What is there they don’t know how to see, and their hearts are afraid to open to feel what may come if the angel were to appear.      Angels are not how you think. What you think it would be like is a fantasy. It is not easy to be ready for such feelings. Nor do we have the time.      When I was a teenager, the room would begin filling up with light. It interrupted my concentration when I was trying to study. Thirty years later, I realized it had been the angel bringing me my angel gifts. I had never even considered angels let alone been prepared. And dreams did not mean anything to me. I wish I’d known then what I know now.   Do You Believe in Angels?

He wants attention.         i think dogs don't naturly hate cats theres no reason for it and there must be a reason for their behaviour

I apologized to her and explained it was a dare, and I said to please not beat me up.

I started smoking about a week and a half ago just to lose weight, and it worked I lost my cravings for food, and i lost 7lbs, and food does not have the same taste.

The background is them in a bowl (yup, the bowl I wore on my head out of stupid today-- and finally got to take home from art being that it was a clay project:P).

Yoda, my green water balloon died, actually I threw him at a wooden fence.      My questions are:   1. Do you think me throwing Yoda at a wooden fence and killing him is abusive?      2. Don't my children look like me?!      3. How do I make Barney stop crying and Eraser Man stop beating her up?       4. Anything else like comments on my children?      R.I.P.

20090219163211AAo1xi2	Entertainment & Music;Music;Singing	I don't know what to do! help!?	Ok, so here's the deal. I love to sing and musicals and everything. But every year at my school, the same people get roles over and over and over. And when I get called back I don't get anyhting cause the same people get everything. I work as hard as I can to show my director that I'm just as good and should get a chance! But he still gives them all to them. I want to try and improve my range, my belting is ok, my high soprano is ok, but my mezzo sucks. Any ideas on how I can improve those? I don't have alot of money so I can't really go get the best lessnos out there. Plus anyother ideas on how I can show him I'm just as good? I'm sick of being counted out.
20090219163422AAdJyy8	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	Good asian romantic comedy dramas to watch?	I have already watched:   [taiwanese]   -Brown Sugar Macchiato   -Romantic Princess   -The Legend of Brown Sugar Chivalries   -Miss No Good   -Fated To Love You   -It Started With A Kiss 1 & 2   (trying out Boys Before Flowers, currently stopped. Doesn't seem that interesting)      [korean]   -Princess Hours   -The 1st Shop of Coffee Prince   -Couple Or Trouble      I'm not really into actors that aren't really good looking.   Not judging the drama by looks, but it doesn't seem interesting.   I like to watch light hearted funny romantic dramas with good/okay looking actors and actresses.   If there's any that is really similar to Brown Sugar Macchiato or Romantic Princess, please tell me :D      If you have time, please summarize it for me and, or put the genre of each drama.   Thank you soo much.   Thanks in advance. ^^      by the way, has anyone watched love or bread?   everyone says its really interesting and im planning on watching.
20090219163438AAS9QlG	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	I need a good song for a bass and an electric guitar?	A friend and I were looking to get together and jam but can't seem to find a good song to do together. I have just a regular four string electric bass and he has an electric guitar. We both kinda suck too, so the easier the better. We're both more into the older stuff, like Queen and Kiss and are big fans of the band 54-40 (look them up, it's worth it). We only do have the bass and the guitar though, so song choices are kind of limited. Any suggestions would be appreciated!

20090219165358AADpmYK	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	On LOST, about why Ben's beat up?	My theory about last night's episode on why Ben is all bloody is this: he said to Widmore he was going to kill Penny and that was what he was off trying to do. He saw Desmond at the church which mean he also knew that Penny was in LA, and later that night he left saying he needed to tie off a loose end. Also, when he called Jack in the morning he was at the docks where possibly Desmond's boat was. So, maybe it was Desmond or one of Widmore's men who beat him up so badly. What do you think?
