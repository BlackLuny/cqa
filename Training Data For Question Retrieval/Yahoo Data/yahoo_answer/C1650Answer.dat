Many countries do not require any vaccinations.  This site always recommends Hepatitis B for everyone for every country, but it is a recommendation, not a requirement.  For some countries, other vaccinations are also recommended , but not required.  There are actually only a few countries that have REQUIRED  vaccinations.|`|z29H9uJSaa	Well people here in Michigan would say to me "It's the law, you have to get your kid's vaccinated or they can't go to school". Shame on them because they also knew there was a waiver available for us to sign which we did and our kids go to school without vaccnations. I have 5 kids, all are healthy, not one of my kids have ever even had an ear infection and I knew I would never loose them to s.i.d.s. What a joke s.i.d.s. Yea your baby is just all of a sudden going to die for NO REASON. Sorry as you can propably tell I get a little upset about this subject. Good luck to you.

tfvbgSDjaa	Having lived in Riyadh for 8 years both single and married. I would only recommend moving to a compound. Once your there you will be able to see the huge difference a compound has over an apartment or house. People at your work site may be able to help and give some suggestions on compounds. I lived at Fal compound, Cedar village compound and a few others. I had the chance to visit many others while I was there. You will most likely need a vehicle as well, for easy transport and freedom. My advice would be to take a defensive driving course as the rules of the road tend to be a bit different their, and I was one the few who traveled 100,000 miles accident free.<br>  As for the housing arrangements most companies provide a certain $ amount per year for housing and the compounds often have various sizes of apartments or even houses. 1 bedroom apartment on a large compound will start at about $10,000 or more. I've been back for 3 years now. When I left I had a 3 bedroom house I paid around $20,000/year for. <br>  The compounds will have more security and also more benefits, like pools and restaurants and so on.|`|AA12350023	erm.. I dont know what country you are from.. but if you are from the US.. we dont just rent out houses like they do in America... Houses are hard to find to lease.. and mostly Realtors rent to families, not singles... unless the house is rented or owned by a contractor and he is housing several single men together for his job site..you are more likely to find an apartment or a flat in a compound to lease... |`|AA10248239	Your employer should help you with housing, either by providing it or by paying you a living allowance.  They will have some kind of accommodation ready for you when you arrive.<br>  <br>  Check with them.<br>  <br>  Most people in Saudi cities live in apartments, but some in villas (individual homes), especially in compounds.  It's unusual for a single to live alone in a villa, though.|`|22870b9fa74667f35d8c85caa8621251aa	Well it is EASY to get flat or villa rented. Me and my husband just moved from UAE to Saudi Arabia- Riyadh and got an excellent 3 bedroom flat in nice area. There are many newly constructed houses around which are available for rent. Plus there are such type of accomodation as compounds which are a bit more expansive than usual flat to rent. But it is possible to rent in compound 2.<br>  Area nearby Al Faisaliah Center , The Ministry of Interior, Olaya street, Murabba area are FULL of  buildings for rent!|`|uidg8Uh0aa	ask your company to provide you with a list of places or companies to contact to rent. <br>  small house, like a townhouse will be available to you via compounds (outside the city) where all expats live, you can also find villas for rent downtown, but have your company rent it for you, it will be easier and faster done. <br>  once you hit town buy a small booklet called riyadh today where you will have a list of all residential complexes avaialble.

Je l'ai deja pris 4 fois cette année. <br>  C'est bien mieux d'etre sous sol que d'etre suspendu dans le ciel avec seulement l'air comme support.<br>  <br>  C'est beacoup plus cool que l'avion. Tu t'installes dans le train avec un bouquin ou un baladeur et voila. La traversee du tunnel ne prend  que 20 minutes car on est deja en vitesse. (La navette de voitures en prend 40, car il faut le temps pour demarrer). <br>  <br>  Le seul hic, c'est qu'il se prend pour un avion.

Ce qui me laisse un peu plus d'autorité pour en parler que Mlle sigfried, qui se prétend historienne et qui n'en rate pas une ! Mubarak, un brillant diplomate ! J'aurais vraiment tout lu sur ce site, histoire de m'amuser un peu j'aimerais qu'elle explique en quoi Mubarak est un bon diplomate.<br>  Pour être sérieux, il y a longtemps que les gens disent que Gamal va prendre la suite de son père. Ce n'est donc pas une nouveauté. Tu veux manifester ? Toute personne connaissant un minimum l'égypte s'est bien que le système répressif il est particulièrement développé, un ami originaire du delta avait participé à l'époque où il entrait à l'université, à une manifestation de contestation plut?t légère. Il a eu droit à une visite gratuite d'une salle de torture dans un commissariat. Juste une visite, c'était un étudiant tranquille d'une bonne famille qui a fait la révolution, mais il a compris le message : il est en France depuis une dizaine d'années, c'est quand même plus tranquille. C'est un ami, ce qui n'empêche pas que j'ai une très profonde admiration pour ceux qui choisissent la voie de la lutte. Abdel Karim Soule?mane, un jeune blogueur de 22 ans, avait affirmé sur son blog que l’université Al Azhar, autorité de la communauté sunnite au Caire, diffusait des idées extrémistes et avait comparé Moubarak à un pharaon. Il a écopé le 12 mars 2007 de trois ans de prison pour atteinte à la religion et à un an de plus pour offense au Président Moubarak. N'importe qui peut voir que l'égypte est en train de basculer dans un conservatisme ou Mubarak et les Frères ne sont plus ennemis mais alliés. Dans ce contexte, contester l'emprise du clan Moubarak ou de la religion sur la société représente un risque. Certains ont encore le courage de le prendre.|`|o6x2QXFRaa	Moubarak c’est un bon diplomate dans une zone difficile et dans une  période bouleversante .

By that I mean, why does the US do this when they know that it will just ruin what should be an otherwise good relationship?

Des négociations ont été officiellement ouvertes entre le gouvernement fran?ais et le Gouvernement Provisoire de la République Algérienne le 20 mai 1961. Il est hors de doute pour les participants que les négociations aboutiront à l’institution d’un état algérien indépendant : les discussions portent sur les conditions exactes de l’indépendance. Et pourtant c’est à partir de l’été 1961 qu’eurent lieu les plus terribles violences que connut le territoire métropolitain pendant la Guerre d’Algérie. C’est cette contradiction que met en évidence l’examen des faits qui ont conduit aux massacres du 17 octobre 1961.<br>  En 1961, Maurice Papon est préfet de police de Paris. Nommé à ce poste en 1958 sous la IVème République, il y a été maintenu par le président Charles de Gaulle sous la Vème. Lorsqu’en 1958 M. Papon est nommé préfet, à la suite de violentes manifestations de policiers parisiens, sa recommandation est " l’efficacité " dont il a fait preuve lors de son mandat de préfet à Constantine. De 1956 à 1958, en tant que préfet et IGAME pour les départements de l’Est algérien, il a instauré un système de répression dans lequel la torture est systématique, les exécutions sommaires courantes. Lorsqu’il est nommé préfet de police à Paris en 1958, <br>  Au matin du mardi 17 octobre, la police sait qu’une manifestation de masse se prépare ; des cars de police quadrillent la ville, des policiers cernent les bouches de métro aux portes de Paris, prêts à arrêter les manifestants. Aux portes de Paris, à la sortie des métros étoile, Opéra, dans les couloirs de la station Concorde, sur les Grands Boulevards, les manifestants seront systématiquement matraqués, à coups de crosse, de gourdin, de baton, souvent jusqu’à ce qu’ils s’effondrent. Les policiers frappent au visage, au ventre, des manifestants qui ne font montre à aucun moment d’aucune violence ni d’aucune résistance. Sur le boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle, au pont de Neuilly, au Pont-Neuf d’Argenteuil et en d’autres lieux, les policiers tirent sur les manifestants. Sur les ponts aux portes de Paris et sur le pont Saint-Michel, des hommes sont précipités à la Seine. En plein Paris et pendant plusieurs heures se déroule une véritable chasse au faciès, à laquelle la population parisienne assiste et collabore même parfois. Le préfet de police M. Papon suit toutes les opérations et se rend lui-même à l’Etoile, pour constater leur " bon déroulement ". Il a aussi connaissance de toutes les liaisons radio de la police. Il sait donc que de faux messages d’information circulent selon lesquels des policiers auraient été tués. Il ne les démentira pas.<br>  Plus de dix mille Algériens sont interpellés. Ils sont internés au palais des Sports, au Parc des Expositions, au stade de Coubertin, au Centre d’Identification de Vincennes, pendant près de quatre jours. Quatre jours pendant lesquels les violences continuent. A leur arrivée, les manifestants sont systématiquement battus. Dans l’enceinte des lieux d’internement, on assiste à des exécutions et nombreux sont ceux qui meurent de blessures non soignées. Au lendemain de la manifestation. Malgré les efforts de quelques parlementaires, le gouvernement empêche la création d’une commission d’enquête. Aucune des plaintes déposées n’aboutira.|`|xRaGyugTaa	le 17 octobre 1961 lorsque des dizaines d'algériens manifestent pacifiquement contre le couvre feu qui leur avait été imposé par le préfet de police  Maurice Papon     ont été arrêté , emprisonner  , torturer et nombre d'entre eux refouler par la police en algérie |`|ac6a3335a3826be1e80b38895213985baa	C'est la journée de mon anniverssaire.<br>  <br>  Il y a deux manifestations :<br>  Celle de l'immigration ou le fameux 17 octobre 1961, des algériens ont été torturés et jeté dans la Seine.<br>  Celle de la révolution Russe. |`|701eff326853ad94962b8b79b333353daa	Sous le Préfet Maurice Papon, une manifestation Pacifique en faveur de l'indépendance de l'Algérie, 325 manifestants masacrés sont morts sous les coups de la police, où jeté à la Seine, d'autre sont morts en rétention laissé 4 jours enfermés.

rVUvopaLaa	that's the way things work in the Phils recognitions such as this are only given when they are gone.  <br>  <br>  it's a good observation, what's the point? <br>  <br>  they name streets, important buildings the like airport, places, erect statues etc etc  in honour of a dead person to recognise his/her contributions and achievements ironically not exactly to please the person.  <br>  <br>  there's this seemingly funny practice also when a corrupt and useless government official dies the eulogy services sounded like a hero.  yeah right big time!<br>  <br>  but in the country i'm in the noble or heroic contributions are truly recognised right away and if they deserve to be name after streets, buildings or erect a statues they do it also whilst the person is still alive. <br>  <br>  for reasons that the heroic person will be motivated to do more good deeds while still alive and continue to live as a model to all. as a result  the general public will be inspired too and hopefully will do the same.  <br>  <br>  it is best that it should be now the practice in the Phils to inspire more people to do good deeds and hopefully emulate others too. <br>  <br>  g'day|`|pm2EeEgiaa	The government wants to look good - when GMA realized that there are indeed lots of fans of Francis M.

AA11937736	I've enver stayed there but I notice it has generally good reviews on Tripadvisor. It ought to be pretty good given that I notice the cheapest low season double room costs 180 euros.
KYZF9SO9aa	Depends where you buy it,in a shop or in a pub.<br>  Even in shops price can vary.<br>  on average around 15€|`|c0b3df9e6b5632ff0bda2a96cf938465aa	Regular sales price should be around 13..14 euro in liquor stores, a "little" bit more in clubs, and I've seen it for as little as 9.8€.

KYZF9SO9aa	They do more and more since the fines are rising for the pubs who sell to underage|`|c0b3df9e6b5632ff0bda2a96cf938465aa	The law enforces every staff in bars, pubs, supermarkets to id-check you if you don't look old enough or are not personally known. Like everywhere, it's not so much a matter of the law, but a matter of how friendly you are. There is a supermarket in my rural area where they make fun of id-carding young tourists who want to carry out crates of beer and some liquor, and they're regularly threatened by youngsters with negative id check with promises like "we'll come back, and then...!!!"<br>  <br>  No one ever returned, because the locals showed them better places to go. Where you won't be checked, for instance, or can be introduced by a friend. -- And on occasion, it even happend that a local with id picked up the beer crate.<br>  <br>  What I want to say is this: Young people all around the world, unite! If the government don't give you drinks, ask a friend!<br>  <br>  ---<br>  > I was even asked once when I was like 24 already,<br>  <br>  @PiPi, makes me laugh right now! I once had a girlfriend who was only 1,57 m tall, and they always, really ALWAYS asked for her ID. One doorkeeper asked so aggressively that she threw her ID card and her drivers license on the table, and I could hardly keep her from slapping his face with her car keys. I feared for my life, as that guy was 1,90 meters tall, or so I guessed.<br>  <br>  We had drinks for free then.|`|EzxeHsLHaa	Well, it really depends on where you go actually. Some supermarkets just don't care. I have seen 16 year old friends walking out the door with 2 bottles of vodka before.<br>  But in bars and discos it's a bit different, here they usually check, because police is more likely to drop by there and they don't want to be responsible for kids drinking themselves into a coma.<br>  Still happens though.|`|Qmnae2qzaa	The laws are more and more enforced since the fines to people selling alcohol to minors are getting higher in both bars and pubs and also in supermarkets.<br>  This is caused by the binge drinking culture which has developed in recent years.|`|iCGhHFlYaa	Germany is well known to enforce all laws etc.
jTmMzolAaa	Sure! Go to www.kupika.com it's a great website. And when you make an account there's this link at the website toolbar and it says 'Conditional match' click it and fill in the details of a pen pal you want. Age, sex, location, interests anything. Also, on this website you get to send messages, letters, draw, write q & a's to each other, get your own personal profile, personal advertising on the homepage, post twits/status and more. :) Oooh, did I mention you also get to keep an online diary??? :)|`|GvgmSxdCaa	Contact your high school and ask them to put you in touch with safe and reputable pen-pal services...|`|v5XYluuFaa	Don't know. Try interpals. I used to go on that site a few years back. (google it). I'd like one too, lol, let me know if you get one!|`|a1zhTrHOaa	That is super easy to do, you can go to you high school counselor and ask about talking to a person in another country, they will normally ask you if you have a preference.  Another way is to go online and look at one of the schools in England and send an email to them asking if they would find you a pen pal.

I always watch for it, but I heard they may get rid of it and they're going to update the sky, I hope it's not true!<br>  <br>  As for what I want changed, I would like to see the track fixed because it's old and unsafe. I also like the idea of its being set to a soundtrack, that would be awesome.|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	Darker.|`|b0XiSgIbaa	I actually kind of like the single seating.

I hope they leave the line the same though.<br>  <br>  And did you ever notice, right before you get on the coaster, if you would look up to the "sky", the meteors looked like giant chocolate chip cookies?  They really did, and it was a good joke in my family and several others.  I hope they dont get rid of them :)|`|lpDXCQwoaa	Hmm, well a new track (which is what they are going to put in) because its so loud when you go up, music would be cool, bigger drops, like you said, better star effects, a queue line that makes it seem like your arriving into a space station, and cool lighting effects.|`|sCIoj3yxaa	CHOCOLATE CHIP!!!!

So are Looney Tunes/ Wilson & Yandel.<br>  <br>  Reggaeton is pretty new in the DR compared to the Bachata and Merengue.  Reggaeton is more PR than DR.   I like lots of Reggaeton and they listen to it in the DR, but it is an imported style.    Gasolina was a HUGE hit there. <br>  <br>  If you want spice, then maybe some Antony Santos en Vivo if you can find it.   Aventura is pretty big now (although they are NYC Dominicans) and they play it until you want to take a hammer to the radio.  When you live in the DR, the plinky sound of the bachata can get on your nerves sometimes, but I still love it.  If you want to talk about Dominican music, you really have to start with Voy Pa'lla by Antony Santos.   I doubt there are many people in the country that don't know that song by heart.  Bachata is over the top romantic and the guy never gets the girl.

NxR7WTVeaa	Yes, they are. There are two different groups, Northern and Southern Mongoloids. Vietnamese are part of the Southern group.<br>  <br>  "Mongoloid - Han Chinese. The Han Chinese are by far the most populous Mongoloid "group"; indeed, they are often said to be the largest single group of any race. However, they are really not a truly coherent, single ethnicity. The concept of a unified group of Han Chinese is more so a cultural anthropological concept rather than an biological anthropological one. Studies have shown that the North Chinese are closer to Northern Mongoloids such as Koreans and Japanese, while the South Chinese are closer to their immediate Southern counterparts like the Lao and Vietnamese."|`|R1Fc344laa	yes they do. this is weird but i saw this murder mystery where they found a skull and they automatically deemed it to be a "mongoloid" skull due to the shape and structure and it ended up being a missing vietnamese woman's skull who was murdered by her husband,so.....yes.|`|aDVNI2aOaa	Yes they do.  All those folks that look East Asian are all of the mongolid group.  And it matters not if they are Englishmen born to Japanese parents, they are still mongoloid even if they are dressed up in redcoats at Buckingham palace being of Japanese decent.  <br>  <br>  I wonder how the Japanese government would like to see one of their dual nationals being a Buckingham redcoat, a cultural symbol of England?

A larger number of places "validate" all or part of the cost (Rodeo Drive, The Grove, Beverly Center) Check out if the places you are going do this. Always take your parking stub with you for stamping, when you leave your car. <br>  3.

fyKSTMAfaa	Yes, it can get hot.  Heat waves with temps in the high 90s aren't uncommon.  There's usually at least one of those a summer.  But it's not nearly as nasty as the heat in the Midwest, Northeast, or the South with all that humidity.<br>  <br>  Average high temperatures usually hover in the high 70s, low 80s.  And it's pretty dry.  Rain is pretty rare in the summer.  <br>  <br>  At night, the marine layer comes in sometimes and creates an overcast night sky with raining mist at times.  But it burns off in the morning.<br>  <br>  At night, it can get damp and a little bit chilly.  But it's comfortable.  Usually doesn't drop below about 58 degrees or so.  Summers in the Pacific Northwest are pretty consistent.  Warm, with the occasional heat wave.  Moderate to low humidity.  The sun sets late in the evening.  It's basically the best, most enjoyable summer climate you can imagine.|`|R1Aixq3taa	Since I live on Maui I had hard time adjusting to the temp. in the northwest.

NM1L4B0Vaa	Corruption is rife and has aided economic collapses like in Argentina and often accompanies huge government spending.  In my opinion, Argentina is heading back into this direction again.<br>  <br>  You may find this source useful as a starting point - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_economic_crisis_(1999-2002)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_e...</a>|`|97Oe9i4iaa	It's true, the corruption affects the economy because the other countries don't trust in for example argentina or mexico so they don't invest in that places and also the corruption makes that only important people can have money while the poor people is getting poorer.<br>  <br>  Also another thing is the "Chinese invasion", maybe you've heard about that. As you know china can produce the products at a lower cost than in countries such as Colombia, Mexico Argentina and even Brazil, so that country is taking advantage of that by "invading" the market with cheaper things, for example, here in Mexico we make kind of showls by hand (rebozos hechos a mano) that are really beautiful but they cost approximately 30 dollars, so China brings shawls that cost 15 dollars made in mass production in a factory and that are almost the same as the originals, so people don't see the difference and buy chinese shawls and obviously that money goes to the chinese country.

38188c6ab8740d0d76f86bc7fdc545bfaa	OK Halvie. First of all where are you travelling from?.<br>  Teens generally wear the same type of clothes everywhere now, so you needn't worry about that. Dress casual for summer<br>  Valencia has magnificent beaches, be sure to bring swimwear. As to sunscreen, that would depend on your skin. If you are very fair be cautious. Best to get less of a tan, than to get a bad burn.<br>  Meals in Spain are much later than other countries, The normal hours for lunch will be any where between 1 and 3 pm.<br>  It is a fairly safe city, In Spain nightlife is very good, in general, especially in the summertime. Once you have made friends with your classmates you should have a roaring good time!<br>  There are shopping centers and large department stores (El Corte Inglés), plus the boutiques and shops in the center of town. You will find things more expensive than the USA. But the clothes are nice. (and spanish shoes are well known for their quality).<br>  <br>  The zoo is not very good, the rest of the places such as museums, etc. are very interesting.<br>  <br>  Here are a few good links for you:<br>  www.turisvalencia.es<br>  www.valenciatrader.com/index.php?secti... <br>  viajespain.com/tag/valencia <br>  www.aboutvalencia.com<br>  These should answer most of your questions...<br>  If you have any doubts, or other questions, you can email me via Answers....|`|Y14ZjuIKaa	<a href="http://www.fallasfromvalencia.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fallasfromvalencia.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cac.es/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cac.es/</a>|`|tQsxsuNPaa	I was only in Valencia for half a day or so, so specifics, like the beach, I can only say that I have heard good things...no personal experience.<br>  <br>  Teens wear clothes...like anywhere...jeans, skirts.  Girls wear more "feminine", i.e. ruffles, and skirts than they do in the US.  But it isn't soooo different.  If you really want to see what they are selling this year, go the catalog for Corte Inglés, and click on modas jóvenes.  That'll give you an idea. <br>  <br>  Yes, they have electricity!  Do you think you are going to a third world country!  They are actually ahead of the US in terms of a lot of their technology, greenness of fuel, recycling, etc.  The electricity is 220 volt and I believe it's DC, and you need a converter (or dual voltage appliances), and a plug adapter.  The converter is about 30 or 40 dollars, and can be bought at any place that sells luggage, and the plug adaptors...well, you might do better to wait, because most places have EUROPEAN two prong plugs, and in Spain they use something ever so slightly different.  They don't fit the same outlets. <br>  <br>  Most museums and the like are around 10€ or less.  I don't think you'll find anything even that high in Valencia, except for the Science City...you should do a search on that to get an accurate price...It looks like an amusement park in a sense, so I imagine it runs around 35 - 40 a day, maybe less for a 16 year old student.  <br>  <br>  Lunch in Spain is around 2.<br>  <br>  Probably really hot in the summer time, and probably (because of the sea) cooler at night...I was there in January! No experience!  Try going to one of the Spanish Tourism sites, and click the link for Valencia, and find the average highs and lows...Sevilla, not terribly far away, but worlds in climate!  gets EXTREMELY HOT!  we were there in June, and it was 41C in the evening, in the shade!  (about 110F)<br>  <br>  You'll find shops that are similar, and even some that you know.  <br>  <br>  An ordinary lunch, if you are buying out, can run around 10€, but if you're just doing something lite, like a bocadillo or tapa, you can get off much cheaper.  <br>  <br>  And pros and cons....it's a foreign country!  It is different!  and you'll have a blast!  I'm sure of it!  Just use common sense, and, I'm sure you're staying with a family????  Follow their rules, they know where to stay, stay away from, how to have fun, and how to stay safe!  You're sure to not run into any trouble unless you go looking for it.<br>  <br>  Oh, yeah...sunscreen.  I'm not extremely fair, but I have been warned by the doctor to always wear sunscreen...I never go out for long without at least 45.  I would recommend, if you have the sort of skin that tans easily, at LEAST 30.  Just in general...you'll be close to the water and sand, and you'll be getting all those reflected rays...I only applied once the day we went to the beach in Barcelona and we were burned!<br>  <br>  Abuela knows...:)

TOtkwcxNaa	Knotts is mostly rides although they do have a Western themed stunt show and, one of my personal favourites, "Spirit Lodge" which was originally at Expo 86 in Vancouver, BC.  They also have a variety of games and, of course, various shops and eating places.  Check out their website <a href="http://knotts.com/" rel="nofollow">http://knotts.com/</a> for information on the park and opening hours while you are there.<br>  <br>  The weather in mid April can vary however it is generally relatively decent.  Last time I was there in April there was a bit of rain and several sunny days.  Perhaps not "shorts weather" but comfortable. <br>  <br>  For Six Flags Magic Mountain check out <a href="http://www.sixflags.com/magicMountain/info/parkInfo.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.sixflags.com/magicMountain/in...</a>|`|63Ipy0NPaa	Knott's Berry Farm is more like a country fair. You can do/buy crafts like beads, jam and soap. The food is fair like but decent. It has more personality than Six Flags. My favorite ride was the old flume one, but they are all pretty good except the Ghost rider.  The ride was super bumpy and my entire family felt like we needed a chiropractor after. The other rides are fairly unoriginal but still fun. <br>  <br>  I enjoy Six Flags more because in general the rides are better and faster and I like Disney more for a theme park with personality.|`|GrdPhzv2aa	Nope...you wanna go to Magic Mountain for all rides!! Knotts is great because it is affordable and does have alot of good rides....Magic Mountain is prob around 1 hour from knotts...i would recomend going there but if you go to knotts you HAVE to try their Funnel Cake!!!|`|uwZ9AL38aa	Its really fun. i just went recently. yes all rides and food and gift shops. its sunny.i cheacked the whether online.|`|AA10155830	Knott's is a lot fun and has some pretty good rides.   Six Flags has the best rides and is a great time, although it can be really hot at times.  You should be alright in April though.  Goliath is one of my all-time favorite rides.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	I LOVE Knott's Berry Farm! Pretty much and lots of roller coasters as well!|`|j7vfbwVUaa	Knott's Berry Farm is fun. You will love it. It's mostly rides but there is also the Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant which you must visit. There is also the California Marketplace and the Snoopy's HeadQuarters. Here is more information on Knott's and Magic Mountain.
tV7ZYIeEaa	Tanning wont be a problem this is the sunshine state.  Just have good sunblock. I use a good aveeno spray sunblock that is oil free waterproof and with UVB / UVA protection|`|rSq790ksaa	I go to Florida every year and I never get tan even though I'm outside all day.|`|1MAVqGqLaa	I went to Florida Last year, and going again this year! Tan a couple of times before you go, and wear sun screen even if its only 15 spf because the sun is closer there and you will get burnt! I came back tanner then I have ever been in my life even with sun screen which I never wear.. :)|`|702f83b079a03568e52b59e470049ba4aa	Well being there you will burn quicker if you don't use something on your skin.  Most people make a last two trips to a tanning salon or spray on to start with.

I posted before I thought this through.<br>  <br>  I can't speak for plane tickets because I always drive, but I would say without the plane ticket, about $8,000. Between hotel, food, transportation (if you want to rent a car and go to any sites beyond Graceland), admission to sites and most importantly...spending money, I think this would be an average amount. I think when I go I can easily spend, when all is said and done, about 2-3000, but there's two of us, we don't usually go for 10 days at a time and we don't visit all the Elvis attractions each time. If this is your first time there, you're probably going to want to visit has many attractions as you can and you're going to want to buy souviner's - that's a given. <br>  <br>  Hotel - figure $1000-$1500 for an average hotel<br>  Gracleand Tour - figure $300 for 4 people, for one complete tour. ($70 is the most expensive tour)<br>  Food - varies depending on if you want fast food or a nicer place. <br>  Rental Car - say $250-350<br>  Spending money (most important) - I can easily drop $400 at a single store, so I usually give myself about $1000 limit, if I spend less great. Adjust this accordingly. I visit there often, so if I reach my limit, I can always get it next time I go back, or online. If this is your first time there and/or you don't plan on coming back for awhile, you may want to give yourself more spending money per person, but that's completely up to you.<br>  <br>  I know this looks like a scary amount, but it's so worth it and you will have an incredible experience. If you think about it. That's 1000 each in spending money, plus 1000 for the hotel, there's $5000. Then you had $350 for the car rental and $300 for Graceland Tour tickets. That's $5650. That would leave you about $1500 for food and other attractions. If you go on the websites of other attractions, they should have admission listed.|`|bLg4b1MOaa	VIP  Platinium  Mansion<br>  Adults                          $69.00 $33.00 $28.00 <br>  Seniors 62 and older      $69.00 $29.70 $25.20 <br>  Youth/Students 13-18    $69.00 $29.70 $25.20 <br>  Students with College ID $69.00 $29.70 $25.20 <br>  Children 7-12                 $69.00 $15.00 $12.00 <br>  Children 6 and Under           Free Free Free|`|9DWuZ5gCaa	This is the site you are looking for:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tourgraceland.com/?source=google" rel="nofollow">http://www.tourgraceland.com/?source=goo...</a><br>  <br>  You can also call them at 1-901-332-3322. <br>  <br>  ticket prices range from $28 to $69 dollars per adult, depending on which tour you take (there are 3 different tours).

I20mtK1Oaa	There are a lot of great areas of DC to live! <br>  <br>  I've lived in SE for 7 years and LOVE it.  Capitol Hill is a great area for 20-30 yo's.  There are lots of bars and restaurants and a farmers/flea market at Eastern Market on the weekends.  It's a low crime area, close to a couple metro stations and a lot of the apartments you can rent have parking spaces included.  The rent is a little more - $1000-$1300 for a one-bedroom.  <br>  <br>  If you're looking to pay less than that, you might check out Northern VA (Arlington, Alexandria, Falls Church, Ballston).  There are places along the metro which are less than living in DC proper.  But then you have a longer commute.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your search!|`|1r05fktRaa	need a car|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	What city? Maryland or DC?

hhhk499qaa	tip of the day - don't wear to much revealing clothes|`|edzU8VJiaa	The Egyptians LOVE English pounds.  A pound coin is considered a reasonable tip for a small service - but they will hold out their hands for more (don't be intimidated).  They usually expect a tip for everything, but will often do a service for nothing, or be very kind and helpful, especially if you are an older person or a (respectably-dressed) female.<br>  <br>  At the airport on arrival, hold on to your luggage tightly: you will be inundated with "porters" wanting to carry your luggage for 20 metres; they will literally tear it out of your hands if given the chance, and then have the gall to try and get you to give them money after you have chased after them to reclaim it, even though they have taken it in the opposite direction from where you wanted to go. <br>  <br>  The best tip I can give is to take a suitcase full of pens (Biros).  These are really sought-after by adults and children alike, and are much cheaper to give out than money.  We even had a policeman ask for a biro to fill in a form and then blatantly steal it; they are really that precious.  Carry several dozen with you every time you go out, and offer them as "baksheesh" to the children when you are pestered (as you will be).  You may have to go back to the hotel to replenish your supplies several times a day.<br>  <br>  Also make sure that women in your party dress modestly - they should ensure their legs, arms and shoulders are covered in public areas; on our holiday, we had 2 American girls who went out every day dressed in shorts and revealing tops, and who then complained constantly that men tried to paw them wherever they went.|`|dRkOPQSJaa	I agree with the previous answer, tipping with a ￡1 coin is NOT really what the Egyptians like as its difficult for them to change. You don't have to tip every time either, only do this if you are satisfied with the service etc. Sterling is weak at the minute, so at present I would consider taking a few US Dollars as these are always welcome, or ideally give them a tip in their own currancy. As for going out, ANY Tourist will be pestered, it's just their way, and as for going out covered, Naama Bay is VERY cosmopolitan and they appreciate that it's a touristy western hotspo,t so don't kick up about women being covered.  Old MArket is a little different as some areas there do prefer if you are more formally dressed, but are used to western girls being in shorts etc. I have been going to Egypt for over 30 years so do KNOW my stuff!!<br>  Regards|`|AA11610055	Sorry, I disagree with the previous poster. I just got back from Egypt and was told that it's really hard for people there to change pound coins. Their banks will only easily change notes. It's far better to tip in Egyptian pounds (known as LE) or with US dollar bills. One dollar bills make good tips (approx 70p currently), otherwise 10 LE is just over a pound (at the current exchange rate).|`|mbLD7AIraa	Tip of the day : Do whatever you like , wear whatever you like ...

KdHshaX1aa	I brought my own snorkel/mask but no fins. I didn't find I needed them for the type of snorkeling I was doing. Perhaps you'll want them, however, as was mentioned, they will take up extra space that you may not have.<br>  <br>  The mask, in my opinion, is necessary. Sure most resorts include a rental in your stay, but it is typically for 1hr/day or something like that, and in all likelihood you will want to use them more often than that... plus you might have to wait for them to return, and in a lot of cases you have to walk a mile to get to the area where they rent them. The convenience of buying/bringing your own, at least a mask, is definitely worth it in my opinion.|`|siHN027laa	I always take my mask, fins and snorkle with me. First place I don't have to worry about who wore them last. Secondly, I don't have to worry about losing them or not getting them back in time.<br>  I don't where you're going but in some areas the rip tides are quite strong.(Pacific Coast of Baja south, for example.).<br>  Also, you might want to check average water temperatures where you're going at that time of year.<br>  Don't get sucked into getting Certified for Scuba Diving. Many tourists have done it and some end up returning in a coffin. Their "few hour" course is a breeze but hardly enough to make one Certified.<br>  Enjoy yourself. Take an underwater camera...check out eBay. I got one that takes photos and videos with nthe waterproof case for around $100.00.|`|AA11104372	Most resorts have them available for guests.  Some loan them for free, others charge.  Check where you are staying, and see if it's worth it to buy and bring a pair, or use theirs.  Keep in mind your airline might charge for bags, so bringing extra stuff could cost you more than you would pay for fins.|`|nPSqX7Paaa	It depends... I personally love to put on my fins, because of the waves I move faster... but if you do not want to take them or rent them it is up to you and your family.<br>  If you are going to use them just once, than it is preferable to rent them there in the spot (Mexico) and if it is going to be a new hobby, than buy them.<br>  Good luck on your trip to Mexico, you wont regret it. Just beautiful and amazing.<br>  Cheers|`|7u4dXaypaa	Almost all places provide them. Chances are that your resort may even provide them. <br>  The advantage to taking your own, no rental fees and you can snorkel anytime and anywhere you wish.<br>  The only disadvantage it adds bulk and weight to your luggage.

A lot of Hollywood big stars have secretly stole away from the spotlight into this island for a couple of times since this resort was built.<br>  <br>  Then after a week in Amanpulo, you can proceed to Manila (Philippines), home of the world's largest malls, to buy all the new stuff you need to create your home, and savor the colorful and festive Philippine Christmas season, which is considered as the longest in the world, as well as the cooler winds and fresh air during this season.|`|DRPThd2Qaa	Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia are great and easy destinations. You can spend your time in great resorts and experience great cultures. But if you want to experience distinct culture then Thailand or Indonesia would be the best choice. You can choose Malaysia if you want to get the lovely nature experience.<br>  Philippines offers you a new different alternative, they have Boracay as their famous beach/ resort experience. Amanpulo resort as suggested by Matt is truly great as it is part of the ultra luxury Aman Resorts chain but very expensive indeed.<br>  Vietnam's Halong bay or Cambodia's Siem Reap also great if you are looking for a nice, quiet yet traditional atmosphere.<br>  All the destination mentioned offers you great romantic honeymoon experience, the key is to know what your specific passion and find the good valued 5 stars resort|`|60f2b52d56f0bda51d508e51cae85356aa	Bali.

Also, are you moving to Sandusky for a new job (you already have a job lined up) or are you thinking about moving to Sandusky and then finding a job?  How the economy is right now, there are not many jobs right now, so good luck if you are trying to find one in Sandusky.  I do not have a clue where the good parties are at because I do not go into Sandusky to party, and like I said before, there isn't much in Sandusky that is fun other than the tourist attractions (Cedar Point and the 3 indoor waterparks).  <br>  <br>  <br>  New York City is definitely has more fun things to do, but it is EXPENSIVE!

It is centrally located with lots of public transportation options and within walking distance of most of the tourist areas. <br>  <br>  Driving in the city can be confusing for visitors and parking is difficult and expensive so forgoing the rental car is a good idea.

2afbe6b64809eface45faf37112132c1aa	The beaches you list are usually pretty populated and have taxis coming by periodically. Palm Beach is the main stretch so you won't have any problem. Eagle Beach and Baby Beach usually have a couple taxis on stand by. If you really are that concerned, you can always take a taxi and ask the driver to return at a certain time. In order of difficulty (easiest to hardest) of getting a taxi would probably be Palm, Eagle, Baby. <br>  <br>  One big thing to mention is that taxis in Aruba are surprisingly strict when it comes to wearing wet bathing suits in cabs. Almost all of them will refuse you if you are wearing a wet bathing suit. Make sure to bring a change of clothes so you can get back.|`|VjPnHxZyaa	Your best bet would be to stick with Eagle Beach or Palm Beach that is where most of your resorts and timeshares are.  Eagle Beach is long white sandy and beautiful.  Palm is very narrow at spots and always can be a bit busy.  You should not have any problems getting a cab from either of these beaches.  There are usually cab in front of all the resorts.  As all the beaches in Aruba are public the problem arises that many of the resorts have specific areas for their patrons.  But it should not be a problem to find some place to use the beach.  I see many people doing it, especially on Eagle beach.  As far as Baby Beach goes it is a little bit of a drive but sorry to say there is no cabby near there.  Only if you arrange to be driven out there and have the cab wait for you.  Another option is renting a car for a few hours. You would probably spend on a rental what you would in taxi fare and a tip.  You can explore the coast line at your leisure and not be rushed or worried about a cab.  And there are rental cars available to you as you exit the cruise ship.  If you drive you can't get lost and the coast drive is a straight shot.  Go up to the light house and down to Baby beach all in a few hours.    Hope this helps and have a great time on your cruise.

lwVCnauQaa	it is not a scam! lol. i went on a trip last year with people to people to England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. it was the best time of my life! i met sooo many amazing kids and learned sooo much! it's not like school or anything, you pretty much go to a bunch of places and learn about the cultures. you may have a silly little quiz every now and then; but you can't fail. they also give you a high school credit once you have completed the program. also, you were sent that letter because you were either nominated by a teacher or a student in your school that has been on a trip with them the previous year. They don't send it out to everybody....even if you don't have the best grades.<br>  <br>  yes, it is expensive. most trips range from $4,500-$8,000 (most around the $6,500 area). although, you can pay by month (about $900 per month) or choose any other type of billing plan that you want. people to people also offers fundraising programs. i know a girl that was in my group who raised every single cent for her trip! also, EVERYTHING is included in the price. hotels, 3 meals a day, attractions, transportation, airline tickets, etc are all included. The only thing that you will need to bring money for are souvenirs.<br>  <br>  Misc. Info:<br>  -most trips last about 20 days (i think most trips to asia are about 14).<br>  -you go with a "delegation" which is made up of about 40 kids from your area as well as 4 "leaders" who are teachers from your area.<br>  -if you are in high school, you have a homestay...where you live with a family in the country that you are visiting for 2 or 3 days.<br>  -you have to go through a process in order to be accepted (3 letters of recommendation by teachers/adults and an interview) although, they accept pretty much everyone<br>  -you have monthly meetings with your delegation before you leave to get to meet the kids and leaders<br>  -IT WILL BE THE BEST EXPERIENCE OF YOUR LIFEEEE!<br>  <br>  <br>  the letter you received is probably talking about a local information meeting. it probably says that you have to reserve a spot at the meeting. go on the website that they give you and reserve one! once you go to your information meeting you will learn pretty much everything about the program and meet your leaders. then you get all the application process info. don't worry about the application process because they accept pretty much everyone :]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The only CONS that I can think about is the first day of your trip, you are awake for over 24 hours because you have a midnight flight and have to do stuff the entire day that ur flight arrives. Also, some kids didn't have the best homestay families and thought it was hard to communicate with them. Another con that i can think about is that you may not have the nicest leaders...on my trip i liked 3 of them but hated 1 guy.<br>  <br>  honestly, think about girl scouts when thinking about people to people. most people think its all about your trip....but really, the program starts wayyyy bfore the trip. for example, you will have monthly meetings to study/meet the people in your delegation and even have social events such as bowling! most of the kids that go on a people to people trip are really nice, smart (not genius smart...but usually honor students) and mature. you will meet such good friends!!<br>  <br>  Overall, you would NOT be wasting your time. You get a high school cedit, go to different countries, and make SOOO many amazing friendships! It really changed the way i saw the world and made me more independent.
KdHshaX1aa	I got a chance to spend some time in Toronto, for only a few days late last year. And I loved it. There is a lot to do, and you definitely can't see the whole city in two days, but if you know what you're after then you can see a lot.<br>  <br>  The Transit System is cheap, and effective. You can get anywhere on one token/transfer and get their quickly. Definitely worth it. <br>  <br>  Lots of sites, I'd recommend the Royal Ontario Museum, maybe the Toronto Zoo but that is a longer trip, and then there is the CN Tower.

In canada if you aren't 21, you can start drinking when you turn 19. There are plenty of cool markets, (Kensington, st. lawrence) it has a huge china town, it is one of the only cities in North America that used street cars as a legitimate form of transportation, there is a nudist beach on an island in Toronto (in lake eerie) and the list goes on.|`|BD1f6s3Gaa	Don't think you should do it if you are really pressed for money.

AA10254694	Cuban cigars are legal everywhere but the US.  What is illegal is for any US citizens to buy, own, transport or handle Cuban products.  Many people think that if you are outside the US places such as Jamaica that you re outside the jurisdiction of the US and not subject to its laws but that is incorrect.  Here is the rule from the treasury Department.  Trust me I am not against anyone who wants to smoke Cuban cigars from doing so, I'm just telling you the rule. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/programs/cuba/ccigar2.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.treas.gov/offices/enforcement...</a><br>  <br>  I also was in Iraq and I saw probably 125 boxes of Cuban cigars in the PX the day before Conndeleza Rice came for a visit and the day after all but about 4-5 boxes were gone.  Now I'm not saying the rules only apply to us citizens but I also know that Jack Kennedy sent Pierre Salinger to Cuba to buy 1000 boxes of his favorites before he dropped the embargo.

pcHp7Dgkaa	You will need to come on a student visa and get qualifications in an occupation in which Australia is short of workers. When you graduate, you can apply for a skilled worker visa. Your Australian qualifications and related work experience during your studies will make it easier to qualify for a visa to stay here.<br>  <br>  You will only get an immigration visa for some occupations so choose your course carefully then apply to UniSA. When you are accepted, you can apply for your student visa in time to start uni in late February. During your course, you can work for up to 20 hours per week during the official semester and unlimited hours during official uni vacations. Part time work in your field of study will give you at least some of the experience you will need to qualify for a skilled worker visa.<br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/students/students/chooser/" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/students/students...</a><br>  Ideally, study for one of the occupations on the Critical Skills List (CSL):<br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/pdf/critical-skills-list.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-s...</a><br>  Otherwise, choose from the Migrant Occupations in Demand List (MODL):<br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-skilled-migration/skilled-occupations/occupations-in-demand.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-s...</a><br>  <br>  You will need at least a 3 year (often 4 years) degree and at least 1 year's experience before you can get a permanent visa.

d6b1Dke1aa	We were just in Chicago for Valentine's Day.. and we bought the "City Pass".   It lets you in 4 museums (Shedd Aquarium, the Planetarium, The Field Museum - which is a Natural History Museum and the Science Center Museum.  The first three museums are right next to eachother, but the Science Museum is 5 miles South, and you can take the train there - red line, I think?)  And also includes a ride up to the top of the Sears Tower Observation deck, or the Hancock Observatory.    If you buy the tickets individually, it would be $111, but the City Pass was $59 and allowed us to bypass all the ticket lines at each place.  (Which was VERY nice.  At the Field Museum, there were probably 100+ people in line when we got there)<br>  We purchased the City Pass online with a credit card, and then printed out a voucher - which we turned in at the first place we went and they gave us a ticketbook with our passes in it)  <br>  <br>  We absolutely loved the museums.. especially the Field Museum.  They have a Pirate exhibit there right now.. All about pirates and stuff from shipwrecks, which might be very cool.    Also, an Aztec exhibit was there... but I believe it was ending right around the 13th or 15th of April.  <br>  <br>  If you're looking for a hotel.  We did great!  I went to priceline.com and said I wanted a 5 star hotel for $74 a night, which I thought was VERY cheap in a big city on Valentine's weekend.. and we got it!

ZcmMA4GBaa	If you like the outdoors: spectacular mountains, the sea and beautiful lakes.<br>  If you like museums: Auschwitz, Malbork Castle, Wieliczka Salt Mines, Panorama Raclawicka in Wroclaw (just one huge painting of the Battle of Raclawice), Caves "Jaskinia Niedzwiedzia", Castle Wawel in Krakow.<br>  If you like to visit different cities I recommend: Krakow, Wroclaw, Gdansk and Warszawa.|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	Krakow and the surroundings<br>  <br>  Kraków is a great place to visit. <br>  <br>  Costs are about 1/2 what they are in places like France and Spain on the Euro.<br>  <br>  Most things are a short walk from the old market square, so stay near there if you can. As such, the old town it is full of old churches, gorgeous buildings, and a very large and vibrant town square lined with cafes. There are lots of classical music concerts. Visit St. Marys Cathedral and the other great churches in the old town. Walk up to Wawel hill and visit the Royal Cathedral and Palace. Take day trips to O?wi?cim (Auschwitz) and to the Wieliczka Salt Mine, and perhaps to the Eagle-nest Castles in the mountains. Visit the Museums. <br>  <br>  The most striking thing I remember from Kraków is the Kraków Hourly Trumpet Signal<br>  <br>  Every hour a golden trumpet shows above Kraków's central Grand Square in the west window just below the spire of the higher, municipal tower of the St. Mary's Basilica. Then a characteristic trumpet signal, known and dear to every Pole, played by a live trumpet player, resounds all over the city's Old Town historical district. All of a sudden the melody comes to an abrupt end. The Kraków signal, or Hejnal Mariacki, dates back to the Middle Ages when it announced the opening and the closing of the city gates. The bugler also played it to alarm his fellow citizens whenever he saw a fire or enemy forces. And the melody's abrupt ending is said to commemorate a bugler shot through his throat by a Tatar archer in 1241.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to rent a condo near the market square, inside the Planty. I had one last June, it was great, just a stone's throw from St. Mary's. The market square has several dozen outdoor cafe's, and there are hundreds of restaurants/bars within a block or two.<br>  <br>  Drink lots of Zywiec.<br>  <br>  Warsaw is worth a few days, for all of the WWII monuments, memorials, and memories, Getto museums and memories, plus the old town. It's a 4 hour train from Kraków.<br>  <br>  Get the Rick Steves DVD on Eastern Europe, which covers these cities, plus others.|`|p7BjjPtNaa	auschwitz|`|12zRozB7aa	Wieliczka Salt Mine<br>  <br>  Gniew Castle<br>  <br>  Mediaeval wall paintings in the Knights Templar Chapel in Chwarszczany, western Poland|`|pIez7GvQaa	why people always say -auschwitz?? oh come on! we've got better places that auschwitz... i can understand that it's history and etc but it's too sad.<br>  what city you wanna visit?

I just left there. I stayed for 5 days and didn't get to do everything. There is so much to do!!! The museums alone will take up alot of time and wear you out.  They are a must see though so don't skip them.  I say if you had 7 days you could take your time and really see all the landmarks without being rushed off to the next one. It's so much fun, you'll love it!|`|Kswn0Aqcaa	Depending on how much money you have, you could go from four or five days up to maybe two weeks?<br>  You will find tons of things to do!<br>  But, if you're doing something new every day it will cost ya!<br>  <br>  I would go for about five days, but that's just me!|`|58zkb1AVaa	London England, or London, Ontario?  Either way, if you're travelling from across the pond, I'd stay longer, a week.  If you're planning on going to the top of the Empire States Building, I highly recommend buying the Express tickets and bypassing the EXTREMELY long line ups!!!  Go check out their website. Yes, it's pricey but it you're not in the mood to wait 3 hours, I bought it. $76 USD. If you do buy it, make sure you DO NOT wait in ANY line!! Because you don't have to.  Some of the staff there didn't know what they were doing and said we had to wait.   I also suggest you plan on getting to the top at a time that allows you to see the sun set as well.|`|mudP2e53aa	idk all i now im from NYC in its the best city in the world

TskZHzZyaa	Hello J!  I see you answering a lot - nice to see you seeking out comment from us too!  Regarding your five:<br>  1. Agree, it's for the tourists and kids.  I go every couple of years for meatloaf and nostalgia.  The 50's thing died out 10 years ago but EDs is unique enough architecturally that probably keeps it going, though there is one in Yorktown Mall with a semi-kitchy interior.<br>  2. I've always wanted to try it and still will for it's history more than anything, it being an icon at the beginning of Route 66.  But I appreciate your comments and won't be in as big a rush as I used to, especially in this economy.<br>  3. Never been but keep saying I will just to see what Mike Royko was writing about all those years.<br>  4. I have to disagree, i think the food here is really good myself.<br>  5. Another tradition I've neglected, still want to try it but will again delay until my personal economy is better.<br>  <br>  I can only think of the good bargains that come to mind:<br>  1. Tucci Bennuch, great food for reasonable cost.<br>  2. Dixie Kitchen for food and interior (Evanston location is my experience)<br>  3. Artopita in Greektown, relaxed and tasty.<br>  4. Czerwone Jabluszko (Red Apple) awesome Polish Buffet.<br>  <br>  Okay, typing this these ripoffs come to mind:<br>  <br>  1. RAINFOREST CAFE: Talk about raping your wallet, $6 kids meals, and of course it's my kids that keep dragging me back, seduced by the mechanized wildlife and abundant forest of merchandise that greets you coming in and has your kids begging on the way out.  Frankly I think this beats all of yours!!!<br>  <br>  2. Golden Nugget is fine but why people rave over it is beyond me.  It has gotten very expensive and the place is very old and the bathrooms pretty grungy.  My experience is with the Diversey/Pulaski location.<br>  <br>  3. Pizzeria Uno, original location - Pizza is fine but it's so crowded I feel like I could die at any minute.<br>  <br>  4. EggLectic Cafe where kids milk's are $2.50, the cost of a gallon at Walgreen's on a good day.  Been to the one in Wheaton a few times, the last time we BYOM.<br>  <br>  5. Steak-N-Shake in the burbs, prices are a little high but the crappy slow service takes away any bargain that might had been left.<br>  <br>  And I miss Berghoff.|`|bmP4NdKuaa	1 - not good since it hasn't been owned by Lettuce Entertain you for years.<br>  2-never been there<br>  3- John & Jim Belushi always said it was their parents restaurant they were spoofing on SNL not Billy Goats. Their parents were already retired. <br>  4-it's only there for the view. When the best you can say about a restaurant, good crackers, yeah I agree.<br>  5-it's ok. Because it never was great there is no change in tradition.<br>  6-Lou Malnati's Pizza - talk about overrated.|`|UhXTWNKZaa	Portotello's<br>  dude i dont live in chicago i live in baltimore i had it one time and i almost vomited it was horrible but there was tons of people there so i say its over rated!|`|iS5EbUAjaa	You didn't list Ditka's. Very expensive and definitely over rated|`|akvrwpywaa	I've never heard of Portotello's, but I really hope the answerer before me didn't mean Portillo's!|`|b1e7acd9969e11fd38ae40bfed0968bfaa	1) agree, tourist trap<br>  2) disagree, my favorite breakfast - Milk Duds too<br>  3) also a tourist trap<br>  4) never been there no comment<br>  5) mildly disagree, the food is good but ot fantastic<br>  <br>  Gino's East is hugely overrated.  Lou Malnati's is better.  Connie's is the best pizza in Chicago.|`|7gFpQB4faa	Thanks for the reviews. I agree on Ed Debevic's, but have not eaten at the others.<br>  And Adun from Baltimore - no offense dude, but it must be your east coast taste buds.  If you're from Chicago, and you want a great Chicago style hot dog, or a great Italian Beef sandwich - then you have a monster craving for Portillo's.   I lived in Indy for 24 yrs, and Dallas for 6 years, and travel the country weekly in my occupation.  Many have tried, and many sell a "replica" of the 'Chicago Style" hotdog.  But the only other place I can  find a dog or Italian Beef that good was in Orange County, CA - at .........  one of the only other Portillo's outside of Chicago.
XdGjhbfMaa	Many probably are, but for the most part Buckeye was the last area in the valley to boom and then this bust happened in the middle of it.  A good number of the homes are new construction that have never been lived in.

hLNieq8xaa	haha I was talking about this with my friends the other night.. <br>  <br>  Sara's grave is down the penrith way isnt it? I could be wrong but meh. <br>  <br>  The wine factory near Mt Druitt is still there, its over grown and abandoned. I've been there a couple times to check it out.. Its a freaky place though, if you happen to go there at night that is.. Its surrounded by houses though. I saw a shadow moving in the trees one night, and apparently my cousin and her bf saw a flickering light from the tower.<br>  <br>  People probably say she was killed and raped there because the winery is a scary place.. or whatever. She probably wasn't killed there. <br>  <br>  Don't you just love stories people spread?|`|URuzNGcyaa	sounds like a typical urban legend|`|LrBYeb6Aaa	not sure about the wine factory but there was a 15 yr old girl bashed and raped and died and was found in a wine cellar and the killer was working in a car component factory in mt duitt. very sad
jTHJhy2laa	California is better.But I would choose someplace like Ukiah or Redding in the northern part of the state instead of Beverly Hills.And if you want an ocean view Eureka or Crescent City are nice too.You couldnt pay me to live in Florida.|`|Mw5Auzceaa	Beverly Hills. Everything Miami has, plus it's in California and close to everything.|`|8XL8aC3Qaa	beverly hills! id do anything to live there|`|GWoW1o5oaa	Neither are my ideal, but between the two, Beverly Hills.

jpJy8fbzaa	San Francisco is any cosmopolitan area but it is always known for its hippie look that we see in the Haight Ashbury district and parts of Berkeley.  You'd be surprise that San Francisco people are very trendy specially if you go to the financial area.  It is sometimes very<br>  ecclectic.|`|u8Wgi7R1aa	No not at all. <br>  San Francisco has a large range of clothing choices.<br>  Many people dress very classy there.|`|BnnbW8Ibaa	No, not everyone dresses casual in fleece or hippie clothes.

9NpXU7D2aa	the day after a holiday is almost as busy as the day of a holdiay. <br>  it will be EXTREMELY busy. <br>  summer is busy regardless cuz everyone is out of school for the summer but right around the fourtth of july is probably the busiest time of the summer.|`|rSq790ksaa	It depends what day the 4th lands on. If it's during a weekend still, then it will be very busy.<br>  <br>  Just be prepared for large crowds and hot weather and hope for the best.|`|uccTPmtfaa	Well knowing that the 5th of July falls on a Sunday this year I would imagine it will be pretty packed, with it being the weekend. And it also happens to be the day after the Coke Zero 400 Sprint Cup NASCAR race 80 miles northeast in Daytona Beach, so that may even add to the crowd. I mean after the race alot of people could be headed for Disney World, ya never know. That's what we are doing but we aren't going until that Monday July 6th,<br>  <br>  But that's just a guess on my part.|`|4MGbSFKNaa	It will be PACKED...and that is an understatement. Summer is one of the "high seasons" at Disney...so be prepared.|`|6Nmly1wmaa	its always busy...ALWAYS<br>  <br>  packed parks are NOT fun at all!|`|sCIoj3yxaa	Oh boy, IT IS EXTREMELY BUSY!!!!!  But you will have fun anyways!!!!!
x9RDPwIZaa	Bottom line, it's clean and the staff is friendly.  It is set up like a motel 8 though and has a serious dorm room feel to it with some minor Disney decorations to it.  The rooms are small, but if it's a place to sleep and shower, it'll be fine.  To truly get the Disney feel, you really need to stay Deluxe, or at least moderate.  However, staying onsite gives you a lot of Disney perks, mainly extra magic hours.|`|rSq790ksaa	Honestly, that is the worst hotel of the All-Stars. Usually large sports groups will stay at that hotel and wake up really early and start practicing for whatever they're there competing for. Otherwise, it's a decent hotel.|`|FCCkrhozaa	You can read about the hotel and its reviews here.<br>  <br>  Disney's All Star Sports Resort Lake Buena Vista <a href="http://hotels.americacheaphotels.com/Hotel/Disneys_All_Star_Sports_Resort_Lake_Buena_Vista.htm" rel="nofollow">http://hotels.americacheaphotels.com/Hot...</a>|`|4MGbSFKNaa	This is one of the 2 less expensive hotels on the Disney complex. As usual, you can expect good service, clean rooms and friendly staff. The main thing is that this is very much a family based hotel, so there will be lots of children at the hotel. For me, that is the only setback. I prefer less children when I am on vacation.<br>  The hotel is "sport" themed with that type of decor. You can access all the Disney public transportation from there to get you to all the parks. Food is very expensive within the Disney complex, so you are better off snacking in the park and eating main meals outside of the park.<br>  Enjoy your trip!|`|0WASp0bHaa	this is the cheapest of all the disney resorts. the rooms are small. there will be lots of school groups there, and big families, so lots of kids. It is a big resort. You may have full buses (to and from the disney parks) and may have to wait for the next one. But hey it is disney and you will be with your friends and I am sure you will have a great time. <br>  go on the disney web site and take a tour of the resort. You can see the pool and the rooms<br>  <br>  check out site below for all disney menus and prices.

6e801dc2d4cb4e651c8b24905ccb9bacaa	The school systems in South Florida are, shall we say, uneven at best.  Pretty uniformly poor at worst. The more expensive the neighborhood the better the schools tend to be, but if schools are your first priority, think "private."   Hollywood itself is a relatively nice & not too expensive area to live.

(don't rent anything sight unseen)  That will give you an idea of costs, locations etc and then you can narrow down the search to investigate further. <br>  <br>  Then--go to the public schools website www.browardschools.com and florida.publicschoolsreport.com/county/F...  This will let you check out the schools ratings.  Or google Broward County Schools to see what else is available.  Some of the schools are very poor, however, some are very good. You must live in the distirict of the school to attend, though. I was a substitute teacher in Broward last year, and worked in schools at both ends of the spectrum. Don't let anyone convince you that all the schools are crap- they aren't. <br>  <br>  Feel free to email me if you have specific questions. I have lived in Broward for about 25 years (I am 50+ now)

4ab2ea36c0069d71d94055356c32ea00aa	Where you got your degree won't really matter as long as it's from an approved university.  <br>  <br>  In most cases, you'll start off making about $50,000 - $60,000 a month.  That's about $1500 to $1800 US.  Depending on where you live, that can actually be a lot better than it sounds.  Rent is about half what I paid in the US and medical insurance is practically nothing here.  Of course, if you live in a smaller city, the rent will be cheaper than if you go to one of the big cities.<br>  <br>  As far as other jobs go, you are limited in what you'll be allowed to do.  Knowing Chinese will certainly help.  What you'll really want to do is look for jobs that are hiring people then apply for them.  You will need a few years of experience in the field you are applying for if you plan on getting a work permit and working legally.  I don't know the exact details of this, but a good place to search and ask is <a href="http://www.forumosa.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.forumosa.com</a>   It's the largest expat message board in Taiwan.  There is a section for work questions in there.<br>  <br>  Realize that teaching in Taiwan is not necessarily an easy thing to do here.  Your English Teaching job will likely be with a school that students come to later in the day when they're done with their regular public school.  Depending on the director, your school might really be teaching English or they just might want you to run through 15 work book pages in an hour class and simply write the answers on the board for students to copy.  There is a range of really good and really bad schools and everything in between.  I would suggest really asking around and seeing what schools are worth applying to before coming here.  Forumosa also has a blacklist of schools that I am going to add one to soon...I just haven't had time.  (Avoid Sesame Street in Changhua City.  Other Sesame Streets might be good, though.  But I do find the curriculum silly for 13 year olds).<br>  <br>  I would recommend starting at Hess if you really don't know where to begin.  Their pay is a little less and there is homework to grade, but at least there are some good standards there and they do go through the time to at least put you through some type of training.  Some schools you arrive and they ask you to come in and teach the next day without you ever seeing an English book.<br>  <br>  Any school that makes you sign a contract that you will pay them xx amount of money if you leave early, run away from.  From experience, that has been a big red flag.  There are some companies that make you pay them back any costs they had with hiring you, such as Visa processing costs.  That seems fair to me, but there are some places that will take half your salary or make you put down a deposit.  Don't accept those terms.<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to scare you away.  I just want to help you before you get wrapped up in a bad school and are stuck for a year.  There are a lot of great places to work in Taiwan, but there are a lot of horrible places as well.|`|7K3RcnNcaa	There will be no extra pay for an Ivy League degree.  The government will accept any degree from any accredited university for the issuing of your work permit.<br>  <br>  You will not be paid extra by virtue of speaking Mandarin.<br>  <br>  Your pay will be based on how many hours you work.  If you work, you get.  If you don't work, you don't get.<br>  <br>  Nick R, who answered before me--I've heard bad things about Hess as well.  I've also heard good things.  It is unfair and cowardly to slam them the way you have, in circumstances under which they have no opportunity to refute what you have said.   Secondly, I take issue with your comment that if you are lazy you can teach.  It is very easy to be a mediocre teacher, and very hard work to be a good one.  It is not right to belittle those of us who chose to make the effort that you did not.

E5gaKzCsaa	If you're driving from Toronto to BC through Canada, there isn't a whole lot of choice of roads unless you make a point of staying off the Trans-Canada. Driving directions from TO to Whistler are simple: north on 400 and 69, left onto 17 at Sudbury, and stay on that, which turns into Hwy 1 at the Manitoba border, all the way to Whistler. Simpler than getting across town, right? <br>  <br>  You would be foolish to do this without snow tires. It might be okay and you get clear weather and dry roads the whole way but it would be silly not to be prepared for worse, with proper tires and other winter driving preparations. Pay attention to the weather forecasts,  don't attempt to go too fast on snowy roads, blah, blah blah. It's safe if you use your head. Thousands of vehicles drive this way every day all year long, but in winter it's more likely you'll run into weather.<br>  <br>  Expect it to take a week to get there if you do nothing but drive. It's 5,000 km, and at an average speed of, say 80 kmh, that's 62 hours of driving time, so allowing for very short daylight in winter, that's 7 days driving. Could you do it faster? Certainly, but I wouldn't if you don't have a lot of experience with winter highway driving, especially if you get a few days of snowstorm somewhere.  <br>  <br>  Driving across country in winter wouldn't be my choice, but hey, if that's what you want to do, then why not? I prefer summer when you can drive long days, when campgrounds and hiking trails are open, and you don't have to haul all the winter clothing along.<br>  <br>  Forget camping in December. Most campgrounds will be closed, and unless you come with full winter camping gear, you'll freeze your a** off even if you find one open.. Motels could be anywhere from $60 on up for a room for two.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Winter would not be the best time to be driving across the country...take the train....

MdmkM1KQaa	Are you planning on camping inside of the canyon or at a campground on the rim??<br>  If you are on the rim then it's gonna be a little cold. Last year it snowed into the month of may. It can be done with the right gear, but prolly wouldn't do it myself. If you are camping inside of the canyon, then you'll be fine. It's much warmer at the bottom of the canyon. Usually 20 or so degrees warmer than at the rim, and nothing beats waking up inside the canyon. As for hiking, it's perfectly safe as well. There may be little ice patches on the trails for the first mile or so, but after that it's perfect. I hope you have fun, if you need to know anything else about the canyon let me know.

VxfyQZ2jaa	Things to do in New Orleans:<br>  <br>  Mardi Gras and the Jazz Festival are world famous events, but New Orleans hosts many festivals and celebrations throughout the year:  www.nola.com/festivals<br>  <br>  The Saint Charles Streetcar is the oldest continuously operating street railway in the world and is a "tourist attraction" in its own right.  It is part of the public transit system, as are the Canal Street and Riverfront streetcar lines:  www.norta.com<br>  <br>  There is always music, but the bands change: Go to www.bestofneworleans.com and click on Music then Listings or to www.offbeat.com and click on Listings, then Music. <br>  <br>  Note that music clubs often advertise "No Cover", meaning there is no charge for entering. However, clubs with "No Cover" often require that customers buy a beverage each for every "set " of music (which can be every 20 minutes) so KNOW THE PRICE before you sit down. Clubs do that because some people will sit in the club all evening drinking nothing (clubs only make money from the drinks they sell - not from the music). It is also a good idea to pay for each round of drinks (in clubs on Bourbon Street) as it is delivered so there can't be any confusion at the end of the evening.<br>  <br>  An incomplete guide to bars & clubs:   www.neworleanscheapdrinks.com<br>  <br>  About certain alcoholic beverages:  Realize that some famous drinks are VERY potent compared with regular cocktails that have only 1 to 1 ? ounces of alcohol. For example, a Hurricane is basically 3 or 4 ounces of rum in something like red Kool-Aid, and a Hand Grenade has at least 4 ? ounces of Everclear + rum + vodka mixed with melon liquor.  They don’t necessarily taste like an alcoholic beverage and it is easy to over-indulge.<br>  <br>  Wander around the French Quarter, enjoy the architecture, watch the street entertainers (do tip), and visit some of the historic buildings that have been turned into museums (go to www.frenchquarter.com and click on Historic Attractions).<br>  <br>  Assuming the weather is good, you can collect a sandwich lunch and eat in the riverfront park (watch the shipping) or in Jackson Square (a very nice park). <br>  <br>  The Riverwalk shopping center has an air-conditioned food court with dining overlooking the river (www.riverwalkmarketplace.com).  The Canal Place shopping center is in the French Quarter and has a cinema and higher-end shopping (Saks 5th Avenue, Brooks Brothers, etc.).  Magazine Street is a miles-long shopping district: www.magazinestreet.com<br>  <br>  Louisiana is the only US state that offers tax-free shopping for international visitors:  <a href="http://www.louisianataxfree.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.louisianataxfree.com/</a><br>  <br>  The lobby for the Westin Canal Place Hotel is on the 11th floor and overlooks the French Quarter. It is a great place for an afternoon drink/snack:(www.westin.com).<br>  <br>  Cafe du Monde is in the French Quarter and you shouldn't miss having cafe au lait & beignets (www.cafedumonde.com). Another great coffee shop is the Croissant d'Or (at 615 Ursulines Street), which is open from 7:00am to 2:00pm and has food in addition to pastry. <br>  <br>  The Palm Court restaurant is very nice, has moderate prices, and offers traditional live jazz starting at 8:00pm: 1204 Decatur Street, tel 504-525-0200 (reservations are important and they are not open every day). The Palm Court is closed from about July 25th to about September 25th each year.<br>  <br>  Maximo's Italian Grill has great food and atmosphere: 1117 Decatur Street in the French Quarter, (504) 586-8883.<br>  <br>  All of the famous restaurants (Antoine's, Arnaud's, Brennan's, Commander's Palace, etc.) have reopened. The Pelican Club (on Exchange Alley in the FQ) is not as well known but is the same type experience. Reservations are a good idea, and probably essential on weekends.  Tujaques Restaurant (823 Decatur Street) is very traditional and has moderate prices:  www.tujaguesrestaurant.com<br>  <br>  Cafe Degas is a very French restaurant near City Park at 3127 Esplanade - which is not within walking distance of downtown (5 to 10 minutes by taxi).

Also, take the St. Charles streetcar (do not call it a trolley!) from the quarter and ride it as it makes it way to the Garden District and beyond. You'll see some beautiful old houses and realize there is more to New Orleans than just the buzz of the French Quarter.

Found everywhere, including McDonald's.<br>  Cazuela de vacuno: beef soup with a potato, rice, a piece of corn and a piece of squash.<br>  Cazuela de ave (or de pollo): same as above, but with a piece of chicken.<br>  Cazuela de pavo: same as above, but with turkey.<br>  Porotos granados: stew made with fresh beans, squash, corn, onion and basil.<br>  con choclo: with grains of corn.<br>  con pilco or pirco: with corn thinly chopped.<br>  con mazamorra: with ground corn.<br>  con riendas: with thin sliced noodles.<br>  Curanto: lots of seafood, beef, chicken and pork, potatoes, cheese, and potato "burguers," prepared in a hole in the ground ("en hoyo") or in a pot ("en olla"); a dish from Chiloé.<br>  Southern sopaipillas: a fried pastry cut as 10-cm (4-in) circles, with no pumpkin in its dough (see Northern sopaipillas in the desserts section). They replace bread. They are known South of Linares.<br>  Lomo a lo pobre: a beefsteak, fried potatoes, a fried egg (expect two in restaurants) and fried onions.<br>  <br>  Besides typical foods, you should expect food normally found in any Western country. The normal diet includes rice, potatoes, meat and bread.<br>  <br>  Sandwiches<br>  Hotdog or completo. Not similar to the American version. This one includes mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, tomato, mashed avocado (palta), sauerkraut (chucrut) and chili (ají). These ingredients make a full sandwich, called un completo. With mayonnaise, tomato and avocado it's un italiano with the colors of the Italian flag.<br>  Lomito. Cooked pork steaks served with anything that can go in a hotdog. Italiano is the preferred form but German purists prefer it with sauerkraut (chucrut).<br>  Chacarero: a thin beefsteak (churrasco) with tomato, green beans, mayonnaise and green chili (ají verde).<br>  Barros Luco: Named after President Ramón Barros Luco. Thinly-sliced beefsteak with cheese.<br>  Choripán: Bread with "chorizo", a highly-seasoned pork sausage. Named that way because the contraction of "Pan con Chorizo" or "Chorizo con Pan".<br>  A common combination is meat with avocado and/or mayonnaise, e.g. Ave palta mayo (chicken with avocado and mayonnaise) or Churrasco palta (thinly-sliced beefsteak with avocado). The strong presence for avocado is a Chilean standard for sandwiches that influences the fast food franchises to include it in their menus.|`|aLwrpMPXaa	Lots of meats and fish but what I loved most about my trip to Chile, is their wine !!|`|AA10042296	Here's a good link below.|`|AZgIkmfxaa	Personally, I have found the food to be quite bland and boring, compared with other Latin American cuisine.<br>  <br>  The joke among the gringos here is that Chilean food is: salt, lemon and cilantro, with a side order of mayonnaise and manjar for dessert.<br>  <br>  There is large variety of meat/seafood/fruits/vegetables, but more often than not it's all prepared the same way with: way too much salt, lemon and cilantro.<br>  They usually only eat loined meat (beef/pork) & often boil their meat (especially chicken). They consider hotdogs (completo- which has 2 kilos of mayonnaise, avocado & chopped tomatoes on it), to be a delicousy.<br>  <br>  Mayonnaise and avocados are trowelled onto food in ridiculous proportions & the fact that 95% of the desserts contain manjar (carmelized evaporated milk), shows a culinary culture which has little variety.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry but hotdogs (lips & assholes) and ham & cheese sandwiches are not meals.|`|7d4LaiWSaa	Right now, Antony Burdain from Travel And living's No reservation show is in Chile. It's been on local news the last few days. Be alert for it.<br>  <br>  The fact that the food in Chile is boring is true. Other south american foods like peruvian are way more rich, but that don't mean that it's bad. The food we eat is almost all foreign food from Europe or other western countries, but the touch that you can get here is pretty good. Tomato and avocado are a must in pretty much every food, but not as a main ingredient. The dishes listed here are pretty much all the typical foods, maybe one missing is the "pan amasado" that is handmade bread made with yeast and pork fat, sometimes has small pieces of scorched pork fat called chicharrones inside.<br>  <br>  None of the dishes are 100% chilean but the charquican, but is accepted that all of them are chilean foods... people even says "más chileno que los porotos" to say that something is absolutely chilean...|`|NM1L4B0Vaa	The food is quite good in Chile.  The specialties are are seafood which you can get all along the coastal cities.  You must try a dish called ceviche which is fish that is cooked by the acidity of lemon juice.<br>  <br>  One of my favourite dishes was Lomo a la Pobre (aka Bistek a lo pobre) which is some steak on top of an enormous plate of fries and a couple of fried eggs.  The arteries might strain a bit if you ate it every day, but it is very delicious and well priced.<br>  <br>  The wine is very good and they produce some of the best wines in the world.  <br>  <br>  Here are some typical dishes from Chile:<br>  <br>  Empanada de Pino - typical turnover filled with diced meat, onions, olive, raisins and a piece of hard-boiled egg, baked in earthen or plain oven.<br>  <br>  Empanada de Queso - typical turnover filled with cheese.<br>  <br>  Pastel de Choclo - a typical Chilean summer dish.

Traditionally prepared by heating fish, seafood, potatoes, some meat, milcaos and types of bread over red hot rocks in a hole in the ground. The food is wrapped in big leaves and then covered with dirt so that it slowly cooks over a number of hours. (Similar to a hangi in New Zealand)<br>  <br>  Curanto en Olla - same ingredients as the curanto en hoyo only that it is cooked in a pot instead of under the ground.<br>  <br>  Ensalada a la Chilena - sliced tomatoes and onions with an oil dressing.<br>  <br>  Humitas - boiled corn leaf rolls filled with seasoned ground corn.<br>  <br>  Milcaos - grated raw potato squeezed until dry then added to minced cooked potatoes and flattened to a bread-like form then baked or fried. This is one of the ingredients that can be found in a typical curanto.<br>  <br>  Palta Reina - avocado filled with tuna fish or ham covered with mayonnaise and served on lettuce leaves.<br>  <br>  Parrillada - different kinds of meat, sausages and sometimes entrails grilled over charcoal and served with potato salad or rice.<br>  <br>  Pebre - seasoning of tomatoes with chopped onion, chili, coriander, and chives.

If they doubt your intent to return home, you may need proof of where you're staying and your available funds.<br>  <br>  EDIT Minors can travel alone but you will need to notify the airline as some do not allow it. You may get issued with a chaperone if they think you're too young. Children younger than you are chaperoned by the airline at all times, you will probably need to be met at the other end by the people you intend to stay with and escorted to the outbound flight by a parent or guardian, it depends on the airline.

CV2zXQ1Eaa	Living on the Detroit-Windsor border (canadian side) i can say Ive never been searched. The most that has happened to me was that the US border patrol popped my trunk to look at the snowboards we had (probably looked around a little bit to confirm that we had nothing to declare. <br>  even when flying in from amsterdam to detroit, they never gave me a hard time. Im a universty student, and though its easy for then to think that were up to something, if you dont behave like you're hiding something, they most likely wont search you. they will always ask "are you brinign anything back with you?" or ask for the total dollar amount of whatever youre bringing in, but if you have nothing to hide, they wont search you. Though since you're asking if youre going to get searched it sounds like you want to bring something back with you... if you lie and say you dont have any alcohol or tobacco (esp cuban cigars) and really you do and you get caught, its instant confiscation and you will be booked (happened to my sister... she forgot she had beef jerky in her plane luggage coming back from australia-- border patrol found it, she said she forgot to declare it and was still fined $100USD or something. i would think the fine was on the lighter side since it was dearly an honest mistake. <br>  moral of the story. dont try to smuggle stuff across, but if you feel so inclined to, i felt that i could have had many oportunities to smuggle things like booze across to the US. dont give them a reason to suspect you.|`|6wGkycFAaa	First of all, your alcohol is cheaper than ours. Secondly, if you have never had Canadian beer, it will knock you on your ***! lol. Seriously though, it is really a matter of luck. They can search your vehicle for no reason at all. And when they do be prepared for them to open everything. It really is as simple as this: make sure you are driving a valid vehicle, with a valid license, get a list of what you are allowed to purchase at duty free (based on how long you are in Canada) and don't bring anything back that you're not suppose to have. Being searched is annoying but not a big deal. Follow the rules and all is well. Canada is an awesome place to visit. I know, I live here. I don't know where you are coming into the country at or which major cities you will see, but if you are in Toronto, drive to Montreal and vice versa. They are two excellent cities and Montreal has a killer night life and Toronto is our Hollywood. You guys will have a blast.<br>  <br>  PS. Obviously Mexico is not safer than Canada, however it is a beautiful country too. I'd stick to resorts or travel with people who know it well though.

The service was good, the food I thought was just fair with a choice of  western or Japanese meals and the in-flight entertainment was mostly Japanese with some western programs. The lounges at Narita are nothing special with a poor selection of food and  amenities, not up to the standards you see in places like Hong Kong and Singapore. If the price is comparable on airlines like Cathay Pacific or Singapore Airlines I would choose either over JAL everytime, JAL is a notch below the other two.

QUxw60itaa	I live in a gated community in Pretoria. <br>  <br>  I would say that you can try to go to Capetown, Pretoria or Johannesburg. I don't really know a lot about KZN. You'll get alot of white people on the Northern Suburbs of Pretoria and North of Johannesburg. If you have a map, check out the areas Wonderboom, Villiera, Waverley, Rietfontein, Mountain View, Centurion, Menlyn, Revonia, Sandton, Midrand. If you want a map just email me and ask. Well I don't have a picture but imagine this, 30 to 100 (if not more) houses surrounded by a 6foot wall with electric fence. Within the security complex you'll find CCTV cameras and a few security guards patrolling the area. The amount of security you want depends on what security complex you live in and where it is located. The houses are usually 1/2/3 bedroom houses and depending on the security complex you'll have a garden as well (which I would recommend). Some of the security complexes have houses which are packed against each other with a joint wall but I would not recommend getting such a place because the builders would sometimes place the living room of your neighbor against your main bedroom which I think is 'totally crap'.<br>  <br>  So yes there are guards, electric fences and 6foot walls. Since you're a foreigner I would recommend searching for a job at the english schools of South Africa since you'll have problem at Afrikaans schools. I think you can contact the Education department of South Africa for a list of school names or try searching on the web.<br>  <br>  Try recruiting agencies like www.pnet.co.za and submit your CV. I don't really know if you'll get a job through recruiters, maybe you must use the education department but I don't know. Or you can contact the schools directly and ask if they need teachers.<br>  <br>  Email if you want anymore info. Just know that even though Pretoria and Joburg has the most jobs and pays the most, they also has the most crimes. Your best bet might be Capetown with less crime and still a lot of jobs (and great for tourism (looks much cleaner)).<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, also what Tony J said was true, most people don't live in gated communities. Of all my friends I am the only one living in a security complex. Most of us live in houses (which people of obroad think is huge) made of brick. The houses have a garden, walls around with railings against the windows (don't know the name for this).|`|ZPxJNpMxaa	Well, I am hoping you are not thinking of hiring an armoured vehicle to take you to school and back home to your "prison", just joking.<br>  <br>  In terms of teacher requirements and qualifications here is an informative link.<br>  <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001491/149112e.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/00...</a><br>  <br>  In my opinion you have been misinformed that all or most South Africans live in high walled, electric fenced, gated communities with a security guard at the gate.<br>  <br>  In certain affluent areas in bigger cities there are those that have converted their homes into fortresses but that is certainly not the norm but rather the exception if one views it from a national perspective.There are however a number of  residential complexes in most cities that are fenced or walled in and have a control point at the entrance, the costs of which are incorporated into a monthly levy.<br>  <br>  Crime in SA is relatively high and mostly common sense precautions and constant vigilance is sufficient to minimize the risk of becoming a victim of crime.

54ee904ce0957cabc081644147eab797aa	Our downtown strip on Ouelette Ave. has the most bars per capita than anywhere west of Montreal. Check out the link I put in the sources section for a full list of bars. Here are a few of my personal recommendations:<br>  <br>  - If you're looking for something a bit more upscale, Caesar's Windsor features the VU Bar, which has a beautiful view of the Detroit skyline, but the drink prices a very expensive. Though if you get lucky on the gaming floor, I'm sure you'd be willing to splurge on some specialty drinks.<br>  <br>  - Saturday nights in downtown Windsor is party central, so I hope you're coming to visit during the weekend. If you're looking for a place to have a few drinks with your buds, I'd go to places like:<br>  <br>  - Papa Cheney's<br>  - The Honest Lawyer<br>  - Pepper's<br>  - The Chubby Pickle<br>  - Lefty's Lounge<br>  <br>  But if you're with some lady friends, or want to hook up with some girls, you might want to scope out some dance bars downtown, places like:<br>  <br>  - The Boom Boom Room<br>  - Treehouse<br>  - The Room<br>  - 29 Park<br>  - The Beach<br>  <br>  Apart from the downtown core, you'll find a good selection of pub-style establishments, such as:<br>  <br>  - Spicoli's<br>  - Hurricane's<br>  - Rock Bottom<br>  - The Basement (on the campus of the University of Windsor)<br>  <br>  Other than the bar/club scene, here are a few other things to do:<br>  <br>  Check out the Visitors Bureau website link in the sources section to see a full list of what's available in our area. Here are a few of my personal recommendations, and I've provided links for these attractions in the sources section as well:<br>  <br>  - Art Gallery of Windsor, located in downtown Windsor<br>  - Outlet mall shopping @ Windsor Crossing<br>  - Odette Sculpture Park<br>  - Windsor Spitfires game|`|b2ZwhOqsaa	i live in Windsor, and let me tell you, there really isn't all that much to do here. in the summer its a lot better because (if you are over 19) our bars are a lot busier and better. that's pretty much the one fun thing there is to do here. Also, if you come sometime in June you will be able to see the fireworks, where roughly a million people (american and canadian) all gather to watch a fireworks show over the Detroit river that lasts about 45 mins usually. also if your into skyscraper buildings and architectural beauty, just sitting by the river is pretty nice. <br>  <br>  come visit though.. were nice people !|`|CV2zXQ1Eaa	if you are 19+, theres some cool clubs you can go to, and Caesars Windsor casino is really fun. theres decent night life, you'll see a lot americans. but during the day you can go shopping at devonshire mall...other than that... well.. yea... lol<br>  <br>  detroit can be fun tho. theres a restaurant in mexican town that doesnt ID and serves a good flaming cheese. the shopping is better in the detroit area, <br>  <br>  but biggest things are definitely the bars/clubs and the casino, during the day thers not much|`|58zkb1AVaa	you should just drive a few extra hours and go to Toronto...waaaaay better, with tons to do

OZWJi4Jgaa	Michael,<br>  <br>  With tourism being Costa Rica's largest industry, hundreds of thousands of visitors get a taste of this beautiful country. Many of those that visit think about staying in Costa Rica on a more permanent basis.<br>  <br>  A reoccurring question by mostly younger non-retirees considering Costa Rica extended stays or permanent relocations is; "What type of employment is available?" or "How do I find a job in Costa Rica?". Unfortunately I don't have good news for those seeking a move to Costa Rica that involves finding a job.<br>  <br>  Costa Rica actively encourages tourism and investment as these are both in its best interest. Foreigners can visit and enjoy this beautiful country with a valid passport from most countries. The passport entry stamp grants visitors 90 days to remain in-country as a tourist. For those looking to invest, Costa Rica laws allow foreigners to purchase real estate, invest in industry and conversation, and even gain residency status if the person can prove they have independent sustainable income (ie: pension, social security, etc.).<br>  <br>  However, tourist status does NOT allow the visitor to work or earn money ... and Costa Rica Migracion strictly enforces this policy. The steadfast view is that no foreigner should take a job that can be performed by a Costa Rica citizen. With Costa Rica having a highly educated, bilingual work force - this does not leave many jobs that can qualify for a foreign worker exemption.<br>  <br>  That said; there are many, many foreign corporations that operate in Costa Rica. Persons seeking an extended, income earning stay here in Costa Rica may benefit by seeking their employment via one of these established companies in various industries such as tourism, travel and education.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The company or program should have all necessary immigration and work permit paperwork lined-up prior to your Costa Rica departure.|`|LJJ38fVKaa	the government don't let foreigners work here... is just that the government don't like foreigners taking the jobs of the Costa Ricans...|`|IAOSq3CBaa	Watch the movie Cocktail and see how it's done in a tropical paradise by real professions whom have the calling to barkeep.|`|Lc5FtItDaa	English teaching is a good ex-pat job.

There are a couple of nice climbs that will get your heart going. The last quarter mile takes you down to the creek and you can hear the soothing sounds of water as you approach. "Little River / Cucumber " Gap This was a great site. My husband and I took the Cucumber Gap trail out and the Little River trail back so we could experience both trails.The trail follows the Little River most of the way providing some small waterfalls.There are a few extremely rocky sections, some across water, but not too difficult to navigate. Was beautiful if you "love" hiking and camping !!!! <br>  <br>  Whispering Oak <br>  My husband my daughter and I went in 2008 and was wonderful.<br>  We spent our 4 days in Whispering Oak in a quiet, comfortable private countryside atmosphere, and had such a good time! The lake was about a 10 minutes drive from the cabin, at the lake the sunrise's and the sunset's are awesome<br>  We saw lots of wildlife, baby deer , deer, raccoon, squirrel, fox, opossum, armadillo –just to name a few. <br>  <br>  The park is absolutely beautiful, exceeded our expectations. We are already planning another trip........<br>  <br>  The Appalachian Trail <br>  Is the nation's premier long trail the quintessential American trail running 2,175 miles from Springer Mountain in Georgia, north to Katahdin Mountain in Maine. Whether your trip is a weekend or a one month. Extends some about 75 miles through the primitive areas of the Chattahoochee National Forest.It offers unlimited hiking adventure of exceptional challenge and variety. Ascents and descents are sometimes steep, but are often rewarded by scenic vistas from rocky outcrops and open summits.

Ang "cute" mo ( You asre cute)|`|alN2JxuUaa	No equivalent Filipino word for cute.  We usually say" ang cute mo" - "you're cute"<br>  <br>  Or you can tell him,"ang pogi pogi" mo or "ang gwapo gwapo mo talaga" -  "You are very handsome" or "You truly are handsome"|`|Ikw0ssJ6aa	no English equivalent for it...<br>  <br>  but you could say either "pogi" or "guapo" which means handsome...|`|AA10258539	"Kamukha mo si spotter."

That is how you say it in Tagalog, Cutie.|`|pm2EeEgiaa	"Ang cute mo"<br>  <br>  This is how Filipinos say to one another that they are cute. <br>  <br>  If you want the truly Filipino way of saying it, it would be:<br>  1. "Nakakagigil ka!" (Literally: You are adorably cute) <br>  2. "Nanggigigil ako sa iyo!" (Literally: I feel that you are cute / I want to pinch your cheeks) <br>  <br>  *The word "gigil" means something or somebody who is too adorable or cute that you want to pinch his cheeks. This is one word that has no direct meaning in the English language.<br>  <br>  *And another tip, the word "guwapo" (handsome) is actually preferred by boys/males than the slang word "pogi" (also means handsome) - because the term "pogi" when used among Filipino males, implies quite the opposite. When friends joke that someone is "pogi" - they actually mean that that person is ugly.|`|EHw8zCgJaa	A classmate in college once told me that the real (initial) meaning of "cute" in the English language is "Short and bow-legged".

XA2cIS3qaa	Maybe, Boeing got it right when they built the 747, they envisaged hub and spoke airlines, with the 747s the carthorses between the big hubs. Now Boeing think that travellers want direct point to point flights, and with the new efficient aircraft like 777s and 787s this is becoming more possible. Whether they get this one right, well only time will tell, but i dare say that if the a380 becomes very succesfuly, then Boeing will almost certainly strive to bring out something even bigger/longer range/more efficient - whether this be a further updated 747 or a new aircraft altogether. Boeings current direction would suggest that they are ready to leave 4 engines behind, however, i wouldnt be surprised if they revert back to it.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Aviation is a volatile industry and the future is hard to predict.  There are scenarios in which four-engine aircraft would be practical, and others in which they would not be useful.  Currently, four-engine aircraft fill a niche market for extremely large aircraft that can fly anywhere on the planet without restriction (including over any expanse of water).<br>  <br>  The key advantage of four engines is redundancy, and this advantage is important when an aircraft is far from land, flying over the ocean. Air safety regulations require that aircraft be specially certified for use over large expanses of water, based on their ability to limp back to land and an airport in the event of engine failure.  Since four-engine aircraft may well be able to deal with even a double-engine failure and still get back to land, they are free to fly anywhere over water; but originally three-engine and two-engine aircraft were not allowed to do this.  With the increasing reliability of jet engines, three- and finally two-engine aircraft have been allowed to fly over oceans without too many restrictions, but four-engine aircraft still offer maximum safety.<br>  <br>  A four-engine aircraft can also get by with smaller engines. Two-engine aircraft obviously require individual engines of much larger size than four-engine aircraft, for a given aircraft size and weight.  And, since an aircraft must be able to continue a take-off and fly to the nearest land after a single-engine failure, two-engine aircraft must have truly huge engines that permit the aircraft to fly for an extended period with just one engine, whereas four-engine aircraft don't require such large engines because a single-engine failure only reduces thrust by 25%, as opposed to 50% for a twin-engine aircraft.<br>  <br>  That's why twin-engine aircraft can climb so dramatically after take-off: they have vastly more horsepower than they actually need.  Of course, that also means that they burn a lot more fuel if engines are operated at maximum power.|`|r4IMOQ7gaa	Probably not. With the advent and popularity of the Boeing 777 they seem likely to remain with dual engines for future models. The 777 sports the most powerful jet engine ever developed - the mighty GE 90-115B, which produces 115,000 pounds of takeoff thrust and is also easier to maintain and more fuel efficient then the 747's quad configuration. <br>  <br>  The 747 was invented in a different era, it has had a wonderful and succesfull life, but technology moves on.|`|MfJkxqAfaa	not for now. eventhough boeing is on their new generation 747. boeing focus on fuel efficient aircraft but can reach longer distance. so thats why 777 and 787 have only 2 engines but have a really big one
r1IRcrMPaa	You should check if there was a case  filed against you on Police Station or do you have a pending case on any Emirates court, only then the Immigration Department has the right to put your name on their 'hold departure list'. Should there be, then you are in trouble.<br>  <br>  Most of the bank representative use this 'scare tactic' to force you to pay. Mind, you these call agents are hired by the bank to collect their bad debts and are being payed on commission basis, thus will do any sort of trick to force somebody to pay.<br>  <br>  If you find it hard to pay your Credit Card, why don't you visit the bank and settle this arbitrarily, there are ways on how to return their money  on your convenience, sadly this will affect your credit standing that may affect your persona and maybe your name will be blacklisted from their bank services and facilities.<br>  <br>  If you are planning to run-away from your bank obligations, please don't.<br>  <br>  So many Filipinos have done that in Dubai, running away with huge amounts of loan.. and the one who suffers are those who were left behind.

Viejo San Juan is the old quarter of San Juan and is only a small area where you find the governors house - la casa blanca, La Capilla de San Cristobal, El parque de las palomas, El Morro, El Castillo de San Cristobal.

aIZfiU6Kaa	I've been a few times, the first time I stopped in Nice on the way to Monte Carlo for a sales conference, the second time to Bordeaux for a week at a technical exhibition.<br>  <br>  The most memorable time though was when I was researching my grandfather's brother who died shortly after the first world war, I found his grave in Etaples cemetery near Bologne.<br>  <br>  My search started with an old B/W photograph found in my late father's papers, taken in about 1920 together with a letter from my grandfather to my father while he was in France in the second world war, asking him to visit the grave, these photographs were taken about eighty years apart.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3150/3017582138_ea67b2b5e4_b.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3150/3017...</a><br>  <br>  I went on to find the Croixe de Guerre he won during the first world war, I even got a copy of the citation.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3076/2766776329_915588aa99_b.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3076/2766...</a>|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	I have, I'm from Ireland.

mTTioMPDaa	Nobody who lives in Adelaide would ever think of swimming in the Torrens, well not since the 1920s.  Also, because we haven't had rain in Adelaide for months until just last week, any water in the river would be full of toxins and other nasty substances washed in from unclean sources.  Moreover, people dump horrible things into rivers in any city.<br>  Go and swim at our lovely suburban beaches - miles of them and clean too!|`|BJ0kC81saa	Well at the moment their really isn't much water in the torrens.

wo0UY4Vfaa	Is this a survey or what?<br>  <br>  I usually book a room while traveling... Vacations. I look for a good price and clean appearance. For a longer stay, WiFi is a must.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well when I was in the military we sometimes used hotels in our travels.  So in those cases we chose the hotel closest to the base air port, or the place that could hold the number of people traveling on the plane.  When on vacation, we sometimes stayed at hotels.  Sometimes it was location, but usually we looked for places that allowed us to bring our pets with us.  I would say now, our number one issue is pet friendly, second is location.  We are usually too tired for a pool.  We don't smoke, so a smoke free room that really is smoke free.  A clean room is a priority too, we have left hotels because they were dirty.  We are not so much as concerned with the price, even if we have to pay extra for pets, as long as we can bring the pets.|`|HEf129Hvaa	Well, if I'm going to be in another city/country, yes I will book a hotel room. I'm sure as heck not going to sleep out in the open!  =)<br>  <br>  I look for a reasonable price, that it's in the center or close to the center, and that it's clean.   Oh, and I prefer family run hotels to 25 story hotels where  you could die, and no body would even notice you were gone.|`|kgBPU4xxaa	I book a room for travel most often - sometimes just for convenience near an airport for an early flight, but more often at the destination. In that case, I'm usually looking for something in close proximity of the places I want to see. Wi-Fi or internet access is nice to have, but not a must. Location is more important. I usually like to be within walking distance of the train station where I visit for day trips.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, I stay in a hotel near where I live for a specific festival. Most recently, I spent the weekend in Venice for Carnevale the first weekend rather than going home overnight. In that case, I was looking for something close to Piazza San Marco.<br>  <br>  When I travel for business, I usually don't select the hotel myself. There are preferred hotels near the various offices in different cities.|`|g2JqGIOCaa	Since last June...  100% of my travel and hotel expenses have been for seeking employment.<br>  <br>  CLEAN,<br>  LOW RATE,<br>  WI-FI  are all required.<br>  <br>  SAFE Parking is also another must.  I don't want my 1-year old car to have door dings all over it from a tiny lot with extra-narrow spaces.|`|E3wauF37aa	we book for vacations, weekend getaways, and competitions that are out of town. for vacations and weekend getaways i look for pool, hot tub optional, decent price but clean rooms and good service, good continental breakfasts (waffles, yummy)

There really is no where around the Arch to park an RV that is handicap accessible (my father-in-law was in a wheelchair), and the rangers we talked to weren't much help at all.  It was 100+ degrees that day, and I have to say it was probably one of the worst days of my life. - - - I probably need to go back to St. Louis again just to give it a second chance.

86e53ae673b0e71a74c555f56f9f3708aa	Any unrestricted ticket that allows free schedule changes or cancellations as I think you know, costs quite a bit more than a restricted ticket that charges a fee to change a flight date. There are so many different fare classes that all have different rules, fees and penalties that it's probably best to call the airline and ask exactly what the fee to change flights is. Most airlines charge somewhere around $100-$250 US to reschedule a flight depending on the airline and the fare you paid.|`|fkHBVn7taa	depending on your airline -- but these days most airlines allow you to change without charge. <br>  <br>  Flying to Singapore I think you can be pretty safe!
