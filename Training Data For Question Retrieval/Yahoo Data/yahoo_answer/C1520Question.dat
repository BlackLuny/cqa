20090307080136AA2E84l	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does this bother you or do think more people should do this?	I'm pagan and my hubby is christian, and we are expecting our first in August.  I have decided not to bring them up under any belief, but chose for their own when they get older.  When they have a question about any belief system, I plan to sit down with them and research it so that they will have a good idea on how or what it is.  The only reason I am doing this is because I hated how I was forced into catholicism as a child and had not choice until I was older.  What do you think?
20090307080104AAH99zU	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I go to a classical Christian private school, thinking of switching back to public school?	my best friends go to the public high school, and I'm thinking of switching there. I know I get a better education at my school right now, because I've been to public school before this one for many years. but, what I really want is to be a positive influence spiritually on my best friends- who are all atheists who attend the public school. I love them and I want to be around them more, but at the same time, whenever I'm around them its harder for me to glorify God for some reason, its like he's pushed out of my mind. Temptation is so much harder to give in to, because I used to do drugs with them and hook up with guys and stuff and now that I'm a christian its different of course, but its so much harder to resist those things when I'm the only christian around and there's like a mental barrier between me and God. I DON'T want that to happen all the time if I go of course, but I really want to be with my friends and be a witness to them and everything. there are tons of pros and cons I don't really have time to mention, but this is the basic picture. what do you think I should do?

20090307080945AATd9nx	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can I skip church for a month?	Ok I know I'm taking a big risk here asking questions on here but you're all I got right now.     I do not appreciate comments like "homewrecker, slut, whore," because they aren't true.   PLEASE keep in mind that I am against adultery and would NEVER EVER get involved with a married man.  I also hate feeling emotions that are forbidden and sinful in the bible.      Second of all I have made a big huge turn around for my life because I want to be in mission college and be in missions after that.  A close friend of mine is helping me reach this goal and she said to befriend her husband(don't worry, it's only when she's around or someone else is and it's always at either her house or church and we keep it brief).  So when I get the applications ready I can use them as friend refrences.      Ok ever since I stopped being lazy and shutting myself in the room I have been socializing a lot more, sharing a lot more, going to church going to bible studies, reading bible everyday, doing things for my mom(yes I live with my parents but I won't once I move to the big city for that college) even if I don't feel like it and so on.   That is a huge change.  I was the exact opposite of all that just months ago.      Remember that close friend that's helping me reach my goal to get into that college?  Well I find myself attracted to her husband just because he's a pastor, an awesome father and has a qualities I look for in a FRIEND.        I don't entertain thoughts about him and I ignore those feelings of attraction.  I hate it because I'm not supposed to feel that way.   Lately almost everyday I've been having nightmares of us having an affair and me checking him out while he's shirtless.      Could this be Satan attacking me?  because if I hadn't made all these changes and doing what I've been doing I wouldn't have been attracted to him and having nightmares!      I want to quit church and quit going to bible studies for a month(and still continue other things around the house, bible, praying, books, helping mom) and then see if those feelings go away.      Suggestions?  PLEASE be nice! and no I would never ever be inappropriate around a married man and never ever get involved with one.  It's amazing how even after 20years of marriage they are still crazy about eachother and in love with each other it's awesome.      Again don't suggest adultery because it's wrong and don't call me a homewrecker(some people do that on here to others!)      Give me nice constructive help only!

20090307080821AAApVh6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Please pastors.....Have some compassion for a mom who has lost a son to suicide....Scriptures for her pain?	My brother committed suicide, Is he in hell?  My mom was brought up very religiously. She is having a very difficult time trying to heal, find closure and get on with her life since my brothers death. She is convinced that my brother is burning in  hell.  She can't enjoy life anymore because she thinks my brother is in eternal, unthinkable pain.   I know that Jesus must be more merciful than to send my (obviously mental and distraught)   brother to a fiery inferno with Satan. Her belief that he is in hell seems is founded on the assumption that anyone who dies with unforgiven sin is lost. What about the ones who condemned Jesus to his cross and the onlookers that were present at his crucifixion that didn't realize that they were sinning? .......They wouldn't have even had a chance to realized that they had sinned and mocked the son of God until Jesus had given up the ghost. They didn't have to ask forgiveness, Jesus himself asked his father to forgive them " for they know not what they do"  I would think that my brother in his distraught and unstable frame of mind wasn't exactly all that accountable either.   Who can be certain that at the time he committed suicide that he (like the ones who condemned Jesus to his death or the onlookers who questioned Jesus claim to be the son of God)  wasn't in such a state that he wasn't sure either.   Surely, there must also be a merciful intercession from the Lord for those that have lost their sanity for whatever reasons, be it chemical imbalances, depression, mental anguish or any other reasons.... to the extent that they take their own lives.  My brother must not exactly have had his full mind when he pulled the trigger. I believe the Lord judged him according to his accountability. My brother was 38 and had been born again in his life and Baptised. Somebody please share with me some scripture so that I can help my mom see some hope that her sons soul is not eternally lost and tormenting in hell. He's been dead for two years now and she's just a shell of herself still. Also, although I know she'd never admit it.... I think she privately believes that the Lord didn't keep his promise of saving her household in return for her lifelong commitment of serving him. She may be angry with the Lord?. This is a very sensitive question and I would appreciate only respectful and sensitive answers. Thank you to any and all who will help with scripture -and-or- offer me some advice that may help my mom heal her grief.

As I mentioned above despite economic growth India still lag far behind development. If we compare HDI (Human Development Index), we score lower than most of the east Asian countries India in terms of development, healthcare, education living standards. At  0.619. Even if we look at east Asian countries. China(0.762),North Korea (0.766), Vietnam (0.718) not to mention other east Asian countries. We criticize these countries as being autocratic but fare much better than India in terms of Human development and low corruption. We largest democracy only in terms of paper and when voting comes. Why do we not improve ourselves? because our politicians only care people as vote bank and not delivering promise, what is the use of economic growth when only handful people get benefits of that. Our system is rotten and it need repairs. We lack proper infrastructure yet we dream about hosting Olympics in India. I had lived in China and find it example we can implement in India also. If overpopulation hinders our growth we can make changes in law about family planning and marriage. We should make minimum one child policy in urban area (with exception for twins born), minimum marriageable age should be 25 for men and 22 for woman. If there are protest against these we must have enough power to suppress these. These are all for development of people and the nation. Can we have some more suggestions?

20090307051336AAoqHfg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	God Smote Sodom and Gomorrah... so when will he smite the USA?	God smote corrupted civilizations that were proud, boastful, gay, lesbian, idol worshipers, only cared about images, etc.      Example: Sodom, Gomorrah, and Noah's Ark.      America: Home of the Gays and Lesbians... soon to become LEGAL (with Obama as pres), full of Idols (Statue of Liberty), and home of Images of (magazines, makeup, earings, television)... everything is so idolized now? Myspace, facebook, pictures, statues, things that have no breath in them... Idoltry.      What my point here is... evil (in Gods eyes) civilizations never last too long... and America is undeniably becoming one of those civilizations!   One of the worst infact. In fact they are spreading their corruption to the whole world! I mean just look at how they Idolize a Woman to look like a Barbie doll? And men like Ken dolls? The AMERICAN IMAGE. Idolization... same thing.      God HAS TO SMITE AMERICA down to the dust just like Sodom and Gomorrah, because if he doesn't, he would owe them a HUGE APOLOGY! Which isn't gonna happen.      God is the same Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow, and you can use his examples given to know the future. I mean America is giving the Holy land Israel access to Bombs... God is watching every aspect of Israel ever since it was created again in 1948! America is Pro Abortion!      Sorry if any of this offended anyone, but it is fact (and NO ONE can say what God disaproves of but God) that God kills civilizations for Sexual Immorality, like Homosexuals, and Idoltry.      How much longer do you think he will tolerate these immoral people of America and the World?      Noah and the flood all over again?         And I'm even taking into consideration the REPEAT of the story of Babel (Im sure you know about it... Babylon tried to build a tower as high as the Heavens, so God smote them, destroyed the tower, changed everyones language) is the story of the World Trade Center.   If you think about it... it had people of every tribe, nation, language, all under the rule of the American Empire (Babylonian?). The World Trade Center had the tallest buildings in the World at one point, was the tallest buildings in New York until they fell, and tried to reach the Heavens. They were the symbol of Greatness of the American Empire. The Great Towers of America, tried to reach the Heavens, but were smote down...by terrorists? Or Martyrs for Jesus? Haha dont mean to sound like a terrorist or something I was just taking into consideration the striking similarities. Also not to mention the Buildings were right infront of Americas Idol the Statue of Liberty?

20090307053045AAVdO1z	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Which one makes more sense "The Force" or "the holy spirit"?	Midi-chlorians (also spelled "midi-clorians" or "midichlorians") are a microorganism in the fictional Star Wars galaxy, first mentioned in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. They are microscopic life-forms that reside within the cells of all living things and communicate with the Force.[6] Midi-chlorians compose a collective consciousness and intelligence, forming links between everything living and the Force. They are symbionts with all other living things; that is, without them, life could not exist. The Jedi have learned how to listen to and coordinate the midi-chlorians. In order to be a Jedi or a Sith, one must have a high enough concentration of midi-chlorians in one's cells.      In Christianity, the Holy Ghost or Holy Spirit is the spirit of God. The term Christ (literally, Anointed), is also used to refer to this presence. That is, the Spirit is considered to act in concert with and share an essential nature with God the Father and God the Son (Jesus Christ). The Christian theology of the Holy Spirit, or pneumatology, was the last piece of Trinitarian theology to be fully explored and developed. For this reason, there is greater theological diversity among Christian understandings of the Spirit than there is among understandings of the Son (Christology) and of the Father. Within Trinitarian theology, the Holy Spirit is sometimes referred to as the "Third Person" of the Triune God - with the Father being the First Person and the Son the Second Person. There are also distinct understandings of the Holy Spirit by non-Trinitarian groups and some non-Christian groups that also use the term. In the Gospel of John, Jesus said, "I am going to sit at the right hand of my father and when I do I will send a helper to you." Most Christians believe that the "helper" Jesus was referring to was the Holy Spirit

20090227134155AAGTufM	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Do Japanese people become mute after trauma?	In Japanese books, movies, an entertainment, it's quite common for the characters to stop talking, or become mute after an emotional trauma. I was wondering if this actually happens. Like if culturally, Japanese people have the mindset that that is what happens after a trauma, and their brains follow suit an that is how they express the trauma that happened to them. Like how Americans who experience sleep paralysis believe they are being abducted by aliens, while Japanese people believe they are being held down by a girl with long black hair. Or how people who believe they will die in surgeries, often do, even if it was only a minor surgery. Or how native american tribes often would have a vision from their spirit guide because they had been encultured to believe it would happen, while they fasted an cut themselves in the wilderness.    Also do you know any other interesting examples? I know South Korean people believe sleeping with a fan on will suffocate you, an Japanese people believe that getting wet in the rain will give you a cold. But I don't know if their minds make it true.
20090307065717AALoGwi	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you believe that God is the God of second and third and fourth and fifth chances?	Absolutely. He’s the God of countless chances. The Bible says in Proverbs chapter 24, “A righteous man may fall seven times, but he gets up.” So, clearly that tells us that God gives us second and third chances. The Bible also says, “If your brother sins against you seventy times seven, forgive him.”      So if we’re supposed to forgive our brother seventy times seven – 490 times – how much more will God forgive us? If God will tell us to forgive over and over again and give somebody a second chance, how much more do you think He gives us a second chance because He is love and He is the God of new beginnings. He gave the thief on the cross a second chance. He gave David a second chance. He gave Moses a second chance. He gave Abraham a second chance. He gave Paul a second chance. He gives everybody a second chance. Now, it’s up to us to seize the opportunity and use that second chance to honor Him and to glorify Him. The Bible says, “Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget none of His benefits who pardons all of my iniquities. He heals all my diseases and He redeems my life from destruction.”
20090307070305AAsn8bN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can you love God and hate someone?	1John 2:9-11 Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the dark. But anyone who loves his brother is living in the light and need not be afraid of stumbling; unlike the man who hates his brother and is in the darkness, not knowing where he is going, because it is to dark to see. 1John 4:20,21 Anyone who says, ' I love God,' and hates his brother, is a liar, since a man who does not love the brother that he can see cannot love God, whom he has never seen. So this is the commandment He has given us, that anyone who loves God must also love his brother. Wouldn't it be a beautiful world if everyone loved each other? Well, that's the kind of world God has planned for those who can love each other. The question is, will you be apart of it?

20090307062945AAXhOP3	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians if God is so much about grace, how come children suffer through divorce and single parenting?	Where is the grace for the kids who suffer when they are brought here because single parents believe that through grace and compassion, God will take care of them and their kids.    Where is the grace for the kids who suffer when their parent divorce.      I hear so many Christian teach about grace and compassion when someone sins, but who is really being shown compassion and grace?   Look at the divorce rate is rising through Christianity. Dads have to go out and work extra jobs to pay child support.    Through the divorce, mother has to work two jobs, take their kids to school, never having time for themselves.   But all you teach people is through grace and compassion, everything is going to be ok.    If the church teach the truth, than maybe there wouldn't be a lot of single parents. God forbid fornication and divorce for a reason. But does the church teach that. No they teach about how God loves, and have compassion and show grace.   Compassion and grace, we get by doing the will of God. Not by doing the opposite of what God commands. God said not to fornicate, but yet you teach compassion and grace.   My question to you, where is the grace and the compassion on the kids who has to deal with the compassion and grace that their parents were blessed with?

20090307062032AAQnoBh	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Preachers like to ignore this verse, but how did John the Baptist go about forgiving sins?	The Bible says that John the Baptist was baptizing with the "Baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins" (Luke 3:3).       No one wants to talk about the Power of John's baptism since modern day believers tie baptism to the idea of blood sacrifice, but a powerful kind of Baptism was going on well before the crucifixion... and it had the power to forgive sins.      So how did John go about forgiving sins with his Baptism?      Is it more evidence that the original gospel was about becoming "Children of the light" and not about becoming children of the blood?

20090227133514AA87ECb	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Ramadan: Why do some of my Muslim friends of this section claim that I will burn in the Hell Fire (Jahannem)?	Of course, Koranic theologies are contradictory. However, a verse of the Koran has explicitly implies that Allah has promised that I, Nur-el-Masih, being a Christian, will go straight to heaven on the following conditions:   i. Believing in God   ii. Believing in the Last Day and   iii. Working righteousness.      Qur'an 2:62 "surely THOSE WHO BELIEVE (IN THE KORAN) and THOSE WHO FOLLOW JEWISH FAITH, and those who ARE CHRISTIANS and the SABEANS-----ANY WHO BELIEVE IN GOD AND THE LAST DAY AND WORK RIGHTEOUSNESS shall have their reward with their Lord. On them SHALL BE NO FEAR NOR SHALL THEY GRIEVE"      So who tell u I will not make it to heaven even Islamically? Who wants to add more conditions to me that Allah Himself has omitted?

20090307062131AAzgWXE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Catholic's and Jehovahs Witnesses What About Trinity “Proof Texts”?	THE New Catholic Encyclopedia offers three such “proof texts” but also admits: “The doctrine of the Holy Trinity is not taught in the O[ld] T[estament]. In the N[ew] T[estament] the oldest evidence is in the Pauline epistles, especially 2?Cor 13.13 [verse 14 in some Bibles], and 1?Cor 12.4-6. In the Gospels evidence of the Trinity is found explicitly only in the baptismal formula of Mt 28.19.”   In those verses the three “persons” are listed as follows in The New Jerusalem Bible. Second Corinthians 13:13 (14)?puts the three together in this way: “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.” First Corinthians 12:4-6 says: “There are many different gifts, but it is always the same Spirit; there are many different ways of serving, but it is always the same Lord. There are many different forms of activity, but in everybody it is the same God who is at work in them all.” And Matthew 28:19 reads: “Go, therefore, make disciples of all nations; baptise them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.”   Do those verses say that God, Christ, and the holy spirit constitute a Trinitarian Godhead, that the three are equal in substance, power, and eternity?
20090307071917AA1hPKU	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are Evolution and Religion compatible?	Many claim they are compatible and that these ideas can coexist in the same mind without conflict. But, it's not a matter of what one believes, but why one believes it. If one has adopted a scientific perspective of his world, one has to reject the supernatural. And if one has embraced faith, cannot possibly claim to be one science's side. What cannot coexist here are the opposing perspectives: science/faith.   What are your thoughts?

20090307060151AACeFGv	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	How do you define Black people or race altogether..?	Physical traits or Craniofacial anthropometry?   Of course I would like to see how you define Black people or Race      But read this first and answer   Two ways of defining Racial Classification       Racial Classification via Craniofacial anthropometry is based on skull shapes   Caucasian, Negroid, Capoid, Australoid & Mongoloid nothing to do with their skin tone or traits but this is scientific/biological.      Racial Classification via Physical traits/Skin tone   White, Black, Asian & Native American   These are just based on visual perception only no scientific basis what so ever.      According to Craniofacial anthropometry these people are from 4 different races out of the 5 in the world but according to Physical traits/Skin tone these people are from the same one race.   Caucasian    http://www.pulitzercenter.org/pimages/30...    Negroidd    http://www.africarte.it/foto-storiche/Mo...    Capoid    http://www.nissan4x4.co.za/Gallery/Bonga...    Australoid    http://news.softpedia.com/images/news2/N...       Definition of Black in this way of classification-   Must have: Obvious brown skin tone (Light brown - Dark brown)   With also at least one of these traits:   Afro or Curly Textured hair   Broad Nose   Ancestry to the indigenous populations of Africa, Asia and Australasia.      So you either define Black people by Physical traits/Skin tone which is based on imagination or Craniofacial anthropometry which means there is no such thing as black people all together but Negroids and I wouldnt count as one...      Now   How do you define Black people or Race altogether on physical traits or Craniofacial anthropometry?      BTW If you say physical traits yet believe Ancient Egypt was European or Arab based on Craniofacial anthropometry I think your confused

20090307064836AAMrWB7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	My older brother committed suicide is he in hell?  I need scriptures to help my mom.?	My mom was brought up very religiously.  She is having a very difficult time trying to heal, find closure and get on with her life since my brothers death.  She is convinced that my brother is burning in an eternal hell.  I know that Jesus must be more merciful than to send my (obviously mental and distraught)    brother to a fiery inferno with Satan.  Her belief  that he is in hell seems to founded on the assumption that anyone who dies with unforgiven sin is lost.  What about the ones who condemned Jesus to his cross and the onlookers that were present at his crucifixion that didn't realize that they were sinning? .......They wouldn't have even had a chance to realized that they had sinned and mocked the son of God until Jesus had given up the ghost.  They didn't have to ask forgiveness, Jesus himself asked his father to forgive them " for they know not what they do"  Surely, there must also be a merciful intercession from the Lord for those that have lost their sanity for whatever reasons, be it chemical imbalances, depression, mental anguish, to the extent that they take their own lives.  My brother must not exactly have had his full mind when he pulled the trigger.  I believe the Lord judged him according to his accountability.  My brother was 38 and had been born again in his life and Baptisted.   Somebody please share with me some scripture  so that I can help  my mom see some hope that her sons soul is not eternally lost and tormenting in hell.   He's been dead for two years now and she's just a shell of herself still.      Also, although I know she'd never admit it.... I think she privately believes that the Lord didn't keep his promise of saving her household in return for her lifelong commitment of serving him.   She may be angry with the Lord?.

20090307053512AA9MaEh	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can you help me?????	Hi folks,   I'm a new Christian & I've not yet read up the entire Bible. In fact I've not yet finished reading up the entire New Testament. So I'm unknown to some parts of Bible.   Now I had an argument with a Jew who confused me a little.   This Jew said to me to apply Deuteronomy 13 with Jesus. And he tried to claim that Jesus was under the same condemnation for being a false prophet. Now I tried to argue with him, showing him many verses from the New Testament, but he doesn't seem to get it or try to get it. He wanted me to prove that it wasn't applicable to Jesus. He even said that Jesus could be one of those prophets who were punished because of their lies. He said that generation of Jesus' time passed away long time ago & yet He didn't return. Therefore, Jesus must be the prophet [of whom Deut 13 speaks] whose very few prophecies came true, but not all. Can you help me, finding out some points from Deut 13 that shows Deut. 13 in face cannot be applied to Jesus? I tried, but my explanations seemed to be VERY POOR to him, as I’m not firmly rooted in the Bible. So can you help?      Thanks in advance

I guess you just need to be a Catholic to undestand about priests.  yeah, the reputation was destroyed by a lot of bad seeds and no one seems to notice how the same thing has happened with the jewish rabbis.  Simply stated, not all priests are gay and or pedophiles and not all pedophiles are priests.  The process has changed to become a priest.  It is a very difficult process, almost like studying to be a lawyer or a doctor.  It is not easy.

I am WHITE!"      It seems to me that he has it programmed into his brain    that because he has white skin and is a member of the    "white" group, that he is special or important somehow.

I don't know enough about the situation in Sri Lanka to really have a personal opinion on the subject (not like I really have set opinions anyway). But I'm very curious as to how Sri Lanka justifies it's military actions and very specifically how it does so from a Buddhist perspective. Please don't assume I've taken a side for or against the Sri Lankan army, I'm completely neutral because of a lack of knowledge.      And more than just the military actions, how do Buddhist Sri Lankans view injustices? Do they seek to root out injustices "within themselves" at the expense of ever participating in government? Are they ever afraid they might not be enlightened enough to take any sort of political actions? Is Buddhism a silencing religion that makes people complacent? If not, how do you decide which injustices to address first? Do injustices committed against you take presidence? Or against your family? Or those committed against Hispanic immigrants in the US (just taking an extreme example to demonstrate the idea)? Please do not be insulted by these questions as I have a great respect for Buddhism and these questions have bothered me for a long time now. This is not about Sri Lanka, it's about Buddhism. Thank you.

Abrahamic Religions:   Judaism   Christianity   Islam      Certainly God choosed Abraham's family, as these three religions also revolve around abraham's descendants or family, all prophets and messengers belonged to the same family roots.      I have heard few people claiming prophet / messenger-hood, like Elijah, Rashid Khalifa, Baha'ullah and Mr. Ghulam Ahmed Qadiani, and many more, did they also belong to same Abraham's family roots or descendants. Does the people also belonged to the same family roots...?      And also Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) being a Prophet received a scripture (Qur'an) and delivered the message, Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) was a Prophet and messenger, do we still need any Prophet or Messenger, why and for what purpose...?

20090307072449AA5yjQ7	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Elemental question of light and darkness?	There are the five elements:      Earth   Air   Fire   Water      What few realize is that there are 2 more elements to consider when examining the full spectrum of them. These elements are light and darkness. I understand that darkness is more of a mental thing and reliant on speed and agility to be of any use to attackers. Other than that, I have very little to no information, I just know that as a whole these elements along with the mentioned are found everywhere.    I would like some assisstance with finding out more about these elements as  the results I get over internet are yogioh, pokemon, or game results, not the type of information I am looking for.    If oyu do not agree with my question or the validity of there being elements to start with, then please move onto other posts that ar emore up your alley and leave mine alone. I don't need a bashing and I am not going ot change my beliefs based on your reaction. (Sorry, had to mention this as I see now that religion on a whole is being attacked and is going to remain attacked by others that don't believe the same thing as I. To me this is a senseless act as no religion is more supreme then the next nor is being without a religion best for everyone.)    I failed to mention spirit as I feel this is not an element per se, but a condition. Everyone has energy I feel, and htis is the essence of spirit, be it form a person whos alive or passed on, form a tree or an animal. All living beings have a spirit, so please don't think I am being disrespectful or discounting that spirit is an element, I just don't feel it is on the same context as the prior ones. (spirit helps boost and manipulates the basics of the elements and can be felt by those sensitive. Fire cannot sense Air if placed in the same context, there must be a spirit whos element is air in order to sense fire, and vice versa.)   Also, if you feel liek questioning the above, feel free as I will look atthis periodically and would be more than happy to assisst others who lack the information on the elements themselves.   Most of what I have though is from Scott Cunningham, a pagan author who knows his elements well.    Thank you for your response.

20090307062318AA8eJFi	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Potentially Homosexual Friend?	Hello      I've decided to ask this question for additional information.      I have been finding it exceedingly difficult to analyze the behavior of a friend of mine. I'm desperately attempting to determine if he exhibits feelings towards me. All the indications point to an almost definite yes. Although, I've been trying to refrain from making generalizations pertaining to sexual advances and general boisterous flamboyancy.    It's actually becoming quite frustrating actively trying to decipher and interpret his signals. I'm quite positive he has feelings towards me.   I've taken the liberty of compiling a list of his behavior/actions      Our group of friends consists of approximately 10-13 people.   Certain members of our group generally impersonate gay individuals as an effective and facetious method of humor, consistently and profusely. Nonethess, I digress.  He insists on selectively approaching me without delving into conversation with others in the immediate area.   He occasionally runs his hand across my face.   He runs his hands through my hair.   He instinctively gazes directly into my eyes. (whenever I notice he instantly looks away)   He doesn't object to me touching him. (Although he does get uncomfortable when I continue to touch him around our group on a continuous basis.)   He doesn't usually sit adjacent to me during class. (Although, he always insists on venturing over to me and initiating conversation)   He's always at an apparent loss of words when around me. (So am I)   He generally touches me when the opportunity is available.   He looks at my lips quite frequently and touches his face and hair quite incessantly while in my presence.      It's driving me absolutely insane.   I honestly can't stop thinking about him.   I really do need some assistance/advice/suggestions.      Is there any possibility that he may be sexually attracted to me?

I think of her all the time and I saw her on the street and she asked me for directions (not realizing that we met before) I was so shocked that I didn't answer at first. A guy friend of mine (whose party it was) and who is a gossip queen, told me all about her. I found out that she is lesbian, something which I would have never crossed my mind. What does this mean? Please help me. I am a very methodical and systematic person and I cannot stand this jumping around I need help.

Go into any synagogue in Jesus' own homeland, and it isn't him they're praying to --      Another odd thing about this case was that after they didn't buy it, a guy name of Saul and Paul came along and took it to the gentiles -- to whom the God had promised nothing.      That's right -- the God had not promised any messiah to the gentiles, but now they are claiming the so-called messiah.      Here's what I'm thinking, and correct me if I'm wrong, I'm thinking this whole scenario does not add up.   .

After all, the Pope and the College of Cardinals work at trying to define truth for the Church.  They have accepted more and more scientific thinking over the centuries;  round earth, heliocentrism, evolution, and modern cosmology as a partial explanation for how life on earth is the way it is.      As I understand it, they also work at refining the Mass as the way to achieve a perfect understanding of the truth of Creation.      If they went all the way in embracing critical scientific thinking, and applied it to themselves and to their Church as a whole, what would be the result?

20090227135312AACpjF7	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	LGBT, I need some advice?	Sorry it's so long, I think too much haha. The main question is the 2nd to last sentance if you don't want to read it all.       I've noticed something about myself lately and I'm not sure how I got started doing it. A lot of times in different situations, I will talk myself down even if I know I'll do amazing at it or if I haven't even tried it before. For example, if someone asked me to play piano for them I would most likely respond with sure, but I'll probably do really bad at it or I'll probably really suck even though inside I know that I'm good at it. I've always wondered why I do this though, it's almost starting to become and automatic response now putting myself down. I know that I don't have much self-esteem for myself and barely any confidence so that could be part of it. But I also wonder if I walk into any situation with no expectations or low ones that when I do well at something people weren't expecting it and they compliment you it feels nice, but if I end up doing bad at it it's not really a disappointment because I told you I sucked didn't I? So it doesn't really hurt if someone tells me I'm terrible. How can I be more of a positive thinker? For some reason I feel that if I ever complimented myself or said something good about myself to others that I would feel that I'm coming across as cocky or prideful and I never want to be like that.

20090307082142AA2Yg8b	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you believe in God, or in the manufactured "god" which various religions portray?	My understanding is that religion for many is a very personal experience.      While some go to church, others might not, opting instead to experience God in their own way, listening to It directly, if that is possible.      It seems like religion can often be a tool for those in power to maintain order.  If drug use, masturbation, homosexuality and many other so-called "vices" seem uncomfortable or wrong, rules might conveniently be created or interpreted from Scripture to preclude them.      Religion presents not the "true" God, but rather a cobbled-together interpretation of what the members of that religion think *should* be God, at least to me.        If you believe, what is the nature of the God you believe in?

But what is the difference between say, a newly wed couple of 2 years and maybe a couple who has been together for 10 years and are very much in love but have decided not to get married. Do you believe that it would be morally/ethically, whatever, wrong for the second couple to be sexually active?   I don't understand....

Whats the point of watching TV?   Whats the point of buying that really nice car, outfit or shoes?   What is the point in getting a higher education?   What is the point in maintaining your yard with pretty grass and flowers?   What is the point in going to the movies?   What is the point of you being on YA?

He stares at me all the time and he is creeping me out. Every time I turn around he is standing there staring at me. One day I was working by myself and he came over and said, "You're finally all alone" then he stood there for a while and then said "You are fine".  I just ignored him and kept working. He stood there for a while and then got mad and walked off. Coworkers have told me that when I walk by he just hangs his head down and says, she is beautiful. If he does say anything to me, he gets right up in my face.  I have started ignoring him and acting like I don't even see him. So now he will come and stand around me and whistle loudly like he is trying to get my attention. I think my ignoring him is provoking him even more. I went to clock out the other day and I saw him standing down the hallway staring at me, so rather than walk by him, I walked around the other way. This is starting to affect my work because instead of focusing on work, I am focused on him looking at me and trying to ignore it. What should I do?

20090307074305AAIWuJ2	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why are other's so worried about what other people believe in?	I just don't get it. SO what if someone doesn't believe in God, so what if someone does. We are all entitled to our OWN opinions because it is OUR lives. Trying to figure out someone else's reasons for believing in something that is NOT YOUR belief isn't going to solve anything. Why can't everyone just understand this and worry about their own damn lives instead of worrying about why Bob is an atheist or why Cheryl is a Buddhist? What good does it do trying to convert someone into believing what you believe? Bottom line, NO ONE knows what is the truth, And no one will until the day they die. So why not just keep your beliefs and thoughts to yourselves and just lay off of everyone who thoughts differ from yours and let them live their lives the way they want to?      P.S. Sorry for being a little irritable, but I just feel what I just stated is one of the big factors of why the world is so divided and hateful at times against people who are different.

20090307095134AA4nNOn	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Transmen - Is it hard for those around you to tell that you're transgendered?	[Apologies, earlier I tried to post the question and it got messed up, so here goes]   I spent about ten minutes trying to figure out how to phrase this question, and I still don't think I've properly done it, so I'll try to elaborate.   I'm a transman, and I have short hair, I wear androgynous/male clothing, my voice is masculine sounding and I don't have any obvious tell-tale signs that my body is female [i.e. visible breasts, curvy hips/waist, "booty"]. People still think that I'm a girl, and it's very frustrating, because I just think "I'm doing all this to make myself look and feel more physically male, why can't anyone else see that?!"      I think it's because, in this day and age, women are free to dress and look how they want. I think that I'm being perceived more as "androgynous," "artsy," "chic," "tomboy" and probably even lesbian, but people still think I'm a girl. In my opinion it just seems hard for a transman to pass as a man because girls nowadays can have short hair, wear mens' clothing, look androgynous and all that and can still be perfectly fine with being a female. Transwomen, on the other hand, can easier show the world that they are transgendered, because it seems a physical man in female clothing can make it more obvious to others that she is a transsexual than a physical woman in male clothing.      I'm obviously not trying to offend any transwomen by saying that, really, since we're all technically in the same boat, but it just frustrates me sometimes. Heck, for now I'd rather be seen as a transsexual than as a girl. I'm just tired of being seen as something I'm not.      Your thoughts? I hope this makes sense. :/

And they asked Him, saying,"Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" — that they might accuse Him.       11 Then He said to them, "What man is there among you who has one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out?  12 Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep? Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."  13 Then He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand."

20090307091747AAN7klP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can I write the atheist Bible?	In the beginning there was singularity. It was that it was. And it was created by no other thing, it itself was the extent of existence. And it was neither bad nor good. In this time, there was no time. And singularity changed not. But singularity changed itself. Yeah, it changed itself. From no dimensions, sprang space and time...1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...maybe 12 or 13 dimensions, many of whom existed for moments, in this newly defined "dimension of time". And it was neither bad, nor good. Energy and matter sprang forth as well. Both equivalent, yet different. With matter being divided by the speed of light squared. As water and ice, so are energy and matter. And the matter fed upon itself. And created many complex matters. And force fields of differring natures played with the matter. And created life. And life fed upon itself. And created many complex lives. And it was neither bad nor good. And new forces arose to play with the lives. Love, Hate, Fear, Interest, Generosity...and Greed. And it was neither bad, nor good. So the complex lives fed upon themselves. And the symphonies were created. And the battles were fought. The stories were were written. And the stories were told. Over time the stories would change. But they were neither bad, nor good. And they served no purpose. They were that they were. As were the complex lives that created the stories. As were the emotions that encouraged them. As were the forces that played upon them. As were matter, energy, time, and space. They are that they are. Until they are not. And never were good. And never were bad. And neither was God. Amen.

I can understand why it would start as a focus point and then branch out to metta for all living beings~ and this worked when I tried metta meditation where you end up having metta for the whole world, but I've seen in Theravada temples where they don't branch out and limit it to just people they know (eg. transference of merits). This seems to go against the concept of true metta when people limit well wishes to people they're alligned with somehow. Or am I viewing it wrongly?

Or that we are in charge of our lives, directing our destinies?  That we are anything but the vehicle/form through which Source/All That Is flows?  Isn't the only real choice we have to waken from the dream...and reunite with All That Is in full awareness of our true nature?  Please share your comments, insights, perspectives...

I go to a Christian school, and all my friends are Christian. It doesn't get between us, never. But they are just as strict as Muslims here.. They won't allow their sisters/daughters to date, go out with boys (most of them not all of course..), drink without supervision, or anything for that matters..      And what's even more annoying is that Christians say that Arab christians are "misguided" when in fact they are the ones that truly follow their religion.      I smell hypocrisy and ignorance.

The Catholics will tell me "Yes" while Protestants will disagree. So I need an unbiased (as much as possible), maybe secular source. What classes would teach me about how the bible was formed? Where can I find honest accounts of what happened to the bible? I'm willing to study for years, I just want to spend my time studying something reliable. Thanks.      I don't really want to go to seminary, because I feel like there are certain agendas there. I would be more willing to take classes piece by piece along with my regular classes at a liberal arts college. Or I could study on my own if I could get my hands on reliable materials that aren't motivated by an agenda. I just want the truth, not anything already slanted.

20090307100303AAL5yR8	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	If you are attracted to Transgendered people, does that make you Gay? or Straight?	If you like a Transsexual, shemale, or anything similar, does that make you Gay, Bi, Bi-Curious, or straight?      There is a guy that likes women, has been involved with a transsexual, but will not become involved with man who hasn't made any effort to look like a woman... Not even a cross dresser. He only seems to go for transsexuals and women only.    This is what I thought:       Gay was only liking someone of the same sex and not liking the opposite sex...      Bi was liking both men and women alike...      And straight is only liking members of the opposite sex...      And I was recently told that liking transgendered only makes you Bi-Curious because you only got with them only because they look similar to that of the opposite sex...      So what does that make him if he only dates transsexuals and women only, but no men???

We love and trust each other full on. Our relationship has been perfect. But since the last week it seems like we have our fisrt few little disagreements. Well we have sex, unprotected. So the other day i had these two condoms in my purse. My friend put the in there during school, becasue she was about to have her purse checked and she didnt want them in there. Then later that day my boyfriend saw them in there and started questioning me about why i would have them and it seems suspicios. I told him why i had them, & he said he bleived me  but i dont really think he did. What would you think guys if your girl had some in her purse. Im a very trustworthy person and he knows that. He has no reasons not to trust me. I have no reason not to trust him.                           Guys whats your opoinon>?

20090307100816AAXkRKq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians capable of rational thought: where is the logic in Jesus dying for "our" sins?	For arguments sake, let's say god did create us; that makes our innate inclination to sin a product of his design. So, if that is in fact the case, why would he/Jesus have to die for humanity's sins? If people are predisposed to sin; the death of god and/or his beloved son (which in itself doesn't make sense) would not change that, so what did his death actually aim to do? If somebody chose to jump off a bridge for humanity's ignorance, it would not make a difference - people would still be ignorant, because without information, education etc, we're simply predisposed to be that way, so the entire notion of Jesus dying for the evergreen sins of humanity is beyond fundamentally flawed.      How do you justify your belief in this?

My neighbor has 2 little kids that play soccer outside. We live in a mobile home so as you can see there is not that much space separating the houses. They are not allowed to play any sport outside the houses; we signed a contract stating clearly that we cannot play any sport unless we go to the park in the mobile homes. But their mother lets them play and they keep hitting my car and my house. I have complained to their mother telling her her kids are denting the house and scratching off the paint on the car. But apparently she does not care, I do not know what to do anymore. Can my daughter call the police when I am not home (she is 15) and let them know what is going on and have them have a talk with my neighbor? The manager has also had a talk with her and she says my children are doing it and i am just blaming her kids. But my kids do not even play here, that is why i take them to the park. I have tried to be nice but this is getting out of hand and my daughter tells me when i leave she sees them go into out backyard and then they start playing soccer and they hit the house some more. So can my daughter call the police when I am not home? Or what do you think I should do?

So, as many of you know I had a bit of an uncomfortable situation with a very good friend of mine. I was starting to fall in love with her. Yes, her. And...after talking it over with my partner I decided to tell her. At first she was shocked and over time it turned out that she isn't too against the idea of being with me. she says she needs to slowly get to know me physically to want me in "that" way, but all in all, she isn't opposed to it, has thought about just kissing me on numerous occasions etc...      So, last night we had our fun little date thingy...and...slowly I got up the guts to kiss her. which I did, because she started singing the French national anthem off key and...it hurt. So, I told her that if she didn't stop singing, I'd kiss her just to shut her up. And she sang louder. And I did it.      And it was awesome.      She then remarked that she'd probably have to take the next step now, since I probably wouldn't again...and she kept rambling on about how she's scared to, to nervous...so i just kissed her again.      AND THEN, just when she was about to leave she pushed me against my desk and kissed me.      YAY! Soft, rose-water scented...way too short...      One question, though, she kisses with a lot more tongue action than I'm used to. It isn't really bad, I'm just wondering if I should keep going with my usual thing, or go along with hers? What does it mean whena person moves towards french kissing right away? Because it seems more intimate than the normal kiss.
