20090128133548AALLFdM	Environment;Global Warming	Global Warmers, what would it take for you to change your minds?	It seems like there has been an endless number of stories in the last year disproving or casting doubt on the man made global warming theory. Record cold and snow across the entire planet, ice caps growing, etc.   Here in Minnesota, last winter was unusually long and cold, this year has been even colder and this January will be only the forth time in 120 years that we never got above freezing.   What kind of facts do you people need to change your minds?
20090128133421AAgOQHn	Environment;Other - Environment	INTELLIGENT and informed people, I need your help!?	How much money do you think would be sufficient to fund for the research of the environmental and human effects of a possibly dangerous element...? Mind you this would be funded by the federal government.  The element I was referring to is Tungsten. It was previously thought to be safe, but new studies have shown that it affects reproduction and reproduction organs in earthworms, and negatively affects the growth of plants. It also may be that tungsten can go into the ground water supply. Levels of tungsten are not checked because the water companies do not have to check for it. Recently tungsten has been added onto a list by a government Department ( I don't remember the name) as an emerging threat.
20090128135501AAxOmTA	Environment;Green Living	Is there a point of recycling if it pass out poisonous gases?	It was on the news recently about recycling passing out poisonous gases. All recycling are collected and dumped in a different landfill from rubbish. And it passes gases just like rubbish and as a result, it's affecting the environment and people who work on the landfill. I recycle a lot and to see the news, shocks me. One person on the news says that recycling helps to reduce rubbish on the landfill and it helps financially. But do we benefit from it?

Always last to the party (remember the world wars) but when they get there they want to take change. Now it seems Obama wants to lead the world against climate change when his country is the only major nation in the worls not to have signed up.

20090128140407AAwQn0h	Environment;Global Warming	Isn't global warming a good thing?	Statisctics tell us that more people die from exposer to cold than from exposer to heat. So if the globe warms up, and heat-related deaths increase dramatically, then cold-related deaths would decrease even more dramatically.       Thus, there would be less deaths. Isn't that what we want?

20090225082942AAHysdz	Environment;Global Warming	Is it possible to have gotten the temperature increases in the late 20th century from negative feedbacks?	The reason why I ask this question some web sites are saying climate scientist Christy is not skeptic, saying that he believes in the IPCC's claim that humans are primarily responsible for most of the 20th century warming.      I found this statement a bit puzzling since Christy is a co-author of a paper that states that instead of clouds acting as a positive feedback, they act as a negative one.       http://blog.acton.org/uploads/Spencer_07...       Can a person believe in negative feedbacks and still come to the conclusion that humans are primarily responsible for most of the late 20th century warming?      Why do believers feel the need to portray Chrisy as being on their side? Is it because believers are losing faith in the AGW theory, and this is a way of maintaining their  belief?  Is it a way of saying that if skeptics are becoming believers, that is proof that we are right and you shouldn't lose your faith?

I'm also an environmentalist and I know that not all of them are like this but come on folks practice what you preach.
