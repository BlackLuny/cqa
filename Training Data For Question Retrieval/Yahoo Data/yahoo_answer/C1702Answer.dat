Giving positions to people because they are like you and think the same things as you regardless of whether they are any good at the job or not.

The goal of this conquest would be to establish the hegemony of Islamic law. As Khomeini put it: What is the good of us [i.e., the mullahs] asking for the hand of a thief to be severed or an adulteress to be stoned to death when all we can do is recommend such punishments, having no power to implement them?    Khomeini accordingly delivered notorious rebuke to the Islam-is-a-religion-of-peace crowd: Those who know nothing of Islam pretend that Islam counsels against war. Those [who say this] are witless. Islam says: Kill all the non believers just as they would kill you all! Does this mean that Muslims should sit back until they are devoured by [the non believers]? Islam says: Kill them, put them to the sword and scatter [their armies]. Islam says: Whatever good there is exists thanks to the sword and in the shadow of the sword! People cannot be made obedient except with the sword! The sword is the key to Paradise, which can be opened only for the Holy Warriors! There are hundreds of other [Quranic] psalms and Hadiths [sayings of the Prophet] urging Muslims to value war and to fight. Does all this mean that Islam is a religion that prevents men from waging war? I spit upon those foolish souls who make such a claim.    **************************************...    I was in Iran when he came back! We witnessed what he did to thousands of Iranians who opposed his return - all knowing full well what he intended, what he would do - what the country would be reduced to!    History has proved them to be correct.     And Iran is still today ruled by unelected perverted Islam clerical misfits!    Iran has not changed - will not / ever change - from that day that perverted Ayotollah spat foth in his vile speech to all inside/outside of Iran.    It still goes on! + today Irans Clerics are hell bent on possessing nukes! They don't know peace or what it means. Only to ultimately rule the world under Islam - or detroy it - if they cannot rule it!    The whole Middle East indoctrinated Islamc countries are all of the same elk. They will eventually let fly a nuke - Iran in all probaility - being the Number 1 to do it!     Irans President no more than an Islamic puppet doggy!     As per other answers / Iran is not ruled by any democratically elected rulers. It's people forced to live in the past - with no future whatsoever!    Until they stand up and throw out its perverted clerical misfits / there will be no lasting peace and gradual prosperity in the Middle East in particular.

They launched a satellite in the space yes, but since when is it a rocket? Maybe you should get better information.    Second of all, Iran says it's Nuclear Program is for peaceful purpose because they say it is not working on weapons. Many inquiries have proven the fact that they are not making nuclear weapons at the moment. Will they one day make some? Who knows. Maybe yes, Maybe not. So as of now, yes it is for peaceful purposes.    Third, since when has Iran attacking other countries?

Pot and other drugs seem MUCH more acceptable in those countries than here...even if it is still illegal in most. I am amazed at how many people I know who admit to use and admit to use and the jobs those people hold!  Marijuana would hardly BETTER his swim times. Seems to me it only would have decreased them and lowered his scores if he had used them at game time.    **ETA**You are mistaken about bongs. The first time I smoked pot was with a bong.   What job do you hold that for 25 years it was OK for you but not for him? You may say it was not OK and that is the point of your question...but then perhaps it is compassion and understanding you should be extending as well as a wish that he would quit instead of condemning the man.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Pot is not a performance enhancing drug thus not banned by the Olympic rules.

Sound familiar?  The comment was made after Phelps DUI in 2004.  Phelps comment on the matter?  "Last week, I made a mistake. Getting into a car after anything to drink is wrong. It's dangerous and unacceptable."    So at least, as far as we know, he wasn't driving this time.  Last time he ran a stop sign.  Could've killed someone.  This time he's not in competition, the worst of it is he endangers all of his endorsement deals, and so far, it seems they're sticking with him.    But smoking is smoking is smoking.  It's not good for your health.  And Phelps is a role model.

However occasional drug use by an industrious person is not an escape but a release, not intrinsically different than watching tv or cooking or reading etc.  To answer your question maybe americans are more likely to judge people by their merits, not by their habits.  Or maybe it's just you.    To quote snoop dog: 'smoke. . .'  something, what was it? i forget, whatever.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	Phelps was wrong, legally and I think morally, but some would not agree with me. But he is an Olympic Athlete. It is not President Obama, or a Senator, or something.     If there is a legal problem, then he should have to face it. But otherwise, I hope he stops and if he is going to go back to swimming that he does and stays away from drugs, alcohol, (he did have a drunk driving arrest a few years ago)     I hope no kids are stupid enough to say "I can smoke pot. Michael Phelps did and it did not hurt him", but I think when famous people use drugs and people say it's OK because of it, it is an excuse, they are already using; but use the excuse if they are caught that somebody famous did it, so it's OK.|`|6c519adeb7e7fde2ea538370b524d613aa	He was the was the    one   that       chose to do it and what a person does in private it is his business.  The problem is that now with camera phones, every one jump at the chance to prove some body wrong and to benefit. If he was to do it quietly in his home nobody would care. The sponsors should look at this, at potential trouble.

All he had to do, if he was smoking while training, was lay off it for a month.  Seriously, the man won like, 10 gold medals. I highly doubt if he was getting baked at night while winning gold in the morning.    There's many more problems we as Americans are facing, severe problems that make Michael Phelps' bong hit incredibly insignificant, so we as Americans cannot afford to give it much attention, because we're concentrating on things that MATTER, like keeping roofs over our heads and food on the table, and keeping our jobs.|`|pF63IMyVaa	shows how much you know. you dont have to be a newbie or experienced smoker to smoke out of a bong genius.who cares if hes smoked pot? your no saint. hes won 8 medals. he deserves to let loose once and a while. if it was a beer bong you people would be singing a different story. if hes training for the olympics he obviously wouldnt be smoking weither it be pot of tobacco. its another 4 yrs until the olympics. i bet pot will be out of his system by then.

If he were not a communist, I would be upset. If he is still a communist when he is 30, I will be upset."    Youth of course must have its fling.

I dont fit in, the world doesnt believe me everyones making bad choices. Me and a few people are against it. but i feel like an outcast  Im not as worried about what its making our country look like- im worried about the bad example hes setting for kids. if an olympic gold medalist smokes pot and can still swim 99000 miles, then it should be okay for them. Of course people will probably encounter it other times, but im sick of these stupid celebrity's (football players, kristen stewart, and miley cyrus who doesnt smoke pot not that ik of but still..) im sick of them not worrying about anything else but themselves. they have an image to put up and they need to be careful (aka kristen stewart who was caught smoking in broad daylight it was not a fake thing)  But its just a general thing not just michael phelps- this world in general needs to change.|`|QIhBRjW5aa	Marijuana does not have any long term mental effects.

uFbl7e4oaa	First of all, Marijuana isn't even a drug.  If Marijuana is a drug, then so are tobacco and caffeine, which are both more addictive and more harmful than weed.  Michael Phelps has every right to hit the bong wherever he feels like.<br>  <br>  Secondly, it's a good thing in my opinion that Phelps got "caught" smoking bud.  That's exactly what this country needs, a national figure who loves herb and has a shitload of Olympic gold medals.  Yet another example of how weed doesn't harm you.  It's ridiculous that we live in a place where this stuff is illegal.  It's so harmless.<br>  <br>  It makes me happy to know that Phelps revoked his apology to Kellogg.  He doesn't need them.  He's been offered better sponsorships from hemp companies.  There's a company that makes swimming gear from hemp plants.  He's also appearing on the cover of "High Times" magazine.  The fact that it is known that Michael Phelps is a pot smoker is a big step in the right direction. legalize it.|`|FnEqPhfYaa	I think there’s an important lesson to be learned here:- <br>  <br>  Kids, never share your hash with someone who has the lung capacity of a dolphin.|`|T2JlDJD7aa	Go shove a bong up your ***, Mike Master.

He's not the only one in America that very has. He did go  on to make a public appology. While kids that are young probably do look up to him, this would be the time for parents to have a talk with their kids about making right choices. I think the majority is upset that " the allamerican boy, the olympic golden boy" is human and made a mistake. So let's hope he takes better caution if he so choses to do it again.

MPCfQuT5aa	I have to agree, but these remarks are not restricted to the BBC, ITN and Sky are just as bad. The media like to make a mountain out of a mole hill. We do not need the type of equipment that is common place in many other countries. Some years we see little snow and few hard frosts, especially in the south of the country. Therefore we should certainly not spend money that could be better spent on improving services in more constructive ways.

Where I'm from (Philadelphia, which is much farther south than the UK), 6 inches of snow is a good-sized snow storm, but we usually get one or two that size every year, and not going to work because of it would be a problem.    I think people in the US, at least, are having trouble understanding why a country so much farther north than us is having a problem with a bit of snow. Most people think that Britain has regular snow and that something went wrong with the preparations, causing the problems. There are very few people who actually realize that Britain does not have regular snow, and even those that do, have trouble understanding why.|`|DphUE9tbaa	"moronic BBC'    "anti British BBC"      If we invented it but then decided not to use it because it was too expensive, what do you expect them to say?

GSOYYSUGaa	I think that the usual unfortunate women who desperately uses fertility treatments to have a child and ends up with a litter of babies deserves it because having 8 babies is expensive and it was so unexpected.

I completely agree with you, you shouldn't have that many kids if you can't support them. If they are to give her money...they shouldn't give it to her...the parent they should open up bank accounts for the kids. If you take the burden of saving up for the education, finances of 14 kids I would think you could feed and clothe them.

It often appears in cases where I wish I could do something awful to the accused even before there has been a trial.  I can understand why they used all the kinds of things they did 12 or 14 hundred years ago.  I remember the king whose head was encased so no one could see him and he was kept in a dungeon.  I also liked the public stocks used in the early colonies where people were exposed to public contempt.  That's what motivated our founders to do better by the accused.  I agree with Apollyon - in prison he would be dead meat - which in my view is too easy.  I hope he is tried publically so that everyone in the world knows his face, that he is convicted quickly and justly, that he stripped of every penny he has, then he is placed on probation and put out to make his way in the world.  I think he needs to experience the life he imposed on others finally, homeless and on the streets with the choice to live or die by his own hand.  I hope his accomplices receive an equivalent justice.<br>  <br>  I'll accept the "romantic" label.  However, over time Madoff will fail in the same way on the street.  What will happen when some of the street people have to deal with his ripping them off.  I'd like to be around then.  I agree he has the smarts to do it again.  He does not have the skill of old character disorders who could steal the shirt off your back and have you like it.

kZ8jIStBaa	Probably you will get better answers in history section.<br>  <br>  Anyway wiki has some stuff on the history of Sudan if it can help you.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Sudan#The_coming_of_Islam" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_...</a><br>  <br>  Islam came to Egypt in the 640s, and pressed southward; around 651 the governor of Egypt raided as far south as Dongola. The Muslims or the Arabs met with stiff resistance and found little wealth worth capturing. They thus ceased their offensive and a treaty known as the baqt was signed between the Arabs and Makuria. This treaty held for some seven hundred years. The area between the Nile and the Red Sea was a source of gold and emeralds, and Arab miners gradually moved in. Around the 970s an Arabic envoy Ibn Sulaym went to Dongola and wrote an account afterwards; it is now our most important source for this period. Despite the baqt northern Sudan became steadily Islamicized and Arabized; Makuria collapsed in the fourteenth century with Alodia disappearing somewhat later.

It is not really that unusual, except that in his case, he could be a flight risk.  But people with money usually can get out on bail.

The U.S.A. people have let themselves down. They continue to support a system of government that abuses them.

Can you image how much life in the U.S.A. would change if a strong third party emerged? No more "black and white," "right or wrong" devisiveness of the two party system.

Do you expect the police and fire departments to protect you without demanding cash payment on the spot?    do you expect your water to be clean and your food to be (more or less) safe?    Do you enjoy the privelege of a 5-day workweek and a minimum wage?    Do you think it's a GOOD thing that businesses can not refuse to serve you and jobs can not refuse to employ you and apartment managers can not refuse to rent to you because of the color of your skin?

b1XStRqtaa	They only had the kids for the publicity and the money and free gifts it would entail.    The family went into bankruptcy and lost their house.  Are they even citizens?  Not sure.  Why on earth those doctors saw fit to implant her with 8 embryos is beyond me. Especialy since she has 6 already. Is there even a husband around?  Their medical practice is hopefully being looked into.  From what I've read, they usually only implant 3 at a time.  She's acting like a rabbit and breeding indiscriminately and reaping the rewards.  An example of working the system big time.  All of us hard working people out there will  never see the money they will receive for her having a litter.  We will work to raise one or two kids with no book deals.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	Octuplets would be big news anywhere or anytime. But since she is not married and had apparently all these kids, but we know the 8 by in vitro, it is getting a lot of attention. It is understandable a couple trying for years to have kids to go through in vitro or artificial insemination, but with 6 already, no matter how they were conceived, then in vitro that led to 8, is hard to imagine. The cost alone is enormous. She must be rich or something, I mean couples going through in vitro pay tens or hundreds of thousands.     At first I was defending her because I just thought people were against her having in vitro or something, but it is strange with all of those kids to have more. Some question if the clinic should have agreed to implant more embryos in her.     I pray the babies are OK and that she can afford to raise all of them and can have some help. But I do question her judgment.|`|981ae6721baf70bba18f8ca87d655a38aa	Only because its making them money. Why else?

Britney's behaving herself now so they're looking for other things like the woman with the amazing uterus.    I heard on the news this morning that to support herself, she sells her ovarian eggs, 10K a pop. She has 2 houses, to give you an idea of how many eggs she'd have to sell. Can you imagine how many kids share half her DNA?     Spokeman, books, movie, Oprah, endorsements. All she did was do what hundreds of female dogs do every day around he world. Who does she think she is? Does she think that we think she's oh-so important? This woman sounds greedy and self-important. The media should starve her out of the news.   Argh. It makes me want to grind my teeth.|`|413999ce3344ac9070b2bf70d21ebe12aa	I heard on cnn last night that all 14 of these children have the same father.   If he is in fact just going to a sperm bank can he be held responsible for child support?  I think if he willingly donated the sperm he would have to support them.  I also heard he tried to marry her some time ago but she did not want to get married.  I just pray to God she is a legal immigrant.  If not, this example should make the government change the constitution on "anchor babies".  And, if she is illegal, the citizens and legal immigrants are in the hole 3.5B or better by the time the babies get out of the hospital.  This doesn't even include welfare and medicaid til they reach age 18.|`|b2ZwhOqsaa	shes just a lazy broad. really i feel bad for those babies cus theres no way she will be able to take care of them financially or otherwise. she doesnt even have a job. so all her money comes from us, the taxpayers.    just about everyone can have babies, shes really not that special.  Why on earth would doctors give her babies thru invitro fully knowing shes unemployed and a single mother.|`|JMMCVZIJaa	It's just the ethics of it all.  She already had 6, so why would she get pregnant with 8 more?  And what doctor would allow that?    Not just that, like you wrote, she is a single mother.  What single mother can provide for 14 without government assistance...ie having US provide for her and her children?  She did this on purpose and irresponsibly.      I wouldn't be surprised if they are headed down a "fit parent" road since she knew she couldn't provide for all those kids but decided to have artificial insemination resulting in multiple births, anyway.|`|944e2748d03e1efff042dce931e63f28aa	She's going to have to be careful as the majority of the public and medical community is outraged.  I understand that she will probably want to speak for herself and try to explain it.  She should act fast, the longer she sits on it the more likely the deals will dry up as the public continues to turn on her.    Of course people will come to her.  If I were an investigative journalist, I too would want an interview.  I would want to know what was wrong with her, why she made such poor choices, which doctor she used so that we can take their medical license away from her.  The attention she's going to get is not going to be positive.|`|QVKWVValaa	Hopefully as encouragement to others to use birth control.|`|RgO3Sn38aa	CPS is going to be watching her like a hawk.  It's just a matter of time before they find some reason to snatch them into foster care.  She can't possibly care for those children alone, I don't care how much money she will get from books, TV shows, etc.  Unless she is funded enough from those sources for 18 years (and that I doubt), and can afford like three nannies, she is never going to be able to pull it off.  The media blitz will end, the money cut off, and then what?    If she gets ill, has to be hospitalized, has an emergency who will she call to step in and care for those kids?    What if there is a house fire from one of those kids playing with matches?  Who will get all those kids out of the house in time?    Minors are never to be left alone at home.  What if she has to rush one of the babies to the hospital?  Will she drag all eight babies with her plus the older ones?  How?    The lady is clearly not the brightest star in the sky.  In this economy, people have trouble taking care of two kids.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	People are curious and are just panting and dripping slobbers making judgment on this woman.|`|sOJRn24paa	It's so amazing and different that's why!
UNw3L5qfaa	Its hardly a commitment is it? And, although my political jargon understanding isn't great, when it says:<br>  "including by contributions to international, governmental, and nongovernmental organisations and payment of administrative expenses of Bureau of Population", in my mind that means that it is not $20m going to a refugee camp. Maybe $2m is going to admin, a further $7m possibly to UN human rights contributions, etc, and Gaza has just been used in context rather than the aim.<br>  <br>  As has been said, this is a farce. In 1997 alone the US "donated" over $5.5 Billion to Israel, which is a fact.<br>  <br>  I don't know how much Obama plans to sacrifice to AIPAC and Israel is his budget, but as we all know in US politics if you're against unwavering support of Israel, your career is short lived.<br>  <br>  Simply cutting unwavering ties with Israel would increase national security so much. America would no longer be the target for terrorism.<br>  <br>  If Saudi Arabia had unwavering support of the Taliban, you know the US would do all it could to stop Saudi arabia having that support and arming them. Why is the US surprised then when the Middle east and Asia, and an increasing population in europe is generating a hate for America as a result of unwavering support of Israel?<br>  <br>  But, no i do not believe Obama will make any real "change" in the middle east. All of his foreign affairs officials and middle east correspondents have been described as "Israeli Hawks", i.e pro-Israelis.<br>  <br>  I don't know wether to cry or laugh anymore when i see people like dragon saying things like "oh no it will go to weapons aimed at innocent Israelis" etc. There is a distinct lack of understanding of the conflict in a lot of people, and those same people still try and spread what they have learned on fox on the internet. Fox says "Palestinians = Hamas, bad, terrorists, killing for no reason, human shields boooooo, on the other hand Israel, such a nice place, they just want peace, innocent, defending themselves, allie, the good guys yey."<br>  <br>  I wrote that as a joke, and actually its pretty accurate as to people's impressions of the conflict.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	I don't know how they will get any aid to the Palestinians in need; I think it wwould be sold to pay for more weapons to attack Israeli civilians.|`|bYtCfdwbaa	Money is not the solution.When he starts questioning America's unconditional support of Israel's appalling heavy handed tactics then we might actually be getting somewhere.|`|5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	$20.3 Million?<br>  Well that shows a great deal of magnaminity. Specially when put alongside the $2 BILLION that the US is committed to donating to Israel in loan guarantees, and the $1.5 BILLION that US citizens will donate to that country.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  Misty Blue, I am sure there are those who would say that you are obviously antisemitic, even though I'm sure you are not.<br>  They will choose to ignore the fact that you are, spot on, right.

My friend who lives in London did send me pictures of her driveway and they had about 6inches of snow sitting on everything, but there were cars in the background actually driving down the road!  In London!  I thought they had started to build igloos there.    We only got about an inch here in my part of Oxfordshire, but even schools locally here had to close down.

Yup the "over-reaction" has certainly effected they economy and been a complete waste of time.

QVKWVValaa	Two of the world's most bitter enemies - Pakistan and India - have had nuclear weapons for over 30 years. Neither of them has used them on the other. Why? For the exact same reason the U.S. and the Soviet Union (Russia) never nuked each other. It would be MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction).  Nuclear weapons are only a threat. No nation other than the U.S. would ever be insane enough to use them on another nation. I'm not a fan of Iran developing nuclear weapons, but even if they did the nukes would be useless. Just like the stockpiles of nukes in America, Russia, Pakistan and India.|`|RVWyPicKaa	Means that they are clever:     "To the enemy who fears that the muslims will obtain in an atom bomb let him know that this bomb landed on the day Islam was born"    Consider that.

Maybe Iran just wants to get into the space race. After all when Russia launched Sputnik in 1957, some Americans were terrified they were going to bomb us with it, but it just evolved into the space race. OK, we both developed ICBMs (Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles) and could have gone to WWIII but did not.     OK, Iran is not trying to get to the moon, I don't think. (But the moon is a sacred symbol in Islam, so you never know)    Seriously, Iran is a dangerous country, with a dangerous leader, but it's just possible he wants an attack from Israel so they will be martyrs or something. I would say for Israel to be very cautious.|`|yKA70D41aa	Iran launched its first satellite into space.

ae530cfc7c3f9fd6506b72dc76a8d126aa	What else would you expect from a racist bully other than the release of a thug who was part of a gang who seriously assaulted a train driver for their own greed?<br>  <br>  Ronnie Biggs should be left to rot in jail until the day he dies.|`|hZIVKiFdaa	Is this a wedding? Sounds more like a circus!|`|S8RL9lieaa	This has gone so far over the top it's begining to resemble a circus.|`|ajPHMliqaa	poor old Ronnie Biggs.he had a bit part in a money robbery but because he escaped and lived the high life in Brazil while poking the finger at them the uk govt have locked a sick old man up for the past 10 years................in this world u can murder someone and be out in 5-7 years but if u are working class and steal some money they throw away the key on u...................yet those bankers who have bankrupted this country say they are sorry and then go back to their luxurious lifestyle............this world stinks..................go back to your TVs now for more brainwashing by the lies of the matrix|`|TBPzDU2vaa	In a manner it has .. yet, we might be able to learn something from this sad life.  Appreciate what we have!!  As for Ronnie Biggs, don't know the young man,should Jade want to marry him plus he doesn't seem to object .. best of happiness to them!|`|AA11015890	Not sure whether you're being serious but, if you are, then that's ridiculous.  Of course he shouldn't be released just to attend the wedding!|`|zpIrU1yCaa	It all went to far when she started playing the role of the world's first cancer victim!  I think she is taking the piss now and should just take what is left of her dignity and disappear.<br>  <br>  I am sick of all the special treatment she is getting.  Let's face it, how many other grooms would be let off their tag for their wedding night under the same circumstances?  Everyone else would just be told that rules are rules but it seems that these two can get whatever they want.|`|G8zAPz8Maa	here we have a stupid woman who is worshipped by the other low life that cannot think for themselves and are told what to think by the media.<br>  <br>  Imagine how many families are going through redundancy and house repossessions and have to bear the thought of that poorly educated, racist woman getting paid ￡1m for marrying a convicted criminal.|`|04a31323aa0674874fbc03558306d39eaa	yes, ridiculous, just have your wedding in peace Jade and stop telling the paps every single little thing!|`|774c0eb5f31b806e89824993621a7184aa	Have you seen the photos? It looks like something out of Eastenders.|`|dc358f19f97d8746ff79e2669815ac77aa	Mmm, interesting but surely not true?|`|x6bbhRcHaa	its all max cliffords hype.the sooner shes history the better.biggs should have been released a long time ago|`|yotUSWcIaa	This really annoys me. What kind of an excuse is that for release?|`|MNja3iwMaa	she really is making this illness into a farce!!
OUVDLlw1aa	All good things must come to an end....but go not quietly into those dark and dreary halls of learning....take a snowball with you!!!|`|ZrxJhk44aa	lets all hope that you HAVE to go to school. LOL hey tom. errm i think it will stop on friday. So school may well be cancelled
dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	Yes, we do negotiate with pirates; and they are different then the standard terrorists who just kill innocent people for just being who they are.  These pirates are conducting criminal activities for the sole purpose of ransom money.      We should pay a reasonable, negotiated ransom (one or two million) for the safe return of this Captain, and then go after them with full force.|`|qibtUmiLaa	I think we should negotiate the amount of pain they go through as they die.|`|aMloynjWaa	Pirates are another form of terrorists.  Wouldn't you say?  I hope they would not pay for the release of the Captain.  We have already paid too much as it is now.|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	1 million dollars|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	we will not pay for his release|`|CDmGlLXCaa	we have reporters that are being held hostage elsewhere..i don't think we are going to pay any money but we will have military there negotiating|`|IiRrsNFJaa	pirates are a media word for making the article more appealing.  pay now for his release. Next time these thugs attack...drop them in their boats with trained snipers. Get rid of the sniper rifles before they pull in to port so they dont get fined for breakng international laws.  How simple can I get here.
iaHM24Xjaa	They are happening all the time, it just happens that they are receiving alot of publicity in the media lately. <br>  But i've only heard of 3-4 lately!|`|t27SvIPbaa	The flight that drooped from the sky in Buffalo for no reason was deliberate and the black box has not been disclosed just like the four planes on 9/11.<br>  <br>  On board that plane in Buffalo was a leading campaigner against the government as her husband was killed in 9/11.  She was suing the government and insisted on a new investigation.    Funny how so many political activists and conspiracy theorists are shot or die in aeroplane crashes.<br>  <br>  Watch all the clips of the Clinton Conicals and see many many people associated with him who are found dead in mysterious circumstances, suspicious suicide, shot or killed in plane crashes.<br>  <br>  WATCH - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mnq5U9ovtaE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mnq5U9ovt...</a><br>  (Clinton chronicles)|`|f5wTQblsaa	There does seem to be more light aircraft crashing lately - one in the next village over make national headlines because it crashed onto two railway lines -  It could be that more people are taking flying lessons which seems to be the "in thing"|`|kvm9MWdZaa	I wonder if it is because of cost cutting resulting in  lack of maintenance or preparation. Just a thought in a rather cost conscious world.|`|52pZj3WFaa	I know what you mean!!<br>  <br>  And i don't think it is because they are just being reported - they would be anyway. <br>  Have you seen The Core? When the Earth loses its magnetism? ...Makes you wonder, doesn't it!|`|kMK9E2a7aa	There are lot less air crashes than there are road crashes. Many more people get killed on the roads, so bearing that in mind, why worry about plane crashes.|`|Gy5OV6CZaa	So many??? There's only been 3 major crashes in the last 6 months.|`|f3894cf56c171c2df84b7a30010ead74aa	Gravity?|`|f3fEYEYFaa	There have not been so many in comparison to 10 years ago or even 5 years.  What figures have you based your question on?  Dont be such a drama queen.... flying is still the safest method of transport.|`|mggll8dRaa	The U'.S. is reporting U.S. crashes.....!!|`|bxxwhP04aa	Things happen, often in bunches..........that's life.|`|3fd13a299603b3f5d603e1a660b1d1ecaa	I was thinking this earlier myself actually. <br>  Although there does appear to be more reportage of these 'incidents' in the press currently, it seems to me that these 'incidents' happen more often than we are led to believe, we just don't here about them. Worrying.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Just more media reporting such crashes..they happen all the time|`|wUebRxgOaa	probably because of the growing population of birds?!|`|AFkjkqcSaa	Exactly, especially whaen I go on hol in 2 weeks!!!
52pZj3WFaa	She deserves the blood sucking leeches.<br>  <br>  It takes one to know one.|`|TadINnYoaa	The brit public are a sad and emotionally bereft people.<br>  That was seen by the world during Princess Diana's leaving.<br>  UK is a very dumbed down society.<br>  They will mass follow anything others do.<br>  You see they do not know how to feel. You cannot attach human emotions to a 4wd a plasma tv or a bag of tesco products.<br>  If anyone is an easy easy bait for media and corporate whoredom it is the brits.|`|KFagjt8Jaa	not sure were your coming from with this one<br>  <br>  its not a game like the sims its real life jade is trying to get has much money for her family as she can and who can blame her.|`|AA11015890	Someone alert Skidoo - there's bound to be lots of Jade-bashing mileage in this latest news!|`|LwjOKhgyaa	it is gettin out of hand, think things outta slow down.|`|dAn9koABaa	i think they are heartless blood sucking ba????ds,no one on earth deserves what that poor woman is going through, but they will sell their papers and make lots of money out of all the sad buggers who buy the papers|`|nW3iJkT5aa	the public love it so the media provide what the public want.<br>  What a sick nation we have become
