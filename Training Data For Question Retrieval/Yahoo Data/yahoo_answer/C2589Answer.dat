If its max (which means absolutely nothing) then you might want a bigger amplifier.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	An 800w amp DOES NOT mean it puts out 800w all the time.<br>  <br>  It just has a max of 800w.<br>  <br>  It will be just fine.|`|daw140ceaa	If you connect two identical subwoofers to a single amplifier channel, the power produced will be divided evenly between the two subs.<br>  <br>  Make sure the combined impedance of the subwoofers matches the amplifier's 800-watt impedance rating.
AA10406285	Are you saying they just took off and did not wait for the police?<br>  If so, that is leaving the scene of an accident which is a chargeable offense. I imagine they may not have had insurance which is why they took off. Most likely however, the fault will still be considered yours due to the rear ending. Do your part and report the incident to your insurance co just in case the other party "surfaces" later. You need to cover yourself. Most likely they will not surface however and your company will just need to take care of the damage to your car if you want to put in a claim. If the damage is minor, you can tell your company you will handle the repair yourself.|`|XLXncQu9aa	This case could be "fraud".  You are right that there are some cases where the person that hit the other driver from behind is not at fault.  Most of the time it is the person who hit the other from behind who is at fault.  But in your case it sounds like the person in front stopped quickly on purpose.  There are cases where drivers do this to extort money.  So the fact that the other driver was "hesitant" about giving their information should tell you they are hiding something.  If you suspect anything is wrong in this particular case you can take this to court and give your side of the evidence.  Based on what you have said, I think its worth investigating.  As long as you know it wasn't your fault and you have evidence then go for it.  Just make sure to give good evidence.|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	Either the person's license was suspended or they had no insurance. I wouldn't worry about it too much.

Ak35Y562aa	The 94-08 v6 mustang have 4 Catalytic Converters.<br>  <br>  2 Pre-cats<br>  and 2 Normal cats<br>  <br>  You can USUALLY delete the pre-cats....IF .....IF the 2 normal cats are in excellent condition, and you SHOULD still pass emissions.<br>  <br>  I got my 2 pre-cats deleted, then replaced the 2 normal cats with High-Flows........i passed emissions the next day here in Maryland.<br>  <br>  I blew out my cats a few years later right before another emissions testing, so instead of getting High-cats this time, i bought some stock replacements from Autozone for like $130 or 200....i installed 2 of them, and PASSED again.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Problem is....since you live in the Commie-state of New York....they may inspect your car and notice that you dont have the Pre-Cats.....<br>  <br>  But i would delete them anyways, it will save you money since if you ever need to get those Pre-cats replaced, its going to be EXPENSIVE, since they are located way up next to the Exhaust Manifolds....its a REAL pain in the *** to replace them.<br>  <br>  <br>  Id yank the pre-cats out, replace them with pipe, keep the 2 normal cats.......if anyone says anything, just tell them you bought the car used....that way you wont get a fine.<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW: Removing the Pre-cats WONT make your car any louder...that's a myth.<br>  You REALLY only need 2 normal cats on the car, the pre-cats are just a pre-filter really....they actually dont make much of a difference in emissions read outs, since they are so small.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also make sure your EGR valve is in good condition, your not running rich, no blown head gaskets or intake gaskets....because they can cause an un-even Air to Fuel mixture ratios and trigger emissions failures.<br>  <br>  I BELIEVE maryland has the same emissions standards as new york....they are pretty strict.<br>  So if they are the same... you will DEFINATELY pass.....i did 3 or 4 seperate times.....once with a pre-blown head gasket.|`|lIxEKA1xaa	well first if u take them off it breaks the emmision laws and second you will throw an engine code cuz the second o2 sensors will be wack instead of being flat lined and good.|`|umuaX3MAaa	yea<br>  in new york it is noise pollution my dad got charged for it|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	You don't need to specify a specific state since it's illegal in all 50 states - and it's a federal law that carries a hefty fine.<br>  Definitely not worth the hassle - get a pair of hi-flow converters if exhaust back pressure is your concern.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	It is illegal, and a federal offense to remove emissions equipment from any vehicle that originally had emissions equipment.<br>  <br>  Even if you're outside emissions testing, even if the vehicle is now exempt.<br>  <br>  So yes, you must have cats.
huWmgztQaa	THere is no point to more than one subwoofer in a car or nearly anyware|`|ZnvUJxA8aa	If you are just wanting the sound of bass in your car, but do not want it overpowering, then only get one subwoofer. If you like the rumble in your chest, then get 2.<br>  <br>  There is no real specific radio that works better than another, but you will have to get a new one (assuming you still have a stock head unit). You need a new one because you need the rca hookups that are on the back of the new head unit. <br>  <br>  Common brands that are good and reliable are Alpine, Kicker, Rockford Fosgate, JBL, Jl audio, MTX audio, and Pioneer.<br>  <br>  If you get a new car, then yes you can always take them out and put them in the other car. Even if you dont get a new car, you can take them out if you please.<br>  <br>  I have not heard of any interference with HD radios, and whether u listen to pop/rock should not have any effect on if it will cause interference.|`|Tc2I7znMaa	For someone new to car audio I would recommend starting of simple. A single 12" subwoofer in it's own box would be enough to start you off and they are easy to take out if you ever wish to. Different radios don't exactly work "better" with subs, it is mainly how easy it is to wire them up. "Aftermarket" Head units that you can buy in any car audio shop are much easier to hook subs up to than OE (manufacturers) head-units.<br>  <br>  I can't really recommend you a brand as they all have their pro's and con's, what you should do is figure out a price range and go from there. Usually your local car audio shop will have a display board that has a variety of subwoofers on show, you need to find out what ones you like the look and sound of because everyone has their own opinion.<br>  <br>  Just remember that a subwoofer needs a dedicated amplifier to power it so you will have to factor in that cost as well. As for the interference with HD radios I'm not exactly sure what you mean by that, although I seriously doubt that a sub could interfere with radio reception I'll leave that to somebody else to answer.<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  <br>  Ben|`|APmKTd1Kaa	It really is personal preference, depends on your goals. One very stout subwoofer with enough power can easily out perform 2 or even 3 subwoofers that are entry level and cant handle much power. Also depends on your box. Simply using a ported box gives you a 3 decibel gain, that is equal to having another subwoofer and double the power, so then there is the issue of space. Most of your output is going to rely on the proper box. Size of the subwoofer is another aspect but not much. A lot of your choices rely on budget. Sub amps can go from $150 up to $1500 and Subwoofers from $50 on up to $1200. A custom optimal box will run you about $300. Let me know your budget and what type of vehicle (i.e. hatchback, van, suv, etc.) and the type of output you want (loud bass, sound quality, or scare everyone that gets in your car.)|`|s3W0GOR2aa	depends on how much you want to spend, and how loud you want it. i only have 1 15. some good brands to consider are RE audio,and Fi. yes you can take out your sub(s) and put them in a new car.|`|tLilNlptaa	All depends on your preference. Do you like just a little bit of bass, or lots. Thats the question you have to ask yourself.
aafTqjV1aa	I have a Yamaha XS1100 that I bought from a neighbor for $800. It was low mileage, but the color sucked. What I did was take off the painted areas (There aren't that many, usually some fairing parts, a couple of side panels and maybe a closeout around the back fender.) In my case everything else was chrome. I sanded down all the color parts so I could repaint them, ordered new insignia at the dealer, and sent the seat out for reupholstering. You can buy a small spray gun at Harbor Freight that will work fine for this small project. Maybe you can borrow a friend's portable air compressor if you don't have one. After all this, you need to decide what color to paint it. I chose bright yellow, because I wanted the bike to be visible. Car drivers are stupid enough as it is. I see black bikes with black chrome on them now. They must have a death wish. Paint it a color that stands out. To decide that, if you have an owner's manual that shows a side view of the motorcycle, go down and get it copied about 10 times. Then get some colored pencils or some art markers, and try  different colors. It's not perfect, as you only get 1 shade of blue 1 shade of red, 1 shade of yellow, etc<br>  but at least it will give you an idea.  When you finally decide, go down to a local store that supplies body shops, and pick out the paint. You can buy them in quantities as little as a quart. Paint is REALLY expensive, so this is good. You will also need solvent, possibly a catalyst, etc. The paint store will go through everything you need.<br>  Try painting some scrap stuff first, like an old garbage can. However, the one big difference between you and the body shops is, when you paint your parts, coat them about 5 times, as thick as you can  without runs, but if you get a run, don't even try to correct it.  I don't care how bad it looks at first. It may even get a bug in it. Don';t worry.Let everything dry. Then you get some 400 grit abrasive paper and water, and sand down everything you painted. Just to the point where any runs, etc. are removed. The surface should be uniformly dull and sanded. Now go to 600 grit paper and water and sand again. Then go to 1200 grit paper. Then use a buffer with some rubbing compound to bring out the gloss. Usually red is for heavy buffing, but it will leave everything smooth. Then you go to a white, fine rubbing compound, and buff it again. DON'T let any abrasive get on the next step's abrasive, or you will just be wasting time. Wash everything down with water between sandings and buffings and keep all the abrasives separate. Use different cloths, different buffing pads, etc.  When you get down to the white, fine compound, you will find the color coming out and the shine really increasing. You'll be surprised how nice it comes out. Let it dry overnight, then wax everything the next day, and put it back on the bike. (While you were waiting for the paint to dry, you should have been polishing the chrome parts so they look good.) Don't forget to put the medallions and insignia back on. The bike will look like it's brand new!<br>  Good Luck!|`|ghaETYwcaa	well to paint a bike proper you need to take it apart first, then you can paint the frame,tank, and fenders. and body work if its got any. so motor comes out,front end comes off,swing arm and rear wheel comes off.all the electrics off, this makes it easy to hang everything up and paint. A paint booth is easy to make with P.V.C. pipe and a tarp with an exhaust fan as well. And your paint ias only as good as your prep work! lots of sanding and priming.
QpP1xJ4Naa	Well, it should last a long time. You see Ford thought that Mazda made a mistake with the Miata by making it rear wheel drive. But Ford also saw that the small two seater sports car was a good idea. So Ford took the Mazda power train and put it into a FWD chassis.<br>  Well the Capri is as good as any thing Mazda put the 1600 engine into. But it will not be the joy to drive that a Miata is. Fun yes, a Miata - no.

TdrgZwnoaa	I have a 1968 BSA 441 Shooting Star. This is actually my second one. I learned to ride on a similar machine in the early 1970's. Ran the crap out of that one and my Mom sold it while I was away working over the Summer. <br>  <br>   I found the one I currently have quite a few years ago in the want ads. I wasn't even looking to buy a bike at the time but this one was mint and the seller was ''highly motivated''. I won't be riding it this Summer; the motor and transmission are being pulled in the Spring for a complete rebuild and the suspension needs to be attended to. Funds are little tight (new house) so the job has to be stretched out to next Winter.<br>  <br>   Right now it is parked in the living room with the artificial Xmas tree(no furniture either).

But I like a clean bike, I removed the hard bags and put on leather ones. Put custom bars and a seat on it. After years of riding with out one, I love the quick release wind shield. I have a large, passenger back rest for my wife. So the wind shield balances, the look out nicely. Fully loaded, with all our gear for camping and us on it. The bike weighs in, at about 1450 pounds.

Get in your car ASAP, lock the doors, and drive off. You're safe once your car is moving. And also never leave your doors unlocked. You wouldn't want someone to be hiding in your back seat.
v5fEfmO8aa	Yeah, it's just bolted on. But just like in the other comment, you will have to seal up the holes, water tight.|`|Oy9IYvBTaa	Yes you can but replace the screws that holds in to roof. Go to hardware store with one of your original bolts get a bolt no longer than 1/2 inch long or could go thru your headliner.

G5R8B0Wpaa	1.  The man was riding on the wrong side of the road.<br>  2.  The man failed to heed traffic control device.  Not a failure to yield because he was supposed to stop.  <br>  3.  The man refused medical treatment or police report right then,  but later said he had sought both.  <br>  <br>  In that the fellow was not complying with the law,  declined to protect all parties with police report at the time,  and later came back with unprovable claims of injury (how do you know the accident was responsble,  maybe he rode another mile and just fell over?),  I would most likely just ignore him or tell him to deal with your lawyer.   Just as if two cars collided,  the one running the stop sign would be at fault.|`|3qGdN6xMaa	Generally a bicycle should be following the same traffic regulations as a car or motorcycle would.<br>  <br>  It would have been better in the circumstances to get a police report because that would have shown that the man on the bicycle was at fault.<br>  <br>  Without this police report, the insurance could still fight it, but if the expenses he claims are minor they might choose to settle out of court and pay his expense to avoid paying for a trip to court.<br>  <br>  At least I'm assuming your mom is insured, and that she has contacted her insurance about this situation... if not the sooner the better, don't leave them out of the loop, they should get involved and have good advice on what to do.
BarjvQpTaa	if it is an older model, and you don't want to put the money into fixing it, it isn't very important. I would try to adjust it manually so it is slightly above center, this will give you a little more bow lift when you take off. Too much and it will jump, or "porpoise" like a dolphin. I ride a lot of P.W.C. in my occupation, and the only one i've really ever noticed a significant difference w/the trim is the sea-doo RX model. I hope this helps.|`|DrMDxlWMaa	If you wish to have top efficiency, it needs to be working. The trim on any vessel allows you to gain the highest level of efficiency from your vessel.

v8TWvtQgaa	Man, let me be very up front with you. Those high dollar fancy plugs gives NO, thats zero benifits over a std plug. <br>  <br>  I have dyno tested and track tested every plug known to man in the past 10 years. No gains in anything, in fact lost performance with a few brands <br>  <br>  Save your money and go with std. AC delco plugs. <br>  <br>  I drive a as some people calls it "street driven drag car" daily, I build performance engines. Everything leaves my shop with 1 of 3 brand plugs. AC delco, NGK V power, or autolite. Also same 3 types I use in my own cars <br>  <br>  Oh and those plustar plugs, yeah they are good and they do work, but you nor I even with my 505 HP engine would see a single gain. They are based off a NHRA top fuel hemi plug from about 10 years ago or so. They store elec energy to help fire the cyl on the next compression stroke. Ok cool, good, but our engines will burn the air/fuel mixture fully with a std ign. system and plug.  You'll see a gain only if you have 14:1 or more compression and run iut up to 8,000 rpm or more|`|zGzh1ylbaa	AC Delco's as with any GM. :-) They are very good spark plugs anyway.|`|5ITR6x6gaa	Go get regular  copper or platinum Autolite,there the best  there is .ive owned two corvettes,and autolites are better made  dont even have to set them they are gaped from the factory,thats why nascar uses them.|`|v5fEfmO8aa	I recommend the AC Delco plugs. I'm a firm believer in Standard parts.

I do suggest taking a pic or two to remember how the tension spring is installed!
ozwLZwXeaa	As the owner of a 92 Oldsmobile, I would go to WalMart and in the book and magazine section they sell manuals for under twenty bucks that will answer all your questions. You just need to know the year and style of your car and buy the appropriate book.  The starter is easy to find, start your car, raise the hood, look down beside the engine and the starter should be up close to the bottom of the engine and can be taken off by getting under the car, on a lift for safety, and it takes a good power wrench to back the bolts out.|`|3DmwSkdnaa	I think it should be near the bottom next to the flywheel|`|P7BfFo88aa	it should be on the side near the bottom.

Go back and tell them I think I might have hit your car.|`|ZOgcqaEIaa	Well, if you're caught it would be a hit and run, but if there is no video evidence, and no one saw it, you're probablly safe.  I would consider leaving insurance info and a phone number next time, they probablly wouldn't call, but at least they know you were decent enough to give the extra effort.|`|6beL9zycaa	Hmmmm... interesting.  OK.  Well, you should worry, at least for awhile.  Then, if nothing happens within... oh, 6 mos. I'd say you're in the clear.  But I wouldn't give up worrying until you hit the 6 mos. mark.  HOWEVER, if you have a conscience, (and at 19 I'm going to assume you don't, judging by the question itself) you need to worry about your own karma.  You know... "what goes around comes around?"  If it was a microscopic dent (and again, at 19 yrs old I'm almost certain it was) then I'd just hope that no one REALLY saw you, didn't get your license plate #, & call the cops or leave a note on the car with the info. (Unlikely)  So for now, I'd be cautiously optimistic. OR optimistically...nervous.  For a few months, put it to rest in 6.|`|va3Ysr8vaa	I think I and anybody would do the same thing, I wouldn't worry about it even if you get caught.  Any normal person would probably just drive away out of fear.  But if you get caught, most should be covered by insurance.|`|pYJ0I0cXaa	right thing is to contact owner, fess up, and pay the damages.

Yes.   You caused damage to someone else's property,  and need to own up to your negligence and make it right.  After all,  how would you feel if some scumbag damaged your wheels and ran?

p5azo6niaa	well there are many things to look for. rust on the fenders and floor pans are important. if the floors rotted it definitely needs replacing first. then i guess work on the body. you know sanding it and filling or hammering out dents.  then primer and paint. lastly if the motor needs rebuilt do the motor since its the most expensive part. it would suck to have a working motor but no car to put it in. thats the order we are restoring our 75 bug in. we're working on getting parts to rebuild the motor. its been a year and a half since we bought it, and theres about 1-2 months left before its drive-able. <br>  <br>  Just remember to take your time and do the job right. nothing is worse than a half-assed restoration job. especially on an air-cooled VW|`|EmgiGg17aa	Learn German?|`|vgUO4LwZaa	Purchase an old VW is the the first step. Hopefully ragtop.|`|tcUXitYJaa	for me its make sure the engine is goog to go as it is a daily driver for me also. if you are gonna just restore it then drive it i'd say make sure the pan isn't rusted out and needing replacment.
cAGv5evLaa	Depends on if you have an electric speedometer or a cable-speedometer. If it's a cable one, check the cable. But it sounds like you have an electric one, and there is a bad sensor or wire - start by checking your fuses and if they're okay then check the wiring. Replace the sensor if you have to.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	I'm guessing (you didn't tell us) that you have an analaog odometer where the numbers roll around.<br>  <br>  The gears in the cluster stripped.  Stop pushing that trip odometer resetbutton while you are moving.<br>  <br>  You have no speedometer cable to worry about and the VSS does NOT affect the odometer.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Check all your fuses in the box on left lower under the dash.|`|F1Qi7QzAaa	if speed sensor or cable is bad speedometer wont work.<br>  <br>  if fuse is blown, all gauges wont work.<br>  <br>  probably just dirt, mine stopped for a year in my last truck from sand|`|KmNLIxhAaa	i think if u hit enough bumbs in the car then the needle might have gotten loose and wont pick up but the odometer? no clue?|`|D1v5UIgRaa	Check the speed sensor or speedometer cable.

hoykolriaa	Had this problem before with Rovers - the aperature for the radio is quite restricted. <br>  <br>  It is is unlikely that your aftermarket radio is any longer than the original Rover radio.<br>  <br>  Check to see if your aftermarket radio has a bolt protruding from the rear - if it does - remove it - sometimes you'll need to open up the unit to access the nut from behind.<br>  <br>  All aftermarket radios have there own harness - and what will be happening is when your pushing in your new radio the harness is taking up too much space - especially with the attached ISO connectors.<br>  <br>  What I've often had to do is to remove panels from either side - such as the cubby - such that I can put my hand up from behind to crab the new harness to pull it back as the new radio is being pushed in.<br>  <br>  If the option is available and there is any railing or brackets that can be removed from beind the aperature - I would consider that option to make more space.<br>  <br>  hope this info helps
6en8QlaUaa	First of all congratulations on hiding the car for 7 months. That's impressive.<br>  <br>  The lender wants to get paid. That's the bottom line. You can however have a "reclaimed repossession" <br>  What this means is that the car was repossessed but you paid it off and got the car back.<br>  <br>  The only way to do this is to pay off the entire balance of the loan. <br>  Your options are to : <br>  1. Get an auto loan for the payoff balance and pay off the existing loan.<br>  2. pay off the entire balance in cash.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that you will have to pay off the entire balance as well as the "repo fees"<br>  <br>  A police officer can't take your car from you for late payments (It's a civil issue, not criminal)<br>  <br>  I recommend that you talk to the lender and explain that you want to pay off the entire balance, whether by loan or cash.<br>  If the car gets taken from you then the lender has to pay storage fees until it can go to auction. They will also likely get a lower price selling it than what you owe. They understand this and will happily take a payoff balance on the loan.|`|RWjvcCYoaa	You've been hiding a car from the repo man for 7 months? One thing almost everyone who gets a vehicle repo'd isn't aware of is that the local police are immediately notified of the repo order. This is done so that if you report your car stolen, they'll know right away that it was taken back by the finance company. They can also find a repo'd car by the license plate or VIN and call the tow company to pick it up, whether you're in it or not. <br>  <br>  The lender no longer will accept your payments because the repo order is in effect. It's a done deal. The vehicle will eventually be confiscated, sold at auction and you'll have to pay the balance of the loan if the auction price doesn't fully cover it.<br>  <br>  if the original lender was bought out by another lender, the repo order still stands. It continues on with the new company or bank. The order stays in good standing until they get their car back.<br>  <br>  BTW -- the repo is on your credit history already. That means no one will approve a car loan for you for the next 7 to 10 years, except maybe a buy here/pay here lot. But they'll charge you anywhere from 33% to 99.9% APR on a car that will break down quite often soon after you buy it. <br>  <br>  So it looks like cash will be the best way for you to go in buying another vehicle.<br>  <br>  In response to the other reply, a repo is a civil matter. The police don't confiscate your car. However, a cop can call an impound yard and have the car towed. That's been happening a lot today since repo's are at an all time high.<br>  <br>  And you cannot pay off the car now. Even if you get the total amount due. The repo order has gone through and they are under no obligation to accept your payment. And you can't force them to. Face the fact ... your car is gone, sooner or later. It sucks because you lost it due to a layoff. But that's the unfortunate truth.|`|VWWjL0txaa	I think your case is very critical and you can't write here all that happens, so you need to take advice from professional.

They have several.<br>  <br>  Alfa Romeo has been part of the Fiat group since 1986.|`|f940c9f37eaf72c4741509ed65b7eabdaa	Well, you haven't mentioned the car, but since you've mentioned the company, Alfa Romeo, I can tell you that the parent company of Alfa Romeo is Fiat.|`|FKKBJDTEaa	alfas parent company is fiat, but give us a car to work with please???|`|fWKO8vNQaa	There is nothing special about it. Its just a car.|`|KtQdOqHKaa	Erm, which car.  You have given us exactly 0 details to go on.  Provide us with some actual information or expect to get even stupider answers this.

5mCm2XTLaa	The coolant expand and contracts with the heat of the engine. You'll also notice that when the engines fully warmed up the radiator hoses are much firmer than when the engine is cold, that because of the pressure built up by this expansion. <br>  <br>  Many cars have high and low marks labeled FULL HOT and FULL COLD, some simply have HOT and COLD. It's normal.<br>  <br>  What you want to do is when the engine is COLD remove the cap and fill the bottle up to the LOW mark.<br>  <br>  Before the invention of the closed cooling system coolant used to just spill out through an overflow tube. You had to add coolant every week. The closed system also keeps air out which results in less corrosion.|`|v5fEfmO8aa	It's form the engine's thermostat when it opens it lets the maximum flow of coolant through, to help cool the motor down. This causes the level to go down. And when the thermostat closes it returns it back to the reservoir. So don't worry it's normal.
54ceb4afd91eb6d0c822b057cd3d44efaa	In Canada every pleasurecraft 10hp and above must be registered.  The old numbering system used 2 digits to designate the area of registration, a letter to indicate the province, followed by a registration number (ie:  60E12345).  New numbers are 2 letters to indicate the province followed by the registration number (ie: ON123456).  These numbers are to be afixed to both port and starboard bows, in a visible area, with letters no smaller Than 4".|`|wmBK9uASaa	Yes, every boat has a registration no that has to be displayed....My old narrowboat had a 5 digit no.....|`|RjUhISEIaa	Capt D's answer is the most correct but I would like to add that the hull identification number on power boats is in the gelcoat located on the transom.|`|p5IjD7tnaa	Hello<br>  <br>  They will have a registration number<br>  It will normally start with a 2 letter id as to the port it is registered in and a unique number, When at Marine Projects it was a 2 letter for Boat type<br>  ie PB could be a 36 foot Princess Cruiser then a 4 Digit number starting at 1 So you get a PB0004.

They are usually decals applied to both the port and starboard bows.<br>  If your speaking about Identification or Serial Numbers, yes. They are often on a metal plate attached to the inside of the stern or embossed on the outside of the transom on sailboats.<br>  By the way, if the boat, say a small one, has no motor, they usually don't need to be registered.|`|771aacf2f768bc76138476f792d8ae83aa	Mmerchant vessels have an International Maritime Organisation (IMO) number which is clearly displayed.

6en8QlaUaa	GET RID OF THE JETTA<br>  <br>  The Jettas have a horrible service history as your experience can attest to. If you have all these problems already then just kiss it goodbye.<br>  <br>  If your only two choices are these two cars then I would definitely get the 2001 Kia. <br>  <br>  The Jetta has no warranty that is why you have all those repair costs pending.<br>  <br>  The Kia on the other hand has a 10 year, 100,000 mile power train warranty (from the original in service date)<br>  <br>  Don't presume however that the Kia is the perfect car just because you are buying it from a dealer. <br>  Ask for a carfax report and try to get a mechanical inspection before you purchase the car. (It will cost you around $75-$100 more but will be well worth it)|`|b2444f35a7f9696e20acbb1687b47466aa	Go ahead and trade up 6 years. But make sure the dealer has some kind of warranty on it (sometimes they don't). <br>  <br>  You might also get an independent mechanic to look at it before you sign the deal.<br>  Just because it's from a dealership doesn't mean it's in A1 shape. <br>  ======================================...|`|WUA5xdI0aa	Get the Kia and treat yourself.<br>  The 1995 car is getting on a bit now. I swapped a 94 for an 01 and loved all the extra kit.
cAGv5evLaa	The cost to fix this problem depends on where the problem started. <br>  If the belt went out, that's a cheap fix - less than $10.<br>  If the pump died, that's a bit more pricey - you'll need a mechanic to replace it unless you're handy with a wrench, and the cost will be that of a new pump plus an hour or two of labor (depending on where you take the car, that could be $120 worth of labor cost right there, plus the cost of the pump - you might try making friends with someone who can do it for you for cheaper). <br>  It could also be the power steering piston - cheaper than a pump, but still has an hour of labor costs, perhaps total of $150-200 for that fix at a mechanic. <br>  <br>  If it's making a whiny/moaning sound that gets louder when you turn the wheel, that's your pump telling you it's out of fluid. Check the fluid and fill if it's empty, and try to find if there's a leak - could be leaking from the hydraulic piston under the car, or from one of the PS hoses, or it could be leaking from the pump itself.<br>  If it's not making any strange sounds, it's probably a dead pump. Could also be a broken belt (although not likely since the PS belt probably runs one or two other components under the hood like your water pump, and you'd be in bigger trouble if it broke).<br>  <br>  The more you know about this problem, the less likely you are to be ripped off by a mechanic. Go in there with a list of technically-specific things you think could be causing the problem and let him know you know what you're talking about - that way he won't be as tempted to take you for a ride. Always be on guard, you will save hundreds of dollars that way.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	If you already checked under the hood and the power steering fluid is full then you may need a new pump and I would call a salvage yard or junk yard in your area. They take apart all crashed cars and sell the good parts way cheaper than auto zone or anywhere.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Pump.  Rack. Hoses. PS Cooler (if it has one). PS Belt.<br>  <br>  Any or all could be the problem.  no way to know a price without looking at it and knowing what is wrong.

Check your insurance rates before buying one, for example here - autoinsurance.noneto.com|`|ySwUwZqCaa	If you got the money go for it.

Cars shouldn't be your priority when you are in school.
cAGv5evLaa	Sounds like a wiring problem to me - there might be a loose wire (ground) somewhere. If the alternator was bad you would KNOW it for sure - the engine would die quickly after starting because the battery would supply spark and would not be getting charged by the alt.<br>  The fluctuation of the voltage on the battery is probably normal. In my experience, digital mutlimeters show fluctuation on almost any circuit, even if it's DC.<br>  Check your wiring, relays, even fuse box. If the car is an older model, it's possible that one of the smaller wires could be going out|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	If you had a diode that failed (open circuit) the alternator would only charge for 2/3 of a revolution.  Does it seem like that might be the case?<br>  <br>  You didn't mention the frequency of the flickering.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Battery light on the dash on?<br>  <br>  I would suspect you have a loose connection somewhere on the main lighting circuit somewhere that is moving when the engine is running, but without performing a real load test on the alternator I am just guessing.|`|PkzPIHciaa	anywhere above 12v is good,its charging.<br>  Sounds to me that you have a bad connection or the globe is going to blow,maybe try a different globe.<br>  If it was over charging it would either blow the globe or a fuse or blow something way before the interior light.|`|F1Qi7QzAaa	sounds like a bad ground.<br>  <br>  if the lights dim when they flicker = bad ground<br>  <br>  if they get brighter - surge of amps.

b75427b8123ccfcf5f8c87fc21a99672aa	A missile lock means that the guidance system for a missile can accurately track a target, and a fire-control system can calculate the required flightpath for the missile to hit the target. The "lock" is a function of the tracking system of the fighter or the missile's seekers.<br>  <br>  Usually the pilot selects a missile and its guidance system attempts to electronically track the selected target. Upon a lock, it indicates the same to the pilot either aurally or graphically and the pilot releases the missile when best suited.<br>  <br>  The common air-to-air tracking are infrared, active/passive radar and anti-radiation.<br>  ------------ ---------------- -------------------- ------------------ --------------- --------------<br>  Edit: The seeker for the IR missile needs to be activated first, so technically the pilot "presses a button" to attempt the lock. And there could be multiple targets, in which case the pilot has to select the required target. For a within visual range missile, the missile's seeker detects and locks the target.<br>  <br>  Edit 2: The pilot could "see" the target visually, on the radar (if active), on the Infrared (if available) and over a shared radar network (if available). In all cases, the fire control system has features that allows the "seeing" device to select the target and transfer that data to the Infra Red missile so that it can lock on. For example, in certain aircrafts the missiles seeker is slaved to the helmet mounted display.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	The missile system uses IR or Laser to lock onto its target and then notifies the pilot that it is locked.  Once locked, the pilot can deploy the missile.  On the new F-22 he can lock on multiple targets at once and choose his targets.<br>  <br>  Once the missile is launched, it has its own onboard control and targeting systems to find the target and the pilot is free to move on to his next target.|`|GK5gL307aa	the pilot has to set his radar scan range and such, and it will pick up the targets, depending on the plane. the pilot then chooses the target (by more or less pushing a button) and arms the missile and fires it.

After the car sits in impound for 30 days and has a clear title they put a lien on it and end up selling the car at auction to cover the cost of towing and storage. <br>  <br>  It's a dirty business and on occasion people have been busted for corruption on account some towing services and city officials got a little bit too aggressive in the seizure of vehicles.

b2444f35a7f9696e20acbb1687b47466aa	The headlights ran the battery down.  <br>  If everything else was working OK before that, it shouldn't have affected anything else. <br>  <br>  You can take it (just the battery, not the whole car) to an auto service place or most auto supply stores (like Auto-Zone) and get it charged back up for just a few dollars, (probably less than 10), and take a couple of hours. <br>  <br>  If you already put a different battery in, and it makes the lights come on, but doesn't try to make the engine start, the first thing I'd try is to make sure that the battery connections (the ends of the cable where it bolts onto the battery posts) are CLEAN and TIGHT, and on the correct posts.<br>  If that doesn't help, then are you sure that the second battery is fully charged?  Sometimes the battery can have enough charge to make the lights come on, but not enough to turn the engine. <br>  <br>  Have you tried using jumper cables? <br>  NOTE: Be sure to attach jumper cables positive to positive, and negative to negative. <br>  Good Luck<br>  ======================================...|`|rocQqDxYaa	try jumping ? you sure the batt. u tried to use was the right kind for the car or wasnt dead itself ? <br>  the only thing else i can think of is groundwires not being in tact or the alternator .. and part that i forgot the name of lol <br>  im no mechanic . sorry ! good luck tho .
KsMLHzbzaa	alot of 10mm bolts. I also believe 17mm bolts are used quite often also.<br>  any set of tools will work for normal repairs. Other repairs, such as clutch, timing, changing the trans oil, etc. need special tools. you can find alot of these tools at pelicanparts.com. 944s are great. Just keep your timing in check. get the tension checked every 5k miles or once a year.
FXICH5dCaa	I agree with Mindworm regarding:<br>  Helicopter pilots likely appreciating nav/comm at their left.<br>  Additional reasons for right cockpit seating of captain:<br>  Having the engine power levers, fuel control levers, and emergency fire extinguishing T handles to the left could be advantageous. <br>  In the case of an S76C+ where an engine computer has failed, that same left hand could be used to control the engine with the failed computer via the engine power control lever back up cable. (a C++ has a back up engine "beep" switch on the collective)<br>  In the unlikely case of an engine fire the T handle(s) could be actuated with the left hand isolating the effected engine(s). <br>  In the case where an auto flight system failure is experienced the collective trim can be used while making nav/com selections as well as performing other duties (above) with the right hand covering the cyclic for directional control.<br>  I am not sure what aircraft has sliding doors where there is not enough room for radios and control panels that Mindworm mentioned.<br>  Also regarding loss of tail rotor comment:<br>  Loss of tail rotor CONTROL should always be a considered as well. Said loss may result from cable failure, loss of second stage hyd. sys. pump, fluid, or press. <br>  In such a case the S76 mentioned by Islander the tail rotor's self centering cam would automatically drive the TR to -2 deg pitch which would allow for normal fwd flight with airspeed > 65 kts. A running landing would then be necessary. <br>  Hope this helped, have a nice day :)|`|AH98UdLmaa	To fly a helicopter you need to use your left hand to control the "collective" pitch while your right hand controls the "cyclic" pitch. You need to maintain cyclic pitch control at all times to keep the helicopter stable.  The collective pitch control needs to be monitored.  The pilot sits in the right seat so that he can use his left hand to tune the nav and com radios and or adjust flight Instruments such as the  altimeter or what ever during flight all while maintaining positive control of the cyclic control in flight.  I have flown both a Bell 47 where the pilot sits on the left side and a Bell Jet Ranger where the pilot sits on the right side and it is much easier flying a helicopter single pilot sitting on the right hand side.|`|AA10721549	don't forget russian helicopters having the setup opposite.<br>  Though i believe the reason for placing the captain to the right is due to hands disposition -<br>  <br>  while the airplane (read airLINE - the sport airplanes do often have two throtle lever for a single pilot) pilots usually steer with their left hand and right is reserved for controlling the throttle levers, helicopter pilots steer using RIGHT hand and left is reserved for collective control INEVITABLY (there is not one single helicopter with collective control placed right of the seat.).<br>  <br>  Because of this, the helicopter pilots are more likely to appreciate having most of the nav/comm at their left. if in the left there are sliding doors, there is not enough room for radios and control panels<br>  <br>  <br>  Charlie got it wrong. you can NEVER ever see the tail rotor from whichever pilot seat. it's flight engineer's duty to check out the tail rotor area. <br>  Mike if you lost power, the helicopter is not rotating anyhow, it just loses RPM of main rotor and drops. th nose only jumps some 10 to 30 degrees to either side.<br>  <br>  Apart from that, IF tail rotor shaft gets torn, the most useful thing to do is to shut down the engines (=stop rotation) and autorotate, because you don't need the tail rotor anymore, then. <br>  /including the famous blackhawk down scene. if the helicopter turns 60 degrees per second  it is no longer a controlled crash, it's jsut an illusion of one. Thus, when tail rotor is lost, shut down the engines and autorotate/<br>  <br>  re: sessy> could not agree more, most mature helicopters would setup certain tail rotor pitch whenever control /not power transmission/ to the tail rotor is lost, which usually provides certain ammount of power to counter the torque at typical flight regime. still, there is nno need of having a clear view onto the crashsite, since the helicopter is normally flying or skiding forwards and is capable of controlled forward flight and airplane langding.|`|G5zN12dbaa	Because if the helicopter lost power and had to go into auto-rotate, the body of the chopper would spin clockwise. If the pilot is in the right seat he can see where he is going to do a controlled crash!!!

Damage was done to your car, damage that you need to repair.  Having said that, it probably will cost you less in the long run to just pay out of pocket to replace it than it will to file through your insurance.  The mirror replacement will probably be less than your deductible, and even if it is a little more, the hike in your car insurance rate once you file a claim will probably cost you more than the mirror itself.  <br>  <br>  Your first move:  Go to a reputable repair shop and get an estimate. <br>  <br>  Next move:  Check your insurance papers to see what your deductible is.<br>  <br>  After that:  Compare the two.  Unless you have some kind of amazing high tech mirror that is very complex, like you will find in the highest tech luxury cars, the likelihood is that just replacing the mirror is less than your deductible, or not much more.  If that is the case, then I advise you to pay out of pocket to avoid hiking your insurance rate.

lHLDvVALaa	Here's a combination of two answers I've given here before recently, which I believe answer your question well<br>  <br>  In response to a question with the same title as yours:<br>  <br>  "I'm a 21 year old college student, and I have an '04 LS V8.<br>  <br>  If it tells you anything, I get compliments from people my age all the time about how much they like my car, even from BMW, Mercedes, and Audi drivers, who are plentiful around my school. Someone else at my school has an LS also, an '00.<br>  <br>  The LS isn't a stereotypical Lincoln. My Dad has a Continental(two of them, actually) and my mom has a Towncar. Both the Towncar and the Continental have big, soft cushy seats and an equally soft, cushy ride. You don't feel potholes and bumps in either of those cars-they're big, smooth cruising cars.<br>  <br>  The LS is a totally different experience. The suspension is designed to hug the road well, but as a consequence doesn't soak up the bumps as well-you'll feel them in seat of your pants. The seats are lean and trim-to keep you well planted around curves, but not make you feel like you're sitting on your living room couch. The steering is tight and responsive-not overly assisted and loose. When you step on the accelerator, it moves.<br>  <br>  In short, the LS drives more like a BMW than a Lincoln. You won't go wrong getting one."<br>  <br>  And, in response to "Is the Lincoln LS good in the snow"<br>  <br>  "In my experience, no it's not.<br>  <br>  It does alright once it gets going, but is very difficult to get going. That's even with the Advance-trac(which is supposed to be a step above standard traction control) on and forcing a third gear start, which the select-shift transmission will let you do.<br>  <br>  Of course, a good set of snow tires would probably make all the difference, however that's not really a viable option for me-we are known to have a week of 70 degree weather sandwiched between two separate big snow storms."<br>  <br>  So, in short-if you like the car, get it. My Grandmother can't stand riding in or driving my LS, if it tells you anything-she feels like it has too much power and rides too rough.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Wow, where to start<br>  <br>  "These had experimental engines and don't last past 100,000 miles."<br>  <br>  I'm curious where the 100,000 mile figure came from. It surely can't come from actual experience, considering that I know of plenty which have well over 100,000, and some close to 200,000, without any engine work beyond oil changes, spark plugs, and coils. I've never heard of serious engine problems at anywhere close to 100,000 miles. <br>  <br>  There's nothing "experimental" about the engine-Land Rover and Jaguar had been using it for a long time before the LS or TBird either one came on the scene. They're still using the same basic design today-Ford doesn't use it anymore since Jaguar and Land Rover are no longer part of the Ford lineup. <br>  <br>  "The interior is worse than the previous generation of Lincoln (Continental and Mark VIII)."<br>  <br>  No, it's not as plush at the Continental or Mark VIII(my dad has 2 Continentals, so I'm very familiar with them, and have driven a Mark VIII). I certainly wouldn't call it "worse" though. <br>  <br>  The seats are lean and trim-they're designed to hold you tight, not make you think that you're sitting in your living room. They're quite comfortable, just not overly padded. They're not unlike what you'd find in a BMW or Porsche.  <br>  <br>  Overall fit and finish, as well a quality of materials, is very consistent with every other Lincoln for the past several years. Yes, there's plastiwood(unless you get the sport version, which has aluminum trim), but then the Continental, Towncar, and Mark VII all have their fair share of plastiwood also. <br>  <br>  The seat heaters are better than those on the Continental, and the seat coolers(available on '03 and later models) are superb. <br>  <br>   "I am prejudiced due to the fact that I drive Mark VIII's. They are more dependable, cost less to fix or buy,"<br>  <br>  The 4.6L modular V8 is about bulletproof, so I'll give you that. Don't forget that the Mark VIII has air suspension, though(not present on the LS) which can cost more to repair than the car is worth if it goes out. <br>  <br>  "have more horsepower,"<br>  The '93 to '94 Mark VIII engine makes 280 hp and 285 ft-lb of torque. The later ones made 290 hp and 295 ft-lb of torque. The '03 and later LS V8 engine 280 hp and 286 ft-lb of torque. <br>  <br>  Given the fact that the LS weighs about 100 lbs less, and has a more aggressive rear axle(3.58:1 vs. 3.27), the small power gain that the Mark VIII is pretty much negated. Published specifications show that the LS tops the Mark VIII in every way. <br>  <br>  Let's also not forget that the LS has a 5-speed transmission vs. the 4 speed on the Mark VIII, so it's better able to use the power available from the engine. Plus, all V8s and some V6s have the selective shift transmission, that lets you shift to your preference. <br>  <br>  "a sleeker design" <br>  <br>  I've always thought that the Mark VIII looked rather bloated, and have never particularly cared for it. <br>  <br>  The LS looks totally different, and I prefer its appearance by a long shot over the Mark VIII. <br>  <br>  Bottom line, is, though, this is a personal preference. <br>  <br>  "It IS a piece of crap."<br>  <br>  Not by a long shot, and I think that anyone who says so simply doesn't know what they're talking about.|`|9dvmMRX4aa	It's absolute CRAP in snow and it is a 100% Granny car|`|NqPQSM0Raa	In answer to your question, no, it's not a granny car.

Stunters do it all the time.<br>  Breaking out of it? - Don't ask.<br>  You can 'push', or even sometimes break out of, the envelope <br>  without harm. it's like driving too fast for conditions. <br>  If everything goes right, you might get away with it in some, even <br>  most  instances. In others, you're toast.<br>  Most of us deliberately broke 'out of the envelope' in stall training.<br>  "See? The wing stops flying! How about that."|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	It all depends on the aircraft and on the way in which the envelope is pushed.  There aren't a lot of things that a pilot can do outside the envelope of a 747 that will harm him (as long as he doesn't damage the plane or crash), but if he's flying a jet fighter or an aerobatic plane he can get into a heap of trouble quite quickly by moving outside the envelope (and indeed, in some cases he can get in trouble while still in the envelope).|`|JeUvm9NIaa	Depends on the aircraft and the pilot's limits. <br>  What is normal for a Extra 300 would be structual failure in a c-172.<br>  An extra an handles +/- 9g's way more than almost all pilots can tolerate, so any maneuvers would be more than likly in this flight enveolpe, the the pilot will blackout/redout.  If they tried very high g' maneuvers in a c-172, the wings could shear off and crash. <br>  All aircraft have a saftey factor built in, where as the aircraft can with stand 150% of the load factor limts before structual failure.|`|0dBeMSsyaa	Depends which way you are referring to pushing the envelope as well as by how much. Most likely during G maneuvers the pilot will black out or red out before aircraft damage occurs. As for the plane's envelope, it will most likely disintegrate from structural stress (over speed, g-overload)|`|nRCqF6Euaa	The aircraft accidents and incidents section of ' YOUTUBE '

BGPa2DqYaa	You didn't say what state your in. In this state and many others we have a form generated by the States department of finance. Some States just call It the tax bureau. In any event the form is in NY a DTF803 It has lines that ascribe what where and when. For instance if you "Purchased the vehicle" Even for $1.00 you would put that down. Now, on the reverse side of this form is the "Gift" side. Now it depends on the year of the vehicle as well as the kelly blue book value.If your talking about a relatively new car 2007-08 & 09 your asking for trouble. Most DMV offices will NOT give you a problem but will put or mark your form for "Audit" now, the problems begin. If and I'm sure you are, legitimate, then nothing but the aggravation to worry about. Here in NY they long for a chance to flex there wings so to speak. You'd be better off going to the DMV at the same time. The most that could happen is the tax. Fair market value.Again,according to the "Kelly Blue Book" Then that figure times your states tax rate. Like I said,they probably WON'T say a thing to you. I know here they are told not to. No confrontations. Just check the Audit box and let you go. DMV workers (Clerks) are NOT tax auditors. Good Luck
Sa27DigUaa	Depending on how big your family is...<br>  <br>  Either of the Q models for overall space and comfort.<br>  <br>  The A4 Avant with the I4 2.0 TFSI is going to give the best mileage for that class vehicle, but the A6 also offers an Avant, just not as good gas mileage and much more power.<br>  <br>  As far as safety, all Audi models have good ratings but the new Q7 is suppose to be the cat's meow as far as the 2009 models go.<br>  <br>  The only way to know for sure is to take your entire family to the dealership and test drive the models you like with family in tote.

32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	The high-pressure turbines of a jet engine represent some of the most advanced technology in the world.  Engineers are constantly looking for new and better materials that can withstand higher and higher temperatures without losing their tremendous strength.  The reason for this is that the higher the temperature at which the turbine runs, the more efficient it becomes from an energy standpoint.  The endurance of the materials in the high-pressure turbines of a jet engine is one of the major limiting factors on engine performance, reliability, robustness, and economy.<br>  <br>  This being so, most turbines are made of special superalloys of a dozen different elements or so, and are fabricated under extraordinarily precise conditions so that the macro- and microstructure of the blades follows a very specific pattern that maximizes desirable characteristics. The blades contain blobs of one superalloy immersed in another alloy, cooked up from exotic blends of metals such as titanium, tungsten, tantalum, chromium, and rhenium.<br>  <br>  Many of the most important advances in jet engine design are a direct consequence of improvements to turbines that allow operation at ever-increasing temperatures.  The hottest parts of modern jets are up to nearly 500° F hotter than they were half a century ago, and engine performance and economy have dramatically improved as a result.<br>  <br>  Eventually ceramics and ceramic composites will probably be used for turbine blades, but right now there are still technical obstacles to be overcome before they can be used.<br>  <br>  For materials engineers, jet engines prevent some of the most interesting challenges around.  And even generally speaking, the engineering of jet engines is extremely state of the art, the absolute leading edge.|`|fCOq04lNaa	Usually most of the parts within an engine are made of titanium. The nacelles(the covering) are usually aluminum or carbon fiber composite, and same for the pylons.|`|e72f3f4292a7415fd145cc8cd59ea47baa	Suffice to say turbine alloy

We associate that via conditioning with "sexy"-"badass" whatever term you wish-due to the perceived glamor of fighters and their crews, plus the attraction of aviation.|`|Xnod6v5Vaa	In my opinion, the only "sexy" plane is the Locheed Martin F/A-22 Raptor. Although some planes may look sexy, they are originally designed for functionality, aerodynamics, and maneuverability; however some planes such as the Fairchild Republic A-10A Warthog are designed to take hits (which is why the rudders look like they guard the engines-they do) <br>  There is a real saying that says "If it looks good, it probably flies good." Although this is not what manufacturers strive for, they do keep it in mind. <br>  <br>  I think it's a conscious coincidence.

The F-16 is far superior to the F-4, and the F-5 is very close to the F-16, but even though it performed excellently with a commando squadron in Vietnam, they just didnt like the idea and didnt buy any. They simply liked the F-4, just like they liked big cars. Small was wimpy in the 60s. <br>  The F-16 came about because generals liked it, it wasnt needed, but they had a place in their heart for it. It looked sexy, it was named after the academy mascot (obvious brown nosing), but the pilots wanted nothing to do with it. It took years for pilots to warm to the F-16. They wanted to fly F-15s. <br>  So looks dont really effect the design, but they do effect which design gets selected for production.|`|4bGQpFB3aa	There's an old saying if they look good they probably fly good (with the exception of McDonnel-Douglas products which prove if you put enough horsepower on a barn door it will fly); see the Viper, Spitfire, Mustang, Boeing P-12 and SPAD.<br>  <br>  Dogzilla -- suggest you rethink what you may have heard from the Eagle Mafia.  The Viper was needed, as Eagles were designed "not a pound for air-to-ground", somebody had to do the interdiction mission.  When Boyd and the team came up with the light weight, cheap fighter it was Day, VFR only.  Only mission creep made the F-16 the BAI god it is today.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Coincidence, and aerodynamics.|`|9sRH0Bjtaa	its total coincidence. even if companies try to make it a beauty most of the looks come into the aerodynamics and maneuverability. its mainly the shape that make the plane fast and easy to use. it would not be possible to do moves that fighter jets do with a shape of a 737. could a smaller version of a 737 go straight up? no but the shapes help the fighter plane to easily go through it. Its also the equipment. they are designed to specifically hit the target 100% of the times. the have to be situated so that when it comes into service engineers can access it very easily. and the pilots don't need to concentrate on the flying so much, so the can concentrate on the fighting, and the shape of the plane help this a lot.|`|Tiph3lQcaa	The design process in aerospace engineering tends to be intense. It usually involves lots of long hours, weekends, and coffee. Tradeoffs are made on a daily basis between different disciplines like aerodynamics, structures, materials, electronics, performance, propulsion, cost, and weight. Design reviews often occur early in the morning, so decisions can be worked on through the day/evening and initial results provided the following morning. I can just imagine some guy standing up in one of those meetings to suggest that the shape of an engine inlet be altered to make the aircraft appear more threatening. <br>  <br>  Dead silence fills the room. Career guidance is about to occur.|`|fL9xGKZaaa	the aircraft are designed for utility generally not visual appeal. although on instance if when the F-117 was under development it was originally supposed to have a colorful, swirly, pastel paint job, but the commanding general of the project said he didn't wan his pilots fly sissy looking airplanes so they were painted black. contrary to popular belief the radar absorbent paint doesn't have to be black|`|fBq6gCuAaa	It is a coincidence.

In my opinion they are very over-priced. I have not heard any complaints about reliability, but I only know two folks personally that own an American Iron Horse. They are beautiful bikes though. It was also my understanding that the company was in pretty bad financial shape if that matters at all.

You could trace the wiring going into the instrument assembly and see if you find any damage. If the problem isn't external, it's internal and the dealership needs to have a look.
J0Ie3XJmaa	Usually when you drive, there are not too many places where you go everyday, so it is not hard to remember how to get where.

ae530cfc7c3f9fd6506b72dc76a8d126aa	First of all, the Good Doctor did exactly what he was asked to do by the Government of the day: identify the loss-making lines and close them. What was ill-conceived was the remit from the Government - for that you can not blame the Good Doctor.<br>  <br>  Probably the most ill-judged closure was the Dumfries to Stranraer line. In its wake, there has been a huge increase in traffic along roads and through towns that were never designed for it. The amount spent on road improvements could have kept the railway open for a millenium. Furthermore, rail passengers from Stranraer to the South are now left with a rail journey as far north as Kilmarnock, or even Glasgow, before coming south!|`|AA12145054	Corby Railway Station - recently salvaged from the Beeching axe is  great success, owned by Network Rail and managed by East Midlands Trains. It serves the town of Corby in Northamptonshire, England. The current station, opened on 23 February 2009, replaces the original closed in 1966 which was briefly reopened in 1987, only to close again in 1990.|`|FWOdlpx8aa	What about the east coast line from Teeside down to Whitby and Scarborough....|`|CGr6EtRUaa	The Great Central - the last main line to be built in the UK and the first to be closed - and the Waverley Route (Edinburgh-Carlisle).<br>  <br>  And many others. Also Dr Beeching closed down many intermediate stations on existing routes. E.g. Bath - Chippenham: Bathampton, Bathford, Box and Corsham all closed.<br>  <br>  And of course, the Somerset & Dorset. Common sense should have said that this heavily-used cross-country line, which provided a route from the Midlands to the South Coast avoiding London, should have been kept open.<br>  <br>  Alas, no.|`|arrYbslraa	What most people forget is that the proposed closures were actually far more drastic than what was actually implemented.  I seem to recall that Beeching originally proposed the total closure of all lines North of Inverness and West of Plymouth for example.<br>  There are numerous lines that were closed because of lack of traffic/duplication of route, but which subsequently have become needed.  The old GWR route through Birmingham Snow Hill to Wolverhampton is one, New Street - Wolves is at absolutely maximum capacity most of the day with no easy option for expansion.  Development of the Scottish borders has seen the Waverley route begin to rise from the ashes, and the Port Road should never have closed, the Carlisle-Stranraer road has been a major trunk route for a long time.|`|ca64f074806522d41931e7a2676ce936aa	A couple were identified in a recent series of BBC TV programmes, which looked at travelling times then and commuting times now. They were Marple to Stockport (it was quicker to walk than use the car) and Portbury to Bristol. Other routes I would suggest were the North Cornwall line and branches to places like Ilfracombe and Bideford(again the BBC recently showed a TV programme identifying what a horror Padstow is) and the Waverley route - part of which is now being rebuilt by the Scots. Other, less well known lines would include those parts of the old Blyth and Tyne serving the large conurbations of South East Nortumberland. Finally, in agreeing with the Great Central and Ruabon to Barmouth Junction, the other notable cross country route that was needlessly lost was the Somerset and Dorset.<br>  <br>  Later edit. I agree with the comment about stubs - this was a total nonsense. The Uckfield - Lewes line is a prime example. How much would it have cost to keep that open and provide a much needed (today) alternative to the main London - Brighton line.Paths are so much in demand that when the Gatwick Express service was extended to Brighton in December last, Brighton - Watford (now Milton Keynes) trains had to be cut back to East Croydon. Also, in the south, the closure of the Horsham/Christ's Hospital - Guildford line was very shortsighted, leaving the large dormitory town of Cranleigh off the railway map (this, incidentally was the only line in Surrey to be 'Beechinged')<br>  <br>  I also agree that to some extent blame should not be laid at the feet of Dr Beeching, but at the Government of the day. Don't forget that in 1964 (in the midst of the cuts) a Labour Government came to power, promising to halt further cuts, a promise that was speedily reneged on. However, the Doctor is to be blamed for the poor methodology used. Counting passengers at non peak times, for example and taking each line in isolation, rather than calculating its benefit to the network as a whole. It is, IMO, a fine example of putting someone in charge of an organisation who has no idea of the industry. We are seeing something very similar today with the revelation that Terry Wogan has more banking qualifications (as a one time back cashier) than all the highly paid 'non-executive' directors of the banks that are costing the taxpayers a fortune in bail outs due to stupid decisions taken by those individuals. 'When will they ever learn....'.|`|TwIIkYZGaa	Beeching removed several stretches of line which created "stubs."<br>  <br>  Redditch to Evesham, Stratford UA to Honeybourne, Carmarthen to Aberystwyth, Uckfield to Lewes, Oakhampton to Tavistock.<br>  <br>  Reinstating these short stretches of line (relatively cheap) would link up the stub with the rest of the network, strengthening the railway.<br>  <br>  As well as this, many holiday resorts had their links cut away (because the survey was done outside of the Summer holidays). Places like Padstow, Bude and Lyme Regis now all have traffic problems (esp in the summer!). These were all on short(ish) branches which could be re-opened.|`|b718fa2d9a8d00357a3f45f873ceaa0eaa	Definitely the Great Central line for me.<br>  It was still used by passengers right up to the day it closed and was still making money,it was only closed because there were see to be other lines that the journeys could be taken on.<br>   <br>  But as a close second it would have to be the Oxford to Cambridge line.<br>  Most of it is still there but with no passenger service.<br>  <br>  A local line to me which should never have been closed would be the Glazebrook to Timperly line.<br>  <br>  With a junction reinstated facing Manchester direction Container trains could avoid running through Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Oxford road thereby freeing up paths on the busiest two line railway in the UK.|`|m2u4UH1vaa	isnt it amazing how people remember the name of the person commissioned by the government to do this, but not tht it was the conservative government that ordered his report and implemented it? Anyway, how about the lines in south wales that were axed and in recent years reopened, and in succesful use? Or the line from fareham to gosport in hampshire where gosport is now the largest town in the uk not connected to the railway network at all.

TCINOEX1aa	BMW 650 vs. Mercedes-Benz SL-Class Review<br>  Utility<br>  The 6 Series's more sizeable trunk will accommodate more big objects than the Mercedes-Benz SL-Class. Drivers with frequent child-duty might favor the BMW over the Mercedes-Benz SL-Class. <br>  <br>  Performance<br>  With that kind of horsepower, both the 6 Series and the Mercedes-Benz are veritable speedsters. With respect to horsepower, the Mercedes-Benz SL-Class packs quite a wallop and will knock the BMW down a few rungs. On the other hand, note that high horsepower engines often command higher insurance premiums. <br>  <br>  Dimensions<br>  The Mercedes-Benz SL-Class is somewhat heavier than the BMW 6 Series. The Mercedes-Benz SL-Class and the BMW 6 Series compete for the same parking spaces. The Mercedes-Benz SL-Class's shorter wheelbase will likely give a nimbler feel in daily traffic. On the other hand, the BMW 6 Series is likely to have a smoother, more stable ride. <br>  <br>  Cost<br>  The destination charge is a standard charge for transporting the vehicle from its point of origin to the dealer. It costs about the same to get the BMW 6 Series to the dealership as the Mercedes-Benz SL-Class. The Mercedes-Benz SL-Class pales in comparison to the BMW 6 Series in terms of gas mileage. Regarding gas mileage, the BMW 6 Series beats the Mercedes-Benz SL-Class. The Mercedes-Benz SL-Class is tremendously more expensive than the BMW 6 Series in terms of MSRP. The BMW will save you a bunch of money at the pump every year compared to the SL-Class. <br>  <br>  Handling<br>  The Mercedes-Benz SL-Class has quite a bit wider tires than the BMW 6 Series. Keep in mind that bigger tires might look and feel better, while narrower tires may provide better handling in deep snow. <br>  <br>  Drivetrain<br>  The SL-Class's engine is quite a bit bigger than the BMW 6 Series's. Note that more massive engines may use more gasoline than smaller ones. The Mercedes-Benz SL-Class packs quite a wallop compared to the BMW 6 Series in terms of torque, which is roughly equivalent to acceleration. Torque equals pickup, and the SL-Class will have picked up and gone by the time the BMW 6 Series finally gets moving. <br>  <br>  Comfort<br>  While the front cabin in the 6 Series offers a bit more head room than the Mercedes-Benz SL-Class, there honestly isn't much of a difference. <br>  <br>  Overview<br>  The Mercedes-Benz SL-Class and the BMW have the same basic warranty.|`|ojxfzv7Faa	Mercedes doesn't have anything like the 6-series<br>  <br>  The CLK550 is about $20k cheaper<br>  The CL550 is about $20k-$30k more expensive<br>  The CLS550 has 2 extra doors<br>  <br>  I think it just comes down to what you need or want.|`|bY4DLWboaa	The CLK, CLS, and CL. But the website of Mercedes-Benz and BMW themselves say that the SL-Class is comparable to the 6-Series. And that makes sense, seeing as the 6-Series can be a roadster/convertible and that they're about the same price.|`|g24NZnjNaa	An SL550. It has 2 less seats, but it DOES have a hardtop convertible design and more power. The backseat of the 6 series is actually smaller then the 3 series.

If you think it's the carb. cross 2 wires on the dist. cap, start the truck give it gas to make it back fire through the carb., then put the wires back where they go and try it.|`|d9ECb7N8aa	Accelerator pump probably isn't working. So when you hit the pedal the motor suddenly runs lean, because there is no squirt of fuel into the intake.<br>  <br>  Spend $100 and just have the carb rebuilt. It will be the best $100 you spend...|`|74xzCuqfaa	Things to look at: Is the float set correctly in the carb? Is the fuel filter clean, and fresh gas in the gas tank? Have you looked for vacuum leaks and broken vacuum hoses? Are you sure the carb is getting enough gas to begin with? You can pull the main gas line from the carb, and crank the engine. If gas just drizzles out, the fuel pump may have issues. The fuel pump has a rubber diaphragm in it, which can rot out over time, especially using ethanol-laced gas. You should get a strong stream, with a heartbeat-like pumping action, as it's a mechanical fuel pump. Check the integrity of the fuel line coming out of the fuel tank, as they can get rusted, so you suck 1/2 air, 1/2 fuel.|`|lT4JTq9iaa	Check your fuel pressure with the correct guage.

The Trans Ams are Firebirds with special trim and came with just about all the engines except the Buick V8.  They had Pontiacs, Chevys and Oldsmobiles.  Which is best is just your opinion.|`|EMC7JwVBaa	You spell it "Their" when you mean them, and "There" when you're pointing to a place.

Check Chilton's Auto Repair manual and take note of the year.<br>  <br>  There was a time when GM used Chevrolet motors in Olds, Buick and even Cadillac, and alot of customers were upset. I wouldn't be surprized to find them in a few Pontiacs. This was around the time that Ford Mustang started using Pintos and dressing them up.|`|8zVxYkluaa	It depends on the years.

Try hitting the bottom of the gas tank while someone else cranks the motor over trying to start the motor. If it starts, take it right to a repair shop without turning the motor off and get the fuel pump replaced.<br>  If the battery is dead you have charging system problems.

gsjjiRGFaa	the only real differences between a base engine and one with vtec are the head & ecm. you could convert or swap here. keep in mind the mechanical items that will require your attention if you decide to convert. these include: head & block condition, machine shop time & costs, head gasket set, timing belt, water pump, swapping of any necessary wiring or accessories, etc. most of these are relavent even if you decide to swap. is there any way for you to locate the engine harness from a vtec car? you will likely need this to determine any wiring differences. <br>  i must ask you: why use the d-? for a few bucks more, you could step up to the b18c1, or was cost an issue?|`|3hQgISyGaa	You can convert it, but you will have to drill oil lines and stuff for vtec. It will probably be less complicated to just do a swap.

d9ECb7N8aa	Since you cannot place the transfer case in neutral, flat towing the Blazer would continue to spin the internals of the transmission.<br>  <br>  To flat tow it, you would need to disconnect the rear drive shaft from the rear axle. Tie the drive shaft up out of the way in a safe manor so that it cannot come loose and fall. You cannot simply remove the drive shaft completely, because you have a slip yoke on the transfer case, and if you were to pull the drive shaft out, all of the ATF in the transfer case would leak out!|`|AA10690306	Only safe way is on a full trailer, not on a tire dolly.

You will have to go back to the person who you bought the car from and request the title. You can then sell it after they sign it over to you to another person without registering. but first you MUST have the title.|`|17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	The ONLY document that proves ownership of a vehicle is the title.  If you don't have the title you DON'T own the car. It still legally belongs to the person who's name is on the title. You can wipe your *** with the Bill of Sale, it doesn't mean anything. Since you DO NOT own this car you can not legally sell it. The sale would be illegal and the buyer, if you could find someone dumb enough to buy a car without a title, would be able to rescind the sale in court. (You could have done this too, but you waited too long, and the statutes of limitations has expired)  Before you can do anything with this car you must get the title, and register it in your name.|`|WO68RZdIaa	Without the title, all you have is a very large lawn ornament. You cannot register it in your name until you get the title in your name. And most people needing a car will walk away, very quickly even, after they learn there is no clear title yet to the car- so if you do sell it, the only people who may buy it is someone who has a car like that & needs parts. Then they will not want to pay anything more that a few hundred dollars for the car, even if it would be worth more had you had the title for it.<br>  <br>  If you get the title cleared, you can register it without a driver's license.

TdrgZwnoaa	A cam lock is harder to release accidentally. And since it is centrally mounted on the belt it is easier to access. Also one cam lock can secure multiple belts so you require only one release. And unlike a buckle belt system the cam lock centralizes all belts in the centre of the body mass helping to keep the driver erect in an accident.<br>   The only disadvantage is that they take a few seconds longer to secure properly. But when done up the driver is assured that the system is secure.
WQjNd9sUaa	Transport or transportation is the movement of people and goods from one location to another. Transport is performed by various modes, such as air, rail, road, water, cable, pipeline and space. The field can be divided into infrastructure, vehicles, and operations.<br>  <br>  Infrastructure consists of the fixed installations necessary for transport, and may be roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and pipelines, and terminals such as airports, railway stations, bus stations, wharehouses, trucking terminals, refueling depots (including fueling docks and fuel stations) and seaports. Terminals may both be used for interchange of passengers and cargo, and for maintenance.<br>  <br>  Vehicles traveling on these networks include vehicles of appropriate types such as automobiles, bicycles, buses, trains, trucks people, helocopters and aircraft. Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose including financing, legalities and policies. In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode.<br>  <br>  Passenger transport may be public, where operators provide scheduled services, or private. Freight transport has become focused on containerization, although bulk transport is used for large volumes of durable items. Transport plays an important part in economic growth and globalization, but has a deteriorizing impact on the environment. While it is heavily subsidized by governments, good planning of transport is essential to make traffic flow, and restrain urban sprawl.|`|zlPAVkUBaa	Any transportation that isn't in the air or on water.|`|dUtLJcI1aa	The Transport which uses land routes is called Land Transport.

bADgVLswaa	Although the amp has a slightly larger power rating, I would consider this combo to be a perfect match. A slightly more powerful amp will allow more dynamic bass with a higher dynamic range. Your sub will be fine. It will run cooler because there will be less of a chance of clipping (when the amp runs out of power and the sound wave gets cut off(violently)). Clipping is what heats up the voice coil of the sub and that is what will ultimately cause failure. As a general rule, 25% over the sub's RMS power rating is perfectly fine. So go for it, and turn it up!! You will be pleased with the sound quality, if you build the right enclosure to go with the sub.|`|tLilNlptaa	This sounds like a good match, it is better to slightly over power your subs for rms wattage than under power them.

xTioPxaVaa	First, you need to know the resistance per 1000' of the guage of wire you're using (that's spec'd in the AWG tables).<br>  <br>  Then, you'll need to know the max wattage your amp can put out, and the impedance of the load.<br>  <br>  So, lets assume 100 watts for the amp, and 8 ohms for the speakers. We'll also assume a 50' run of 14 AWG speaker wire.  14AWG wire has a published resistance of 2.52 ohms per 1000'.  We have 100' total in our cable, so that's 0.25 ohms resistance in the wire.<br>  <br>  This could get tricky if we tried you use speaker impedance in this equation, as that's going to vary by frequency.  Just to keep the calculations from getting out of hand, we're going to calculate this as a DC circuit.<br>  <br>  So, we have 100w into a total circuit resistance of 8.5 ohms. <br>  <br>  Rearranging P=E^2 / R, you get SQRT(P*R) = E,<br>  SQRT( 100*8) =  28.3V across the circuit.<br>  <br>  The current in the circuit would be P / E = I<br>  100 / 28.3 = 3.53A<br>  <br>  Kirchoff's Current law states that the current is the same through a series circuit.  We can now calculate the wattage lost in the wire.<br>  <br>  P = I^2 * R  or (3.53)^2 * .25, which is 3.11 watts.<br>  <br>  You'll never miss it.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Your referring to the IR drop across the speaker wiring.

Possibly look into upgraded fuel injectors that will make a huge difference on the dyno when you get tuned.

fe7f5e169c58c4b7d96cbce63bcb83ffaa	Hmmm, I've worked in the industry for years, and haven't heard of GPM.<br>  <br>  If you've heard of problems with smoking or seizures with this brand, it can usually be traced back to the piston design or cheap material.<br>  <br>  Piston design that will cause these problems is a piston with two little taper - pistons are a bit pyramid shaped - the bottom of the skirt should be at least .003" wider than the area just below the bottom ring groove.  If the piston is pretty much straight up and down, then during operation the top of the piston gets hotter and expands more, and it seizes.<br>  <br>  Smoking would be caused by the same thing - or a machinist having to bore the cylinder much larger than the rings are able to seal.  This was a problem with early Wiseco pistons - they were made of cheap aluminum forgings which expanded a ton, so the bore had to be big - so they smoked.  They also seized if the bore wasn't big enough.<br>  <br>  I just did a bit of searching and found photos of GPM piston seizures where the piston 'cornered' - meaning all four corners seized.  This is from too little clearance, or too much piston expansion.  Most likely a bad quality casting that gets really big when it warms up.<br>  <br>  The last thing I'd want to do is put cheap pistons in an expensive engine - especially one filled with other un-obtanium parts.<br>  <br>  Heppolite should have pistons available for your B44, if not, then you can always have JE or Ross make you 4 of anything you wish - these very high quality forged piston manufacturers will create anything to your specification - cost is typically $220 per piston, qty 4 minimum.

Suzuki makes the DRZ400SM...<br>  <br>  You could also make your own from a dirt bike. Take dirt bike of choice, then add lights and street legal tires to pass for your state requirements. Just take your pick:<br>  Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, Suzuki, KTM, ect<br>  <br>  It all depends on your skill and how fast you want to go. <br>  <br>  The aftermarket is HUGE for the KTM and Hondas.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bajadesigns.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bajadesigns.com</a>|`|I9WjPm7Caa	KTM690 SM

cAMdBtFQaa	A bilge pump works with a little impeller in the bottom which pushes the water up the tube and over the side of the boat, typically they run off of the 12 volt battery in the boat.  There are both manual and powered versions available.  but who uses manual anymore except sailboat guys.<br>  Automatic bilge pumps are pretty normal right now, you can add an automatic turn on to a regular bilge pump, or you can buy one with built in automatic turn on.<br>  The first site will give you instructions on installing one with a 3 way switch to allow you to control both manual and automatic operation.<br>  The second site shows you a unit you can buy off the shelf and install directly with or without a power switch.  When I installed mine, I installed a power switch in line with it and a fuse.  I do want to turn it off when the boat is not in the water.  The fuse I included so if it did short out, it would not catch my wiring harness on fire.<br>  The last site is Wal Mart, that is where I bought my stuff.  I got the inline fuse holder and switch from automotive, the bilge pump was from sporting goods fishing area.<br>  Hope this helps.  It is basically how I did mine and it has been in 3 years with no problems.|`|d9ECb7N8aa	You would need to make sure that the pump is wired to a constant-powered source like directly to the battery (with an in-line fuse). The pump would have an internal float switch, and when the water got high enough it would turn on and pump out till the float shuts it off.<br>  <br>  Make sure your bow and stern lines are tight. If for some reason you have a problem, the lines will keep the boat from going down.|`|KQhIcU4Yaa	Mine works great.

dQrBlk4qaa	Okay - whether its a 305 or a 350, the exhaust note would not be significantly affected - the tone is practically the same. <br>  <br>  I would never recommend completely removing the catalytic converter on a street car that originally came equipped with it. There are enough resources out there for high-flow cats that you will not lose a significant amount of horsepower by retaining the catalytic function (and you will avoid any law enforcement hassles). <br>  <br>  Flowmasters do not necessarily have to be "loud" - they make several quiet, tame mufflers that make decent power without the thump. As a matter of fact, a very docile system is going on my resto-project late-seventies Camaro, just to reinforce the "sleeper" look/sound I'm shooting for.|`|7HDWtqhOaa	It maybe a 5.7L  but you can buy emblems and stickers to make a 305 look like a 350, and just because a tach shows so many RPMS in the yellow and so many RPMs in the red doesn't mean its a 350 either but more than likely it is a 350. question is, did the car have duel exhaust? The video number #1 looks like it may have been dual exhaust that is why so quite and the video #2 with the dynomax sounded so good it was single exhaust. Removing the cat is some US states is illegal and you do damage to the environment if you take them off. Performance cats is something to consider, most stock camaro's use 1.78" pipe, where 2.5" is better for Performance and in some cases mileage and sound, and dynomax uses chambers in the muffler and that's why is sounds the way it does.Look into Gibson exhaust|`|htWwCb3Jaa	Take off the Catalytic Converter and the muffler, put yourself on a set of Super Trapps with 4-7 rings, depending on what you like, quiet on idle, loud when you romp it and it's also fairly quiet going down the highway, just a hum. But you would also want to run true dual exhaust. Mabye mess with cam timing and whatnot but if all you want is a exhaust sound then Super Trapps are the way to go imo, Flowmasters are overrated.

The intake leads away from the engine, down towards the front bumper. This is to pull in cold air.<br>  <br>  All an aftermarket one does, is slightly increase the air flow. But it's so insignificant as to be basically pointless.<br>  <br>  The reason that guy's car sounds like that? Distortion. The exhaust is creating a soundwave, that is overpowering the microphone on his cheap camera. You can hear the echo to it, also. That's not the car, just bad recording.

When you take your car in for an oil change, they can't bring up any "codes" from your car if your Check Engine Light is not even lit.<br>  <br>  Anyone including Jiffy lube shops can go to the nearest auto parts store and buy an On Board Diagnostics (OBD II) scanner to bring up "codes" only if the Check Engine Light is lit "on".<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hondacivicrepairs.com/mil_cel_codes.asp?q=Trouble%20Codes%20(MIL%20/%20CEL)%20-%20Honda%20Civic&id=23" rel="nofollow">http://hondacivicrepairs.com/mil_cel_cod...</a><br>  <br>  Rule of thumb is right under your owners manual.  Turn to the maintenance schedule for all of the parts that need inspection and replacement.  You should change your air filter when it gets really dark and your vacuum cleaner can no longer help.  Change your brake pads the minute you begin to hear slight squeaking every time you press on your brakes.<br>  <br>  Unless you decide to change the oil yourself and provide as much self-maintenance, remain cautious and alert when bringing your car into any shop.  Times are rough and it seems everyone is looking for any opportunity to get a couple extra bucks.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|42b68e89556dc280a2061994ea854c1aaa	For oil changes and basic maintenance you will be fine.

Lots of places will try to hit you up for random fees.<br>  <br>  BTW: it *is* a good idea to get the tired rotated about every 10K miles. Take it from one who didn't bother having it done and worried only about oil changes.<br>  <br>  Read your owner's manual cover to cover.<br>  <br>  And if you're a woman...take a man with you to the shop because so many people (not all, but many) try to rip off women thinking they don't know anything.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

t2rUhyANaa	First, I think you mean to ask if it counts as moped or a motorcycle, since it most definitely is not a scooter. <br>  <br>  The Aprilia RS50 has a six-speed transmission and a top speed near 90km/h or 55mph. That means that it cannot be considered a moped anywhere. It is a motorcycle and it requires a motorcycle license.
6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	It should be on the bottom passenger side of the engine towards the transmission.|`|lT4JTq9iaa	David B is right...its hidden there by the exhaust.
WpqwaqcQaa	poor fuel economy, miserable rear seat, poor reliability.<br>  <br>  they have better choices if your looking at used<br>  Nissan Xterra or Toyota 4Runner<br>  <br>  if you can afford new<br>  Honda Pilot<br>  Nissan Pathfinder<br>  <br>  like Range/Land Rover,  jeeps were bullet proof 25 years ago, but today they are overpriced and cheap offspring of those golden vehicles.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Consumer Reports magazine, in the new April 2009 Auto issue, puts the Jeep Cherokee in the "worst of the worst" category as used car. This is based on the number of problems and poor reliability. How about a nice reliable Toyota 4Runner? You might pay a little more....but you get what you pay for.
AA10789220	That seems unlikely, but maybe you can park at the The Junction - St. George's Retail Park and sneak over to the train station. Otherwise there is the Calais Street Car Park, which probably charges. <br>  <a href="http://www.wikimapia.org/#lat=52.6321513&lon=-1.1234915&z=17&l=0&m=a&show=/9649746/Calais-Street-Car-Park" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikimapia.org/#lat=52.6321513...</a>
xLZGbS9Yaa	Yes. I believe you are limited to secondary roads, though. No highways or  boulevards. You must, of course, observe all traffic laws. And, I am pretty sure the Helmet Law applies in most every State, by now. Check with your State's DMV.<br>  (I live in Georgia)<br>  Georgia does not require registration or titling of mopeds and scooters if they are not used on roadways. But if you plan to use your scooter or moped to get to and from work, or to scoot around town for errands, you'll need to complete two forms for registration purposes.<br>  <br>  First, complete an Affidavit of Fact for Motorcyle or Motor Scooter. Then, head to your local Tax Commissioner's office to complete the process.<br>  <br>  You'll need to provide a copy of the manufacturer's certificate of origin or a current title signed over to you, and then Form T-22B, Certificate of Inspection when a designated agent or law enforcement office inspects the vehicle.<br>  <br>  Your street-legal scooter or moped will be treated much like a motorcyle during the registration process. The cost of a motorcycle tag is $20, plus any taxes and fees due at the time of registration.<br>  <br>  If you are considering the purchase of a street-legal moped or scooter to help combat rising gas prices, be sure to check out DMV.ORG's lengthy list of resources.|`|AA11914369	In those states that allow you to ride a moped without a license, there is usually a legal definition of horsepower and speed, which restricts it to those at or under 50 cc.  A 150 cc would be considered a motorcycle and a license and insurance would be required.|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	No.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Last I heard, the 'no license' limit was 50cc.s and 30 MPH.<br>  150cc.s is a small motorcycle already.|`|1xkc6Ktmaa	Unless you live in some undeveloped country no.|`|jFwuiRKxaa	Anywhere in the USA no
99d51d7904221eccbe69ab1589d39137aa	for the most part the wires should be the same colors....connect grey with black stripe to grey with black stripe....solid grey to solid grey etc
n7jXAQFWaa	A standard car driver's license will allow you to operate a 50cc vehicle as long as it is restircted to 30 MPH max ( this varies from state to state) whereas a motorcycle license will allow you to operate any scooter or proper motorcycle. Vespa almost goes without saying, but they should be mentioned. They are rather expensive compared to other scooters with similar displacement. Yamaha and Honda both make great scooters and have dealerships everywhere. Sym, Kymco, and Genuine all make good 50cc scooters but their dealerships are more sparse than Yamaha and Honda. DO NOT fall for any scams at auto shops or the internet where they have scooters for 700 or 1000 bucks. Those are cheap Chinese garbage. A good 50cc scooter will run you 2000 bucks or so but it will come with the same level of support that you're used to with a car, if not better.<br>  <br>  Spend some time with several and get an idea of what fits you best.|`|DLDHx6lnaa	I had the same idea, but rather than go for a scooter, I decided to buy a small motorcycle.  I went with the 250cc Honda Rebel; it was only a little over $1K more than a 50cc scooter, has about as much storage since I added saddle bags and a luggage rack, and it is fast enough for me to ride home from campus on the high way.  It also still gets about 80mpg, which is less than a scooter but much better, of course, than a car.  The trade off, of course, is that there is more you have to do for licensing, registration, and insurance.  I found it to be worth it.|`|fl60KL8oaa	For bopping around the local streets, to college, shopping, it would be hard to beat the Yamaha C3:  <a href="http://www.yamaha-motor.com/sport/products/modelhome/529/0/home.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.yamaha-motor.com/sport/produc...</a><br>  <br>  Huge lockable storage, cheap, easy to ride.  Liquid cooled, fuel injected|`|jFwuiRKxaa	A Kymco scooter  is about the best you can get for your needs. The ONLY scooters rated better than Kymco are Piaggio and Vespa. Kymco is far superior to Honda or Yamaha when it comes to Suzuki and Kymco cost less. They have many sizes and styles from 50cc to 700cc. Also Kymco is not a cheap Chinese import.
ManJOzqgaa	If your doing a motor swap, dont care about the sun roof (more weight) or rear disc brakes go for the hf there a lot lighter than the si and the hf is mpfi so the motor swap will be as easy as the si.|`|6t68dbfoaa	Go with the Si.  The cars are old now and they don't cost very much to buy anymore.  The Si is superior in every way, other than weight.  You could go with the HF if you're interested in tearing everything out and building a full on drag race car with a B18C or something like that, but I'm assuming that you're looking to do a motor swap only, so the Si is definitely a better choice.  Nice seats, better motor, brakes, etc.  Plus you can have a sunroof.|`|OgvkF5mvaa	are they stock motors?????<br>  the HF is for Fuel Economy <br>  The Si is more street racing type<br>  but yah the si would b better if planing or racing n hooking up if fuel then hf<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_CR-X" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_CR-X</a>
BUPiXrxVaa	A retarder on a vehicle is an engine retarder. It causes back pressure on the valves and slows the vehicle. Never heard of one on a school bus though.<br>  <br>  Other names for them are Jake Brake ( Jacobs Engine Brake), C Brake ( Cummins Engine Brake) and exhaust brake.|`|TdrgZwnoaa	'''wvparanormal''' is correct. I drive a THOMAS C2 SAF-T-LINER school bus with a retarder system that works in conjunction with the turbocharger on it's Cummins 6.75 litre diesel engine. It basically slows the vehicle down using engine compression. On my bus the retarder system is also tied by computer to the mapping of the downshift points on my 5-speed Allison Automatic transmission. This causes the transmission to downshift 'aggressively' when I take my foot off the gas.<br>   When the retarder system is active I rarely have to use the ABS brakes on this bus unless I wish to come to a full stop. The sytem can be switched off on slippery roads and when switched on activates the second that the driver takes his foot off the gas pedal.|`|umEgRb7Vaa	They are on the wipers and the A/C and brakes. They slow down the process of things, retarding them.<br>  <br>  They really are devices used to slow down the processes of other things. I used to have a Norwegian baking instructor who would call the refrigerator the "retarder" for this reason.|`|8eCyY7RCaa	They're the mentally handicapped children and they're there to go to school.  They're located in seats.
d9ECb7N8aa	The Z71 package was only available on the 1500 series trucks of that generation ('88-98).|`|fefea25d32d84e4e20a7a00602d67062aa	You can get the 2500 with all the same stuff as the Z71. Only thing the 2500 won't have is a the heavy sway bars and shocks the Z71 comes with. The 2500 will have heavier shocks and front sway bar than the Z71.
AA11754206	there was not a recall for it as far as i know i had the same problem with the reclining level in my 98 on the passenger seat and actually broke it off just pulling up on it one day. the inside of the lever that attaches to the mechanism is not strong enough so over time it wears out and won't work, but when mine broke off the metal bar the lever attaches to still sticks out and you can grab it with a set of pliers and move the seat to wear you want and just leave it there. they told me it was 150 to fix though if you want to go that route i just didn't care because I'm the only one who drives it so it wasn't bugging me.
36YoeltMaa	that looks like a great deal to me.<br>  it depends on what condition it is in and if you need to do any hauling of things like bikes boxes ect.<br>  <br>  id goto KBB.com and look up the car <br>  click on "search by: year, make, and model"<br>  then fill in all the information given.<br>  you can find a general starting price for almost any car here.<br>  you should always try to get a lower price that this site says too.<br>  good luck!|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	Quit worrying about what some famous person says, and don't spend that much on your first car. Chances are you'll beat it up quite a bit. A used civic is a great investment, and there's so many parts out there for it, it shouldn't ever be expensive to upkeep. And they get good gas mileage also. Also, insurance will be higher on newer cars, as they're more expensive to repair. When you're ready to get a car, test drive a lot of them. Find something that you feel extremely comfortable in, and can see out of well. No sense buying a car if it doesn't fit.
3NoQuoWuaa	Lets say you were negligent in a collision where a young mother or father of two or three kids died in the accident. You probably would be sued and a judgment rendered against you well in excess of your limits. Yes you would have to pay out of your pocket and if necessary, they could take almost everything you own. If severely injured, medical alone could eat up $100,000.00 and you would still be sucking eggs.Talk to your insurance agent about an umbrella policy.r|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Your insurance covers, not limits, your liability.<br>  If the liability exceeds the coverage, it comes out of your pocket, <br>  or your hide.<br>  If youv'e got $100K, pay the extra $50 a year, bump the liability <br>  to $300K, and hope you never need to be happy you did it.
TKyW5rCmaa	Yeah, one of my friends speakers blew in his car, we hooked some home stereo speakers in it,   If you want to replace them just take the door panel off, after that just take the speaker out and replace it. <br>  <br>  Just find one of the wires to your old speakers and hook it into your home stereo speaker|`|mSt1LGfjaa	yes we have used them plenty of times and used the same wires too,it will work just the same.good luck working on them tyler.|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	Banshee hit the nail on the head. House speakers use a different ohm load, taking 8ohms, whereas most factory car audio is 4ohm. You'll destroy the speakers after a while, and possibly ruin the head unit also.|`|AA10671693	you can hook up house speakers to your car but your going to find it very difficult because house speakers typically run on a 8 ohm current while car speakers run on 1,2, or 4 ohm typically. If you hook them up they will probably sound alright but unless you buy a converter your definitely going to blow them. Installing new car speakers is significantly easier and probably mroe affordable. If your not looking to spend a whole lot i would figure out what size speakers you need and try and get some cheap ones off of craigslist or ebay...sony, rockford, lightning DUB are all fairly decent if you dont push them to hard. Also keep in mind that you dont want high wattage speakers unless you intend on installing an amp to power them. Most cd player power somewhere around 250 watts rms. Stock headunits push even less. <br>  <br>  Hopefully i helped and good luck|`|uDuwc7Yoaa	a higher ohm load won't hurt anything in a car, it won't sound weird either, just a lot quieter because less power will go to the speakers. just think of hooking up nothing to an amp. will that blow it? nope, & that's an infinite level of resistance. Too low of an ohm load is what can hurt things.<br>  Anyway, what WILL hurt is all the heat, cold, moisture etc that goes on outside in the weather that house speakers aren't designed to withstand. don't keep those speakers outside if you want them to last
F4FCBEgzaa	2 things need to be investigated - fuel and ignition. Is your electric fuel pump coming on for a few seconds when you turn the key to "on"? Is so, check the fuel pressure. Pull your new plugs - are they wet or dry? Dry means no fuel, wet means a spark problem.<br>  Once you decide, ask more questions.
4KvLIa6Saa	Battery disconnect should do it>|`|HQrMEkm0aa	disconnect the negative battery cable for 1 minute should clear the light.  If this doesn't work, you would have to take it to the dealer or a garage to have the code removed by their OBDII scanner.
6dWlnf20aa	The first ones were around 1955,a great site to visit is Glassclassics.com It goes though the history of wood to glass and listings for some for sale.I have used this site alot my project right now is a all fiberglass Larson ski boat built 1956 one of 19 built that year.|`|6uOBkvXRaa	fiberglass boats were first built in the 1950's.<br>  <br>  Google images search for sailboat will give you a lot of pictures.  you can also do a search for sailboats on flickr.
muPiBQ3Uaa	Usually the reason it "falls" off the track is because of a broken slider in the track rail. The regulator arm cams out from the rail, causing the window to tilt out of the track. No way to repair other than replace the window regulator module unit which includes the window regulator, motor (if power window), and radio speaker.<br>  <br>  Hey, I dont design, build or break them----I just have to fix them.
nAK8bm91aa	Short to ground, or bad alternator|`|lW2W1ApBaa	Voltage regulator, Have your alternator checked, it has a built in voltage regulator, should show bad, have it replaced.|`|6t68dbfoaa	It is very likely that your alternator is bad.  The alternator charges the battery when the car is on.  Or you could just have a bad battery and need to have it changed out.  If you are constantly having to recharge the battery, then you're likely looking at a new alternator, but if the battery won't hold a charge, then you need a new battery.  Bring it to a mechanic and they can do a quick test of your electrical system.  It won't cost much and you'll know for sure.|`|lT4JTq9iaa	You can test the altrernator by putting a voltmeter on the battery terminals.  When the engine is off, you should have 12-13 volts, and 14.5 when the engine is running.
99d51d7904221eccbe69ab1589d39137aa	you position them in the trunk of your car since this is the car audio section
mKVFIklaaa	Very, very easy & straightforward. Just disconnect the battery first & the job is self explanatory.<br>  If you're unsure, get a local garage to do it or get yourself a Haynes manual.
3NoQuoWuaa	Do not under any circumstances sign a release for medical injuries. They are obligated to cover the damage to your car, lost wages, Rental expense for a car at least equal to yours while yours is being repaired and all medical expense. If any medical was paid by your personal health insurance, they will expect to be reimbursed when you recover from the adverse party. You will need an attorney to pursue pain and suffering but go slow with this. Attorneys charge anywhere from 15% to 25% for issuing notice of your representations, 25% to 35% if they file suite and 35% to 50 % if they go to court and get ready for 2 to 3 years until final settlement. Everything listed above is your "pie". The percentages are percentages of your pie if they win.r|`|yaq7oaH6aa	You are entitled to be made whole for any damage you suffered.<br>  Stop trying to 'milk' it.|`|0pE3dhT8aa	Find a good lawyer and you can probably get thousands for "pain and suffering". Do not accept $300...I guarantee you can get more than that. Much more|`|87756LlTaa	It sounds like you won't have a claim for pain and suffering, because that is reserved for permanent damage.  Go to a doctor.  The chiropractor may "help" pain, but he is not properly trained to diagnose traumatic injuries.  You could find out 6 months from now that you needed different treatment, and be out of thousands of dollars.  So..go to the doctor and be evaluated.  If he clears you for chiropractic care, then restart that therapy.  I'm a doctor, I've seen too many car wrecks like this, and the insurance company will try to screw you.  See a doc, if OK'd then go to the chiropractor.  Do not settle w/ the insurance company until the treatment is over and your pain is gone.  Once you settle, you have absolutely  no more claim.
fe7f5e169c58c4b7d96cbce63bcb83ffaa	At the top of the form, what does it read?  "Vehicle Registration" or something like "Title of Vehicle Ownership"?<br>  <br>  Is there a spot on the back of it that he filled out that's titled "Release of Ownership" or something like that?  If so, did he sign and date in this area?  <br>  <br>  Is the vehicle ownership information on the front?  If so, does it only list the person you purchased it from, or does it list a bank or finance company?
9SgD78JIaa	It's right behind the driver side headlight. You have to take the air filter out to reach it.|`|lT4JTq9iaa	Get your head under the engine...the oil filter is right there!|`|TEJoVBnOaa	It has been a while, but it I believe it is near the passenger side front tire.  As I remember it is not exactly easy to get to.  If you turn your tires to the right and look in the wheel well you may be able to see it.
AA11754206	honestly just go for classic with it you don't need to stand out let her be a sleeper. just go with one of the original chevelle ss colors for that year (since you didn't give a year so can't tell you which i like best) and then do white strips and some cragar rims.|`|OXfZUQV0aa	Anything but flames they are sooooo outdated and over used.A good tear or 70's style stripes would be good. Depending on the theme of the car.
4TZsKgAUaa	There is no dipstick, the system is sealed.  You have to remove the plug on the transmission to check it.  This is generally best accomplished at a shop, where you can pay someone else to endure the pain in the butt that it is.<br>  <br>  If you want to do it yourself, just find the top plug and remove it, but I'm warning you, it really is a pain.<br>  <br>  I'll usually do it myself if I'm under there anyway doing other things, but if that's all I need done, I let someone else get dirty.  It isn't worth the hassle when you consider that it isn't expensive at all to have her up on a lift where you can watch some other bugger curse about it.
43DHFQnKaa	color is less important than quality of the car....<br>  cheers04 cobra (silver vert, build #1267)|`|Ak35Y562aa	Red is typically the most familiar color...people KNOW what it is, if you got the cobra hood and the cobra wing!<br>  <br>  I would definately go with red, you dont see many red cobras other than the 03 cobras....and i rarely see an 03 cobra.<br>  <br>  Black definately looks good too!<br>  <br>  I like both colors alot, it would be hard to choose.....<br>  <br>  I've always wanted a Red cobra, but Black is my other favorite color for Cobras.<br>  <br>  <br>  maybe you can do a Black cobra with Red stripes or vice-versa....that would be AWESOME!!!|`|XoslhFR8aa	Black, brother. sure it's hard to keep clean, but when it is, it's gorgeous. Plus, just personally, i always see red mustangs around. hardly ever see black ones.|`|lT4JTq9iaa	A black Stang looks awesome but black is so hard to keep clean.|`|OXfZUQV0aa	RED
AA10643879	Check for carbon clogging EGR passages,if clear then take close look at the EGR temperature sensor at bottom of the EGR valve,also EGR valve lift sensor,on top of the EGR valve.Those tell the PCM of the EGR valve operation.Hope this helps.|`|2VCYL0F3aa	egr,egr vac modulator,vsv,vac hoses any one or more of these|`|q5VJM74Daa	The EGR valves on the 6 cylinders are famous for going bad.  Most likely thats whats wrong.  You'll need the EGR valve and 2 gaskets for it.
pxC3VJ7oaa	your going to have to drop the tank.that's where the fuel pump is located|`|F8wzcKntaa	Get rid of it and buy a new car.|`|lT4JTq9iaa	I think the pump is located in the fuel tank on those cars.  You'll have to drain the tank, disconnect the filler hose, unbolt the 2 bolts that hold the tank straps to the frame, then lower the tank enough to disconnect the wiring and fuel lines from the top of the tank.  (You'll need special duck-billed adaptors to disconnect the fuel lines.  The pump is held in with a circular ring, which can be turned with a brass punch and a hammer.  Lift out the pump with the sending unit, attach the new pump and reverse the disassembly procedure.|`|YXjItRexaa	either its in your gas tank or under rear driver side seat either way first!!!!!!!!!!!!!  disconnect battery !!!!!!!!! then if in fuel tank raise rear end  diconnect wire plugin going to fuel tank then remove tank top of tank has a cap that must come off DO NOT BANG ON IT WITH HAMMER unles you like fire use a non sparking drift or punch with hammer to turn this piece once off pump is right there take it out n put on cardboard do not throw away buy new pump compare some parts on old pump may have to go on new pump usually not all things are included when installing be careful not to bump fuel sensor if you do gas gauge will not work right installation is reverse of removal did you remember how fuel pump was positioned when removing very important and very easy to do
6t68dbfoaa	That is the check engine light, it could be something as simple as not screwing in the gas cap tight, or it could be something very serious.  Before going to the mechanic and paying $100 for a scan, look at the gas filler cap, make sure that it's there and screwed in.  Pop the hood and look to make sure that everything looks to be in order, check the oil level and then if you still can't find the problem, bring it to Honda.|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	Could be anything from a loose gas cap, faulty spark plug, or one cylinder not firing correctly. Take it to your local autozone, advance auto parts, pep boys, and have them pull the codes. Your vehicle has OBDII, an on board diagnostic system, so it will give them a certain code, and it will tell you what the problem is. First things first, check the gas cap, if it's still on, then visit your favorite local retail auto store. This will be free of charge. They'll give you a sheet with a code on it, come back here and tell us what that code is. Has the car been behaving strangely lately? Any change in performance or gas mileage?
C8DOT8Y7aa	Look at your vehicle. Many modern vehicles are being equipped with premium audio systems that are not easily replaced, if your radio or door panel has a logo on it (BOSE, JBL, Harmon, Infinity), you probably have a premium audio system. If your vehicle has a factory "premium" audio system, stop now and go pay a qualified professional to replace it. <br>  Buy a radio. Be sure that you purchase a radio that will fit in your car (some retailers tell you on the website if a deck will fit). <br>  Buy the correct vehicle wiring harness and a radio mounting kit. Buy the antenna adaptor. GM vehicles, some European vehicles, and older Nissans (pre-95-96) require an antenna adapter. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Installing Your New RadioMake sure you purchased all the install parts that are necessary (dash kit, vehicle wiring harness, antenna adapter). <br>  Make sure you have all the tools necessary to remove the factory radio, with most vehicles you will only need some screw drivers and a small metric socket set, but some Fords, and most European vehicles need special tools to remove the radio. You can purchase the Ford or VW tools from most good auto supply stores. <br>  Open up your dash kit and read the instructions. If you bought a quality kit it should have instructions on how to remove the factory radio. <br>  Disconnect the negative battery terminal. <br>  Remove the factory radio following the instructions provided with the mounting kit. Remember these dash pieces are EXPENSIVE to replace so be careful not to scratch or break them when you're removing the radio. <br>  Now that the factory radio is out double check that the vehicle wiring harness you were sold fits the factory radio plug. If it does you can begin to wire up your harness. The harness that came with your new radio and the vehicle adapter harness that you bought should have the same standard colors. Just connect them color to color--- red to red, black to black, Orange/white to Orange/white, and so on.<br>  <br>  Here is the breakdown of what wire does what:<br>  Red..............12v ignition<br>  Yellow...........12v battery<br>  Black............Ground<br>  Blue.............Power antenna<br>  Blue/white.......Remote turn on<br>  Orange...........Dashlight/dimmer<br>  Orange/white.....Dashlight/dimmer<br>  Orange/black.....Dashlight/dimmer<br>  White............Front left positive<br>  White/black......Front left negative<br>  Grey.............Front right positive<br>  Grey/black.......Front right negative<br>  Green............Rear left positive<br>  Green/black......Rear left negative<br>  Purple...........Rear right positive<br>  Purple/black.....Rear right negative<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Install the radio mounting sleeve (cage) into the dash kit by sliding it into place and then bending the tabs until it is securely held in place. Slide the radio into it's mounting sleeve (cage) until it locks into place. <br>  Plug the harness you wired into the vehicle radio plug and plug your factory antenna into the antenna adapter(if required). <br>  Mount your radio and dash kit into the factory radio location using the factory radio mounting screws(be sure to plug the harness and antenna into the radio), and re-install all the factory dash panels that you removed when taking out the factory radio. <br>  Your dash should now look exactly like it did before you started except for your brand new radio and dash kit in place of your older radio. <br>  Reconnect your car's negative battery terminal, and power up your modern electronic marvel.
WnV4ZTUYaa	Congratulations on the most incomprehensible question of the day.<br>  <br>  What exactly are you trying to ask?

AA11612269	you heard right insurance would be very high.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	Just get a 99-04 v6 Mustang.<br>  <br>  Plenty of power and still very good gas mileage for you.<br>  <br>  ~195 horsepower, 20city/30hwy.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	The reason that insurance is so expensive for the Mustang for 16 year olds is that it is wrecked more often by 16 year olds. Tell your parents that you won't drive it more than 35 mph and that you'll never have an accident because you are a good driver. Trust me -- you WILL wreck the car, and your insurance rates will go even higher.|`|jERevyR8aa	im 16 <br>  i understand how much you want a car so my suggestion would be for you to just get a used mustang that is a non-GT. The insurance will be a little less and the overall price will be less. Chances are, no one will even realize its used or that it isn't a GT.|`|d45eb3acaecdf47ac54a79e08ce342efaa	You are not really for that kind of power, chances are you'll total it, then your parents will be really mad.  I hate seeing kids that just barely have their license driving expensive, nice cars.  They don't deserve them.  You have to work your way to that point.  Get a beater, you are going to total at least one car in your life, and probably at the beginning of driving, so don't destroy a nice car many of us wish we could have, get something more to what you really could use.|`|gaVhPGWhaa	im 16 :] <br>  just tell your parents to buy it for you and you will pay them back. it worked for me.<br>  or just keep bugging them and dont listen to anything they say untill they buy you a car|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	Yeah its unreal how expensive insurance is for a 16 year old period. And a mustang is double. Make it a GT and its triple. It won't happen. And trust me you will wreak your first car. My friend got a new mustang when she turned 16 and totaled it a month later. But she bought it with her own money. Her grandparents wouldn't buy it for her. Hate to break it to ya but unless your parents are loaded and this financial crisis isn't effecting them it's not going to happen no matter how much you whine. Just be grateful if they get you any car. In a few years you can get what you want when you can buy your own car.
RW566BSUaa	there is a special section on ebay for this, you should check it out, im thinking of buying a one from there|`|lwbui760aa	You could check out factorypowerhouse,  I know they are having some sales.  Just call the number for the best prices.
BUPiXrxVaa	There is no such thing as a government repo auction. The government is not in the business of repo ing vehicles or selling repoed vehicles.<br>  <br>  Repoed vehicles are sold at regular car auctions not government auctions.<br>  <br>  Confiscated, abandoned, or vehicles previously used by the government may be sold at a government auction.|`|CoArPsIGaa	Yeah the banks repo cars cause people stop paying their bills. The ba.ks put liens against them and then its sometimes a hassle putting that car in your name. All you have to do is pay the cost of the car and the cost for new plates and all that good stuff.|`|UNnCxxQaaa	yes they are authentic.i go to them all the time.you can get a corvett for $2000.my buddy bought a 1964 cady in mint cond.for $3000 that car gos for like $10,000
