1O1ZyEhpaa	Ok your young so i will try and give you some easy suggestions so that your hair will be healthy and not break off    1) To make the hair less "poofy" when you are done is you can use a really good leave in conditioner like Lacio Lacio, Salerm 21 and lightweight leave in that will make your hair moisturized but won't weigh it down too much and pay alot of attention to your ends they are the oldest part of your hair and need the most care and put your dryer on low when drying your hair this will help prevent heat damage    2) PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE I can not stress this enough ALWAYS use a heat protectant if you are going to use a heated appliance.    3) if you cant do this have someone do it for you, you should do a mild protein conditioner like Aphogee 2 min after every relaxer to repair the protein bonds that were destroyed during the relaxer process. This will keep your in a healthy state while you stretch between relaxers    4) always moisture your hair. always. this will help you retain length    5) stretch your relaxers as long as you can, i stretch 8-10 weeks. the longer you stretch the less likely you will overlap your relaxers and that is not something you want to do to your hair    Good Luck sweetie    4) always moistur|`|2nWtytwQaa	try olive oil and egg white mask or flat beer leave on for 5 min and wash out this should help    Also to the relaxer drys your hair out A LOT! So you may need to do this 2-3 times a week.     I relaxed my hair for over 10 years to get my curl out now im just about ready to cut the last 2 inch's off. I would never relax, or color my hair again because of the damage it causes|`|tZQXqdfRaa	I have cork screw curly that is always puffy. I just got it relaxed and I cut so now when its stright its not puffy and very smooth. So I  think you should cut your hair or get a small trim that might help. Also relaxer last a while soo if you wash and straighten it again it shouldnt be puffy especially if you have a good straightener.|`|1de359d3e35bbb2f14339d32e84457ceaa	you might wanna invest in a quality flat iron---ceramic is best--i would also recommend a good leave in conditioner--that should minimize fizz & the puffiness. hope this helps.

jaUBFRn1aa	As a hairdresser I'd recommend:    *Regular trims at your local salon-every 4-6 weeks if you keep your hair short    *Don't overwash the hair-once every other day is sufficient    *Eat a healthy diet ensuring healthy happy hair!    *Don't be afraid to use products! Good shampoo and conditioner will make a difference!    *Rinse the conditioner in cool water and if you dry your hair make sure you don't burn the scalp!|`|i4O3Votoaa	Keep it really short.   1 at the back and sides and  3 on top.

041c59aee69c024c53fd24d42b14dc0baa	The question about foundation color is good.    You could ask:  Should I use liquid or powder foundation?  How do I apply eyeliner?  How do I know which skin tone I am?  Hos do I get rid of base lines?    Good luck! :-)|`|L1DUcTtSaa	Well good!|`|zHcDt8t7aa	Well What is the best way to apply foundation? and What is the best way to put my foundation on? are the exact same question.....so take one of those off.

ILKWjRL6aa	It has actually been proven men prefer longer hair as it shows their feminie.  But short hair can be very sexy if done properly.

vEoJO3gBaa	http://www.makeuptalk.com/forums/gallery...    Auburn/red. Like this picture, except I would go more brown.. not as red.
kTYw3LgYaa	It would depend on what color you want your eyes to look.  Purples look beautiful with both brown and green eyes- it should make the green really POP.  I would blend it with a dark gray (for a smokey look) or with a nice copper/brown for a more natural look. If you go with gray do a black liner and mascara, if you go with the more natural look do a brown liner. Add some shimmer to the inside of you eyelid and the on you brow line-it will catch the light and make your eyes look huge : )|`|BILIAKSOaa	You could try silver. (:|`|pjgQAXM7aa	I really think that worrying about your own appearance and literally matching everything will make you self confident, and therefore overdo your look. But I think a silver shimmer would do good :).|`|AA11334859	i find eye shadow that atches my outfit not my eyes, because i have flat black eyes, so anoything works. you should do a grey base and dim green eyeshadow in the corners closest to your nose|`|MwIHTOqVaa	purple will relly make your brown eyes glow :) and it'll look nice wit the outfit too :)|`|NuiHXYuOaa	red (not too deep)    that does it for me if you know what i mean|`|G6t2O9Kmaa	How about something in visible light?|`|AA12226240	silver!|`|UfWYWoOkaa	get a noir color expert in make up =)  ........|...  ........|..........2 Points..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|TaaQut43aa	brown|`|ssXPqdOraa	black eyes shadow, to complemet your outfit but not too much.

You could get alot outta this secret....play it. xx|`|JGxemN3waa	This behavior doesn't necessarily mean there is something psychologically wrong with your brother, although if you catch him doing it again I might think twice about it.    He could just be curious, he could have issues with your mother you aren't aware of, he could be trans-gender, he could have been doing it as a joke or a dare.    The only way to find out is by talking to him.  He was mean to you because he was obviously embarrassed.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	tell mother|`|PGRacfmdaa	Blackmail    that's all you can do :) and it's better if you have proof, so try and get a photo|`|MCN7gdI8aa	depends on how old your brother is... anything above 7 and there is something to worry about, and do not make fun of him!! maybe he is confused and so on, and the last thing he needs is for you to make fun of him! plus, if you are mean to him because he was mean to you, that only brings you down to his level! be the better person!|`|k2CwVuqqaa	Then I'd know my brother is Gay.|`|PCsW0gbPaa	Depends.  Did he look do-able in that outfit?|`|afikdpZoaa	Never let him hear the end of it !!    Wouldn't tell on him though, unless he really screwed with you.    To be fair, you should know that most transvestites are straight, not gay.  They just like wearing women's clothes.    But I'm sure your mom would not approve of him expressing himself in HER clothes.    Enjoy your new-found power.
ADkusTVXaa	Idea 1:  Items needed:    - Black Mascara  - Black Eyeliner  - Salmon Pink Lipgloss  - Bronzer  - Foundation    Steps:    1. Before you start, you want to take a good non animal tested face cleanser to clean your face of any old makeup, dirt, and bacteria that may be left on your face.    2. If you have dry skin, apply moisturizer on your face before applying foundation. If not, skip this step.    3. Take a foundation that is no greater than 2 shades darker than your original skin tone and start applying it on your face. (make sure your face isn't wet from the moisturizer!) Be sure not to leave any lines near your eyes, lips, jawline, neckline, or hairline. Use a foundation sponge to remove any clumps and to make your foundation more even and smooth.    4. Now for the eye makeup. Take a black eyeliner pencil or rolly pen and draw a line from the corner of your eye to the other corner of your eye. Also do this on top, be sure not to apply it on your top eyelid because this can damage your eyes.    5. Take your mascara and carefully apply it on both your top and lower lashes, be careful when applying eyeliner and mascara especially otherwise you will ruin your foundation.    6. Take a bronzer and apply it on your cheekbones.    7. Lastly, take some salmon pink lip gloss and apply it to your lips. Don't go over board or it'll look to glossy. Take a napkin or paper towel (toilet paper works fine to) and blot your lips with it, that way your lipgloss won't get on your teeth.      Idea 2:    1. Wash your face to remove any dirt, oil or make-up. Pat dry with a towel.    2. Apply a foundation the best suits your skin tone and rub evenly.    3. Apply a dark blush (bronzer) to the apples of your cheeks and bland upwards slightly.    4. Using black pencil eyeliner, apply a thick line to your lower eyelashes (just above your lower eyelashes).    5. Using black liquid eyeliner,apply a thin line to your upper eyelid, just behind your upper lashes.    6. To finish, apply a pink lip balm to your lips. Enjoy!|`|Pn99lZ73aa	http://media.photobucket.com/image/dark%...    you would just need mascara and eye liner for that  put some on, and then a minute later, put another coat on, and so on, until it gets as dark as u want.     you could go like this  http://i208.photobucket.com/albums/bb273...  and start out with like blue and purples for your eye shadow   or you could start out with light pink at the bottom and go to a really dark pink on top.  or a light blue going into a dark blue  or dark brown, or black.  any of that would make your eyes stand out, be dark and bold, while still looking pretty.|`|1Gb4Acbjaa	http://www.youtube.com/user/panacea81    Have a look through these.  Hope i helped!|`|aUtPV4Kjaa	Maybe put a lot of eyeliner on and darker eyeshadows.  Every day I put an eyeshadow color on half of my lid to match my outfit and on the other half i always put black eyeshadow. Its pretty cute. Also you can try some of these. Iv tried them myself:    http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h132/k...        http://www.nzgirl.co.nz/images/articles/...      http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h132/k...      Idk if those are helpful but you can go onto youtube and search in maybe dark eye makeup and you can get a lot of ideas.|`|jgTvzlUlaa	Well, first you need black mascara, black eyeliner, and black/grey eyeshadow.   First, line your eyes with black eyeliner.  Then, put on the black/grey eyeshadow.  Then, put 2 coats of mascara on. Only 1 coat on the lower lashes though.  Finally, put a nude or peach lipgloss on.  It should end up looking like this:  http://image.blingee.com/images15/conten...|`|OClVX3MVaa	wear liquid eyeliner if you don't already wear it.
BWxSSADaaa	The exact shades will depend more on her skin tone, especially for blush.  In any case, blue shadow looks great with brown eyes, but if she has dark skin then I wouldn't go too light with it, because it may look strange and cheap.|`|1Gb4Acbjaa	Next time you go to the shops, go to the loreal make-up area. They have make-up suited for your eyecolour and skin tones, hair colours etc. Heres the website to browse through     http://www.loreal-paris.co.uk/cosmetics/...

JL7jUb0yaa	I had dyed my blonde hair black and I used herbal essences bleach blonde to get it to platinum. It's still a little orange right now but my blonde roots went platinum. If you want seriously light hair go with that. Oh and it doesn't damage ur hair. I used it twice and my hair is still soft.  P.s. Even though it says bleach in the name there is no bleach in the actual product. That's the color  it gives you.  It's just hydrogen peroxide and hair dye that works just as good as bleach but it doesn't hurt ur hair
GQn5OC6baa	its really obvious what a split end looks like, it's literally a split end. if you grab the ending of your hair you should see it split into two strands at the bottom. if you cant find any then you don't have to cut your hair. they're really easy to find if you have a lot. but there's no other way to get rid of them except for cutting, all those creams and menders do not work.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	just have her trim your whole head, not just pieces. If she doesn't know how to cut hair, I wouldn't let her do it. You can't just only cut some pieces and not others, it won't look right. If you can't afford a salon, find a hair school in your area, all of the work is done by supervised students and it's much cheaper.|`|h3Ubar0Zaa	not at all  i have split ends  if you look at the bottom of your hair  the tips of them  they kinda have a "Y' formation  its where the hair basically splits in half.    A trim is all thats needed.
Z8d9ipxmaa	You can have it altered. Try asking at a bridal shop if they can adjust if for you, and ask what the fee is.     Otherwise, i know you can buy size 4 clothes at Dorothy Perkins' petite range. =D|`|NOz2NIMTaa	I'd bet. :]|`|cIROBuszaa	I guess if you take it to the tailer and get it extremely hemmed.

ADkusTVXaa	Just do something simple like:    1. Hop in the shower and wash your hair completely.    2. Take the blow dryer and begin blow dryer your hair making sure there are no wet spots left.    3. Turn on the curling iron, and while it is heating you can be brushing your hair.    4. Take the curling iron and start curling you hair. Hold each curl for about 30-45 seconds each.    5. Run your fingers through your hair to make it more of a loose curl.    6. Part your hair to the left.    7. Take a part of your hair and pin it down (to the left)    8. Use a little hairspray to hold the style in place.    9. Last but not least, enjoy your fabulous new hairstyle!

I'm sure you have some jeans, whatever they may be. If you have boots(uggs, sweater boots, etc.) wear those! Super comfy and super stylish. If you do, just where a cute and comfy t-shirt that matches. If not, just wear a t-shirt or hoodie and jeans that you feel comfortable in! No one dresses up for the Super Bowl, it's more of a sit back on the sofa, eat food, and watch tv type of thing(at least it is around here, in the midwest.) Don't take it too seriously or you won't have any fun! Good luck!|`|2aTJz91naa	Does it really matter? You're with your friends at the superbowl for fun. (Or maybe they're just random people you met) but anyways, you've heard the saying, "beauty must suffer"? Well, so must fashion! Stop being so picky!!! So either:    1.) Be yourself, wear whatever you want! If they only like you because of how fashionable you are, they aren't worth the trouble to impress.  2.) Go buy skinny jeans (Some are under $20) and a cute shirt  (No offense but how did you want us to answer this question? You didn't tell us too much about your wardrobe... We can't just say, wear blue legwarmers, can we? LOL)

ADkusTVXaa	Things you need:        * Brush        * Curling Iron        * Hair Band        * Clip        * Hairspray        * Hair Protection Products (optional to protect hair from heat damage)        Steps:    1. Turn on the curling iron and let it heat up while you brush through your hair thoroughly.    2. Take about ? to 1 inch pieces of hair and start curling them with the iron gently from the top of your head and down excluding your bangs. Leave it in to where its not a complete ringlet but a nice curl as shown in the picture. Hairspray lightly after each curl and do this to your entire head except for your bangs.    3. Pull back the front/top part of your hair to the middle on top of your head, and puff it up in the front, then secure it with a clip to the top of your head. (If you are confused look at the picture)    4. Take a hair band and pull the rest of your hair to the back and pull it into a messy bun. (look at the picture if you are confused)    5. You can spray one last coat of hairspray onto your hair if you want. Make sure you turn off the curling iron. Enjoy! :)|`|vEoJO3gBaa	Put your hair in a pony (curly hair) and then just kind of gather it with your hand into a bun shape. Then tie an elastic around it. Pieces will fall out but then just tuck them back into the elastic however you want. Just play with it. Its a very messy style that can be done a lot of different ways. Good luck!|`|mwJUEqvqaa	scruch ir hair- if you hve bangs dnt scrunch them. then with a comb pull it up and twist ur hair and then tie it  if have bangs clip them
EdU7u08vaa	there are products out there. humidity blockers. Or the keratin treament done at most salons that removes the frizz but leaves your curl alone. It lasts for about 5 months in the winter and 3 months in the summer. The one we use is 100% natural. We put the product in, put you under the dryer for 20 min blow dry it then lock in the treatment by straighting it with and iron in small sections. We have been doing 100's at my salon its becoming very popular. It makes the hair easier to manage and cuts sytling time in half. were running a special $150. on regular it can be any where from $175-375|`|fMPyLqW4aa	I use dryer sheets and rub them on my hair. I also like the John Frieda Collection frizz serum.|`|Zh7QcGLtaa	John Frieda doesn't work. I use dove frizz control or treseme!

They make them to tame frizzy hair, and it works great! You can buy them at drug stores. Also, if you don't blow dry your hair, start. Letting it air dry makes it frizzy too. Best wishes! :D
DfDss68haa	Sorry I don't know how much it would cost but I don't recommend you get a relaxers.     Relaxers strip hair of moisture, destroy layers of strands and can also cause chemical burns on the scalp and hair breakage. It's a toss up really if it's more damaging than straightening every day. The sodium and calcium hydroxide in relaxers are very strong hazardous chemicals that can eat away lead pipes. But yet we put them on our scalps for long periods of time.  http://www.nappturality.com/modu...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1...    Both damage hair but relaxers can penetrate into the scalps and bodies. I personally believe this becuase when I stopped getting relaxers, my new growth coming in was still damaged and relaxed. So relaxers can affect the hair follicles and seep into our scalps! Scary. And there have been studies done where hair stylists who apply and work with PPD chemical hair dyes and permenants have a higher incidence of blood cancer and other cancers.   If you MUST relax your hair here is site to an apparently all natural relaxer:  htt://www.treasuredlocks.com/chemical-...     I recommend http://naturallycurly.com is you are interested in embracing your natural texture.|`|btMmriQvaa	No! Don't|`|47rMSA3paa	No, don't please!! It WILL ruin your hair. Trust me you can't go back.  |---  |-----------2 Points--------|||"|""\__  |__________________|||_|___|)  !(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|NOz2NIMTaa	No way! Your hair can fall out and become damaged.|`|vL6Lm9Szaa	Do not chemically straighten your hair    Trust me it's worth straightening every day, because if you use the chemical straighten it totally ruins your hair and makes it all fried. But if you really want to get it done your regular hair dresser probably does it. But if she doesn't, just phone around to different beauty salons and ask if they do it.    Hope that helps :)|`|QVFwuErEaa	No dont do it! i know this girl who had  curly hair and then got it chemically straightened and lets just say she now cant get her hair to lay down ight it sticks up in every direction!|`|p5K0cObAaa	don't have it chemically straightened.  if anything have it relaxed and have a professional hair dresser do it.  make sure they have training.  the relaxer doesn't even have to sit on your hair that long, and it is much less harsh on your hair.    you can later follow it up with a deep conditioning at a different time.|`|JvY5KL22aa	it's ok to get it relaxed just as long as you don't do it a lot. i get my hair permed like every 2 years. all it does is change the chemical balance in your hair, so instead of being poofy and a little curly it'll be straight and hopefully flat. and yes, you can go to your regular hair dresser. good luck!|`|vEoJO3gBaa	It is HORRIBLE for your hair. HORRIBLE.  If you want a temporary fix, use an at home perm, without doing the 'curl' part. Just comb the chemicals through and follow the instructions. But that is still bad for your hair.   If you straighten it all the time, then it is already damaged. Don't damage it even more!|`|A0SsXJ4zaa	go for it, curly hair sucks, i have it, i hate it|`|wXx0tMxnaa	well..it all depends on how you look at it.When someone tells me such and such a product will "damage your hair"it usually means itll lose volume.    people with curly hair usually have too much volume in the first place..  im pretty sure its fine if you get your hair chemically straightened as long as your willing to take a risk..    can you get it done at a regular hairdresser..im not sure..  plus you have to think about price too..|`|dW9pFT9Daa	You can ask your regular hairdresser but I would ask someone with experience. The thing with chemically straightening your hair is that if you do it more than twice (in prob a year), you literally go bald. The chemicals used are very strong and can damage hair very easily. Try it for the first time but make sure to keep your hair healthy by treating it at the salon because you are most likely going to end up with dry damaged hair. My sister had VERY VERY curly hair and it was so pooffy and thick it wasn't funny. She found it is easier to handle now even though she almost went bald because everytime she found her hair was going curly again she would go back and do it again. She only had to do it 3 times for it to get really damaged. She hasn't touched it ever since and only gets regular haircuts because her hair has permanantley stayed straighter than it was before. Your hair will not go straight and sleek, it will just be more managabile. I would think about your decision and if you really need it. Also if you decide to colour or highlight your hair that will cause much more damage because your putting more chemicals into it once again. So think about it and hopefully your hair will turn out great!  I also should mention that my sister straightens it now and it turns out good but her hair doesn't look smooth and healthy as much as anyone elses. I'd stick to straightening it (not everyday) if it looks good. It's more worth it in the end.|`|UbrN5yytaa	I have had my hair chemically straighten and it made my hair really soft, silky, and shiny. I have poofy and frizzy hair but after getting that perm, it became so tamed and nice   I think it would be better for you instead of using a straightener daily..also lasts you a whole year :)   yes, you should be able to get it done at your regular hairdresser..any salon really.    hope this helps :)|`|9xnSnRmraa	yeap|`|EdU7u08vaa	If your hair is really that bad then i would go for it. It is damaging but so is striaghtening it everyday. You have to see if the salon you go to offers it and ask for a consultation. This way you and your hairdresser talk it out and understand what you want. There are various options in hair straightenings.|`|asZTDIkIaa	Yeah It's alot easier to do it once then straighten it everyday. I have to warn you though that chemically straightening it doesn't make hair as straight as using an iron. Also it's not that bad for your hair.|`|rDug05OLaa	it might look good, but it doesnt stay for very long. Some of my friends got it chemically straightened and they still have to straighten their hair every day. Its really really bad for your hair. And if ever wanted to donate it, you know for like cancer patients or something, you can't because there are chemicals permanently in your hair.|`|CSFlbIKAaa	When you get your hair chemically straightened it doesn't help the hair look as soft, and beautiful as when you actually straighten it with a flat iron. Getting your hair chemically straightened makes hair look very dry, unhealthy, and frizzy. So, yes, your hair will be straight, but you'll still have to use your flat iron to take away the frizz. But that still leaves your hair looking frizzy and unhealthy. So, don't get your hair chemically straightened. Just keep using your flat iron, and do a deep conditioning treatment weekly, to keep it in good health. Good luck =]|`|kYJt1gALaa	If u really think it is worth it.  i have my hair done like that  it makes straighting my hair so much easier.  if ur hair is in a bad condition i suggest u shouldn't.  It is true that u get a lot of split ends and stuff  u would have to take extreme care of ur hair if u do    it works for me maybe not 4 u  every one is different  maybe u can just change ur hair style     and not all of hair dressers can do that most can but not all,  make a wise choice and don't do anything u will regret.  =D|`|igI5yX0vaa	Don't; it weakens your hair so that it breaks and doesn't grow long.

kwkOaDDlaa	Everyone does not think that you have to have a tan to be pretty. Surely even you know its ONLY the ugly girls that get all tanned up & orangey, thinking they look better-which they probably do because they have such plain faces-so at least their slighlty more noticable that way. LOL. Real attractive women are usual lighter skinned. When you look natural you look more unique any way & any good features you have are actually more noticable if your not orange. I am fair skinned & I know I am not ugly but I certainly would look ugly if I were to get a "SAME AS EVERYONE ELSE TAN" I think girls look so stupid ORANGE...dont you?  xxxxxx Be proud of your skin-You soooo know you look better.xxxxx|`|MGjMjWwaaa	idk but i have freckles and fair skin.. doesn't bother me|`|tMvHR1n3aa	well every one has their own perfernces ..in some countries its ugly to be tan,,so its not just the white people that have to deal with this ****..why dont you be happy with yourself and dont bother with peoples standerd cause most of the time they are wrong ..and its  waste to try and correct every one that dosent have the same oppion as you..|`|cweT8Phpaa	I see many girls beautiful without a tan and are beautiful, its weird people are mean.  http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g274/p...  http://i197.photobucket.com/albums/aa272...

I did it for me, and still do. My husband cannot tan to save his life, and that is OK with me. I enjoy the sun and use a SPF for my protection. I always have enjoyed the sun even before I was aware of boys/guys. Many people could just do that for themselves, I guess you are running into artificial/superficial girls. I used to live in Wyoming and would get a tan, lived in Arizona and got a tan, and lived in Texas, and got a tan. I live in New Mexico, and guess what I still get a tan. I did it before I was married with a child, after I go married, and while I was PG. You need to start looking in a better place for real girls/women.

rcEvWB1kaa	ive been using the clean and clear kit for 3 months and it is WONDERFUL!!!   i have seriously tried everything out there, and for me this worked wonders.  i know the commercials make it sound cheesy, but i could seriously tell a difference after the first two days.  the little tube of what im gonna call zap cream is fantastic.  had the BIGGEST zit of my life on my cheek and i put some of the zap cream on and it had seriously started to dry up in a few hours.  i find that with bigger pimples if you scratch the head of it then apply the cream it works much better/faster.    also, this kit is very inexpensive for what it does.  just make sure you use the moisturizer diligently, otherwise the wash tends to dry out your skin.        if blackheads are your problem, i also use the neutrogena wave.  im not sure how it works, but its been clearing mine up!  i like to mix the two, put a little of the clean and clear face wash on the wave's scrubbing pad, and BOOM!  you have an oil free, baby-butt smooth face!    hope this helps!|`|a29qiNkvaa	I used Arbonne Clear Advantage!

Q3hh7n1paa	hair doesnt stop growing...hair continues to grow, and despite people saying getting trims keeps it growing faster, its a lie, its a scheme for hair stylists to make money.  healthy hair grows from a healthy body full of healthy fats and collagen.  so find some food with healthy fats and loaded with collagen.  carrots r good, avocados, bananas, olive oil in your cooking. just remember everything in moderation. good conditioners and shampoo are good too. nothing from cvs, walmart, or those places. get something from sally's or ulta. itll last longer and help ur hair

The sideburns I'm not so sure out, though. I don't know if they'll grow at the same rate. They should.

4VdRmfwyaa	I belevee that you should find one that YOU feel comfortable in and throw away everyones advice if you don't like it.  In my opionion set a short sleeved one for training because if you get a long sleeved one you'll have problems overheating (even if you live in the snow regions) and the long sleeved ones are more for compertitions than training anyway.

d7T2XrXvaa	Wear tight jeans with Chucks. Get all the rieally cool colors to match different shirts you decide to wear. Speaking of t-shirts, buy the fitted sizes cuz they are more feminine but are still casual at the same time. Graphic tees are really cool. Go to pac sun, hot topic, or tilly's for awesome tees. And accessories are key! Wear black bracelets with a different color that goes with your shoes or your belt, you know? And wear light, natural make up. Natural browns for eye shadow and eye liner on the bottom only. No lip gloss or blush is necessary unless you really want a bit more color, but keep it natural. Straightening your hair always looks good too. Make it straight, smooth, and shiny with hair serum.

[with a peace sign.]  -LOVE.    or maybe smething like this..  http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QYaKQV3DquA/SB...  http://i138.photobucket.com/albums/q279/...|`|uAhqtWuyaa	I saw a gangster movie and the VATO had the abbreviation " **** the world"( FTW)   on his lips .. that's bad azz|`|OR4uvkylaa	thats tacky.|`|gAuIixm6aa	WELCOME TO TUFF TOWN.|`|vCXzfhTpaa	hahah cuz a bible verse is going to fit on her lip...... maybe if she got them dsl's!!!     anyway... put RAWR!!!! or "lol" or "party'' or "hello"    haha. i assume you dont want the tattoo to be taken seriously cuz its a joke funny place for one so do something silly.     or else do a diamond.|`|7JjPTlgJaa	Its foolish.|`|1khjjEkSaa	Love in Chinese ?  :D|`|bFFAv5kIaa	YOU COULD LABEL IT "LIP".  OR "INSERT TONGUE HERE"|`|htzdYg1Kaa	It should say I'm a loser!!!!!!!:* take that Chicky|`|mVInwaeAaa	You could make it say something rediculous like "look at this" or something on that lines.  You could have it say somehting simple like "Baby" or an old nickname of yours, or current one.  "Kiss me" is not real creative, but a thought.      Personally, I think barbed wire would be sweet however most people would think barb wire is more crazy than the tatoo itself.    Just make sure whatever you decide is what you really want, because once it's there - its there.|`|QhTUyI37aa	i don't know what you should put but sounds like it would be pretty painful. im not trying to be mean or talk crap. i just think you should think about it long and hard before you do it. i know someone that did it and it got messed up really bad and they were very upset and wished they had never done it. remember tattoos are permanent and getting them taken off is way more painful then getting the actual tattoo.|`|G5umwRBkaa	But no one will see it, right? So is it just something you want because you want to remember something or know something?    If that's the case, maybe it should be a proverb or a bible verse, something to make you feel strong & empowering    Maybe something like strong, powerful, beautiful - in english or in french or spanish    or something like matthew 19:26  or romans 3:23 ( my fav!)|`|RtlQC0Hdaa	hahahaha  i know someone that got an inner lip tat that said please  so when they pouted their pout read please  i thought that was pretty cute  :)  ouch though eh?|`|m8f8zAb5aa	live.    p.s. LOVE lip tats, theyre so hot. i want one sooo badly!
6ycZ1LO5aa	I like bikinis on me personally... I quite skinny well a Uk 6-8 but i quite flat chested do i go for like the string triangle bikinis... With something tht doesn't attract attention to my no boobs lol..   If i had the body for a bond girl one piece i would so wear it!|`|19c8NIGHaa	wow sounds nice!  not to rain on your skinnyness parade but a UK size 6 is a US size 2 - and when i was in america i found that american sizes are still big. Like i'm a UK size 8/10 and i fit into a US size 4 perfect.  God i envy your figure :P|`|gOm09Bqsaa	i like bikinis for me - simple ones which tie up with strings.    like triangle ones, give off some cleavage and little bows on the bottom.|`|XTbYi36Jaa	If you have the body I would wear a bikini, but if a swimsuit or tankini looks good on you then why not. It's what you feel comfortable in.|`|PYXVZzGAaa	I think it sounds amazing... I recently got a D+G cut out swimsuit that is black and like a leathery material. I love it!!... Im also size 0 and I love my figure and obv you should tooo!! x|`|HwaAAIOEaa	I like bikinis that are deep colors on me like dark red or purple|`|M9wcO2lxaa	i just like colorful bikinis !! and on guys what ever   all swim shorts look the same :P|`|0fwiToNoaa	I'm boring and just wear a pretty functional swimsuit with underwiring (large bust). I don't feel confident swimming in a bikini (especially backstroke). I fear things will come undone!|`|SZ9BNWVIaa	I love that bond girl kind of thing.  I like, a bit more coverage than string bikini, and one that covers my bust completly.   xx
90ZaNZE4aa	I did the IB program  graduate hs with a unweighted gpa of 3.8 and weighted GPA of 4.2    if you study hard, your grades should not come down
EdU7u08vaa	I think you have a gorgeous natural color! But in the summer i would jus add a few highlights to the top. Your hair is already on the light side so your highlights would have to be really light like a platinum blonde. It will not change your natural color when it grows back. and since your hair is light already it really wont look bad as it grows out. When people have really dark hair naturally and try to do light blonde highlights it looks bad when it grows out.|`|D8lmVzyvaa	First of all I think that yerrrrr like really pretty    Yeah! Highlighting your hair would look good! Ask for amber colored highlights, and nope, after awhile the highlights fade out so no worries! :]    -Alana|`|yK58oehFaa	i have to say that you are very pretty. I wouldn't change your hair color in whatever season might be. It looks very good. You don't have to change it. Really...you are pretty and you have very beautiful hair.|`|8mD9O03laa	I wouldn't. it's hard to take care of sometimes and it looks pretty as it is.|`|8b36b5fa272b7209a075d42972a9d95faa	I would leave it the way it is. I think your hair already has good color to it and it would definitely look like you dyed it if you added a color. Also if you don't like it or decide to go back to natural it takes forever to grow all of your hair again and then your left with streaks that are starting form the middle of your hair.|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	Your hair looks great. I wouldn't do anything to it.
UAMtRFruaa	They look nice on a young girl. I thought about getting one. Then I thought how it would look when I'm 50. I think it would be safe to say I would look like a tramp. And a pretty trailer trash one at that.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	just another derogatory term for a woman's choice of where to put a tat.  notice no one calls them that on a guy...|`|XrMMH5tZaa	a lot of dirty girls have them  but having one doesnt make u dirty|`|FsBUKc1vaa	nothing. but usually when a female does something a man does (get tattooed, etc)..a  holes like to attack their womenhood and call them names. its so stupid. I think mine is cute and I aint a tramp :)|`|3cwY3Lcpaa	Mostly because they are associated with prostitutes & strippers, and some girls get them to attract attention to there booty!    I love my tramp stamp, i dont care if no one else does, its on my skin not theirs!|`|vCXzfhTpaa	Cuz people are lame........ Idk I think its a good spot for a tattoo depending on what you get... maybe it's called a tramp stamp cuz u can see it if you are bent over having sex?? lol just a guess.|`|m33uMKPxaa	the only reason we call them tramp stamps cuz mostly tramps have them|`|3927497f0169ee5dd95646d151f98f7eaa	i agree with nick|`|NBK3s2LVaa	Because people are ignorant
DlMsJPwUaa	I really don't shop at MAC I get most of my makeup from sephora but here is what my friends say    1. Don't buy foundation there, it makes you break out horribly and even ages your skin.....eeeeeewww    2. Eyeshadow is really good, You can coustomize your own pallet of 4 colors for about 50 dollars, and thet have lots and lots of shades.    3. eyeliner is supposed to be really good, especially the waterproof kinds    4. Im unsure about blush and bronzer.    5. Lip colors are really good, they have tons    So basically its a good brand witha  wide range of selections|`|78588e3257514586ce18e14f16018f9eaa	The top three things from MAC that I would NOT substitute with any other brands is their studio fix (pressed powder foundation), eye shadows and most importantly their brushes.|`|iTBt5m3daa	studio fix fluid foundation spf 15  mac 188 brush  brush cleanser    and all the eyeshadows are goooood! :)  the lipglasses are nice too|`|514fe92d3b5ee587bad2e6c4029a3b3baa	I love my mac lip glass it last for a super long time. I also use their mineralizer, and studio fix foundation. Just don't cakr it on your face. You do not what to look like a drag queen( no offense). u are a natural pretty girl.

2cf6501c9a3f33cf51f80b825ae1fa82aa	Oh man do I know what you mean. I live in Newport Beach so I can't help you out but you should look on Yelp.com - they have a ton of reviews for stylists in whatever area you are looking at.     Also, if your stylist screws up your 'do, you are entitled to ask them to fix it for free. The only downside is you might have to wait a little while (with bad hair) because you don't want to damage your hair. If they refuse, speak to the salon manager or get the manager's card and call them directly to complain. Hairstylists are in customer service so it is important you let them know you are unhappy, without being rude of course.
TlQW67MFaa	i know im not a guy but i know this.   it all depends on the guy. some of different tastes. but most prefer little make up. a natural look. if its too glam its a complete turn away. it makes you look fake and superficial.   and guys don't really pay all that much attention to make up anyways.|`|HnWKJLZoaa	All depends on the girl..i can think of several id rather wear makeup and several not so much|`|s4psKJrPaa	not a ton, but not too little. even tho im a girl HAHA!    mine? http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|peckUVpzaa	Guys always say they prefer without make-up but when they a woman with some make-up thier heads turn. Just try to make it natural not like wearring 3 inch cover-up thats orange and cracks. I mean ok some of us do need cover-up but dont pile it on and makesure its the right colour. But if your going to wear make-up definetly wear bare minerals. Their is nothing wrong with wearing clear lip gloss and a little bit of eyeliner. Just dont do dark black eyeliner with black mascara thats when your over doing it. Choose the mascara or the eyeliner not both! Just like cover-up dont pile the eyeliner either...|`|XKYP0sGQaa	To be honest, I don't mind. I am actually not a guy that judges girls by their looks so it doesn't bother me. Although, one thing I don't like is girls that plaster on make just to look good for the benefit of others. If they want to wear make-up because they like wearing it, then fair enough, but going to the hassle of applying it for the sake of looking good to outsiders, is not a good idea. Besides, isn't make-up supposed to give you spots ?|`|JYhr37xRaa	well if ur naturaly beutiful it shouldnt matter but some girls have bags under there eyes or just there face looks blank and im 14 and i dont care if u ware makeup as long as its not lipstick or really colorful and thick  maybe just some eye blush or whatever but not alot   but dont worry about it guys dont really care as long as you look hot and im guesing u do soooo good luck|`|LLh7PAkaaa	not too much then it looks kinda gross like shes a barbie doll|`|MnGGEMwBaa	Well makeup isnt everything. If you plaster on makeup and also throw on skimpy things it sort of gives of a slutty impression. I mean no offence to women like this but that sadly is how you may be perceived by the more shallow of us. Makeup isnt really a turn off except when a girl has a tanned face and white neck. You get the idea. I definetely appreciate makeup that makes a woman appear sexy of course. Just dont overdo it. Have a good 1|`|vJkLFDxnaa	as long as you dont put soo much make up it makes you like a cake face but i rather little make up if it suits you if you look better with a little more than do a little more it does depend on the girl
98LDN0Quaa	maybe something like this with your front bang pulled back with a slight puff, but view the clip and i think making the pony tail higher and a little off to the side would be nice to   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SqHoYtUp...|`|ILKWjRL6aa	Straight side fringe. Half pinned up with the rest down and curly. To make your hair extra curly put some mouse in it with your head tipped upside down.  Finish it off with serum, spray some moisturing spray on it and you'll be ready to go.    Good luck    Tabitha  x|`|6IxJPUh3aa	Well, since your hair is already wavy, straighten it with the help of some hair cream (it helps it look more silky), and then mousse your hair.     Then, tie your hair up and take bits out and do waterfall curls in layers, starting from the most-inner layer. Remember not to go to crazy with the layers, and the mousse should keep it in place, add some hairspray if its going to be a long night.     Don't curl your bangs, leave them the way they are after they are straightened.      :) It works really well for me, since its casual, but sexy.   Here's a pic of what the hair should look like after: (it's alba, not me =])    http://www.kissmestace.com/wp-content/je...    have fun!
0EaA6IACaa	noooo not the same size.    if you are you are a 0 or 1 then you will most likely be a 14 or a 16 in kids.    i wear a 1 and i fit in the 16's.|`|9PptaFdXaa	lol, no, kids sized are different. if you're a size 0 or 1 ( that is also my size) then size 14( as in, suitable for age 14 kids) should be fine. it depends how tall you are though. look at their sizing chart :)|`|1sfYOZNbaa	no kids are totally different. you are in juniors sizes so you can shoe at the regular A&F. the sizes start over again in juniors
849ce38541bfaee2a43ed99365c27d13aa	are u by any chance downtown...........yeah, downtowns include stange ppl|`|vVtGiLOxaa	i may no him them :-O   i have a friend who wears orange EVERYTHING even shorts soooo haha
hEC87Vj8aa	i like it, it is really pretty but looks too formal so you might want to have something more loose|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	It is called a body wave.|`|6tIoJzMQaa	i think it looks nice , dont know the name of it to :(  can u answer my question pls :D|`|8b36b5fa272b7209a075d42972a9d95faa	Well it's differents and i think it's pretty cool it would have been better if i could see it with all hair down seeing you'll have to live with it every day. And it depends of your hair color as long as it isn't bleach blonde i think it will look fine.|`|b53e2a1258c62190ce26de62eac42691aa	this is ugly|`|tFCYaZvRaa	I don't think the girl in the pic has a purm (usually perms are tighter curls and tend to be frizzy)  I think you should try using a styling gel and then use big hot curlers to get this look.  Also, if you don't like it...you're not stuck with it for months...the permanant is called "permanat"  because it is exactly that....permanent!  Try the style on your face before you do something drastic that you may regret.|`|t9rulFv4aa	I think if the curls were a little more loose and natural, it would be a nice look.|`|cK768YMkaa	This is coming from someone with really naturally curly hair. All the pictures that you see of curls dont always look like that! They are very difficult to manage and you might want to start curling your hair before you decide that you want it permed! Its definitely not like straight hair where you just brush it and it looks fine! You cant brush your hair with curly hair or it will be ruined!|`|I6zQeNGzaa	That looks rediculous and unnatural. I couldn't imagine getting a perm like that and having my hair look like that everyday.   You can get soft pretty natural waves by just curling up your hair in sponge rollers and sleeping in them.|`|7nGwou8uaa	it the curls werent so tight yes|`|yuF2K1rLaa	its call the S-perm by the way.  Idk i say go for it if you want to look like a flaming queen from the 16th century french villages.|`|ro3X9fs3aa	perm? omg u going to ruin ur hair , and that style u can get with a curling iron without damage ur hair to extreme|`|auFmP7J1aa	i dont know. i dont like it  i think this looks better  http://www.bobcut.com/hairstyle-photos/i...|`|ePim7L2zaa	no way,dont do it its nasty...|`|UCKAiLN1aa	I don't think it even looks good on that face. It looks too set, not natural and pretty.|`|soUND2xEaa	that just looks retarded(thats my opinion though)|`|djuRlggeaa	i dont know about that...|`|odQewFgvaa	I am not sure a perm is the way to go. Try curlers or a curling iron.  A perm can look a little 80's|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	As long as you don't have color treated hair you should be ok. I would go to a PROFESSIONAL salon to have perming done, like a salon that sells products like Aveda or Paul Mitchell, not a Best Cuts, as their products won't be as damaging to your hair.|`|D8lmVzyvaa	Hmmmm... I got my hair permed and it totally RUINED my hair :/    I suggest purchasing a curling iron because it's way cheaper, faster and easier! :]    Lots of love,    Alana|`|KEWbsDTIaa	also keep in mind that perms dont work for everybody. One person might get one and it look great and the next person get the same one and it look awful. I agree with the above poster and just spend the perm money on some curlers or a curling iron. You'll get tired of having your hair curled in my opinion. I love my hair curled but it looks so much better when people aren't use to seeing you hair curled.|`|RXSu3VNdaa	that is not a perm!!! it is a hard hairdo but you use a flat iron and a curling iron.|`|NOz2NIMTaa	Perming your hair can be a big mistake. Maybe purchase a curling iron?|`|bQisGgSsaa	Not Bad.|`|PdIRHRZgaa	beautiful|`|363YPQ62aa	I like it, I think it would look good|`|KhojMxfOaa	It definitely has an old look to it. If the curls looked more flowy and bouncy then this style would work! Especially since you have blonde hair, it would be pulled off better than the picture!|`|RMJ5OtO1aa	Risky, has to fit your face shape right, takes a lot of maintenance.|`|3TCkgzOpaa	it's.......  well..................  kinda depends..............|`|3UKMW0Avaa	personally i think her hair looks like corkscrew pasta...i like striaight or wavy hair    but if you like it don't let anyone else decide for you|`|86UVdNqaaa	..not bad|`|sHf6pbpqaa	I think that that style looks really unnatural  However, I would suggest just buying a curling iron  If you're getting a perm, make sue it is a loose wave, not a tight curl  Also, you're hair will shrink in length A LOT so if you're hair is the length of the girl in the picture's who already has a perm, yours will be at least a few inches shorter|`|IHmf7F63aa	no it doesnt even look good on her face and it wouldnt look so good with blonde hair.|`|rev4lrn0aa	I think that is cute and would look good on most face shapes. Just keep in mind that perming your hair can really damage your hair. My sister got one years ago and it looked really good but it was a lot of upkeep and she never did it after because it was too much work for her. Maybe just curl your hair with a curling iron or with hot rollers? If your still set on getting it permed, you should talk to a hair proffessional about it, they know more about upkeep and how it will look on you. If they seem unsure or like they don't know what they are talking about, you should talk to someone else.|`|SCTkHr7saa	not sure what its called but it really depends on the face shape and the length of the hair. i think those kinds of curls would be really hard to pull off but that's just me. print out that picture or look through magazines and take it with you to the salon.|`|6DxEDRReaa	i think the curls look a little weird in that picture...just too neat and perfect.  why not try something like this? i think these curls look amazing.    http://www.beauty-advices.com/wp-content...   good luck!!!!
9WMgb4phaa	Yes!!! Everyday!!!|`|42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	Yes...and I have no issues with damage. When sitting at home with nothing to do for a week, I might go 3-4 days before the feel and look puts me in the tub, but I generally wash it every day - 6 times a week (and in the summer when cycling, as much as twice a day, 5 times a week, and once on the weekend).|`|vuPJipLeaa	Not my hair. My body so i dont stink. Lol. Washing your hair everyday is sort of damaging. its like taking out your oils. Not washing your hair for a day ro two wont be bad. you still smell good?|`|LhEoVly0aa	no, apparently that is bad for hair and i couldnt be bothered lol, i wash it every 2 to 3 days|`|c412a0ba42c4332ae22e5d9eee001110aa	yea... my hair gets really oily fast and becomes wavy if i don't wash and blow dry my hair every day.. i wish i could go a few days without washing it though... much faster in the mornings and better for your hair!|`|AA12215623	nah weekly.|`|kW287jUPaa	Yeah  every day|`|b53e2a1258c62190ce26de62eac42691aa	yup|`|MBPR4PX5aa	depends on what it looks like.   I like the messy look so I usually don't wash it EVERY day.  I hate it when it's greasy.   Sometimes I'll wash it more than once in one day if it's like that.  One time I went four days.   It looked awesome. haha  But I bathe the rest of me.|`|MIx1fSbdaa	No, if I do it gets too dry.  Depends on your hair type, I suppose.|`|jAc7AgOiaa	Yes, but I have curly hair so I'm not supposed to.

ZHSvvao4aa	hollister is better, in my opinion; you can't really even compare the two stores.

gEkLQWF4aa	Do push ups and chest exercises. Google chest exercises and it will give you links. What this does is increase the muscle under your breasts which pushes them up and makes them perkier. I do this myself, and it totally works.|`|hzo8Bdnxaa	Well. There are some excercies you can do. like you can tand tall facing the wall, lean against it with your hands. Press against the wall as hard as you can, as if you want to move it, keep on pushing for 10 seconds. Relax, shake your hands. Do a set of 10 repetitions. or you can  join your palms in front of the chest and press them hard against each other for 3-5 seconds. Repeat 8-10 times.  I hope that helps.|`|rfkVin6Iaa	There are chest workouts you can do. I saw this thing online, just look around on the internet.|`|CPxLHfKoaa	Well it sounds like you are doing everything in your power to. just keep on working out and eating healthy and it should resolve itself.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	well there are allot of things you can do chest excesses, rub firming lotions on them every day, ice packs for five min a day,avoid sports bras at all coast they cause sagging|`|fPviDdmMaa	...awkward|`|HId11ztpaa	i think its funny that your question is about boobs and your user name is "tay tay"|`|iVapI5JPaa	just work out.

Chest presses laying down with small light weights. Maybe 3 to 4 pounds.     38 C is a good size chest, so eventually there will be a little sag, but it's not big deal really. Don't sweat it. If you lose just 10 pounds or 15 pounds if your overweight, you will see a difference in your chest, because that is the first place to go!    Good Luck and do not worry about this bull.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	You can do work outs that require you strengthening the muscle that is behind the fat of your breast.

1o6bzLVbaa	try using 3 minute miracle from aussie. it's like conditioner.  http://well.ca/images/large/products/aus...|`|OiRwNf3Vaa	in terms of products I have no idea because for me I usually use like really cheap shampoo and conditioners (suave, I think that's the name but it works really well for me). Well since you live in India, wear a hat or something to cover your hair to prevent it from being more damaged and dryed from the harmful UV rays. I wouldn't advice you putting oil in your hair because it would just burn and cook your hair in the sun and it clods hair follicles. I agree with the first answerer with the fact that you should condition your hair but dont' do it every day just every two days. Also avoid harsh hair products with strong chemical. Try to have a healthy diet and drink a lot of water to keep both your body and hair healthy. I guess that's all you can really do. I also heard from somewhere that you can scramble an egg in a bowl then dump it into hair and leave it there so your hair can absorb the protein making it healthy or something. I wouldn't advice you trying this because I tried it and it was impossible washing the egg smell out of my hair but if your desperate then try it but in order for results then you have to try it often. I have no idea if it has dramatic effect because I only tried it twice but it's just something I read off an article on the internet.|`|NOz2NIMTaa	Maybe put conditioner in your hair when it's dry?|`|jAc7AgOiaa	Don't wash it everyday. And try some products that have Olive Oil in it. It works really good.|`|6af207c38805ab4288e53331ea169938aa	Hey Sammy,           I don't know about shampoos you can use, but I do have some home remedies, I hope they work!          1) Avocado and Banana:    Use an overripe banana and an avocado, mash them together and leave on hair for about an hour and then rinse it out with warm water.       2) Use henna, olive oil, honey, and plain yogurt. Mix them all together until you get a smooth paste, then apply to your hair, do it for about 2 weeks....    3) Use beer.... Rinse your hair with beer       Try to avoid heat, hair straighteners or curlers can dry up hair quickly    Wear a hat... too much exposure to the sun and leave your hair dry     Always swim with a cap... the chlorine in the water can damage your hair      I hope you get healthier hair soon!!!    :)|`|f38784dc5f964420836559ea503219ccaa	I have the same problem so I use Infusium 23 Moisturology it works wonders. After that I put a Olive Oil packet and sit under a hooded drier for about 10-15 mins and then rinse it out that seems to work. I don't know how thick or what type of hair you have but if your hair is thick enough I would also suggest some type of oil after it dries. I use Hot 6 Oil

RWt78jE5aa	The piercing itself does not hurt. I was scared when I got mine done and I was only fifteen ( I am 19 now ), but was relieved when I got it done because I didn't feel a thing! It feels like if you were to stick a thick needle through like 9 pairs of jeans. Now the after effect was horrible, it's different for some people, but the swelling the next day hurt and irrated, I couldn't eat solid foods for a week, I lived on slurpees and soup. The swelling got better after a couple days and with the help of getting crushed ice. If you get it done, make sure you wash your mouth out with listerine ( the yellow kind ) after anything that is put in your mouth, like if your a smoker or even after you eat. Also  I would refrain from kissing until the swelling goes down, because you do have a change of ripping the hole a little bigger.    If you get it professionally done, don't worry about dying. There are two vains underneath your done ( you can see them if you look in a mirror ) and if hit, you could die.    But all in all I think it was worth it. I love my piercing and don't plan to take it out ever unlike some of my others. I love buying new jewelry for it, and after I got it done, every guy I kissed said I was a really good kisser.    Some people don't swell up bad after the piercing, my friend ate chinese the same day and didn't have it bad, but I did. I could talk fine tho, unlike my sister who sounded like she had food in her mouth for 3 days.    But the piercing does not hurt itself, just the swelling. =]    Hope I helped.    Edited- I read people are saying about infections, as long as you use the listerine like I said, you should be fine. Also it's harder to get an infection on your tounge because of the saliva ( that's what my dentist said ). Also after a month when you change your barbell, I would go with the steel balls still since the plastic ones easily unscrew or break if bitten ( i have swallowed plenty), you also want to get a shorter barbell too.|`|GOsRusM9aa	DON'T DO IT! It looks weird! OUCH!|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	If your technique doing fellatio doesn't excite your man, a tongue pierced may improve it. Go for it!|`|rev4lrn0aa	It doesn't hurt, you can't really feel it at all but when they put the needle through your tongue you drool everywhere for a second lol. There is an arterie that runs down your tongue so, yes, if they pierce it in the wrong spot you could die. When I got my tongue pierced, they pierced it a little uneven and it never healed correctly. I got antibiotics which made it better for a minute but then it just got infected again. I had to take it out because it was disgusting. It was a waste of $50.00. Plus, bacteria can build up around it and anything in your mouth gets into your blood stream and it is bad for your heart. I wouldn't do it if I were you. Pierce your nose or something cute like that instead.|`|Qxk1V55Zaa	if you get it professionally done you won't have a problem but there is a vein in the bottom of the tongue and it you hit it.. it will bleed.. you will get an infection in you tongue and since the vein is open the infection will get into your bloodstream and you will die.. so seriously.. go get it done professionally|`|lY82TsNBaa	If its pierced in the wrong spot it could make your teeth fall out|`|49q6Rxa6aa	I doubt it could kill you, but personally I don't care for tongue piecings, I think they're gross. (Just me.)|`|NOz2NIMTaa	Okay, first off, that's true about the dying part. BUT, the professionals know what they're doing. And it hurts very badly.|`|pO7crzORaa	i have my tongue pierced and i didn't think it hurt. If you decide to get it done make sure you get a titanium bar put in, it will help it heal quicker. also make sure you have a certified piercer, then your very unlikely to have any problems occurring|`|9h66XysJaa	It hurts alittle bit but in the end it is tottaly hot!!|`|1mQlYWG7aa	I wouldn't do it if I were you.    My mom used to work at a hospital and somebody got their tongue pierced and had to come to the hospital because it got infected. So my mom had to do a painful procedure just to get the ring out of their tongue. I would hate to have the same thing happen to you! Please reconsider getting your tongue pierced.     Thanks for considering and best regards.|`|hb7dwrpfaa	Personally it didnt hurt me at all... its just a little uncomfortable`when they put the clamp on your tongue to hold out, i followed the aftercare instructions.....i ate a lot of ice, and in 3 days the swelling went away.    I also got a Monroe piercing and that didnt hurt at all either it didnt even get swollen    However DO NOT get your nipples done .... that hurts like hell. it took about 3 months before it stopped hurting|`|cvIMUbGuaa	there's some great information from other users. follow all of it. I totally support your piercing fun!  keep you jewelry titanium til you can change it, then try to use plastic balls with titanium bars. less wear on your teeth. just change the balls every couple weeks.

Z4Rvf2pbaa	swaetshirts are meant to be washed inside out, it sounds like ur washing on a too high temp for a start and ruining the garment, most washing powders work just as well now on either a 15 degree cycle or a 30, also use a good fabric conditioner, dont be tempted to just use the powder even if it states that it has built in conditioner, as it doesnt do as good a job hope this helps Gilly x|`|4n6yhUbyaa	1. dont wash it  2. dry clean maybee

AA10906900	You can try a great website to try on various make up looks.    Go to www.marykay.com (click on the 'Virtual Makeover' area) and you and upload a photo of yourself and try on eyeshadows, blush and lipsticks to see how it will look on your face.    I think you may have to sign up in order to access the site features however, it's all *free* and you don't have to purchase anything.    It will give you a great idea of what colors look good on you and which ones to avoid.    I think they also have a feature where you can try different hairstyles too.    Good luck and have fun!|`|DsgNMpEsaa	Seventeen.com has one :]|`|2zYIBE9zaa	seventeen is probably your best bet..  theres one on mylifetime.com...  but itss ehhhhh...|`|JGS287Eeaa	ummm....dailymakeover.com    it is sorta realistic, but be careful, cuz you can only post ONE PICTURE UP!!!!  so make it a good one.
CzaEFJQdaa	it depends on what type of lettering you get, if coloring and shading is involved and who is going to be doing your tattoo.  Many artists have different tattooing styles.

It has a really  nice smell - it's kind of tropical. It works well and  makes my hair really soft. And you can use it as  leave in conditioner too (it said on the back.)  2) Redken Smooth Down shampoo  $14 from Trade Secrets. It makes my hair a LOT  less frizzy and much smoother and shinier.  3) Pantene Moisture Renewal shampoo  $5 from Wal-Mart. Works exactly like the Redken  one if not a little better, with a better smell and it's  cheaper.  4) Joico Moistue Recovery shampoo + conditioner  $20 for a set at Trade Secrets. It was such a good deal  since it's usually about $20 for one or the other. Works  really well but not as good as Joico Daily Care. Still good  though.  5) Joico K-Pak reconstructor  $15 at Trade Secrets. BEST SMELL EVER!  It smells like bananas. The gold bottle really stands  out with all my blue and white ones, it works well, and  I love Joico.  6) Boar bristle hair brush  $5 - $10, Wal-Mart.  Makes my hair a lot smoother and softer.    Most of my other hair stuff is just mediocre.    Makeup:  1) Revlon Colorstay concealer  $7, drugstores.  I never thought I'd find a concealer that  works so well! It dries in 60 seconds, and doesn't  look obvious or crust up around pimples. It's the only  concealer I've ever tried that works properly.  2) Clinique High Impact mascara  $14, Sephora.

ConcealRX made by Physicians Formula is Really good at covering up all imperfections and blends nicely.The best concealer i've tried.its around 7-9 dollars.  Burt's Bees lip balm. I like the replenishing one with pomegranate. Its around 2-4 dollars. It keeps lips moisturized without any harsh chemicals   Blistex lip infusion moisture splash lip balm. less than 5 dollars. Perfect for wearing outside. its got an spf 15 and a smooth roll on applicator.  Pretty Much everything from herbal essences smells amazing. Their Shimmery Nights shimmer spray gel gives hair a hint of sophisticated sparkle and smells great. Under 10 dollars  Always curl your eyelashes with an eyelash curler because even with the best mascara, its the only way to get the full effect!  Dove Cool Moisture products sooth skin and smell refreshing.prices vary by product.  Aveeno positively radient cleansing pads do wonders on skin making it smooth and soft. the price is around 4-7 dollars.  Conair gel grips hair styling tools are really fun. the handle is squishy and conforms to your hand. I have the brush and I love it.its not very expensive, around 10 dollars, and yet it keeps my hair smooth and reduces split ends.  All of these products can be found at most drug stores. good luck and happy shopping! :D|`|iNneJk47aa	http://productsthatwork.rare-boutique.co...

tfTQ6Cuuaa	black light ink would not show up in the dark, only under a black light. unless you meant glow in the dark ink and in that case it would show up  provided it was exposed to light before you went in the dark. in regular lighting i dont think you would be able to see it.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	The problem is that you're not going to know how visible it is in regular light until after it heals.  Most kinds of UV reactive ink will show up faintly, some kinds more than others, and there is always the possibility that your skin will scar and that will always be faintly visible, even if the ink itself is not.    If you really want a tattoo that is completely invisible in the day, but lights up under black lights, you're out of luck.  Besides, UV ink only keeps its glow for a year or so, then it fades and is hard to see without a touch up.|`|CzaEFJQdaa	NO, i have  a tattoo with black light ink and you CAN NOT see it under regular light.     Your tattooist will even tell you that.     The ink tends to fade with time and didnt last as long as i thought it would on my own tattoo.     In my opinion , its probs not even worth it unless you are regularly under black lighting.

jbTNER3caa	Ok, so no, don't surround yourself with people that are bigger than you to make yourself feel better.  But, who you hang out with does effect how you feel about yourself.  My old friends were all bigger than me (by like 30-50lbs!) and yet they all thought they were hot stuff and I was the one that was self conscious.  This is because they were always making comments toward me about my body.  Also, my ex would do the same types of things.  At the time I was with him, I was 5'7"ish and about 125-130lbs.  He was really little, less than an inch taller than me and probably like 10lbs heavier.  So he would tell me to lose weight and stuff.  That made me think even worse of myself...      So surround yourself with positive people.  After I broke up with my ex and got new friends, I actually lost weight and now weigh 115lbs.  I didn't do anything to lose it, I think it was just the stress of being around such negative people.  My current boyfriend is a lot bigger than me, 6'2"ish 200-210lbs, and he makes me feel SO good about myself.  He's always telling me about how gorgeous I am and how perfect my body is (even though it is not perfect. haha).  So just surround yourself with good people.  People who are supportive and not going to make you feel bad/stress you out.  I now feel great about my body.  You just need to think positive and not listen to the negative comments.  Most likely they're just jealous anyway.|`|0PVp8Okoaa	By setting goals within' reason and achieving them and exercising and eating healthy.  eating junk and not exercising will not make you happy with yourself, guilt will take over - trust me!!  i started going to the gym and eating healthy, and i feel better than ever. at the gym i set goals for myself etc. i'm going to run on the treadmill  10 mins non-stop. when i achieve that i feel great, and then i progress the goals up and everything. its great, try it :)|`|fMnrAhtiaa	hang out with someone fatter than you. you'll feel skinnier.

Do the same thing every night before you go to bed. Try this for awhile and the more you do it the more you will want too.
ggcS6JnFaa	In my left ear I have: 16g rook, 14g conch, 2 lobe.  In my right ear I have: 2 16g helixes, 16g tragus, and 2 lobe.    The most painful of all was my rook, and my favorite is my conch. The conch was surprisingly easy, and healed up very quickly/well.  :]|`|QAQHJFI9aa	My favorite is my industrial. It's the only nonlobe piercing I have, and the reason I could get it was because I was so set on it. It didn't hurt much.     I also like rooks and vertical traguses, but my tragus unfortunately isn't shaped well for a vertical piercing.    To the person who said that surface piercings hurt the most because they go through plain skin, shouldn't that be the other way around?|`|X9PIqr05aa	my favorite peircing is the corset  it looks really kewl and pretty and is very abnormal  any surface piercing would hurt alot; more them others probaly because your going through plain skin  the problem with them is that your body can reject it|`|BDboz1eAaa	I dont know about my favourite, maybe my tragus.  It is also the one that hurt the most, like it kills!|`|FS9ibKB5aa	i like tragus percings.   i dont think that it was painful at all.  also nose piercings are cute on some people.    the most painful piercing i has was my hand web which is between the pointer finger and the thumb.  i dont have it anymore|`|eHUJOD0daa	my favorite is my septum.  its as painful as the industrial|`|f2240d2dc5cd27e0a679d6fe53d46128aa	i have a helix orbital in the top of my left ear i   http://z.about.com/d/tattoo/1/0/3/L/pier...  mines the other way though like with the little ball on top

Plus your skin pays for cheap products in the long run.  If you're interested, e-mail me  if you can or post on your question that you are, and I can tell you about some inexpensive products that work great for my nieces acne and left their skin soft.

Here's are excerpts from 2 websites which might help    "Hair Style for A Long face Shape     Your beautiful long face can be made to look less long with fringes, soft half-fringes or a chin-length cut which is fuller at the bottom, add width. Anything but a long straight bob, which will make you appear even more long faced and pulls down your whole appearance."    "Oval faces are the most versatile face. Many different styles will work for you, but no matter the length of your cut, you'll look best with layers near your cheekbones, lips or chin -- basically whatever feature you want to highlight."|`|a4bd96dcb7b6c4b2e1b26176b088b451aa	Your face shapre is more like the first link which is this picture So i am assuming this hairstyle would also look better. http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk65/...|`|zGtELDrnaa	i would say that your face shape is more like tina fey, you wouldn't look bad with her hair either|`|wL7v53Unaa	Oval.I think the first cut would look nice on you|`|qqR0Pua5aa	your so pretty lol you definitely have same face shape as tina fey..|`|ApLFywiPaa	you have an oval face. like tina fey. the blonde has more of a heart shaped face.|`|WRRRChiaaa	Personally, the first one would look better :]|`|PRKRmnZ1aa	tina fey. oval face shape and that length hair|`|ZvSLSeteaa	I think the first one.

oGO9a5IKaa	Trim it regularly. Use hydrating conditioner, or hair repair shampoo. Its really not expensive. I dont really recommend those big brands like pantene and head & shoulders, because my salonist told me they use a lot more chemicals than a natural shampoo you can find at a drugstore. I used pantene before, and it just made my hair greasy. Now, I use this natural shampoo from Jason which uses honey and natural organic ingredients...it works like magic!|`|fzVsRMZbaa	1. stop dying ur hair  2.no hilights or ANY chemicals in ur hair  3. shampoo and condition ur hair every OTHER day, so that the natural oils in ur hair can come thru and hydrate ur hair, if u wash ur hair too much(every day) it stripps the natural oil out of ur hair which makes ur hair dry.  4. use deep conditioner in ur hair once a week  5. don't use straighteners or curlers on ur hair    i hope that helped!

2cf6501c9a3f33cf51f80b825ae1fa82aa	I understand you are shy, and I tend to be as well, but you paid A LOT of money to get what you wanted and the simple fact is that she did not give you what you paid for. She didn't do it intentionally, and I'm sure she's screwed up before, and since she is a professional she should be willing to fix it for free. You need to just call and ask. If she refuses, THEN speak to the owner. You don't have to be rude or mean, just say "after getting home and styling it myself, I realized it wasn't what I originally wanted. I was wondering if you would be willing to fix it for free?".     Aside from the fact I think it was pretty immature of you to skip work (granted I don't know what you do for a living, perhaps this is allowed), if you did that and cried AND paid $150, you need to fix the problem. Don't let people walk all over you - and yes, I've had many hairstylists say "oh it looks so good!" when they know it doesn't, just to try to convince me of the same thing.|`|9hggEdf1aa	go back|`|2I5XqMDzaa	yeah go bac kto the salon and have them fix it they should do it for free.|`|fjTVAbdBaa	I would call the salon, ask to speak to the owner. Tell the owner exactly what happened and telll them you want it fixed. You should have to pay anything, she messed up your hair. It sounds like she didn't let the highlights process long enough, it didn't lift the color enough hence the nasty orange color. Be bold, get it fixed.

Wy0lUjP9aa	Drinking 8 to 10 glasses of water daily (which is only 1 cup 8 or 10 times a day) because this washes the toxins out of your body so your skin can stay clear. It also helps with acne scars. You have to be patient when using vitamin e oil capsules because scars are deep damage, also are you using capsules or oil because oil loses its value after it is opened so you use capsules and poke them open and apply it to your scars. You can use lemon juice on your face, leave it on for 15 minutes and wash off but it can irritate your skin. Also you can make a baking soda and water paste. Apply it for 10 minutes and wash off. Also, use a soap before you use it. It burns somewhat but I can deal with it.  I have just start using this last night and have been noticing that my face feels smooth and is less oily now. But I want to see these scars disappear, so I will still try it.|`|RWt78jE5aa	I started getting acne when I was like 11, it finally went away when I was 14 after using stuff from my dermatologist. Than 18 rolled around and it came back. I have been through every product on the market trust me, I have really bad black heads and a couple pimples here and there. I finally found products that do work, and is really clearing up my black heads and making my pores shrink. I got clean and clear pore cleanser two weeks ago and the moisturizer to go with it, I am getting the toner today. But just using the cleanser and the moisturizer, omg its really made a difference, better than anything my doctors prescribed to me. Make sure you do use the moisturizer because the cleanser tends to make your skin dry.    Hope I helped =]|`|NZKiSfVOaa	Go to your doctors and tell them that the spots wont go and have had them for about a year, (spots should clear up in a couple of days/ week or two) and they will prescribe you a cream to put on.  The cream, if used the right way and the right amount of times, should clear up the spots no problem!   If you have spots, im guessing you have oily skin? make sure you take ALL your make up off, use toner and use moistiouriser. If you dont have oily skin and have dry skin, make sure you use moistiouriser at least two times a day (morning and night) and as many other times you want.  If you have a full fringe/side fringe, make sure you clip it up if its greasy or when ever you dont really need it down.  Good luck (yn)  (:|`|eZDoQPg8aa	Try the Acne Free products.  You can get them at Sam's Club or Wal-Mart and probably some other stores.  Not terribly expensive and they seem to work well.  They are making a difference with my son's skin.  Easy to do, cleanser, toner and repair lotion.  We did add a more aggressive scrubbing cleanser a couple of times a week to help with the flaky skin issue.|`|auV6OLVDaa	its ACNE =)|`|HwaAAIOEaa	Try going to a dermatologist!

DKiftd4Naa	These stores rock and are super unique. I guarantee, unlike mall clothes, no one will have or have seen the stuff you'll wear.    Try:  http://www.urbanoutfitters.com  http://www.gentlefawn.com/  http://www.indiestylefile.com    http://www.designbyhumans.com/  http://www.Karmaloop.com  http://www.zappos.com  http://www.thegiantpeach.com    http://www.trueloveandfalseidols.com  http://www.80spurple.com  http://www.threadless.com  www.grnappletree.com/  www.revolveclothing.com/  www.stereohype.com/    look at them all, they're all different. Not all of them are expensive.|`|xdeWSxJ4aa	Try http://www.forever21.com    They have some very "fashion forward" and trendy clothing, for a good price.    Look to magazines like Vogue, Nylon etc. for new looks. With Vogue, don't copy the looks directly, because they are usually very difficult to copy without looking ridiculous.  Look in Vogue for inspiration in terms of trends, colours, cuts and patterns etc.  Look in magazines like Nylon (aimed at young adults - sort of 16-25) for cool ideas on how to wear clothes.  Teen Vogue also sometimes offers ways to alter your current clothes to suit the current season's trends.|`|AA10702820	Just be yourself and be your own inspiration. Don't look at magazines, people, or websites. Then when someone wonders how you got your style you won't have to worry about them stealing it cuz it comes to you naturally and effortlessly.
8OVEjPg1aa	I would recommend regular bikini underwear just to be on the safe side. When you run, your body will move differently than it does when you stand still or walk, so a thong could end up rubbing you the wrong way.    But if you really want to be sure, just go for a jog now. That way you know for future reference and get stretched for tomorrow. hehe.=] Good luck on the run!|`|d1d16f976ab4af78c06d3dc29088aab7aa	I disagree with most answers given. I use to jog all the time *3 months pregnant right now so I dont anymore*  but when I did, I always wore a Thong.     Bikini's or Brief's are not comfortable and boyshorts do ride up in areas not comfortable.     Thong as long as it is not toooo tight and uncomfortable to start with will be perfectly fine.|`|FklngtvCaa	You're in middle school?!  Wear regular underwear.

Its reaaallllyyyyy uncomfy and go with breifs cuz boy shorts can ride up easy.
9VB4uWhMaa	You need some sort of cleansing product to clean your face.  Saying cleansing products are all gimmicks, is like saying soap is a gimmick, it's simply not true.      You don't have to spend a lot of money on skin care.  Get some Clearasil Ultra Daily Face Wash and use it twice a day.    Don't use the scrub every day, it will irritate your skin and make it worse!    A lot of acne is caused by lack of vitamins.  Try taking "Chelated Zinc", it must be "Chelated Zinc" or it won't work.  Take 50-100 mgs every day and you should see a huge improvement in your skin.  There are other vitamins you could take that would help clear your skin and you can find them below.  http://www.alteracne.com/vitamin-treatme...|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Mix nutmeg powder with a little unboiled milk and apply on acne or pimples and wash after an hour this remedy when done once or twice a week for some time will not leave any acne marks on the skin .

Also, use a hot rag on your face for about 5 minutes  day this helps reduce acne. PLEASE stop popping pimples because this causes the scarring.

It wont' clog pores  Acne Clear Up - Aspirin. Crush 2-3 aspirin, mix with a bit of water to make a paste, scrub on your face, leave on 15 min and rinse off. Its about $1 for 60 tablets.     check out www.makeupalley.com.

3Yfp3QUfaa	Well, up until I was 6 I had really light blonde hair, like really light!!!!!!! Then over about 2 years my hair got to be really dark brown and still is. I have never died my hair either. Though, over the summer my hair gets blonde, and then when it goes to Winter again, dark brown. I think it is just that your hair is changing as you get older, there is a chance it is sunlight. I don't think that there is anything wrong, its just a simple change.    hope i helped =p|`|XOVJ2U3Kaa	Well its probally the sun. And when you get older your hair can change color too.

qL8f3rSsaa	I have never found one at Marshalls or Tjmax. Even though I have never looked for Longchamp specifically, I still have never come across one. Sorry!|`|HusPtzz9aa	Sorry, but I have never seen a Longchamp purse at stores like Marshalls or TJMAXX.    This is probably because these stores hold items that doesn't get sold in department stores like Nordstrom. Since people mainly go to department stores to buy purses, I suggest you go to stores like Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's, or Lord&Taylor. Marshalls and TJMAXX usually hold purses that are from lower labels, but ocassionally they do hold some designers like Dooney or Coach. So, you can still check Marshalls once in a while, but chances are pretty low!

C0HZ8ZB4aa	It will limit you to wearing collared or polo neck tops, or having your hair down if you have thick hair. As long as you can hide it then it's not visible, it just depends if you mind having that limitation. I really want a back of the neck tattoo but I'm going to wait until I'm in my career and see how accepted it is before having it, just because I don't always want to wear high necks and if I'm having a bad hair day I like to scrape it into a ponytail! But it's up to you. I suppose if it was very small then you could even wear a plaster over it for work, I don't think many employers would mind that as long as it was discreet. Glad to hear somebody actually considering the effect tattoos have on their life before rushing out and getting one... too many kids getting hand/face/throat tattoos before they've even left school and signing themselves up to a lifetime of shitty earnings!    (by the way by plaster I mean band aid if you're american!)|`|WLuEIwp5aa	I would say so, but I also hate having long hair, so it would be visible all the time unless I wore a turtleneck.    However, I consider it pretty visible, regardless of how long someone has their hair.  Even if your hair is to your butt, all it takes is a bit of wind and your tattoo is there for everyone to see.  I won't say you'll never get a job with one there, but I don't think you'll have quite as many opportunities.    If you still really want a tattoo in that general area, you could always get it at the bottom of your neck, where it meets your shoulders and back, so that you can cover it with a collared shirt and you don't have to depend on your hair staying a certain way to cover it up.  You could also wait until you get into the career you want and have a stable job at a company that doesn't mind tattoos in the workplace.    In the end, though, it's your decision.  If you really want that tattoo on your neck, get it, but be prepared to deal with the consequences.|`|WMhhmWBWaa	i want one there too. ii think you should get it. =)|`|B29boGPcaa	not really, if you wear your hair down all the time no one will ever know haha. however, it'll hurt like a *****! way more than tattoos on other spots.|`|rOiIBmd1aa	i want one there too, i think its a really sweet place to get one|`|uv0Y7Ar8aa	Unless you regularly wear your hair above the neck line where it would show then no this is not a visible place and most all jobs as long as it is not offensive would have no problems with this.|`|auV6OLVDaa	nah, if you want to cover it, leave your hair out and where high collared tops....man i want to get one too behind the neck..BUT WHAT? im thinking about my aunt (god mother) initials..|`|SH5bSBDtaa	sounds nice,  you can hide it with your hair/scarf anyhow|`|NBK3s2LVaa	The whole entire back of my neck is tattooed and let me tell you it is a very painful spot to get tattooed because it hits right on your spine if your not one for pain you might want to consider that :) I have tattoos in other places and none of them hurt as bad but hey I think the pain is worth it but not all people think that way

jEZbYZwMaa	If you wore them with skinny jeans they'd look really cute and a lot less stripperish. If i saw a girl wearing them, I'd think 'wow, i wish i could walk in those.' Oh and trust me, if I could wear those.. I would. But honestly I think they only look stripperish because they were on the playboy website, I can see myself finding them cute if I saw them anywhere else. If you practice walking in them at home maybe that would help? Good luck!|`|0QTCiCf8aa	I would wear them when you 2 were alone... I would think that girl should be on a pole if I saw them.... sorry Im sure your man thought the same thing...Thats why he bought them!!! :)|`|MLvwZ7uAaa	I would think that you were kinda desperate for attention. I'm really sorry to say that, but if you're worried about wearing them, why don't you just go for a more natural style? Good luck! -Lola P.|`|VihV4Troaa	those are not meant to be worn to show off in town unless you want to be looked at as a prostitute.|`|XNBMzuxbaa	Hun, those aren't meant to be worn outside. Its playboy, maybe to a costume party but not out on town. Your not a trophy. He should be more respectful. If I saw somone wearing those I would think they were kinda trashy. I don't want to sound mean. Those are ment for the two of you not for everyone to see.  Plus the look hard to walk in lol!|`|JQA1mnGfaa	Your guy bought you those for a reason. Did you notice that he bought them from the playboy shop! Duhh, he wants to show you off in those, so he can show everybody, oh look I made my girlfriend wear these stripper heels and she did it.    Don't wear them. Don't degrade yourself like that.    Because the first thing I thought of when I saw those, like many people will think when you go around town in them, is that your a whore. No offense. This is girl to girl advice. I know your 19 and your young and you want to look sexy, but that's more trashy and hoe-ish.    You asked for an honest opinion.|`|HwrnJNBFaa	wow...  i hope you don't die in those|`|DAyBFx60aa	Well first you have to get used to wearing them so put them on everytime your inside and start practicing and if you are very clumsy you want to be near railings to help you if you fall. And when your practicing keep your head up high and smile you want to look a little flirty make yourself seem confident but you don't want to go over board with being too sexy you don't want your man to be jealous! Also, i would think you were very confident cause i wouldn't be able to pull that off. Just make sure not to look to sexy because if girls saw you like that they would think you would be like a boy toy or try to steal their guys. Hope it helped!|`|92TC2V3daa	I would keep practicing with them around the house until you were comfortable with them. I would also not wear anything too short with these, maybe jeans or something else. That way you're not looking too hoochy. As far as what other people would think, I would tell you that you had nice shoes. Seriously, I like them and who really cares what everyone thinks? The only thing you have to worry about is looking like a prostitute so don't wear any short shorts or mini skirts.|`|aXEmVsxJaa	I am a fashion design major and I see girls wearing shoes like this ALL the time.... and they do not look stripperish at all. you just have too look kinda innocent in the way u dress when wearing these. just make sure not to show any leg and very little cleavage and you shouldnt even get dirty looks from ppl. In the fashion world, it you show leg, ur not supposed to show arm and very little cleavage otherwise you look like you belong on a street corner. I really like the skinny jean idea... maybe black jeans with a bright/fun colored top?  Also, with the skinny jeans and high heels, i wouldnt wear a tight fitted top.  I am hoping this helps you!  a top similar to this may look really great....  if not just remember not to have too much of a formed fit.   this top here is sheer so its a playful without being overdone and trashy
QsbB6vkoaa	i think that instead of asking here, you should ask your hair stylist, because what works for some may not work for others, although i don't think you should get layers, because since you have curly hair it'll get really frizzy. but a face frame will look cute. and i would suggest you  get the hair cut that Jennifer Aniston has the second season of friends, just a little bit longer. that's a cute hair cut.|`|VVJyaQdCaa	get choppy layers put in :)
AaYEgDwWaa	looks like mascara too me love.|`|DF22BQ3yaa	Yes.|`|jKBDXgvZaa	I don't think so...they are long...but mascara can definitely do that...the more coats you apply the longer the tips get. They also aren't really thick, which is why i don't think they are fake - surely if you are gonna fake gorgeous lashes - they would be long AND THICK?!|`|SlLhUL6zaa	Is it just me or are they both really sweaty.  And I don't think so; her lashes could naturally be like that. If she were wearing fake ones, they would look more dramatic.|`|pCwIokI0aa	I think if they were fake, that they would look longer.  She probably just has several coats of mascara on.|`|9LIBiBTGaa	yeah|`|Hz0sVre3aa	no she just has a lot of masscara on.|`|as9RDbJaaa	Maybe.   Or just alot of Mascara.   She might just have really long eyelashes.|`|0x1YfTcMaa	maybe, it's maybelline ;)    haha|`|iUhIEz03aa	yup|`|0mAeM1zGaa	It doesn't look like it, she already has dark lashes and she is just wearing alot of mascara.

IU2Znlv3aa	Unfortunately yes your nose (and ears) never stops growing.  Your eyes however stay the same size from birth!|`|rOiIBmd1aa	eek i hope not mines big enough!|`|o6hKaeMxaa	Yes this is true. Your nose and ears keep growing forever.  See, when regular bone cells mature, they get a signal from your body and become immune to the human growth hormone. But your nose and ears are made of cartilage, not bone. They never become immune to the growth hormone and continue to grow.  Don't worry about it! Your nose grows so slowly, there is no way you can possibly tell the difference, even after a few years.|`|eW0KifqHaa	Haha yeah!! Weird I know, but not a myth. Have you ever observed old people's noses? Most of them are way bigger (and lumpier it seems) than what you would see on a teens face for example. That perplexed me for a long time before i found out that they never stop growing.|`|6Yjvtf2laa	its not like extremely noticable for everyone  but your nose and your ears will grow through out your life.

1ioI2py4aa	yer i think i agree. im the ssam eage and i started wearing my make up at 11. maybe a teeny bit younger. but i used to cake it on. then i looked at myself in the mirror one day and agreed that i did look completely stupid. so i toned it down to just a tiny bit and i think that that is what parents sould allow|`|Q6x1gSlKaa	i understand the concern about her looking bad in makeup, but if you get someone to help her learn how to apply it she'll be fine. also, tell her that, she's allowed to wear it but only an amount that YOU feel comfortable with. and if she doesnt like that, then reminder her that you could be denying it flat out. the thing is all girls go through that phase of over doing it and thinking it looks good, but if someon helps her then she wont have to because she'lll already know what she's doing.|`|PfP8LSF6aa	Well I think you should let her wear makeup at 15 or 16. But anywho.. Just give her like kiddie makeup they do make it. Like very light lip gloss, no eyeliner, no mascara. Just lipgloss, and a little powder. That's it. When I was younger I never even asked about makeup, cuz I never wore it, and I still don't. But my face is like really clean soo.. I do see some girls though when they take there makeup off they look funny and not themselves.|`|A7ovwP94aa	I think at 13 or 14 years a little mascara and a coloured lipbalm is fine any more than this is too much for a child and they start to look like clowns|`|nntQUfl1aa	my mom drew the line at high school. which makes perfect sense. no makeup until high school. then only a little not too much.|`|IphovWxaaa	wth is the question?|`|cqEYllm9aa	it's really up to you to decide if and what she can wear. if she's 14 then it is alright if she wants to wear a bit of makeup, it's part of growing up. A little lip gloss or mascara or powder is alright but just make sure she doesn't go overboard because after all she is only 14.|`|G965la4uaa	Kids should be able to wear makeup! WHAT is wrong with that? nothing at all! its not like they are going out and doing drugs. Why should you have to allow or forbid them their right of expression. Maybe they want more confidence or to look prettyyyyy! let them! i use makeup since i was young and i have just gotten better and better! and i btw im not out there doing drugs|`|LlOzTmgzaa	i was probably in 5th or 6th grade when i started to experiment with makeup. i think its important to let kids experiment but i wouldnt go as far as 6 coats of mascara and stuff like that. buy her neutral/light colors from eye shadow and lipgloss. thats what i would start with. and then if she wanted to add more maybe get her some eyeliner (go for the ones that are hypoallergenic incase she reacts) hope this helps!|`|XavbWtU1aa	Don't let her wear ALOT of makeup.  But let her wear some.  Most 14 year old girls wear makeup... I would know.  But it doesn't look good if you wear alot. So tell her she can wear like: mascara, coverup and a little eyeshadow. but not really dark heavy stuff.    GOod Luckk![:|`|63a62e9d03ddedba613f51cf09e6e15daa	But what if she does not learn it could start attracting the wrong ppl besides kids at that age don't even rly need make up they have fresh young skin makeup will only spoil it    Btw I don't think it's wrong to wear a little makeup around that age it's just isn't very necessary|`|yr1685V1aa	and yr question is|`|aNfGqkrpaa	Well, I say wait till your daughter is in middle school for sure.  Most girls go for it in 7th or 8th grade, and manyy look fine.  If you are her mom then show her how to apply everything naturally and corectly.     As far as how much, yes we all learn, and yes we all do and need to learn, but really, their is a line.  My parents don't care, but I don't wear blue eyeshadow and 10 coats of black mascara and eyeliner.  It's common sense.  If she goes overboard just say "That looks a little heavy and is starting to overpower your eyes, honey" or something.  But good for you- not many parents give their daughters this liberty(:

2wBfPVRAaa	Here's what I do for the beaded jewelry that I make and sell:    1. Use a punch to punch out cardstock or thicker paper (you can get really cute papers at scrapbooking stores) into the shape of a tag.  Here is the punch that I use:  http://www.michaels.com/art/online/displ...    2. Use a tiny paper hole puncher to add a hole to pull string through.    3. Decorate the back of the tag with your store logo, or something pretty that represents your store or items.  I use a stamp, but you could use stickers or little paper cut-outs - use your imagination!    4. Add the price (and possibly the name of the item - you don't want people to switch price tags).    5. String the tag and pin (or otherwise attach) the tag to your item!    Good luck to you!|`|t24aL6qVaa	I'm not sure if I can help you, but you can probably have them specially made- maybe you could create a design and then get them printed (not sure if this is what you had in mind, but I thought I'd give it a shot). Also, you'll probably get better answers in the Hobbies & Crafts section... :D|`|CkIeCNS4aa	I love this shape of tag http://familycrafts.about.com/library/pr... and if you can afford it, buy the precut kind from the craft store that you just have to punch out.  I like the paper bag color, but creme or flecked white cardstock would also look good.  You can attach with hemp or thin chain which you can purchase at a jewelry supply store.  You could print prices/descriptions on clear Avery labels or hand write them.
ph4Htg02aa	There is a cream called Mederma that gets rid of acne scars. You can get it at your local drug store.|`|unlQZyfNaa	nope sorry, nothing does|`|JIel7eM5aa	Yeah, stuff actually does.   Most moisturizers won't help, but a moisturizer with cocoa butter in it is great because cocoa butter is a natural ingredient that evens skin tone and gets rid of scars.

e7UOFx1faa	don't blow dry you hair, let it air dry. also try pantene rehydrating curls shampoo and conditioner. then after brushing your hair when it it still wet put in sunsilk curly hair creme. then style you hair. don't blowdry or once it is dry don't comb it. hope this helps.      could you please help me if you have the time. http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...

It comes in liquid, cream, powder, and mousse and  in different shades for different skin tones.    This is a liquid one:  http://www.condenast.co.uk/imagelib/320x...

If you a teen or older woman you can wear foundation it's dosent not I REPEAT dose not reuin your skin. if your wearing makeup at night Take it off and you should have no Problems|`|fIb6zHXxaa	Foundation is supposed to be make-up that evens out your skin tone. If you're a teenager, I recommend you not to use foundation, it's wrecks up your skin and we have beautiful skin anyways.|`|YgPYv4OPaa	foundation is the most amazing thing ever created ! :]  it makes your skintone even , covers most inperfections , and it just makes your skin look amazing !   i couldnt live without it |`|X2BMymt8aa	Foundation is used to even out your skin, especially if you have blemishes and spots. It can be very useful to cover up spots and it makes your skin look smooth. The only annoying thing is that if you touch it, it comes off easy and you can't get it wet (because it will come off too). It doesn't harm your skin though so nothing bad will happen if you use it!|`|AA11447210	Foundation, also just called "makeup" by some, is the base you put on your face to even the tone, hide blemishes and imperfections, etc. Some people use it, some prefer not to.    If you use it, you'd apply your blush, powder, eye makeup, etc on top of the foundation.    I prefer not to use it unless I'm having a splotchy skin day, but I used to use it regularly.    There are ones for oily skin, dry skin, etc and various shades to try to match your natural skin tone.|`|CbpJfrhoaa	Theres really a lot you could do. Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting cheap and trying out several products.This is a good review website at http://www.brandsmakeup.com visit and browse the reviews.

JIel7eM5aa	Clean & Clear Oil-Absorbing Sheets are greaaat.  OCCASIONALLY I will see makeup transfer to the sheets, but it's not hardly a problem at all.  It absorbs oil great, and I use them at school everyday during lunch to keep my skin and makeup from wearing off and getting greasy.  It also never caused me any breakouts.  I don't normally like Clean & Clear, but this is a great product.  (;|`|uvWuVWb1aa	I used to use the Neutrogena ones. They didn't take my makeup off. Make sure you pat, don't rub.|`|7f217ccda43c76f8c4728b2cdf19d4dfaa	They say they don't but they do. If you rub it that is. If you just pat the sheets on your nose/ t-zone then your make up won't come off. I use the clean and clear ones. I also have the Clinique superfit foundation and it makes a huge difference!    I hope that helps. Good Luck.|`|bFT9EinFaa	I've never used the Biore or Clean & Clear sheets, but I have used the ones by Avon, and I figure they are basically the same thing. I really love them! They don't take off your make-up as long as you just blot with them. Just press down and then lift back off. If you rub it, it can smear and take some of it off however.
A7ovwP94aa	Maybe the powder you use to set it is not very good.Try a better brand. Use a primer first and apply with a foundation brushe.|`|JIel7eM5aa	Well, let me just say before I tossed my foundation and got a new one (Sally Hansen's Airbrush Foundation...love it, lasts all day, doesn't rub off, and great coverage), and used a Mario Badescu facial spray to set my makeup, I had the SAME problem.  At gym, our uniform collars are so tight around my neck that I always had a rim of tan makeup around it.   It WAS emberassing.  But yeah, I recommend both those products.  The facial spray is a MUST-HAVE.   You can get any foundation you like, but that is one that worked for me.    http://mariobadescu.com/productDetail.as...    Perfect! And cheap!  (;|`|es3feuhxaa	use moisturizer first and then use a foundation primer (revlon and smashbox sell them) and then apply your foundation.  it will make your foundation go on smoother and not smear :)|`|8ae38a2ac6a77dd4a25ba0e15d91e256aa	have you tried using mineral powder foundation? it transfers a little bit less. also, use a non oil based foundation. i've found that as the day progresses and my face builds more oil and my face looks more shiny and make up transfers more easily. by periodically blotting my face with a paper towel, i keep this down to a minimum. they make oil blotting papers-but a tissue or paper towel works just as well and is more cost effective. just because make up transfers on your fingers, that does not mean it will do so on fabric. perhaps you should give it a test run at home.|`|F7Ma8tZpaa	You should use Cover Girl foundation. That is what I use and I love it, it never smears or anything. It's also affordable.|`|Elaimr9qaa	i know this sounds weird because when one of my friends to me i thought i was silly & it didnt work. but i tried it anyway & it keeps my make-up on! spray hairspray over your foundation, NOT too much. x
DhYEnkONaa	Use a dandruff shampoo (i suggest not head and shoulders; it doesn't work all that great).  when you're washing your hair,  scratch gently at your scapl to remove the dry skin, try and moisturize your scalp!  do not scratch it if not necessary when your hair is dry, you will create more.|`|E4X6EaWoaa	I'd suggest taking showers often, using a shampoo made to reduce dandruff, and when in the shower, scrubbingg your scalp with your fingers/nails. Do not scratch your head, just rub into your scalp, this should help reduce it. That is all that I do. Oh, Also, make sure the shampoo is fully washed out of your hair. Sometimes, if the shampoo stays in your hair it drys and produces flakes.|`|OHfUqAf7aa	NIZORAL is what I use. It helps and works WAY better than Head and Shoulders. All my friends and family use it and it works for everyone. It's even recomended by my docter and around 12$. Use it. It works miracles and I promise you that you won't regret it. Good luck! :)|`|owCnzoNeaa	head & shoulders shampoo works wonders (C)|`|CzS1EiV9aa	Shave your head.|`|XuFI3ttiaa	ewwww, duede wash ur hair
auV6OLVDaa	you wanna be a porn star?|`|BRIeyc8Raa	my sister got it done. they cut right below her bust line. (the line would be covered by the breasts in the future) to prepare...she showered. it took one day to complete and about a week to feel normal. her scars are gone now. she paid only 24, 000 since the doctor is a friend of my moms.|`|KEWbsDTIaa	I dont have them buttttttt price depends on where you live and your doctor. It's up to the doctor on how much they want to make off of it.     Ofcourse they hurt because it's a foreign object in your body and some women complain of the weight on their chest. when they first wake up they say it feels like a stack of books on top of their chest.     recovery depends on your own body.    age doesn't matter if you ask me. If you have insecurities about it than age doesn't matter. Over time the insecurities became less important but they will always be there.|`|yxKb6g9xaa	You need to first decide if you really want to spend the money on it.  Then you need to find a doctor and ask him all of those questions because each doctor is going to tell you something different to expect, prepare for, and different things to do after.    I used Dr. Weiner in Houston, Texas.  I paid $3600 all together.  I couldn't take asprin or any other medicine that is a blood thinner 2 weeks prior to surgery and I couldn't tan or be in direct sunlight a week before.  You have to be 18 no matter what to get this surgery, unless it is for reconstruction.  The surgery didn't hurt me one bit, but I've heard from some of my friends that it's the worst pain they have ever been in.  It takes a year to fully recover, but in a week I was back out doing what I always did.  You can't swim, take a bath (showers are fine), tan, or anything like that for 6 weeks after because the scars are still healing.  I have no regrets and can still breast feed because I got my implants under the muscle.  I went underneath my breast for the incision site because it has the lowest chance for getting infected and its the easiest for the doctor.  I had to massage mine once an hour every hour for the first week, once every 3 hours the 2nd through the 4th week, and at least 4 times a day for the first 3 months.  Hope this helped :]
TKVQ2TXRaa	Put your hair in a ponytail.  I do every night, but a loose one.  Then shower in the morning.  And blow dry it.  Because my hair gets greasy over night..  SO I shower int he morning.  Your hair looks prettier that way :)|`|VSCYTZ38aa	Try getting a silk pillow case and pulling it into a ponytail. and then get over it. it's hair, it can be washed and redone|`|4tynRVpzaa	Don't sleep or shave your hair. It's up to you.|`|jez0O0bXaa	Put it up in a scrunchie or elastic holder without any metal on it.  You can also twist it up on top and hold with large bobby pins. Also satin pillowcases help.|`|d0lye0cyaa	Silk pillows are supposed to be better for your hair than cotton which apparently does what it does to your hair.  I would maybe try a leave-in conditioner.
UY6mkCk2aa	haha, that sounds like fun ! umm, wear like really girlY tight T-shirts with a mini and put lots of gloss and eyeliner on! ;D After this little makeover, I hope you realize how difficult dressing up EVERY SINGLE DAY really is!|`|WNfAMR7Eaa	i wish my guy freinds would allow me to do that!!!!!|`|on9xLWegaa	You should do your hair in pigtails, wear makeup like Tammy Fay, and wear petticoats.|`|lXaAFIHfaa	Men are men for a reason. Stop falling for this whole feminization of our male population. Men and woman are different for a reason. Enjoy being a man and stop letting woman push you around!!|`|u1FlCXL0aa	r u serious? wow  any ways straighten your hair  wear a skift and a tank top|`|afee0e29771cb18093e76307e67462e8aa	You should just not do it at all, no way dude, why the hell would you even do that?
0A47o6yNaa	I don't think it is possible. Go to the salon and get natural highlights put in? Or even get a shade lighter hair dye than your current colour, and put it all over your hair so it looks lighter and fresher.|`|Twq7efhQaa	You can do things to bring out the natural highlights in your hair without going to the salon. These steps wont result in dramatic hair color changes, but they will help your hair appear shinier, more lustrous and healthy. The first step toward bringing out your natural highlights is taking care of your hair and making sure it is adequately moisturized. That said, you should use a deep conditioner at least once per week to help reinfuse your hair with life. Be sure you select a conditioner formulated for your hair type. For example, if you have hair that is already oily, youll want to use a lighter conditioner and apply it mostly to the ends of your hair.     You can also consider an egg bath. Eggs help moisturize hair because they contain lecithin. Simply beat an egg, apply it to your hair when dry and then cover with a plastic bag. Allow the egg to sit for about 15 minutes before rinsing in cool water.     Excessive blow-drying dries hair and creates a dull appearance. This inhibits your natural highlights from coming out. Try to blow-dry your hair rarely. When you do blow-dry, use a low heat setting, and consider a leave on conditioner to help protect your hair from the heat. There are also many hair products specially designed to protect hair when drying.     You can prevent unsightly highlights or greenish coloring to your hair by protecting your hair when swimming in chlorinated swimming pools. Consider using a conditioner and a swim cap on your hair to protect it from the water. Dont forget to wash your hair immediately after swimming.|`|jez0O0bXaa	Lemon Juice.|`|gwY8qkszaa	Watered down lemon juice; apply it before you shower.
RWt78jE5aa	My first month using it yes I noticed a huge difference, I had really bad acne, but after that it just seemed like it wasn't working at all, so I switched to something different.|`|BRIeyc8Raa	it depends on how your skin reacts to it. while it gave my cousin a clear face, i ended up with rashes and breakouts. so did my boyfriend. it all depends.|`|tTLsOStmaa	Yes it does; but you have to order it ...  They sell the exact same thing at Walmart.  It is called acnefree it works the same as proactive :)|`|2I5XqMDzaa	nope. ur skin gets addicted to it and goes all gross when u forget to wash it even once! try tea tree oil it works great|`|4NEx12Sxaa	well my friend ahs used it for years. and it starts working after a year of using it, the bad thing about it tho...when she doesnt clean her face one day she breaks out.|`|OapXbjbSaa	works great for me!!!!!!!!!|`|fMnrAhtiaa	worked on some of my galfriends, but not on me.|`|AA10407790	Yes it does work I have been using it for 2 years and it has helped my skin.|`|hEC87Vj8aa	it doesnt work on everybody's face like they said because it works on me but not my sister. You should try clean and clear acne kit. it really works|`|mPMFd6CFaa	i used it for about 8 months. you have to be consistent throughout. skipping a day or two causes your skin to break out. well mine did :/ it's okay if you're a persistent person. i get lazy at night though, oh! and make sure not to use too much of the moisturizer. it dries out your skin. oh and my acne was semi-severe. a few red bumps here and there. good luck hope it works :)|`|G965la4uaa	LISTEN:  with proactive, if you use it all of the time, your acne will most likely go away. But note, everyone has different skin types. Also, it only works for the time you are using it. As soon as you stop using it, you go right back to having acne. I know this from MANY experiences.  it may get worst before it gets better depending on your skin! I really reccomend you go to the dermatologist and get a prescription and in the generic brand because they will work and not be SOOO expensive|`|oDbcaGj4aa	It didnt work for me.   But Proactive only works for certain people.  For some people it works amazing right away, but for others  it doesn't work at all. I guess you'll never know until you try.  I used to have acne too. Neutrogena worked for me.   I used this thing called,  Oil Free Acne Wash.  And it worked right away.    It Looks Like This:  http://a1624.g.akamai.net/f/1624/580/1d/...|`|nlQdROaKaa	dryed my skin out bad, the lotion didnt help, I had slighty moderate acne. I stopped using it as it helped no more then store bought medication and dryed my skin out just as bad, all depends on skin type hun.    What I reccomend is neutrogena 2% benzoyl cream and face wash and a good lotion w/o oil and fragrances. Dont use wash cloth use your hands, wash your pillow cases every week, try not to touch the face, use warm-hot water to open pores and cleanse, when done use cold water to close them tight.    Oh and the best thing usually is just time as it will go away like mine did which sucks, unless you can afford expensive dr visits and medication.
DF22BQ3yaa	MAC is the best place to go.|`|AaYEgDwWaa	yes I belive MAC Concealer in studio finsih is water proof|`|1GR8gcZyaa	Make Up For Ever face & body foundation might work. Its waterproof, but it doesn't have FULL coverage. Its best to check it out in the store before buying.  You can get them at Sephora or at selected Shoppers Drug Mart Beauty Boutiques.

Its really easy and the curls look great!    http://www.simplystraighthair.com/flat-i...
J18lftqTaa	I had the same problem. Theres not really a way to scrunch te top, but try curling small peices with a really small curling iron. You also need to add a few through out your hair to make it blend. You can also put the sides, pinned back towards the top or pull back your bangs and secure with a clip.|`|Dh5CUjmkaa	The key is to have most of the product on the roots, not the ends of your hair. I would only use mouse and apply it starting at the roots, working it to the ends. I would then use a diffuser, which is a tool that you put on your blow dryer, then flip my head so my hair is upside down. then dry while it is upside down. Make sure that the roots are completely dry before you flip your hair right side up. I would then use hairspray. Flip your hair upside down again and spray the underside especially at the roots. Then flip hair up and spray from the top. You may even have to tease the hair on top at the root a little before you spray to ensure it has some volume at the root. They have these neat little things called bumps which hide under the top layer of hair to give you the volume or similar to the bee hive look at the top of your head. I have short hair now, but if I had long hair again, I would be buying those. The key to having wavy from roots to ends is to use your products and tools in the right way. Good luck.|`|O8UEqa8vaa	this happens because your hair weighs too much. if  you get your hair cut in layers it will help it weigh less and be more curly.|`|IrdcAhnFaa	I am not positive, but it could be that your hair either won't take a wave/curl or whatever you are putting in your hair is weighing it down.

Keep in mind that it'll be like $5 - $10 off, so you're  not getting much of a deal anyways.|`|9dr0BZIbaa	Aritzia hardly have sales, but when they do, they are not much cheaper than the original price.|`|OpTfXzJEaa	usually when they are trying to get rid of the winter clothes so probably in the spring because that's when they try to get the new clothes.
LUg9dgb5aa	I love the first link dress.  That is so cute. It's really simple,  but cute at the same time. You  could pair it with basically anything  too, and i think it would suit you  based on your description on yourself.  Good luck. (:|`|IutA7paGaa	I love the one for Charolotte Russe the best.

OujhXy2yaa	My hair always seems smoother at least when I wash it the night before.  and a trim will help with fly-aways and frizz, I don't know much about products but Paul Mitchell's Super Skinny Serum works really well for me|`|j6PrOaZgaa	you should get a trim bc healthy hair lies flatter. wear your hood on your hoodie when  you walk into school and then take it off when you get inside. texas humidity can get bad and thats what i do and my hair always looks the same as when i straightened it.  i think my hair looks more frizzy when i take showers in the morning and then straighten it. i take showers at night. so maybe try it for a few days and see if you see a difference :)

z03u3JGXaa	Lemon Juice will RETARD the loss of color - The 'Acidity' of the juice will keep the cuticle (The outer layer) closed TIGHT preventing color loss.    Try using a Tbs. of Baking Soda in 8 oz. warm water and pour through dry hair this is mildly alkaline and will OPEN the cuticle layer allowing the dye to wash away more quickly - Follow with shampoo.    If you need it removed more quickly get L'Oreal? EFFASOL or Clairol UNCOLOR Powder from the local beauty supply and mix with warm water and conditioner. Or Clairol METALEX? (Check the links below)    Of the suggestions below Clairol? UNCOLOR? Liquid is the most gentle - But may need 2-3 applications to remove all color. METALEX is more efficient but still gentle to hair and scalp. The Powder Removers will remove color in 1 application but you need to watch them CAREFULLY so mix them with CONDITIONER and WATER ONLY (No Peroxide or Developer)    Hope This Helps.    Good-Luck!!|`|pFxNunMxaa	No but wash your hair with dishwashing soap  its proven to remove color|`|bT9SXnYQaa	I don't think so.  Semiperm should wash out within 6-8 weeks.

Hope they help :)  x|`|skWN7jWHaa	no,but vinegar will help|`|c98c60d71dbb85f0335e5c7fc391ddd3aa	yes if you wrap your hair in plastic wrap after applying the lemon juice and leave it on your hair for about an hour it should remove the dye|`|227cc8d6f28831125ea24c629158b6c1aa	Blecch! I would want to get rid of it too!  If you add some lemon juice to shampoo and kinda leave it sit a while.  It will lift some of the color.  But if it is that bad, you might need something stronger.  If you mix equal parts of professional developer (peroxide...from a beauty shop) and shampoo, then leave it on like a half hour, it will lift better.  But if it were me, and my hair wasnt totally fried, I would go get another light color hair dye and undo it!

QsbB6vkoaa	i don't think there is a magical way of making hair grow, just try taking good care of it. i suggest  getting a hair trim every month  using good shampoo and conditioner  taking a multivitamin  sleep well  drink lots of water  deep condition your hair every week  massage your scalp often  don't torture your hair.  and have patience.|`|Na3C1sPtaa	get pantene beautiful lengths|`|9Eq9pozbaa	There is nothing.  Getting it trimmed every six months will not effect the hair growing out of your scalp to make your hair grow faster.  Nor will extra conditioner or special shampoo.    You just have to wait, I know it sucks. :(|`|YI7xsvGYaa	taking vitamins is good for hair growth. try the pre-natal ones, they're really complete!|`|6gPTv8lOaa	start taking biotin. u can get at in the vitamin section at walmart.. i dont really know how much its gunna cost but im sure they have it. thts what im gunna start doing. and i know wut ur goin thru. my mom made my stylist cut my hair real short and its been 2 years and my hair is still short. but im gunna start takin biotin.. and the one tht said to take pre-natle vitamins jst ignore tht becuz if ur not pregnant it can be harmfulll.|`|55e1c8c7878524ef01bce88b395660b6aa	lol i wanna kno the same thing.  but just take everyone's advice. =]

UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.    However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.    My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com    What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.      Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|zt70x6NYaa	I love bare minerals.  I only have occasional breakouts and it covers great but also I've noticed that I have less breakouts, if any during some months.  And b/c it's natural it doesn't matter if you forget to wash it off at night!!   Bare Minerals sounds perfect for you.  Buy the starter kit b/c they have everything you need to start.|`|iPGcOe6Laa	i like bare minerals|`|B29boGPcaa	bare minerals is great coverage, i have a few pimples but mostly scarring and it covers it up great and looks really natural. and for your oily skin use a facial cleanser with salicylic acid in it--like the neutrogena oil-free acne wash (the grapefruit one i use and love it smells heavenly lmao). if your acne gets really severe you can go to the dermatologist and get oral medication. birth control isn't the only pill to help acne! :) good luck! x|`|7f217ccda43c76f8c4728b2cdf19d4dfaa	I am 19 too. I have used the bare minerals and it made me break out. I have super oily skin, so I use the Clinique Superfit foundation. It's more coverage than the almost make up but it makes such a huge difference at the end of the day.    Hope that helps! Good Luck!
al5PZJoyaa	Omg I have always wondered this!  Good question!    I think they use shampoo even though they don't need it.  Then they use some wax for shine! (:|`|BrEUh8U5aa	What do you think?

Your best option would be to dye the shoe.  Many shoe shops sell different color dyes, take your shoe with you to get a color that matches.|`|1eUe9BkOaa	Haha. smart    Black sharpie  Color over "stain'|`|7r53ftKWaa	use a permanent marker to colour it back and repeat repeat repeat|`|AQo9Zuwwaa	Bleach is permanent... sorry bud :( What you could try is going over the bleach spot with a black permanent marker to match it with the original color

auUeI2Vnaa	Have you tried rinsing it in cold water?|`|5auHW7hHaa	perhaps try a different shampoo and conditioner.  also change your brush.|`|sGmMbLLoaa	i would suggest to not use conditionar, but if your hair gets tangly then buy a detangler,((:|`|U2U624i5aa	well i think u have normally greasy hair cus people have that which suks|`|VtZN0ov0aa	Use less conditioner and also if you wash your hair like every day or twice a day it actually makes your hair more greasy so maybe you need longer breaks between washing your hair. =D|`|bFT9EinFaa	You might want to try a different shampoo. I would suggest trying a cheap Clarifying shampoo for a week or so. That would strip out any product build up you might have in your hair, which can make your hair feel and look greasy. After that you can go back to using your regular conditioner and maybe use a clarifying or deep cleansing just once in a while. Also, make sure you are applying your conditioner just to the ends of your hair, and not to your scalp.|`|NOkxzBquaa	I find a lot of store bought shampoo and cond. do that. They clog the scalp .... I would suggest using a professional shampoo and cond. if your not already. Also maybe shampoo twice and only put the cond. on your ends.
iP9saNlBaa	Well, it depends on the person. Me and my friend went and had it done together... It REALLY hurt my friend when she had it done, so much that she was almost crying. But when I had it done it didn't hurt too much... It's far from pleasant though. The worst part was that I could feel the needle go through. My friends piercing hardly swelled at all, mine swole so big I had to back and have them put an even longer bar in. It hurts to eat for a few days, and brushing your teeth will probably get a little messy... But other than that it's all good :)|`|9cBLKOe8aa	Before you get a piercing you should learn to spell pierced. The fact that you don't take the time to make sure your words are spelled correctly shows that you may not take the time to properly care for a piercing.|`|Qxk1V55Zaa	lets see i had mine done when i was 14 i watched them do it in a mirror and i didn't feel it at all. i was surprised but.. the part that hurt the worst was trying to brush ur teeth the next day. other than taht if you take care of it really well.. it should only be swollen for a few days .. when you eat anything don't try a sandwich or anything like that.. the easiest things to eat are things that are in small pieces like.. fries. but watch the salt .. it kinda stings a wee bit... or... ramen is good lol so.. yea.. any more advice just.. ask anything and i check up on the piercing questions a lot so.. i should get back to ya . :) hope that helped
lU8e0VQFaa	Yes they can and they can fire you for ignoring the rules if they want. Although there's never been an actual case (that's I've heard of) of a earring or other jewelry falling into food at a restaurant it is still a possibility and therefor a worry of managers, the last thing they want is a customer choking on some waitress's barbell.|`|9cBLKOe8aa	They shouldn't have a problem with it if it's your lobes. Check with your manager before you switch your jewelery.|`|bFT9EinFaa	They can limit how many ear piercings as part of the dress code. At my job the dress code limits only two ear piercings and clear or see through nose piercings (I think, I only have one set of ear piercings so it didn't really apply to me).
AA11454948	Yeah, like the girl said above, yellow page for stylists....i normally go to local.yahoo.com, i think this is very good to 'narrow' down what type of salon you're looking for.    I am african american too, I used to rock a "rock 80's" style hair, on my own...very easy really.    When my hair was permed, i would just wash it and let it air dry (this is really good in the summer) and clip the sides of my hair up with hair combs, like an unruly mo-hawk.    Or for more of a "bob" look, put color streaks in ur hair and get it straighten and create a nice even / or asymetrical bang.|`|o2dnH9WAaa	try cliff @ uhh...hold on i will get right back to you on this. i cant remember what the name of the place is. I don't know if he'll be right for you, but he does my hair and my moms hair and does a good job (but its different styles, you and i have different hair types for sure)    well, i couldnt figure out what the place is called and its a long drive from towson anyway. have you checked yahoo yellow pages for hair salons in towson?
BtK9nSalaa	ur hair could b frizzy cuz ur drying it w a towel, use an old t shirt or if u have 2 go quickly blot w a towel and blow drying w-o a diffuser makes it frizzy also|`|f2711d8349aeed648c50f146c4496e35aa	Washing it,combing it with wide tooth comb, and putting in a leave in conditioner...|`|rdB2Pbldaa	I have thick, course, straight black hair, dyed so it has a reddish tinge.  So, I am currently using garnier fructis shampoo/conditioner. After I shampoo, I put in the conditioner and then I wash my face/do whatever else I need to do so the conditioner has time to work. Then I rinse with really cold water, which makes your hair shiny and smooth. When I get out, I put in Garnier Fructis leave-in conditioner while it's still damp and comb it out. I only wash my hair around every three to four days or when it gets oily because washing it every day can be harmful to your hair.    I have pretty managable hair, so I don't have to do anything else after that. Every morning I wake up, run a brush through my hair, and I'm set to go!

kT4VwAYTaa	i have thick curly hair & all i do is shower & blow dry then flat iron before i go to bed then i wake up flat iron again & spray a lil hair spray on it|`|gXBPLitzaa	Well when you get out of the shower use thermal creations heat tamer spray by tresemme you can find it in most drug stores or even grocery stores for a good price then blow dry your hair but not all the way, because blow drying it until its completely dry can fry your hair.  Then straighten it in sections put most of your hair up and do the buttom first & put a lil bit more down just do it in sections.  Hope this helps  If you have any other questions about this feel free to email me|`|135bBBW1aa	Why dont you get it chemically straightned it doesnt cost that much really also if you have bad straightners you should buy better ones like ghds my hair used to go dead frizzy but now i have ghds it stays straight. hope i helped you xxxx

These may be items you already have in your closet.  But, if not, you can find great seperates at very low prices at H&M or Top Shop.  If anything, put the money towards the skirt since this is the most versatile piece that you could dress up or down.|`|qL8f3rSsaa	What does 25 pounds transfer into American dollars???

I would say use a colour chart on clothes based on your shade of skin.  just like make up    those jeans are a very safe colour  so you would get away with pretty much anything with those.

akUibcJWaa	ewwwwwww don't do it yourself? do you realized how many nerves are on your tongue? i wouldn't even want my tongue pierced in the first place, but if you really want it back, go to a professional before you kill yourself. if you pierce a certain nerve, you might get serious injuries and life-threatening problems.|`|X7DDlR1caa	honest opinion?  That would be plain daft, go to a Professional!   x|`|2Urd6VLqaa	I wouldn't recommend it.  You can actually paralyze your tongue if you pierce it in the wrong spot.  Just to be safe, I would just go to a professional.    ?|`|bT9SXnYQaa	Yourself?!?   There is like a main artery or vein in your tongue, only a professional knows how to avoid it.|`|jgxDtWawaa	i rele wouldnt pierce it urself. It can cause so much damage. if u do it in the wrong place u cud hit a nerve and paralyse the whole of ur mouth and face. You should get it done professionaly xx|`|mJx42D2Iaa	I HIGHLY suggest you do NOT pierce your own tongue.   Here's what I found:   One danger of tongue piercing is the life long pain that can occur as a result of the piercing. The painful condition called neuralgia has been found to be associated with this particular type of piercing. Although the chances of it happening are rare, it's still a very real possibility. To avoid this from happening, only get your piercing done by a licensed professional.    Another danger of tongue piercing involves losing massive amounts of blood. The tongue contains several large blood vessels in it. One false move and you could lose quite a bit of blood. This is why tongue piercings should never be done at home or by someone without training and experience.    A serious infection is also a possible danger of tongue piercing. The mouth contains so much bacteria that it is not tough for an infection to occur. While your tongue is still healing, be careful to use proper hygiene and piercing care to keep you mouth healthy. This will reduce your chances of developing an infection.      Just dish out some cash and get it done by a pro and avoid this whole mess! A piercing done yourself can cause SOOO many problems. I would also tell you that tongue piercings are really bad for your mouth.. But I guess you wouldn't want to hear about that. Please, do your research and go to a professional. Good luck.|`|xwrOhf2Yaa	I wouldn't do that. Because it's in your mouth, it closes up much faster than anywhere else, so it won't be easy.  Just get it done properly!|`|fbSDIczQaa	You can pierce anything yourself.  I wouldn't do it to myself for the fear of making it lopsided.  You should get a friend to help you align it correctly.  There are many veins in your tongue, so be careful.|`|DGj8W7cZaa	NO DON'T!!  My friend did hers herself and it got infected, her tongue swelled up and she couldn't eat or talk properly for a week!  also because your tongue is obviously a lot thicker than say your earlobe, it will be hard to do it on yourself cos it will hurt and you will automatically hesitate and its hard to get it through  and as someone else said its got a major blood supply so could be dangerous  GET IT DONE PROFESSIONALLY!!!
a6f6d298cb34928f1e4c04a38c3beb6aaa	Make sure you don't put to much gel in your hair. Use a foam that has conditioner in it. Try going to a Black Beauty supply store they have tons of foam moose. Also once your hair starts to dry use Bio silk to stop the frizz. If that's to pricey try the generic version apply generously to the ends. Hope that helps!|`|B7mzzhZ5aa	dont use too much gel because it will dry it out. use a curling cream instead to get a sleeker look. also use a anti-frizz serum and put a leave in condititiner on your ends to give them moisture.        hope i helped :D

QCAJeDxzaa	I have seen and I do it also when I put on eyeliner with a pencil. The reason for this is when you open your mouth wide, it pulls the skin down under your eyes and makes it easier to apply eyeliner with a pencil on the bottom.  Try it. <br>  <br>  I don't see how opening your mouth will help with mascara or eyeliner on the eyelid; but surely when the skin under the eye is tighter, it lets you put on a thinner more accurate line of eyeliner.|`|IBZSL5f7aa	Aahaha i do it all the time , it automatically happens .<br>  its so my face gets all streached out hahaha <br>  and if i dont i get mascara EVERYWHERE <br>  <br>  i guess i COULD just lift my eyebrows and slightly close my eyes ,<br>  ha silly|`|t1QtLK4oaa	I know!!!!!<br>  I do it all the time with out noticing it. <br>  <br>  hahahaha|`|qroOTyrGaa	It's just a habit.|`|4NzQs1jWaa	I think it helps you blink less so it's easier to put it on :)|`|5kjYFb9Taa	Just like someone mentioned below.

AA10015648	When I last went skiing, I wore my hair in a ponytail and wrapped an ear-warmer around my head, like, the kind that are like big headbands. If you look good in a hat, wear a hat and let your hair just stick out under, maybe in pigtails or something. If you wear your hair down, it'll just get SO messy and stuck with moisture, that it's not worth it. <br>  <br>  If you don't wear goggles or ski-glasses, your eyes will be watering a LOT, so don't wear eye makeup unless you've got eyewear. If you are wearing goggles or ski-glasses, then go ahead and wear eyeliner and waterproof lash stuff. Nothing too fancy, you are skiing after all! Be sure to wear concealer and a foundation with SUNBLOCK! Your skin can get mad sunburn because of the reflection off the snow. Even if it's cloudy, you'll be outside longer than you're used to, and your skin needs protecting. Blush is pointless because you'll probably be nice and rosy-cheeked naturally. If you want to put on a little, just for the beginning, there's nothing wrong with it. Don't bother with lipstick - just get some really good chapstick with sunblock to protect those lips from wind/sunburn.<br>  <br>  Have fun! :D|`|WP3yRtt3aa	Obviously you are a novice skier...Most of your hair will be covered by a helmet or hat...don't bother doing anything fancy, it will get ruined.  I advise you to apply no makeup, that too will just get ruined.|`|qpWStE5Saa	well for hair, nobody cares how you look when your doing physical stuff! Idk bout make up though....|`|WxoZrTPlaa	Skiing is pretty active, so I'd say a ponytail.  You will be wearing a hat, though, so maybe just straight down, with the hat, will be fine.  Little to no makeup.  You'll be active, in the snow, don't need the makeup.  Sunscreen is important and some kind of lip balm. <br>  <br>  Have fun!

0xz8mR2xaa	Oh, I've definitely seen Black people sporting red highlights, and I think it's a great look. Black scene kids seem to gravitate towards this color, perhaps because it just looks so great. I'd suggest a slightly brighter red, though I suppose it depends upon your skin tone and tastes.|`|1joY9n18aa	it looks hot  my friend stacy got them she looks awesome|`|zzkmdusEaa	I've seen it a lot.

233590b251f45be4c87301ea1aee7103aa	You can not do this yourself.  Any red color you put on that bleached out platinum hair will turn a shade of pink.  You need to go to a salon that specializes in color.  The blond hair needs to have a filler put on it first (a darker color that will stain the hair as well and get rid of the blond) only then can you put on color over that.  I would recommend NOT doing it at all.|`|p3GZERIsaa	Yeh :]|`|uzMLuL9Daa	yeah that lady looks like a man! lol jk :D <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  it is gonna look great btw|`|ik2qt7ccaa	I like it :)
R5UIMBvcaa	Try Covermark.  It's a patented concealer that was developed back in the 1930s or 40s to cover birthmarks.  Although I've never used it for that purpose, I ordered some a few years ago when I fell on my face on a slippery sidewalk and had a purple chin.  The stuff worked beautifully!      A few weeks later, when my husband fell on the steps and came in looking as if he had been in a fight, I tried some on him, with equal success.  The scrapes and bruises didn't show, and he didn't look like a man wearing make-up, either--just looked as if nothing had happened.      Here's a link: http://www.covermarkusa.com/  Incidentally, I was able to order a collection of several similar shades, so that one of them was bound to be the right match.  Good luck!|`|LYdxypciaa	There is a new its a concealer called sudio finish spf 35 that MAC Makeup has releasing.

O1PQlN14aa	Well I have a passion for makeup. It's an art and is a task that must be practiced as all other arts. First, with your powders, you should reconsider the brush you're using. There are many different grades of powder from medium to fine which can feel like a blanket of silk when applied properly. A proper brush for application is needed to do so. Also, pay attention to how much product you're using. Too much can cause the powder to appear cakey and blotchy which isn't the desirable look for you, yes? Dryness of the skin, oiliness, and uneven texture play a role in how your powders AND foundations set, although many people fail to acknowledge this. <br>  <br>  *A quick fix for dryness is a nice and sweet daytime facial moisturizer specifically for dry skin :)<br>  *For oiliness try these three easy steps: <br>      1.Wash entire face, avoiding eyes, with an everyday cleanser as you would on a regular basis. For deep cleansing of pores if you're acne prone, I recommend St. Ives Apricot scrubs. Gentle, effective, and they smell great :)<br>      2.Thoroughly smooth an oil free moisturizer onto skin until fully absorbed. (Another, more pampering, method is to practice your piano skills while applying the moisturizer. Short, gentle pulses around the entire face helps the product to sink into your pores and also tones the skin. Try it!^-^) <br>      3. After the moisturizer has been completely absorbed (approximately 5 minutes) splash face with ice cold water. This will reduce inflammation in the skin, slightly tightens, brightens, and minimize pores. Gently pat dry.. Apply powder<br>  <br>  For uneven texture such as large pores, acne bumps, inflammation, small hairs, and any other raised areas of the skin, use a primer. A primer for your skin type is best. <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  The trickiest part of applying eye makeup is blending. Practice on the back of your hand :) It helps a bunches, trust me. The next obstacle is achieving two even eyes! But hey, nothing is perfect. They can be a little off so long as it's not too noticeable. Follow the natural contour of your eye. Your lid stops at the fold of the eye. This is where your crease begins. Depending on how fare you want the crease colour to blend upwards, the brow colour usually starts at your orbital bone. Feel for it with your ring finger which has the gentlest touch of all your pokers^_^<br>  <br>  I really didn't mean for this answer to be so extensive but I wanted to thoroughly explain each part so that you'll better understand. I am studying to be a makeup artist and at such a young age, 16, I'm honoured to say I've taught myself everything I know. It was fun yet difficult and I feel everyone should have a mentor . Two minds are better than one :) So far I've taught my mom, my best friend, and I hope that I've helped you a bit. <br>  Practice! Practice! Practice!<br>  <br>  Email me if you want to know more, take care sweetie.|`|PWS0x8Gwaa	It could be a number of things. Powder is really easy to put on incorrectly. If it's flaky, your skin might be too dry, and a moisturizer beforehand would help. If it's streaky, blend it with a brush. If it's kind of cakey or concentrated in certain areas, consider switching your tools. I've heard powder puffs work really well for it, and brushes are good for blending and even coverage. Finally, your shade may not be the right one for your face. If that's it, it's just a matter of trial and error to find the right one.|`|H2txnM65aa	How much are you using? if its alot. try cutting down on how much face powder you use, or use mosturiser it breaks it down. try going for a natural look on your eyes, using maby brown eye liners instead of a black. hope it helps.|`|DXLfbKUBaa	you need a good moisturiser and if you have oily skin use a primer under your foundation, it really does help your make up stay in place.

Swirl it around over these areas|`|t1QtLK4oaa	when using powders on your face you need to always <br>  1) exfoliate- because it removed the dead skin where the powder make will just cling to and make it look cacky. <br>  <br>  2) moisturizer- b/c dry skin and powder do not go together.<br>  <br>  3) primers- primers are great because they fill in fine lines and wrinkles and make makeup last all day|`|ATmWctQvaa	try going to the mall for a makeup consultation at one of the counters in a department store or at mac cosmetics and have them help you out!|`|WU7xMQCyaa	Moisturiser does help and heat eyeliner up before you use it|`|fZgoUty4aa	need pics

I feel happy about the way I look but sometimes I feel like you do. I use eyeliner just on the bottom.|`|Vm2ywW5Caa	Definitely eyeliner on the top and bottom. I know a lot of people with small eyes who avoid eyeliner because it makes them smaller. I have very big eyes, and I've noticed my best angle in pictures is definitely at an angle. Not looking fully straight, but not fully to the side. It's really hard to explain by typing.. but kinda like your forhead will be facing to the left of the camera a bit, but your eyes looking directly into the camera. Also, try having the camera above you where you have to look up at it a bit.

That is an urban legend.<br>  <br>  The cartilage will not shatter if you go to a proper piercer and get it done with a needle.  That only happens when a piercing gun is used since guns pierce with blunt force.  A piercing needle is sharp and cuts through tissue and cartilage very cleanly, no worries.<br>  <br>  As long as you take good care of it and go to a good piercer you will be fine.|`|IIkoO1cRaa	i have mine and love it;<br>  pro: its cute obviously<br>  <br>  con: its hard to put headphones in and such for awhile<br>  and they dont really fit.|`|xU3uBy4Saa	No, it can't paralyze your face.<br>  <br>  Well I can't think of any other pros besides that it is super cute!  I think that is one of the only reasons why people get them done.<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  Healing process is worse than the actual piercing (to me).  It can take up to 2-3 weeks for soreness to go away.<br>  If you listen to music with headphones, those earbuds are hard to get into your ear (like the iPod earbuds).<br>  When you accidently touch it a little too hard, it hurts like hell.<br>  <br>  <br>  I have both my left and right tragus' pierced.  I just thought it looked cuter with both.  My left ear hurt more than my right when it was pierced and during the healing process.  Not that it is healed, everything looks fine and I LOVE it!|`|GR30bvH9aa	i have a tragus piercing and i's wicked cute i love it.  no it can't paralyze your ace, the only thing that i have heard is about the freezing spray that some piercers put on to numb it, can you cause you to lose hearing.  I don't know if that is true, but you don't even need the numbing spray.  And also as long as you don't get your tragus done with a gun, your cartilage will not shatter, you should never get anything done with a gun besides your lobes.  but if you really want it you should go get it.  it's a wicked cute piercing and healing time really isn't that bad, the only thing that sucks is the headphone thing at the gym.|`|CFnkrvyvaa	I had it done and loved it. You just have to be really careful when answering phones and stuff because it is sore for a long time afterwards. I didn't think it was that painful. I thought getting my cartilage at the top of my ear hurt worse. I eventually had to take it out though because it got infected.

kCdISEGqaa	Nope, I had my apprenticeship in Iowa, and the law allows NO minors tattooed, even with parental consent.  The artist and your parents could get in major trouble.  The artist could lose their license at a minimum, and your parents would be charged with child neglect.<br>  <br>  Florida, New Mexico, North Dakota, Colorado, and Idaho allow it if you are 16 with parental consent, but, only nasty, unclean artists will do it.  No reputable shop will tattoo a minor.|`|ALxvsSWiaa	By the time you get into your 50's you'll look like an old scrubber. Forget the tattoos - they're not for girls, just sailors and dockers.|`|v5J50Ep2aa	if you have a parent with you you can, but it also depends on the shop!|`|rLJhtz9qaa	mexico|`|FDgHnvm3aa	if you have parent permission, most shops.<br>  <br>  but other than that......no. its not something that any reputable artist will do.|`|A3Cq707Laa	Only if you join the navy|`|rFMRgHTdaa	most shops you have to have your parents permission, but you can always find ppl that will tattoo from home.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	In Iowa, no.  It's a serious misdemeanor according to the law.<br>  <br>  There are a handful of states that allow it with parental permission, but even in those states, a lot of good shops won't do it no matter what.
1ec68af802a245413f439236df86307daa	those are european sizes. i wear a 0 usually, but in european that's about a 25 or 26. you kind of just have to try them on and figure out what size fits you best though.|`|Y4pfVX10aa	those are eropean
lU8e0VQFaa	It's a godsend, I started breaking out at 8 and never had a clear day since. I started on Christmas Eve and my face is completely clear except for one or two spots. My body is taking a little longer but it too is starting to clear up. My Dr started me on 40 and then the second month upped it to 60 and now for the third I'm on 80 and will stay at this for the rest of the treatment (and I hope you have GOOD insurance, my last Rx was $2000). As for side effects, get some Carmex lip balm, you'll need it, my lips started to dry out on the second day, before I found the carmex, even using Aquphor and medicated blistex 10 times a day they were so bad they started cracking and bleeding. Carmex stopped that. Also, if you have ANY soaps or face products that have any sort of acne medication, toss them as soon as you start, your skin won't be able to handle that and the accutane. <br>  <br>  To be honest, once I swtiched to a organic herbal soap I haven't really had dry skin problems (on my face at least). For the first month and a half my body skin dried out really bad and I would get small rashes if I scratched too much, but that's stopped. Now there's just a little dryness near my elbows. At first I started getting a little bit of depression but after a few minutes I remebered it was just the pills and while I still felt depressed it didn't bother me because I knew it wasn't me. But that only lasted a couple of weeks. The other wierd thing is I have had a little joint pain, but only in one finger and only at one knuckle and it's not even on my right hand (I'm a righty so I use it the most). It's been pretty constant for the last month and it hurts but not bad enough to really bother me. My Dr couldn't figure out why it was just that one but she said as long as I could deal with it it was fine. And my appititate has increased a little.<br>  <br>  DO NOT take ANY multivitimian, most of them contain vitimin A which since Accutane is a vitimin A deritive can cause liver failuer and other really bad problems. When in doubt ask your Dr. No waxing either (this part sucks the most for me). No drinking (my Dr only apporoved me for 1 beer a WEEK and that's just because my liver function hasn't changed at all, you may not be as lucky). <br>  <br>  It's a pain in the *** to get approved for, what with all the hoops and **** the government makes you jump though (you can buy a handgun easier than accutane). <br>  <br>  But yeah, that's about it, make sure you ask your Dr about anything and everything, it's such a powerful drug and can interact with so many different things, it's better safe than sorry. Hopefully you'll be like me and have few side effects and the treament will be easy.<br>  <br>  Yes it will cause horrible birth defects....if you're stupid enough to get knocked up while taking it (no offense meant but anyone who takes a drug like this and knows what it can do to a baby and ignores safety precautuions and gets preggers is an idoit). Just be careful, take your birth control CORRECTLY and you'll be fine.|`|LYdxypciaa	hmmm<br>  you havent said whta your medication is called.<br>  is it retena a? <br>  if so it's really good at clearing up spots. <br>  but some side effects are your face beng very rash-like red.<br>  <br>  this is all i know about it, hope i helped x|`|JwnHKTabaa	Oh gosh, my boyfriend had to use it (he has severe cystic acne)<br>  He was super moody, and even had a reaction to it a couple months after starting it.<br>  (He was in the sun for a couple days and it caused a HORRIBLE rash that spread all over his body, and the rash started peeling a couple weeks later...)|`|KqxQlPrNaa	DON'T DO IT GIRL!!!!!    It is linked to MAJOR birth defects!  There is a product that you can get at most dermatologists and plastic surgeons offices called Clensiderm which is made by Obagi.  It is prescription strength and works miracles.  Please don't take the accutane!|`|lYIijzpQaa	One of my friends used Accutane. For the first little while, his skin was SO dry, it was driving him crazy. Flaking, itchy skin all over his body, especially his face. His acne did disappear, but I don't know if it was worth dealing with the extremely dry skin.

KqxQlPrNaa	I am so sorry to tell you this but NOTHING works on strech marks.  I work for a Plastic Surgeon and we have people come in every day and ask that very question!  Strechmarks are actual broken fibers in the skin and there is no cream that can repair torn fibers.  The only thing that can be done is a tummy tuck for streckmarks BELOW the naval but you have to also have excess skin and fat in order to surgically remove them.  Sorry.|`|9byPkIXZaa	use a body butter lotion you can get it at wal mart or the mall rub it on 4 to 5 times a day|`|h8ILU2vdaa	Bio Oil is supposed to be really good. :)|`|fsrLp3HMaa	palmers cocoa butter.

RoFfCYGxaa	There is nothing wrong with big foreheads, it just means our brains are too big to fit!!  I like the first picture the best, I think if you do decide to go dark you should definitely go for a darker brown not a lighter brown, but you look really nice with the blonde hair too.  I say go dark.|`|2Ltc1dAwaa	As a stylist, I really would advise you to do a more of a mahogany or a light brown.  <br>  I think dark brown is too much of a contrast from your facial colour and makes your skin tone look more pale than it actually is.  <br>  The blond blends in too much with your face and your features, such as your beautiful eyes and complexion are masked by the overbearing lightness.  <br>  <br>  I think a light brown, or brown-red colour would look absolutely stunning on you, highlight your gorgeous eyes and make your skin colour more vibrant!|`|N6GZAOeQaa	Brunette!!!!!!!!! <br>  DEFINITLEY|`|AA10910000	Brunette, but then I like brunettes and it suits you.

xT024KMsaa	Sounds like all you need is a decent primer. I use Too Faced Shadow Insurance, but also hear good things about Urban Decay Primer Potion. Mine cost $17 but I've had it for a month and have not even used half of it (I use it every day!). Definitely worth it.|`|ClBkTdOEaa	there really is no way to keep it on. Maybe half way through the day you can go to the bathroom and reapply it. Eyeliner can easily fit in your pocket and mascara if you want. I hairspray my face LIGHTLY to keep on my make up, but don't try that for eyeliner...that could cause serious damage to your eyes. But it really works for eyelids and cover up. good luck hun. ;)|`|tGEMwgyBaa	I have been doing make-up professionally for a long time and this is what I would do for you...Apply a base to your eyelids and under your eyes. Depending on you skin tone you can use violet for dark circles and yellow for red puffy under eyes. A base is different than a concealer. Look for anything that says base. Then after applying your base use your concealer then foundation. It's an extra step but believe me, you won't need to reapply and it will last all day long and no creasing of your eyeshadow either. Hope this helps out.<br>  Wendi|`|MI7Vo2d5aa	Get an eyeliner brush.  After applying your stick liner, go over the line with some black eyeshadow powder using the brush.|`|AA11655290	use two mascaras. 1st put on avon waterproof and then put on maybelline waterproof. make sure they are both the same color of course!|`|Xf6RaBRZaa	try primer...it works to keep eyshadows and that stuff on you can by it anywere that really sells beauty stuff|`|ZJqcRUNiaa	OMG me too same prob. but I found this Maybelle brush for your eye shadow With some wet and wild eyeshadow, then try the new stiletto mascara and eyeliner from Sphora. Sephora is kind of expensive but totally worth it.
Ecx8SQM3aa	YES  bleach it for sure. You get it bleached and it last for ever. If you wax it off it grows back thicker and darker. I KNOW Been there done that. I get mine bleached. Laser is expensive but will be worth it. I don't know what Beauty parlor you go to but it will grow back. They were wrong for giving you bad advice. Listen to me.|`|OSD5by7Oaa	oh well you should get her appointed to wax it off every now and then.|`|R75tldc8aa	Bleach is safe as long as you supervise the use of it, and just be careful.<br>  However I think waxing is best because the hair is actually removed and takes a while to grow back. Home waxing kits do not always work that good so I recommend you get it done at a salon.|`|yXGlmUqlaa	bleaching it is safe. i started doing it when i was younger than 13. <br>  when i was about 14 i started waxing. keep waxing.<br>  <br>  <br>  i can understand why she wouldn't want to do this but is it an option to wax the rest? if not, then face bleach is fine|`|a8c1ec2782f2cbb1944ac1b3fd537fa6aa	It's called Joleen...do a patch test|`|668551ae8f7b043f957455c854361b2daa	NO !U WANT HER 2 DIE ?!|`|l5mFq1dqaa	No I think it just damages it more

zZ9UbXJwaa	I used to have acrylic nails which were French manicured with a white tip. They used to get quite long so I'd have the tips filed to a square shape. I had the acrylics for about 4 years until one day I ripped one off and the state of my nail underneath was awful!<br>  <br>  I had them removed and my own nails are just recovering. Personally, I think short nails (just peeping over the top of the fingertip) which are filed square and painted a dark colour look neater and classier than talons. Just my personal preference though :)|`|ACwyDaj3aa	eat lots of garlic and your nail will grow long|`|uz6z6kxUaa	I'm 17, a tomboy.<br>  <br>   Ever since this summer I loved biting them, I'm not gonna lie. But something told me to stop, and I did. They look a lot prettier now and everyone compliments on them. Thing is, I can't keep them too long, since I used to bite them, they chip very easily.|`|hw8jOWaeaa	I let mine get about 1/2 inch past the end of my fingers before I trim them.

As long as they mean something to you, you won't regret them.  So think long and hard about what you want on your body cuz its going to be there for life.  What I do is look online for ideas and if I have the same idea in 6 months I get it but if I have a different idea then I keep looking til I know thats the one I want.|`|0BjfEel2aa	If you don't want a regretful tattoo don't use your boyfriends name or initials until you are truly, truly happy and really think you are going to be 2 gether 4 ever. Because wouldn't you hate if you broke up with them then had your ex's name on you. That probably wouldn't make your new bf happy if he thought you might be cheating on him.|`|kGpgpgKeaa	Don't get a partners name or anything like that done. I had a matching tattoo done with my ex and it was the stupidest thing I have ever done. Thankfully it is small and can be easily covered.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	im not really sure how you could 'regret' a piercing since you can always just take it out when you dont want it anymore but tattoo wise, i have 10 and dont regret any of them.|`|rLJhtz9qaa	eventually youll regret them when your old and your tatoo looks like a disfigured mole...|`|LYxCuCWhaa	It's hard to console you on that point because every person is different. When I got my first large tattoo (about 12 inches tall by 10 inches wide on my shoulder and ribs) I won't lie, I panicked a little when I saw the size. But that lasted about 3 seconds and then I took a deep breath and loved it. I've never looked back.<br>  <br>  I'm 19 and I already have 3 tattoos, but so far no regrets. I refuse to tattoo something on my body that doesn't have some intense meaning to me, so I shouldn't have that problem. As long as you put thought into your ink and it means something to you, you won't regret it.|`|cPuHQSVLaa	i have 3 tattoos total, and while i like them, i should have thought them through better, 2 of them i got on impulse. i like tattoos though. personally, i would regret anything that wouldn't be covered when i have my clothes on, just because it can limit your potential for jobs.|`|AA11417977	If it's something meaningful that represents your life, you should never have to regret it. Just make sure you're not getting something that simply illustrates a temporary fad or current boyfriend's name.|`|UZldkMgRaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOPE !|`|FDgHnvm3aa	if ti is somehting that is meaningful, you wont regret it

It's expensive..but it's worth it!|`|233590b251f45be4c87301ea1aee7103aa	The only way to fix it is to cut the damaged hair off.  There are products that will make it feel better, but it won't fix the damage it will only cover it up a little and maybe make it look a little better.  Once hair is damaged, it can't be fixed, only cut off.|`|h8ILU2vdaa	Get a really good hair cut that will get rid of the split ends.<br>  Try Moroccan Oil.

First I would go to my salon and get a deep conditioning treatment. While you are there and if they sell Redken products, start using the Redken All Soft. It worked wonders for my hair, I started noticing a difference in the 1st week. Good Luck!!!|`|LROAETQCaa	vv

69GgJhnWaa	Actually, that is not an industrial. Industrials run from the base of the curve near the top of your ear to the middle of the part of your ear where it curves over more. That is just a cartilage piercing with another piercing inside the upper portion of your ear. Just take in the pic to a piercer and they can do it.|`|zlXofrG4aa	Looks just like a couple of normal piercings to me placed right next to eachother.  Definitely NOT an industrial.

HZvo9YFHaa	should be okay|`|mhyL7Qw3aa	That is good but you should put on an eyeliner and a clear or light pink lip gloss.|`|JRpD7Yu5aa	That`s less makeup then most of the girls wore when I went to high school. `Props to not needing a pound of makeup! Less make up = more sleep in time = less haggard look.|`|hntZWnLuaa	it sounds ok, just as long as it looks completely natural :)|`|fltNZu6eaa	i love Benefit, and it's probably a googd amount, as long as it doens't look too much on you.|`|B5AKcZ5Laa	you dont want to wear so much make up you look fake and ppl cant stand to be around  and u dont want to come off as a snob try not to wear so much and keep it natural looking guys like tht alot better than a girl who looks completly different without there makeup|`|TX1GZvJ8aa	in highschool iits not all about makeup and everything like that.

I dont think you need the under the eye cirles though, your only what 13, or 14? Loose that, keep everything else. You could even go with a dark brown mascara or black.|`|D4gixVFyaa	no blush if you use concealer and have a small red tint then there's your rose, but blush is kind of pushing it. try and make it look like your not wearing make-up, guys like "natural" girls....well at least their make-up.|`|FdXFuL2naa	That is a bit over the top! mabye just a little blush, a little mascara and the right amount of eye shaddow....Hope I helped :)|`|yaNKFAGFaa	in high school so many people wear different things, and most just go with the flow. concealer is fine, moisturizer is great too, redness is good too, and the mascara. I think blush might be a bit too much...  Good luck in high school!~ it's not too bad. :D|`|n0A3eMWCaa	Okay, Im the exact same age as you.   And, I also LOVE benefit.. BUT i have learned that different brands work better for different things.  For Tinited Moisturizer, I have a great MAC product. it has SPF 15, and a nice tint. It also sets great.   I have recently switched to mineral makeup, because it gives for coverage, but looks totally natural. Mineral makeup has SPF too!  Try BareMinerals. Its available at sephora for around 30$. It covers all flaws and looks so natural! I also use either, High beam, or BareMinerals blush in a really natural light color. For mascara try smashbox, mac, or Benefit. Try the benefit ones that brighten your eye color.. I think its like plum for brown eyes or blue for blue eyes? That way its not like, black, or colored.. it just brightens your eye color and extends lashes.  For more tips and makeup reviews: http://ca.youtube.com/user/secretr0cksta...  GOOD LUCK!|`|C8bhul21aa	if it's okay with your parents, i would say add a little eyeliner. you could start off with light brown, just to bring out your eyes a little more. also, think about getting an eyelash curler and maybe even using black mascara. you'll be amazed how great you look. as for everything else, i think it will look great.     :)|`|z08jBhoqaa	ON the clear mascara, you should use Mabeline New York. I use it and LOVE it. But mix it up a bit by using some brown/black mascara too.|`|S7bgGIDvaa	honestly, I wear makeup everyday!! but I wear it natural looking, looks great without looking to much like a fake. Don't over do it.|`|4fUOfscbaa	yeah, but i think that you should find a concealer that both hides dark circles & redness. and use a light foundation and a little eyeliner.|`|as9RDbJaaa	Sounds Great!  Not too subtle,  but not too much!|`|KVlwGhVjaa	okaii,     I'm at high school in England (Suffolk) and we go to high school at 13/14 and I'm at high school, if you want to look like a complete slut then yeah that should be fine. But if I was you, I would just go for  foundation (dream matte mousse?), black mascara (rimmel london?,) maybe eye shadow and lip gloss. That would be perfect. Never use to much though, because then you would look desperate and like one of those little girls who have just come out of middle school and want to look all cool for high school.... trust me, that doesn't work.    Good luckkkk    xxxx|`|H1O8xzLQaa	I don't think blush is needed. I'm in high school and people go a little over the top. I go to a performing arts school and lets just say there are some... interesting people there. Im guessing in a regular high school people just got with concealer eye liner and mascara . At least thats what I do. I know you don't want to hear this but just be yourself!|`|iUhIEz03aa	It sounds okay its not a lot of makeup.
KGppArcfaa	Its perfectly fine for you to wet it. It probably just looks like this because you were sleeping and it got messy. Wet it, and maybe put a little serum or something on it and it will spring right back up|`|h8ILU2vdaa	You can wet it 24 after getting the perm + if the curls aren't as spirally as when you got it done, you can go back to the salon + they should fix it. :)|`|U9QSOLUtaa	Well your hair wont look exactly as pretty as when you left the salon today because you slept on it. Maybe today you can touch up those spots with a curling iron, however, DON'T WASH IT YET. If you wash your newly permed hair, the perm will wash out. You have to give it a few days to soak in. You hair IS still permed, and will go back to what you had at the salon in a few days when you can wash it again.

y1jRV0I4aa	Put your hand in a dish of warm water and use LOTS of soap to lube it up, should slip right off. ( don't do it in the sink of course, it might get lost!)    You could also use lotion or as a last resort something like butter.    good luck!|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	use some ice to relieve some of the swelling also|`|fhyYh3Dzaa	Cover your finger in butter, lotion or oil (like olive oil). That will loosen it up. You can run it under some hot (not so hot as to burn you) water to cause the ring to expand.

ZdF1hx70aa	It sounds like we have identical skin. I have tried everything and I mean everything. The best thing I figured out is to wash your face with normal face wash and moisturize your checks and use toner on your oily areas. If this doesn't work then try to pick up a rosacea face wash. That helps with the redness.<br>  <br>  See the problem with using meds and harsh treatments like proactive is your face gets used to it and it ends up not working anymore or worse you break out even more. <br>  <br>  Just do the simple stuff and see if that makes a difference. Sometimes for people like us with sensitive fair skin it is too much for our skin to handel and it does the opposite. <br>  <br>  Good luck! I hope I could help:)|`|lU8e0VQFaa	If it's been a year and you're still breaking out then I think it's time you switched prescriptions since what you have isn't working. In the mean time, I suggest going more natural with your face products. I found the the more chemicals and by products I cut out the better my skin started to behave. Burt's bees is pretty good, or with a little bit of study you can make your own all natural products. I did that for a while but it became very time consuming. A cheap and quick way I've been reading about is aspirin masks, I have yet to try it myself but have read really god reviews about it (take a few UN-coated aspirin, crush them up and mix with a little water or for better results raw honey). I also have an organic herbal papaya soap that I have fallen in love with, after just 2 days my skin looked so good a couple of coworkers went out and bought some for themselves. It's called Likas, you can get it pretty cheap on ebay, just make sure the box has holograms on it, otherwise it's a counterfeit.|`|OSD5by7Oaa	ummmm take the proactive green tea moisturizer|`|of049X1waa	Well, it really helps to drink lots of water... like 12 glasses a day!  Also try to avoid caffeine, or greasy food like fries or chocolate.  Stress is a known cause of acne, so try to relax!!  <br>  <br>  Get a good set of skin care stuff... like prescription face wash and acne spot treatment.  If your stuff doesn't work, see a dermatologist and get new stuff!  You should also be using non-comodogenic moisteurizer on your face, and when you wear sunscreen it should also be non-comodegenic.  Get a good toner, those help a bit.<br>  <br>  Be sure to keep your face very clean.  Wash it in the morning and at night (and after you work out) but other than that, DO NOT TOUCH IT!!  No putting your hands to your face!  Make sure make-up brushes/sponges are clean, the towel you dry your face with is clean, your pillowcase is clean, etc.  Always wash your hands before you wash your face or put on make-up!  Also, hair cream can be bad for your face so sleep with your hair tied up if you have gel/conditioner in it.  But above all remember that being very healthy is good for your skin and for the rest of you, so eat right, exercise, get plenty of sleep, and drink lots of water!|`|uzMLuL9Daa	:(
KqxQlPrNaa	Most people opt to do facelifts in the winter.  It is cool so you can wear hats and scarfs to cover the incisions.

But don’t worry about all this. These are all natural occurrences in the lip piercing healing process.<br>  <br>  Here are some basic tips about aftercare of lip piercing:<br>  <br>  ?Avoid eating, smoking and drinking within the first three hours of the piercing. <br>  ?Avoid alcohol, tobacco, and drugs before and after getting pierced, and till the wound is completely healed. <br>  ?Wash your hands frequently, and any time if you are going to touch the piercing. This will significantly reduce your chances of getting an infection. <br>  ?Do saline soak twice a day. <br>  ?Use a new soft-bristled toothbrush and keep it clean. <br>  ?You should brush twice a day to remove food particles that could get into the wound and cause an infection. <br>  ?Always keep your mouth sanitized. This should be done after eating, smoking and drinking. <br>  ?Avoid oral sexual till the wound is completely healed. <br>  ?Do rinse your mouth with a mouthwash after meals or eating. For the first 2 weeks you should suck on antibacterial/anti-inflammatory throat lozenges (Difflam-C), these reduce the chance of infection and reduce swelling. <br>  ?Ibuprofen will help keep the swelling and tenderness to a minimum, and can be taken when needed for pain. <br>  ?Avoid sharing plates, cups, and eating utensils. <br>  ?Vitamin B with Zinc helps in quick healing process. It is better, if you start taking this vitamin a few months before you get the piercing done. <br>  ?Do eat things such as frozen yogurt, ice cream, cold foods, or suck on chipped or crushed ice, or very small ice blocks for the first 2 weeks. Cold things help the healing, alleviate pain and reduce swelling. <br>  ?Dry with disposable paper products such as gauze or tissues, because cloth towels can harbor bacteria and catch on new piercing causing injury. <br>  ?Avoid submerging in bodies of water such as lakes, pools, etc. <br>  ?Don’t remove or replace the jewellery during the healing period, as the hole closes up very quickly and it’s painful to reinsert the jewellery once this happens. <br>  ?If it becomes necessary for you to remove the piercing, then the best thing to do is to go to your piercer to have it taken out.|`|585ab0776084269babf0060c20972036aa	Gum and teeth damage is always a possibility with any oral piercing.  Your gums probably won't be affected with higher placement, but chipped and worn teeth will still be a concern.  You can minimize your risk by wearing properly fitting jewelry at all times.  You will need a longer barbell for the first few weeks to accommodate swelling, but you should go back to your piercer after about 2 weeks to have him/her put in a shorter barbell.  Plastics like PTFE or bioflex can help minimize this damage (not to mention they are super comfortable), but you still need to be careful to wear properly sized jewelry.|`|kUgxskmSaa	it will look really cool !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...

1Qz0cZ2Waa	I would call the corporate office. You are paying for a full tan... You should definitely complain!!!
C1dRwOWAaa	It's just brow shadow and lots of eyeliner! I would reccomend mac fluidline in blacktrack with a hard angle brush for that dense clear black line :)|`|DkVofG9paa	use liquid.. if your question is only about the eyeliner... i use revlon liquid and pencil.  double effect.|`|WoeRTuzCaa	I like to use black eyeshadow by Loreal with an angled eyeliner brush. I get the brush wet and then rub it in the eyeshadow creating almost a liquid eyeliner. Line my eyes, top and bottom, and then for any mistakes use a wet q-tip to smooth out the edges. When it dries, it dries more like a powder, so it's a bit softer and doesn't smudge very easy.|`|w4SJu6PXaa	I suggest using a liquid liner. You can get a really precise line. I don't personally use liquid, but I know that the MAC liquid liner lasts PERFECTLY all day. Also, for your water line (inner ridge of lower lashes) you can use the MAC Smolder Kohl eyeliner because it stays on great, is fairly dark, and is safe for your water line. ( I had this, but mine got stolen a week after I bought it!). <br>  <br>  Otherwise, you could go to a makeup counter (I suggest MAC because I am a huge fan of their eyeliners, but if you have a different brand you prefer, go to that counter) and tell them about the look you are going for.Hope I helped!|`|L7wo7mPQaa	i think so but use the liquid or something like that and you don't want it to dark especially if you don't like eye shadow, like me
tuULGJS6aa	I prefer briefs on my men. I find men of various heights attractive. That depends on the man. I'm 5'7", 120 lbs., and I don't make a habit of dating men smaller than I am. A friend of a friend has a boyfriend 7'1", 352 lbs., and he is well-built and sexy to her and to me as well.|`|tQgSKOtwaa	Boxer briefs. Try here http://www.discountshollywood.com  http://www.raininghollywood.com  shipping is FREE !!!!|`|6BWINZAdaa	Boxer briefs. Wow you are tall!!! I'm 5'0 so I wouldn't prefer you. Maybe a woman who was 5'10 would prefer you.|`|RyOWcmlvaa	definitely boxer briefs!!! so sexy that your tall ;)|`|wo8B7hnOaa	actually I really don't care what men wear whatever makes them feel comfy. lol. and if it were me they wouldn't be lasting long  I would definitly find you sexy.  I always date tall guys.
QPg2UqUQaa	Yeah go for it, Clip in extentions are great, I've always used them, I've currently got 20" ones, that are bonded on to my hair, when i have these taken out, i wear the clip in ones for a month or so, till m have these bonded in again - go for it!|`|bT9SXnYQaa	It's a great deal. Get it
ZhttnYsEaa	omg this happened to me but i am in the middle of dark and light blonde and i wanted to go lighter then i bought a bleach blonde die and i had it in and my mum told me to take it out (because my hair was going white)when i only had it in for like 5 mins it went strawberry blonde so i went the the hair dressers and they cut and layered my hair and died it my normal colour and put light light blonde bits in it it is growing out but you can not see it is so go to a hair dresser by the way my hair is naturale blonde if i did not make it clear x:)|`|xasvOGnZaa	OMG!!!   I am not a person that tells people to spend millions at the hairdressers, but it seems like you' ve got a serious problem!!!  I think you should visit one or at least go there and ask what should you do. I think that should be for free :)  But besides I think the dark brown will do it, only, do you want it to be dark brown again? I mean you waited 6 month for it to grow out!

27bou3SBaa	Hey!  Monochrome is very in this season, so you could wear you white pumps, with some black/dark jeans, and if you have a pretty lace top (lace is also in) or just have a white shirt, you could wear that over a plain black top.  Then if you have any black/white accessories wear them, and for make up use foundation ect...with black eyeliner & bit of white eyeshadow if you have it, but it dosn't matter if you don't.  Wear your hair down, and if you have a black headband that would be perfect!!    hope you like it!!  x|`|F2LI7zjraa	long fitted top   cropped cardi  dark bootleg trousers  hair down in side parting with alice band  pumps  simple, natural makeup
gfksposqaa	**** your cousin, guys give the best haircuts.    I guess it depends on how long your hair is, if it's long, go to a salon and have a woman do it.  If it's short, men are better at it.
sg0m6LBRaa	noo.  i dont agree...    well some are.  but there are some tall guys that are attractive too..|`|eDP3YU5Laa	yeah sometimes|`|GWRP3vLQaa	The most attractive guys are those whose weight is in proportion to their height, so it really is a proportion issue. In the teens sometimes a guy will shoot up in height, and their weight remains the same, so they look lanky and awkward. Give them time and they eventually fill out (usually).     I have the advantage of having lived a long time and some of the guys I know who weren't much to look at in high school turned out to be extremely handsome later on.     But then again, a few really good looking guys in H.S. turned out to be  pretty ugly as they aged. Ya just never know... LOL.     Point is, look for the beauty inside the person, because that is what you will get stuck with in the end.    P.S. They guy I ended up marrying wasn't the best looking guy I ever dated, but he was the best MAN I ever knew, and when he passed away, you wouldn't believe all the friends he had who showed up to pay their respects.|`|A0nRQHDCaa	I'm already turned off by short guys, so no.    And no I havn't seen many that I would consider attractive even if they had grown half a foot.|`|T55YPfXUaa	my boyfriend is tall ( 6"5) and he is very cute and handsome i must say not because i am with him that i am saying that. he is cute|`|govpgOhqaa	disagreed.  there are some very cute short guys...  but i typically am more attracted to taller guys.  and not the super skinny ones...|`|cxVmq2kraa	Nope!  Tall is sexy.      Help?  http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|ae5e3899eec0749d15858493b9ff0876aa	not really   if you mean stockier like beefer  i dont like super muscley men it grosses me out  it really doesnt matter on the height really to me  as long as they are taller than me   but that is easy because im 5 foot and done growing ha|`|AOkucu5haa	No|`|8KB98h02aa	no;  most tall guys are hott.|`|HvxKb4gIaa	some do. some don't. there are talll guys who are muscular (not too much, like my friends) and short guy who are stick thiiiin, like i see in my classes.    personally, i would go with someone who is at least 5'6", i'm 5'1".|`|67dWrrH9aa	nope guys that are atller are 100x cuter... plus tall girls are cute adn they go ofr tall guys|`|w3Kc0Psaaa	not at all short guys are always ugly.|`|iL0hgvGcaa	tall guys are the sexiest....|`|LDLTjNCraa	Not really.   Smaller boys are sometimes cuter though, but I don't know if it has any relation to height.|`|iMULlxdgaa	Not really...becuase I've seen tall sexy guys and ugly pudgy short dudes too...I guess it just depends on their face and body structure.  Some are too tall and lanky and others are too short and stubby..but some are porportioned just right no matter what their height.
kPiu7O3iaa	I shop at Justice and I personally LOVE it. It has great designs and reasonable prices. Limited Too is okay, but I like Justice a lot more.|`|HZtgNnfPaa	Yeah, the prices at Justice are better, but i think limited too's styles and quality of clothing is soo much better. have you seen Justice's new catalogue for this season, its all ugly animal prints and stuff. ew.|`|Cc8ICAXnaa	I saw at the mall a sign in Limited Too that said "Limited Too is now Justice"|`|DGGNXoXraa	i dont really like any of them and they're pretty much the same thing but i agree with you, justice is better price wise|`|g1Fko1pRaa	No more limited too sorry|`|m1QQwnSdaa	Justice for sure!

Oh wowwwwww.|`|53eb2e3a77a123176238e48eed353879aa	Yeah, actually it kind of does. I'm sure it is real though, and that was just A LOT of touch up with photoshop. It definately looks photoshopped, you can tell from the model's face and skin.|`|ItJhWTCBaa	Wow! That dress does look really fake!

DfDss68haa	Hi! First please look at this  http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types  and let me know what hair type your son is. It would really help me on my advice. Also, do you have another email/contact? You only get a few characters with Yahoo and I have a lot to say. lol  The advice about EVOO is good advice. EVOO is a good conditioner, also a wide tooth comb is helpful. Try plain Olive oil for the same benefits without the smell.    HAIR ROUTINE:  1. No brushing  2. Only comb hair with a WIDE TOOTH comb/fingers WITH conditioner in it. Pain and breakage occurs in curly.kinky hair combed dry. I like Pantene Relaxed and Natural (brown bottle Walmart)  3. He should not shampoo every day. Opinion differs, but in general kinky/curly hair can be washed every other day or every week. Focus on scalp when you do wash. His hair gets clean from run off.  4. Eliminate sulfates from hair products, they build up in curly hair causing frizz.  5. Curly hair eats up moisture. Deep treatments every two weeks, condition everytime you shampoo or even co wash and have a leave in condish every day.   6. Twist/braids at night to avoid tangles.   7. Apply gel after washing hair, this prevents frizz.  8. Plop hair with an micro fiber towel rather than terry cloth.  9. Touch hair very little throughout the day.  10. Most days his hair should be "protected" in styles like braids.  These tips should decrease frizz. NOTE: Hi hair may be kinky which means he will never have "curls" like Jaden Smith but hair that is an afro texture. Just remember his hair is not straight and should not be treated like it.     HAIR PRODUCTS:  1. Ones without sulfates/silicones are best. These are found online Jessicurl, Mixed Chicks, DevaCare, Blended Beauty, Karen Body Beautiful, Kinky Curly Custard are some of the best.  2. Mainstream products for his hair: Pantene, Herbal Essences, Suave, and Clairol are the best. Pantene is great because it makes detangling a breeze. Terri @ biracialhair.org has great advice on washing and conditioning.  http://biracialhair.org/CurlyPrimer.aspx  3. Styling helpers: gels like LA Looks or Fantasia IC, setting lotions, nut butters like shea butter, leave in conditioner.    Conditioner, conditioner, conditioner, his hair will be very porous (curly hair is) so it will gain/lose moisture fast. Conditioners seal moisture in. Dry hair is more brittle, tangly, and frizzy. While still wet apply a condish.    Definitely go to Terri's site on biracial hair. Product advice, detangling tips, styling tips etc. http://biracialhair.org/Welcome.aspx    Before and after on many mixed children:  http://biracialhair.org/BeforeAndAfter.a...    Great youtube natural users:  http://www.youtube.com/user/richeau  http://www.youtube.com/user/curlychronic...  http://www.youtube.com/user/rusticbeauty...    DETANGLING TECHNIQUE:  1. Soak his hair in the shower.  2. Apply a slippery conditioner like Pantene Relaxed and Natural liberally throughout. You can do this before or after shampooing. Don't be stingy, his hair needs lots of product.   3. Take a section with a wide tooth comb and start at bottom and work your way up to the roots. Do not go from roots to tips as this will cause breakage, tangles, and pain. Take your time, his hair is very fragile which is why it should only be detangled when wet with conditioner. Do this throughout his hair until completely detangled. Do this at least once a week.   4. Wash out conditioner, apply leave in conditioner.  5. Put into protective hair style most days. You can leave hair but make sure it has a leave in moisturizer in it.  A protective hairstyle is anything where the hair is constrained and/or ends are covered. His hair is too prone to tangles and breakage to leave out every day. Braids, cornrows, and twists are all examples of protective hairstyles    Hope that helped. If you have any other questions feel free to email me. Also check out all the below websites.|`|vi2bzq0Caa	Jayden is adorable. I am so glad that you post this question because I receive a lot of questions similar to yours in my email from parents of biracial children or from parents who are biracial. I offer them all different advice that tailors to their hair type and texture.   Okay...this is going to be a long one.    I can determine, based on the information that you have given, that your son probably has Type 3 hair and a moderately kinky texture. To receive further information about the hair type that I have indicated above, visit this website www.treasuredlocks.com    I want to give you all the help that you need. Email me at awhet087@ymail.com for a consultation.|`|WkqagpZmaa	he can still take showers without washing his hair...  and i would suggest a shine serum run through his hair once or twice a week, and do like the doc said and dont wash it too much.|`|jAc7AgOiaa	Why don't you invest in some texture softener,    http://www.texturesoftener.com/    there's girls on the box but I don't think it's limited to them lol.  Or you could find some for guys in a beauty supply store.|`|OEaqkDdVaa	Just give him showers, without shampooing his hair every time!|`|FfeKzUycaa	I am black and my hair used to be like this.  I got tired of it and relaxed it.  What I did was wash mine everyday, used a nice leave in conditioner (to keep it from drying) and an oil moisturizer. In the morning it doesn't look so great, but once it's dries it looks nice.  After you wash it don't comb through it.  You can comb through before you wash it.  If you comb it after you wash it you are basicly seperating the curls and you want the curls to lock.  What you will be doing for the first month is training his hair.  I honestly combed through mine once every two weeks with conditioner in it.  You will learn to style it as time goes.  Hope this helps =)!|`|cyD5Hb1jaa	Well i have almost Similar hair like in the pic.  my hair are more loose curls. Wash his hair with shampoo and conditioner once a week. NOT 2 WEEKS.    also try deep conditioner every other week and rinse off any will work. with a wide tooth comb comb his hair gently and let it air dry but if u want to be like Jaden hair put DOVES moose while its wet and air dry.

7tzxiW66aa	being pale myself i have always found that white bathing suits look awesome, because they make you look tanner.  anything that is darker than your skin will make you look paler.  i think the yellow stripe, or the plain yellow is would be the best.

I made the mistake of messing with one, and now i'm left with a mark. If it's just red use visine, it gets rid of the redness. Dip a cotton ball with visine, then apply to the area, leave it on for 30 seconds, then remove.
I9L0FUogaa	Nothing really dark, because you'll look ghostly. You should play is safe and go for solids. If you have a kind of average skin tone, an orange-ish yellow could create a nice contrast.     If you're so pale that it's already hopeless (sorry) then you should play that up so that you don't look pale so much as porcelain. Emerald green might give that effect...I'm pale as hell myself, and I wear a green and white bikini.

leTSzyflaa	I love ringlets too, try this link. http://www.momofmany.com/2008/07/how-to-...  Good luck. Peace ? L?ve|`|D0OBjou4aa	I don't know if this makes loose ringlets but this is how to use rags. You need to get some strips of fabric, then you get a piece of hair and twist it until when you kind of push it towards your head it goes into a neat little bun thingy. Then you need to tie it up with the rag so it stays there and sleep on it overnight. It's really uncomfortable to sleep on but it makes you hair ringletty. Be sure to spray it with hairspray so it lasts longer.|`|ilLxH6ftaa	i want to know this too :)  all i know is that old pillowcases cut into strips are a good cloth to use.|`|DMzH5kbkaa	You can do them with rollers but you'd have to have the really big sized ones; then you just hairspray them and put heat on them for about 5 minutes; you'd need to get a good hairspray though which holds but doesn't go hard! (they do exist, just a bit more expensive).  I've seen people have it done so it does work, just takes a bit of time to get them. It's easier to get smaller ringlets and use smaller rollers but to get loose ringlets, you just don't put the rollers in as tight :) then it will work fine. Just use heat!|`|riiyZtA1aa	RAGS      Tear an old sheet or other soft cloth into strips. These strips can be from 1 to 5 inches wide and from 8 to 18 inches long, depending on the type of curls desired.   Separate your hair in the back as if you were going to do a double braid. Slip one side in a loose side pony tail.   Grasp the end of a strand of hair with the center of the rag folded over it.   Curl the strand around the rag to the underneath.      Paper towel strips shownTie the loose ends of the rag on top when you reach the scalp. If you make a hard knot, you will probably have to cut the rags off in the morning.|`|Y8UICH0Daa	my mother, when i was little used to tie strips of hair around a piece of cloth, in small sections, whilst my hair was damp, i think you wind the hair around the cloth so it spirals down, quite firm, as firm as you can so they hold, and tie the ends together at the top, and sleep with them in, by the time your hair is dry and you wake up, undo the cloth and your sorted!    good luck.|`|dxeb0BfBaa	there are 3 different ways:    1.Rag rolling- use a strip of cloth & wrap the hair around it then tie it in a knot to hold the hair. take small sections for tighter ringlets    2.Using rollers/curlers     3.Using a curling tongs or stick, wrap the hair around & hold for no more than 10 secs.    1 & 2 are the safest & should be done at night time before you go to bed with wet hair..    3 is the handiest & quickest
m01ijLFUaa	The 1st one.  Try going more natural - make-up & poses etc.    You could increase the contrast, enhance the colour, maybe crop some of the background out .    Then maybe make it black and white, but not sepia as it will make it look like an old picture and wont achieve a fashion image !  :D|`|yr1685V1aa	u r stunning but LESS make up no offence but it makes u look cheap but u r reallyy pretty 1 is probs the best|`|f8ImzaJlaa	The first one deffiantly:)  I dont think you need to edit them?:)|`|Q5FYrU9vaa	i think the first one is better|`|OFNmZbPCaa	1|`|czAbrzcUaa	1st is a little better but you have toomuch make up on.

(Keep it out)  Next:  tone down the eyeliner like 300%    You're actually not bad looking but how you've been presenting yourself lately detracts from your appearance.  1st pic is slightly better.|`|pAsdcjcoaa	i like the first better both nice though :)|`|LkMeHaWsaa	first-lighten it up|`|4TssH9WQaa	The first one looks like you have tons of attitude an the second one you look sort of, in a way, angelic maybe. so i would say the best one fo attitude is one and angelic number two.|`|F2LI7zjraa	1st, you could make it black and white|`|CnHIHCwtaa	i hate the eye makeup but if i had to pick it would be the second one|`|Kjee66zMaa	i love the 1st one nice makeup|`|O99zUD9faa	i like the first one try a sepia tone|`|2Q1cRwKaaa	the 1st one looks awesome.|`|ZKAuHN2taa	1|`|FyCT8pSFaa	I'd choose number 1|`|iHGnTrYhaa	1st one.

There are no crystals along the seams at the hem or close to the neck, and they get denser closer to the waist, this suggests that someone added them after the dress was made.  Here's The Creative Crystal website with the Bejeweler tool. I got mine from this site and I use it all the time. http://www.creativecrystal.com/default.a...

0fhCbS7Daa	I believe you have a girlfriend and you can always ask her. Easy answer to your question huh?|`|4w8HTtmyaa	That is the weirdest thing i have every heard, by women you are talking collectivley and not to all women, some women dont have a problem with them, however some women are as you said self conscious, however by you asking that its like a women asking why are men so self conscious of there knees, now you yourself may not be however some men are! See i said men which is as a collective, not you!|`|yUgg0lPjaa	Because if they show through trousers its anoying cos you get this line on your butt|`|9jKfeIUgaa	if you really are jesus, wouldn't you already know the answer?|`|EPaYoJaiaa	I'm slightly confused. You just said exactly why women are self conscious about pantylines, cause they're not tasteful. They're tacky, they're annoying, they're unattractive the list goes on my friend.|`|VrjF986Aaa	because a visible panty line is very sloppy and unattractive looking|`|2f05f1797218d6d460cdf8e06af0c251aa	?
TPpTAKAdaa	Experiment with different conditioners.  Garnier (in the bright green bottle) really helps with frizziness and poofiness.  Also, I find it easier to tame my hair when wet, so I always shower in the mornings.
5fdgfNCRaa	I have medium brown eyes and light skin and I think that it'd work for you too... I use dark brown liner on the bottom but just on the lash line/ edge of the lower lid and then some of the same on the upper lid on the same edge part but ONLY the 1/4 of it closest to your nose - none above the lashes on the top lid! Then I use black mascara (an eyelash curler first is a MUST) and I think it's really pretty. If you use eyeliner on the top lid like behind the lashes, your lashes don't stand out as much against your skin. You can use a shimmery shadow, I use a light beige color so I don't look like I got smacked in the face with a makeup box... too much color and stuff isn't sexy. I guess this is the sexiest way I know of without looking overdone!|`|0mAeM1zGaa	Compliment your brown eyes with pale pinks, or accent the brown with gold and deep rusts.

I am almost a ghost so I just got the lightest shade. You can see the color through the bottle so it is really not too hard to find the correct shade. Plus with the mineral make up I find that you don't have to be exact in the shade, only close. It does not go on like the liquid or pressed powder foundations. It is a lighter coverage compared to the other forms of foundation, but I have acne and oily skin, so a heavy coverage is not really what I need. Try them, I think you might like them.|`|78588e3257514586ce18e14f16018f9eaa	Loreal makes great products.  They are owned by the same company as Lancome.

But anyway i have been wanting t curl it so now i think curly is better :)|`|kBrUzwiGaa	I know exactly what you mean. I have been straightening my hair for a couple of years now, and when it was curly, I got TONS of compliments. But I don't completely straighten it. My curls were pretty tight and sometimes hard to style, so I just use a gentle relaxer and my hair has a loose curl now, which still looks great. Try that if you're not sure.

But if your feeling uncomfortable, try a dress that's tightest under your bust line and flows outwards like this:   http://shopimages-pe.delias.com/153154_b...  It'll cover up any problems you might have with your tummy, and its in style. :)  If your uncomfortable with your legs, try tights with a control top.    I truly think you have a great body though, you could look nice in a lot of things. Try the dresses at Delias.com|`|AChxe6ltaa	Don't listen to their comments, you look fine...

OpdHN6Ivaa	Usually us Asian people like to think outside of the box. We like to dress up and explore different aspects of fashion.   I don't really have a website for you to go to. But just go to your everyday stores and pair them with something that you wouldn't believe could have worked out. Or it looks strikingly cool without even knowing it could be like that. I once took a batman shirt and paired it with leather leggings. I got compliments all day on how cool it looked. Also,  If your a guys you can get an Asian hair cut and style it up. Or if your a girl i would either get my hair all layered or just wear it differently to match the look your going for.  You can also take a black and white jacket wear black tank top underneath and something that has bright colors that just pop out.   You can also pair bright colors with bright colors just make sure they somehow mesh together.  Or take black and white plaid pants or jacket and wear bright green under them.|`|UKqMSYDIaa	yesstyle.com   is actually popular store in asia that teens shop at

If it's those incredibly baggy pants with all the chains and pockets, then the only thing you can wear with those is a band t-shirt, and a pair of black shoes. If it happens to be a pair of Tripp skinny jeans, then I recommend a good fitting t-shirt, studded belt, and and some flats.|`|dFHHsjCDaa	get normal pants! problem solved.|`|hjjmcbbPaa	personally i think that trip pants can only go with band t shirts or skulls if your lookin to look like that|`|7l0Ug8ISaa	tripp pants go nicely with stuff like fishnets, tank tops, or hoodies, as far as jewelry goes, leather bracelets or collars with spikes or studs are always good to complete the look.|`|g1Fko1pRaa	http://www.bewild.com/giprt.html                   heres some options|`|KF4yFRFtaa	Some kind of Graphic Tee shirt.

OK5npm9Taa	NO DO NOT BRAID IT! then the ends will be very crimped looking and it will look a bit fried. (no offense to whoever said that)  What you need is a triple-barrel curling iron. I bought one and it makes my hair look just like that i got mine at tj maxx. it's by jibierre de paris. it works like a crimper but it ends up looking like the pics  I love it! I haven't used it since i got my hair cut (shoulder length now) but when it was about boob-length i had alot of layers and it took about 20 minutes for that exact look. also my hair has very little natural wave so that might help the time. =]  good luck!!|`|bDolQsPhaa	Try washing your hair the night before you do curl it, curls hold better if your hair is a little dirty.    First, use a heat protectant in your hair to keep the curl in tact for as long as possible and also to protect your hair from the damages that hot irons can cause.     The curl in the pics look more like a "zigzag" or "s" wave, not a ringlet curl. So, you're going to want to curl your hair with a straightener.    There are different ways to curl your hair with a straightener, but the one I find works the best for this particular looks would be to clasp your hair, rotate it 180 degrees, and pull it straight down.    The flat iron will hold the curl longer than a curling iron usually does.  Hair spray you're hair with a flexible hairspray after curling, so that it retains the curl, but keeps it softer.    Finish off the look with some frizz-ease serum to ensure that you're hair is glossy, but not greasy, and the curls will look their best.    This process takes some practice, so don't be discouraged right away. Practice on your hair a couple of times before you do it for going out, or whatever the occasion is.   Curling your hair with a straightener works best with a 1" straightener, not the wider ones.     If you want more of a hands-on instructional video, search for "curling your hair with a straightener" on youtube, and you should come up with some good vids.    Good Luck!|`|3n3EcqTIaa	i did that once.  i put it into a zillion small braids while it was wet,  and slept with them in.  in the morning i just took them out  and did my usual hair routine.  it turned out okay :)|`|2I5XqMDzaa	braid it|`|Z4HD1hgFaa	the girl on the left is aly michalka and you can put your hair into large rollers and let it dry. then tease the curls/waves with your fingers a bit.|`|Ot5x2C3baa	Get a medium sized or bigger sized curling iron and hair spray afterwards. Make sure to have the curls going away from your face on both sides.|`|Jt1gWWzXaa	put you hair in large braids then got to sleep with them in and then wake up, brush your hair, maybe add a little hair spray and your hair should be perfect :)    hope i helped :D

B4lMcm89aa	A real agency won't ask you to pay for anything. You are most likely being scammed.|`|4XYjZNWeaa	A proper agency will not ask you for any money  whatsoever!  I applyed to be a diesel model and i got it but then they asked for 50 pounds for my photos and stuff.So i didnt do it. Go on google and type in modelling agencies too.They'll all pretty much say DO NOT PAY    hopethis helps  xx

BzFKTbYhaa	If you catch one of their specials, then Men's Warehouse is a good spot to get a good suit.  However, if you don't catch their sales then you will be paying out the nose.  However, when Men's Warehouse has a special, it tends to only cover "specific" items and not everything in the store.      If you need to save a bit of money, check out JC Penney.  Yeah, not "high end" but you can get a decent suit at a decent price.      I currently own a suit from Men's Warehouse.  It cost around $400 and came with one jacket and two pairs of slacks.  I purchase dress shirts from the mall, as I've found the dress shirts from Men's Warehouse require a lot of extra work to keep looking nice.  (IE: I prefer shirts that do not require dry cleaning.)      Always remember to dry clean your jacket and slacks together, so that they "wear" the same.  Store your new suit with cedar hangers, mothballs, etc. to protect it!  (I learned the hard way and lost a really nice tie when moths got to it.)      Good luck!|`|VuaOKpYXaa	Here are some of them  http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-...

You should definitely go with the Sedu though.  (: best wishes!

Oq6pxX3jaa	Haha I have the same problem, with the same kind of jeans. I haven't found a good way, besides pulling them up while I'm sitting down.  This will help them stay up longer, and it is a bit more discreet, yet not as much as i would like.  If you figure it out will you let me know as well?      EDIT: Don't listen to the people who said to get some that fits. I'm sure those jeans are your size and still doing it, since thats how mine are.|`|ajeMVARraa	Uhmmm... if they're that tight, you shouldn't be wearing them... Even tight, skinny jeans should have a little tiny bit of room to like, breath or move. I guess just go in the bathroom and inch them up, like tights. Start just below your knee and pinch the fabric and move it up that way. Or just stop wearing ridiculous pants. Sorry to be blunt, but come on!|`|ERRnwjLMaa	oh that happens to me all the time, even with a belt. :/  another size isn't gonna help you, fyi. hahah.  umm there's not really any solution, but what i do when i wear hollister jeans is wear a long waisted shirt or sweatshirt or something with it.    hope i helped (:|`|PK9R1V8gaa	i just pretend to be adjusting my shirt/pulling it down and then i kinda grab the waistband of my jean and pull them up~it actully works :)|`|GEyJMsaKaa	Some people can't wear low rise b/c they may not have the right hips to keep them up.With all due respect,I just don't think you have the hip frame to wear low rise jeans.It's okay,I'm like that too. Low rise jeans are supposed to sit on you're hips,and most girls depend on their hips to keep their jeans on.    Really,it's not a bad thing.Most girls are just like that. :)    And hollister jeans ARE low rise,all of them are. So to wear low rise skinny jeans,just select a different brand( I prefer Old Navy and Abercrombie) and wear a belt with the jeans.    Oh,and sense you're only 14,you will probably end up with the right hip frame in a couple of years.Some girls just have to wait to grow into them.    Hope I helped :)|`|aROel4yzaa	Get a size that actually fits, or thats tight on you.  Didn't you already ask this question?  Idk but anyways. Hope I helped (:|`|2v60zG5Faa	wash them quite a few times and wear them around the house|`|0b774fc7f91bfc0189f12a4d73cf6d26aa	idk about a way to pull them up, but with my jeans that are loose at the waist i just fold like half an inch of it inside and sew it|`|di6p10Ifaa	All of those name brands are actually made incredibly cheap and on form fitting models that are unrealistic sizes. Go somewhere like Dillards or JCPenny and find jeans. The brands carried there are more realistically crafted and better quality. You are going to find that you are always going to have this problem with this brand of jeans. Bottom line it sounds like you are buying your jeans about a size too small. Don't worry about the size. People would rather see a girl wearing pants that fit rather than someone squeezing into a pair of jeans that don't fit just because you care about the numbers on the inside of the pant. Remember, no one sees the tags. By squeezing yourself into jeans that don't fit you are actually making yourself look bigger. Why pay so much money for a pair of jeans that does have a long enough crotch. You are probably long waisted. Low rise jeans are a joke. My sister is about the only person I know that can wear low rise jeans and look good, then again she is 5'0 and short waisted. Low rise jeans tend to make a "muffin top" on people with average length of waist.|`|AUQKyiefaa	Find a pair of jeans that actually fits you correctly, or get a different size? I don't have this problem with my Hollister jeans.|`|y3F4dfEmaa	when i need to pull my pants up i just do it. i rlly dont care. people like me and think im hot and if they have a problem with me its there problem. :-p
y0bcS3OIaa	I have tried just about everything that Benefit has.  They have cute packaging and some of their products are very ingenius.  Here's my little breakdown...    Bad Girl Lash--I reall don't like this mascara.  The brush is way too big and it may be hard to get mascara on all your lashes, especially the corners.  Besides that I don't think its as good with volumizing as some of the other mascaras I have tried, for example, Lancome's definicils.      Boi-iog Concealer--industrial strength and it is definitely one of the best concealers I've tried for its price and size.  This is not a concealer for under your eyes or for any acne bumps.  For discoloration like freckles and scars, this is awesome.  You should use a liquid foundation after using this though.    Creamy Eyeshadows--These rock.  The consistency is amazing.  It goes on smooth and it doesn't crease.  The colors have a little sheen to it but I think it adds to the total effect.      High Brow--Biggest waste of money ever.  Its just like a crayon and quite clumsy like a crayon.  When you put it on, you'll need to smudge it or it looks stupid.  When you smudge it, it will just ruin your eyeshadow.  A lighter eyeshadow shade would do the same thing "High Brow" claim.    Dr. Feelgood--is the good if you have large pores and oily skin, if not, there's no point of you getting this.  It helps tighten pores and it keeps you matte throughout the day.  Well somewhat, I got a bit oily after half a day.  Btw, it doesn't smell *** too great.  Reminds me of some sort of medicine balm.    Benetint--This is a definite.  It's a nice lip stain especially if you dont want something heavy like lipstick or glossy like lipgloss.  You can also control the amount of color you put on your lips by either putting more or less.  I don't recommend using it as a cheek stain.  It's a bit harder to "control" when you use it on your skin.    BrowGel--I think that is what it is called.  It's a decent product, although I have found better.  Anastasia's brow gel has much more pigment in it, which is what I rather have.      That's what I could think of off the top of my head.  Hope it helps.|`|a002ffcbd40afa45e8f5b3068f771ffcaa	bad gal lash...awesome! benetint is great, and so is dr. feelgood!|`|j8Gzcc6paa	bad gal lash  it rockssss  and all of their products are just awesome i have the kitty sparkly powder|`|pmqK7oGIaa	i like benefit silky finish lipstick. the shade good to go was used on kristen stewart in twilight|`|Sr1kywKFaa	If you have darker areas around your eyes, the eye brightening crayon is fantastic. A little goes a long way under your makeup. You get a nice bright eyed look.|`|Fsq9qvkqaa	You should definitely get High Beam, it is amazing what it can do. It gives your skin a glowy, dewy look that is very flattering :]  I also like their Big Beautiful Eyes kit.
o6hKaeMxaa	That's cute. I really like dark nails, but only when they're short [otherwise they get a bit dracula-esque.] The deep purple is nice for valentine's day, but won't look weird afterwards. Last year one of the girls in my bio class polished her pink with dark pink hearts on them. it was cute on the day when everyone dressed up, but the next day it was just a touch weird.    guys may or may not notice that your nails are purple for valentine's day. they'll notice your nails look nice and shiny and pretty, but i doubt most of them will get the reference. :]|`|WMhhmWBWaa	ii would get a pink or a red. or even get like white with a red or pink like underneath. do you know what im tryint to say ?|`|HwaAAIOEaa	Yay for purple!|`|Tcku8YpGaa	it sounds really nice. :]  especially since the color's not ugly, and becaue the nails aren't too long..    it at least shouldn't look tacky, i can say that for sure :D  go for it!|`|auV6OLVDaa	pretty =)|`|OLyKEracaa	yes, im going to copy you!  :)
vi2bzq0Caa	On average, hair grows approximately half of an inch per month. So, to answer your question, hair will grow two inches within two months. This, of course, does not include one's styling methods, nor whether or not the hair is in a healthy state to begin with. I recommend that if your hair is damaged or it has a slow growth rate (due to genetics or a poor diet), trying taking vitamin supplements that include iron, B-complex, calcium, and zinc. Intake Wild Alaskan Salmon and bananas with leafy green vegetables. Also purchase Hairfinity Hair Vitamins [side note- the site may portray products specifically made for African Americans but the vitamins are for anyone and everyone].|`|iiRU9kEoaa	If you have a good diet, exercise, drink lots of water, get trims and take care of your hair properly it would grow about 1 inch per month. If not then it would grow around 1/2 inches.    There are many debates about cutting your split ends will make it grow faster or some people just say it wont grow at all. Your hair grows from your scalp, that is true but split ends break off so you can't grow your hair as fast. So just get a trim 1-2 months :)|`|0Awd4VYWaa	it's different for everyone|`|hOT4f7Fjaa	lyk 2-3    if u drink milk alot..thts a reason y ur hair can grow face :]|`|wM0Jce76aa	The average rate is about 1/2" each month.|`|QClFoSNhaa	on average text books sais your hair grows half inch every month|`|CfXLUEn8aa	You're hair grows about 1/2 inch every month. So about 2 inches would be how much it would grow in 4 months.|`|JvY5KL22aa	my hair grows really fast! but everyone is different.|`|m8A8rj2Qaa	it varies but an estimate would be 2 inches.  hair usually gros a 1/2 in every month.|`|bvfO59vaaa	Well it depends if your hair grows fast or not, like for me mine grows fast so it would probably be a few inch's. So if your hair normaly grows fast then its prolly like my mine|`|VUGrTwhvaa	just about 2 or 3 inches average cause your hair grows half an inch per every month unless your hair grows super fast or super slow.|`|OHfUqAf7aa	no idea... i'm wondering the same thing.. lol XD
yhkEyVXLaa	If you don't really like carrying a bag or purse at the moment, then I don't think I would invest in that one or really any.  When you get your license, credit cards/bank card, insurance card, etc., that is when you definitely will need one. Until then invest in a wristlet or a swing pack of some sort.  I am going to post up pictures from the coach website (they may be out of price range which is okay, just to get some ideas) that you may like.  However, when you do get a bag/purse, try a small shoulder one to get the hang of it and then branch out.  You will also want one that is more sturdy and structured than loose and baggy looking (items will be all over the place and hard to find/get out).   http://www.coach.com/content/product.asp...  http://www.coach.com/content/product.asp...  Just for some ideas.  Hope this helps.|`|xYtTpZtKaa	its okay, but hobo bags look really good in bright colors like pink and yellow|`|CAdFHF9zaa	you dont sound enthused,  find something you really like,  try colors?|`|F5T5P1Ueaa	it's fine. if you're going to get it get it in olive.  maybe you'll like these better:  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...|`|U3zY6kcZaa	yea it is plain but if you buy it..get it in black.    i would buy one with more color indeed.

YEd9Q5KZaa	You should use some detangler(sp?), it actually works.|`|jUWOMgyuaa	Use bed head products|`|7a63286baf5e33622b08a4aa5f6c9dceaa	Pantene Pro-V will leave your hair clean, and manageable without being dry. For the greasy look you are talking about, I would get some IC hair polisher. That way it does not matter what type of shampoo you use.
VrjF986Aaa	go strapless, nothing can ruin a nice formal look like visible bra straps which always look trashy|`|d2mWHSqlaa	You don't have to go strapless but make sure your bra straps are thin. If I were you though, I'd get a bra with removable straps and put clear straps on.|`|D94Mqkxkaa	if i were you i would go strapless because it will look better with your spaghetti straps.|`|Ao5aSAWiaa	There are skin tone bras that you can try, or even the plasticy clear straps. If those are uncomfortable though, you can buy a strapless bra or even try sillicon sticks, but I don't know how well those would work for you. I would go with a strapless just to be safe.
e83c5229e243a4223beeb3c6e55aac65aa	How to Sell on eBay    Selling on eBay is as easy as going through a few steps. It's user friendly and can always be edited. Here's how you can sell on eBay. If there are any questions you can always go to the "Help" section of the site.    Instructions:    Step 1. Sign up. Assuming you haven't yet signed up yet, go to eBay's Main Pageand then click on register at the very top of the page to create an eBay account.   You will also need to sign up for a PayPal account.  Sign up for PayPal first, as it will take a day or so to complete the registration process for PayPal.    Step 2. Build your account. It's a very good idea to buy a few things and pay immediately so that you will get some feedback ratings. (Don't buy things to resell, just buy things you'd buy anyway.) This will give you experience with the site and start to build up your "site cred".     -Search eBay for items like those you want to sell. Read the listings. What sort of information or photos do you find most helpful to you as a potential buyer? What makes you think a seller is trustworthy?     Step 3. Assemble the information you will need to place the listing. Usually this includes measuring the item, weighing the item so you can estimate shipping costs, and having your photos ready.     Step 4. Log in and go to Sell either in My eBay or on the Main Page at the top.     Step 5. Enter the title and description, after choosing a category. Be very detailed about your product, and include as many pictures as possible.  The more pictures, the better your item will sell.  Not including one will deter a lot of buyers from your item.     Step 6. Continue to go through the options, and be sure to look everything over very carefully. There's a lot to look through and you'll want to make sure everything is correct.  Do not waste your money by opting for the "upgrades" for your listing.  In 10 years of selling, I have never upgraded any of my listings and have done great.     Step 7. Double check everything before saving. Be sure that when you're done with everything at the end (you're at the overview page) to double check and press submit. If you don't press submit it won't be entered. You'll then get an e-mail confirming that your product was placed on eBay.     Step 8. Watch the auction. Once the item has been shipped, and they have left feedback for you, you should leave feedback for that person.     *Tips*    -Consider using a photo hosting service to add extra pictures to your listing for free.  If you use the ebay photo hosting service, the first photo is free, each additional picture is .15 cents.  I use Seller's Sourcebook for all of my listings.  I can choose from over 1000 different auction templates, add as many pictures as I want and I can even upload my listings to ebay from the Seller Sourcebook site.   Every one of my listings look very professional and I am proud to show my items using a professionally designed template.  Other photo hosting sites are Inkfrog and Photobucket.  There is a charge for Inkfrog, but Photobucket is free.  -You need to have excellent feedback to sell well on eBay.     -Sell inexpensive items to build up your feedback first.    -As long as you follow the directions and press submit at the end, your product will be viewable to everyone.   It can take up to 12 hours for your item to show up under the general search.    -Always answer a customer's questions promptly. Be clear, direct, and friendly.     -Be sure to choose the correct category and keywords... the easier it is for your customer to find you, the better it will sell!     -You will have to ship the product out on your own, so you're going to have to add shipping into the price; there's a section where you set the shipping.     -You can always go back and edit it if you don't like something. Just go into "My eBay" and go from there.   Once a bid in placed on  your item, you cannot edit any information in your listing.  You can add to the description, you just cannot edit the main body of your description.    -Keep good communication with your customer - they're interested in your product and you want to be ranked as a good seller in the end, so be a good seller!     -Try and have it so your auction ends on a Sunday. Avoid ending auctions on Friday or Saturday when people are not home to bid.     -Avoid using "reserve price" auctions. These auctions are a form of shill bidding where the bidders are bidding against the seller himself. A reserve auction makes some buyers angry because they have no idea what the seller wants. Instead, set the opening bid at the lowest amount of money you would be willing to sell the item for.     -Help keep the feedback system honest by only placing honest feedback and avoiding the "trading" of positive feedback. A seller should leave positive feedback if the buyer pays promptly. A buyer should leave positive feedback if the item arrives in a reasonable time and is as advertised. A seller who waits for a buyer to leave positive feedback is really trading feedback. Such a practice skews feedback ratings.  Also, realize that a seller cannot leave a negative feedback for buyers any more.  So, ensuring that your description in your listing is honest and you ship on time, will help you maintain a positive feedback rating and keep your 30 day DSR stars in good standing.    -People will look at things that have cheap or free shipping, so include the shipping price in the total price (or min bid) and people will be more inclined to buy. If you offer it, make sure they know that you're offering it.     -Packaging is also important. If items are fragile, improper packaging can result in broken items and unhappy customers! Also keep in mind the price you pay for shipping: the box, padding, etc., to decide on a reas|`|1cfd26f25289a1245a86fe8db1bf3dc2aa	You will be able to choose how long your item stays for sale. Also, if they do sell, you will be charged..depending on how much they sell for...

And you can always read the FAQ's and help screens if you have more questions.|`|GZOvmY3uaa	i don't know, but u could go 2 best buy and they have a disk tht shows u how 2 sell stuff on ebay, only 4 $10.00. tax isn't much. good luck!

c8tyG5z3aa	Try putting darker eyeshadow on the outsides of your eye and lighter on the inside, or try something like this product:  http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Eye/Ey...    They can make your eyes look bigger if you apply it right, directions are on the back of the case. I use those quad eyeshadow things and I love them :)  I put liquid eyeliner (it can take a lot of practice to get it right) on my top lid, then I take black eyeshadow and go over the eyeliner to make it look sort of smokey. This can make your eyes look bigger, too.    Also, when putting eyeliner on the bottom part of your eye, don't put it on your waterline. Put it below your waterline, like on your lash line.  What I do is I use liquid on the bottom too. I apply it on my lashline, not on my waterline, and if I mess up I take a q-tip, get it wet with makeup remover, and just take away the parts that I don't want.    It's easy if you practice :)|`|iKK89z2Eaa	if you have small eyes you shouldnt be putting eye liner on your top eyelids only on your bottom lids. apply a light eye shadow up to your brow bone and darker eye shadow closer to your eye, this will make your eyes appear bigger and bolder. good luck :]|`|toPAXum8aa	first of all. you shouldnt stereotype races like that because im sure not every chinese have small eyes.    wear yours shadows bigger|`|MfuUAcNwaa	nothing to dark or you eye will look beaty.I would recommend switching to brow eye liner it gives the same effect as the black and look just as nice.and the brand I would recommend is mac.mac has best make up in the world!!|`|NqEw4skBaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4GVBkicn...
8osMkLe1aa	Wash your feet twice a day and use a foot spray like Dr. Scholl's Odour Destroyers Deodorant Spray. To make your shoes smell better Febreze them and if it's not snowy where you are leave them outside to air out. The sun can help kill the bacteria that's causing the odour. You could also spray the inside of your shoes with Lysol or something if Febreze doesn't do the job.|`|NCl7B7diaa	Try sprinkling some baby powder in your shoes while you wear them. Heard that helps. or they have special foot and shoe powders you can use.|`|zwSHBAgEaa	My first question in turn would be, "Are you wearing cotton socks?"  My son had an obtrusive odor b/c he often went w/o socks then when he did they were these thin puny styles.  Since he started wearing cotton socks regularly, there is no odor.    My second idea if washing them has not worked, then try airing them out in a dry and possibly hotter environment.  I have found this helps me since I play basket ball and sweat a lot.     Another great use is Medicated Gold Bond or a generic.  Put some in your shoes before you wear them and then again after you remove them and the powder soaks the odor and gives you a nice clean scent.    It is not a crime to have stinky, it is only a crime to accept it as normal.  Take care and best wishes.  Mom to someone

I couldn't find the ingredients for the Nars Bronzing Powder but if it has talc as a main ingredient then you would want to avoid it as well. A lot of mineral makeup is talc free like physicians formula and bare escentuals but I'm not sure what they have in the line of bronzers. Hope this helped!

Oh wow....lol. I agree with the person who said go to a thrift store.....and heres what you can do...google pictures of Jakie Onasis (The late first lady of President Kennedy)....the cute black dress and the big black sunshades and you can get white gloves or somethin and a cute wig or do your hair in a style with a high tease in the top. If your mom lets you wear make up for this event go heavy on the eyeliner...like the smokey eye look and a cute pastel lip color. That was hot in the 60's. So there you have a 60's theme and its also dressy....the 70's and 80's were more of a hippie punk rock type era so it really wouldnt be appropiate to rock that style if the party is a fancy dress type party. Good luck hun your friend needs a party planner sounds like to me...she has too much goin on.

HrYRC8uPaa	I saw a few in Blue Banana a couple of months ago, though I'm not sure if there's one near you. Best thing you can do is to check their website and see if they deliver.

mtFPjUNLaa	I have plain boring brown hair and i just recently put red highlights in. mine haven't truned orange or pink or anything like that because my hair wasn't bleached before it. if your hair does turn true orange than i would go back and say that you want your hair dyed all one color. also.. dying your hair many times damages it a lot. use Suave Proffessional shampoo. it works GREAT!! lol i use it and it's not expensive either. hope everything works out for you.|`|EdU7u08vaa	Yes she bleached it so it would be that vibrant red. if she just put it over your black hair it wouldnt show at all. But red is the hardest color to keep from fading esp when its not natural. I would suggest gettin fusion hair extenstions this way the color will never fade and you can take them out when your sick of them. If thats not an option then youll jus have to recolor them monthly when they start to fade|`|FyfkOHpyaa	With dark hair, it will always be bleached for a lighter color. It needs to be.  It will fade no matter what. Even when you fix it. Try to buy a shampoo that protects colored hair. That might keep it from fading so quickly.|`|DooTqB9daa	once you bleach ur hair color wont hold long sorry|`|rTXCvu9Saa	yes it is right that she bleached it first, all thats happened is that the red highlights are fading so the bleach is coming through so it looks kind of orange.  Next time you go to the hair dressers tell her about it and she can use a stronger dye on your hair so it will last longer :)    Trust me, I bleached my hair blonde and then re-dyed it back and after a bit the bleach was coming back through and nows it's a sort of golden colour lol :) xx|`|8RLv9SvDaa	Well if you actually want the red to show up on dark hair like your you have to bleach it. I'm guessing you're not using a color treated shampoo, even if it's highlights you still have artificial color in your air, so use it. If you ARE using color treated shampoo and it's still fading try a product like pantene color say, they have this products in all brands so search a round. Or maybe it was just a bad dye job and you should go somewhere else.

dduWesM5aa	nice, i agree with your prefrences. if your short on cash definetly go with an ibanez rg. esp and schecter are my personal favorites, but esps, are going to be about $1000. so for $600 i'd say go with a schecter, more specifically a tempest custom or tempest hellraiser.   personally if i were you i'd save up another $400 and get an esp ec 1000, but those schecters are great two.     best pickups: Emg 81/85 also refered to as the zack wylde set, almost every metal band there is uses these. i prefer seymour duncan blackouts, because they are heavier and more natural sounding. also seymour duncan dimebuckers are good ( dimebag's pickups) and so are dimarzios.    Best Body/ Neck wood: definetly mahogany, it provides a heavier, warmer sound, all 5 of my guitars are mahogany.     Tuning keys: Grover locking tuners for sure, my guitars with these babies, literally go out of tune maybe once every 6 months.
gx7s1M5gaa	It is probably not black, but really just a very dark shade of blue so when you put it on, you see the true color.|`|fMPyLqW4aa	It's probably a navy blue but looks black so when you put it on your lids it's blue.|`|JPLbqzglaa	Mold?|`|A7ovwP94aa	It may be the quality of the shadow. Try Carbon by Mac which appears to be very popular. Revlon may have one.|`|F9mEoDGuaa	there are two undertones when a black eyeshadow/ liner/ watever is made:  blue and purple.     the blue based black is less intense and more likely to fade and turn into its base color.     purple based black is all around a deeper darker black and less likely to turn into its base color.     like another person who answered; "Carbon" from MAC is pretty great i can assume due to its high popularity.
5ZK9VGPCaa	Use tanning accelerator by the Lancaster range (orange bottles). Then use a tan maximiser afterwards. But don't go laying out without protecting your skin... you will age yourself, even if you are young, your skin will get damaged and you will get fine lines. I stick to fake tan except when I am on vacation.. But I wouldn't lay out the whole summer long, it's so bad and I see these old women who look like leather bags!!! eeeh.. also a light tan looks better.. Too tan is tacky.|`|BpD01lccaa	Spray on tan.

AA11955868	the word 'peel' just makes me cringe. I think they should call it, skin refresher or something. Someone in the marketing department got fired. Anyway.

Really I'd just pay someone to do it. But that's because I fear the peel.
Dh5CUjmkaa	I am assuming you mean off your fingers. You can get removers for them at any drug store or get a bottle of acetone. You can get it in the aisle with the nail polish remover. The stuff that is especially marked tip remover is acetone, but it has a brush in it that helps the nails come off easier.|`|NAJLZqHXaa	Your question doesn't really make sense....|`|2cheAoRqaa	soak them in alcohol/acetone or you can even go to the salon and pay them around five-eight dollars to take them off
XFtQnAxsaa	Right, im a hairdresser.. Tell your friend when she goes into the salon and they give her a consultation to firstly suggest that she wants nothing taken from the length! tell her to repeat herself and make sure the stylist is clear in what she is saying. But yes i reccomend her getting layers put in which will give it more boost, layers are very flattering but again if she is not getting any off the length i reccomend on her getting longer layers first then gradually if she is happy get them taken shorter.  And tell her NOT TO GET A PERM!!  if she has damaged cuticules they will be more visible! plus when getting a perm.. in my knowledge everyone regrets it as it tends to dry your hair out.|`|JHEeoyONaa	If she tells them not to, then they should listen to her, and not cut off the hair.

c9RY4BCfaa	Yes, growing out your hair is a good idea. Also, wear less makeup. It would be best wearing none. Slowly each week use less to the point where it isn't so noticed that you aren't wearing make-up anymore since people have gotten used to it. Also, try wearing clothes from stores other than abercrombie, american eagle, etc. (that is if you wear those)|`|el5xFmaqaa	Your eyes are soo pretty!!!

Maybe you can wear a neutral color eyeshadow or discontinue your use of eyeliner.  Just wear a little mascara and chapstick.  I also get a nice tan during the summer (but I also use spf 40+ for protection!!) and I always feel like I look better and don't have to wear as much makeup.|`|HvxKb4gIaa	i would say wear less makeup. just eyeliner and mascara on your top lid. and not too much. no sparkly eyeshadow or anything. but if you wanna be really natural, don't wear makeup at all.|`|tUYkerS9aa	Don't smoke or give up if you already do - it effects the skin.

The Clean and Clear Advantage system worked pretty well for me. It's pretty cheap, and it includes a face wash, moisturizer, and a spot treatment. You should be able to get this at a drugstore.    If you have super-sensitive skin, try using something natural. Look at companies like Burts Bees, Aveeno, and Kiss My Face. There are plenty to choose from, just pick a mild cleanser with nourishing vitamins.    If you don't have really sensitive skin, I would go with the Clean and Clear system.     Good luck, hope this helps!|`|1qUAdsXRaa	There is no cure for acne. But yes you can prevent it. Go to SkinID.com|`|tARYnBFcaa	Clean&Clear deep action cream cleanser...DONT GET PROACTIV!

H3PcFertaa	Here's a tattoo pain chart:  http://users.zoominternet.net/~rayvin/Do...|`|WLuEIwp5aa	Hurts a fair amount over those organs, trust me.  I usually find that color and shading isn't as bad as the linework because the needles are different and the tattoo machine is set differently.    However, some people think color work hurts more because it's often the last thing done if you get a tattoo done all in one sitting, and your skin is a lot more irritated by the end of it, and the adrenaline may be wearing off by then.  It's not because it's color, it's because of those two reasons.|`|f7l9byFGaa	It's more of an annoying sensation.  When I got my first tattoo it was on my ankle and at first it felt fine, then it became annoying and started to hurt.  It hurt when the tattoo guy kept going over the same areas over and over again.  I have heard that when the tattoo begins to fade people get it recolored and that hurts even worse.   Check out the links I have under sources.  The first one will tell you about tattoos and the 2nd one has a q&a which might be of interest to you.  Check them out.|`|uv0Y7Ar8aa	My hip, froin and my stomach did not hardly bother me at all. One of my least painful tattoos. Outlining is in my opinion the worst of getting a tattoo. Shading is nothing it almost has a numbing effect.    However,   Every person and there pain tollerance is different no person can give you an exact answer only there personal expierence or what they have heard. Siza makes a difference as well. The more fat you have the less painful, The more muscle it can be tender and if you have no fat its more tender|`|ua9zB4vTaa	I have one on my spine, and it basically felt like someone was pressing a little too hard with a pen.    No, it doesn't hurt more if it's coloured, the outline is the most painful part, so if you want to colour it in, go ahead.|`|vc3uRxQAaa	That's one of the most painful places to get one. I have several... and that was the only area that was really bad. The outline hurts the most. So I wouldn't suggest getting an all black tattoo there, unless you have a high tolerance for pain. Getting the color done isn't half as bad. I don't really know what to compare the pain to. You'll live though.|`|RI0z0McAaa	I mean how bad it hurts depends on your pain tolerance. I think the best way to describe it is being scratched over and over by a cat in the same spot. Its hot and it burns a bit, but nothing intolerable. Color is suposed to hurt more because the ink has to go deeper into the skin. I personallu thought the outlineing hurt worse. What are you getting?  Hope that helped!  P.S. Tattoos are really fun and really addictive!   Good Luck|`|wuRmrrfyaa	Just having had one done across my lower abdomen/waist five days ago, I can tell you it hurts like a sumbish. It's a very keen sort of pain, very sharp. The shading is nothing compared to the outline. Shading is pleasurable in comparison. Of course, the size of the tattoo needs to be taken into account. If it's not very big, you should be ok. If it is big (like mine....4 hours worth of being inked) I'd suggest having something good to eat first, and trying to relax as much as you can whilst it's being done.     As my inker told me, the stomach area is one of the most difficult to tattoo, but it's worth the pain if you really want the ink done. :)|`|EhQhbrMkaa	don't do it, it hurts like crazy.........i had one done on my penis and now i can't pee anymore|`|NBK3s2LVaa	They hurt but suck it up and don't be a wuss your not going to die from it and what doesn't kill you makes you stronger|`|rnqgiRkWaa	I HAVE 6. MY UPPER BACK MY SPINE, MY WHOLE SIDE, WRIST ETC!     MY UPPER BACK FELT LIKE A VERY BAD SUN BURN THAT KEPT GETTING RUBBED ON.   MY SPINE HURT THE MOST.     ITS BETTER WHEN YOUR WARM, RELAXED AND YOU CAN SEE THE TAT BEING MADE.     THEY SAY FOOT AND SPINE IS THE WORST.     IF THEY HAVE A HEAVY HAND YOU MIGHT BLEED A LOT AND IT FEELS LIKE A NEEDLE BEING DRAGGED UNDER YOUR SKIN. YOU GET NUMB TO IT AT SOME POINT THOUGH AND SOME PEOPLE FIND IT RELAXING AND A WAY TO RELEASE STRESS ANGER ETC.    MY HIP WAS THE LEAST PAINFUL

eyNtl0LEaa	I love Clean&Clear, it's the only thing I will use. The advantage products work wonderfully on me. I use the spot treatment when I first get a pimple and it zaps it away within a day. It lasts a while too, I've had my spot treatment for half a year and it still is almost full. The cleanser lasts 2-3 months. I wash my face in it every night. I use the Morning Burst in the morning and it brightens my skin. I use the Morning Glow moisturizer, it lasts for 6 months and I use it 2 times a day. I haven't bought the package, but I use some Advantage products and other products as well. I don't have very oily skin or a lot of acne, so what works on me may not work on you, and viceversa. But, as   I said before, I love Clean&Clear. I hope I have helped.|`|Z3bjHCZpaa	umm i have used this product. it has helped me a little bit. i had lots of acne on my forehead, right cheek and chin. For example i have had about 6 pimples on my chin now theres like 3 or 4. So it hasnt cleared it completely, but when I do stop using it, i break out really bad. This has lasted me umm a little more than a month.|`|zU8WEjoZaa	I've used the Clean and Clear Advantage system, and it worked quite well. The only thing I would be careful of is using it every single day. I used it everyday, and for the first week or so, it did a great job, but then the effects started wearing off and it stopped working. Use it every day for a week, and then use it every other day after that. In between days you use it, just get a mild and natural cleanser and moisturizer from a company like Burts Bees, Kiss My Face, or Aveeno.    If you use it every other day, I think the Clean and Clear system could probably last you for at least a month. Remember, a little goes a long way, so if you don't use a ton, then it should be able to sustain for a while.    Good luck, hope this helps!
UVj7VlKUaa	well your default is pretty dark so I dont know exactly how dark of brown your hair is, but by the pic it looks like a very pretty color. I definitely wouldn't dye it blonde if you have dark eyes. but maybe if you're aiming for a lighter color just get some few ashy brown  highlights but don't get them too gold looking, and if you're wanting to bring out your dark roots get some maroon highlights they look VERY good with dark brown or black hair.        ESTEFANiA!|`|AA11858204	ur natural hair is so pretty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|Xy4kHpteaa	Well to start off you have really beautiful hair and the natural colour looks great but if you're really set on dying it than there's a few things you could do. First, you have a rather pale complexion so it probably wouldn't be the best idea to go lighter, I would stay away from blond or any pale blues or greens. If you're interested in a more wild colour, I would do red. Don't dye your whole head but dye most of it. Just try to keep a little of the natural colour peaking though, a few strands hear and there. I have a friend who has a similar hair coulor, she did it and it came out great.    nd yes even if you dye your hair permanently it will eventually grow back out and your natural colour will return.|`|pOjY1ESZaa	Keep it that colour you face wouldn't suit any other colour and dying your hair wrecks it and makes it fall out if you keep doing it|`|pQoOwE3Vaa	if you love your natural hair color, why dye your hair?  but if you do dye your hair, even permanently, yes-it will grow back.  Your roots will grow back in because your hair doesnt grow from the tips, it grows from your roots. (havent you seen tons of girls with blonde hair everywhere except for their roots that are usually dark brown-they dyed their hair blonde but their natural color is brownish! it will take a while though.    ~BEST OF LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~
kdMM7OAaaa	omg here is one:   1   1. put your hair in a half pony tail.,  2. curl or straighten it.  3. wrap a peice of your hair thats in the pony tail part and pin it, or add a ribbon    okay this girl at school does it and it is so pretty.  1. wash your hair- only with conditioner because shampoos will dry your hair  2. when your hair is dry, take a section at least 2 inches wide and braid it loosley from the top by your part. do it on each side and in the back  3.then do big put not huge sections really tight all over and dont make it straight or in a line- make it un even  4. in the morning take it out and it will be really crimped and it is s pretty.    another option is to scrunch it and add a poof  1. wash your hair- optional it will add a wet look  2. take gel, mousse or whatever u have to style and grab a glob of it  3. rub it into your hair and take it from the bottom and push up  4. then it will be wavy- longer you push on it it will be wavierer    or you can add a poof and get a curler  1.take small section and curl all over your had then hairspray   as you unravel the curl    or my last one is  1. curl your hair  2. hairspray as you unravel each strand  3. put it in a side pony tail    or u can get it framed like this- i prefer styles than cuts:  http://www.myhaircuts.com/more/layered-h...  it says layer but it is not|`|BpNSm6sDaa	straighten your hair it makes almost everyones hair look cute|`|cR7DXFeLaa	u cn get braids which r always cute or straighten it or make it crinkly(wavy) or curly|`|1RAR0bEdaa	I had that problem to so i tried  - pulling my bags back on top of my head letting it poof.  -Getting a clip and pulling the hair in front of my bangs into the clip  Ang great news they worked for me and its not easy getting a 8th grade guy to notice you!|`|ocrnjukoaa	you're 12.....you dont need guys noticing you 0_0|`|RgAVm7zCaa	You aren't allowed to layer your hair?

K0Wq8xgJaa	OMG! I'm vegetarian too! Almost a year. Haha I'm getting there ;].  And yes cruelty free products MATTER alot to vegetarians.  Anyways, Cover Girl is NOT cruelty free as it's made by Proctor and Gamble or P&G. And P&G is not cruelty free =[    Neutrogena! Haha loved their foundation...until I found out it's NOT cruelty free! It's made by Johnson & Johnson. And JJ is not cruelty free.    Now lastly, Rimmel. Now that's a little tough. On Rimmel's website, it states that it does not test on animals. But read closely, it says, it does not test on the FINISHED product. And that is a tricky way of covering up the truth, and the truth is Rimmel TEST on animals.  When companies say, they don't test on animals, read CAREFULLY. If it says the FINISHED product, that doesn't mean they don't test on animals. They do. It's a tricky way of covering it up.    And just to help you out, a few drugstore brands that DON'T test on animals, are REVLON and ALMAY. =] Physicians Formula doesn't either. But PF is crap. Haha.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	I'm going to guess you mean she's vegan (stricter than vegetarian). Most companies if they are cruelty free will say so, or they'll say not tested on animals (same thing) since they know that many people will not buy the products otherwise.     If it doesn't say it, then it probably isn't.|`|ivPptkvfaa	I know Covergirl tests on animals, but I haven't checked out Neutrogena or Rimmel. Usually it will say that they don't test on animals on the bottle because that's something the company would be proud to display.

Qxk1V55Zaa	you need parental consent if you are under 18|`|CQJP3VPSaa	you have to be 18 and older to get it without consent|`|uOVepBl8aa	Come to Jamaica, we're clean and they pierce kids at any age (well if they look old enough to be 12 or 13 I guess) haha. Especially if your 16, thats like, way old enough to get it here :P    Sorry if this was an extremely unrealistic suggestion D: Good luck anyway hon.|`|lY82TsNBaa	most places you have to be 18.  i know how you feel, im not allowed to get anymore piercing either ):|`|AA11955868	Go with the belly button, the tongue can go all sorts of infectiously wrong and then if you survive it you'll play with it all the time, which just kind of makes you look mildly mentally handicapped.    Ohio is 18.     I'd just wait. It's much more fun to be whorey when you're older. Not that you're really whorey per say, but well. You were considering a tongue piercing *shrug* If the shoe is starting to fit...|`|AA10849332	18 with a valid id

2oN7WrVKaa	You cant tell if someone is too good for you by just pictures my friend.  Personality is the key to any connection.  She just isn't feeling you like that Im assuming.  Give it time.  Be her friend.  And maybe sometime in the future she will change her mind.|`|iMULlxdgaa	ahhhhhh..you guys look like your sister and brother...are you sure she isn't your sister?|`|JCBmMtqZaa	darling your lovely. u look like a sweet and humble guy but because she wants to be just friends doesn't mean she to good for you, it could be you're to good for her, maybe not looks wise (not saying your ugly, i actually think you're pretty attractive) but maybe personality wise. you may just not be her type but don't give up. there are plenty of girls out there. i think you do have a chance. maybe not with her, but definitely with females. good luck:)|`|eDP3YU5Laa	kinda|`|J758mw2Naa	Uhhh no...    Your both pretty much the same looks wise...    She might be more outgoing if that's what you mean, but no I could see you guys together.    **although I always disagree with ANY KIND of interracial relations**|`|1IIY1Ds6aa	don't listen to these a*holes    race is not the problem    you two would be adorable together    but if she just wants to remain friends, then do just that    maintain your friendship with this girl...who knows, it could blossom into something wonderful |`|ncPdftafaa	yall are the same..looks wise.    DONT LISTEN TO ROXI SHE's ALWAYS OWN HERE ASKING IF SHE'S PRETTY. SHE NEEDS TO SHAVE HER BACK. WHAT RACE ARE YOU, ROXI? SASQUATCH? seriously people if you gonna post pics up don't show your hairy *** back. that girl got a dead musk rat on her back. AND she got a unibrow how unattractive.|`|9qb8DCHbaa	umm.  looks wise, i'd say she's a little out of your league.    but if she likes your personality, then mabye.|`|ju8CjD84aa	If she wants to be friends.. forget her|`|L4RAKdbSaa	you two would make a strange but nice couple. i say go for it :D|`|oXKLf3hMaa	no one is "too good" for anyone else. and if you're asking if there's some huge discrepancy in your appearances, there isn't. she's not saying she thinks she's better than you, she just wants to be friends (at least for now). you might have a chance if she starts liking you in a romantic kind of way, but don't live on hope for that because if it doesn't happen you'll be "living a lie"|`|BopBYwSdaa	YOU look good (please shave the goat mustache on the chin...you will look even better    HER... her second photo look cute! Her first photo, she look so average or below average...do you have better photo of her?    Give her sometime... maybe need time to make love grow, hard to just ask for it like "if you like me"    good luck and be patient with love|`|cxVmq2kraa	Nononono, you'd be cute :)      Help?  http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|UAWiu1hUaa	no deff not  i ment shes not too good for you  go for it~|`|S3tVSDfaaa	she definately not too good for you look wise.  it could be something else. but as far as looks your not even ugly.|`|tzMMFPr4aa	no she just wants to be firend with you, nothing romantic.|`|NAJLZqHXaa	u seem good enough for each other... :\|`|ongRwyvwaa	u guys dont make a good couple,u look from egypt and she from china|`|c63d23a0d58654baa299d30bffb007bbaa	No one is to good for someone else just based on looks!  If she says she just wants to be friends, all she means is that she wants to be friends, not that you're ugly or something (you're not, by the way)|`|17w5Sqaaaa	u should go for it, I dont think that shes too good for u.  You are really handsome.  Just be nice to her and be a gentleman and she will start to come on.  And dont aske her if she likes you a lot.|`|e22c69d9c930e30e0d8bcfc48f81dd6faa	It means exactly what she said. She just wants to be friends.    Maybe she fancies someone else.  Maybe she just doesn't fancy you.  Maybe she thinks she's too good for you.    Whatever the reason, it doesn't matter. She's told you, after you asked her if she liked you, that she just wants to be friends.    That's it. You can't find anyway of working around that.    Sorry for being so harsh about it, but you'll just embarass yourself in front of her if you carry on.|`|GHwsazvyaa	no she's not outta ur leauge u guys would be cute. just get to know her better n dont let her c that it bothers u that she wants to remain friends......................maybe shes playing hard to get, just show her how funn n smart you are!|`|8neAGg9eaa	If you need to ask if someone is too good for you based on looks then you should seriously consider seeking some couseling. That is very shallow in my opinion.|`|cweT8Phpaa	O sweet, I think try be friends and then one day she will like you. Just be an opportunist. Good luck and I Luvs your eyes!

(you may want to think about growing your hair)|`|DskzIKhnaa	gel the bangs up with maximun strength gel, then bobbby pin it.    as long as your front hair is out of your face, you should be fine.|`|RKV7xd3Naa	instead of changing it embrace it keep some peices in the front out and put it in a high pony tail. get the peices out of your face with clips NOT bobby pins bobby pins wont hold during badminton game.|`|AA10517735	-"poof" in the middle of your head---brush all your hair back, then put two fingers on your head (about 3 inches apart) and "pinch" the hair so you have a little bump. use bobby pins(in an X), or a barrette, or a little clip (the ones that have intertwining "claws")  -headband + hair gel/spray or bobby pins  -two or more thin stretchy headbands  -one thicker headband with "grips" that hold hair in place
