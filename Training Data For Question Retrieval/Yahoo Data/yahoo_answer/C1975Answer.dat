AA11113442	There is absolutely no chance that vinyl will make a comeback in the mass market.  Other formats such as cd and mp3 offer quality, portability and durability that vinyl records just cannot offer.  But that isn't to say that vinyl isn't making a comeback, because it is.  Digital formats lack the warm lush sound that only a vinyl record can provide, and that is one of the reasons so many serious music fans are collecting lps once again.  Also the album artwork is displayed more prominently in a way that is easily framed by those that wish to show off their collection.   The final reason vinyl is making a comeback is undoubtably the "cool" factor.  Listening to vinyl has always been considered retro and hip, and many bands try to establish their credibility by offering it as a format choice.|`|8307a3850bda3652d084fe40988e7e27aa	99.9% it wont happen,and if it does 8 tracks and reel to reel with follow.|`|1308f99137c327e3c35b55fc6b3fbfa0aa	No, I don't think they will. Many people colllect and it is a cool hobbie but were in the 21st Cetury and there is no way that people are going to want to go back. But if you have a lot, consider burning them into CDs and then downloading on to a computer and then on to a MP3. I am sorry if you thought that would be true... but NO CHANCE!|`|3f9c5ab18d06c75e34b2660a6b6605b7aa	It all depends on the market segment you're talking about.

I also don't think they will actually replace anything, it will be more of an "optional" type of thing. Every week there's another article in the press about vinyl making a comeback - a lot of that has to do with the DJ / clubbing / mixing scene - but there's also a growing number of young people discovering the format - vinyl is a big thing particularly with collectors, who want to own everything associated with their favorite band (and if that catalog included vinyl, they've gotta have that too).<br>  <br>  Vinyl can also be a very lucrative investment if you know what to look out for and what to horde. Anyone who says otherwise doesn't know what they're taking about.... It's becoming a specialist market, not for everyone but neither are antiques....

Foi descoberto por J?ns Jacob Berzelius, em 1823. O silício é o segundo elemento mais abundante da face da terra, perfazendo 25.7% do seu peso. Aparece na argila, feldspato, granito, quartzo e areia, normalmente na forma de dióxido de silício (também conhecido como sílica) e silicatos (compostos contendo silício, oxigênio e metais). O silício é o principal componente do vidro, cimento, ceramica, da maioria dos componentes semicondutores e dos silicones, que s?o substancias plásticas muitas vezes confundidas com o silício.<br>  <br>  Pertence ao grupo 14 ( 4A ) da Classifica??o Periódica dos Elementos.

e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	Technology in itself is neither good or bad.  It uses it can be put to can be considered good or bad, but not the technology itself.  Everything is this way.  A baseball bat can be used to play a game or bean somebody over the head.  It's the use that makes the difference.  A car can be use to take somebody to a hospital or take a criminal to a store to rob it.  Technology can be used to pollute the environment or to clean it up.  Cloning could be used to grow a new organ for a person with a failing kidney or perhaps enable the perfect crime.  A cloned steak may cause illness or other issues or it may provide tasty, nutritious food and prevent the abuse of thousands of animals and the depletion of resources.|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	Generally it is fine.

BpY2ed0Gaa	To figure out how long to charge a battery for:    (battery capacity (battery's mAh rating)/charger output (mA - usually written on the charger)) x 1.4(for NiCad batteries, 1.5 for NiMh batteries) = time (in hours).    For example:    I have an 1100 mAh battery and a charger which outputs at 180mA. It's a NiMh battery so you multiply by 1.5.    (1100/180) x 1.5 = 9.146666 hours    Note that the result in decimal, so 9.16 hours is NOT 9 hours and 16 mins! 0.16 of an hour is approximately one sixth of an hour or ten mins.      Other things to note: The multiplier of 1.4 or 1.5 is to account for the resistance in the cells as you're charging, If you don't use it then you won't get a full charge.  Often online stores will tell you to change a battery for only a few hours. This is almost always wrong (they can't possibly know what combination of batteries and chargers you've got) they're covering their asses to prevent you from overcharging your battery on their advice and trying to claim for a new one...

RagyfEoXaa	Its good to use Auto so the camera decides if you need the flash.  If you want to get close to something, don't use the zoom because it makes it a little blurry and it doesn't look as nice compared to when you physically go up to it yourself.  Go on different angles so the picture looks cooler. Go on your stomach, in the air (if you can find a way), diagonally, to get your shot.  Also keep your eyes open, and look for things people don't really notice, then take a picture of that.  If you want to focus on one specific thing, put your camera on "portrait" and go close to the object (or zoom if needed), and take your picture.   Try to see where the light hits things, and see what affect that has on the picture.  When you are shooting more than one picture, take all of the pictures, then check and delete all the ones you don't want on the computer when you upload them.If you shoot, then check, shoot, then check a million times, your battery will run out quicker.  Remember that a photographer can take hundreds of pictures, but only love one in the end. Hope this helps! Good luck!

Now, it really depends on your favorite genre and all, but Skate 2 is actually pretty revolutionary for it's realism. I don't know if you like that, but it seems pretty awesome to me.    Battlefield: Bad Company. The single-player probably isn't that excellent, but I must admit, I've tried the online multiplayer, and that is ridiculously awesome. BBC is a must have for the Xbox 360 if you're into these sorts of games.    Call of Duty: World at War, this game seems like a complete redo of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. If there was a WW2 version of CoD4, then this would be it. It's still a fun game, but not nearly as impressive as you may think it will be.    Gears of War 2. This is also a must-have for the Xbox 360. It is freakin' awesome in both modes, single and multiplayer, and the co-op functions only make everything better. If you have a friend to play it with, you must buy this game.    If you don't already have The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, this is a must-have for the Xbox 360 as well. It is primarily single-player, but it completely shows off Bethesda's gaming talent. Great voice actors, great gameplay, excellent plot. Very easy to follow as well.    Mass Effect, if you don't have this either, this is another must-have game for the Xbox 360. This is a sci-fi based roleplaying game that, is once again, ridiculously awesome. Even if you think you may dislike it, you should at least give the demo a try or maybe even just rent it. The game is awesome. Perfect single-player.    Sorry if I couldn't help more.

Once that 2 years is up you're on your own. Keep in mind as well that a lot of your music (if you have other files) cannot be uploaded onto Itunes, because it only allows certain songs. I'm sure you can find another MP3 player at a local Best Buy/Circuit City, and possibly for cheaper. Make sure you do your research before you buy anything.

Sometimes you cannot adjust because older recordings are recorded on different formats so the sound is lower.
JCryYmC3aa	I like records, something about the old popping sound, however all formats have there quarks and benefits, Ex: CDs Work great but are fragile and dont give out all types of sounds, Cassettes can give out those sounds but you cant skip with them, 8 Track can skip but poor sound quality. Either way they are all fun to fiddle with.

2fcd641c710fe3a24f1d8209f037f864aa	As far as i know, there is no way to convert an Audio Cassette into a CD directly. I recommend that you should use a well-known software, Gold Wave to change an Audio Cassette for a digital form like wav file type or mp3. For this process, you need a line cable to link the mic output of a tape recorder to the sound input hole of  a computer. Then you should have your computer ready to record an Audio Cassette by clicking a recording function in the program to arrange the recording time. After that, play the cassette while you need to push the recording button in red.

You can qualify for a $.15 cent an hour raise after the first 6 months, and $.25 after the first year, and every after that, possibly slightly more, depending on your performance. Since you're the host of the store, an agent from Sprint will be closely evaluating the performance of your store, and you personally as well.<br>  <br>  Also, if you want to keep a phone inventory at your store (as opposed to having to order each phone from a Sprint distribution center every time a customer buys one from you), you'll have to pay a $10,000 security deposit to Sprint upon opening the store, and you won't get your first paycheck until 3 months after you sell your first contract, and then after that 3 months, you'll have to wait 6 months after each contract before your store is paid for it. You will also will get a $25 deduction from your personal paycheck for every contract that cancels in the first 6 months.
AA10200229	Good question! I've just cancelled my Nextel contract and would like to know that as well! As far as Nextel "partners," go, I think Sprint would be considered Nextel's only partner of sorts. Nextel isn't affiliated with T-Mobile, Cingular, Alltell, or Verizon, or any of the other big national companies, so I know none of them would be considered Nextel's partner! I switched to Verizon, and they are in no way partners with Nextel!<br>  <br>  Maybe if you switched from Nextel to Sprint service, then you might not have to pay the fee, since it's all in the same company, but I can't imagine they'd let you out of paying the fee for switching to any other company!<br>  <br>  If you find a way to get out paying the fee, please let me know. I can also come back and let you know if I find anything! My email is utah.dustin@yahoo.com.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

If you take it to a video game store to sell it or trade it in, they will give you hardly anything for it.|`|58590cdc21e4541a62100dbdd08d9975aa	No. You can only swap out your Xbox for the same model if yours breaks and never works again.

For that we get probably close to 100 channels of standard TV, 35 or so HD channels, plus a movie channel, an HD DVR, and On Demand movies and services, most of which is included in the price.

I was getting local stations (ABC, CBS, NBC) in HD, a HD-DVR for $29/month.    I got zero cable channels -but most of our favorite shows are on the major networks.

If the tv has dvi then you would purchase a dvi to dvi cable. if the tv doesn't accept dvi, but accepts hdmi you can purchase a dvi to hdmi cable (that's what I use on my 52" sony wega) which will connect very nicely to your tv. <br>  <br>  The cables are easily purchased at a big box store for many dollars, OR you can go to monoprice, newegg and many others for the same cable at about 1/4 the price.|`|AA10594501	Sure you could use your TV as a computer monitor, but remember that it only has a resolution of 1366x768, not much for a screen that size.|`|akvrwpywaa	Yeah, Mac uses DVI out.

zSjBHNSFaa	There are some great websites that allow you to trade books, CD's, DVD's etc. See my profile for link to titletrader, SwapaDVD and paperbackswap. This allows you to get rid of an item you no longer want and get something you do want in return. Titletrader is awesome because you can trade books, dvd's, cd's, games and vhs tapes. So if you get rid of a book you may be able to get a dvd in exchange. Paperbackswap is only for books. SwapaDVD is only for DVDs. All three sites are great!

First, you will need an audio file or song in .mp3 format. You can email me if you need an .mp3 file for a specific song. Upload that song into Ventones. Once it is done loading, you will get to choose a 30 second segment from the song to be your ringtone. To make it sound more realistically like a ringtone, I would suggest choosing the one second fade at the end.<br>  <br>  Next, once the 30 second ringtone is done uploading, you will be given the options to either download the file to your computer, enter your phone number and have it sent in a text, or generate the download URL and enter it in your phone's web browser. (I would choose the last option to enter it into your phone's browser.)<br>  <br>  Once it is in your browser, it might get slow, just because the download files are setting up and all that stuff. It will automatically download (it's a very small file) in about a second or two. To find the file, go to your "My Music" section (name will vary based on carriers; just play with it a little) and set the song as RINGTONE. <br>  <br>  Congratulations, your song is a ringtone =)<br>  <br>  (Note: I'm not sure if you have to pay to download it because you're using the Internet. I don't think I had to pay)<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!

UAYzLyN4aa	cathode ray tube, also known as a CRT.<br>  <br>  edit: The glass isn't "coated with lead," it is "lead glass" - the lead is included in the glass itself. The front of the CRT is heavy because the layer of glass there is very thick. One reason, yes, is to suppress X-rays that would otherwise be a problem. (High-velocity electrons slamming into the metal aperture grill or shadow mask do produce X-rays.) <br>  <br>  The other reason is that the very high vacuum in the tube requires a very strong tube. 14.7 psi over the area of the tube is a lot of force to resist! (295 square inches in old "25 inch" CRTs... that is a total of over 4300 pounds!) To make the large, flat face of the tube strong enough simply requires thick glass.|`|akvrwpywaa	Cathode ray tube (CRT).<br>  Basically an electron gun that fires electrons at phosphors on the back of the screen.  These phosphors give off a very brief (hence fast response time) particular colored glow when excited by electrons, which produces light in that particular area (subpixel).  The glass screen is coated with lead to ensure that no radiation can get by; this is the main reason why CRT televisions tend to be heavier than LCD's or plasmas.  This is all inside a vacuum to ensure precision of image quality, since air particles could bend the beam of electrons slightly.|`|yR12yAjraa	There are many difference with parts of LCD,PLASMA with CRT.But the basic difference is the picture tube also called Cathode Ray Tube.It increase the size of the TV.It contain an deflecting system which needs space.But LCD"s TVs made of micro processor and Liquid Crystal Display,which have extremely thin in size..

You start off very low, but as you play and earn exp points, you can upgrade them. 100 points, equals one point upgrade.    If you have an EA Sports Bio, or something like that, the longer you play, the more bonuses you unlock, like 3 extra dynasty points, so when you start a dynasty, you are ahead of the other teams.    Since my staff facilities are above average, whenever I get a player, his overall is increased.

c84e3d7c6c8ecfe924819637cbf13e07aa	I had the same problem. What is happening is that your Nunchuck is coming loose, and then re-connecting itself really quickly, which is resetting the default position. Just like if you hold down the stick on the nunchuck while your plugging it in, it will think that holding it in that direction is centred. you have to just unplug the nunchuck and then plug it back in.

It may be possible it could be the sensor bar..  It never hurts to have a spare controller around. c:|`|9M8lEQDqaa	It's probably the controller. On the Wii Menu you just have to point but in the game you actually have to press buttons. Are you using the Wii nunchuck or classic controller? If so then just unplug the attachment, blow on it a little if you want, and plug it back into the Wii mote.     If you're just using the Wiimote by itself to play the game make sure that the buttons are not sticking.    Also try this:     Hold the Wii Remote with the button side down. Without using much force, firmly tap the button side of the remote against the palm of your other hand a few times.    If its still not working:  Check to make sure the Sensor Bar cord is inserted into the back of the Wii console and the Sensor Bar is centered above or below your TV screen (more info).     Make sure you are using fresh batteries in the Wii Remote.     The Wii Remote Controller should be used between 3 to 10 feet from the TV.     Make sure no objects are blocking the signals between the Sensor Bar, the Wii console, and the Wii Remote.     Check for interference from infra-red light sources, such as candles, sunlight, fireplaces, and stoves.     Radio frequency interference may cause the Wii Remote to work erratically. Check for wireless devices such as cordless phones, wireless computer keyboards or mice, or other similar devices, and move or turn them off.|`|nnZDsSBFaa	This is most likely because of your nunchuck. While the game is loading, do you move the control stick on the nunchuck? If so, that position will be considered the "default" position and the game will read the nunchuck not being moved at all is actually a moved position. To fix this, either do not move the nunchuck while the game is loading or after the game has loaded, take out the nunchuck and then replug it.

hJP9y6kjaa	Yes, it's safe.<br>  <br>  When in doubt, plug into a higher impedance, and you're safe... when you can't match, that is.<br>  <br>  So ideally 6 ohm should go to 6 ohm... that means 100% of the power is transmitted. If 6 ohms goes into a higher number ohms, less than 100% of the power will be transmitted. If 6 ohms goes into a *lower* number, then the amp will try and deliver more than its rated wattage, and you'll damage something.<br>  <br>  You may or may not notice a drop in volume - since the other speakers are higher quality, they may have a higher sensitivity, which is one of the important factors in overall volume.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul

VMVW3E7Aaa	I'm not really qualified to answer this, so take it with a grain of salt, but I'm under the impression that those instant polaroids (and the film that is needed to go with it) are a dying breed.

Now just open the Nexus Radio software and click the "On-Demand" tab. Enter the name of the artist/song in the search box and click search.

dC7d5sy5aa	This may help with your decision.<br>  <br>  The following is a list from best to worst including their resolution capabilities for transport:<br>  <br>  HDMI (1080p, 1080i, 720p, 480p, 480i)<br>  Component (1080i, 720p, 480p, 480i)<br>  S-Video (480i)<br>  Composite (480i)<br>  Coaxial (480i)<br>  <br>  As you can see HDMI and component support 1080. It is pretty hard to tell the difference between p and i. <br>  Ultimately you should update your box to one with an HDMI output as this is now the connection of choice within the consumer electronic industry. This will give you a degree of future proofing.<br>  If you cant use HDMI (which carries both video and audio) use the component for video and either optical (toslink) or digital co-ax (this will be colored orange) for the audio.<br>  This set up will give you a great picture and 5.1/7.1 digital sound.|`|ndQkhqZeaa	Why do you want to use HDMI cables?<br>  If your TV is not HD, it is not going to change anything.<br>  <br>  The signal difference between coax, RGB and HDMI is slim to none with out an HD TV.<br>  <br>  If it is an HD TV, you need to trade in your DVR for an HD/DVR combo box.

8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Most home theaters in a box (HTIB) are player-based, meaning they have the amp in a DVD player to which the surround sound speakers are attached.  Since you already have one of the best Blu-ray/DVD players made you should not buy such a system.  Instead you should buy an HTIB that is receiver-based, meaning it's an actual receiver that you can plug all sorts of things into.  In my opinion the best receiver-based HTIBs are made by Onkyo.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.us.onkyo.com/prod_class.cfm?class=Systems" rel="nofollow">http://www.us.onkyo.com/prod_class.cfm?c...</a><br>  <br>  I know HT-S6100 is 7.1 and up can handle the HD audio (multi-channel PCM).  The HT-S5100 and below may just convert everything to lossy audio.  Amazon has the HT-S6100 for $611.<br>  <br>  You could also buy a receiver (i.e. Onkyo TX-SR606 7.1, $418) and a set of surround sound speakers (i.e. Polk RM6750 5.1, $250).<br>  <br>  As far as the the 1,000 watt requirement goes I'd have to ask why you want that much.  That's fine for blasting CD audio out of two tower speakers, but what you're looking at here is a set of 6-8 small speakers.  Unless you live under a train track you don't need 1,000 watts for watching movies.  Besides, most spec sheets that list wattage aren't accurate.<br>  <br>  Forget Best Buy.  That place is a ripoff.  So is anything made by Monster or Bose.  But it online.|`|AA11056614	If you really want an HTIB have a look at the lists at the links.<br>  <br>  You will sacrifice some flexibility and performance vs a component system, but at that price range an HTIB is probably a reasonable choice.|`|wQFZKkWHaa	Samsung announced several HTiB systems at CES, and the one referenced below might fit your needs, though it will be more than $800 for sure, thanks to the Blu-ray player. I'd question the need for a specific wattage output level though. As stated, room size is important, a system that's "too big" won't sound good in your space. <br>  <br>  Onkyo has some very well respected systems, though they don't include a DVD player, not sure if that's important to you. BB is not a reseller of Onkyo, that's why you don't see them there.|`|bRJAqc8Baa	Home theater system is based on watts and speaker watts.  If you buy a 1000 watt system but 30 watt speakers you have done yourself a disservice.  <br>  <br>  Here is a good guide: <br>  <br>  Take a 15 x 15.  You want to have 5 speakers that have 100 watt capability, plus the sub.  This will give you optimal sound for that room.  You will only use about 50% of the max volume anyway.<br>  <br>  Find a system that fits these guidelines and you have a good system for your living area.|`|xGzq2Eueaa	Well a good brand is yamaha or das. these are awesome for 5.1 with the xbox 360 and movies

7ec425050e76a22d0ee41a6e47a3060daa	Hi, to say the truth, i wouldn't recommend the nokia 5800. I've been using this phone for 2 months already and i'm far from happy. It may seem cool and full of features, but the ones working are really useless. There are many negatives: First of all it is a very "crude" phone, when you hold it in your hand it always creaks. Also it is very fragile, i dropped it only once and now it always turns off if you press a little bit on it. Also it doesn't have a 3d accelerator, this causes many programs  to slow down, like GPS will run very slow, and it will be impossible to play games, the 3d ones. Also the menu is kinda ugly, and the touch screen isn't very accurate,  if you have to click on a small link, while using the internet, it will be very hard to do it. Also, the phone has a 3.2 megapixel camera, but the pictures it makes look as if the camera only has 0,3 megapixels, the photos are awful, and so are the videos. <br>  Basically the only good things about this phone is the battery, the phone lives long, and the speakers, they are really loud.<br>  I would recommend you to buy a used iphone. It is much better. It may not have as many programs on it, when you but it as the nokia 5800 may, but what's great about it is that you can install all them. I used Iphone for 6 months before the Nokia 5800 and i still regret buying the nokia phone.|`|rWZbtgXIaa	For the budget you have specified there is a very wide range of models available in the market.

So it is always better to go for candy bar ones, and here are some of the candy bar phones in that range.<br>  <br>  Nokia 6220 C : <a href="http://www.indiareviewchannel.com/products/1443-Nokia-classic.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.indiareviewchannel.com/produc...</a><br>  <br>  Nokia N78: <a href="http://www.indiareviewchannel.com/products/1396-NOKIA-N.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.indiareviewchannel.com/produc...</a><br>  <br>  Motorola Zn5: <a href="http://www.indiareviewchannel.com/products/ProductDetails.aspx?ProductId=10290" rel="nofollow">http://www.indiareviewchannel.com/produc...</a><br>  <br>  Motorola Q9: <a href="http://www.indiareviewchannel.com/products/10747-Motorola-Q-h-G.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.indiareviewchannel.com/produc...</a><br>  <br>  Sony Erricson C902: <a href="http://www.indiareviewchannel.com/products/1698-Sony-Ericsson-C.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.indiareviewchannel.com/produc...</a><br>  <br>  Sony P1i: <a href="http://www.indiareviewchannel.com/products/ProductDetails.aspx?ProductId=11388" rel="nofollow">http://www.indiareviewchannel.com/produc...</a>|`|hR4Dfa4Taa	I have it. i lov it.|`|aqR9EQw3aa	First of all it may cost u a couple of grands more <br>  its retailing around 20 K but see if u can get discount<br>  <br>  well i will provide u with a link in tht u can find more abt the phone<br>  reviews and all<br>  and in comment section read the comments too<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.congeries.unwireindia.com/200..." rel="nofollow">http://www.congeries.unwireindia.com/200...</a><br>  <br>  hope it helps u|`|8rmmlKCwaa	I m using it.

XVMxuADtaa	It will vary from machine to machine but videohelp.com is a good place to start your search for machine specific hacks|`|hNCiw6Laaa	See my recent Q on this...|`|u3wsFlfwaa	Your best bet is to just google it. Make sure you put the make and model number in. Most can be hacked to make them multi-region. i have found though that the cheaper the DVD player, the easier they are to hack. If you put it in google, it will come up with the code that you need to type in. <br>  Good luck|`|9OX3sTDnaa	Not every DVD player can be hacked. It might be worth googling your make and model number and also inserting 'region free hack'. If it can be done it usually involves either holding buttons on the player while you turn it on or pressing certain buttons on your remote control.|`|Vzzc6mATaa	Have a look at <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2000/dot_life/2197548.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/sci_...</a>|`|oLz4jYXqaa	You will have to supply more details - make, model.

In either case you need a usb 2.0 port on your computer which is pretty standard these days.  But for it to work properly in Windows you need to install the ITunes Software.

5TruLh9Eaa	1. SONY EX 55- Sony’s silicone tips fit in your ear canals and seal out considerably more noise than the open-speaker Apple designs and similar earbuds. Unfortunately, what’s piped into your ears is a step down from the sound you get for free in Apple’s box. EX55 presents music with Sony’s characteristic modest bass bias, but without the clarity and corresponding treble or midrange detail we expect these days from good, similarly-priced earbuds. By comparison with even the iPod’s pack-ins, the EX55 sounds downright flat, with less treble, clarity, and a more bloated bass thump. No matter which song we tested, Apple’s presentation of audio was bigger, clearer and better balanced—instruments comparatively “popped.” <br>  <br>  2. Bose In ear Headphones-The Bose TriPort In-Ear headphones have strong bass and good overall detail, and they're not intrusive in your ear canal. These headphones don't block out any noise, and the fit doesn't feel quite as secure as advertised. The silicone tips come off very easily, and pick up tons of dirt.<br>  <br>  3. Shure E2C-To get any bass out of the E2c, you need to push the earpieces pretty far into your ear canals. Since human ears vary in size, Shure provides small, medium, and large pairs of disposable foam sleeves and reusable flex sleeves to ensure the best possible fit.While the deep-mounted earpieces may take some getting used to, the E2c sounds great. And since it's sold with a 30-day money-back guarantee, you can audition its comfort and audio quality for yourself risk-free.<br>  <br>  All three are excellent set of earphones. If money is no concern then I would suggest you to go for bose.  They provide heavy bass and combine seamlessly with your Ipod|`|mEbYPVpvaa	Sony ex 55|`|771a432239749c75069cce288603b99eaa	For me the best that ive ever had where the ones that came with my sony erriccson fone. i cant remember the model number but they where brill. Hope this helps|`|g1BdxF74aa	Headphones for me are a necessity of life. When I'm at home I have my Sennheisser HDR130 wireless, but these do not port easily. So, when I go out walking, jogging, or just relaxing at the beach, I have a pair of lightweight headphones that I use with my MP3 player. Of all the various types of portable headphones and earphones available, what I love most is the canalphone, or in-ear phone. These have always provided me with the greatest sound and eliminated any distractions. The canalphone will give you clear, full range audio while blocking outside noises. This is both and bad. Doctors have never recommended it and safety experts say that some slight availability to outside noises can prevent accidents. Personally, I don't care and neither do millions of others. Here are five of the top canalphones on the market.<br>  <br>  Philips SHS8000<br>  I list these first because this is the set that I own and love. The SHS8000 offers great sound and no distortion. The best feature about these phones is the rubber, low profile ear hooks attached. I don't know about you, but I have small ears and ear canals that are simply not made for holding things in place. With the ear hook, I don't have to worry about the phones popping out and swinging around by the wire. If and when they work themselves out, They are still right there at my ear. This set sells for $29.99 and can be bought at your local Target or online from www.amazon.com.<br>  <br>  Shure E2c<br>  In the past couple years, Shure has made a tremendous impact in the headphone industry by offering ultra premium quality and ultra premium prices. But not every Shure product has that high price tag. The E2c Sound Isolating Earphones are a great example of quality design at reasonable prices. They run for $59.99 and comes with a variety of sleeves that fit into the ear for any size or softness.

Q98ICmXlaa	Your red, blue, and green cables are called "component" cables. They are used to carry video signals<br>  <br>  Your red and white cables are called "composite cables" They are used to carry audio signals, generally <br>  <br>  Just to clarify, composite cables are not the only ways to carry audio. Coaxial and fiber optic cables can do it as well<br>  <br>  Are you getting sound with your system? If so then how are you connecting it? And, if you already have sound then you will not need the composite cable.<br>  <br>  Once you get your HDMI cable you will no longer need your red/blue/green cables, but you may now need your red/white cables depending whether or not your TV can accept sound via HDMI. Check your manual for this information or if you can't find it then just give it a try when it comes in. You will have to change some options on the menu. If however, it does not work, then you just simply connect the red/white wires or use your current method (coax or fiber opt.) You won't notice a huge difference in sound quality unless you are an audiophile with expensive speakers|`|Ai4kGM1Oaa	Yes, the red and white cables are stereo audio cables, they'll generate the same quality sound as your DVD player did before, but unless you have a Home Theater system, it shouldn't matter.<br>  <br>  The Red Blue Green are Video, the Red white are audio, without them you won't have sound|`|dC7d5sy5aa	Once you get your HDMI cables you will not need to keep the other red and whit cables connected.<br>  HDMI carries both video and audio (as well as a lot of other stuff. There are 19 wires in an HDMI cable that carry all sorts of data.) You will probably need to go into the set up software of both your TV and your set top box and tell the devices that you are using the HDMI ports.<br>  <br>  Good luck you should enjoy.

KNN4a8uYaa	Yeah - as above, I've heard it refered to as Child Perspective.  Lower to the ground angled up.  That combined with holding the camera vertically gives a fairly imposing viewpoint.  <br>  <br>  Peer perspective is pretty much dead on - face to face level.<br>  <br>  Parent is from above angled down.<br>  <br>  Oh, another tip - try to fill the frame with your subject - again that would make the subject seem or feel larger than life.|`|v7Wflu78aa	Please note: Akimbo = hands on hips, which is what the previous poster referred to.<br>  <br>  A powerful person is, figuratively and literally at the top of a pyramid.
