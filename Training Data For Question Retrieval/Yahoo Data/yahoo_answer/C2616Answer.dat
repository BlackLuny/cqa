They were beautiful and were so economic.  He was a supervisor so did not belong to the union.  They went out on strike and demanded much higher wages and more benefits.  After a month of negotiations the company finally hired other people and went on producing - then the union hired 'strikebreakers' to come up and scare the people who were now working away.  They even beat a couple of them up.  The company opened their books and showed the union negotiators why they could not do what the union wanted - because they could not afford it!  They ended up closing the doors and going out of business.  The union would not relent.  A family business for 3 generations shut down by the union.

70j0Bmzdaa	brake lock removal in 45 seconds  steering lock less than 30 seconds these are a waste of money and will only put off/ delay the most amature of car thieves best bet get an engine kill switch fitted but disguise the switch by having it fitted to the dash board with all the other switches but don't use a switch that would look out off place ie.the word kill on it try something like an air-con switch.<br>  if you want better security just get it fitted with an immobiliser|`|i5lk5eN2aa	The type of kill switch I would highly recommend is the Mobilistics RF code encrypted remote controlled relay switch, which is marketed as the Vandal Alert "No-Start" relay. The No-Start relays are totally passive and arms automatically 30 seconds after you shut the ignition switch off and disarms when you get within it's radio range (10 feet) and press button #1 on it's key chain remote control. But I do not recommend you install it as it is intended, which is to replace the vehicle starter relay or ignition relay. Car thieves are wise to this device if they see it in the fuse box and they will simply unplug it and replace it will a standard factory relay. Your vehicle will be very secure with the No-Start relay though if you hardwire it yourself and hide the relay.<br>  <br>  There are a variety of No-Start relays with a variety of relay footprints to fit a variety of vehicles. But if you hardwire one yourself and hide the relay as I suggest you will want to buy the "GRI-B" Bosch type with the 4-prong footprint and also a matching 4-wire pigtail connector socket. It will be easy to hardwire that on 'any' year, make, and model 12-volt system vehicle. Connect the red wire on the 4-wire pigtail relay connector to any accessory power source which is ONLY hot when the ignition switch is in the ON position and connect the white wire on the 4-wire pigtail relay connector to a good ground. The green and black wires on the 4-wire pigtail relay connector is what you will use to kill the circuit of your choice. If you want to kill the starter then cut the wire to the neutral safety switch and connect the green wire to one cut end and the black wire to the other cut end. Likewise, if you want to kill the fuel pump, cut the wire to the fuel pump and connect the green wire to one cut end and the black wire to the other cut end. Then plug the remote controlled No-Start relay in to the pigtail connector socket when you finish wiring. Turn the ignition switch to the ON position and then press button #1 on it's key chain remote control before attempting to START the vehicle. That will disarm it and energize the circuit you killed. It will arm again automatically and disable the circuit you killed within 30 seconds after you shut the ignition switch off. Button #2 on it's key chain remote control is valet mode which will allow 10 ignition starts and shut offs before it automatically arms. Press button #1 and then button #2 on it's key chain remote control to put it in valet mode and press button #2 and then button #1 to take it out of valet mode if you don't need to use all of the 10 ignition starts and shut offs.<br>  <br>  You can buy them here:<br>  <a href="http://www.mobilistics.com/No%20Start%20Home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mobilistics.com/No%20Start%20...</a><br>  <br>  Or here:<br>  <a href="http://vandalalert.net/vandalalert/vandal_alert_nostart.htm" rel="nofollow">http://vandalalert.net/vandalalert/vanda...</a>|`|3mo8vrpTaa	If a crook wants your car there is not much  that can stop him.  You can make it more difficult.  The club/break lock is easy to remove, only seconds to a pro.  Killing the power to the ECM is much more effective. This is much more effective then a battery kill switch.  Frustrating to the crook and they move on.  There is no defense against a roll back tow truck.
uL5772kCaa	Not familiar with XM radio, so i can't really say if you're going to need to reenter the information. But the only way to not reset a device is to keep a constant 12v on the device. I dont think you can transfer the device without unplugging it.

LVPNuEsLaa	There are two seperate issues: the value of the Cayman and the price of the 911.<br>  <br>  For KBB, be aware that there are different prices listed for private resale, trade-in, and dealer sale, so when you say the dealer is offering $6k under KBB, be sure which numbers you are looking at.  Also, the dealer pays for frequent KBB updates and probably considers your number out of date.  Regardless, the real benchmark for the value of the Cayman is the most recent auction prices - if they cannot retail it for some reason, that is the price they will eventually get.  Most dealers are loathe to go much above this price unless it is truly an exceptional car.<br>  <br>  Suggestions: (1) If you have $6k sitting around and can handle the paperwork, try to sell the Cayman yourself.  You'll get a better price.  (2) Ask the dealer for specific reasons he is offering such a low price - condition, market, etc, and try to get it on paper even of you have to write it down.  The probable reasons are that resale prices are very low right now as well as the fact that RWD sports cars sell poorly in winter (unless you are in the deep south).  (3)  Ask for the auction price - if he is being honest he should be able to show you the source he is using to price the car.  (4)  Shop your resale around.  Check out CarMax.  But accept that he might be offering you a fair deal.<br>  <br>  As for the buy price on the 911, you may have more flexibility - the price is set only by the amount of money already invested in the car vs the likelihood of selling it.  A high-demand car is hard to talk down, but one that has been sitting is ripe for picking.  Try to find other 911's for comparison and see what they are doing - you should try to work at least 1 other deal in parallel just to keep them honest.  Also, if the dealer is pricing the 911 on KBB they should be able to explain the discrepancy in the Cayman price.<br>  <br>  In short, dropping the price on the 911 is all about having other options and/or being willing to pass.  Remember that they do not get paid if you don't buy - do not be afraid to push harder, just be aware that they can and will sell it out from under you to a higher bidder.<br>  <br>  By the way, if you can afford it, go for the 911 - much better car than the Cayman.|`|2VVU7gNfaa	If you can afford a $99,999 car you really don't need financial advice from Yahoo Answers, do you?<br>  <br>  If you want some advice anyway, here it is:  If you don't plan on taking the 911 Turbo to the track where you can actually use all of its power without worrying about ending up in jail, just keep the Cayman S.  They're ripping you off on the trade-in value of your Cayman anyway.  <br>  <br>  If you were to sell the Cayman outright instead of getting burned on the trade in and you get more money than you owe on it, then I'd consider the 911 if I really wanted it, had somewhere to drive it hard, and could afford it.
RxiBpUUuaa	Here are some possibilities to consider.<br>  Potential price fixing by the industry at all levels.<br>  Their warehouses used for staging the transport and delivery are not overstocked, yet.<br>  Fuel for delivery of tires is still over two dollars a gallon.<br>  Fashion parallel; shoppers in a mall have millions of choices to assemble and complete an 'outfit'. Vehicle maintenance is also a very  individual process. Some factors are; brand loyalty, brand reputation, brand experience, aggressive marketing at the counter, bang for the buck.<br>  I have been tire shopping for over a week, online and the phone. There are at least ten competing manufacturers and several designs in the size I need. I will buy the best tires I can afford. The seller has a disincentive to bargain from MSRP down toward wholesale, because the tires currently cost the same at every shop, due to the pricing strategy used by the industry. They figure we will need tires, will buy them whatever they cost.

GtBOQPKqaa	Navistar International changed their name from International Harvester to divorce themselves from the agriculture equipment business many years ago because of the moribund nature of that industry, and to concentrate on their medium-duty truck lines.<br>  <br>  Having said that, it doesn't make sense for a truck manufacturer - which caters to commercial customers - to get into a market that caters to individuals. There is nothing really in common to both markets that would justify such an acquisition. They couldn't apply their expertise from the medium-duty truck industry to the manufacture of personal vehicles. The nature of the manufacturing processes differs.<br>  <br>  Jeeps are made on an assembly line, i.e., mass-produced, which brings prices down through economies of scale. ALL medium- and heavy-duty trucks are essentially hand-built. While specific parts may be mass-produced, the labor-intensive nature of the assembly process - because trucks are built for a specific purpose, rather than multipurpose - keeps costs and prices high.

Not a Jeep Cherokee, just a Jeep Jeep.  Well now I'm older (41) and I have a Jeep Cherokee.  Go figure!  Anyway, I like it ok, but I still want a Real Jeep.  When I test drove them, I was concerned about their inability to climb hills at a decent speed, and I'm just talking about on the highway.  What does IFS mean?  <br>  As far as International buying Jeep, I would be okay with it because I worry that Chrysler won't make it through the hard economic times we are having.  Regardless, I still want a Jeep.

Get back in the saddle & start riding. <br>  <br>  Take your time, go somewhere that has less traffic & get used to driving on back roads, side streets, etc until you feel comfortable there, then go out onto the more traveled roads & then the heavily traveled US highways & Interstates. By that time you will feel more relaxed and confident again.<br>  <br>  Take someone with you until you feel more confident, so in case you have a panic attack, they can take over & drive you home so you won't have to leave your car & have someone come back for it later.|`|3Hf3YtyKaa	Just take it SLOW- for the first two times have someone with a license in the car with you and keep telling yourself that if you want you can pull over and switch drivers.

And yes it would have been wise to have put new plugs and plug leads in too while you were at it. No damage will be done to anything but you might get rough running or neven acceleration if the plugs need changing. Take one out and look at the end of it. The part where the spark is made should be a very pale brown in colour. If it is sooty or too white then your mixture is too rich or too lean. Wire brush the end and look for wear up against the light, If the middle part is rounded on its end or the point above it worn in any way then the plugs need to be changed. If the point is flat and square edged and the central point sharp with a flat end the plug is ok. With a feelergauge check and adjust the gap between the points - refer to your cars handbook for appropriate gap.

If the gap on any of the plugs is say .03 or more above the recommended gap (see decals under hood or ask auto parts clerk), then they need replaced. If not they're good as long as they're not damaged.<br>  <br>  When your plugs become so worn they HAVE to be replaced, you'll start to notice a stumble, rough running engine and decreased mpg.  Depending on the type of plug, they should last anywhere from about 20k miles to over 50k miles.

It is normal for moisture and condensation to come out, especially in colder weather. The moisture will be dirty or black if passes through soot and grime, especially i nan old car. Does your car smoke when you accelerate, namely blueish white smoke? If this is the case the piston rings are probably shot. In english that would simply mean the inside of the motor is beat up, tired and worn out. Oil would be slipping into places that it shouldn't. It would help if you repost this question and try to tell exactly where on the motor the oil is leaking.<br>  If it is the piston ring problem, I recommend using an oil additive called "Restore." This will temporarily relieve the problem if added every few thousand miles. But if you truly have oil coming out the exhaust pipe that engine is probably shot!

HFrsH9MRaa	Remove your air intake snorkel (rubber). Thoroughly clean your throttle body and plate, make sure that they are free moving and factory clean (use Gum-out) Notice that there is a device here with a snap type wiring harness. This is the idle air control valve. It is held in place with 2 8mm screws. Remove these screws to access the valve. Flip the valve over, and clean it thoroughly. Re-install the valve. Oil vapors collect here and can cause idle and power issues. Also, check your fuel pressure regulator. If you remove the little vacuum hose and gas spurts out, it is bad and needs replacing!!! good Luck!

zjpvZ5knaa	your fuel lines could be bad or cluttered. Fuel filter might be very dirty and not cleaning the fuel like its soppoesd to, so you get more particles into the mixture. Or what i think is the problem is, you have a dirty or corroded fuel injector. If its dirty or corroded, the fuel spray will not be even, which can result in not properly igniting the fuel, and messing up your cars fuel/air mixture.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	Check your fuel pressure regulator. Also, locate and clean out thoroughly your throttle body and plate, and especially, the idle air control valve. Clean your PCV and hose, as well. Idle is affected by these factors, mostly. If the throttle body does not return to rest setting, it will signal the computer to spray too much gas, causing stutter and exhaust system meltdown. I hope you are using Bosch Platinum or Nippondenso Iridium plugs!!!|`|fwtJAsZSaa	If you're certain its not the fuel pump,filter,plugs etc, then the  problem could be with the fuel injector(dirty) or the fuel itself.  Try putting in a few bottles of fuel system cleaner(STP or shell V-power) as well as try putting shell V-power for a couple of tanks. These have a lot of additives in them which will clean up the entire fuel injection System right from the tank to the injectors and see if the situation improves.  If it was a sensor issue then youre check engine light would be on. If that is the case get a diagnosis for that.
ytgjFFq6aa	block sand the primer with 320 grit sandpaper. some oreilly autoparts supply paints call around and ask which one does near you. get your base coat and reducer for that base coat, some base coats requir an activator as well, just ask the person selling you the paint for all mixers for that base. i found that master craft clear sprays really well. you will need the clear and clear activator. to mix base coat should tell you the mixing porportions on the label, all paints differ. clearcoat is usually 4 to 1. thats 4 parts clear to one part activator. also get a wax and grease remover to wipe down the truck after you sand it and it is ready to paint. this solvent brings up all the bad chemicals that will cause fish eyes. take two balled up paper towels, one soaked in wax and grease remover and the other one plain, wipe and area with the soaked rag then immediately after wipe with the dry rag. this makies sure the surface is ready to paint. after you use the wax and grease remover then wipr it down with a tack cloth. now its spray time. make sure you are using 35 psi. spray one good coat and wait for the flash time (this means the paint looks dry but is not, kind of looks hazy) after you finish with your base coats its time for the clear. clear coat need a little more air pressure coming from the spray gun because it is thicker and it will spread it better. do one heavy coat and let flash then repeat. since you are not painting it in a booth you will catch some trash in the paint, but no worries, get 1200 grit wet or dry sandpaper and wet sand the truck. then its time to buff and it will shine like a diamond! any further questions email me at prussell@burr.com<br>  good luck!|`|hD25pT1Laa	You can't really paint modern paints without access to a spray booth. They dry too slowly to paint outside and your garage isn't clean enough, they get covered with trash from the air before they dry. You also need a good (read big compressor) air supply for your gun and another for you to breath since modern Urethane paints contain cyanide and will mess you up bad. Back in the day, you could buy lacquer which dries fast enough to spray in your driveway, and wear a dust mask to keep it out of your lungs. but lacquer contains a lot of solvents and has been outlawed because of pollution laws in most places.

tfC8BQXOaa	I am not a lawyer but the one thing I know is to never take the first offer they make.<br>  If my lawyer suggested that I did take the first offer, I would change lawyer.<br>  I am not saying that this is the best course of action for you and this might indeed backfire, I am just saying what I would do, especially if my injuries were permanent and the car driver was at fault.<br>  I would fight this to the bitter end, depending on what the injuries are of course but we should never forget that case where the woman burned her leg with that up of tea and got a million for it.<br>  I wish you good luck.|`|6VL5xzlAaa	Sorry I don't know much about this but could you get a free quote from another company to compare the offer with? or if your in england the citizens advice bureau is free and i think that can include half an hour with legal services free too so they could advice you, if you have permanent injuries it sounds like there should be a lot of compensation!|`|3a18df211e21e48356e6324c5637a526aa	You are the client, it seems to me that it is your decision as to take the offer or not.  If your lawyer does not want to pursue it further at your insistence it seems to me like he is quiting your case, you may owe him a little for the work so far, but otherwise you should be free to pursue other avenues|`|AA11348786	This is not advice ! I am not an attorney. If I were a person in this situation, I might do this.If you hired an attorney, they have a fidiuary responsibility to work in your best interest. Insurance companies partly rely on your distrust of the marriage that you and your attorney have developed, amongst other things, even though the Idea of good faith terms are always supposed to be on the table. If you don't believe that the offer is in your best interest, you have the right to decline that offer. If your attorney disagrees with your decision, and can't/won't go any farther, you may have to fire them. This happens often, but, beware of this scenario. They will however, seek thier just do for the work that they completed on your behalf.This could be costly. However, if you decide that the marriage is irrevocably damaged, your new attorney will do the firing, and you can give them some of the money that the insurance company is going to neigotiate in their best interest.|`|KRJYth01aa	all lawyers in civil instances are looking for one thing...<br>  <br>  to get the most amount of money for u with the least amount of work for themselves<br>  <br>  if u seek another opinion...it will be the same thing.... and if someone says... come to me..i will get u the most ..all that means is they will work to get u more money....but they will also take a bigger percentage<br>  <br>  always ask up front what the cost to you is going to be and if the fee is diffrent if u want to procede with a suit against the others<br>  <br>  but be warned... insurance companys have very deep pockets(lots of money) and they have lots of lawyers that they pay to fight ur attempt at getting more money , so sit down and think about how much the offer is to settle...and if u were to deposit that amount into a interest bearing acct. how much would it be worth in a few years..<br>  also..always make sure that any settlement offer includes lifetime medical payment for the injuries u received ...plus.. an actual dollar amount over and above the paying of medical bills<br>  <br>  if it doesnt sound like enough money or their is no provision for paying the doctor bills for life for injuries...then .. take them to court

344e7593a1887ba572721d442e5b401daa	All the answers thus far are good.<br>  For a starting rider, it's important to pick a bike that you can comfortably handle and isn't too heavy... For your height I'd suggest something like a Hyosung Aquila (250cc). It's lightweight has a pretty low seat height, and has a smooth power curve.<br>  My girlfriend's first bike was a 900cc Triumph Legend, but it was fine for her because the inline triple engine in it was gentle for its size.<br>  <br>  Here are some guidelines for when you go looking for a bike:<br>  250cc - 600cc range (600cc is pushing it if you get a sport bike, but it's okay if it's in a cruiser or standard). <br>  You MUST be able to put your feet flat on the ground. For a more experienced rider, it's okay to be up on the balls of your feet. However, as you learn to ride it's good to have as much stability as possible.<br>  New-ish. I'd advise you to avoid buying a brand new bike... Most riders drop their bikes as they're getting used to riding, especially at very low speeds, and it's good to get the dents out on something you haven't invested a ton of money into.<br>  The important part is not to just go and buy a bike someone suggests on here, but to find something that feels right to you. Sit on the bike. Get the dealer/ seller to hold the bike while you have your feet up on the pegs, etc. If it doesn't feel right, move on--even if it's a bike that's been highly recommended. There are tons of good bike models out there, and you should be able to find something that feels good.<br>  <br>  Good luck! It's always nice to have more people riding. :)|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	Used Yamaha Virago 750.  Enjoy.  I'm about 5'9 and my previous bike was a 1985 Yamaha Virago 700.

Do you want something for touring or just what are your goals for the use of the bike?  We can ride anything any man can-unless height considerations get in the way.  After all we are not pushing or carrying them, we are riding them.<br>  <br>  BMW makes some great bikes that are wonderful if you have enough inseem to handle them.  They are powerful but not overly powerful-lets face it almost any motorcycle can land you on your keyster except perhaps the 125s and most 250 cruisers,  Those things just say "I think I can-almost".|`|gOQ5mZ7Xaa	An older Kawasaki ZX-2R Ninja, Honda CBR250R or the new Kawasaki ZXR250 Ninja would work perfectly if you're into sports bikes, but if you want something bigger the Suzuki SV650 is a great ride and a nice big naked bike. If you ever want to move up, perhaps look into a Buell, Harley-Davidson or a Triumph (Buell use Harley engines in tight frames for greater performance and less weight, Harleys are the ultimate in cruiser comforts, and Triumphs do both naked and sports bikes ranging from 675cc to 1100+cc. They use 3-cylinder engines). A great step up from the SV650 would be Triumph's Street/Speed Triple, or the Daytona 675.|`|fl60KL8oaa	The 250cc 'starter bikes' all run about 300 pounds dry.  The over 400cc not dual sport bikes all weigh over 400 pounds, except for one.<br>  <br>  The exception to the rules is Suzuki's S40, or Savage if you go back a few years.  Same bike, has been in continuous production since 1986.   Although it is 400cc larger than the 250's, it is only 50 pounds heavier.   652cc, but neither too heavy nor too powerful.  It only produces about 30-33 hp and tops out at a mere 85 mph.  But being a big single it has a fat torque curve that, with it's light weight, makes it quick off the line.<br>  <br>  The broad powerband makes for easy riding.  I can merge with 65 mph freeway traffic in third gear.  If I'm being lazy I can not bother downshifting and the bike will pull from 30 mph to top speed in fifth gear.<br>  <br>  I've had mine for over four years / 21,000 miles.

Yeah it's fun but you will get tired of it and want more.  I speak from experience.  My first bike was a 01 GS500 I bought used.  I rode it for a year and it was fun, don't get me wrong, but it really lacked everything.  Comfort, handling, stability, etc.   Then I bought brand new my 04 SV650S which I love!

Before I bought my car i looked at the Lexus Rx350 and the RX400h, the BMW X5, the Toyota Rav4 and Highlander and the Honda Pilot and the Porsche Cayenne. I don't regret my decision at all. It has great stability and I feel very safe in it. As there are crazy people on the road, a safe car is what you need. And you can't beat the wonderful service you get at mercedes.|`|bY4DLWboaa	It's a superb car, you won't be disappointed.

0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	So many of these were sold in white that finding a white replacement shouldn't be a problem.  Call the local salvage yards; they may charge as little as $35.  They go on with simple hand tools.  Want me to go take mine apart and tell you how?  The last one I did had a triangular piece of trim on the inside of the door; pry it off. Then there were three nuts holding the mirror base.  If it's electric, tag the wires and make sure you plug them back where they were originally.  If you get them wrong, your mirror will work backwards.<br>  <br>  Cheer up.  This is one of the easiest and cheapest things to fix.  Don't go to a body shop for this.<br>  <br>  I went to the store and checked mine ('93) first. The trim inside is easy to pry off and snap back, and the mirror assembly is attached by three phillips (X) screws.  The wires are on a plug so you can't mix them up.|`|EMC7JwVBaa	Find a used one at an auto salvage yard. Paint it to match the car if it doesn't. The dealer is going to kill you with the price for a new one. If it's not an automatic mirror you can probably do the replacement with a screwdriver. Look in Chiltons Auto Repair manual at the library, or buy one for about $20, and it'll tell you how to do the job. OR, you can pay a shop to do it. $$$.|`|8468bdfd89a4b2535048ee892787ee1aaa	I would recommend going to a reputable auto body shop for an estimate and repair.  There they can price out used and aftermarket replacement (aftermarket is priced lower).  At least get an estimate to know how much it would be, but my guess is that it will cost about $250 (part, paint, and install on aftermarket mirror).|`|Hrn7JsqNaa	Another new one,maybe a second hand market !

HFrsH9MRaa	The 300E is one of the most highly valued cars out there. It is dependable, efficient, comfortable, and long lasting. Have the chassis checked for rust issues, though. The fuel injection system, CIS E-III is fantastic. Install a set of Bosch platinum or Nippondenso Iridium plugs.Most common problem areas are suspension components in rear of car that wear out with age Brake pads are cheap and parts are easy to find. You should get around 28 MPG with this car. If you don't e-mail me back and I will tell you how to achieve this!!! All these vehicles are well designed and produced. Use only synthetic oil and have the chassis checked frquently for signs of rust. Stop the rust, quickly!!! The MB gets the best mileage.

QEgpIxuKaa	I have a 99 SLK230 and I really don't push it like that but have had to accelerate to 60 from a dead stop on a free-way a few times.  My guess would be slightly under 7 seconds.  The car does much better in the 40 to 80 range and I am just amazed at how quick it can pass another car traveling about 55.  My guess is that it only take about 3 seconds from 40 to 80 and I assume it has a lot to do with the gearing and the RPM range.  Anyway, the car is a blast to drive and I always tell people who ask that it is just like driving a real fast go-cart.
b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	You'll adjust to the new riding position, and after you do, you'll be okay.<br>  If Magz were here, he'd tell you that you shouldn't be supporting your weight on your hands :)<br>  <br>  I feel your pain.  I'm in the process of adjusting from cruiser to sport-touring myself.  I'm two weeks into it and figure it'll be another week before I'm fully adjusted to it.|`|E0j6mhqhaa	I think it's more the rider/bike relationship than is it a particular bike category.  Like bluejeans, what fits one person perfectly may kill the next one.  <br>  <br>  Adjusting the handlebars can often make a big difference, but some positions are designed for certain speeds and riding styles.  The crouched over position so popular on sport bikes was originally the same position found on unfaired racing bikes way back when.  At slow speeds, a lot of weight was on your hands and arms but at speed, the wind blast on your chest reduced that weight.  An upright, cruiser style position on an unfaired bike is great at low speeds but at high speeds is like doing a 70 mph chin up which is very tiring.  <br>  <br>  In general, any unfaired bike is going to be fatiguing to ride at high speeds for any distance.  Because of their aggressive, crouched over position, sport bikes tend to be less comfortable on the long haul than is a true touring bike.|`|72ddVB2iaa	When I first got my GSX-R, my wrists, neck and back hurt. Then someone told me how to get proper riding position. Now it feels odd and too upright to ride my Buell Cyclone and that is actually a fairly sporty riding position for a standard. <br>  <br>  You need to use your knees and inner thighs to grip the tank, and then stiffen your back muscles like a spring. There is almost no pressure on your arms or wrists that way. It really helped. <br>  <br>  Also, it helps a lot to keep yourself in shape.<br>  <br>  I still don't like it for more than a few hours at a time without a rest, but by then it's time to fuel up anyway. <br>  <br>  That's just my personal experience though.|`|qkAoxusxaa	my cousin rides street bikes... and he use to ride a hayabusa, he said that it was really uncomfortable, like what you said, then he got a zx-14 ninja, and he said that it was much more comfortable...<br>  <br>  so it might really be the bikes, but im not 100% sure...|`|lM9NvSwnaa	I find sport bikes to be more comfortable for my back and neck because of the forward riding position, than my cruiser which has me sitting much more upright.<br>  <br>  And I have back and neck problems.|`|jFwuiRKxaa	Yes they do|`|j2RFvzPHaa	they can at first, but as you get used to the riding position and just have fun it goes away!. i find that if i get "scared" when coming to a newer higher dune or somethin like that, i tense up, and that causes the pain to come! haha, but i also found that the more i work out regularly, the less pain i experience and more fun i experience when riding:)<br>  its AMAZING!|`|DwBNz5kVaa	The position can cause back, neck, wrist pain but there are modifications that can be done to make it easier on the rider. As a rule of thumb though sport bikes have the most aggressive riding positions because they mimic the same motorcycles used to race around a track.
2VVU7gNfaa	The Cougar should outrun the Grand Prix to 60mph and all the way through a 1/4 mile.  The 1/4 mile times for the two cars should be roughly 16.0 seconds for a stock Cougar 2.5 5spd and about 16.8 sec for the Grand Prix.   <br>  <br>  To top speed I would imagine the result would be the same, at least unless the Cougar has a speed governor on it at some speed before the Grand Prix runs out of steam.

From personal experience I have noticed just last month that i only got 36mpg compared to the usual 43  (+ /- 2 miles). Couldnt find the cause until I checked my tyre pressures. Front and rear should be 34lbs. Front was ok, rear was 15 on one side and 22 on the other. Have refuelled since then and got 42mpg. - Result !!  Airconditioning or open windows could also influence your fuel consumption by 10%|`|oPy0n9nGaa	You need to tune your car up.

Fuel left in vehicles under normal temperatures in the sun and full of gas lose a very small amount of fuel from evaporation .You have to remember wherever it is parked it would be a little cooler under the vehicle ,but the surrounding area will be at higher temperature because the heat rises and will pull the cooler air up with it .<br>  High temperature say in PHOENIX AZ. in the summer in 110 - 120 degrees and you park on blacktop and leave your car there say all week a full tank could drop to say 7/8 on the high side or only lose as much as a gallon only .The lighter the color the cooler the car and less evaporation.<br>  People out there have been known to cook their lunches on their dash boards of their cars while parked on a blacktop parking lot there .<br>  You can call a local radio station about it if you wish its a prov-en fact.<br>  And they occasionally for fun cook an egg on the blacktop to determine how long it would take to cook your bare skin on your foot(LIKE A 1 MINUTE OR SO EGG).|`|VCdetbaQaa	well unless you did something to it your gas tank is on the underside of the vehicle and shaded for direct sunlight...which helps prevent it from heating up inside.. but the ignition point of gasoline is higher than what sunlight can do when shining on the car for long periods of time if I'm not mistaken...It would take direct sunlight for extended periods of time for the air in the gas tank to heat up and expand let alone cause enough compression and heat to cause the gas to combust.

This goes double for cars driven in harsh climates like the Northeastern United States. <br>  <br>  Within the next couple years one would think the starter and alternator would probably fail, they usually go out around the 100 thousand mile mark. Not major fixes here but sort of pricey. The cooling system would also be of some concern. I also be worried about whether the brake lines are starting to rust out, pretty common occurrence where ever they use salt on the roads to melt snow. Replacing them is a major expense because of the labor involved. <br>  <br>  If you're serious about buying the car take it to a mechanic you trust and have it inspected, worth the price.|`|645f18865ac05bd21df6fca545da961daa	96' oldsmobile coupe ~automatic 2door says best BEST OFFER, does not mention mileage, <br>  <br>  for 96 mileage would be average around 20k x X = 120k , so its lower but about right, images show some wear on interior, an until you start engine and view exhaust color, engines condition varies, if white or black smoke is constant, then rings or valves may need repair, at this age, some suspensions parts may require updating, this may be ok for another three years if in good condition, <br>  <br>  check blue book value, lemon book value, and your insurance value, not clear on safety rules there, but with out safety check for road worthiness, prices would be lower, <br>  <br>   Kelley Blue Book<br>  <a href="http://www.kbb.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kbb.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kbb.com/KBB/UsedCars/PricingReport.aspx?WebCategoryId=35&YearId=1996&Mileage=102000&VehicleClass=UsedCar&ManufacturerId=36&ModelId=468&PriceType=Private+Party&VehicleId=9560&SelectionHistory=9560%7c30081%7c07011%7c0%7c0%7c&Condition=Good&QuizConditions=" rel="nofollow">http://www.kbb.com/KBB/UsedCars/PricingR...</a><br>  guestimate <br>   Condition Value<br>   Excellent $1,345<br>  Good $1,145<br>  Fair $820<br>  ________<br>  <br>  Lemon aid cars <br>  <a href="http://www.lemonaidcars.com/about.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lemonaidcars.com/about.html</a><br>  _________<br>  <br>  State Farm insurance<br>  <a href="http://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto_insurance/ins_auto_price.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto_...</a><br>  calculator<br>  <a href="http://www.statefarm.com/learning/calc/calc.asp#auto" rel="nofollow">http://www.statefarm.com/learning/calc/c...</a><br>  ..|`|TJ2EfH7oaa	Listen, as long as the car had a responsible owner before you, it will be FINE!  by responsible, I mean one who changes the oil regularly, and does other preventative maintenance.<br>  <br>  These days, 102k miles is not all that much.

SIpnLbcMaa	It either means that one of the bulbs in the loop on that side of the bike has gone out or the bulb is the incorrect size. Size, meaning wrong voltage. Another reason could be a bad ground. I'm assuming you do not have much knowledge in electronics or you would not be asking this question. A ground is a wire from the loop that in this case would be connected to part of the frame. If it is no longer connected, it may cause the lights to flash at a faster rate, as more electricity then intended is entering the loop. This extra electricity will make it blink at a faster rate which will eventually blow out the bulb, thus causing the other to blink more quickly and inevitably do the same thing. This will happen if any part of the loop is added electricity whether it is an incomplete ground, a weaker bulb using less energy than intended or a bulb not using energy so the other gets more than intended. I hope this didn't confuse you. <br>  <br>  If i were you i would take it to a professional seeing as how you do not have the knowledge yourself. Good luck.|`|E0j6mhqhaa	It means more current (electricity) is being pulled through the flasher relay than the relay is designed for.

HFrsH9MRaa	What kind of car is this????? Nearly every oil producer has products with different synthetic content. Even more important than this is, whether either oil you are using conforms to the factories require-ments. For example, if you own a VW, you must use oil that conforms to VW spec 402/405.A BMW requires a different set of chemical properties for use in their cars, as does Mercedes Benz!l If you are driving an Asian car, the oil must conform to ASEA specifications. Get it??? I personally will probably never use anything BUT full synthetic in ANY car (except a Mazda rotary). It just doesn't make sense!! But I ALWAYS look for the name of the car manu-facturer in the "approved for use in" column. Stay away from "bulk" oil.Regular oil ALWAYS deteriorates and leaves sludge and varnish and other unwanted deposits. A good synthetic oil protects best, lasts longest, and cleans the engine as you drive. In many cases, oil change intervals can be tripled! Regular oils chemically are harder on piston rings, hydraulic components, seals, pumps, chain tensioners, just by their inherent nature to BREAK DOWN under heat and stress. This is why there are so many de-sludging agents on the market. There is a REASON for this!!!|`|Dbj8pU8haa	Sure it is.  No worries.  I would be careful of the grade.

tdqD9DcSaa	Mostly all lawn mowers without gas/oil mix use 87 octane. As for your 2 cycle equipment I would first read your owners manual because in some higher priced equipment they use 89 octane and request that you use there dealer approved oil. It can also go as far as to void the warranty of the equipment if requirements are not met. Also remember gas/oil mix has a ratio that is required for that piece of equipment or it will encounter problems. Not all equipment are created equal, so that is why they give you an owners manual to understand what its needs are. Just like equipment gas is not create equal either.<br>  <br>  Hope This Helped|`|JkTGq2BJaa	the cars of today are built to run on 87 octane or higher. You can spend what you want for fuel but the fact is that most of the cars do not run hot enough plugs to burn the higher octane fuel and benefit from it. The cars that are, you will know because they are built for higher performance like  corvette. Otherwise your making the fuel manufacturers fatter and happier.|`|2vL8wOHZaa	For your mower and weed eater,etc you are just wasting your money using a higher octane fuel in them. Stick with the regular fuel for those. In your car you may see a slight increase in fuel mileage with the higher octane. I hope this helped.|`|RiQA4Epraa	just use regular..<br>  its a chainsaw...|`|zOIgzIy4aa	i just use regular in both my chainsaw and mower and even the weed eater. you don,t need super for those|`|HFrsH9MRaa	No lawn maintenance equipment has high compression engines, or turbo engines. You are wasting money on premium gas. If you want better performance, install a set of NGK or Nippondenso plugs. These will produce more power due to their more efficient design. Also, when the season ends, use a litlle bit of "Stabil" fuel treatment to prevent fuel bowl rusting and fuel deterioration over the winter. Good Luck!!

c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	What do you mean?  If you've read my other posts to your questions, it should be obvious that you ABSOLUTELY must be an officer to be a pilot or nav in the USAF, USN, USMC.<br>  There's three types of officers: Line, JAG, and Medical Corps.  Everybody but lawyers, judges, and docs/dentists are Line; ergo aircrew are line officers.<br>  I've known of two Nav's who went to med school and came back as Flight Docs, but never the other way around.<br>  If you mean active-duty as opposed to Reserve/Guard, then the answer is: not necessarily.  The Guard does have limited numbers of 2Lt slots available-how many if any depends on the Wing.  There's only one Reserve Fighter Wing the 419th at Hill-they're never short of crews from the active component wishing to join.  But you don't know if you don't ask.

So even if you cancel after 8 months the credit provider still wants their full amount and there could be a cancellation fee too.<br>  <br>  As for the other matter. Yes you can insure 2 cars on separate policy's with separate insurers but you can't use any existing NCB on both, it's one or the other.|`|de292ad47a31aedcb683cf279d2cb997aa	1.

With the help of Louis Gosset Jr. and several other Airforce kids, they manage to sneak 2 F-16 to set up a rescue mission. 1 F-16 piloted by Louis Gosset crashed midway and left young pilot to proceed with the mission where it managed to shot down several arab aircraft and eventually rescue his father.|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	"...the movie does have to do with aviation."<br>  Only very tangentially, it's more a teen fantasy than any sort of aviation movie, but to each their own....<br>  Netflix: then you don't have to buy it and can keep as long as you wish.

kOCtAVXwaa	try to find yourself a nice Euro shop.  If you see VW's or Audi's in there driveway, your good to go.  Depending on how cool they are, they will give you a decent deal.  <br>  <br>  One thing to think of, is the price of the o2 sensor.  Im a technician, and one thing to think of is the price of the part.  I know for a fact VW sells the same exact sensor as the Audi, except with a different connector for about a quarter of the price, 200 for audi or 50 for VW.  If your mechanic is cool, ask him, and maybe hell just splice the wires for you using your old connector, and the new VW sensor.  <br>  <br>  An old trick I used to do on my Audi S4 race car, since running race gas would burn them up haha.  Have fun, Audi is a very high quality car, dont go to M.B. or BMW.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|tKWwZpOAaa	Came across this for my A4 a while back while i was searching for a different part at an auto shop, they wanted around 200 for the sensor and harness. Any decent shop should be able to do it, if your somewhat handy with car its not to hard of a DIY fix. Check out audidiy.com|`|f60f9dd363f9ce088c134896470f9277aa	it is an electrical part that sends an arc of electricity into your exaust the more co2 the stronger the arc so your computer can tell if you are running rich or lean. without it the computer will default to a preset. easy to install yourself or any mechanic can for you.<br>  $100-200 for the sensor|`|sRbF7zgyaa	Make sure its the sensor.

r0FkeXtVaa	It may sound easy that anyone can just put plugs in a car but I will tell you as a professional tech that almost every week I get customers who have taken their Saab to a general repair shop for simple repairs or do it themselves and now something is wrong with their Saab as a direct consequence of the other repairs. Last week while performing a major service, I was unable to remove a spark plug. Turns out that customers brother replaced the plugs previous year and cross threaded the plug in the Cyl head. Cost of correction $175 vs cost of plug replacement of $75. Believe me when I tell you this, it is much cheaper to have a professional saab tech do the job.<br>  <br>  As far as what your Saab needs. I do not know any service that only requires Belt and plug replacements. Majority of Saabs on the road that does not get repaired and serviced by Saab repair shop end of failing and breaking down more often and cost much much more to keep running over the years. Your model saab requires a service that involves much more than just replacing few parts. Pay attention to the list of inspection items and make sure some one who knows your car gets to look at it. This way you dont end of driving with a worn out hose or a leak and then end up having to pay much more to get it fixed after it fails. <br>  <br>  Now from your question, it sound like you have never replaced a spark plug or belt. If you did then you would know where the plugs are located and by looking at it would have known what to do. If you think that you are saving money, think twice and be ready to keep towing your Saab to a repair shop for work that can be spotted and fixed ahead of time by a pro. You know the old saying;<br>  <br>  "YOU CAN PAY ME NOW OR YOU CAN PAY ME LATER"<br>  <br>  Here is a very sound advise, Take an Automotive course at the local college or trade school and get yourself familiarized with the type of car repairs you want to be doing. This way you can fix your own car and know how to fix it for the rest of your life. <br>  Good Luck.|`|hEZaWs9yaa	Assume this is a sedan, conv. is older model. Change plugs at 90k mls.

MmTe8W8uaa	What makes you think the truck is actually his?  <br>  <br>  Assuming that it is not stolen:<br>  <br>  The first step is for whomever's name was on the missing title from Mississippi to apply for a duplicate title certificate from Mississippi.  After receiving it, the second step is for that person to sign that title over to you and give you the signed title from Mississippi.  The third step is for you to bring the signed Mississippi when you apply for a Kentucky title and registration.<br>  <br>  Do not drive the vehicle until Mississippi has issued a duplicate title and you have received it.  If the vehicle is reported stolen, a handwritten receipt will not be sufficient to prove that you own it.
qjg0g5WMaa	well common problem on these is the bushing on the tv(kickdown) cable its plastic where it connects to the throttle dont drive it until you fix it or you'll have a "clutched" trans usually trans shop sell a metal replacement but a plastic will do the job if you cant find the metal one button on the side sometimes for adjustment (by throttle cable mount) but its usually the bushing(costs $2.99)<br>  good luck|`|niskyMHRaa	should be close to the kickdown, see what connects to the kickdown.
02a3aa56f12facd0557c683d42ccc66baa	Besides the obvious reason that if it drained dry, a leak from the cylinder head area might possibly be loose or warped valve covers, bad valve cover gaskets, timing chain or gear cover/gasket or a bit of debris may have wedged itself into the head gasket area, temporarily stopping the flow. Of course, if it was just some spilled oil it may have just burned off.|`|tFfUMQtyaa	Why the hell did you buy a shitron!|`|4biGrjPkaa	Never heard of an oil leak stopping on its own in the 18 years that I've been playing with cars.

I should note that I drove a Ford Ranger that was missing badly and would suck a dollar back in the tail pipe.  Turned out to be a bad coil pack.  It is not common any more for newer vehicles to burn valves that leaves the other options.  A compression test will find the offending cylinder.|`|EMC7JwVBaa	Sounds more like a broken piston that a bad valve- or both. Pressure in the crank case is compression  getting past the piston. The surging at the tailpipe could just be valve overlap  or the action of the exhaust gas resurculator valve.|`|MnmNl6Hiaa	yes you probably have stuck valve|`|Gn0nR2S1aa	Sounds like a valve train problem. Could be any of the components being bent, stuck or burnt. Best advice would be to check the timing components, then do a compression test and see if one of the cylinders shows a fault.|`|N0UUmjDlaa	Your engine is either totally shot, or it has a blockage in the crankcase breather.

Gn0nR2S1aa	If you wrecked and poked the radiator, then the green fluid would be engine coolant and you should not drive the car untill its fixed or the engine will overheat and then you will be replacing the engine also.|`|N0UUmjDlaa	You jest?<br>  First, your radiator is shot. Secondly, if you have aircon in your whatever car, its radiator is probably also shot. <br>  For anything else, you actually need to lift the hood and look!<br>  Looking might reveal a host of associated problems. Could even be engine damage, if a towing hitch was involved.|`|1NK1hK1Taa	Yes the green fluid is the antifreeze in the coolant. You need to replace the radiator and the grill too. Plus whatever else got damaged. Don't run your engine until you have got the radiator replaced and the cooling system refilled with the correct mixture of water and antifreeze. Don't think that because the winter has ended that you don't require antifreeze. You do. It not only prevents your coolant from freezing inside the engine, it also contains rust inhibitors. <br>  Your engine needs a pressurised system to run at the correct temperature, so don't be tempted to run your car and keep topping up the level.<br>  <br>  Oh, and avoid driving into anything with a towbar fitted.

zjpvZ5knaa	If its not starting, the clicking is because there is not enough power to turn the alternator and the starter. I think it is probably a matter of a dead battery or a failed alternator (if the alternator is dead then the battery will be too since the battery is not getting charged from the alternator.) When my truck wouldn't start, it made the clicking noise and the rpm meter was all wacky, and it was b/c the alternator was dead. If you can, get somebody with jumper cables to jump you, and follow you (if its the alternator is dead the jump will only last you about a minute before it dies again so you will need some1 to jump you repeatedly) to an mechanic shop to get the alternator/battery tested.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	i don,t think it,s the motor. check the battery terminals to see if they are corroded or loose then if it don,t start try tapping on the starter, they stick sometimes.|`|yyIVrngcaa	your battery is most likely dead....happened to me with mine...have someone give you a jump, or whatever they call it.|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	Sounds like a dying battery to me.  Have you tried to see if you can jump it off?  That clicking noise you are describing sounds like the ignition coil or maybe the starter solenoid.<br>  <br>  If you can't jump the car off or the battery is good and it still will not start, then you can make a short across the terminals of the ignition coil and see if it turns over then.  If it does, then the coil needs to be replaced.
JkTGq2BJaa	If he put larger rims with the low profile tires and you go back to regular tires on the same rims you will probably not get accurate mileage readings on you odometer and  depending on the vehicle you could also damage the trans. So i would recommend replacing the rims as well if you want to get a regular tire.|`|hLOYwnsUaa	Yeah you can put regular tire's on there instead of low profile one's (depending on the size) However Nothing beats the look of low profile tires.  I wouldn't change the size personally.|`|qJJW4AQ2aa	Depends on both parts. The shop has to have a machine that doesn't damage the rim for them to even touch it. Second, depending on the size of your wheel well you could go for standard tires. Low Pro are only to help with the fitting of the wheel into the wheel well. Good Luck.
t2XRy9G5aa	yes, the gas cap should be vented with either a hose coming out of the middle and routed up into the center of the steering stem OR a short hose that has a check valve breather.<br>  <br>  you will not want to ride without one of these in place as you will be wearing gasoline on your legs that will splash out the hole in the gas cap.  likewise, it will dull & discolor your gas tank, shrouds, etc.

U24VtSlZaa	It's a 2-stroke.<br>  <br>  12-volt.  550 CCA is more than enough for that motor.  Dual use cranking/deepcycle would be a good choice.  Get a marine battery, they're made tougher to withstand shock/vibration in a boating environment.<br>  Use only fresh 87-octane gasoline mixed 50:1 with TCW3 certified oil.  An ounce of Seafoam per gallon of gas will help keep the carb from getting gummed up and also prevent carbon build-up in the cylinders.<br>  Spark plugs should be Champion J4C gapped at .030 -- don't use NGK they aren't an exact match for heat range.<br>  Point gap .010<br>  <br>  Slow speed mixture adjustment:<br>  Start by screwing the slow speed adjustment screw just until it seats gently, then back it out 1-1/2 turns.  Start the engine and set the rpms to where it just stays running. Turn valve in increments of 1/8 turn, giving the engine a few seconds to respond. As you turn the valve in, the rpms will increase.  Each time, Lower the rpms again to where the engine will just stay running.  Eventually you'll hit the point where the engine wants to die out or it will spit back (sounds like a mild backfire). At that point, back out the valve 1/4 turn. Within that 1/4 turn, you'll find the smoothest slow speed setting.  When you have finished the above adjustment, you will have no reason to adjust it again unless the carburetor fouls/gums up from sitting, in which case you would be required to remove, clean, and rebuild the carburetor anyway.<br>  <br>  Never run the motor without supplying water to the lower unit -- it only takes about two minutes dry running to ruin the water pump impeller.<br>  <br>  Change the gear oil annually.  Evidence of water or metal in the oil is a reason for concern.  Small amount of metal shavings on the drain plug magnet is normal.<br>  <br>  Change the water pump impeller every 2-3 years.  Do it now if you don't know when the last change was.  Full pump kit if the housing is scored or damaged.|`|6HMTlQMaaa	Get a dual purpose battery (starting and deep cycle) large as you can afford. <br>  <br>  Gonna need more information on the engine to decide if 2 cycle or not.<br>  <br>  Edit: Yep, she is a 2 cycle and the oil mixture is 50:1, that is approximately 2.5 ounces of oil to one gallon of gas. One pint of oil to a 6 gallon can. Use TCW3 rated outboard oil.|`|AA12342588	I will assume that the motor is not brand new. It is most likely a 2 stroke engine. Pre-mix ratio is 50:1. 1/2 litre of oil added to the 25 litre fuel tank will do it. As for the battery, any 12 volt automotive type battery will work. Chose one according to your budget but be sure to select one with matching terminals ie top post vs side post type batteries.
MccqAZSNaa	The sticker that comes with any new vehicle (law requires dealers to give you it) will tell you where the parts came from and where it was assembled, but new vehicles don't have a history so there is really no history report.<br>  <br>  With buying a used vehicles, dealers will provide you with a CarFax report that normally costs something, but they'll give it to you for free. So if your new truck was actually a used truck, go back to the dealer and see if they'll give you a CarFax report.|`|eZj1qCd7aa	um no...|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Sorry, but no there are no free history reports. Carfax charges $29.99 and AutoCheck charges $14.99.|`|AA11914369	No, there are not.  And if you bought a NEW truck, there is no history, it was put together and you are the first owner.

CdW7K8weaa	Go to Costco and shop till you drop! Oh yeah, pick up some tires while you are there. Michelin's are one of the best brands, as well as Bridgestone & Dunlap. The correct size should be on the manufacturers label on the driver's side area where the door closes, just in case you want to check it.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	Use the "Tire Rack" web-site as a source for comparison. They have a section where tires for cars like yours are tested on a track and compared to others in it's class. Personally, I would never use anything but a Bridgestone or Michelin, unless the "Tire Rack" recommends a different kind for a good reason. All tires are designed to have certain characteristics, they are usually a mixture of hard and soft rubber with different tread designs. Some Japanese tires are silent and hold like super glue. Read their comparison tests, they are VERY revealing. Also, you get what you pay for!! Learn to read the sidewall ratings for treadwear, traction, and temperature. Although there are other factors to consider, this is generally agood indicator for the life expectancy and responsiveness of the tire. Good Luck!!

He was on my left and wasn't looking back as he admitted to me that he was watching the car to his right because they parked to close to him.  Guess what, his insurance only paid me for half of the damages because in a parking lot there is no right of way like a regular street and they said that they could not determine if it was his fault or mine.  So, I got half the money and never fixed my dent.  Since you were stopped and he was moving I would say it's his fault no matter what because he didn't watch where he was going.

gOQ5mZ7Xaa	Bucket seats are like semi-sports/semi-racing seats. They have edges that curve and sort of "hug" your body within the seats so you don't get thrown about too much by gravity forces. For an example, here is a conventional seat:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i.ehow.com/images/GlobalPhoto/Articles/2111375/CarSeat-main_Full.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.ehow.com/images/GlobalPhoto/Art...</a><br>  <br>  And this is a bucket seat:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rallysportdirect.com/shop/images/265000508c.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.rallysportdirect.com/shop/ima...</a>|`|lXIKeJQ8aa	Basically there are two types of car seats 1 is the bench seat that goes across the car in one piece as a bench. These can be made as one piece or as in the case of two door cars that need access to the back seat they would be split and one section fold forward. 2 Bucket seats. In this configuration each seat is an individual unit, adjustable separately. The bucket seats are to hold the passenger and driver in position more effectively.

You borrowed the money and now you owe it. <br>  <br>  If you "let the car go back" you are charged with a repossession. The car will be sold at wholesale dealer auction and you will be sued for the remainder of your loan balance. Furthermore, your credit is seriously damaged for seven years, preventing you from getting another loan in that period.<br>  <br>  I'm really surprised that a loan company would approve a $12K loan for a car only worth $5K. But that's why we're in a credit crisis right now. Too many lenders were approving loans they shouldn't have approved.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	You made a bad deal, for whatever reason. You signed a contract and you are responsible for paying back the money you borrowed to buy it. The right thing to do is to learn from this, honor your commitment, and keep paying for it. If you let them repo the car, you still owe the money and you will ruin your credit for the next seven years.|`|iqMPvr7Taa	If you let it go back you still owe the money for the loan.

bqLvWpcZaa	It's ESP ( Electronic Stability Platform ), not ESB.  If you're lucky, it's the brake switch ( a $20 part ) that's gone but it could also be the shifter mechanism itself if the ML430 is a 2000 or newer.  If it's a 1999 model, it may be the gear recognition switch.  That gear switch could be purchased separately in 1999 but in 2000 and newer, it's integrated into the gear shifter assembly.|`|86692840fce86f8a24dea58512123d09aa	in my c class the esb button is on the dash above the stereo.

In a 89 F-150 you probably have (unless someone changed them) the hard plastic vac. lines.  These, to put in bluntly, suck.  They are known to get very brittle after just a few years of being on the vehicle, and from everyday use.  With that in mind be very carefull when you check them out, so that you don't end up breaking one that might actually be in decent shape.  Besides this is a really easy thing to check, and it won't cost a dime or much time at all.  I hate to see you spend money fixing or changing out parts that you don't need to.  It is about 12.00 to replace all the vacuum lines with some 3/8 in rubber hose.  Works great too, did it to my f-150 about a years ago.....
54jCmmI4aa	If the end objective is to improve the quality of cars on the U.S. market, it is likely far better to let GM go bust. Here is a short summary of the quality differences between the products of General Motors and those of Toyota.<br>  <br>  1. General Motors dominates Consumer Reports' 2009 list of the Least Reliable Vehicles, accounting for 33.3% of the entries on the list. Toyota Motor dominates Consumer Reports' 2009 list of the Most Reliable Vehicles, accounting for 43.5% of the entries on the list, and has no entries on Consumer Reports' 2009 list of the Least Reliable Vehicles. See:<br>  <br>  December 2008 issue of Consumer Reports, p. 65<br>  <a href="http://www.autooninfo.net/NAEd200811BestandWorstCarsbyCR.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.autooninfo.net/NAEd200811Best...</a> .<br>  <br>  2. General Motors dominates AutoOnInfo.net's list of the Worst Automobiles of 2009, accounting for 32% of the entries on the list. Toyota Motor dominates both of AutoOnInfo.net's 2 lists of the Best Automobiles of 2009, accounting for 70% of the entries on the Best list based on the 10 most-recent model years and 57% of the entries on the Best list based on the 5 most-recent model years. Toyota has no entries on the Worst list.

General Motors' lines dominate the Five Worst lines by the 2009 Composite Reliability Average, accounting for 3 of the 5 worst, and Toyota Motor's lines dominate the Five Best lines by the 2009 Composite Reliability Average, accounting for 3 of the 5 best. See:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.autooninfo.net/NAEd200812TheCompositeReliabilityLineAverages.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.autooninfo.net/NAEd200812TheC...</a> .<br>  <br>  4.

See:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.autooninfo.net/ReliabilityPercentranksMotorVehicle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.autooninfo.net/ReliabilityPer...</a> .<br>  <br>  5. AutoOnInfo.net's detailed reliability and durability studies suggest that a typical 3-year-old General Motors vehicle will be about as troublesome to own as a typical 19-year-old Toyota vehicle, and a typical 5-year-old General Motors vehicle will be about as troublesome to own as a typical 25-year-old Toyota vehicle. See:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.autooninfo.net/DurabilityInformationPage11.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.autooninfo.net/DurabilityInfo...</a> .<br>  <br>  6. The reliability gap between 6-to-8-year-old Toyota vehicles and 6-to-8-year-old GM vehicles has increased from a spread of .54, on a scale 2 units wide, at the end of the 1980s to a spread of .84 at the end of the 1990s.

If GM goes so does the standard of living in this country, and I promise you the price of vehicles will double in a matter of a couple of years if this happens.<br>  --------------<br>  <br>  <br>  What makes you think the standard of living in the USA is all that great right now as it is?<br>  <br>  The value of the dollar is dirt.  Thankfully, most every other currency is worth pocket lint.<br>  <br>  You raise good points, but GM's net worth of negative $48 billion and about $200 billion in debt liabilities is a bigger immediate concern.  They can't pay their bills.|`|AA11264416	like you just said its a LOAN so all the automakers have to pay their loans back so the government will get that money back over time, if they make the people go on welfare then they won't get that welfare money back, and just so you know chrysler also is asking for a 2nd bailout not just GM so thats even more welfare money the government won't get back|`|I38WF5aFaa	Chapter 11 bankruptcy doesn't mean GM will go out of business.  It means they renegotiate payment on their debt.  It also means the union contract will be renegotiated.  That's why the union is so against bankruptcy.  It would mean reductions of benefits,  pay cuts and new job descriptions.  But that's not the big thing.  Under the current union rules an employee can not do anything but his one job.  The guy on the loading dock can't drive a forklift in the warehouse, that's someone else's job.  He can't even sweep the dock floor.  When those rules are rewritten there won't be a need for so many positions.  The way things are now some people only work 2 or 3 hours of their 8 hour day.  They can't be given a different assignment to fill their dead time.  That's why GM needs to go into chapter 11.  Get rid of union work rules like that and they could reduce the price of every car $2000 or more.|`|dCuWCbRkaa	This is a touchy situation.  GM directly and indirectly employs many more people than what you are assuming.  There are parts suppliers and dealerships that would go under if GM went under.  As you can see by my screen name, I'm a big supporter of the Big Three.  Lately though, all the criticism and negative talks about more loans has been driving me a little bit nuts.  People have been on GM and Chrysler's tail about every little thing, and the companies are not going to sell any more cars if people keep complaining.  Granted, these people probably live in Alabama or California and have jobs at a PT office, a law firm, a financial institution, or maybe even McDonald's and could care less about what happens to anybody but their self.  If we let one or more of the Big Three go under, then it could be any time that your business starts making layoffs as well and you don't understand why.  Then once they go to the unemployment offices, they still wonder why there are so many people already there and they can't find a job.    <br>  <br>  It almost would be better to see GM fall under bankruptcy to find out how to structure the business more efficiently.  But then again, we go back to the issue of all the lost jobs, not only with them, but also dealers, suppliers, Chrysler, and Ford.  <br>  <br>  This is a quote from Mitch Albom that I really like ~ "We hear South Carolina senator Jim DeMint tell NPR that "the barnacles of unionism" must be destroyed at GM, Ford and Chrysler. Barnacles? Barnacles are parasites without a conscience. Sounds more like politicians to us."|`|dPpOgny9aa	ok,if GM  closes down not only is there 224,000 people there but you forgot about all of the other people that support gm with parts,transportation,etc.and those 224,000 have at least 2-4 people in each house hold,plus everyone else that is effected,so by the time you add up everyone involved with just gm your over 1-3 million people if not more.so its not just GM  that will be hurting,and also if GM is gone which vehicle company will supply the people in washington with limo's right now its caddy's hauling there butts around,could you see the pres.in a mini cooper and the secret service guys trying to protect him in that,or what about the hurst,when the vip's pass,again caddy there too.so now what retro fit a toyota for runner,ya right.so we need gm more than people think gm owns 7-9 different auto makes,the most in the world,GM  is the largest auto maker in the world if they go under than the world goes under 1929 all over,but worst this time.so think about every thing before you come to conclusion on just one auto maker...there is more than just the employees at GM.|`|f60f9dd363f9ce088c134896470f9277aa	I think they need to re-invent the wheel for this recession. let them have the advantages of a bankruptcy and a loan to restructure. They are important and employ alot of americans but the union has them by the walnuts and won't let go. Time to shake the dead wieght and get some fresh minds in charge. Anyone that asks for a loan of that magnitude with a jumbo jet in their garage should be strung up. period. We also need to seperate them from the big oil men if they aren't one in the same.|`|3rFqFKi0aa	On paper that sounds good but as someone in the industry I can tell you that if they "go out of business" it will cost much more than that.  Yes there are only about 200k employees, but there are millions of retirees which still are on a pension plan.  That alone is worth over 50 billion, not taking in future costs.  <br>  <br>  Here is the kicker:  IF GM were to go out many more people would lose there jobs.  Suppliers would go bankrupted, advertisers, restaurants near would go away.  It's been projected that over 3 million would lose their jobs if GM went out.  Not to mention if GM ceases to be it will take down other auto companies including Chrysler and Ford... and its very possible companies with extra capacity and high investment could be hurt as well including the likes of Toyota and VW.<br>  <br>  Just know this.  If GM goes so does the standard of living in this country, and I promise you the price of vehicles will double in a matter of a couple of years if this happens.<br>  <br>  Also take some time and learn the difference between bankruptcies: chapter 11 and 7.  I took the assumption you mean 7.
