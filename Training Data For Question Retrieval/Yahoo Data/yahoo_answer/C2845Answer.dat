pbV7dnKKaa	There are a lot fo different type of bars you can work at like sports bars and lounges, they are all different and the business changes depending on where they are located. Whittier Blvd seems to have a lot of bars on it like Calif Tiki Club or Memos Place. Just look at an online yellow pages to filter out what type of place you would work at then go from there : >
AdSc1Vbiaa	wutsup, TO here as well. so yea, they dont have the McDeals anymore, so you may have to get a couple of double cheesburgers (1.39) or jr, chickens. Best deal is at BK, they still have the value meals, and there set up the same was as McD was. tuesday is chicken<br>  wednesday is the best because its whopper<br>  thursday is a bigmac wannabe-king supreme<br>  friday is fish<br>  saturday-double cheesburger|`|47HLcvqAaa	In Toronto they don't have fillet o fish they have replaced it with moose burgers.|`|ym8jbkogaa	I don't think McDonald's have daily specials anymore. They replaced it with the $1.39 Extra Value Menu. It's like that where I live (western Canada). I'm assuming it's the same for all McDonald's in Canada.
wBzuC5pmaa	They serve deli sandwiches not pb&j so that'd be silly. If you want a pb&j go home and make it lol. They have turkey, cheese, lettuce and deli food not pb&j.|`|mIj958p1aa	well it's a marketing campaign and it isn't meant to be taken literally about everything. they don't have peanutbutter or jelly at subway so they would unfortunately have to say no and appologize or they might say no and laugh at you.|`|0a5e3ca6e627a0f07f1948ce4430d13eaa	y would somebody be dumb and do that|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Sorry, for all those who think they actually have that on hand, they don't.  Funny question, but I'm sure it would still be a $5 foot long and that's a lot for a PB&J.<br>  <br>  Also depends on the IQ of the person behind the counter.  Where I worked, they would laugh, but where I live now, they would probably look for the peanutbutter.|`|n2GzyCm2aa	If Subway can't make a peanut butter sandwich,try Burger King.They say you can have it your way at Burger King.|`|8ZARrsnXaa	well they'll just say no to just you cause they don't.|`|Turzzw3Qaa	We'd say something along the lines of "Sorry, sir/ma'am, we don't have that here.

There are a number of different options listed on the board" (point to the board with the sandwich options)|`|vxz91VBfaa	haha that would be funny and they will make you a peanut butter and jelly sandwich lol. Who knows they might have a secret stash back in the back room lol.

pbV7dnKKaa	If you look at an online yellow pages you can find all sorts of bars in Riverside! The only karaoke bar that I see is Joe's Bar & Grill on Magnolia Ave but its worth trying out and seeing if it is a good atmosphere! See if there are karaoke bars in any cities near Riverside too!|`|QONP634Kaa	pick up a magazine like LA weekly or OC weekly.  there are lots of clubs/bars and things to do in there.  Im sure they have a version for the Riverside area.
PxJXJKCpaa	Sorry, but I reported your first answer.  That FISH's website makes my computer crash and it doesn't belong here.<br>  <br>  I don't like "Green Lite" as it sounds like KMarts' blue light special.  How about "Burgers and More"?  Roadkill Cafe? (I actually ate at one once) A1 Steak House, BYOB (build your own burgers),  Mom's place, <br>  <br>  Ran out of ideas.  Here are some used names.  Texas Land and Cattle, Texas Roadhouse, Fuddruckers (byob)<br>  <br>  Got a beer and refreshed the brain.  Heffers, Hooves, Grain and Cattle, The Feed Sack...naw, Chisholm Trail, Angus' Steak House, Bullshit's, ...naw.<br>  <br>  Look up Texas and do some history research.  Might help out.  I would suggest a side of grilled shrimp with your steaks, choice of sauces (not A1) but like mushroom/wine, creamy garlic, and others.  Also have salads and portabella burgers for those non protein eaters.<br>  <br>  Good luck and Bon Apitito!|`|YnNhr3eIaa	That should have been part of your business plan!|`|BI6iR0wjaa	Dining with my brothers!!|`|bGMWpAjAaa	why not "BROTHER's GRILL" as simply yet fun to hear steak house...=D

JfVxCDb7aa	It's good food, I worked at one and I loved their whopper and chicken sandwichs...........|`|AA11684189	If you think you're addicted just be careful that you wean yourself off slowly|`|ixyNeBhWaa	Its all in your mind.<br>  You tell your mind to remind you of a time you feel good and stimulated through some part of your senses.<br>  When this happens and you are then hungry, your mind triggers the thought process that you wish to experience in order to full fill this satisfaction.  Your mind doesn't know if its good or bad, it just computes.  Its your body that will give you signs as to whether it is good or not when you get sick.  So if you know you have been eating it too much and you know you want to stop, then stop.  Replace the hunger stimulation with something else.  Find a completely different taste for lets say...   a vegtable they you like.  Try spinach, asparagus, carrots, or nuts, fruits sandwiches. If you are over eating..  then replace that wanting to feel good feeling with a hobby, like everytime you want to eat..  play a video game.  That will turn things around.|`|AA10706358	man have you checked the food.. as in had it lab tested :P<br>  I don't think you can get addicted to food itself.. you need to wash it out of your system.. eat only vegetables and fruits for a couple of days.. specially those rich in cellulose like apples..|`|NTEuxMVmaa	if you win the bet ,you can use the money for more burger king food|`|IPFCtyvQaa	you need to ask yourself "is $33 more important or, my helth/well being"|`|3XaREbrQaa	In all honesty, there have been tests done proving that people can become addicted to fast food like they would be to drugs drugs. It's a weird concept, but entirely possible. I would assume, though, that you shouldn't be too addicted to it after only one week.... But as far as stopping, it is only 33 dollars that you would have to pay him, compared to the about 100 you will spend eating there everyday for every meal for a week. Personally, I would back off and just pay him the 33. but thats me. oh and you won't have withdrawals from Burger King for 5 months. thats just the typical for high-addiction-level drugs (aka Schedule I drugs such as heroin).|`|bTmDVdc8aa	Not worth it.

YXUjNFDJaa	Anywhere on the strip are $25 and over per person, and are usually the best. However, places like The Feast inside Station Casinos are usually about $7 and are pretty darn good. I think of all the cheaper buffets, Sams Town is my favorite. Pretty good food with lots of variety.|`|3TQCwtxJaa	The Wynn, Rio, and Bellagio are the best and can run you almost $40 a person. The Sahara is the cheapest on the strip at $8.99 per person. The Mirage is roughly $25 per person, as is Treasue Island. <br>  Off the strip, Station Casino's run between $12.99 and $16.99 for dinner. Breakfast and lunch are cheaper. My favorite off the strip is the Silverton which is $20 per person on Fridays and Saturdays (less the rest of the week) but I think their food is delicious.<br>  <br>  As far as the best, all I can say is you get what you pay for. The Rio, however, is known to be the best is Las Vegas.|`|8VrlRUfhaa	Sahara: $8.95<br>  They go up from there<br>  Best; Very subjective<br>  Sam's Town is very good and value priced.|`|ybdb5lZGaa	hands down the best buffet is THE WYNN its a newer casino near fashion show mall its kinda expensive around 36 bucks but i promise you wont be sorry! also MGM is good and around 20 bucks.. and CIRCUS CIRCUS is really good and its affordable because its geared more torward families..

2Ypig4jBaa	The Crows Nest has comedy nights on Sunday and live music during the rest of the week.  I agree with Shakoj that the Shadow brook is nice.  The tram down the hill is quaint.  Gildas and the Ideal Fish company down by the Boardwalk and wharf.  This could lead to a nice walk on West Cliff, watch the surfers, or if the Boardwalk is open you can play a round of miniature golf.<br>  I would recommend the Crepe Place.  Ask for outdoor seating by the fountain.  There are savory crepes for vegetarians and omnivores.  And delicious sweet desserts to shared.|`|pbV7dnKKaa	Why dont you drive him into San Jose and go to a comedy club! You can get dinner, drinks, and watch a good show.

1545062c5c87be5a56f1f287fcc4e2c2aa	I used to work at McDonalds , You just have to ask for a big mac without sauce and lettuce and they will cook it fresh, not all big macs are cooked to order , they hold a few for maximum of 10mins in a heated shelf behind the counter.(you can see it)<br>  <br>  Its not mayonaise on a big mac , its special big mac sauce , i hate mayo but big mac sauce is actually nice ): And for all those people who say theyre allergic to gerkins , theres gerkins in big macs sauce haha!|`|12heIlHDaa	well first of all bigmacs dont come with mayo its just "2 all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onion, on a bun" none of the burgers are premade yes the meat is but only by about 5 minutes or so.

Mcdonalds cannot refuse to give you a burger with some items missing, I know loads of people who hate pickles so ask for none and get none. <br>  <br>  I can't see why they would spit in your burger because you're making it easier to make, If you asked for loads of different stuff or asked for your pickle to be diced instead of sliced they would probably spit in it lol.|`|3Sr2FgRfaa	I special order all the time at MickyD's because I have a picky autistic kid. They'll do whatever you want, cheerfully, but it will take just a little longer. Rabbit food on a Big Mac is not just lettuce, but also chopped onions; it has no mayo, but rather special sauce.

I think that's right!|`|uUGB5zyRaa	Big macs dont ahve mayo on them its tastes like 1000 island dressing.<br>  <br>  But yea they will make your burger any way you like, just order in the lobby so you can watch them make your food, I always do.|`|Fk7GG3eUaa	yes, actually you can.

SO you may get your burger without mayo and lettuce.  but you may get some special sauce.|`|ayTSz4Rvaa	yas you can ask for the lettuce and mayonaise off as its made freash there and then! my sister worked in 1 before and she only gave what the customer wanted. plus she never spit into any order!|`|dUwl7Gn0aa	yeps just ask them i have friends who ask for plain cheeseburgers etc..... but i never ask i just scrape off what i dont like incase they do spit on it lol|`|1giK9hUhaa	You can get your burger anyway you like it.|`|2XRU0duUaa	Yes you can. my dad does it so they make it fresh!|`|xn3tfD7Waa	Wow! brilliant Question!!!!|`|AheiBds6aa	just tell them you dont want mayo or lettuce........wheres the problem?|`|t5NJHzBgaa	I've never had a Big Mac with mayo on it|`|8OeOsNhpaa	for sure|`|Q5lcOPkZaa	yea u can just ask for no lettuuce and no mayo,|`|P2zbIXztaa	yeah mate i order mine plain then put in some fries and bbq saunce taste is unbelievable|`|JfVxCDb7aa	they CAN special make them, but only if they are fluent in english and have the time., otherwise they sit in their heat bins (during rush hour)|`|ZuQUU50Gaa	yes you can|`|G6t2O9Kmaa	They actually cook the burger when you order it. They do not heat it up. If you want to customise the recipe you need to go to Burger King, McDonalds don't let you miss ingrediants out.|`|2b0f81fb7bceab4ca7447b2b2061c7dbaa	No, you can ask them for a bigMac without the vomit or rabbit food, but make sure you're not in a hurry.<br>  They have to take the time to custom make your burger for you.|`|U3qTwOOIaa	LOL they won't force it down you.  Just say a big mac without the cr*p|`|3047dd6618622823b544c55daf1b8a58aa	Yes, just ask!
