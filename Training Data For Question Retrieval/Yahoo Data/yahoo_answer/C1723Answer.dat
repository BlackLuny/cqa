3qLIRorjaa	No, it will only be a loss to her family and friends.<br>  <br>  She'll be forgotten about shortly after her death. People just love drama and that's why so many people are interested in her now.|`|mno4Qd5paa	When she’s pronounced dead? When we see her crying children placing flowers on their dead mother’s grave?<br>  <br>  No. Sad as it seems, sad for the haters, even more than the hated — who will by then be in a place where they can no longer touch her — the rivers of loathing which pour down upon the broken body of this young, naive, defenceless young mother, born into massive poverty and underprivilege, with everything stacked against her, seem unlikely to end with her death.<br>  <br>  <br>  And when they realise this, I hope for the sake of both their souls and their sanity that the haters seek help for their own condition — which would seem to eat away at any decency or sympathy they once possessed as surely as Jade’s cancer has eaten away at her body.<br>  <br>  She will be dead — but they will still be terminally sick.<br>  <br>  The internet is a great invention but it is also one of the biggest playgrounds of the cowardly bully since the arenas where the Romans threw Christians to the lions.|`|n2eOdOm8aa	This is a woman’s life, or more properly death, we are talking about, of course; this fact has not escaped me. For the bovine middle-class hacks on the broadsheets, Jade Goody is something to berate the rest of us about, for our tastelessness and callousness — but, nonetheless, still, even for them, a form of entertainment. Isn’t it awful? We created this woman and now we have tired of her! Except, of course, we haven’t tired of her, and we didn’t create her. We will watch until the final moments, or some of us will.<br>  <br>  Almost everything about the Jade Goody business reminds us, one way or another, how gross we are and how perpetually close to the end. That, I suppose, is the compulsion. From her desperation for the sort of affirmation and lifestyle afforded by popular acclaim, regardless of its provenance, to the terrifying rapidity with which her illness — feared by all of us.|`|AA12050428	I didn't know who she was until recent weeks but took a look at part of BB from which she sprang, courtesy of my computer and could not believe the vulgarity contained in the programme. Not only from JG but other women on the show were unbelievably uncouth. This is what is called entertainment in Britain?<br>  Will she be missed? Well the media will miss her for a while, until they latch on to some other unfortunate nobody. Her family and all these 'fans' who get so upset if anyone voices an opinion about her, will be heartbroken.|`|f3894cf56c171c2df84b7a30010ead74aa	It will be sad and heartbreaking just as anyone death will be.<br>  <br>  Why should someone who wrote a great book be celebrated more than someone who say served on an atlantic convoy during the war?<br>  <br>  I don't think any one life is more worthy than another, except for people who live bad lives and hurt others.<br>  <br>  Sadly when Jade dies I will say a prayer, switch off the TV and hide from the annoying circus which will demand we all grieve for her.|`|wnyuH0aTaa	Chavs everywhere will hold a minutes silence when she snuffs it. No one else will notice.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry I'm not more sympathetic but I'm a complete bastard to be honest.|`|UYmRjCY9aa	not to society as a whole of course not, to loved ones yes|`|lkNJNnlSaa	Yeah i agree with you and Teddy.|`|jfOSVSQkaa	Only to her immediate family, not to the society.|`|ga6J9TYFaa	No it is a loss to her friends and family, especially her little boys who will have to grow up without a mother.|`|TzPofCDxaa	To family and friends, yes.<br>  <br>  To anyone who does not know her, no.|`|kvm9MWdZaa	To society not at all but to the gutter press yes and of course her family.|`|a6j7Bu9daa	to society nope just one less talentless moron<br>  to the family of course|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	only to scammy newspapers and shitty hello|`|ebee988c7e88e57112c395fec80ac354aa	While you are free to ask what you like, don't you feel this is in bad taste?|`|WvtMU3Lsaa	not arsed,about that racist,who is now trying to be a saint.|`|662b9ab7e4aca1ed74e57891a663eccfaa	not one bit|`|wmBK9uASaa	Not even slightly a loss|`|AA11015890	No, it won't be a loss to society.  I'm sure her fans will miss seeing her and reading about her but, as you say, the real loss will be to her family and friends.|`|R534McNOaa	Who's to say she wouldn't of gone on to do something great, even now, the word is that many more women have booked to have cervical cancer checks due to the Jade Goody publicity (early treatment may save someone), and everyone is precious in God's eye's, bless her.|`|xU7AaQOdaa	In the overall scheme of things, no.<br>  <br>  To the Media, yes.|`|0gNlwcaVaa	Of course it is a loss, she  is a human being|`|PwHQSAxvaa	I am far more concerned about my aunt who passed away this Friday.
fSdSuMHOaa	Here in India, the law is still 'when the lights come on, you better be home'...the good thing is that the parents enforce that law, not the state.  Its time that certain families went back in time to good, sound, old fashioned family values.|`|ESKslyfsaa	There are some slack parents out there, I have a 16 yr old son who only goes out if he has somewhere to go.  The problem is parents who can't be bothered with bringing up their children, parenting programmes won't work, you can't teach someone to give a s*it.  Cheaper activities for these youngsters might work but I don't think that's where the problem lies.  So how do you make adults become responsible parents, maybe take away their cigarette and beer money.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	Zero tolerance is too strict. It's not the children's fault. The parents need to be responsible for them. Why aren't parents being more responsible for their children? What is happening? Is it because of work demands or is it because of laziness/can't be bothered?<br>  <br>  Tax the parents more then for additional children's programs. No free rides.|`|GOpQsYHUaa	Any action to improve things is positive, so I welcome these programmes.<br>  <br>  I am beginning to think that all humans should have a knot tied in it impeding them from reproducing until they can prove that they have got what it takes to raise a decent human being.|`|kvm9MWdZaa	It is the parents who need zero tolerance........our children are just an extension of ourselves, I listen to my daughter and it is me I hear speaking.  Deal with the parents and the children will come good|`|khnMoQNoaa	make parents responsible for their children's actions<br>  so if a child up to the age of 18 commits a crime the parent goes to prison <br>  simple as that|`|AA10874030	I think there needs to be a combination of both to be honest - tougher penalties for parents and more activities for children.<br>  <br>  I agree with you about parenting classes - surely it is common sense? Sense that the parents probably posses somewhere but cannot be bothered to put it no place. I think these programmes will change nothing. What needs to happen are are stricter penalties for these parent. For example, they could threaten to take away benefits or council housing if the parent does not put into place a curfew or do something to get that child off the streets. <br>  <br>  I think alot of it is boredom. I live in a town where a lot of young people hang about outside the shops etc in the evening. They look so bored and I can't help but think if there was a youth club or under 18s disco or something they could go to this would really help the problem.|`|f5wTQblsaa	I am disgusted at the number of children who accompany their parents to pubs and licenced restaurants. Thursday last our meal was ruined by children running amok in a local diner. It was 10.30pm, I know it was half term and they had no school the following day  but these children appeared to be only 8/10 year olds. If the parents allow this behaviour in their presence what does it encourage them to do when unsupervised.<br>  We really do need to get back to old fashioned family values, teaching our children respect for themselves, others and the community as a whole. We seem to have LOST a generation somewhere|`|xcdHd7G0aa	I was walking home after dark last week and couldn't believe the amount of young children who were roaming the streets, some as young as about 6. It's the parents responsibility to look after their children and know where they are, especially when they are so young. Yes it would be good for councils to provide more activities for children, especially during half term, but ultimately it's down to the parents to look after their kids.|`|5ede303e3f09ef934bb1a71e8b13e26aaa	Yeah, the parents need to take the blame for these kids.  I'm not sure about providing activities for kids though.  There was nothing like that when I was a kid and I didn't wander the streets drinking and stuff.  I stayed at home with my parents and/or my friends because my parents were pretty chilled out and let my friends come round and watch films and stuff|`|X8wrtDE7aa	parents these days seem to be trying to move responsibility onto everyone else- society, the schools, the police, social services. it is time for the law ( police , social services and the courts) to make it clear that until your child is at least 16 you, as a parent, are responsible for the child's actions. i am aware that you can't be with them 24-7 but you must make them understand right and wrong , and be sure they will behave when you're not around. some discipline and the regular use of the word 'NO' at home from an early age may also help|`|f8KFSKqAaa	As parents,  i am one to 3 children who i have for the most part single handedly raised; two of which are now teenagers are never allowed to just roam the streets without purpose.  They in fact do not roam the streets at all.  I know where they are and who they are with at all times.  I drop them off and pick them up, i chat with the parents of where they're going to be to find out just a little more about whats on the agenda for the day / evening.  These poor children that are left to just roam and get into all sorts of god knows what are the product of lazy, irresponsible and selfish parents.  I feel as parents we have an obligation to set rules and boundaries of what the majority of society believes to be acceptable.  Sadly, these parents do not set any and as result have socially challenged children.  Rules and boundaries for these children are non existent!<br>  <br>  I don't think that parenting programs will help these people because you have to care first and they, clearly, for the most part do not.  That involves time, commitment and dedication, unfortunately, they only have that for themselves and then wonder why when little Johnny fronts the courts, what did i do wrong?  A lot of these children and their parents too have little understanding of consequences, because there aren't any, they, both the children and the parents get off far too lightly.  Our police are powerless to a certain extent, the courts have a softly softly approach and it becomes a vicious circle.|`|FO1XCZc4aa	The best was to help the youth's of today is to sort their parents out. I was in Belfast last week and couldn't believe it when at 1am I saw boys about ages with my 9 year old wandering around the streets. I have to stop and tell them I thought they were too wee to be out......I was relieved when they walked on as so many will turn around and give you grief for caring.|`|AA11015890	It's atrocious and I cannot understand what these idiotic, sorry excuses for parents are thinking.  My kids would always have been at home after dark until they were teenagers.  Even then, I always knew who they were with and they were never allowed to just hang around the streets.<br>  <br>  I think too many parents these days are selfish individuals who prefer to have a kid-free Friday night and just enjoy the fact that their youngsters are out of their hair.  It's desperately sad, but it should also amount to criminal negligence and result in both legal action and some kind of support and advice on parenting.|`|AA12349988	I agree that an 11 year old should not be out and about after 8pm drinking or not.<br>  <br>  But the report didn't say how many where 11 and how many where 15 or 16.<br>  <br>  Where are 15 and 16 year olds supposed to go at 8pm on a Friday night?  Parenting programmes will not work the council needs to come up with real alternatives for kids and the 1980's version of a disco no longer appeals.  Where time and money has been invested their has been a drop in anti social behaviour.|`|hsyI1DxDaa	Kids just aren't bad in the night, some are downright idiots in the daytime (same with the parents.). Around where my brother lives are TONS of council houses, and I ******* hate going through there. Kids at the age of AT LEAST 6 are on the roads (literally on them), some swear at you as you pass by, I think I've even seen some even smoking.<br>  <br>  What the hell's going on?|`|MNja3iwMaa	Yes..

If anyone should be put off by the comparison, it’s the monkeys.|`|RLQpyK3Jaa	In poor taste, especially in New York City (5 boroughs in unison) where White cops feel it's okay and get away with murdering Blacks, who have been called "monkey."  I think it was directed at President Obama specifically (his stimulus bill) and Blacks in general (White cops standing over a dead monkey, representing a Black person).<br>  <br>     That's how I see it because I live here in New York. Nothing but True Talk.|`|07527bc8468917a254c01d461144bd4faa	I think it is comparing the authors of the stimulus package to the chimp that went berserk recently.|`|77cb033374598e8c10938763c9fe03f7aa	It is a sorry situation when people can make some thing out of a cartoon.|`|IEuat3Goaa	When you look more at the editorial cartoon, it says WRITE, nor SIGN. Obama did not write the bill. If it had said sign, it would be a different story. People are taking things out of context. While African Americans may take this into offense saying it is Obama, it is only the society placing these kinds of ideas because a lot of racism occurs.<br>  <br>  The monkey could represent anyone in Congress during the making of the stimulus bill. NO one knows what it has to do with besides the artist. The monkey also could have been used because of the recent chimp attack.<br>  <br>  People jump to conclusions without even seeing any other side of the story.|`|ovSkTNCoaa	It was in bad taste, but, it wasn't about President Obama. He didn't write the "stimulus" bill, so how could it be about him? My opinion is that it's just race baiters trying to stir up trouble.

AA11875616	Casey Anthony is not egocentric, in the normal sense of the word.  Egocentric basically means that a person believes that they are more important, or smarter, or prettier, etc, than the others around them.  Narcissistic, which is a more accurate description for Casey Anthony, is the world view that no one else exists, only you and your needs.  All those forms walking around, talking, eating, asking questions, are to you just furniture to meet your needs.  You only interact with them to get what you want, like you would interact with a vending machine to get what you want.  Look up the word "Narcissism" and you will find out much more to complete your paper.

The Democratic Congress ignored him, Franks & Dodd claimed the economy was sound. Bill Clinton made it MANDATORY that banks supply mortgages to people that could not afford a home (a plan developed by Jimmy Carter). You should be reminded that the economy was ok until September 2008, ironic isn't it that the elections were in November?! Obama was elected on "Hope & Change", now he is using fear and strong-arm tactics to get his way for a new Welfare State. When his new taxes take affect on April 1, look out!|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	B B B B B But, I thought we were voting for change!<br>  <br>  We didn't complain when Clinton left a $5 trillion plus, debt.<br>  <br>  That was only a piddlin amount though.<br>  <br>  Then we doubled that.  Now what?<br>  <br>  I would have complained when G Washington left a $75,000 debt.<br>  <br>  That was more than one could earn in a lifetime.  If one worked for 75 years one could earn about 1/3 that much, @ $1.00 per day.<br>  <br>  I guess one good debt deserves another, huh?<br>  <br>  I won't be here to pay it off, but I've already paid my share during my career.  Sorry, you will.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Maybe China will file bankruptcy and our debt will be forgiven.|`|NMpbLtuTaa	You haven't done a full comparison between the two Presidents.

d882dfb556981cb3af4f55a8e9b82fbfaa	War is actually fighting or fighting escalated into war. If we can stop the fighting initially then war is not necessary or there is no war. War is chosen when talks failed and a show of might is necessary to reduce the rival`s arrogance or to force them to talk.|`|dGiYVfw6aa	War is necessary sometimes. When the Nazis and the Japanese were conquering countries and murdering millions of people along the way it was necessary for someone to try to stop them. Can you imagine what the world would be like today if no one stopped them?|`|AA11994859	It is totally NOT necessary.<br>  <br>  War happens most often because governments do not agree on each others stance. This means people suffer the causalities of the war. If the governments engage in meaningful dialogue most of the conflicts can be solved.<br>  <br>  Sometimes war happens one one body bullies and forcefully takes undue advantage of a weaker body. In this case the weaker body has no option but to try and defend itself. This type of war can be avoided also by forming strong ties with other bodies in the region so that the bullying body does not dare to attack.|`|HFQNk75Xaa	i've never heard anyone logically explain why war isn't necessary. The more logical argument is based on where war falls in the line of viable options ... <br>  <br>  too often military muscle is flexed as a first option ... and that's a huge issue in the world ... nobody likes to be forced into acting ...|`|gjHgJd78aa	I think war is necessary, but I have an idea. <br>  <br>  People dislike bloodshed...don't want to die...War causes irreversible damage to the environment and wastes resources...|`|zBB2AFMbaa	It is necessary. whoever thinks differently is very naive
f3894cf56c171c2df84b7a30010ead74aa	I think others are right Stormy, it's not Political Correctness, but firm clamping down in the hope of getting out of redundancy payments.<br>  <br>  My Niece works at a call centre which is closing in the next few months, and since the announcement the management are enforcing the rule book, i.e. people being sacked for having mobile phones at work despite no one being disciplined since the place opened.|`|AA10889612	Certainly over reaction but that is the PC brigade getting it wrong again. Unless jokes are really offensive I see no harm, as in life we have to put up with friendly jibes otherwise life would become intolerable. Anyway jokes at the expense of the Irish, English & Scottish have  been around for ever it would seem. I have to say though that not many have been banded around poking fun at the Welsh. Perhaps this call centre is in Wales.|`|f5wTQblsaa	They were probably suspended for illegal use of company time and equipment.  As an ex. manager we were always told to be on the look out for breaches in contracts therefore giving the opportunity to cut staff without paying huge amounts of redundancy.<br>  Take heed|`|GOpQsYHUaa	Rather than for the joke itself, maybe they have been suspended for wasting their time e-mailing when they should be attending to other things.|`|fSdSuMHOaa	i think its sad that a country loses its sense of humour, especially a country like yours thats known for her zany & fantastic sense of wit.|`|hsyI1DxDaa	Not only was that joke not remotely offensive but it wasn't even funny! Why suspend over that!?|`|376a0b518236d45e27355ee9bd22da43aa	yes i would suspend anyone who thought them jokes where worth passing on|`|009b0bbe5bd2538efdd1143c1bc82b19aa	knowing BT they are probably oh sorry, i've already bored myself<br>  <br>  i am soooo glad to have left BT yaaaaay!|`|UAW1U3Uoaa	Well in these politically correct times it could be that someone in Management felt the joke was offensive enough, however most companies also have an Internet and Email policy which prohibits personal use and sending of non business communication apart from wasting time there are also other implications such as the risk of spreading viruses etc. Im sure the policy will have been included in their contracts and they should have known the potential consequences.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	I don't think this is a reaction of the 'PC brigade' and more of BT wanting to get rid of staff without having pay out anything in redundancy payments.  They suspend staff without pay for a while and then see who will jump ship.  They will make the excuse of the fact that staff were wasting time sending emails when they should have been working, but these are emails they will have been sending to each other day in day out at work and no one would have batted an eyelash|`|TDVIb4SBaa	Over reacting ? of course they are ,we are getting to the stage we wil have to stay silent in case we offend someone, PC has gone mad totally  mad,am keeping my ears open for any jokes,malicious comments anything against Scotland on the media and am going to sue sue sue!!!<br>  Wish they would hurry up need some extra cash|`|xcdHd7G0aa	It's a huge overreaction and is probably nothing more than an attempt to be seen as politically correct. I wonder how many of those people who were suspended were of Irish heritage? My dad is Irish and I know he wouldn't find this joke offencive as he's e-mailed me many similar jokes before now.|`|KpDfWlxVaa	Im Irish used to work for BT. I read this joke a while back and found it very funny us Irish can laugh at ourselves. I think BT are being ridiculous to suspend staff about this it's about time they lightened up.|`|kvm9MWdZaa	I thought the joke was quite funny and I am sure that much more malicious things have gone unpunished in the past but we are all supposed to be much more pc these days......shame|`|FO1XCZc4aa	It is quite  funny I thought. It is more likely messing about while working that was the misconduct part than the content of the joke and like the article said, an easy way to get rid of staff without pay.|`|AA11015890	That's a really funny joke!  I'm part Irish and I'm not offended by it.<br>  <br>  I think people have seen right through BT on this one; it's almost certainly a cheap way of offloading staff.|`|NMpbLtuTaa	I believe in freedom of speech but on the other hand if there is too much of that going on at work and it is interfering with production, then a correction will have to be made.<br>  If the bosses are doing a lot of chatting about nothing, they have no moral right to correct people who are doing the same.<br>  I don't like or tell ethnic jokes and it isn't because I am afraid of the "thought police". As a matter of fact I am certain that the "thought police" are out to silence me. (My experience on Yahoo! Answers and elsewhere is a small part of the evidence of that.) <br>  Actually, I don't know why I don't like them; I suppose it is an outcome of my Christian walk. On the other hand, I am not at all hard on people who do tell ethnic jokes and simply turn the other cheek or look the other way.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  I wouldn't be surprised if the people involved knew they would be caught and knew what the consequences would be but did it anyway because call centres are among the most "Big Brother" dominated and oppressive places on earth!|`|AA12349988	The problem with these kind of 'jokes' is that Irish people have been accused of being thick in them.  Irish people not being able to work out the difference between BUNGEE Jumping and BUDGIE Jumping etc<br>  <br>  Ha ha ha fcuking hilarious<br>  <br>  By allowing these jokes you are starting to make the assumption that Irish people are thick.  <br>  <br>  As someone who is Irish I take exception to these jokes as it sets the perception that I am not as clever as my English co-workers so therefore I dont need to be paid as much - or when a promotion comes up I am not good enough for the job.<br>  <br>  That is how racism works - it doesn't have to be directed with hatred. Why do you think Coke spend billions getting their product on shows like American Idol - or RBS spend billions on sponsoring the Rugby.    They are not saying how good their products are just showing them and letting you make up your minds because it works and so does racism.|`|U3qTwOOIaa	think of it this way.  These days the word 'racist' is over used at the slightest thing.  They probably have it in their working contracts that this sort of email is not allowed.  Also they are meant to be working not messing around.  I think they have done it to 'prove a point'|`|b1eacc63c481ff40082f035f83d011d1aa	Budgie = BUNGEE<br>  Parrot = PARAchute<br>  hen = HANG-gliding
QydVDaXRaa	What a disgusting way to treat an eleven-year-old boy.  I don't care what he's accused of; a civilised country should not isolate its children in 8x10 cells.<br>  <br>  Edit:  for those that are adding comments to the effect "lock him up and throw away the key", please read the question again.  The boy is *accused* of murder.  He has not stood trial and has not been convicted.  Innocent until proven guilty.|`|MLLCn4weaa	Why is the poor boy in an adult centre in the first place? That's just sick.  Obviously the child is disturbed to have done what he did and I don't know the circumstances.  But it can never be right or humane to keep a child in those conditions.  Shame on those who can't see that.|`|4AbXxowTaa	Execute the bastard.  He's old enough to know better by 11, and if he's capable of cold blooded killing now, there's no telling what he would do as an adult if, God forbid, he is released.|`|rUsFKFQ8aa	ridiculous! let him mingle he committed an adult crime, let him pay the adult consequences!|`|3qa3BftUaa	He planned it and is old enough to understand the consequences. His age is an excuse. Lock him up and throw away the key|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	the boy cannot be tried as an adult therefore he should be detained as a juvenile|`|jfOSVSQkaa	Should be moved to juvenile.|`|Wb1ydezNaa	he committed a horrific crime and no matter jail/juvenile,locked up somewhere|`|URZeQfQCaa	It's beyond ridiculous. Even if a child gets prosecuted as an adult, they should be recognised as vulnerable when placed in an adult institution. This kid should be in juvenile.|`|dsUDIUlHaa	juvey, why isn't he there now|`|AA12235828	Oh Dan in Miami - pulease!  He's a child.  He had no idea what he was doing.  You can't treat him as an adult because he isn't one!  Yes, unless there is reason to believe he's en route to becoming a serial killer he should be moved to a juvenile detention center.  What an horrific situation for everyone concerned.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Wanda - I have a 14yr old, a 10yr old and a 9yr old - I've got a rough idea about children.  I'm also a foster carer for children who've had very disturbed upbringings.  I can assure you treating an 11yr old as an adult will only bring about more trouble :-(|`|avhgLEu8aa	No, he should remain in jail like anyone else. Irrespective of what age he might be.|`|FO1XCZc4aa	He needs to be moved regardless of the crime...he is a walking target for child abusers in an adult prison and I can see why he is isolated. As someone else said, he cannot be tried as an adult so it makes no sense for him it to be placed in an adult prison and must bring ridiculous costs into it for maintaining him in one. He has that right to be protected from harm despite the horror of his actions :)|`|AA10283080	He should be in a detention center but with the same security as a jail.<br>  <br>  If he's only 11 and murdered someone on purpose he is surely capable of other monstrosities. If he committed an adult crime he should pay the adult time.<br>  <br>  Len. You obviously don't know any 11 year old children. He knew what he was doing. He just didn't know the consequences.|`|AA11015890	This child should be held in an age-appropriate centre.  It's outrageous that he's being charged as a adult in the first place, but why are they now subjecting him to such actrocious care?  I know he committed a terrible act, but he's just a child and there must be laws on taking care of his wellbeing?|`|3iJ6CmAjaa	He should be moved to a juvenille detention centre. Leaving him in a cell like that is going to turn him into more of a criminal, not less. Prison is no place for an 11 year old boy, how ever bad crime he has comitted.|`|prqrQcd1aa	He's going to be moved to juvenile detention center probally tomorrow!

Nah, better to leave things the way nature intended, I think for me anyways.|`|xcdHd7G0aa	Not me, I think it would be pretty lonely coming back to life when everyone and everything you knew before has gone.

He could well line himself up to be a robot in the future...I would hire him and gets my cats to sing.....he would be calling them world class performers as I will have programmed him to do it.......it wouldn't be the same though.<br>  Cloning fascinates me as physically it can be done but mentally, never as the spirit is free|`|HCvJ0AGnaa	lol i wonder if he'll be frozen with his high waisted trousers on? Maybe in 2000 years time, when he's thawed he'll be a fashion icon to the generation...ummm maybe not!<br>  <br>  As for me, well only if I could be 1000% sure this works, and if my whole family could be frozen as well. i'd hate to wake up in a world where I knew no one and my family were long gone!|`|AA11015890	Trust Simon Cowell to want to do that!<br>  <br>  With my body the way it is now, there's no way in hell I want to be lumbered with it all over again in a hundred years or so!|`|NMpbLtuTaa	Absolutely not.

SczwOzzFaa	For starters you have to be 18 to vote as if turning 18 suddenly makes you any more qualified to pick our government leaders than a person who turns 18 a few days after Election Day. You have to be 18 to purchase and smoke cigarettes as if because your 18 they're less harmful to you. You have to be 21 to purchase and consume alcohol as if it makes a difference on the effects it has on you . You have to be 18 or even 21 to work at some jobs that are deemed hazardous and dangerous as if being 18 makes the job any more safe.

You could be charged with manslaughter but if you have no record and it was self defence, you may not even get gaol at all, it may be what they call a suspended sentence where you are charged with manslaughter and sentenced to 5 years suspended sentence, which basically means you will get off any gaol term but will have a record.<br>  <br>  You should really have legal representation and advice before you even think about confessing to anyone. Go make an appiontment with legal aid. There is client confidentiality between you and the lawyer so that cannot be forced to reveal anything. Just make sure that you and your friend corroberate each other's stories and that you are both telling the truth. You need to have a good memory if you lie. Always remember that. Better to be upfront. You are only a kid and were probably very scared and just went in to defence mode for your own safety and your friend who was unable to defend themselves.

qBGcU465aa	when you die it is then you are reborn into a better life , only God can do that|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Well, it's possible to restart a heart that's stopped beating, so maybe one day it'll be possible to get a "dead" brain responding again?<br>  <br>  There's nothing "magical" about the human body after all - it's just a collection of cells and substances, evolved over millions of years. The only limitation we have is the current extent of our scientific knowledge.<br>  <br>  One thing that would concern me, though, is that if you die as an old man of 90 and get frozen, you'd be brought back to life as a decrepit old man of 90, and would probably die again pretty shortly afterwards. They'd probably have to find a way of reversing the aging process too, so that wrinkly old Simon can return to his buff 49 year old current self, or even to his teenage years, once they've defrosted him.|`|eXbgLXgCaa	the problem is not the brain..its the soul inside the body... once left the body,noway back! you can apply the same to animals,the result is the same.. once dead will be no response whatsoever. if you freeze something while still alive,you may one day get a result..but once is dead,that's it I am afraid..because you are freezing something dead and in return you are unfreezing something dead !|`|Fx1CMFlNaa	i know its stupid nobody cant be brough back to life, the soul leaves your body when you die and its not exactly going to jump back in when your defrosted he wants to see the future he'll have to go through reincarnation|`|cp30vrVoaa	The short answer is: No.<br>  <br>  The long answer has been debated over and over in the courts of law. <br>  <br>  At the end of the day it's still No.|`|BEqAhXBlaa	the brain is just electrical signals so if we could work out how to start them firing again on paper we could bring someone back to life|`|f5wTQblsaa	We are talking about Simon Cowell here - he would have to have to a brain first|`|uW1ZlA2Haa	Let me see , let me see .<br>  Umm... interesting <br>  I'm not a Dr. but I did sleep at a Holiday Inn last night : )|`|Rx4wdfMbaa	The website owner of Digital PCTV has made claim to dying each night to awaken born and alive again.So,it appears possible i suppose....Strange...Hope this helps..|`|avhgLEu8aa	No idea, the guy's an idiot.|`|mI2iwx7naa	i've no idea, and i don't count cuz i'm already brain dead :)|`|Klp0Mv6kaa	Oh,it′s very simple.You invite the prophet Muhamma.he comes with a piece of yellow cow′s meat,strikes the dead with this meat-and the dead immediately stands up(I think that after that he runs away as fast and as far as he can,not be hit with the stinky piece of meat again).|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	Well we can't.

Lx6TXgHKaa	No.<br>  It keeps you in good humor and allows you to be more productive at work.|`|mjE08gVNaa	It can all add up if you think about it-it's a form of theft|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	It can be. However, if the question allows them to work at a faster pace, be happier andd more attentive at their job, and is approved by their employer it can be a beautiful thing.<br>  The question remains...which are you?|`|xdUjRxKzaa	I wonder how many of those who use their company time on here would do it if they owned the company? Or would they feel happy about their employees doing it? That's  a NO, NO. It's not strictly theft but it certainly is an abuse of the employers trust and quite frankly i would have suspended and probably sacked any member of staff caught doing that in my business, abuse of trust leads to abuse of other things too and makes that member of staff untrustworthy.|`|NMpbLtuTaa	It depends on what kind of deal they have with their employers. The employer at my last job (I have a new one) allowed us to use our own laptops to surf the Internet with during slow times. The company even supplied the password for the wireless connection.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	Most jobs have quiet times, slow times etc.<br>  if you pop onto FB or something while you have 20 Min's to spare its not theft.<br>  if on the other hand you spend time online when you should be working and short change your company with shoddy work then that IS theft.|`|kMK9E2a7aa	It's not theft, it's neglect!|`|f5wTQblsaa	It is a type of theft, you are being paid to work for your employer and while you are on here you are not working. It's the same with nipping out for a quick smoke, it is all in company time, I once had to do a project on how much time is wasted by misuse of company property, the result was for every 8 hours worked 1hr 9mins was stolen|`|mNzgWFkGaa	wow very good point there!   If i was employing someone and found out they where on here instead of doing the work that i was paying them to do, i think i would hit the roof!  so yes in a way i suppose you could call it theft.  Actually I've known 2 people  (different jobs ) who where fired for using the internet and personal e-mails on the company time well they couldn't actually complain about being fired.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	Technically - yes but if they have done all that they can do and have nothing else to do - no. It's a gray area. This kind of thing keeps my morale up. I was pretty depressed and was getting sick at the idea of coming to work and not having enough work to do. It's common knowledge. Everyone is in the same situation. Management knows. I continue to do well and get raises. I'm resourceful and here more often than not. I'm positive. Before this, I was going downhill because I was bored and depressed. I can do so much more. <br>  <br>  I used to work at a place where we were so busy. I loved it. The distance and cost of living prevented me from keeping the job. We couldn't afford to move closer. The commute was killing me - over an hour each way with ridiculous traffic. I worked very hard so I was tired. I worked more than 9 hours a day - intense work - loved it but I'm human. You do what you have to do. <br>  <br>  It's not a black and white world.|`|X3PmWPUraa	And how many times have I worked through my lunch time, come in a bit early or stayed late - with no extra pay.  The workplace is supposed to be an adult environment with give and take on both sides.  If my employer was difficult about me answering a few questions in a slack time, I would be very difficult about doing unpaid hours!!!  He gets his money worth - any extra is a bonus.|`|Kp8ijsmOaa	No not theft , Skiving.<br>  <br>  Skiving is allowed & no I dont think it  is hyprocrisy to complain about the JSA spongers at anytime of day. There are plenty of them & if you want to moan about it, go ahead. Personally I don't care about them, they gotta eat so they have to have our tax money.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	No, it's not theft.<br>  <br>  It may be against their terms of employment, or may not be.<br>  <br>  Yes, it is the height of hypocrisy. Get back to work you slackers!<br>  <br>  Have to go now, Deal or No Deal is on in a bit.|`|hpzfccwaaa	It has more to do with "how much employer thinks he/she is entitled to for the hourly wage of work" It is like a master and slave mentality. while employed who do we think we are and where do we think we are.|`|AA12279950	Oh god.  That's my bonus gone for a burton.  Again ...|`|UAW1U3Uoaa	No it is not theft, it may be against the terms of employment depending on the terms of the contract relating to Internet and Email use. No I don't think spending a little time on the internet during quiet times or when there is nothing else to do makes someone the same as unemployed people who are too lazy to get a job.|`|15e75cc83e026da5def65e0733f69023aa	Yes...you are stealing work time...|`|GR0G3uYbaa	Hope not, other wise i'm a thief!!!!

SYU4JIohaa	Yes, I think they are over reacting.  Children pick up fears from their parents, and if a parent acts like a person with a lower limb missing isn't "normal" then the children will feel the same.<br>  <br>  Parents should be teaching their children about acceptance, and I would have thought this would have provided the ideal opportunity.<br>  <br>  This is why ignorance's are passed from generation to generation.|`|KDNWFuZWaa	It's more likely that it is the parents who are scared, not the children.  I have heard it said many a time that kids can be cruel, however they are also very understanding and accepting of people with different disabilities in my experience anyway.<br>  If this woman is doing her job properly then that should be enough, without all this idiocy.|`|FOUCV6Cmaa	I think they are overreacting!  You cant hide a disabled person forever.  That would be like going to the mall and asking every person to leave that don't "look just right!"  I would hope this would leave an area for parents to explain to their children that just because the person don't look like them, does not mean they are scary or not human.|`|1XiTBn28aa	I have to agree with many people is saying that the parents are definitely overacting. This poor lady must feel so humiliated. she DIDN'T ask for that disability did she? she was just unlucky. These parents wouldn't like it if people were scared of them for a reason either. They should teach their kids to accept people in society.|`|zjuMrDmGaa	I agree that the parents should use this as a chance to discuss disabilities with their children. Their reactions are reflecting their OWN prejudices, which, of course, they are passing on to their kids.<br>  <br>  My daughters had a one armed teacher in elementary school...she wore a prosthetic and would take it off for her students that were curious....most children are just that, curious, not scared.|`|9n5vvwlpaa	They aren't just over reacting but they are giving thier children bad behaviour pattern. The life isn't like in the fairy tales. Parents should learn their children to understand others. This show how ignorant they are!|`|O5KOwhovaa	Yes, they are overreacting.<br>  <br>  By their logic, if their children were scared of black people, then black people would have to be banned from children's TV.<br>  <br>  Disabled people exist. You cannot hide your children from that reality.|`|hxTOG1dZaa	Yes they are,disability fact of life the children are bound to ask questions. All the parent has to do is to answer it.|`|GR0G3uYbaa	Then parents should be reassuring their children that being disabled is not something to be scared of|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	It's an absolutely terrifying indictment of sh  society we have turned into. One wonders would these parents have supported the Hitler master race idea. Anyone born with mental or physical imperfections goes to the gas chambers. If a one armed presenter frightens their children then they have not educated their children in a fit manner. You are absolutely correct.|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	How could anyone be scared by her? She's a pretty lady. Kids might be interested in it. I think these parents want a lesson in parenting if their kids are really being scared by her.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	I think those parents are wrong.<br>  Do they think little people, their special needs classmates, and people in wheelchairs will scare their kids, too??<br>  <br>  <br>  I think the parents are the ones who are a little uncomfortable because they aren't used to seeing people without an arm, especially on television.  They are projecting their awkward feelings onto their children and then amplifying them with respect to their ages.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think it would be far better to let the kids watch the show--- they may not even notice!!  This will help to expose them to the diversity that exists in the human race and will teach them that, though someone looks different, they are really the same as the rest of us and there is nothing weird or scary about them.<br>  <br>  <br>  If parents, though don't want to let their kids watch the show, that is their business.  If the show is able to keep the ratings, then it should stay on the air.  A few close-minded parents shouldn't be able to get rid of it.|`|0AlwfTxMaa	Wow, instead of using this circumstance as a positive life lesson, the parents are in fact "enabling" their children to grow up and be discriminatory, or judgemental about people with disabilities.|`|GOifC7i3aa	yes<br>  <br>  they should be ashamed of their stupid prejudice ...and imagine blaming the kids for their intolerance?|`|aXnVFFUkaa	yes i agree, the prejudice the kids will show when they are older will have come from the parents|`|b8tgCAQJaa	These parents are incredibly stupid and should not have been allowed to breed. <br>  <br>  I mean, instead of reassuring and explaining things to the child, they actually AGREE with the child that the woman is scary and campaign for the BBC to take the scary lady off TV!<br>  <br>  It's no different to the parents who wanted to shut down a disabled people's swimming session at the local pool because they were "scaring the children".<br>  <br>  My cousin, when she was little, was apparently scared when she saw black people on TV - this was, of course, because she lived in a totally white area and had never seen a black person in real life before. By the same logic, should the BBC have taken all its black presenters off the air? Or should her mum have just explained to her that some people have different coloured skin, which is what she did do?<br>  <br>  And how would these parents feel if one of their own children was born without a hand. Would they want them put to death, like in Nazi Germany?|`|uKrdjrJiaa	Most reasonable parents would be glad of the opportunity to expose their children in an easily accessible way to people with disabilities.I think that the Small number of parents who complained should look deeply into themselves and ask if they really are so perfect.In my opinion a nasty spiteful bigoted nature is far more of a disability that someone with one arm!|`|RvddYKqjaa	You fear only what you don't understand. I pray they allow the woman to stay on the air. This is the perfect time to sit down and talk to a child. They don't realize you can lose part of your body to an accident or birth defect. They have to learn that even a simple kid accident can cause an amputation sometimes. Hiding the facts from them just creates more unnatural interest and fear.|`|fSdSuMHOaa	Over reacting is an understatement. Those parents have lost it. Children are more compassionate & wiser than we give them credit for. i've taken mine to an orphanage since he was 3years...hes seen it all...even a little child his age with no arms & legs...just a little torso. They take turns racing on his wheelchair...children get beyond what is considered 'normal' & 'abnormal' much faster than such silly parents & focus on what matters most...the person within.|`|xJWZTwFVaa	Yes, yes and yes they are over reacting, same as trying to accept black people as normal (sorry if that sounded racist) the children don't notice the difference until you tell them. <br>  The parents should get a life|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	Those parents and their children have got to be some of the worlds most paranoid i mean my GOD  what if the lady had been Black or Brown also.|`|ESKslyfsaa	Those parents are pathetic.|`|kpcJNDtLaa	Its not as if the whole arms missing, she's got a stump.

Some people have an experience that seems to wake them up. They review their life and realize that they can see the patterns and attitudes that have created the situation they are in.

You are grilled and you don't give just a pint of blood when you donate.  You give a little more in seperate capsules so they can test your blood for HIV and other drugs and diseases.  Of course you would know that if you had donated blood in the past.  If tainted blood is being passed around then it is deliberate and someone would be in jail by now.  Also consider that those of us who do donate do not get paid and are being asked to donate as regularly as possible because we have a shortage here in the US.  What ever problem they are having in the UK is because of them not us.  The US could not sell the blood without someone squealing.

ksOW8Y4Aaa	No, the chances of North Korea attacking the USA are basically zero. The last time another nation attacked the USA was in 1941, now that we have thousands of modern accurate nuclear weapons no nation dares attack us.<br>  <br>  Yes, it is true they have some fifties era missiles. A few fifties era missiles are no threat to the USA. We managed to survive a nuclear armed Stalin and Mao, North Korea is peanuts compared to them.<br>  <br>  It's unlikely North Korea will attack any country, their rockets are a deterrent force, not a first strike force.<br>  <br>  No, we don't have to do anything to "protect" ourselves since this is a trivial threat in the greater scheme of things. And, frankly, since we are already spending more money than the rest f the planet combined on "defence," we're the most "protected" nation in history. And yet somehow our government wants us to worry about every little threat on the horizon so that we OK throwing ever more buckets of money into "protecting" ourselves.<br>  <br>  If we really want to protect ourselves, we need to elect honest politicians who will run the country for the benefit of the people, not as a cash cow for  the military and the arms industry.|`|4IVWMgp7aa	Has anyone ever stopped to ask WHY they would attack?

Seriously, we probably have 100 missiles for every one they've got.  <br>  Where are you getting this?  Fox News?  Fear-mongering is how they stay in business.<br>  Edit:  If it's aimed at Alaska, it would take out Sarah Palin.  See, there's always an upside.|`|09409387b5e563591bca040cbb27b777aa	No they're are not,  as the US. is the only one who will bail them out of the hole that they put themselves in.

The childdren are raised to these criminal activities of murder and terror, so it is generations of belief that such destruction is perfectly fine and normal. Hamas strategically locates itself in communities, hiding amongst children and women so that they won't get caught. It is very sad. I can;t think of any humane way to end the fighting unless one side or another is completely relocated.  Even then, the teachings will continue because it is mixed with fanatical religious belief.  The best thing that can happen is that money is no longer being poured into the middle east for their oil and drug crops.

Like thinking people should learn to speak goddamn English before they hop the border.  Or thinking that blacks are all gangsters or rappers.  Lumping people together helps humans expect what might happen.  It's just one of those little mental feats of 'triumph' we have come up with to deal with our multiraciall world.<br>  The truth is, white people are racist, but other races are MORE racist against white people!

Though really I think a great many non-white people are victims of racially motivated attacks too.<br>  <br>  It seems that your single preoccupation in life is stirring a big pot of muck of your own making.<br>  <br>  edit. a quote from the wikipedia page. "Initially, two men were arrested in connection with the crime. One man, Daanish Zahid, was found guilty of Kriss Donald's murder on 18 November 2004 and is the first person to be convicted of racially motivated murder in Scotland."<br>  <br>  I take it I get the thumbs down for having evidence contrary to your narrow view of the world.
AA12349988	The fact that he was able to move around the world so freely suggest he wasn't as much of a victim as he cliamed to be.<br>  <br>  I would certainly look at deporting him when he gets back here.|`|YXGdwwTJaa	I cannot understand why the British government is getting involved in the case of the refugee seeker from Ethiopia.  I had been under the impression that only British nationals were the concern of the government.  This man had, according to the media, gone to see the Taliban in action after converting to Islam while in Britain.  His arrest followed being in possession of one, or more, false passports. I agree that I am surprised that he had the money to buy plane tickets, and I did not realise that asylum seekers had papers which let them travel outside the country.  <br>  <br>  What he was doing in a place where fighting was going on, when he was fleeing persecution for some reason, does not make much sense.  Anyone who has been traumatised and, I imagine, anyone who has been threatened  personally by their government, would be unlikely to be brave enough to go abroad alone, let alone visit a war torn country, a place most would avoid as being too dangerous.  <br>  <br>  There is a good organisation in Britain which gives medical help to those who have been tortured or ill treated. Those who have been scared still keep a low profile and do not go looking for trouble as they need to recover and that takes a long, long time. <br>  <br>  I know no more about this person than what was written in the papers.  Britain does fulful its duty in giving help to those who are personally persecuted by their governments, or the close relatives of those who are targets. What surprises me is that some still do go to places that are not entirely secure, or back to their homeland, for visits.|`|RQxZSvFwaa	Funny you would never ask this question if he went there to fight the soviets? <br>  <br>  What do you know?

MYXgZ2M5aa	Note that someone has accused him of being an illegal immigrant. In fact, he was granted temporary residence to study engineering. As his charges were dropped, why can't he do a 'Jade' and sell his eight years in captivity to all and sundry, as being accused of 'terrorism', in a country as confused as England is now, he will find it hard to find work. If the British public can feel a weird sense of helping Ms. Goody, a woman who has had most of the world judging Britons (you, me and your mother) on account of what she got up to in her years of 'joy' - and who didn't do a great deal, then we should also stand up and question the authorities. Before that also is taken from us - and judging from some of your answers, it looks like some have lost their rights and intelligent to question the people who decided to make Mr. Muhammed 'enemy number one', mainly the US and UK.

And no I don't think it's too late at all, if anything she should be, and IS getting more now than ever. <br>  <br>  I can almost guarantee what she made on BB was mostly taken by agents, or spent by now - afterall that was quite a few years ago now!

I'm sorry for the girl and the people who love her, (that's rapidly reducing by the hour actually) but honestly this whole affair is a farce.  Whatever happened to dying with dignity!  And at the end of the day, she's not the only human being to be dying from this dreadful disease, people who are in far worst situations than this girl.<br>  <br>  As I've said before, if she raises public awareness, and saves the life of just one young girl, that's one thing.

It was a comment she made in jest in an interview. She said something like. I have lived life in front of the camera, I'll probably die on it too. It was a Joke. She can with all her problems still manage  a sense of humour, which is more than can be said about the majority of people these days. Everyone seems to have taken it literally and is going on about it, and slagging her off. I wish people would listen and not speculate.<br>  <br>  Also the last Living TV programme Jade did that was aired last thursday was about how she has been coping with the illness. Nothing has been filmed since she found out on 13 February that the cancer had spread. She has not been on film since then. Jack was interviewed about this on last weeks programme not Jade. The only thing that has been filmed since is her wedding.|`|AA12262106	I haven't read that she plans to die on National TV.<br>     I think it's admirable of her to be concerned about her kids' future wellbeing when she's so close to her deathbed.<br>     I don't think it's any of your business what she may or may not have done with the money she had earned previously.The fact is that the financial needs of two youngsters is astronomical especially when you won't be around to offer further help at a later date.<br>     Broadcasting her illness not only allows her to provide for her children in the future, it also has a positive effect in that people are more mindful of getting screened and improving their chances of survival because of the early detection.<br>     Your lack of compassion for her plight is astonishing, and I highly doubt that you'd see things in the same light if you were terminally ill.|`|713d09d4e24b6e6ced1f1de7fff7fc4aaa	I can understand her trying to ensure her kids have a good life but she is now pushing the boundaries too far and folk will become bored with hearing of her problems.  There are so many people who are in a similar situation without the chance of making money for their families that it must be heartbreaking for them.     She had made her millions prior to cancer rearing its head so there must be money somewhere unless she spent every last penny?

Not only will it provide for her children but it is subject we like to pretend only happens to others and yet it happens to us all (dying).<br>  I don't understand why we get so moral about seeing such things on TV, we see movies all the time in which several people are killed in horrible ways and yet seeing someone die for real is morally reprehensible?<br>  Death is a part of life for everyone and we need to be in touch with the emotions is stirs in order to know how deal with our losses, quite apart from which Jade will be showing us the real horror of cancer, we need to be aware of things instead of pretending they don't exist if we ignore them. Why pretend it doesn't happen and why assume she is just doing this out of self interest? We don't know all her motives for making this choice and are assuming we do.<br>  Also, who said she had lost all her previous money? I hadn't heard that before? I know her earnings took a big hit after the failure of some business ventures and the Shilpa Shetty issue but I never heard she had gone bankrupt. This is probably the most important TV venture she has ever considered and maybe doing so will also give her a record of her life for her children and some inner peace, I wouldn't want to deny her that or call her mad for making that decision.

Sympathy for her family, friends and herself.<br>  <br>  What do I think about the PR campaign for HER? Nothing but disgust. First, what dignity is there in turning the most private times and situation into a circus show. Second, she should have used her 'fame" to launch a PR campaign about cervical cancer, its sufferers, charities etc, but no she turned it into something solely egotistical. She has apparently found religion, so why advertise it, religion in the last days is between the person and god. Also I do not believe the situation in which she found out she had cancer, it stinks of a stunt. You really believe something as private as test results would just be handed out live on TV, just like that, without her consent or awareness of the results? Come on people.<br>  <br>   Look at Martin Kemp, he had a brain tumour — since 1990 — that caused epilepsy which was controlled via medication. He became a  patron of The Encephalitis Society, which deals with those things, and on his inauguration confirmed that he had a tumour. He has used his fame to help  other sufferers, the medical world, and charities, thats what you called dignity. He did not turn it into the Steve Kemp show.|`|A1r0Loxsaa	Jade Goody or now Jade Tweed has terminal cancer.  What ever way she wishes to spend her last weeks on earth is entirely her choice.

Was he not too young to die?  was he not brave and an inspiration??<br>  <br>  I am sad that Jade has Cancer but I am more saddened for those people out of the limelight and their families that will not have the benefits of being a "celebrity".

And that Max G is the biggest culprit in all of this.  So is he doing it all for nothing?  I sincerely doubt it.<br>  <br>  As long as it raises awareness and saves the life of just one young girl, that's a plus, but otherwise, sorry, I for one am not going to be sucked into the mass hysteria that's apparently going on.<br>  <br>  There are hundreds of poor people dying every week from cancer, each one a tragedy on it's own but these poor souls manage to deal with their personal death with dignity which is, it would seem, sadly missing here.|`|GR0G3uYbaa	Ditto, i think she's great, and wouldn't any mother do what she can for her kids, some people are just jealous, she never got a penny for all the negative publicity she's received, the papers and magazine have made enough money from her since she's left big brother.|`|5Mfu8lEVaa	I guess.

vXpqLvNuaa	Write the headline. It should be brief, clear and to the point: an ultra-compact version of the press release’s key point.<br>  <br>  <br>  News release headlines should have a "grabber" to attract readers, i.e., journalists, just as a newspaper headline is meant to grab readers. It may describe the latest achievement of an organization, a recent newsworthy event, a new product or service. For example, "XYZ Co. enters strategic partnership with ABC Co. in India & United States." <br>  Headlines are written in bold and are typically larger than the press release text. Conventional press release headlines are present-tense and exclude "a" and "the" as well as forms of the verb "to be" in certain contexts. <br>  The first word in the press release headline should be capitalized, as should all proper nouns. Most headline words appear in lower-case letters, although adding a stylized "small caps" style can create a more graphically news-attractive look and feel. Do not capitalize every word. <br>  The simplest method to arrive at the press release headline is to extract the most important keywords from your press release. Now from these keywords, try to frame a logical and attention-getting statement. Using keywords will give you better visibility in search engines, and it will be simpler for journalists and readers to get the idea of the press release content. <br>  Write the press release body copy. The press release should be written as you want it to appear in a news story.<br>  <br>  <br>  Start with the date and city in which the press release is originated. The city may be omitted if it will be confusing, for example if the release is written in New York about events in the company's Chicago division. <br>  The lead, or first sentence, should grab the reader and say concisely what is happening. The next 1-2 sentences then expand upon the lead. <br>  The press release body copy should be compact. Avoid using very long sentences and paragraphs. Avoid repetition and over use of fancy language and jargon. <br>  A first paragraph (two to three sentences) must actually sum up the press release and the further content must elaborate it. In a fast-paced world, neither journalists nor other readers would read the entire press release if the start of the article didn't generate interest. <br>  Deal with actual facts - events, products, services, people, targets, goals, plans, projects. Try to provide maximum use of concrete facts. A simple method for writing an effective press release is to make a list of following things: <br>  Communicate the 5 Ws and the H. Who, what, when, where, why, and how. Then consider the points below if pertinent.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  What is the actual news? <br>  Why this is news? <br>  The people, products, items, dates and other things related with the news. <br>  The purpose behind the news. <br>  Your company - the source of this news. <br>  Now from the points gathered, try to construct paragraphs and assemble them sequentially: The headline > the summary or introduction of the news > event or achievements > product > people > again the concluding summary > the company. <br>  The length of a press release should be no more than three pages. If you are sending a hard copy, text should be double-spaced. <br>  The more newsworthy you make the press release copy, the better the chances of it being selected by a journalist or reporting. Find out what "newsworthy" means to a given market and use it to hook the editor or reporter. <br>  Include information about the company. When a journalist picks up your press release for a story, he/she would logically have to mention the company in the news article. Journalists can then get the company information from this section.<br>  <br>  <br>  The title for this section should be - About XYZ_COMPANY <br>  After the title, use a paragraph or two to describe your company with 5/6 lines each. The text must describe your company, its core business and the business policy. Many businesses already have a professionally written brochures, presentations, business plans, etc. - that introductory text can be put here. <br>  At the end of this section, point to your website. The link should be the exact and complete URL without any embedding so that, even if this page is printed, the link will be printed as it is. For example: <a href="http://www.your_company_website.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.your_company_website.com.</a> Companies which maintain a separate media page on their websites must point to that URL here. A media page typically has contact information and press kits. <br>  Tie it together. Provide some extra information links that support your press release. <br>  Add contact information. If your press release is really newsworthy, journalists would surely like more information or would like to interview key people associated with it.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you are comfortable with the idea of letting your key people being directly contacted by media, you can provide their contact details on the press release page itself. For example, in case of some innovation, you can provide the contact information of your engineering or research team for the media

RQfLKOPQaa	It's illegal because whales were gradually being driven to extinction. Whalers are Mostly Japanese now, but a lot of other countries have done whaling when it was allowed. I think that if it's tightly controlled it can be allowed to be done by very few people a couple of times a year. Also I think that it should be heavily taxed, to prevent making it a profitable business. I'm not against it because it a centuries old tradition for some people, and I value human life more than whale life, and I wouldn't do anything to constrain that, even at the expense of an animals death. On the other hand it can't be profitable, because if it is, they will be driven to extinction, and a few years from now, the tradition will be lost just the same, and this time forever. Let's not forget that, although whaling was done for centuries and the animals still survived, at that time we didn't have the technical resources to track those animals by satellite, and to kill them the way we do now. So I'm for moderation, keep the tradition alive, but don't let it be profitable, so it doesn't get out of hand.|`|Fo1Gm4Xnaa	There is no doubt that whaling isn't good for whales, and such nations has Iceland, Japan and Inuit people living in the polar regions of North America.

In my opinion eliminating the IRS would be one of first things I would do by changing taxes from our current system to the Fair Tax.

Instead you have to be insulting and pathetic.<br>  And if your so fed up about it why post yet another flipping question about Jade???<br>  The only nasty piece of work I'm seeing here is you|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Not yet, maybe after a few weeks.|`|FP49kXBsaa	I think you will find that nails are no longer used in coffins, and even if they were you might be getting yours nailed down before Jade|`|doLyOac0aa	She's made her money now for her boys future, so i think she should spend what time she has left with them, and her new hubby.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	the questions on this subject get a bit boring day after day dont you think|`|9kTejB0uaa	I wouldn't go quite that far - but I do think it's time to LEAVE IT ALONE.

505oVIRyaa	Don't do it! Seriously. I'm not joking. I am in college. I'm about to graduate with a journalism minor and it won't do jack **** for me. DON'T GO INTO JOURNALISM. It's dying. I love it, and I love writing, but it's just not worth it right now. Maybe it'll come back one day, but right now, there are no jobs and certainly no money. Newspapers are rapidly starting to go out of business, big newspapers that we all assumed would always be around.
