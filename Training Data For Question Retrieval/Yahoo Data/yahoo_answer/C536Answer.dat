Even your finger will do the trick.

OKPFeBtYaa	They would be much cheaper if legal, but subject to taxation.  I think legalizing drugs would be the single most beneficial things politicians can do.  If you have $5, you can buy enough bourbon to kill yourself by alcohol poisoning, or wrecking your car and taking innocent people out with you.  <br>  Marijuana can be grown anywhere and would be cheap, but again, heavily taxed.<br>  Heroin and Cocaine are also not difficult to grow, but require the right type of climate, so again, pretty cheap.   The reason they are so expensive now is that coke changes hands many times between Colombia and NYC, everyone marks up prices, and the risk of violence and or incarceration makes salaries higher, than say, if you were importing bowling balls to America.  Heroin also travels thousands of miles and is expensive for similar reasons.  <br>  I would think legally grown cocaine would cost anywhere from 10-15 cents a gram.  On the streets, it costs $30-$100 a gram.  The government would add taxes to it, and also artificially raise the price to discourage people from using it, though.  So, maybe, like $25 or $30 a gram.

0TT5q0cUaa	The simplest and the most basic principle is to reduce food intake, especially the fat content, and increasing physical activity. Increasing physical activity alone is not an easy way to lose weight unless one combines it with a reduction of fat intake. Physical activity includes walking, jogging, swimming, cycling, aerobics or any other household activity such as cleaning, washing, climbing stairs etc. The sense of well-being and weight loss motivates an individual to make changes in his or her diet as well. The best way of keeping a good control on ones dietary intake is to keep a daily diary, and writing down whatever one eats as one eats. Avoid high oil content in the curries and do not use butter on chappatis, which may be tasty without the fat. The doctor or health care provider evaluates the daily diet and plans a diet providing calories enough to maintain the weight below the ideal body weight.<br>   <br>  Increase your physical; activity and reduce the intake of food. Your initial goal of weight loss therapy should be to reduce the bodyweight by 10% from baseline. With success, further weight loss can be attempted. Weight loss should be 1-2 kg for 6 months. Reducing dietary fat alone without reducing calories is not sufficient for weight loss. Reducing dietary fat along with dietary carbohydrates can help reduce calories. Weight maintenance program should be priory after 6 months.<br>  <br>  In order to maintain one’s weight, calories consumed should be equal to calories used. Energy balance is like a scale. When calories consumed are more than calories used, it results in weight gain. Let physical activity tip the scale in your favour. You can perform aerobic exercises 30 minutes a day thrice/week. Avoid a sedentary lifestyle.<br>   <br>  Certain medicines are also available for weight reduction. There are two main types of weight reducing drugs: one class decreases appetite while the other prevents dietary fat from being absorbed by the body. These drugs should be taken only with doctor's advice, as there are a lot of side effects related with their use. Surgery to cure obesity should be undertaken as the last resort for people who are very obese, have tried all the other options available and have medical problems. The main surgical option is to have your stomach banded or stapled so that it cannot accommodate more food. Why not eat less voluntarily?|`|DMpVSHvXaa	1. Eat less.<br>  2. Eat less junk.<br>  3. Exercise.|`|F9Ll7oLJaa	do kapalbhati pranayam as suggetsed by baba Ramdev in Aastha|`|X9QOHRLFaa	well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info.

You have to show patience. Please remember learning to eat well and exercise is the only solution to long-term weight loss.<br>  2) The 2nd important thing is that your body weight is controlled by the number of calories you eat and the number of calories you use each day. So, if you consume fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight. You can do this by becoming more physically active or by eating less. <br>  3) The 3rd important thing is never skip ur meal or go to a crash diet. Don’t ever try to starve urself. It is very important to understand that when you skip a meal or go on a crash diet, the result is that it slows your metabolism to conserve your energy. And when you lose weight too quickly for a few days, your body thinks it is threatened with starvation and goes into survival mode. It fights to conserve your fat stores. There fore keep in mind never try to skip ur meal, especially breakfast and always try to take food on time <br>  4) Before starting any type of diet, weight yourself and note ur whole body measurement in a dairy. Then after every week weigh your self again and compare with earlier measurements and see how much weight u r losing. Record a goal that you can reach in one month that is 4 to 8 pounds less than you weigh now. Set a goal you know you can achieve.<br>  Now some tips how to set ur diet plan.<br>  5) Start taking your food with out any oil. Try to use boiled/steamed vegetables, meat, and lot of salad. U can eat fresh and raw fruits, boiled/steamed chicken or red meat too but no pork. Please note and put it in ur mind that nothing fried or oily.<br>  6) No Junk Food, Potato & Sugar Please. <br>  7) Drink at least 3 ltr of water daily. Make ur habit to drink water as much as u can. In this way you are not only flushing out toxins, you are also teaching your body that it no longer needs to store water. When you feel starving, drink it as much as u can. Pls remember water is a natural appetite suppressant. <br>  8) Make you habit to use brown bread & sugar. Skimmed or low fat milk & yogurt.<br>  9) First try to avoid any type of soft drink but if u want to taste some thing sweet then drink any soft drink (remember use regular one, no diet cola pls) once in a week<br>  10) Make ur habit to eat once a day a vegetable soap or Thai soup (as ur dinner or lunch) But remember no corn flour in it. <br>  11) Just look at your food portion. It is much better to eat several small meals a day (like 5-6 healthy meals a day) than eat either one or two or three huge meal a day. <br>  12)  The most important factor in any weight loss plan is how many calories you consume each day, and eating too few is the most common mistake. Divide ur diet into 5-6 healthy meals a day (1 plate size only)<br>  13) One bowl of oatmeal can be taken as a break fast<br>  14) Smoking & any kind of hard drink is not allowed in this diet.<br>  15) Try to chew ur every food as much as u can, and then swallow it into ur stomach.<br>  16) Watch out ur every drink and every single piece of ur food. Stay away from fatty foods, junk foods, synthetic foods, foods with preservatives and too much carbohydrate. Don’t try to take foods that are made of white flour for example white bread, cakes, pasta etc and food contain sugar such as cookies, ice cream, candy etc.<br>  17) Remember after every 15 days you can take once in a while with a little treat any thing u like. But remember just a small portion. For example one small personal pizza or one small burger or small pastry.<br>  18) Try to adopt some healthy timing. Early to rise and early to bed. No late sittings. <br>  19) People usually want Quick and Easy result, we are all impatient. U have to be patient in terms of ur weight loss and never give up. Always keep in mind that slow and steady win the race.<br>  20) At least take this diet for 3 to 6 months. When u feel that u have achieved ur desired weight then make this is as a Life Style change for ur entire life.  Remember do not focus on just losing weight; try to concentrate on diet plan forever so that u will never have to loose weight again. Occasionally u can take junk food too.<br>  21) You have to keep in mind that above plan is a not a quick thin program. Don’t try to deceive ur body. It will destroy your metabolism and in the future the proportion of gaining weight is much higher and easier than today.<br>  22) Never ever go for any type of Diet pills or any drug which claim that it will reduce the weight quickly. Taking Diet pills will kill u.<br>  23)  Exercise: Rule-of -Thumb: remember the formula for weight loss and that is Diet= 70% Exercise= 30%. So remember exercise is must with every diet plan.. The best indoor exercise machine is tread mill. Run daily on tread mill for 30 mnts ~ one hour as per ur convenient. If you don’t have Tread Mill then best indoor Exercise is skip|`|VQORLGaGaa	shove one end of a straw inside your guts and attach the other end to a vacuum cleaner.|`|PBQA8tJ0aa	forget about excersing no one can be bothered so heres what really works.<br>  <br>  its a diet: eat only non carbohydrates|`|2eLTpNBpaa	Have a good exercise program.|`|EKeXoPM1aa	Are you stupid?
NgtGJWdDaa	Let me clear this one up for you.  Anyone who says girls must use light weights or they build is WRONG.<br>  <br>  As far as muscles go men and women are more or less the same except for size.  Assuming that, women would build from heavy weights.<br>  There is one little thing that women lack to cause muscle growth and that is testosterone.<br>  The one reason men can add muscle mass is because they have testosterone.  Women do have small amounts of testosterone but it's not nearly enough to cause muscle growth.<br>  Even with the testosterone men have to eat enough calories to build muscle.  With all that men still battle.<br>  <br>  So as a women you can and should train the same as men.  Use dumbells or barbells and they can go as heavy as they can manage safely.  All that will happen is that they will tighten and tone their muscle.<br>  Also make sure to eat a healthy, well balance, calorie controlled diet.<br>  <br>  When you train with weights do 3 sets of 8-10 reps.  If you can do more than 10 reps then add more weight.  If you can do less than 8 then use less weight.<br>  Don't be scared to add weight.|`|XK6k2UAIaa	Yes a girl can use dumbbells.

Train 1 hour after eating also for the best results and you will have muscles. :)|`|fI43KljAaa	you can use dumbbells but slightly of different shape|`|zcKSyrqIaa	i think you're supposed to use lighter ones for more reps so you get lean and not bullky.

AA11020187	You’re asking your question in the wrong section and the wrong country.
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|ej9ijnS7aa	Simple eat less and exercise more.

Go onto video jug and type how to do pilates and there are some AMAZING videos. Pilates tone your body and keep you in shape. I wouldnt say eat less because thats hard and its not as simple as that so what i recommend is eat more healthy foods but still in good portions so your not starving yourself and then gradually reduce the portion size. Dont over do it though i recommend pilates 3-5 times a week for 30-60 minits :-) good luck x|`|AA10736671	1) The very first thing u should keep in your mind and that is the extra weight u put on didn’t come in overnight so it is not possible and also unrealistic to take it off quickly. You have to show patience. Please remember learning to eat well and exercise is the only solution to long-term weight loss.<br>  2) The 2nd important thing is that your body weight is controlled by the number of calories you eat and the number of calories you use each day. So, if you consume fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight. You can do this by becoming more physically active or by eating less. <br>  3) The 3rd important thing is never skip ur meal or go to a crash diet. Don’t ever try to starve urself. It is very important to understand that when you skip a meal or go on a crash diet, the result is that it slows your metabolism to conserve your energy. And when you lose weight too quickly for a few days, your body thinks it is threatened with starvation and goes into survival mode. It fights to conserve your fat stores. There fore keep in mind never try to skip ur meal, especially breakfast and always try to take food on time <br>  4) Before starting any type of diet, weight yourself and note ur whole body measurement in a dairy. Then after every week weigh your self again and compare with earlier measurements and see how much weight u r losing. Record a goal that you can reach in one month that is 4 to 8 pounds less than you weigh now. Set a goal you know you can achieve.<br>  Now some tips how to set ur diet plan.<br>  5) Start taking your food with out any oil. Try to use boiled/steamed vegetables, meat, and lot of salad. U can eat fresh and raw fruits, boiled/steamed chicken or red meat too but no pork. Please note and put it in ur mind that nothing fried or oily.<br>  6) No Junk Food, Potato & Sugar Please. <br>  7) Drink at least 3 ltr of water daily. Make ur habit to drink water as much as u can. In this way you are not only flushing out toxins, you are also teaching your body that it no longer needs to store water. When you feel starving, drink it as much as u can. Pls remember water is a natural appetite suppressant. <br>  8) Make you habit to use brown bread & sugar. Skimmed or low fat milk & yogurt.<br>  9) First try to avoid any type of soft drink but if u want to taste some thing sweet then drink any soft drink (remember use regular one, no diet cola pls) once in a week<br>  10) Make ur habit to eat once a day a vegetable soap or Thai soup (as ur dinner or lunch) But remember no corn flour in it. <br>  11) Just look at your food portion. It is much better to eat several small me
uF85M17Daa	Oh gosh, I am exactly the same way. Exactly. The only thing I can think of is it probably means that what you are currently experiencing in life is not making you happy. So maybe think about what you're interested in and try to get really involved in something that matters to you. I don't know if this just makes things worse, but I do a lot of watching on youtube of things I used to watch when I was younger, and sometimes when I'm home I walk down to where I used to go to school and sit for a while on the grounds. It helps me remember the person I used to be and to remember that I am still that person, but in different circumstances. The past is always a source of comfort, because you lived through it already and you're still in one piece. That kind of certainty is impossible for the present--will you make it through unscathed? Remember that what you're living through now will, sooner than you realise, become memories of the past. Envision yourself in the future looking back on the time you're in now, and pretend you've been allowed to transport yourself back to that time. That's what I do sometimes. It doesn't always work, but it helps me get a better perspective sometimes.<br>  And if you stayed in school forever, you'd miss out on everything that school is made to prepare you for, and that would defeat the purpose.

TiW72sAUaa	I know exactly how you feel, I have a 5 year old son who had the same problem. I took him to the dentist 8 times last year to have his tooth looked at, they used the same flouride stuff which fell out by the next day. In the end my son has the tooth removed at the hospital. I feel really angry about this as I have always taken him to the dentist on a regular basis from when he was 6 months old and this is the result. It made me feel like a bad mother. I felt like I had to justify myself.<br>  <br>  I have a friend who takes her son to the same dentist and has had the same problem, he had more teeth removed. <br>  <br>  If your dentist cannot fill the tooth they will refer you to the hospital for further treatment.|`|m7Z6a3NZaa	If your dentist is unable to see your daughter ( I think he should really under the circumstances), try phoning  NHS Direct on 08454647, they might possibly get her referred to someone who can deal with her toothache promptly.Good luck|`|fS9ophX6aa	The tooth has an underlying infection which is why there is pain. It should be removed or at least investigated. Underlying infection could cause further problems. If you go to A&E at a hospital where they have dental surgeons they will probably arrange for removal of the tooth. There is no point filling the tooth at is not an adult tooth. Don't waste time trying to search for an NHS dentist. A hospital should sort it out.|`|Gry7nblAaa	You should see a pediatric dentist and have them remove what they need to and if there is enough tooth left have them put a white colored cap on it to protect it.

And the good news is it doesnt sound like you have it.<br>  Cervical Cancer isn't really something that causes painful symptoms in fact most times you don't even know you have it.<br>  It is a sexually transmitted virus. Many women carry it and have no effect from it. Some will get and abnormal pap smear and this usually means it has started. But the body usually (60-80%) heals itself within a few months to a year later. If it does keep going your cells begin to change. It takes many years for the actual cancer to grow. (usually around 10) So if the cells are changing you have a small operation and regular pap smears. <br>  It shouldn't cause bleeding or painful urination.<br>  I have also suffered from many painful UTI's and it does cause all of your symptoms. if its not a UTI it does sound alot like an infection rather then cervical cancer. Just keep in touch with your doctor and get regular pap smears.<br>  <br>  Good luck. I hope this helps.|`|mNxHFOd4aa	If you've been treated to prevent the onset of cervical cancer and have had normal pap results for the past 7 years there's no need to worry about that. To me it sounds like a really bad infection that you've let go on for too long. Not even close to cervical cancer.<br>  <br>  Calm down and just wait to see what your doctor says during your appointment.<br>  <br>  And just so you know - NEVER self diagnose, especially using the internet. You have no medical training and don't know what exactly to look for so you're only going to work up your nerves looking at the wrong information.
POsgMHhLaa	considering that they are drug addicts they probably spend all their money on drugs, so no money for fresh bongs or needles, never the less i don't think that Hygiene is a great concern when you are high<br>  <br>  sticking a needle into an infected arm and then into yours is a shure disease  spreader<br>  <br>  if one hep C or HIV strand is mixed into your blood it starts multiplying, ensuring that you are infected|`|yONm5l5laa	Basically, the reason for needle exchange programs is because it's the lesser of two evils.  You don't only get HIV from sex, you know. Sharing needles is BAD!!!!  If someone is infected with HIV and you're sharing needles, you run an extremely high risk of becoming infected yourself.  The organizations that provide needle exchanges do so not because they want people to stay addicted, but because if you're going to use, they don't want the HIV virus, AIDS, or like you said, Hep C to become more widely spread.  If you use, and share needles, please please stop.  If you use and know of an organization that does needle exchange, please see them.  Likewise for your friends.  Also, sounds like you could use some education about infectious disease.  They might be able to help you there, as well.|`|xkJZwnHTaa	Some places have exchanges where a user brings in their old needles for new ones to prevent the exchange of such diseases. You may share the drug, but often what happens is when the first person uses, a little of their blood goes into the needle, so the next person injects a little of the other person's blood into theirs.|`|OKZkABDqaa	diseases can be transfered by blood and if you share a needle, its practically like sharing blood, not a good thing
oZgqs7Jvaa	Don't start eating foods with high amounts of high saturated fats and sugars instead eat more healthy foods which contain natural fats. For example, nuts and avocados. Also eat more starchy and carbohydrate foods (potatoes, rice, cereal and pasta). I would also suggest trying to increase your portion size.|`|t20rYTOSaa	Whatever you do to increase your weight don't pig out on KFC or McDonald's because after to long, it can kill you, just eat more foods with more calories, more fat, and more sugar, and then stop exercising, just do this until you are happy with your weight, but don't get addicted to these living styles, good luck.|`|Ey3Bu8e7aa	I wouldn't suggest not exercising; you still need that. You still have to eat the right things, but a lot of those are high in fat. Nuts, ham, and other meats with fat olbiously have a lot of calories. Underweight isnt that bad of a thing (unless you have anorexia) but if you feel that bad about it, try to get a little fiber into your diet.|`|VdERqnYRaa	Play basketball and eat healthy food.Boys grow up until 20years old with right food and sports.|`|vfMesuzeaa	look at this one <a href="http://healthywealthytip.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://healthywealthytip.blogspot.com</a>|`|E64juLwJaa	Eat more meals and bigger helpings:but healthy food:not greasy stuff<br>  Planets.|`|pOi0wewIaa	Eat more
d6Jgwdsbaa	Well preferably do the workouts at night because if you do Pilate's during the day you will be incredibly sore especially after the first day. After your body gets used to the work-out things will get alot easier for you. The above plan looks all right but i would recommend spacing it out. There should be a day or two a week for you body to bounce back from the strenuous workouts that you're doing. It also gives your body time to get back in tune before your next workout. Generally it takes about 2-2 1/2 weeks to begin noticing differences. The workout will become easier and you will notice you don't have to work so hard to complete them. hope this helps.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	I did Pilates exercises to supplement my running a few years back.  I noticed a change in performance after about a month.  There was a huge hill on my running route that always seemed insurmountable before Pilates, and one day I noticed I had gone up without a hint of abdominal or back strain.  My posture also looked better by that time.  <br>  <br>  You might find yourself more flexible at the end of the day for doing Pilates, but it probably doesn't make a difference when you do it as long as it's dong regularly.|`|MfKWHH4Naa	That sounds like a good amount. Remember to eat healthy or the pilates won't help much. You can do it at any time of day. I don't suggest right before bed though.
VerfhAQcaa	I take Geodon for my bipolar disorder. It is also prescribed for schizophrenia too. There is no sign of signifigant weight gain. I have been on this medicine for 2 years now and i have actually lost a little bit of weight. This medicine is good because the company that makes the medicine, phizer, has a connection to care program if you are low income so you get your medicine for free from the company. thats what I do. Go to www.geodon.com and check it out. I think it will be good for you. I take 80mg twice a day, i think thats the highest dose you can take. <br>  <br>  Hope all works out for you!|`|bxxwhP04aa	Wellbutrin helps many people with depression, and has a side effect of weight loss.|`|AA10889282	Wellbutrin doesnt cause weight gain...sometimes weight loss|`|rHqe7oMoaa	The only one's I have experience with are prozac and Cymbalta. I did not have any weight gain on the prozac, but I'm currently on Cymbalta 60mg dose and I have a LOT of weight gain (10 kilos/22lbs in 1 month). I do not recommend Cymbalta because it has some other nasty side effects.
2d0610771e587e3c29c621430f179a35aa	no, situps will tone and strengthen. A cardio workout and diet is what will trim your stomach. If you do situps without a good cardio and diet it will actually look like your stomach is getting bigger as the muscle builds below the fat.|`|zfrPmiFtaa	Nope, they just build muscle there. But I think that the muscle will help you lose the weight too. I'm not sure though.|`|sGoEj6qsaa	No.  sit-ups help build abdominal muscles underneath the fat of your belly so that when you do lose weight around the tummy area from exercise (cardio mostly) & diet, then you will be able to see the muscle that you have been building doing crunches and situps, etc...|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	A better and easier way to lose your belly is to lie on your back with your legs together. Raise them straight up in the air (you may need to put something small under your hips to raise them enough or just put your hands there). With your feet together move your legs in small circles - 50 reps one way and then 50 reps in the opposite way. You can do this in bed morning when you wake and at night just before sleep. This exercise works better than sit ups or crunches and is much less harsh on your back. Keep the circles small and do this exercise at least twice a day and your stomach will get tighter and flatter within a few weeks.|`|1dL6fU0Haa	If you are looking for rippling muscles to come bursting out of your mid-section, you must lower your total body fat percentage.  Consistent ab workouts are great to strengthen the muscles of the stomach but will not completely help to make those muscles more evident.  <br>  <br>  You will see dramatic claims on T.V. about inches lost with their abdominal apparatus and you yourself may see some results with these machines but this is because it is forcing you into a cardiovascular workout.  Going from doing nothing to anything will improve your fat percentage to an extent and it is this factor that will help you make your abs visible.<br>  <br>  So instead of pulverizing your stomach everyday and risking potential injury from overtraining, limit your ab workouts to 3 times a week and shift the bulk of your energy towards more cardiovascular work.  The extra calorie burning is the trick to help you achieve the washboard look you desire.|`|cIUYAmHPaa	Targetted weight loss is quite hard, many people would say impossible, nevertheless the one diet which clearly delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it was reported in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I lost 20 pounds, it clearly does produce success!|`|MfKWHH4Naa	do situps and cardio. the cardio burns the fat, the situps tighten and tone.

ItJzrvQ4aa	In the morning of your first day of following this plan, mix 32 ounces of water with 1 1/4 cup of egg white or whey protein powder, it is very important to purchase a protein powder that is free of any sugars, artificial sugars, or artificial flavorings or colors. Protein powders can be purchased at health and nutrition stores, supermarkets and big box stores such as Target or Walmart<br>  Starting at 8:00 a.m. and ending at 4:00 p.m., drink a 6-ounce glass of the protein shake every two hours. This is followed by a large salad topped with 3 - 6 ounces of lean chicken, fish or turkey at 6:00 p.m.. The salad can be made of any vegetables of your choice, but it must include plenty of green leafy ones. You can have up to 6 cups of salad topped with the juice from ? lemon and 1 - 2 tablespoons of olive or flaxseed oil. <br>  One hour after each protein shake and your salad, drink an 8 - 12 ounce glass of water.

If you're trying to lose weight, cut carbs elsewhere, and eat only a handful of nuts a day to make up for lost carbs.<br>  Also... I heard that peppers help to speed up the metabolism! Who doesn't love that?!

Get a stationary cycle for exercise, do it for 20 minutes daily (you could also increase its saddle seat to force your legs to grow, this is proven very effective, a 27 yr.old man tried it and gained 2 inches in 3 months).

ads40ROCaa	Hi sweetie,<br>  I can't tell you how to get them off faster because I've never had them, but I can tell you something that will hopefully make you smile? :)<br>  <br>  First, don't worry about your age, my best friend got hers on when she was 17! Better than that, I know of three people who have gotten them on older! One is 34, one is 37 and one is 45! You're still young to get braces :)<br>  <br>  Also, you may not think this, but I think you're lucky. I hate my teeth. I never smile showing my teeth. I can't get braces though. Firstly, everybody seems to think my teeth are perfectly straight (which makes me laugh every time.) and secondly, I have to be very careful. I can't get a cut let alone anything else, or else I will get a lot sicker.<br>  <br>  Your lips may stick out a little for the first day, but they're probably just a little swollen. This usually goes down after about 2 or so hours after getting them on though, so I doubt you'll have to worry about that :) I personally think that braces look adorable on girls, so hey, I'm sure you'll look cute!<br>  <br>  Sorry I couldn't be of more help love.|`|y7Rna5zhaa	Make sure you keep everything clean! If you don't you may have to have you're bracers on for twice the amount of time. I was told my bracers were only going to be on for 9-12months. Ended up being 2 1/2 years. If you're really worried about you're smile than the bracers should fix everything up for you. And if you do get bracers and then change your mind about them, just think of what you will look like when you get them off. =]

VLCUDZlcaa	omg, i felt like crying when i read this question...so so sorry to hear you had a panic attack in public.  I am the queen of anxiety and panic/anxiety attacks.  Ive had major ones in public which makes it even worse.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do in that situation is to concentrate on your breathing - the reason you get light-headed, faint/dizzy, and out of control mentally is coz your body has too much adrenaline going thru your body which causes your heart rate to go up and increase your breathing (usually short gasps).  Increase in heart rate makes you sweating and dizzy and fast breathing actually causes not enough carbon dioxide in your blood system.<br>  <br>  When you feel like you are about to have a panic attack (which is actually acute anxiety), then focus on taking big deep breaths (dont worry about how you look or what others think)....try and distract your mind and just breath slowly and deep.  Cupping your hand over your mouth as you do this will give you more carbon dioxide which will help with dizziness.  The key is to know when the attack is coming and acting immediately before your brain triggers the panic.<br>  <br>  sweetie, it has nothing to do with your personality, your brain/body is programmed to protect itself and if you put yourself in a threatening situation (in your case around strangers etcc), then it reacts by pumping adrenaline into your system as a way of getting ready to 'fight'.  It all sound a little crazy, but trust me, you can fix things...i have :)<br>  <br>  At one stage i was in a state of panic attack for virtually every minute i was awake....but im over it now :)<br>  <br>  ps:  I managed thru it without medication (although i did try and it made me too sick and more depressed!!)|`|L8SqgQCkaa	check your blood pressure. high blood pressure will cause these attacks. check it while your having the attack. I also used to have vary bad ones, after I was put on blood pressure med, all gone. caffeine will raise blood pressure, excite the mind, stay away from it.|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	Aww hun, <br>  <br>  I know how you feel, I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder, followed by Health Anxiety followed by Panic Disorder, I had a panic Attack every day for about 15 months, Until I saw a psychologist. I had an irrational fear of death, but subconsciously. She somehow stopped all that!<br>  <br>  I had to do self - help techniques. Planning, tell myself it was ok - the worst that could happen was that I'd hyperventilate, I couldn't die from them, Every time I had one I thought I was dying, but every time I recovered, the best thing I ever did was to learn how to give myself a panic/anxiety attack, Just keep taking short deep breaths in and out and eventually you would feel the symptoms of a panic attack - Dizzy, feeling like you are going to drop dead, faint, can't breathe, tight chest etc.. That helped me realise it was just my body telling me it didn't have enough air.<br>  <br>  You should see your GP about it they can really help and I didn't have any medication for it.<br>  <br>  Oh and yes, caffeine makes them a lot worse! I would find that caffeine, alcohol, being tired - worst 3 things for me! I am also a shy person, I do think it has something to do with lack of confidence, but again, see your GP they will help you. There is a cure. If only you could have seen my July 07 - May 08. xxx<br>  <br>  Good luck hun if you want to email me you can xxxx|`|zAoKd2DBaa	well Caffeine can contribute because it increases your heart rate. <br>  <br>  i know exactly what you mean - at my worst i felt i was living in a parallel universe, light headed all the time, worse when walking on slopes - so i avoided them! Heart racing, stomach churning, sense of absolute panic and terror.  If you understand what is happening it helps.  You are becoming stressed and stress releases adrenalin which increases your heartrate and puts you into fight or flight mode - if you were in an emergency situation you would need this to either run or fight for your life.  But when you don't use up the adrenaline it causes these unpleasant symptoms.  You may findyou have pins and needles too, you may have an upset stomach - your body will want to get rid of food so it can run or fight better ! You will start to feel very alarmed by these symptoms and probably breathe quicker, short shallow breaths which then cause you to hyperventilate which makes you feel worse, panic more, breathe quicker.......self perpetuating. <br>  <br>  Try to say to yourself it's just an anxiety attack it will be over soon.  concentrate on breathing very slowly and deeply, try and concentrate on something else.  Your instinct is to get out of wherever it is you are which is not always possible. <br>  <br>  Do you have a source of stress in your life ? ? if so, removing it is the most ideal way to limit these attacks. I think once you've had them though, a tiny bit of adrenaline rush reminds you of the feeling.  They may never go completely away but trust me, they really will become less big, less scary and much less often.  I hardly ever get them now, but 5 years ago i had to take 3 months off work and then take medication, which i am now off.  I removed the source of stress from my life (my partner, lol) and set about re building my life.  Sometimes now if a little stressed or rushed, i get the odd horrible feeling that i'm going to get a panic,  and to be honest if that happens and i'm at home, i crack open a bottle of wine and tell myself relax! <br>  <br>  You can control these and you will be fine, just believe that.|`|vfMesuzeaa	look at this one <a href="http://healthywealthytip.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://healthywealthytip.blogspot.com</a>|`|ZlNFOgO7aa	I suffer from GAD (generalised Anxiety disorder), basically I am anxious over everything in my life. I haven't yet got to the part of feeling like I'm going to pass out, but I have been seeing a Psychologist on and off for about 10 years, we now just catch up when I'm not coping. He has taught me a great deal about self calming and changing the inner monologue you get in your head, you know, "I can't do it" to "I can do it and this is how". I still suffer terribly when I am very stressed and then I start to obsess about strangers on the street, thinking they are talking about me.<br>  <br>  Caffeine wont help the anxiety, but it can contribute to you feeling on edge all day.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is that you need to get help now, go and see your GP. If you live in Australia there is a mental health initiative now being run by the Government where people get up to 12 visits subsidised by medicare to go and see a Psychologist. You get 6 initial visits, but if the Psychologist thinks you need more they can up it to 12.<br>  <br>  You may need to take medication for a few months to help keep you relaxed. I take 20mg of aropax daily when having a hard time (which always happened after I have my kids) and I usually am on them for 6-12 months, But that is an extreme case. If you get meds and they are right for you, you should notice a difference within 7-14 days. If you are happy to go the medication route I would still have the visits with a Psychologist, they are fantastic at helping people manage disorders like this, it is so treatable.<br>  <br>  Good luck sweetie.|`|382b69da7c50fc8ccf68048ab522a879aa	Yeah I know exactly what you mean. I actually ended up in a treatment centre for 2 weeks because of them. They were ruining my life.<br>  They are very unpleasant, arent they. <br>  What I mostly learnt while in treatment were self help techniques to cope when they did happen. Slow yourself down, breathe deeply. Tell yourself it is ok, nothing bad is going to happen. You are being irrational. Think of the worst thing that could possibly happen ( the reason why you started feeling it come on in the first place) and usually you will find you are getting worried over not much at all.<br>  Its basically training the brain to not react anymore. <br>  If they continue it may be helpful to be referred for some professional help. Maybe see your Dr and see what they have to say. Seeking help was the best thing i ever did.<br>  Lots of luck and hugs to you. Hope you feel better now.<br>  <br>  Edit: Another poster said high blood pressure, panic attacks are not caused by high blood pressure. ( I didn't thumbs down though.)

tv7Im1eKaa	this is personal to me ,,,its a good advert,my dad had a stroke about ten years ago .if we  had of done what they told us to do .maybe he wouldnt of lost his speach ,we rang the doctor  instead of dialing 999.in that time he had another one.im just glad he,s here today ,but anybody with them symptons must call 999 .....it is a matter of life or death and the quicker you act,you could maybe save someone from some other kind of dissability that a stroke leads to ...emma xxxx|`|AA12367392	We don't have a stroke one we have a cancer one about smoking, then they show old and young people and say if you do so much for smoking what does it do for you, then there's another one about different people telling their stories about what happens if you speed and or drink drive, 1 girl in a wheelchair, an old lady who lost her son etc., my logic of it all (after I gave up smoking) was to take young people to the cancer ward and show them first hand, what happens if you smoke - before hand I didnt care but after looking after mum and dad dying from cancer it sunk in, mums was in her lungs, went to her brain then bones, then she was gone, and dad kept suffering mini strokes and nobody knew till he had a major one, I took care of him too for a few months until he was able to look after himself, he went into one of those pensioner places that you give them 85% of your pension and you have a room of your own like a little unit, all meals included etc., and one day he was doing the laundry he had a massive one and died carrying his washing back to his room, was dead before he hit the floor, so any ad that they show is not shocking enough for what happens in real life and until it touches someone you love you dont think about it, cause I know I didn't, thank god for the strength he gave me to give up, has been 16 years now! :)|`|HDZyPMMJaa	no its not <br>  im 34 and have had two strokes the first one was when i was 30<br>  <br>  and nobody knew what was wrong with me ...to young to have a stroke!<br>  <br>  so its good all people know what happens when some one has a stroke so they can act fast the first 3hours can save life's!|`|vCtCW8ODaa	if it gets the message home to people then no its not on too much... anyone of us at any age can have a stroke at any time, it can wreck your life totally unless action is taken FAST|`|XrT3gIRbaa	We had a disscussion about this at home, and decided that there had been worse (worse is the wrong word more hard hitting) adverts in the past so no not too much just piercing a point.|`|zNkqZbE8aa	i watch TV everyday and i haven't seen it|`|7jM9Ghchaa	yes and when you see the burning as if his brow is on fire yuck its getting terrible ?also the horrible photos on the fag packets the guy with the tumour on his throat?  lets listen to music and have our Scooby snacks?|`|q4pLY5F8aa	3.2.2009: a 81-years old man died of stroke while I was working.

He rang the doctor who requested an emergency ambulance.  My husband set off immediately to his brother's home.  The ambulance had not arrived 2 hours later so another call was made asking for the emergency ambulance.  My husband arrived home 4 hours later and still no ambulance.  He absolutely blasted the surgery and emergency services and within minutes a paramedic on a motor bike arrived followed by an ambulance.  It took 4 hours!  4 hours!

In order to produce a period, your body makes hormones, like estrogen and progesterone. These hormones are kept in the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and ovaries inside your body. In order to trigger ovulation and menstruation, these parts of the body need to send signals to one another. Sometimes, these signals get crossed or skipped, causing irregular periods.<br>  <br>  Stress is also one of the cause, including diet.<br>  <br>  you might want to visit the following website to learn more :D|`|nJanBmEqaa	Hmmm.

wYMdGx6Faa	Well, as you should know your body has pores all over for the release of things such as toxins and liquids to keep you cool. (Sweat) Your body is constantly renewing itself by getting rid of old, dead skin cells. Showering helps your body along with this process. While it is not particularly necessary to help your body along with this task, as it is capable, showering is a good idea anyways to reduce smell and any chance of clogged pores and body sores from bacteria build-up depending on what you get into on the day to day basis.|`|9fLlQcSpaa	i prefer a shower cause i work in a peanut butter factory and when i come home i have to shower to not bathe in the nut butter. so i mean it depends how dirty you get. as far as health i mean the cleaner the better.|`|31MhGY6Daa	Try showering at least every other day and remember to wash your private areas.

They only fail if used incorrectly or they split, which normally only happens if you have vaseline or baby oil involved which weakens the condoms latex. Condoms are the only contraceptive that offers protection against STI's like chlamydia and HIV. Condoms are a barrier method of contraception so basically form a wall that the sperm can't get through, which means no sperm can reach an egg so no pregnancy and no mixing of bodily fluids so no STDs. Although not 100% guaranteed, because accidents can happen, they can split etc. they are the best and most complete form of contraceptive that we have. Use them with the contraceptive pill to give 100% protection against pregnancy because the pill changes your hormones so that your body isn't able to get pregnant in that cycle.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	No to both.|`|3Ophdo9raa	Condoms say on the box they are only 97% effective. The only guarantee is abstinence.
wDRyxp5vaa	You just gave a much-too-common myth in your question:  heavier people get diabetes.<br>  <br>  Not true- unless you're talking about type 2 diabetes.<br>  <br>  I have type 1 diabetes and, like many, was way underweight when diagnosed.  I lost 14 pounds and was underweight before that.  Type 1 diabetes is where the pancreas stops producing insulin and we must make up for it with shots.  Most newly diagnosed type ones are in diabetic ketoacidosis, where their blood sugar is so high that the body is basically eating its own fat for energy.<br>  <br>  Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, either the body does not produce enough insulin or the cells ignore the insulin. Insulin is necessary for the body to be able to use glucose for energy. When you eat food, the body breaks down all of the sugars and starches into glucose, which is the basic fuel for the cells in the body. Insulin takes the sugar from the blood into the cells|`|XSXdMu0caa	if you are overweight you are likly to get it<br>  its about the pancreas i dont know specifics but when you are diabetic you either have too much sugar in your system and not enough insulin in your system ( from your pancreas) to break it down or not enough ( pancreas producing too much insulin)<br>  if people are fat then the pancreas has to work harder and produce more to get around the body <br>  <br>  there are different types of diabetes one you can control with diet one with tablets/ needles<br>  it can be controlled but if not taken care off can cause a hypoglasemic fit - i think and people can die|`|9ZTYDMNPaa	You pancreas is to produce insulin naturally.  If your pancreas stops working your body can no longer produce what it needs to break down sugars in the body.  If you don't take care of yourself you can die.  By taken the insulin you protect you body organs.  The pancreas is dead but can be controlled.  You have to take care of yourself.  Eat better, exercise, try to keep sugars steady.  If your blood sugar is low have a sugary snack if to high drink plenty of fluids.|`|ypnWDDB8aa	When you eat sugary content your pancreas creates insulin to break it down.  Diabetes is when your pancreas cannot create suffcient amounts of insulin to break the sugar down creating high blood sugar, or low.|`|pdbc4souaa	It is a metabolic inability to control blood sugar levels. It is likely to be caused by a genetic tendency which is triggered by any of several life experiences. Fat absorbs insulin, insulin regulates blood sugar.<br>  <br>  You don't die from diabetes, you die from atherosclerosis. But before that happens, you will likely have one or more of the following symptoms: Peripheral neuropathy, kidney failure, heart disease, blindness and a pathetic inability to absorb critical details.<br>  <br>  Since you are not interested in detail, I will only say that Google will be happy to supply you with as much detail as you can absorb,|`|jFqWYC4uaa	In simple terms, it’s a disease wherein body is not able to store excess blood sugar (energy) and is flushed out by the kidneys with urine, resulting in symptoms like frequent urination, weakness and general body degeneration.  <br>  <br>  This condition arouse out of malfunctioning of insulin producing gland called pancreas. Insulin is a kind of protein, which reacts with excess blood sugar, which in turn help in storing it in the lever to be released whenever blood sugar level drops below normal. <br>  <br>  Heavier people tend to eat more putting extra burden on pancreas resulting in malfunctioning of the gland.

A half hour on the elliptical can be boring. Not so a videogame that's always offering you new rewards, like vocal encouragement ("great job") and extra points in the Wii Bank that unlock new exercises.

JYHlPczxaa	This depends on a few different factors<br>  <br>  Calories In And Calories Out<br>  <br>  Already you know that you should limit your calories if you want to lose weight. But a lot of people still don't understand the full equation.<br>  <br>  Your body burns a set amount of calories every day before you do any exercise. This is to power your brain, heart, organs and the rest of the body. If you're a man then it will burn 2500 per day and 2000 for a woman.<br>  <br>  If you eat less calories than you burn then your body still needs energy so it will get it from your fat. So as long as you stay under this figure then you will lose weight.<br>  <br>  So how much should you reduce this figure for quick weight loss?<br>  <br>  Safe Calorific Deficit<br>  <br>  Dietitians and health professionals agree that you should lose no more than two pounds a week. To achieve this, you need to have a daily calorific deficit of 1000. So if you are a man you should eat no more than 1500 per day and 1000 a day for a woman.<br>  <br>  Frankly, I know of many people who have eaten even less - perhaps only 500 calories per day and then lost much more weight. Whatever target you choose is up to you but at least you have the information you now need.<br>  <br>  Adjustments<br>  <br>  You may need to adjust this figure slightly. For instance, if you are smaller or taller than average then you may beed to add or subtract 100 from your figure. Don't let this be an excuse to go overboard though. I know many people who claim to be "big boned" and then eat 200 calorie more than they should and then not lose any weight.<br>  <br>  Also, remember that this figure is before exercise. If you do some daily exercise then you could just use a smaller calorific deficit. If I were you though, I would let exercise be a bonus and still aim to eat 1000 calories less. This way, the exercise will help you to lose that little bit more weight which you will feel really proud about.<br>  <br>  Tips<br>  <br>  I have a couple of tips that will help you to eat less calories and not feel too hungry.<br>  <br>  The first is to increase your intake of fruit and vegetables. These are filling foods and full of nutrition. I'll bet you a million bucks that you are not eating enough of them already. They also have a low glycaemic index which means that your body will burn them more efficiently and you will not get hungry between meals.<br>  <br>  Also, practice better portion control. Instead of 3 large meals a day that leave you feeling stuffed and then hungry again after 3 hours you should increase your meals to 6 per day but eat only half as much.<br>  <br>  Because you will be eating every 2 to 3 hours you will get less hungry and you will never feel stuffed. Your body will burn it better and be less likely to put on any fat.|`|9XmJPjXvaa	go here and use their calorie guidance calculator t determine the recalories<br>  <br>  <a href="http://loseweightin14days.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://loseweightin14days.blogspot.com/</a>|`|KHhRgzXtaa	u can safely and fastly lose weight on 1000, to 1200 a day,, make sure u exercise too, this will get ur body burnin fat xxxxxx|`|85KL0eUUaa	1100-1400 calories.|`|CrZxYK5raa	i would say eat about 1500 healthy calories a day.

2lCM1agNaa	I know exactly what you are talking about, it used to happen to me when I first started exploring masturbation: a v brief pleasurable feeling and then it's over.<br>  <br>  I believe a good O is something you build up to. Sure, you have your super-sensitive hyper-orgasmic types but these girls are much rarer than the media makes them out to be.<br>  <br>  Play with yourself but once you feel you are close to the climax, STOP and wait a couple of seconds. Give yourself enough time (but not too much) to bring yourself down but just a little. You'll be able to judge this perfectly with yourself. Once you've brought yourself down a little, play with yourself again and build up. You should do this several times, it will build up the feeling and it feels great (almost like teasing yourself, but it's sooo worth it). Relax your body and breathing throughout, don't tense up and try not to tense up your vagina either (you may probably notice that it might involuntarily start to contract a little on it's own before you come, which is a good sign, but not a necessary one)). When you feel  ready to play with yourself until you come just keep relaxed, but because you've built it up it should feel more powerful and may last longer. <br>  <br>  Practice it but don't beat yourself up over it if it isn't to your expectation! The most important thing is to feel pleasure and enjoy practising it over time. Don't concentrate too much on it either because the more on your mind, the harder it is to reach it, and your brain is the biggest sex organ after all (I've had Os in my sleep; even without stimulation 'down there'!). Good luck:)|`|AA11046205	There are internal and external orgasms. Clitoral and G spot (internal). Both need lots of practice and experimentation to perfect. That's the fun part.

vOaa2d1Daa	If you're fasting, that's not the way to go to lose weight.<br>  I would suggest that you get an exercise ball according to your weight and start bouncing off the calories. Not only will this reduce your weight, but it will perk up your vitality and get your circulatory system into balance. Now, as you're doing that, you ought ot be think ing that you should be FIT...start getting juice from fruit istead of a bottle or can..start squeezing it youself.

YC8X25OXaa	If it is an over-eating disorder, I'm afraid I can't help.  But if it is something like anorexia/bulimia, then one of my friends was diagnosed with both last year so I can share my experiences of that with you, and hopefully it'll help.<br>  <br>  It took quite a few visits to the doctor to diagnose her.  This is because although a doctor may suspect, all they have right there is a skinny person who is very reticent about answering their questions and in denial about being ill.  So first time he did things like check her heart and blood pressure, take a blood test to see if she had anaemia and listen to her breathing.  He also asked her a few questions about her diet and her exercise regime, being aware that she was probably lying to him.  He then spoke to her parents.  He arranged for her to visit a counsellor to talk about things, and asked her to keep a record of what she ate.  After a couple of weeks he told her parents she had anorexia and bulimia, although he didn't say that to her because he knew she'd deny it and get very emotional, which wouldn't help.<br>  <br>  To be honest, diagnosing it wasn't really the big deal - it was clear she had some kind of eating disorder and putting a name to it wasn't what was going to help her.  That only came through support in the right ways (as her friends, we just had to act normally and go out with her and keep an eye to make sure she didn't sneak off to throw up or anything, but not try and force her to eat) and lots of counselling.<br>  <br>  She's better now by the way - her dad took for abroad for a month in the summer and away from pressures from her mum and her work and from people who'd give her lots of attention, she got back to normal.<br>  <br>  I hope your friend is okay, and that if she does have a disorder she gets better soon. I know this will be really hard on you too, so can I recommend that you also think about counselling?  I went with a couple of other friends once a week for three months and it really, really helped to talk about our concerns and things with a professional.|`|CjRfJbncaa	I don't know what Dr.s do, but you may want to share the following set of articles with your friend . . . <br>  <br>  What Is Behind Eating Disorders? :<br>   - When Food Is Your Enemy<br>   - Anorexia and Bulimia --The Facts, the Dangers<br>   - What Causes Eating Disorders?<br>   - Eating Disorders--What Can Help?  <br>  <a href="http://watchtower.org/e/19990122/article_01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/e/19990122/article...</a>|`|IODhng5qaa	first off too see if someone has an eating disorder, its not like we are in the 1800s and no one has heard of an eating disorder.

I am often very very horny and some of the best sex (for me and I've been told, for the guy involved) has been during that time. <br>  <br>  Personal hygiene shouldn't be an issue as long as your wife doesn't have any blood borne diseases).<br>  You should cover the bed and place a soft towel (one you don't mind getting bloodstained) under her. If it's oral she wants, you can give that to her if she wears a tampon and used a few baby wipes so you won't taste/see any blood at all. If she wants penetration, wear a condom if you don't want blood on your penis.<br>  You have to remember that women don't actually expel a lot of blood during their periods so you should actually be in contact with very little of for the relatively brief period of sex.<br>  <br>  Don't knock it until you've tried it!|`|HcXtS3pxaa	It's normal!

fS9ophX6aa	If you have vague tummy pain, around the tummy button, which then moves down to the lower right side of the abdomen you may have appendicitis. Try this test: push your hand hard into to<br>  the lower right hand corner of your abdomen, around the groin area. If you get a sharp pain like someone stabbing you then you'd better go to A&E as you might have appendicitis. There are loads of other causes for an upset tummy which are much less serious and will pass. But if you get pain that means your tummy is too painful to push with a hand then you should go to hospital.
sQu3LLqtaa	Could be a magnesium deficiency.  There is plenty of magnesium in nuts.|`|di4yVFRraa	You probably think you're getting enough sleep, but it doesn't seem to be the case. When your muscles start to twitch in your face, it can be a sign of a more serious problem, especially when it is prolonged, so I do recommend going to the doctor. But, it could be that your eye is dry and your body is trying to get you to blink. Maybe you have something in the eye. Still, when this happened to me, I went to the doctor and they discovered that I had what could be called a sleep debt. I was a college student at the time and while on most nights, I would get 8 hours or sleep, there were those nights I needed to stay up to get things done, and those nights were catching up with me. I'd feel fine after I got the rest, but once I learned to manage my time better on projects and papers and not have to skip the occasional night's sleep, and went to bed early enough that I didn't need an alarm, I stopped having the twitches, I started having so much extra energy, and lost a decent bit of weight, too. If you can, let yourself have a night where you sleep until you absolutely don't want to sleep anymore, drink plenty of fluids, and don't think about anything you have to do the next day. There's plenty of time for that while you're awake.

ItJzrvQ4aa	There are numbers of reasons why a person is not tall, and most of them do not<br>  have any effective treatment.<br>  Probably the commonest cause is genetic, that is to say that one or<br>  both your parents are below average height, or that short stature runs<br>  in your family. There is really nothing that can be done about this. <br>  The other cause that most people know about is a deficiency of growth<br>  hormone, which is produced by the pituitary gland situated at the base<br>  of the brain. If a deficiency of this hormone is discovered early<br>  enough in life, it is sometimes possible to give treatment with<br>  injections of growth hormone to increase height. However, by the time<br>  you get to 17 years of age, your bones may not respond to the effect<br>  of the hormone. The only way to find out if you have this condition is<br>  to discuss it with your doctor. Blood tests an X-rays to see how your<br>  bones are growing can usually make the diagnosis, but for treatment<br>  you would need referral to a specialist. These investigations should<br>  also show if there is any other cause for your short stature. <br>  But you should not think that it will definitely help you. Medical<br>  science can not make you the way you want to be - and it is true not<br>  only for height - so it's better to accept yourself as you are. Tall<br>  people are not necessary happier than short people - look at the<br>  tallest man in Ukraine, who was stripped of his title, lives alone<br>  with his mother, and has constant legs pain!<br>  The exercises they advertise on-line may increase your height<br>  temporarily for 0,5 - 1 cm, it's hardly noticeable and does not worth<br>  the trouble: your height varies during the day on its own.<br>  Very occasionally, surgeons will try an operation to lengthen the<br>  bones in the legs. This is very difficult, and takes many months or<br>  even years, and a series of operations. It is a dreadful operation,<br>  and I mentioned it only because you may have heard of it. Never<br>  consider mutilating yourself for a miserable increase in height, and<br>  be happy as you are.|`|AA11285960	are you a girl or guy? if you're a girl, just wear heels.  if you're a guy, you still have a little time to grow|`|0TT5q0cUaa	Well, you could try the following exercise regime: Please note: <br>  <br>  1.

Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth .

8bQkJ2Zjaa	Honestly-<br>  <br>  I am in the same boat as you almost. I am a type 1 and have been for 15 years. Alcohol will lower, yes LOWER your blood sugar levels. With that in mind, remember that I said ALCOHOL. The alcohol itself if drinks lower your blood sugar, however, the sugar in the fruit drinks such as smirnoff, beer, margaritas, anything with juice will raise your blood sugar levels dramatically (again, depending on how bad your diabetes is). Someone said before to mix your liquor such as Jack Daniels, Vodka, Rum, etc, with DIET COLAS. Yes, I know, it really sucks, but that is the best thing to do. If you do this, remember that alcohol can lower it, so if you do decide to make a captain and diet coke, remember that consumer large amounts may require you to eat something to make sure your sugar levels are somewhat normal. Now, if you don't think that is the best for you, and you decide you are going to drink a screwdriver (vodka and orange juice) or something like sex on the the beach, which also requires different juices, your blood sugar, either way, will most likely be going through the roof. So PLEASE be careful.<br>  <br>  So, if you are looking to get wasted, drinking shots or straight liquor is the way to go. Don't drink coolers, hard lemonade, anything that has a large amount of sugar. Another tip is to always try and drink vodka or rum with sugar free kool-aide. They have a lot of different flavors and can taste really good if you still have that fruity craving.<br>  <br>  But no matter what, even though I know it can be a pain be sure to have strips and a blood meter to take it as often as you can. Being drunk can sometimes impair this thought process, but then have  DD or something remind you. It's very important because while you are intoxicated, it might be hard to tell if your sugar is high or low.<br>  <br>  Good luck! And remember don't drink and drive!|`|e8Sgp92naa	If the person with diabetes is well controlled and knows what they are doing there is no reason why they can't have any alcoholic drinks that they'd like.  Alcohol can do funky things to blood sugar levels, the key is knowing what it does to you and how to fix it.  :-)<br>  <br>  Type 2's should go for low carb stuff like light beer, dry wine, and hard drinks with diet mixers.  <br>  <br>  Type 1's just need to perfect yet another balancing act.|`|8hULtMU9aa	there is no 'safe' alcoholic drink, but just make sure you drink in moderation and eat food while you drink, also let the people you are drinking with know you are diabetic so if you pass out or start acting funny, they know your blood sugar is funny, and that you are not just drunk|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Alcohol raises your blood sugar.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	Depends a lot on the type of diabetes you have and how you control your blood sugar level.  This question has been asked a number of times in this forum and there's a whole bunch of different opinions on this topic.  You should really discuss this with your endocrinologist.

Several docs have recommended exercise for my depression, stress, and anxiety.|`|6TSwoU3yaa	There are degrees of stress and there are degrees of physical fitness.<br>  In general, I would suggest that a healthy balanced lifestyle will help you, stressed or not.  But if you are inclined to stress, then you need time out.  The best solution to that is to take a long walk or run (depending on your own capabilities) and, if you really want to help your system along, go barefoot so as to improve your overall circulation.  Improved circulation leads to improved oxygenisation of the blood which leads to improved mental capacity which leads to less stress.|`|kTRcYaFcaa	Hugely important, and that is from someone who had anxiety disorders for many years and who, paradoxically, then became a fitness fanatic and marathon runner!!<br>  <br>  There are 3 lifestyle issues which can impact the onset of stress, and they are sleep, diet, and exercise, in no particular order. Not getting enough sleep, not eating properly and not exercising will, over time, and cumulatively, start to impact the body to the pont of burnout which is where the stress kicks in, then the disorders follow.<br>  <br>  It all happens over time, not all at once, which is where it catches us out, as we don't necessarily notice it happening.<br>  <br>  So back to your question, fitness is hugely important, but it is not alone in contributing to the management of stress. And by the way, it is the root cause of the stress which has to be treated, not the symptoms. By that I mean that whereas medication will help one feel better able to cope, it will not on it's own cure the stress - that can only be done by finding the root cause, and addressing that.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps - good question.

AA10736671	Never ever go for any type of Diet pills or any drug which claim that it will reduce the weight quickly. Taking Diet pills will kill u.instead u can reduce ur weight by natural way like this.<br>  1) The very first thing u should keep in your mind and that is the extra weight u put on didn’t come in overnight so it is not possible and also unrealistic to take it off quickly. You have to show patience. Please remember learning to eat well and exercise is the only solution to long-term weight loss.<br>  2) The 2nd important thing is that your body weight is controlled by the number of calories you eat and the number of calories you use each day. So, if you consume fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight. You can do this by becoming more physically active or by eating less. <br>  3) The 3rd important thing is never skip ur meal or go to a crash diet. Don’t ever try to starve urself. It is very important to understand that when you skip a meal or go on a crash diet, the result is that it slows your metabolism to conserve your energy. And when you lose weight too quickly for a few days, your body thinks it is threatened with starvation and goes into survival mode. It fights to conserve your fat stores. There fore keep in mind never try to skip ur meal, especially breakfast and always try to take food on time <br>  4) Before starting any type of diet, weight yourself and note ur whole body measurement in a dairy. Then after every week weigh your self again and compare with earlier measurements and see how much weight u r losing. Record a goal that you can reach in one month that is 4 to 8 pounds less than you weigh now. Set a goal you know you can achieve.<br>  Now some tips how to set ur diet plan.<br>  5) Start taking your food with out any oil. Try to use boiled/steamed vegetables, meat, and lot of salad. U can eat fresh and raw fruits, boiled/steamed chicken or red meat too but no pork. Please note and put it in ur mind that nothing fried or oily.<br>  6) No Junk Food, Potato & Sugar Please. <br>  7) Drink at least 3 ltr of water daily. Make ur habit to drink water as much as u can. In this way you are not only flushing out toxins, you are also teaching your body that it no longer needs to store water. When you feel starving, drink it as much as u can. Pls remember water is a natural appetite suppressant. <br>  8) Make you habit to use brown bread & sugar. Skimmed or low fat milk & yogurt.<br>  9) First try to avoid any type of soft drink but if u want to taste some thing sweet then drink any soft drink (remember use regular one, no diet cola pls) once in a week<br>  10) Make ur habit to eat once a day a vegetable soap or Thai soup (as ur dinner or lunch) But remember no corn flour in it. <br>  11) Just look at your food portion. It is much better to eat several small meals a day (like 5-6 healthy meals a day) than eat either one or two or three huge meal a day. <br>  12)  The most important factor in any weight loss plan is how many calories you consume each day, and eating too few is the most common mistake. Divide ur diet into 5-6 healthy meals a day (1 plate size only)<br>  13) One bowl of oatmeal can be taken as a break fast<br>  14) Smoking & any kind of hard drink is not allowed in this diet.<br>  15) Try to chew ur every food as much as u can, and then swallow it into ur stomach.<br>  16) Watch out ur every drink and every single piece of ur food. Stay away from fatty foods, junk foods, synthetic foods, foods with preservatives and too much carbohydrate. Don’t try to take foods that are made of white flour for example white bread, cakes, pasta etc and food contain sugar such as cookies, ice cream, candy etc.<br>  17) Remember after every 15 days you can take once in a while with a little treat any thing u like. But remember just a small portion. For example one small personal pizza or one small burger or small pastry.<br>  18) Try to adopt some healthy timing. Early to rise and early to bed. No late sittings. <br>  19) People usually want Quick and Easy result, we are all impatient. U have to be patient in terms of ur weight loss and never give up. Always keep in mind that slow and steady win the race.<br>  20) At least take this diet for 3 to 6 months. When u feel that u have achieved ur desired weight then make this is as a Life Style change for ur entire life.  Remember do not focus on just losing weight; try to concentrate on diet plan forever so that u will never have to loose weight again. Occasionally u can take junk food too.<br>  21) You have to keep in mind that above plan is a not a quick thin program. Don’t try to deceive ur body. It will destroy your metabolism and in the future the proportion of gaining weight is much higher and easier than today.<br>  22)  Exercise: Rule-of -Thumb: remember the formula for weight loss and that is Diet= 70% Exercise= 30%. So remember exercise is must with every diet plan.. The best indoor exercise machine is tread mill. Run daily on tread mill for 30 mnts ~ one hour as per ur convenient. If you don’t have Tread Mill then best indoor

Lack of desire may be related to the pain or the pain may be related to the lack of desire.<br>  <br>  Evaluate physical issues first then if not found...check out some mental reasons for decreased desire.  Decreased desire can make sex painful due to dryness.  Increase foreplay, roleplay, watch movies, use ur imagination.<br>  <br>  Still go to ob/gyn.  gl|`|cWuumdy7aa	Lack of sex drive (lack of libido) is common in women, but quite rare in men. However, there seems to be an FSAD bandwagon, driven by doctors who think that nearly half the female population (43 per cent) lack sex drive. Such a high number really doesn’t seem likely.<br>  In the UK, family planning clinics and Relate clinics see quite large numbers of women who complain of low libido. Our estimate is that at any one time, several hundred thousand women in Britain are troubled by lack of sex drive.Many of these women have no problems with having orgasms. Rather, they have no real desire to have sex and their minds are not turned on by the prospect of love-making.Fortunately, for many women lack of libido is only temporary. Some will get over it by themselves, and a lot more can be helped by expert medical or psychosexual advice.<br>  What are the causes of lack of libido in women?<br>  <br>  As is the case with men, lack of desire in women can be of either physical or psychological origin.<br>  Physical causes<br>  Anaemia, which is very common in women because of iron loss during periods.<br>  Alcoholism.<br>  Drug abuse.<br>  Major diseases such as diabetes.<br>  Post-baby coolness, a term we have coined for the loss of libido that often happens after childbirth. It is almost certainly linked to hormonal changes that occur at this time. The general trauma of childbirth also plays a part - and after having a baby, many women are too exhausted to think about sex.<br>  Prescribed drugs, particularly tranquillisers.<br>  Hyperprolactinaemia - a rare disorder in which the pituitary gland is overactive.<br>  Other hormone abnormalities: leading Swiss gynaecologist Dr Michael Nemec claims that abnormalities in the production of luteinising hormone (LH) often cause lack of desire. And top British gynaecologist John Studd says that many women who have lost their libido lack androgenic (male) hormones. This view remains controversial.<br>  You may be surprised that we haven't mentioned the menopause as a physical cause of loss of desire.<br>  Contrary to myth, the menopause doesn't usually cause loss of libido, and many women feel a lot sexier and have more orgasms in the postmenopausal part of their life.<br>  Psychological causes<br>  These causes are very common. It's understandable that when a woman is having a bad time emotionally, she may lose interest in sex.<br>  <br>  Psychological causes include:<br>  depression <br>  stress and overwork<br>  anxiety<br>  hang-ups from childhoods<br>  t sexual abuse or rape<br>  latent lesbianism<br>  serious relationship problems with your partner<br>  difficult living conditions, eg sharing a home with parents or parents-in-law. <br>  What should a woman do about lack of libido?<br>  Start by going to your GP, who can discuss the problem with you and do any necessary tests.<br>  An alternative is to go to a woman doctor at a family planning clinic, since these practitioners are used to dealing with this particular problem.<br>  Unfortunately, in the last couple of years family planning clinics have become swamped with patients, and many of them now won't take on psycho-sexual difficulties.<br>  If psychological or relationship factors are predominant, it may well be worth going to Relate or Relate Scotland. They are very experienced in these matters.<br>  Are there any medicines for female loss of desire?<br>  <br>  While it’s clear that the big pharmaceutical companies are searching for a drug that will turn women on, they have had little success.<br>  <br>  At present, drugs are not of much relevance to the average woman who wants to pep up her libido a bit.<br>  <br>  Far more important is to have the support and understanding of a partner who wants to help you defeat the problem - and who understands how to get you excited in bed.<br>  <br>  <br>  Testosterone<br>  <br>  Hormones are often suggested as a treatment for FSAD, particularly the male sex hormone testosterone.<br>  <br>  Doctors have been trying out testosterone on women for more than 35 years, rarely with much benefit. Side-effects include hairiness, spots, a deep voice and enlargement of the clitoris.<br>  <br>  However, there is clinical evidence to support the use of testosterone as a treatment for low sexual desire. In 2007 a testosterone skin patch called Intrinsa became available in the UK.<br>  <br>  This patch is only licensed on the NHS for women who have had an early surgically-induced menopause. Obviously, this is quite a small number of women.<br>  <br>  We do know that Intrinsa is being prescribed privately for other women with low libido, or hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) as it is now being termed. So far, reactions to this drug are mixed.<br>  EROS<br>  <br>  Inventions that are supposed to increase female desire come and go.<br>  <br>  In 2001 a device called the EROS was approved by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating low sexual desire.<br>  <br>  The gadget applies suction to the clitoris and so increases desire. Cost is around ￡200.<br>  <br>  The EROS has made relatively little impact in the UK. Our opinion is that you could achieve much the same effect with any inexpensive suction vib|`|AA10889282	See a doctor regarding the pain.

AA10736671	Under weight treatment<br>  1) The best way to add weight is to increase your intake of complex carbohydrates, particularly whole grain ones. Foods like whole wheat bread, muffins, pasta, crackers, and bagels are good to include. Also, legumes and fruits would be wise choices.<br>  2) In order to gain weight, you will have to eat more calories. You will need to include regular exercise and strength training into your lifestyle in order to prevent gaining too much weight as fat. And, as I mentioned, those extra calories should come mainly from additional carbohydrate.<br>  3) To start, set up a realistic goal weight for yourself. You may need to resign yourself to a less than (what you may consider) an ideal weight. Make good nutrition your priority, and weight gain the second.<br>  4) It is best to gain weight slowly and steadily. This will help to ensure that your weight gain is in the form of lean body mass and not excessive fat. Don't try to gain more than 1/2 pound a week. <br>  Some more tips<br>  5) Drink 6-8 glasses of distilled water a day.<br>  6) Eat frequent but small meals.<br>  7) Eat lots of raw fruits and vegetables (green leafy vegetables are great)<br>  8) Do not drink coffee, alcohol, soda pop,...<br>  9) Do not eat processed foods; white sugar, white flower,...<br>  10) Avoid red meat and animal fats.<br>  11) Reduce intake of dairy products.<br>  12) Do not smoke and avoid second hand smoke.<br>  13) Avoid hard drink too.
jE0Y9su5aa	I recommend the Pro-Form - PF900 Elliptical Cross Trainer (<br>  <br>  This is a middle of the road one which will fit into your budget.<br>  <br>  It is really good that you have set a buget of 400 pounds. Do not buy a cheap one!<br>  <br>  Sometimes purchasing a cheap clearance elliptical trainer can prove to be a risky investment. The elliptical cross trainer is a complex piece of fitness equipment that provides a variety of fitness levels to offer a low impact work out. For this reason, the elliptical trainer must be durable and well built. The elliptical trainer mirrors running and walking somewhat like a treadmill, however the difference is that instead of the foot coming down on a hard surface, the feet move in a smooth, seamless ellipse fashion like using an exercise bike. This eliminates a vast amount of damage to the knees, ankles and joints that a treadmill imposes.<br>  <br>  As a consumer when purchasing a cheap clearance elliptical trainer, one must do some research before buying. The amount you would expect to pay widely depends on if the elliptical trainer is motorized or non-motorized. Other factors include the brand name, the programs available on the elliptical machine, and other options that the machine offers. Also, one needs to pay attention to the length of stride that the elliptical has to offer.

a184CVO9aa	My dear darling girl, you are not a nut and you are right about that programme driving you mad. I have banned it in our house as I cannot stand it. The music, the stupid silly voices or noises that these creatures make are not that of a real child, and that airship thing - I'd like to blow that up!! Stop watching it for your own sanity and that of your child. It's a shame they don't put programmes on that we watched as kids such as Pogles Wood, Trumpton, Camberwick Green, Hector's House, The Wombles, The Magic Roundabout etc. There are far more enjoyable programmes for children today on Cbeebies (have just had to look to see how to spell it - how sad is that?!).  Well it's nearly time for Lazy Town. Take care and god bless xxx|`|TGuThoHpaa	NO.|`|d3lkLTR2aa	This question is the funniest I have read!  I remember those days.  For me, when my daughter was young, was Tellytubby time.  I used to want to live there on those hills of sunshine, flowers and rabbits.  I wanted a hoover that did not need me to push it.  I wanted a diet of custard and pancakes.  Most of all I wanted a purple handbag.  <br>  <br>  Why dont children realise what suffering their parents have to go through to bring them the joy they relish, be it innocent and worry-free.  I just wish we thought like them and it didnt bother us.  This is why the programmes of yesteryear when I was young just didnt seem to have the stress involved!|`|MHg9JhEKaa	Your adult brain is questioning the simplicity of children's tv. Yes I've done that too. Sometimes you wish you just didn't know so much about ordinary life, and could relax and enjoy the program like a child again. <br>  <br>  I do enjoy laughing at the adult presenters, dressed up in primary colours and pulling happy faces and doing 'ridiculous' things, like hitting eachother with an over sized wooden spoon. (I refer to Big Cook Little Cook, or should that be with an extra c each?).|`|HP7ZSFQXaa	I wouldn't say obsessive... but I found myself watching the entire Avatar series that was left on the DVR all by myself.  It was actually very good.  I like the storyline.<br>  <br>  I also watch Bindi the Jungle girl that is on the DVR as well.  Also very good.
QZHMckOhaa	I have anxiety and deal with all the same symptoms as you. you might also find that you have a ridiculously bad "nervous stomach ache", but all the time. when you have no problems you will find that you're still stressed out about things anyway even though you have nothing to stress about. valium is a medication that can help with this as it calms you down. a non-medical way of dealing with this, however, is to reflect on and analyse your thoughts in a quiet place so that you can assure yourself that there is nothing to worry about and calm yourself down by giving convincing reasons as to why you don't need to worry. it helps also (if possible) to get rid of toxic relationships in your life - for example friendships with people who treat you badly or make you feel unhappy more than 50% of the time that you're with them.<br>  i hope that this helps you|`|lG7MwXSBaa	The first time a person experiences a panic attack it can feel like their world is falling down around them. Nowhere feels safe as the anxiety becomes like a stalker lurking in the background.<br>  <br>  When this happens people begin to either avoid situations that make them anxious or they medicate themselves to the point where they are numb to the fear. I am sure you will agree neither of the above is a satisfactory solution.<br>  <br>  If you visit a doctor or psychiatrist you are almost always going to be given a prescription for medication simply because they are short on time and believe it to be the fastest solution to your anxiety problem. I am not judging these professions, many do an excellent job but are sadly too short on time to investigate the issue further and try a different drug free approach with you. That different approach is what you find here.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dwarfurl.com/ff121" rel="nofollow">http://dwarfurl.com/ff121</a>|`|wyZgApyTaa	smoke pot.. it'll calm you down a whole lot.|`|efDvTjJSaa	do not listen to kaitlyn<br>  <br>  oposite effect long term<br>  <br>  helps short term<br>   also illegal obviously|`|hieQHR0daa	Take regular exercise and keep a diary. You could also try reading and working through "The Artists Way". it's a bit odd but it does boost your self esteem as you work out for yourself what's important to you and can then set little achievable goals.<br>  If this is affecting your sleep you could try the simple exercise of taking each worry in turn and putting it "in a box" untill morning. For this you could use buttons or pennies and an actual box if you find it too difficult just to imagine.<br>  Do one difficult thing and then one enjoyable thing as a reward to yourself for getting the "difficult" thing done. That way you can still get through the day and achieve things.<br>  Another help can be Yoga, Tai Chi or simple breathing exercises. If you start to worry you can concentrate on your breathing or do a little Yoga/Tai Chi which will distract you and allow you to come back to focus.<br>  None of this is simple. It takes concentration and determination but it does definitely work.<br>  Good Luck.|`|SDvWtJRRaa	If your were on meds I would stay on them if they helped, today's world has plenty of things to be stressed about and if you can't calm down on your own, something that is hard to do, then go back on the medication and be your old self and don't worry so much, I have been on meds for some time and I'll never stop as they get me through the day without stress and I can enjoy my life and be happy even with all the crap that is going on around me.

Find some new hobbies or take some classes in something, or read books. Anything that will keep your mind happy. The effect will last even when you're not doing it because the endorphins in your brain will have been released (like taking a hit of a drug).

CTBCcCeCaa	Ovulation is when one or more eggs are released from one of your ovaries. This is the most fertile time of your menstrual cycle. Each month, 15 to 20 eggs mature inside the ovaries. The ripest egg is released into the pelvic cavity and swept into the fallopian tube. Which ovary releases the egg is fairly random. Ovulation does not necessarily switch between ovaries each cycle.

QZHMckOhaa	in times like these, often writing in a diary and doing things that make you happy rather than what you think will make your friends/family happy can help. when i say "doing things that make you happy" though, i dont mean like quitting your job and taking a holiday, i mean doing the things you need to do for yourself, not what you want to do. this could be restoring a relationship with an old friend or something else. this can be quite refreshing and make you feel better in a sad time, even if the reason for your sadness is completely unrelated.|`|z2TjjnxVaa	For me personally, as useless as it sounds exercise always helps. It releases endorphins and helps more than you would think. Also trying to get out in the sun, or even a tanning bed(maybe not all of the time). The vitamin e helps as well. I try to think of it strictly as science. Usually a change in  your diet would help drastically. Cut out high sugar products, heavily processed foods. Carbs are bad but in the right portion, or else you could become over tired and lethargic.<br>  <br>  In turn you will start to think more positively.|`|ibg67Xtvaa	i like everyone have good and bad days, but no matter the situation i can't dwell on the bad things because my main focus is one my child. changes come all the time some are good and some are bad what ever life throws my my way i have to make the mist out of it|`|3vWpUXsmaa	I live by the saying that everything happens for a reason.

ZNbauLJzaa	You should make an appt with a dietician or nutritionist to help you.  There are so many little nuances in the nutrition labels that a session or two with a health professional could explain to you.  Fruit has a lot of natural sugar, but there are also lots of vitamins and fiber in fruit so I don't know that  it's really an issue.<br>  Read the package nutrition guides and there is a place for sugar, and you can read the ingredients.  Anything ending in -ose is a sugar.<br>  <br>  If you are trying to lose weight it's the number of calories that is more of an issue.  If you are just trying to be healthy, you're doing really well because you don't eat a lot of processed foods and have a nice balance of foods throughout the day.|`|EeTs9DqUaa	Are you diabetic?  If you are that menu is way to high in carbs especially in the morning.  You should aim for 30-45 grams of carbs per meal and usually even less for breakfast.  Your first breakfast has 91 grams of carbs.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Nearly all of it is added. Not to mention Corn Syrup. The latter has been linked to Diabetes and other diseases especially in children and again more so in native Americans and Hispanics and Blacks.<br>  Honey at least has other positive properties than just to make things sweet.Refined sugar is the worst of all. Go with "turbinado" if you can or need to add some. It's less "messed with".Watch out for sugar substitutes too, they can be far worse for your body.<br>  Hard to tell how much is too much. It depends on your overall health, weight, age, gender and activity level. Genetics also plays a part in all this. Just be aware of what you are fueling yourself with and cut back when you can. Keep up your activity to burn of the excess.

Carbohydrates are essential to your body, as they supply your entire body with energy do perform daily activities and sustain wellness.<br>  <br>  You need carbs to lose weight in my professional opinion. Diet needs to be combined with exercise. If you have no energy, there will be no exercise.<br>  <br>  The general rule of thumb with diets are to eat 5-6 well balanced meals per day, and eat about 400-600 less calories than you would need to maintain your weight in a day (this is determined through a fitness formula). You will want to burn more calories than you take in, in other words.<br>  <br>  Diet combined with cardiovascular activity is what will get you the results for weight loss. Setup an appointment with a nutritionist in your area.|`|di4yVFRraa	By cutting anything completely out of your diet, you're just more likely to make yourself sick. Exercise more, choose low carb/high fiber grains whenever possible, and drink water over other drinks, and you're much more likely to lose weight. Cutting carbs makes sense only because a lot of carbs are rather sugary. However, you still need them in your diet. They do give you most of your energy, and while the idea is that when you don't have carbs to burn you'll burn fat? Well, there's a reason Dr. Atkins died of heart disease. Fiber is harder to digest, so your body works harder to do so, plus it helps to cleanse your colon. Water is best because it has no calories. A glass of cold water in the morning is also one of the best ways to boost your daily metabolism. Don't be afraid to get your water from some other sources, though. A cup of coffee is not bad for you. Freshly squeezed juice has a lot of vitamins. But, a liquid diet is nowhere near as filling as a solid one. Though, a bowl of a broth-based soup before a meal will help you to eat less. That's one of the biggest reasons a lot of Asians are slim. A bowl of miso soup before you eat? Delicious, nutritious, and it keeps you from eating too much rice.|`|Zjo0ownraa	sui, have everything you want in less quantities.<br>  dont over eat.<br>   eat nicely inthe morning as the metabolism is the heighest in the morning.and lowest at night.<br>   like the saying goes <br>  eat like a king in the moring<br>  eat like a prince inthe afternoon<br>  eat like a pauper at night<br>  good luck|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	That no carb diet works better on guys, it makes a lot of gals sick.<br>  Go over to the Spark People website, its all free, they have receipes, message boards, a food journal and tips on how to lose weight sensibly no fad diets there!<br>  Its <a href="http://www.sparkpeople.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparkpeople.com</a>|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	Don't ever low carb diet.

(So I think it is probably a good idea to use some form of contraceptive like the pill even if you aren't technically having sex, because virgins have given birth before.)<br>  <br>  However, if you took the blood pregnancy test and it showed nothing, it is very unlikely you are pregnant.  Periods can stop for all kinds of reasons - illness, rapid weight loss or gain, stress...if you've been worrying about being pregnant/about your period coming, ironically that can make it late.  And I once knew a girl who had periods for ten years totally normally, then they suddenly stopped for six months.<br>  <br>  I'm sure everything is fine and your period will come back soon.  If you are really worried something is wrong it never hurts to go and see a doctor, and of course you can always take a home pregnancy test if you are seriously concerned, but from the sound of it I highly, highly doubt you're pregnant.<br>  <br>  But as I say, I would advise you taking the pill, because it is always better to be safe rather than sorry isn't it?

It has been estimated that between 60% to more than 90% of sexual disorder cases can be traced to these factors. Psychological factors include interpersonal and sexual development problems, emotive and cognitive factors, as well as sexual history problems. <br>  <br>  Physical and hormonal factors are often grouped together to form organic factors. These factors include diseases, iatrogenic and medicinal side-effects. The most prevalent disease that causes sexual disorders is diabetes mellitus. Iatrogenic factors include perineal abdominal surgeries, such as hemorrhoid or hernia surgeries, colon, vascular and urological, as well as sympathectomy surgeries. In cases of sympathectomy surgeries, more than 60% of subjects suffered from post-operative impotence. Medical side-effects that result in impotence include treatments with anti-hypertension, anti-androgen or estrogen, antihistamine, anti-anxiety and depression medications amongst others. <br>  <br>  <br>  There are several available treatments for libido disorders and impotence, including supportive treatment, sex therapy, vacuum or mechanical therapy, and prosthetic implants. Supportive treatment includes administration of neurotrophic vitamins, hormonal preparations, as well as a non-hormonal preparation marketed under the name Libilov?. Selection of treatment should take into account effectiveness of treatment, the ease of administration, cost, as well as possible side-effects. As even organic impotence often includes, or results in psychological effects such as embarrassment or depression, the involvement of the female sexual partner in the treatment of impotence or libido disorders is generally very important. It is not uncommon that the role of the female partner or the degree of her involvement can determine the success of medical treatment of the male's impotence or sexual dysfunctions.<br>  <br>  You may also give him sex toys some porn material|`|cCXGEZxaaa	Does he happen to be on medication?

vVka4ZA0aa	Well, I haven't personally quit smoking, but I have family members who have. My father and my grandmother both quit smoking and they did it by weening themselves off of cigarettes to start. They tried smoking less and less, and they chewed gum in between to help keep their mouths busy, and they also bought stress balls and little things like that to keep their hands busy. It took a while, but they've both been smoke free for YEARS. It just takes a lot of will power and dedication.<br>  Also, you can try conditioning, which is a psychological method. Try associating something you loathe with cigarettes. Like, maybe instead of smoking the cigarettes you like, smoke ones that you physically can't stand to smoke. Things like that. Often times, instead of getting used to it, it'll just get to the point where you won't even be able to deal with it because when you think of cigarettes, you'll think of that horrible taste and the awful way they made you feel, and it will make you not want to smoke.<br>  Also, remember that people quitting smoking tend to be more aggressive, so don't let this stop you from helping yourself or your husband, just remember that once you're finally done with smoking and the cravings have stopped, everything will go back to normal and you'll be a whole lot healthier and have a little extra money.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|6k5fhFyBaa	Have you tried the patch?

It's going to be trial and error until you find something that works.

04JfNnMfaa	I don't know if gay sex is or is not part of modeling.  It sounds to me like this gentleman is taking advantage of your eagerness to get in the business.  What he did is called sexual harassment.  No job should ever be contingent upon your willingness to have sex.  I think you should start looking for another agency and let him know that his unwelcome advances will be answered by your attorney.  Best wishes to you.|`|AA11123061	no , ur boss is trapping u .|`|xBgKqAPHaa	no gay sex is not part of modeling<br>  are you even gay <br>  !<br>  most guys would no to say no straight away<br>  yuck<br>  gross<br>  say no|`|qzpQdJ44aa	Not at all.  It's up to you to decide whether you want to be with a man or not.  However, there's one thing, most blokes who do modeling, tend to be a gay or a bit bisexual.  It's quite common in the modeling domain for models to experiment with other guys.  This is only because they feel comfortable doing it.  Don't if you don't fancy guys.|`|ydHU7gYIaa	are you nuts?! youre not signed with a legit agency, so your career will not be "jump-started". its a scam and this idiot has most likely done this many many times. anyone who says "i dont know if it is" or "yes thats common" are total morons.|`|GfG6wupTaa	Have you heard of a casting couch?

oDz0FQpEaa	Your water intake is far too high. You're over-hydrating yourself. Normally a person should drink 1.5 litres of water a day but this can vary from person to person. If you exercise this goes up to 2 - 2.5 litres. You need to sip water often during your workout as your body isn't been given the time to process all the water as well as work out. If you gulp down 2 litres in 2 hours it's just going to swash about and give you acid reflux. You can actually damage your liver by drinking this much so please be careful. Some people have actually died from drinking too much. You can tell that you are drinking too much by the colour of your urine and how often you need to go to the toilet. If it is as clear as the water then it's a good indication that your drinking too much.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	I have acid reflux. It makes you burp a lot.

Also, if you believe you were drugged and drug dependent you should check into drug rehab for withdrawal and help|`|g3h42biwaa	I'm pretty sure after such a while all of the drugs have left your system honey. I've never done mescaline but, I am a former opiate abuser. Oxycodone is a narcotic painkiller that has much potential for abuse. It only takes about 3 days to leave your system, depending on the dose so it's unlikely you are suffering withdrawal, maybe you are experiencing some type of post-traumatic stress, which can trigger memories and emotions from that time in your life, maybe you are remembering the withdrawal you may have gone through during the abuse? Whatever it is, no one who has been through what you have should  go through the motions of healing alone, you should seek help whether it be a psychologist or a drug rehabilitation specialist. Whatever you choose to do I wish you the best!!! :)|`|kTZevQNHaa	You need to speak to a pharmacist and a toxicologist.<br>  Also a sexual abuse counselor.|`|XN0sRoqpaa	they are not gonna be in your system anymore.....|`|CuQFAPLDaa	Theres a good chance they r still in ur system.

EoroQbCraa	fill your mouth with hot, hot water from the sink...or etc.  then hold it in your mouth for at least a minute, and then swallow it right before you get your temperature taken.  that should do it if it's orally or through the ear.  idk how to raise it if taken through the anus (the old fashioned way).  good luck!  <br>  <br>  PS another way to do it is to overdose in focalin, it raises your temp. to about 102, but then again, that is NOT the safest way to go because it harms your system and liver alot.|`|sI5jTpoRaa	ive done this before : if you have  a heated blanket or heating pad place the thermometer under it for a few minutes and it will show a high temperature. or if you dont have those things you could try hot water on it for a few minutes until its over 101 bc when you go to show someone its going to drop.

78hPa4haaa	Yeah it probably was. Your first year of your period isn't gonna be very regular. You'll have some months where you get it then some that you don't. But after about a year it'll start getting into a pattern. Ask your mom or another women about it if you have any questions. Start carrying around pads so you'll be prepared the next time mother nature decides to show up. <br>  Welcome to 30+ years of cramping, mood swings, and back aches. :-)|`|PGRacfmdaa	I'm no expert but that does sound like your first period - mine started exactly the same|`|3qAtmbV6aa	it probably was<br>  its ok for u to get it and then not have it for a while<br>  just wait, it will come back|`|aCrhDYysaa	Yes, It is your first period!!!
YC8X25OXaa	Are you taking any medicine for it?  Like throat sweets or something which make the pain go away before you go to sleep? Because the effect of them would wear off overnight, causing the pain of the sore throat to come back again while you sleep, so it is there when you wake up.<br>  <br>  It could also be just because of your cold.  If you've got a blocked/runny nose then it's hard to breathe through your nose.  So during the night when you are probably lying on your back or your side and asleep, your body finds it hard to take in enough air through your nose.  So you breathe deeply with your mouth instead, and the effect of this is often a very sore throat in the morning, aggravated by your cold.<br>  <br>  Although colds and their symptoms usually only last a few days, sometimes they can go on for up to a week. If you can pick up some non-prescription throat spray or throat sweets and keep well hydrated to avoid your throat drying out, you should be okay.  However if it is still really bad at the end of the week, or if all your other symptoms clear up and your throat is still hurting, you should probably see some kind of doctor.  Is there a free clinic or something similar in your area you could drop into?|`|IKakoOfyaa	It's difficult to say what is causing it since we can't examine your throat or perform appropriate testing.  If it's strep and left untreated, that can be dangerous.  It could be a result of sinusitis (also needs treatment) or post-nasal drip from allergies, but again, there's no way to tell.<br>  <br>  If you live in the United States, there is a list of no cost/low cost clinics (click on your state of residence) here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.needymeds.org/free_clinics.taf" rel="nofollow">http://www.needymeds.org/free_clinics.ta...</a>

di4yVFRraa	Looking at the serving size of Kellogg's Raisin Bran? It's 59g. That's more than half of what you're eating, so you're really not having that much. While that is almost 30% of your daily carbs, you're also getting about 50% of your daily fiber. Your body has to work harder to digest fiber, so it burns more calories that way. Any way you look at it, it's really not bad for you. It's a little high in sugar, yes, but a lot of cereals are. Funnily enough, though... Lucky Charms have less sugar, as do a lot of "Kid" cereals. But you like it, and the fiber is good for you, so it's not much of a problem.|`|yxRGDjs2aa	Hi, No it's not a lot if you are active during the day.<br>  Ask yourself, am I putting on weight?

That would depend on you. Smoking helps people lose weight for a number of reasons. First one - Nicotine actually causes your blood vessels to shrink, which causes your body to carry lower amount of calories throughout your body. Second - While smoking you pick up a pretty bad habit. The habit of moving your hand to your mouth. Once you stop smoking you still have this little bad habit. <br>  <br>  So what happens is this. You stop smoking, the nicotine is purged from your body. Which allows your blood vessels to grow to their normal size. You still have this bad habit of moving your hand to your mouth. That habit causes you to place food into your mouth and increases the amount of calories you devour throughout the day. Increased calories plus an increase in the amount of calories your body can deliver to your body is an instant weight gainer.<br>  <br>  It is all about self-control!|`|iTYVV3etaa	Hey, try the Master Cleanse Diet!<br>  <br>  My mom followed the diet for 8-days and she lost 17 lbs!<br>   <br>  Even celebrities did it:<br>  The singer/actress Beyonce did it for 14 days and she lost 20-22 lbs!

There's something in her head that releases a pleasure feeling when she does it.  She may not want to do it, but it's an overwhelming feeling.  She may even obsess about it until she sees the blood come out.  For some there's a good feeling you get from it, yes it sounds crazy, but it's true.  She needs people that will help her around.  Talk to her.  Don't shut her out and please don't judge.  She may not realize what this can lead to.  She's dealing with emotional issues that she may not even realize yet.  Try to get her to talk to her parents or someone she can trust to help her.  If she doesn't, and it starts to increase, you need to tell someone.  She needs her friends and family.|`|sy4HR96eaa	for some people it gets rid of that pain they are feeling. <br>  <br>  they are in control, of that.<br>  <br>  how deep they cut, how much, all that.|`|FXP2pnlJaa	It is a psychological thing, of course. It is hard for them to hold in all of the pain that they feel, so they try to get it out in any way they can.

It's a very temporary relief, if it can even be called that.<br>  <br>  Without help, then yes, it can easily get worse. Do the best you can in getting her help. And that means being there to support her as well as talking to counselors or help lines.<br>  <br>  Oh, and as for the infections. Yes, she could get infections. If the cuts are surrounded by pinkish skin for a few days, then they probably are. Try and get her to wash them out, and don't allow her to cut herself again.|`|XSXdMu0caa	when you hurt yourself your body release endorphins to make you feel good <br>  it is her way of feeling better and trying to show or get rid of her emotions <br>  to help her you could check out the websites that have alternatives to self- harm just type that in a search page<br>  alternatives will help her cut down and quit <br>  here are some:<br>  - a hot bath<br>  - ice cubes on the skin<br>  - venting anger and frustration- scribble, wrip things, throw a pillow, punch a pillow<br>  - listen to some music <br>  - talk about the way they feel<br>  - keep a diary ( how bad did she feel today, did she cut herself? on a scale of 1-5/10, happy face, smiley face<br>  <br>  i hope she gets over it, your a good friend, i felt alone when i went thorugh it my friends werent helpful, it was a silly thing for me to do and i didnt do it for more than a year .<br>  my friends told me to jsut stop or they'd tell my parents, that made me feel worse and one of my friends started to cut herself for attention<br>  i didnt want attention i wanted to feel better - that made it worse cos your trying to stop thinknig about cutting and then your friend does it, its like they think its a joke or that they are missing out on soemthing and have to copy you <br>  <br>  you are a really great friend, be patient, dont judge and just be there let her know she can talk to you about anything :)|`|livxaHf8aa	My friend cut herself for the first time too, she said she felt depressed, and i couldnt help but feel she needed the attetnion. She was cutting her wrist (not ner the veins thank god) because of a fight she had with her parents. And i think she cut herself to get noticed by her parents and them to feel guilt. The same for friendship problems.<br>  <br>  First find why she feels depressed. if there is no reason.<br>  then give her hope and some remedies like, i always cheer my friend up with random jokes, and she instantly feels better because she's distracted. They feel better because they're releasing all the anger and pain through physical pain. It's just some pyscological thing. Your friend's depression may jsut be a phase, or if it keeps going, just keep reminding you're always there and shes not alone.|`|JrzXTKziaa	Thank you for being precise in your info, and I'll try to help you in the best I can. As for why people cut themselves, people have all sorts of reasons to do so but it all results in one outcome, the release of endorphins. When our bodies become damaged it triggers the release of endorphins in the pituitary gland at the base of the brain. Now endorphins are the feel good chemicals that make our bodies feel better and block pain, and when your friend cuts herself she is triggering the release of endorphins and thus making herself feel better.<br>  <br>  And yes she can get an infection from these cuts. If she wishes to cut herself please advocate cleaning of the cut sight and of the blade, as for the blade the best type are utility knife which offer a clean cut and little pressure to cut the skin, and with a clean cut it reduces the likelihood of the cut sight becoming infected. If you wish, you could make a “care package” a utility knife, alcohol wipes, and scar removing lotion all which can be bought at a local Walgreen's.<br>  <br>  Oh and yes these issues can get worse over time and need to be handled carefully, best of luck to you and to your friend.

AA10146541	I am assuming this tooth is a molar.  If so, then I would say that you have nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  I had a molar pulled back in 2005.  It was infected and I could not afford a root canal.  I worried so much that I could not sleep the night before, and I also thought I was going to pass out in the waiting room.<br>  <br>  However, I went into the room and told the oral surgeon my fears.  He immediately made me feel very at ease.  I told him I wanted to have IV sedation because me and Novocaine needles are worst enemies.  Since I was on a low budget and IV cost a lot more than Novocaine; I opted to take the Novocaine.  I firmly asked him if Novocaine will allow me to be comfortable and feel absolutely no pain.  He told me I would feel no pain with using just the Novocaine.<br>  <br>  He was absolutely correct.  I felt no pain during the procedure or anytime after.  He wrote me a prescription for painkillers which I filled but never had to take any.  <br>  <br>  The Novocain needle did hurt because I needed like 4 or 5 jabs in the roof of my mouth for a top molar.  However, it was nothing I could not handle.  Just a bit of a pinch and sting.  If I had to do it all over again, I would still choose the Novocaine, unless I was getting wisdom teeth out.  Finally, I was on my way home feeling very mad at myself for getting worked up over nothing.  It was really no big deal.  <br>  <br>  You will just have to eat soft foods for about a week or so.<br>  <br>  It is up to you if you want the IV.  My persona choice is to save the extra money and just got for the Novocaine because you will feel absolutely no pain either way.  <br>  <br>  Of course, if you have insurance or money is not a problem, then you could get IV.  You will need to have someone drive you home after the procedure.  I was in and out of the office in 15 minutes tops.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  P.S.  I never had IV sedation, but I never heard of it not working for anyone.  I have also never heard anyone say that the procedure hurt with IV sedation.  In fact, you will not remember anything at all about having your tooth pulled, based on what I have researched and heard from people who have had IV sedation.|`|ZcMqiFDNaa	nah, you shouldn't worry about waking up, what could happen though is the iv has an air bubble and the bubble goes to your brain and causes a deadly stroke. enjoy your dental exam.

D2VJP1ADaa	Only way to tone up is to do cardio.  Try doing 25-30 minutes a day, three times a week.<br>  <br>  Gotta get your heart rate up, and maintain it.  But you don't need to overexert yourself.<br>  <br>  Keep that up until summer and you'll be pleased with the results.<br>  <br>  And if your going to reduce your caloric intake, reduce it by about 300 calories per day, not by 500 as the other poster recommended.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	It's called a fat deposit, be happy where it is, it could be on your hips or thighs.

I am actually fat and I'm trying to use those to lose weight.|`|ETbb9BfSaa	By "small pouchy bell", I have to assume that you have some extra fat/adipose tissue sneaking up on it there. <br>  <br>  Yoga is for relaxation and in some cases an actual core exercise (strengthens your muscles), but it depends on what type of yoga you're doing. <br>  <br>  To get rid of this pouch however, (again I'm assuming its a small layer of fat) you need to to cardiovascular exercise to burn this layer of fat. Everyone has nice abdominal muscles, but in most cases it's simply a layer of fat covering them. Sit-ups, crunches, etc. strengthen your muscles, not remove fat from your body.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend doing at least 30 minutes of consecutive cardiovascular exercise throughout the day, and setting up some sort of healthy diet plan that cuts the amount of calories you need in a day be 300-400. Taking a daily multivitamin is a good idea as well, for anyone trying to accomplish any weight loss/fitness goal.<br>  <br>  When you notice the fat is starting to go away, then you can begin to strengthen your abdominal muscles. Take a look around in the internet and see what you can find. There are loads of resources with exercises (even YouTube!). <br>  <br>  Oh, and please please PLEASE be sure to stretch after you exercise. This prevents injury and improves your flexibility. You don't want to wake up sore and aching in the morning!<br>  <br>  See if you can setup an appointment with a nutritionist in your area to discuss your goals a bit more.|`|0uqfkjlgaa	well do 100 sit ups and 100 in the noon and 100 in the night<br>  <br>  i do 50  every 20 mins <br>  <br>  lol<br>  <br>  hopes that helps|`|JsffWlnEaa	its hard,but lower your calories a little more by 500 a day|`|W53KLjPgaa	sit ups tone the stomach but don't remove fat. eating healthily and going to a gym should do it.

Within a month you should see some improvement in the IBS.  Some of the other issues may take longer to clear up.  It sounds like you haven't been diagnosed as having celiac disease so if that is the case, consider at least getting the blood tests done to see if you have celiac disease before you start.  <br>  Depending on severity, it may take 6 months or so to clear up some of your symptoms.  <br>  Good luck!
AA10674555	Wow, sounds like you have to be your own Sherlock Holmes.<br>  <br>  What do we know? When we yawn, it is a reaction to needing oxygen. It can be physiological or psychological. The latter can be illustrated once when I had to read out loud in front of an audience portions of some very technical and hard to pronounce words. I was a stand in and had not looked over the material or practiced.<br>  <br>  In between my reading when the presenter was talking, I yawned. It was at almost every break in my reading.<br>  <br>  Lets say it is the physiological. Can you afford to get a CO2 detector. This could be a problem and perhaps a dangerous one. As a former asthmatic, my body tells me and I know automatically when I do not get enough oxygen.<br>  <br>  If it is not the air your breathing, then could it be that your body is not providing enough air to your brain. If you can get near a pulse oxymeter (ox-im-it-er), have someone read your blood oxygen level when your yawning. This will be hard to accomplish, unless you are a Sherlock about it.<br>  <br>  Nursing homes and hospitals have them readily available and someone might plug you in. It costs nothing and you can get a quick look. You should be about 97%. If your under 90, you will have some clues as to what it could be. The bottom line, your not getting enough oxygen from your lungs to your brain and body.<br>  <br>  Next or Optionally, consider doing some self experimentation. Find a book or on the web some isometric exercises. These involve deep breathing and last only a minute. <br>  <br>  Keep track of how many times you yawn and when during the day. Then pull out your isometric exercises during that time frame and see if your yawning decreases. This could indicate you are not breathing right on your own and need to learn how to breath better. May sound silly but there is some medical literature that suggest this is a possibility.<br>  <br>  Finally, and this is a big one. Boost your glutathione. Some people on supplements have had lung function studies before and after and have drastically improved to the point they do not need to carry O2 bottles with them. Your lungs are one of the only parts that can actually absorb glutathione. However, it may be cheaper to use the oral version of the supplements. <br>  <br>  This will help on several levels. In addition to helping the lungs, it will help with your blood if your anemic. It will help with neurological problems too if that is the cause. <br>  <br>  At the least, improve your diet so that your getting as much cysteine as you can.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Good health to you.|`|kzExKMQmaa	You are bored.|`|1dzzgaGZaa	i was tired and yawning all the time before i went to the doc and got a blood test. turns out my iron levels were abnormally low, which was causing the tiredness. now i take iron supplements and feel a lot better, try it out, you might have the same thing.|`|0FhWoWKRaa	You just need to sleep more, not longer! i.e take short naps now and again, just lie down to relax and dont eat at lunch.. take a small snack instead and drink green tea.|`|CrZxYK5raa	get more sleep!

UGIV0fxgaa	Sounds like mild anxiety.<br>  Panic Attacks, more often than not, are caused by subconscious thoughts and feelings.<br>  They start with sweats or shivers, and a hot, pins and needles trype feeling on your skin. Feeling self conscious probably begins it, then as you feel the sensations on your skin you start to worry that people are looking at your skin. This adds to the anxiety attack.<br>  <br>  It's all about changing your perspective - you have to feel happy with yourself. Do whatever it takes.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|3MM64geHaa	Cannabis can lead to anxiety and even psychotic breaks but I doubt that is what is going on and it may have nothing to do with your skin.  Some people get claustrophobic in bars.  Avoid caffeine and limit nicotein if you are going out.  Do something relaxing before you go out.  When you get there pay attention where the exits are so that you can know that you are not trapped. When you feel anxious, step outside for fresh air. Try tapping under your eye for about a minute and see if that helps.

Cut the amount of junk you eat, and exercise more... <br>  <br>  As you are only 13 i am not going to say, Don't eat junk food, but balance it with healthy stuff and limit the amount of junk you eat... <br>  So only have one slice of pizza not 2, only have one Chocolate bar a day, not 2/3. <br>  Fill up on good / healthy food...brown bread, Rice, Pasta ( Whole grain pasta is better, but white pasta ok) Lean meats (not Salami or mince meat), trim visible fat off meats and  Eat more pulses and more obvious lots of fruit and veg...<br>  <br>  Pasta and rice will fill you up much better than a McDonalds will!!!!<br>  <br>  Also drink water or sugar free juice etc... Limit the amout of fizzy drink you drink - say only one glass a day, not 3/4 glasses. <br>  <br>  Lastly exercise... Walk the dog, jog round the block, run up and down the stairs everytime there is an advert on the TV.. (i did the running up and down the stairs... ) swim for 20 minutes. jump on a trampoline... lots of fun ways to exercise. <br>  <br>  Lots of ways to lose weight, but common sense is the best way ..

I would think that u would first have to meet a certain criteria regarding ur general health, weight and other mental issues.

The same thing applies for OP. Although, your B.M.I does not have to be so slow for that. Although, in the majority of cases, they wont do that. They are more likely to recommend./suggest things rather then forcing you do anything you are even remotely uncomfortable with. I think you should consider getting help though. Anorexia is horrible.

cJRFbZUaaa	Your body adjusts to lost sleep by making you extra sleepy, forcing you to doze off.  That's how people end up asleep while driving.|`|di4yVFRraa	You don't need to "make up" the sleep, but you should find time for a night where you can sleep as long as you need to, rather than when you have a specific time you need to get up. When your body doesn't get sleep for a few days, it doesn't do all of the neat stuff your body is supposed to do while you sleep. It can catch up on these things pretty quickly, though. You may need an extra hour or two of sleep rather than making up 8. Additionally, depending on your age, you may not need 8 hours or sleep... or you may need more. Sleep until you wake up feeling refreshed. If you make up because you need to go to the bathroom or drink a glass of water, consider trying to go back to sleep because your body may have woken up to deal with those issues rather than because you were actually well-rested.
ParFJxnSaa	See stress treatments, at ezy build, below, in section 42. A certain level of stress is unavoidable, in modern society, so it is a good idea to develop effective coping methods. Light to moderate daily exercise helps fight stress. For some people, it helps to visualise a quiet, relaxing scene (imagine, as vividly as you can, that you are on a tropical beach, reclining comfortably; you luxuriate, as the the sun warms you, and a gentle breeze caresses your skin lightly, inhaling the tangy, sea scented, salt laden spray from the sparkling, translucent, aqua waves, crashing on the white, coral beach sand, and feeling the hot sand slip through your fingers in one hand, sipping your favorite drink with the other; all the while, the seagulls call, swoop and cavort playfully overhead in a cloudless, azure sky: you feel just like one of them, free to soar and cartwheel, or just glide in the moist, heavy air, and that this moment will last forever ... ). <br>  <br>  Options: Try: <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meditat..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meditat...</a>  & <a href="http://www.healthjourneys.com/free_audio.asp?f=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthjourneys.com/free_audio...</a> & <a href="http://www.meditainment.com/free-meditation-content/" rel="nofollow">http://www.meditainment.com/free-meditat...</a> & <a href="http://www.freehypnosistreatment.com/hypnosistreatment.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.freehypnosistreatment.com/hyp...</a>  Relaxation Hypnosis  Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. The supplement DHEA is thought to counter the stress hormone, Cortisol. Ginseng & Lady's Slipper are recommended herbal remedies: see section 55, at ezy build, below. Practise daily, one of the relaxation techniques in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i; whichever works best for you, but the mindfulness breathing for 15 - 20 mns is ideal, although the progressive muscle relaxation can be learned quickly, and takes only several minutes, if pressed for time.

Employ the EFT version for use in public, for which you can reasonably claim that you have a headache, as you massage/tap your temples, but it may be advisable to restrict yourself to subvocalising (saying it to yourself, in your mind, not aloud).

Since it's skim milk, there's a negligible amount of fat.  Those calories calculate out to 2 points (same as a glass of milk), especially since there's no fiber in the drink.<br>  There's no mystery to the points system.  There is actually a mathematical formula to it that takes into account calories, fat, and fiber (fiber detracting slightly from the final point value).  A good rough guideline is 1 point per 50 calories.  I've found this to be generally true (although not without exception).

eQCsKq4jaa	I am not completely sure. Your symptoms are all over the place.<br>  <br>  You must get a full blood workup (CBC, Basic Metabolic Panel and so on)<br>  <br>  If you have not, have an MRI of your lower back (lumbar region)- might show something. A herniated disk, degenerative disk disease are causes. A disk can touch your sciatic nerve and that will cause leg pain, spasms, and cramping. If the pain is only on one side I think a disk problem is likely the issue.<br>  <br>  And I would be taking (if you are not) pain meds. Narcotics- I can't say, I do not know exactly how bad it is (but Tramadol might be fine), a NSAID (Toradol and Ketaprofene are great), and a muscle relaxer. If you happen to live out side fo the US, Ketaprofene gel is available in most places and is very good. <br>  <br>  And as another person said, it could be Restless legs syndrome<br>  (RLS) but it is very rare for RLS to actually cause extreme pain (but it can happen).

WgNDtbS0aa	1) For a short time, I attended a monthly meeting made up of people who either had cancer, or were cancer survivors. I was there in hopes of offering a complementary approach IF anyone were interested. I kept my mouth shut initially, trying to get a feel for the groups existing opinions about complementary therapies. Once I was able to start asking about everyone's experience with complementary therapies, NONE of them had direct experience to form their opinions. Yet, they all had a 'story' of someone's brother, or sister-in-law, or whomever, that had tried a nutritional approach, or had gone to Mexico, or had tried some alternative approach, yet the person had died anyway. This was sufficient for them to look only to allopathic medicine. (Can I mention the number of them that showed up eating fast food? None of them juiced or thought nutrition was a valid method of healing.)<br>  <br>  2) When a friend's mother was diagnosed with cancer, I had a number of recommendations for her. "Well," my friend said, "my mother is going to try radiation first. She doesn't want to do anything, or take anything that will interfere with the treatment. But, maybe later..."<br>  <br>  I've heard that response numerous times.<br>  <br>  3) A friend wrote to me, frantic that her sister-in-law had been diagnosed with cancer. Once again, I put together a group of very beneficial recommendations. Some time later I asked my friend how her sister-in-law was doing. "Oh, she decided to try taking large amounts of Vit. C".<br>  <br>  Ah, I see. She obviously doesn't value her life too much. She didn't want to change anything else and took the easiest suggestion I had. I don't personally value the Vit. C suggestion a lot. I consider an adjunct therapy. But, I know a lot of people who would grab that option because its much easier than changing their lifestyle.<br>  <br>  For anyone who wants to learn the history of the demise of alternative therapies, read "When Healing Becomes a Crime". (see reference).|`|LMoJl7hFaa	The US for some reason has opted to use the current medical profession status as the only type of healing.   This is not true for many parts of the world.   Medicine currently uses drugs and surgery. I found that that is emergency handling for health conditions that have gone on too long and are life threatening.  <br>  <br>  I have a negative view of medicine due to bad experiences myself as well as my parents.  However, I have done really well on so called "alternative methods".|`|0YTuN71aaa	I'm a sceptic when it comes to certain alternative medicine treatments.  Mostly it's because many of those treatments are not proven to work.  It bothers me that there are people out there taking advantage of the emotionally vulnerable patients.

rHrr7zmVaa	Yes, you're a good height. My height is 5'7 and 18.|`|8Xbc4ok1aa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth .

fAFXkikAaa	Your gynecologist has no idea what she is talking about.  Please find another gynecologist.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as being "exposed" to herpes.   You either have it, or you don''t.   If your blood test was positive for the HSV2 virus, then you have HSV2.   <br>  <br>  You might want to take a hard look at both sets of test results yourself.  You most likely got the "HerpesSelect" test, and you can find interpretations of the test on the web.   I think that anything over about a 1.0 means a positive test, but it could be a 10.0.  Look it up.<br>  <br>  Some other bits of misinformation floating around:<br>  <br>  You can spread the herpes virus, even though you don't show symptoms.<br>  <br>  Most people with herpes don't show symptoms and don't know that they have it.   And many people don't show any symptoms, even though they can still spread the virus to others.<br>  <br>  Because you found out through a blood test, you know THAT you have HSV2 but not WHERE you have it.  You could have it orally.j<br>  <br>  Condoms don't protect well against herpes.<br>  <br>  The most important thing is never EVER to have sex when you have symptoms.   As long as you don't, your chance of spreading the virus is rather small - studies with committed couples show its about 5% per year.<br>  <br>  Antiviral drugs are primarily given to prevent outbreaks.  You don't have outbreaks.   So your doctor was correct in not giving you medication.<br>  <br>  My advice is to seek out another gyn.  Or better yet, go to planned parenthood or a GUM clinic or some other clinic that deals with a LOT of STDs.   Get retested by someone you can trust.   And ask them a ton of  questions.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn more about genital herpes, I recommmend the website below.

I have HSV2 and so does my boyfriend. Both of our exes spread the virus to us by cheating. He has no symptoms. No sores, pain, or itchiness. I have a very active strain of herpes and have about 2 outbreaks a month. He had to get a blood test taken to get positively diagnosed and all I had to do was see my gynecologist. I have to take once daily valtrex and he doesn't have to take anything. You should check with a second opinion, and get another blood test done. In the meantime, be safe, just in case. Good luck!|`|3uI0JAAwaa	You should go get a third opinion.  I would just go to a Kelsey Seebold clinic, or something like that.  In the mean-time, you should always use a condom, regardless.

Please be safe.|`|yhfVbNJcaa	wow you really have been through it...you have to get tested again.<br>  condoms DO NOT PROTECT AGAINST HERPES as any exposed skin will still pass the virus on.

IKakoOfyaa	Both hospital- and community-associated strains of MRSA still respond to certain medications. In hospitals and care facilities, doctors often rely on the antibiotic vancomycin to treat resistant germs. CA-MRSA may be treated with vancomycin or other antibiotics that have proved effective against particular strains. Although vancomycin saves lives, it may become less effective as well. Some hospitals are already seeing strains of MRSA that are less easily killed by vancomycin.  So yes, in some cases, it's curable.  In other cases, no.

Next topical step is a prescribed local antibiotic preparation.|`|392052a3dbd6d94cc65100310f44fccfaa	I had acne for a while and went to the doctor which prescribed me something made especially for my face,and some other expensive creams.Guess what,it DIDN'T work,got it even worse.And then,i;d keep seeing this stuff such as creams on TV commercials and thought to myself:"Ok,why should i use a cream that contains a dozen other chemicals and only a little H2O,so they say,to "hydrate" my skin,when i can use water dirrectly on my skin for that.Why would i use a cream which contains green tea extracts,when i can actually buy real green tea and boil it for tea and then either use it warm on my face or make ice cubes out of it(for my face,of course).So,i cut it short on the chemicals.The point of all this is:Use the least chemicals possible.So,the only cream that actually helped me with my skin was Echinaceea cream(that's a plant)...and i started doing warm concentrated green tea compressions,mineral water face compressions(and i say mineral,not plain),yogurt masks or sour cream.Also,to get rid of impurities,honey.And to firm the skin up, conentrated green tea ice cubes.And,healthy diet with lots of veggies and fruits,orange juice every day(all home made),lots of grapes and so on.No make up.Only eyes,if really want to,but no blush,no face foundation,NOTHING.Cereal and/with milk,every day.Also,virgin olive oil(for skin).Vitamin E (oil form) out of wheat germs and Omega 3 fats out of fish, under oil form too.Eggs in the morning,half boiled(to eat,not for face).Also,the vit E i was talking about above is to swallow.Do NOT apply anything that contains a lot of E vit. dirrectly on face skin,that will only accelerate the aging of your skin.You are what you eat,and beauty literally comes from INSIDE OUT.So,whatever you eat,will show on your face.The Omega 3,Wheat germs (vit E),half boiled eggs,(vit A),Grapes,Milk,Anything green colored (that is veggies and fruits),virgin oil,all help with maintaining good skin condition and good collagen production and elastin production in the skin.The zits will go away with all that stuff i said you should apply on your face.Don't use any soaps,wash your face with baby shampoo,because it cleanses and it's also mild for the skin.Don't use any face creams,whatever those would be.If  it's strong sun where you are,wear kid's sunscreen 50+ and stay away from sun(sun worsens acne).Honey's good for peeling,getting rid of black spots and such.And make sure to hydrate your skin with mineral water and drink plain water 2,5-3 lts a day.Avoid sodas,milkshakes and crap like that.Also,don't drink anything that is "natural juice",sinc ethey too contain additives.The only natural juices you should drink should be made at your own home.Don't forget to eat or drink home made Orange juices,as they also help with skin and keeping it young.Avoid junk food and unhealthy snacks at all costs if you want to be healthy.<br>  <br>  That's how i got rid of all my skin problems.Now i've got baby skin and i'm really happy with it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped.|`|cFYn5GOAaa	Hi there<br>  <br>  Depending on why type you are referring to because every day random spots, or if you are in your teens etc, it normally settles down and a simple topical ointment normally calms the inflammation etc. But if its serious acne that is solid ball type spots, that are red and very inflamed and very sore and normally there are loads.<br>  When i came off the contraceptive pill, that's what i got.

ufgv7oTjaa	Well, there's a couple things to mention about this. First and foremost, 12-13 mg of Iodine is a very high level unless you are severely deficient... the RDA is 150 mcg (that's 0.15 mg). Many Americans get more than enough Iodine from their diets because of all the Iodized salts that are used in the processed foods that are a part of our diets.<br>  The second thing to mention is that the Lugol's Solution is listed and measured in liquid form (mL) which is a measurement of volume, not of weight. Most commonly in Chemistry, 1 mL is about 1 gram (with water, which this is close to), so if you had 1 mL of Lugols at 2% solution, that would be 20 mg of Iodine... so 0.6 mL should be around 12 mg of Iodine.<br>  <br>  If you are taking that by a doctor's recommendations, you can check with them to see how long you should take that and/or how you could best measure that amount. You could also check with Lugols to see if they can tell you how many drops would make that amount from their dropper or if their droppers are marked for number of mL. Good luck and I hope I helped!

It is undetected until exam and if you have it long enough you will have bad cramps like your insides are falling out. It causes scar tissue that will block you tubes and when removed cause more tissue build up and makes you infertile. If you continue to have sex with nasty people you need to keep often appointments for the doctor. I could have beat the heck out my daughter when I told her that her only boyfriend was nasty and she was going to get something and she did not believe me until she was doubled over and could not drive herself to the doctor.
1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	You need to forgive yourself!!  You need to tell yourself that you did all that you could then, and back then you just couldn't stand up for yourself like you can now.  That is not uncommon either.  Too often we are more meek and docile in our younger years, and grow into our backbones.  <br>  <br>  WHAT DOES NOT KILL US MAKES US STRONGER.<br>  <br>  You are not weak, you are not inadequate; we all fall prey to the verbal and or physical abuses of others on some level in our lives.

I remember the breakthrough, there was so much crying, and pain. No WORDS PEOPLE could say helped ME. It is YOUR own words that can heal yourself. you tell yourself and think through if what you're doing to yourself is rational, at all. <br>  <br>  keep this in mind. People are stupid, you are not. this only goes to you btw. but no matter what I read, it just seemed there was no solution, I had to understand how others go through life, and it's not as great as i thought. the people who make it seem their life is perfect: the truth is, they're probably lying and it's annoying as hell, so I avoid them. make yourself a person.. it's ok to have something others dislike, it is totally fine to show yourself. I learned by looking at myself" how I came(my impression) to other people, people learn by looking at others. I walked around with very mean eyes and a frown, I looked like I was mad or angry at people.. it's basically self realization.<br>  <br>  the point in life is to be balanced too: I learned by watching my sister's depression, she became suicidal, got help.. on drugs, she became a 'psycho' with no feelings, because she thought it was her low self esteem(her own feelings) that damaged her. causing harm to herself even more and to others, she said she was going to kill me and wrote pages about it in detail on how I would die. <br>  <br>  some feelings are healthy, getting angry sometimes is okay. it was hard for me at first, everything was a chore. now balancing my life comes natural to me. I hope it does to you too in the future. i hope it much easier to cope. Apologies for my long answer. I hate reading long paragraphs myself##

rpnFxnCQaa	CP,<br>  <br>  I can relate to how you feel. I had anxiety attacks too. I was thinking too much. For me, that was when I had to speak in public. Or when there would be more than a few people around me in the same room. It was something that started when I was a teenager and that lasted over years and subsequently affected my career until not so long ago. <br>  <br>  At some point, I was prescribed medicine but like you, I wanted to avoid that because of the side effects. That's when I discovered a program that literally pulled me out of that "hole". It is a 100% natural method. <br>  So you may wanna try <a href="http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com</a> <br>  <br>  The KEY of that technique is that you should no longer fear the thought of anxiety. You know what I mean? You are thinking too much. You have to get out of that loop. <br>  Not only did that program cure me - you can become your true self again - but I was also extremely surprised to even discover newly built self-confidence.<br>  <br>  There is always a solution!

I have been on a medication that is used for anxiety that really doesn't have any side effects. The mediation is called Atarax. It is not a depression medication which is a lot of what doctors prescribe. what i like about it is that during an anxiety attack (panic attack) you can take more medication. It takes a while and a lot of coping mechanisms to deal with anxiety. The main thing is that you need to know what brings on the anxiety and also what helps to relax you. <br>  Good Luck!!|`|ukVNUgPFaa	i have anxiety and panic attacks and i have almost overcome them. i hate to be the bearer of bad news but those problems will never go away completely. try the medication lexapro, there were to adverse reactions with me and i was mellowed out without feeling tired or exhausted. try breathing when you are about to break with anxiety. when youre about to panic, stop take in a deep breath and then think of things that calm you, like the ocean, the smell of home cooking, kittens, whatever. your husband can also help with this. my fiance puts his hand on my back and makes small circles that eventually get bigger while he tells me he loves me and that everything will be okay. try this and please let me know if everything is okay. never accept xanax. its addictive and can mess you up if you want kids. good luck!!
MBknatYtaa	Someone has cancer and they are still smoking?|`|uzZuwtgXaa	Smoking is harmful no matter what way you look at it, cigarettes are full of chemicals, and carcinogens, and they must interfere with cell structure.

If begun within 48 hours of developing the flu, it can greatly reduce the length of time you are ill.  <br>  <br>  Full blown flu usually presents with fever, fatigue, chills, headache, body aches, chills, cough, sore throat, all increasing in severity as time passes.

I work for a contact lens company and order lenses all day long.  As you get older your eye generally do get worst.  You said your wearing a -675, I have seen people wearing a -1200.<br>  <br>  What is keratoconus?<br>  Keratoconus is a corneal disease that occurs when the normally round dome-shaped cornea (the clear outer area of the eye) progressively thins causing a cone-like bulge to develop. Typically diagnosed during adolescence and early adulthood with a variable rate of progression. <br>  <br>  The bulging or “cone-shaped” protrusion is caused by the normal pressure of the eye pushing out on the thinned areas of the cornea. Since the cornea is responsible for refracting most of the light coming into your eye, an abnormal-shaped cornea can create reduced visual acuity and affect the way you see. This reduced visual acuity can make even simple daily tasks, such as driving, watching television or reading, difficult to perform.<br>  <br>  The actual cause of keratoconus is not yet known, but there have been studies to suggest a genetic and inherited link to the disease. Recent statistics estimate an incidence of greater than 1 in 1,000 based on computerized corneal topography, pachymetry, and higher-order aberrations. The condition affects male and female in equal proportion and occurs in both eyes in 90% of patients.<br>  <br>  Prior to use of corneal collagen cross-linking 10% of keratoconus patients required a corneal transplant.

IMu3wBu8aa	I've hit rock bottom twice. I kept pulling through because of Wrestling. I always believed that there was something better than my horrible life. I always knew I was on the right track, it was just very hard getting to the places I wanted in life. Just hold on and believe. I did. If I didn't hold on...I would have never met the man of my dreams. Now, he will be there for me and I will be there for him. Could you have imagined if I brokedown and lost it...I would have never been this happy. One day I was dreaming of my future, Wrestling, the right man, and how things would play out...now it's not a dream anymore. It took long, because I made it that way. If I went with the flow and didn't let so much stuff eat me alive...I would have been happier longer than just now. People have this mindset where everything needs to be rushed (or I did). So things were so hard. I made things far worse then they could have been. If you move on, not let things bother you...things will change for you. Change is the key word. Just hang in there and find something to believe in to carry you through it. Find a passion and work at it. Don't let things get to you. I always played the victim role, because for so long I was one. Then I was slowly killing myself mentally from it. Everything to me was so negative and never saw a positive side to anything. I always still had that gut feeling, that hope left in me that kept me going. Wrestling kept it there. So just try to breathe and realize things will come when they are meant to come. Hell, tomorrow a dream of yours could come true and change your life forever. If it doesn't, just wait it out. Change your life for the better. Good Luck. I'm always here to talk. Message me whenever you want to talk. =)|`|N70ZEHTyaa	Prevention of Mental Illness<br>  <br>  Anyone can have a mental illness, regardless of age, gender, race, or income. Mental illnesses are more common than cancer, diabetes, heart disease, or AIDS. It is believed that one in five adults and children has a diagnosable mental disorder, one in every 10 young people age 9 or older has a serious emotional disturbance that severely disrupts daily life.and one in four families will have a member with mental illness. Children who develop depression often have a family history of the illness, many times a parent who had depression at an early age. Untreated mental health problems can lead to suicide, which is the sixth leading cause of death for 5- to 14-year olds. An estimated two-thirds of all young people with mental health problems are not getting the help they need.It is important to remember that mental illness can occur at any age, but most people start experiencing symptoms for the first time between the ages of 25 and 44. With proper treatment, as many as 8 in 10 people suffering from a mental illness can return to normal, productive lives, and almost everyone receives some benefit from treatment.<br>  <br>  The causes of mental illness are complicated. Mental health disorders in children and adolescents are caused mostly by biology and environment. Examples of biological causes are genetics, chemical imbalances in the body caused by genetics, lack of sleep or poor nutrition, or damage to the central nervous system, such as a head injury or fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Many environmental factors also put young people at risk for  developing mental health disorders. Examples including exposure to environmental toxins, such as high levels of lead; exposure to violence, such as witnessing or being the victim of physical or sexual abuse, being the child of an addict or alcoholic, drive-by shootings, muggings, or other disasters; stress related to chronic poverty, discrimination, or other serious hardships; and the loss of important people through death, divorce, or broken relationships. <br>  <br>  The following  preventive services are recommended and can be carried out in a clinic, church, library or local community center:<br>  <br>  Prenatal and infancy home visits or support groups. <br>  Targeted cessation education and counseling for smokers, especially those who are pregnant. <br>  Targeted short-term mental health therapy. <br>  Self-care education for adults (i.e. exercise, nutrition, stress management, relationships and finances). <br>  Brief counseling and advice to reduce alcohol use. <br>  Mentoring programs for young children <br>  A variety of adult-supervised after-school and weekend activities<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  10 Tips for Mental Health      <br>     <br>     <br>   <br>   <br>   1. Build Confidence <br>  <br>  Identify your abilities and weaknesses together, accept them build on them and do the best with what you have. <br>  <br>  2. Eat right, Keep fit <br>  <br>  A balanced diet, exercise and rest can help you to reduce stress and enjoy life.<br>  <br>  3. Make Time for Family and Friends<br>  <br>  These relationships need to be nurtured; if taken for granted they will not be there to share life's joys and sorrows. <br>  <br>  4. Give and Accept Support <br>  <br>  Friends and family relationships thrive when they are "put to the test".<br>  <br>  5. Create a Meaningful Budget <br>  <br>  Financial problems cause stress. Over-spending on our "wants" instead of our "needs" is often the culprit. <br>  <br>  6. Volunteer<br>  <br>  Being involved in community gives a sense of purpose and satisfaction that paid work cannot. <br>  <br>  7. Manage Stress <br>  <br>  We all have stressors in our lives but learning how to deal with them when they threaten to overwhelm us will maintain our mental health. <br>  <br>  8. Find Strength in Numbers <br>  <br>  Sharing a problem with others who have had similar experiences may help you find a solution and will make you feel less isolated. <br>  <br>  9. Identify and Deal with Moods <br>  <br>  We all need to find safe and constructive ways to express our feelings of anger, sadness, joy and fear.<br>  <br>  10. Learn to Be at Peace with Yourself <br>  <br>  Get to know who you are, what makes you really happy, and learn to balance what you can and cannot change about yourself.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	I take it your saying you want to have the breakdown and just get it over and done with?<br>  Sorry it doesn't work that way.<br>  I understand how you feel as I got to the point where I was like Let's just get this over with already, then I can move on.<br>  I was always in a hurry to do things and this time I wasn't able to because my body and mind were in desperate need of rest and healing.<br>  I was (and still am) the kind of person that rushed through troubles, dealt with other peoples issues rather than dealing with my own, took on everyones emotional baggage, was the go to person in the family and never told anyone that the weight was too much. I was too scared that I would look weak to them.<br>  Finally I had a breakdown and I HAD TO LEARN TO TAKE TIME FOR ME. Little things like reading, writing in a journal, watching ALOT of WWE (I know it sounds corny, but it's what I love) I even learned to say NO and to just shut myself in my room for a few minutes if I needed time out.<br>  I spent 16 years caring for an aunt who recently went into a rest home full time. When she did I felt like my life was over, as my life had been caring for her. (I'm all of 36) <br>  So now I am learning to live a life that I want, but also learning that I have to allow myself to FEEL things, can't just rush through the emotions anymore.<br>  <br>  If you need to talk or just want to vent (I know that helps!) you can e mail me anytime. <br>  You should also seek medical help as your falling may not be a symptom of a breakdown, it could be something else.///<br>  Good Luck to you!|`|cSqx1DxKaa	You DO want to prevent a breakdown, or you don't?  I am confused.|`|SkDomhoXaa	?|`|8pQrIL90aa	Life has been hard for me, and I have almost had some breakdowns but I believe that God has held me because I dont know how I made it through some of the madness that came upon my life, it was truly the Lord. <br>  <br>  I am not working right now and I often get upset that I have a child and I am not able to go to school or be in the comfort of my own home. I sometimes get very highly anxious and I cannot seem to focus. <br>  <br>  I have learned that if you cannot do something to change the situation, dont strugle against it. Let it be. Place it in prayer and let God work it out. I also take fish oil pills which are proven to reduce stress and depression. I stay away from alot of pills, but I get up and go out and work out, do some running and I just try to stay happy knowing that things are going to change.<br>  <br>  Nothing is worth you losing your mind. If you have faith, please get into the bible and seek out God in your life, do it now and you will know him as a grown man. People have alot of bad things to say about the bible, I can only say dont believe them. It takes time to know God. But he will help you out. Its not going to be easy, but in the end you will be fitted with armor that will always keep you standing strong.<br>  <br>  You are young and strong, but now you need that spiritual strength that will make you complete. Also I find that doing things for others takes our minds away from our own lives. We are really meant to be servants to one another in this world. Its not a very "nice" place to live.<br>  <br>  Live simple, be stellar in what you do and know that you are here for a purpose. Seek god and in time you will know that purpose for your life.

T1ffrjHAaa	Keep between 1400 - 1500 calories per day and watch your eating times, best is "little and often" (every 2 - 3 hours). Remember that muscle is heavier than fat also. You may also find that if you crash dieted and lost weight quickly that your body metabolism is now slowed down as it retains more of what you put in because of the shock of losing so much too quickly.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	You're probably over eating. Stay below 1500 calories if you plan to lose weight. and exercise an hour a day 5 times a week, every week|`|O4VrWvoQaa	could this be muscle? <br>  haha @ georgie!|`|t81MEJ82aa	You haven't provided any details so it's hard to say what is wrong exactly. Sometimes people think they are eating healthy, but they actually aren't. People also think that starving themselves is the way to go but can ultimately cause you to lose weight slower. Also it matters when and how often you eat just as much as what you eat. Also muscle weighs more than fat. Being that you weren't exercising regularly before, muscle is easier to build than burning fat off so you might be adding muscle quicker than you are getting rid of the fat.<br>  <br>  While the scale might not look the way you want, you can absolutely tell if you are less fat. I don't know if you are even overweight to begin with, but if you are very overweight (obese) then you should buy a measuring tape to measure your waist, chest, and hips. It's possible to gain or maintain a steady weight but to have smaller measurements, which is a good thing.|`|1eafc7d2745d873056abda89fd644203aa	don't stop!  the initial muscle you put on might slightly increase your weight temporarily, but over time your body will get rid of the excess fat and keep the muscle..  tone women look very good!  don't worry about the weight for now..  just go by what you see in the mirror.

I personally find it hard to strictly eat always healthy and of the correct amounts so I increase my cardio and weights to make calories burnt higher than calories in. I eat a lot but I exercise even more so I am loosing weight. <br>  <br>  The formula can not fail only you can fail the formula. <br>  <br>  This formula is bullet proof, if you want to test it, count how many calories you eat in a week and how many you burn. There is no way you are putting on weight if you are in line with the formula.|`|AwpSwwcfaa	The first thing that you are doing wrong, is you are probably weighing yourself every day... You should only weigh yourself (at the most) once a week! You should use the way that your clothes fit as a guide... If you are gaining weight, but your clothes are fitting better and more loosely... Then the weight you are gaining is muscle! That is a good thing because muscle burns more fat than fat does! Keep up the work and I am sure that you get to where you want to be!!! :-)|`|1JsWMX0daa	muscle weighs more than fat. you could be putting on muscle, NOT fat. OR your new eating habits have slowed down your metabolism. chances are it's the first thing i mentioned. especially if you are starting to weigh more than you look. ask some people how much they think you weigh. if they are guessing, for example,  100-120 when you weigh 140-160, than you are doin great! don't get discouraged. good luck.|`|0uvcUV8Zaa	That happens to me too.<br>  <br>  Drinking lots of water makes your weight fluctuate greatly through the day.

AA11987492	Uncircumcised, circed penises are like fake boobs, good, but never as good as the real thing.<br>  <br>  These are some links about how male circumcision affects the female<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.healthcentral.com/drdean/408/60750.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthcentral.com/drdean/408/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.healthcentral.com/drdean/408/8812.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthcentral.com/drdean/408/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/116-1181/595/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nzma.org.nz/journal/116-1181/...</a>|`|TsjqzanQaa	Perhaps you would consider it more of a big deal if someone had circumcised you, a female circumcision, as an infant, permanently mutilating, scarring and depriving you of sexual sensitivity.<br>  <br>  Female circumcision of minors is illegal in the US, as all civilized countries (execpt Sudan, which just legalized it about a month ago).       It is universally considered genital mutilation.<br>  <br>  Male circumcision is male genital mutilation, which always damages the penis and sexual sensitivity.<br>  <br>  Circumcised males almost never have a choice in the matter; it's forced on them as infants, when they can't choose, nor defend themselves against this assault.<br>  <br>  Very, very few uncircumcised adult males ever choose to be mutilated by circumcision.     The very few that do are usually talked into it by doctors, or else they believe that there is some benefit to being circumcised because of the old wive's tales and outright lies about the so-called benefits.<br>  <br>  The HIV rate is much higher among circumcised males, and it's attributed to the fact that the foreskin has antiviral and antibacterial properties.    In the US, with its high circumcision rate, the HIV rates are invariably much higher than in the countries of Europe, Scandinavia, South America and Asia, where circumcision is rarely done.<br>  <br>  In Pakistan, for example, where 90% of males are circumcised, the HIV rate is 400% more than in India, where the vast majority of males are uncircumcised and unmutilated.<br>  <br>  You "personally like circumcised"---but noone tried to cut part of YOUR body off of you without your consent.<br>  <br>  I was a victim of male genital mutilation, called circumcision.<br>  <br>  As an infant, I was tied down, assaulted, sexually molested and mutilated by the process called circumcision.<br>  <br>  The damage resulting from this attack on my person caused damage that made it impossible for me to achieve orgasm in normal sex.<br>  <br>  I found out about foreskin restoration, and this has vastly improved my sexual sensitivity and function, and also increased the intensity of orgasm, as well.<br>  <br>  While I have improved my penis, more like nature intended, it will never be the same as if I had been left unmutilated.<br>  <br>  It may not be a big deal to you, but it certainly is to ME!<br>  <br>  Attacking and mutilating male infants who can't defend themselves is an atrocity, and it should be illegal, as female mutilation of minors is.<br>  <br>  Isn't it sexist in the extreme and unconstitutional as such to have a law protecting one sex from mutilation, and yet allowing the other to be mutilated?<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|zOIgzIy4aa	i never been circumsized but i heard that you lose your sensitivity in that area if the skin is,nt there.|`|7q9MN1Wkaa	There's a lot of debate over health/hygiene benefits of circumcision. Of all that I've read, it seems that there is no measurable benefit for the procedure. So I'm just gonna stick to subjective ratings.......<br>  <br>  Looks-wise, circumcised is better (except if the scar is really big & jagged). Most foreskins are kind of ugly or silly-looking. But I would go with Uncut over a crappy circumcision. Penises aren't very pretty in general, so the way it looks is not that important. More important is how it functions:<br>  <br>  Foreskin is better for sex & handjobs (easier & more fun to play with). Sex with some cut penises can chaff, especially if u are a little dry! OUCH! The extra skin also acts like a ribbed condom, more ridges to feel. Some chicks say they can't tell the difference btwn cut & uncut for sex, but I can. Some guys may have a thin foreskin, so that may explain it. My BF has a thick one, so it definitely FEELS nicer than other cut guys I've had. With a condom, it's less noticeable.<br>  <br>  Now, for oral, circumcised is the winner. Foreskins feel kinda weird & mushy in the mouth & they have a stronger smell. Unless the guy has JUST stepped out of the shower, I can always detect that "smegma-ish" scent. Not too say that it's horrible or anything, 'coz women's privates smell even stronger. But I HAVE been with both varieties who had less than perfect hygiene & I can tell u........I almost got turned-off foreskin for LIFE. The cut guy still smelled bad, but nowhere NEAR the uncut one!<br>  <br>  So, fellas, pls keep those turtle-necks clean!!|`|pzLDXL6gaa	The controversy is over whether it's right to do it to infants or not. Becuase it's mostly cosmetic, people are discussing whether it's right to put an adult's personal sexual preferneces onto an infant's genitals, and whether there are any medical benefits. I think it shouldn't be done to babies because they don't get a choice, the benefits have never been proven, and they are too young for cosmetic surgery.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|i6RlYFo7aa	neither is cleaner or better than the other<br>  but an uncircumcised penis is the way a penis should be|`|E64juLwJaa	Better not be circumcised:you loose a lot of sensitivity<br>  Planets..|`|a454ee46524abf792eec0686abd82584aa	Since its introduction into the west as an anti-masturbation measure in the 19th century, circumcision proponents have trotted out endlessly changing justifications for the procedure, as earlier ones are disproved. Most of these proposed reasons have later been proved to be based on flawed studies but the myths continue. Even if the claims for benefit were accepted the level of any protection from disease is so low as to be easily outweighed by the risks involved in the surgery. A few babies even die each year from circumcision complications and some lose their penis from necrotic infection. More common complications of infant circumcision, like skin bridges or too much skin removed, do not show up until much later in life. So the statistics do not include them in the complication rate. (A penis with a skin bridge is much harder to clean and causes major sexual difficulties.) However even on these artificially lowered statistics all the major medical authorities in the world now say that these risks outweigh the dubious benefits of routine infant circumcision.<br>  <br>  Circumcision removes over half the skin of the penis (about 15 square inches or 40 square centimetres, in an adult) and it's not just simple skin. It's packed with nerve endings, special anatomical features like the ridged band and has a unique elastic gliding action, allowing it to slide on itself and act like lube. This action is what most males use to masturbate with. Circumcised males use what skin they have left, except those who are cut so tightly that they have to use lube or just rub it dry. The intact male can stroke the entire length of his penis using his foreskin and also has the option to use lube too, if he wants to. During intercourse the foreskin acts like lube on entry and may act as a dam, preventing lubricating secretions escaping from the vagina. In one study women reported that sex with an intact partner was gentler and more satisfying since he doesn't have to thrust as hard to feel enough stimulation. Removing the foreskin turns the surface of the glans from an inner mucosal membrane to outside skin. Newly circumcised adults usually go through some weeks of intense discomfort as the glans is constantly exposed to rubbing on clothing, until it develops a thicker keratin layer and becomes less sensitive. A recent study has shown real differences in fine touch sensitivity between circumcised and intact penises and that the most sensitive parts of the intact penis are those that would be removed by circumcision.<br>  <br>  Another very recent study in New Zealand followed a cohort of boys through life from birth to age 32. About 40% were circumcised. The intact males had a slightly lower rate of sexually transmitted infections than the circumcised but there was no significant difference.<br>  <br>  A few intact males have problems with tight foreskin but this is only a tiny proportion of intact males. The condition can now be almost always treated with simple stretching exercises, sometimes in combination with a steroid cream that speeds up the process. However doctors who do not value the preservation of the foreskin often still trot out circumcision as a first-option treatment in the US and even some other countries.<br>  <br>  I myself am circumcised. I have hated it ever since as a 12 year old I saw a mate masturbating with a foreskin and realised a little of what I had lost.Many men resent being circumcised, some so much that they stretch to try and regain some of their lost foreskin's function. They can never recover all the complex anatomy and lost nerve endings though. Infant circumcision is a violation of a man's right to intact genitals and I will never forgive my parents and the medical profession for doing it to me.<br>  Geoff|`|tVfkiFAvaa	I'm confused.

Just follow you're daily calorie need. There are websites out there that will determine that for you. They will ask for you're age, height, and activity.

The two drugs may act synergistically and cause odd sensations at the site of injection though due to them both being vasoconstrictors (decrease blood flow.) <br>  <br>  My guess is that you are "having a couple beers" to take the edge off of anxiety that is sometimes experienced before going to the dentist's office.

But most of the time, a little bit of freakiness is actually a lot healthier than repression.|`|ceb725ef22a506f2eff0cfbb8d0e6e96aa	STUPID!!!!

Rk46lIBwaa	There should be no problem with the overlap, though it is unnecessary.|`|lj47k4A1aa	I believe so yeah.  I'm always shocked more girls dont get the coil, its actually a god send!|`|DtG4zpM2aa	Best to make an appointment fairly soon to chat through this with your GP or family planning services.  Sometimes they prefer to insert the IUD when you are having your period as the cervix is slightly dilated, making insertion easier, and it eliminates any possibility of pregnancy as well, which is a relevant factor for some women, though less so for you if you've been on the contraceptive injection, obviously!   But having a slight overlap in terms of when the next injection would be due shouldn't be a problem...if anything, it's good to allow a bit of time for everything to get organized as it may take a week or two for a suitable appointment time to be arranged.

CciXZNYraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  ? Avoid those vending machines by carrying around your own healthful foods and leaving pocket change at home.<br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6NZeItMAaa	One reason why most diets fail is because we are used to have some foods that fulfill our needs for sweet. First of these foods is often chocolate. Chocolate fights depression and give us a peaceful sensation almost immediately. It’s rich in minerals and vitamins but very caloric. The chocolate diet includes some controlled absorptions during the day that will help you to have that delicious feeling and lose weight at the same time.<br>  <br>  There is no question here of taking chocolate, pasta and pop corns every day but of healthy balanced menus for two weeks containing an unstopping variety of foods: dairy products, fruits and vegetables, starchy foods, meat and fish, etc.<br>  <br>  The principle is to play on the light but by agreeing chocolate and a small pleasure sometimes to hold over the duration and not to feel frustrations. It promises between 2 and 6 pounds a week according to the weight to lose.|`|iTYVV3etaa	Hey, try the Master Cleanse Diet!<br>  <br>  My mom followed the diet for 8-days and she lost 17 lbs!<br>   <br>  Even celebrities did it:<br>  The singer/actress Beyonce did it for 14 days and she lost 20-22 lbs!

lnnwXsdsaa	I had a full tummy tuck almost 5 months ago. I would say, if you have the time, the money, and the help. Do it!   I am so glad I did it! I went to Hawaii last month and wore a bikini the whole time! I was not affraid to take off my shirt!!!   <br>        The surgery.... I handle pain well (had my first son natural with no epidural and didn't shed a tear) so I don't know if it would be accurate for me to say that it wasn't all that painful. The only reason though, that I say I would NEVER have a voluntary surgery again, is the anesthesia. I did not like it AT ALL. I went into the operating room, they had me lay on the table, put the mask on me, I breathed in a couple times, and I went to sleep. Waking up was the worst thing ever! I remember sleeping and hearing the nurse telling me to wake up and I couldn't open my eyes! I was so tired, I couldn't open my eyes, or talk, or anything. My fiance was there, but I didn't even know. I remember not breathing, and thinking to myself that I am not breathing. Then all of a sudden I heard my fiance say "hunny breathe."  And I took a huge breathe, and that happened a few times. It was scary, but the nurses didn't seem concerned about it. after I woke up enough to breathe, that is just about all I could do. My body was heavy. It took me a good 3-4 hours to be able to eat a couple bites of applesause and take some pain pills, then get dressed. THAT was a chore! haha. After that I went home. I slept the whole drive home, walked up the stairs by myself at home and laid down on the couch and slept the rest of the day. After the first day, everything went really smooth. I never had to much pain, it was more like I was just really sore.... like I did a million sit ups.  But I was able to sit and stand on my own, walk around the house, and stuff like that.  After about 4 days I was really up and about. I tagged along with my fiance to the grocery store on day 4. I had to walk slow and hold onto the cart for support, but otherwise was fine.  after 2 weeks, I was picking up my one year old daughter (carefully) and after about a month I would say I was 100% back to my normal daily routine (I'm a stay at home mom). I wore my binder almost everyday until I went to Hawaii at 3 months post op.  I haven't worn it since then and I feel great!   Good Luck! if you have any questions, feel free to email me!|`|hXYjkCGpaa	Here's some information that will might clear things up: <a href="http://best-cosmetic-surgeries.com/the-popularity-of-cosmetic-surgeries/tummy-tuck-surgery" rel="nofollow">http://best-cosmetic-surgeries.com/the-p...</a>|`|UdU7E5MIaa	I've never had a tummy tuck but having had 2 c-sections I figure it must be somewhat similar in recovery time and pain.  IT HURTS!!!  You can't bend, you can't drive for 6 weeks, you will have pain around the incision, it will itch like crazy as it heals, you can't lift anything.  And if you are cursed like me to get a cold during healing time, it hurts like hell to cough or sneeze.  <br>  <br>  Go for it if that is what you really want, just remember:<br>  Beauty knows no pain.

CXwjdUgDaa	Thats a good question and i have the same problem sometimes<br>  when you are feeling hungry like that, what i always do is eat some grapes or an apple. Apples are great for you and really make you feel full.|`|5rJ6nf2oaa	You say you gain weight from eating too much, like all of us. This makes me wonder whether you are dieting incorrectly and consuming too few calories. No matter what your metabolism is like, your body will demand food if you are not getting enough. If you are consuming too few calories then this will be one reason why your metabolism is low, and it will be worse if you are not exercising regularly. <br>  <br>  If you don't burn off the calories you consume then fats will be stored in the body, but this doesn't mean you won't get hungy because once the fat is stored you would have to be starving, literally, before these stores are used if you don't raise your metabolic rate by regulating your diet and exercise.<br>  <br>  This is why when dieting you must consume enough calories from the correct type of food. <br>  <br>  If you would like an example of the correct type of foods to consume while trying to diet and lose weight then I have attached some reading below for your info. Hope this helps.

ReaD6u4paa	unfortunately most cases of cancer are diagnosed in their final stages.for example lung adenocarcinoma is asymtomatic because it occur in the peripheral part of the lung.thats why there is a campain avbout breast cancer because if it is diagnosed in its early stages it can be cured.one famous person who is know to have recovered from testicular cancer is Lance Amstrong.one symptom that is common to most cancers is rapid weight loss.it is often the symtom that hints about cancer.pulmonary cancers are very difficult to detect in early stages.when there is bronchopulmonary tumors then the patient might suffer from atelectasia or emphysema.and these are shown as irregular shape of the thorax and asyncronous(one rib goes up on respiration the other one does not go that up) expansion and relaxation of the rib cage.<br>  as i said eralier it is very difficult to detect cancer or tumors.tumors of the gastointestinal tract are a bit easier as the cause obstruction or bleeding.but then it has the same symtoms as other gastrointestinal problems (e.g ulcers).tumour markers are used to investigate the presence of a tumour<br>  cancer can be ROUGHLY classified in 3 stages.<br>  the last stage is when metastasis occers it means when the cancer cell distribute all over the body.<br>  about surgery...if there is no metastasis yet then the surgeon will remove the tumour.in most cases the patient undergoes radiotherapy to reduce th tumour size as it is much easier to operate with a smaller tumour.<br>  ihope i get 10 points :)|`|n7NgsKxlaa	well, cancer spreads through mitosis. with breast cancer they say if you examine your breast and feel a lump then you have it. i'm guessing it depends what cancer you have|`|AA10112244	If you need accurate info, I suggest you start with thew web site for the American Cancer society.

I just had a biopsy done on a lump, and it is not cancer.<br>  So, you are not going tog et very accurate answers here, obviously.|`|dZupmdBwaa	Patients will tyically come in with symptoms (pain, nausea, tiredness, weakness) or during routine annual physical the bloos tests will be abnormal. From there, all cancers are detected by radiology (CT, MRI, PET scans).

AA12279950	Ok.  In my personal opinion - no, it's too drastic and you're not big enough to warrant this surgery.  Yes, you're classed as obese with a bmi of over 30 but you're not morbidly obese, which is when this surgery is usually considered necessary.<br>  <br>  A little background on me to justify my reasoning - I'm 42, I'm shorter than you and have battled with my weight all my life.  A few years back I lost five and a half stone through sheer determination (and a little help from Xenical prescribed by my GP).  I now weigh less than 9 stone and have never felt better!<br>  <br>  Have you tried the Cambridge diet?  It's quite extreme but boy, does it work!  A dear friend of mine lost seven stone on it last year - the first five stone came off within three months.  She is 28 and now looks absolutely drop dead gorgeous!  I would strongly recommend you give it a go before resorting to surgery.  Just think - this time next year you could be less than 10 stone and wearing size 10 jeans - and your bank balance would be far healthier too!<br>  <br>  Why not try Xenical (ask your GP) or the Cambridge for six weeks and see how you go?  What have you got to lose by trying?  If you still feel the same way after the six weeks - by all means go for the surgery (I'd never critise anyone for going down this route) but I think it's worth exploring these two options first.<br>  <br>  Just one last thing - however you get there - you have to do it.

Instead of using that money on a quick fix, use it to get a personal trainer who will help you in your goal.<br>  Best of luck with whatever you decide :)|`|sYFfji1Naa	i might sound like a total ***** here but you havent tried everything because if you had your weight wouldnt be a problem. why turn to surgery for weight loss? its the easy way out, wouldnt you like to be proud of the fact that YOU lost the weight? i dont see how anyone could be proud of laying on an operating table and getting the problem fixed, its unnatural and unecesary. give up the junk, eat salads drink water and excersize! its not a hard thing to do!|`|aMEqiWvhaa	Why don't you in your spare time, if you have any do dog walking. Walking is the best exercise you can do, go far as you want and as fast as you want. Get fresh air and burn of the can I say it fat. Have fun. x|`|6k5fhFyBaa	Usually there is VERY stringent criteria to meet to be eligible for that service and have it covered by insurance. Just talk with your GP to see if that option is suitable for you. Your size is nowhere near morbidly obese which is normally part of the criteria.|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	you will not get a gastric band as you are not morbidly obese which is 100lbs over your normal weight you are around 6 stones overweight which is obese but not enough to get you a gastric band<br>  <br>  go and see you GP who can refer you to a dietician and may beale to put you on a course of slimming pills
ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|CXwjdUgDaa	Dont listen to that other guy you do not want to start taking pills at your age. trust me. watch this video and do it twice a day and with a good diet you will see results in about a week <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO1DctpRON4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO1DctpRO...</a><br>  thanks and good luck!|`|u8twtREdaa	You can go to you're local gym and you can go for a walk or a run .<br>  And eat veggies and fruit .<br>  But you should go to  the gym a lot or a huge walk or jog around the valley but if u live by the city or a busy town go to a valley and not the city or busy town.Or go to some thing in the gym.<br>  thank you|`|WlFIXJSeaa	Your in the right direction.  Stay away from sweets there are enough sugars in average food we consume daily thats enough.  Low calorie and fat diets are usually the best way because it supplies all the nutrients and isnt at all harmful balanced with exercise.  Good luck!|`|fdelyVYJaa	Read: 'How to eat less to lose weight and not to be hungry ' from<br>  <a href="http://yefimsanswers.blogspot.com/2009/01/how-to-eat-less-to-lose-weight-and-not.html" rel="nofollow">http://yefimsanswers.blogspot.com/2009/0...</a>
GfG6wupTaa	Wow! I've never heard that one before. I've been with alot of men in my lifetime, but that's a new one. Kind of gives you a reason to drink, don't it?|`|E64juLwJaa	Because you are you:I guess<br>  Most would not be like that at all.<br>  Planets.|`|LS2mF8u3aa	Because... You probably did take a Viagra.<br>  Or you slept with someone.<br>  <br>  Have fun paying child support.|`|QtomzqbXaa	... you are the luckiest person on the face of the earth.|`|kD8iggyCaa	Maybe you were horny?
OhkY8n7Yaa	You need to add more protein...try yo plait yogurt!!<br>  <br>  seriously or you will get sick!|`|RrzgS6eCaa	Be careful with the fruit salad. It could have a lot more sugar than you think.|`|WlFIXJSeaa	No it isnt enough for one day.  You need to consume at least 1200 calories a day for your body to even function properly.  Consuming under 1200 calories a day for women could be harmful.  Especially with an intense workout you should consume a few more calories which will keep your body from storing the fat and going into starvation mode.  Add a little more to your diet and I promise you will be able to lose the weight by April.|`|p5kzRDIpaa	Defo not enough for one day, and adding another fruit salad wont help, you need a bit more variety<br>  You weight sounds fine! The exercise you did was really good and will help burn the calories but I think eat another meal, make sure you get 3 meals a day, small portions and you'll be well on the way to lose 8-10 lbs :)|`|j7OYZPEsaa	Use some weight loss tools to find out: the menu planner helps you create healthy diet plans; the calorie counter counts the calories in your meals and tells you if that's more than you need to reach your ideal weight; the workout planner helps you choose exercises to burn excess calories; the BMI calculator calculates your current and ideal body mass index.
mSjglSI6aa	Yes.  Any med to attack bacterial infection can cause yeast infection.  These meds also deplete your system of the healthy bacteria which keep yeast at bay.  Yeast loves open space and no competition. <br>  <br>  1st - start taking a good probiotic, preferably refrigerated with live bacteria.  I like Natural Factors: <a href="http://www.iherb.com/ProductDetails.aspx?pid=2716&at=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.iherb.com/ProductDetails.aspx...</a><br>  <br>  2nd - for immediate knock down of yeast, take Grapefruit Seed Extract: <a href="http://www.iherb.com/ProductDetails.aspx?pid=4215&at=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.iherb.com/ProductDetails.aspx...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.iherb.com/ProductDetails.aspx?pid=4214&at=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.iherb.com/ProductDetails.aspx...</a> <br>  Nutribiotic is the preferred brand. You can take it in either liquid or pill form.  If in the upper digestive track, liquid is more effective.  Pills work too though, and don't taste as bad. <br>  <br>  3rd - cut back on sugar.  Sugar feeds yeast.  Sugar substitutes are not a good option unless Stevia (which doesn't metabolize as sugar)<br>  <br>  If you go to a doctor for yeast, they are likely to give you more antibiotics, which will help short term, but set up a terrible cycle of infections.  Best to treat the yeast naturally.  <br>  <br>  Best prices for the products I've seen is at iHerb (where the links are).  If you do get from there instead of local health food store, use coupon code KES097 at checkout for $5 off.  Shipping is free over $60, only $4 otherwise.  They have very fast service.  (not affiliated, just where I've found the cheapest prices)<br>  <br>  Hope you are feeling better soon.
mSjglSI6aa	Chlorine in the bleach will be absorbed through your skin and cause other problems.  Not really a safe use of bleach.   <br>  <br>  Best bet for foot bacteria (and most any other) is Grapefruit Seed Extract.  There are directions on the bottle for using it. This is what you are looking for: <a href="http://www.iherb.com/ProductDetails.aspx?pid=4215&at=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.iherb.com/ProductDetails.aspx...</a><br>  That link is the best price I've found anywhere.  Definitely cheaper than my local health food store, by 1/2. <br>  <br>  If you do get it, and from iHerb, use the coupon code KES097 at checkout for another $5 (if you are a first time customer).   - I'm not affiliated with iHerb, just a very happy customer.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	It sounds to me it might kill your feet, let alone the germs.|`|DMhAPurkaa	Bleach will kill any organism in 60 seconds.<br>  Learned that studying microbes.<br>  Mayo does soften and also has vinegar in it that is a natural antibacterial<br>  So, sounds feasible<br>  You can also rub salt or sugar and a little oil on your feet to smooth them.<br>  The mayo will have a smell to it though, I mean, I use mayo on my hair to soften it before I wash it, and it smells like a salad or a sandwich<br>  so your feet and socks will smell like a sandwich .<br>  You can use lemon half and sugar or salt rubbed on your heels to exfoiliate them..|`|2FtkHC2vaa	You shouldn't do that, bleach will eventually dry your skin and could eat through your skin as will. Also, it's really not a good idea to kill off ALL bacteria from your body, doing do will cause your body not to get immune to fight agents germs. All those different hand sanitizers out there on the market do MORE HARM THAN GOOD. So, just use some regular soap and worm water, not hot tho, because hot water will dry up your skin.|`|xjMjWUUYaa	You could try it although i would imagine that the bleach would burn the feet and the mayonnaise would make your foot smell like a sandwich :)
HxXduL1maa	There are two possible medical causes for man boobs, Gynecomastia or Pseudogynecomastia. Which type you have determines what course of action is best for effective treatment. It's critical that you figure out which type you have, because the treatments are very different.<br>  Gynecomastia occurs by a combination of:<br>   <br>  increase in Estrogen <br>   <br>   Decrease of Testosterone<br>   <br>  Also, some medications are known to bring on the dreaded man boob condition, including:<br>  <br>      Cimetidine<br>   <br>   Spironolactone<br>   <br>   Finasteride<br>  <br>  There are other possible medical conditions behind the problem as well; for example a thyroid condition.<br>   <br>  If you’re between the ages of 12 and 18, what you’ll need to do to get rid of man boobs is—nothing. If you’re a teenage boy and your man boobs are getting sensitive and even a little bit bigger, there’s no reason to fret; this is a normal part of male development during puberty. Trust me, I had sensitive nipples when I was younger, and good god was I scared I was turning into a woman—but I didn’t, and neither will you. Just wait it out, or if you’re really that concerned, go see a doctor and they’ll tell you the same thing.<br>    <br>  If you’re over the age of 25 and you’re starting to notice your man boobs getting bigger it might be time to adjust your diet. Once men like you and I start getting closer to 30 the metabolism that kept us from growing beautiful man bosoms when we were younger starts to slack on us a little bit. It’s time to stop with the meat and potatoes diet. Drink less beer, for sure, and stop eating sweets if you want to get rid of man boobs.  <br>  Diet isn’t the only thing; if you’re serious about getting rid of man boobs, you’re going to start cardio-aerobic exercises ASAP. After a certain age men tend to build up fat that starts to look like boobs. When your body loses or burns fat, it does so in a global sense; that is, it doesn’t just reduce fat in one area, but all areas. What’s the quickest way to convert fat to energy? Aerobic exercises like running, cross-country skiing, and biking are the best way to lose fat and your plump little man boobies.  <br>  Anaerobic exercises (weight lifting) are also a good way to get rid of man boobs. The first exercise you’ll want to focus on is the incline bench press. Most gyms have a machine that focuses specifically on your upper chest; this is the incline press machine. A greater amount of muscle mass in the upper chest will tighten some of that flab around the nipples. Remember that building muscle mass with a weight training regiment requires fewer reps with greater weight.  <br>  Working the lower chest, shoulders, and upper back are good things to focus on if you want to reduce the appearance of your man boobs. Building mass around the lower chest will make your boobs look more like Conan’s man pecs than Grandma’s sagging womanhood. Building muscle in the shoulders and the upper back will also stretch and tighten the skin of the upper torso on a whole, so work on building greater muscle mass up there as well as on your chest.|`|qb9V9syNaa	Buy a BRO!  A bra for dudes with moobs.|`|6TSwoU3yaa	Surgery is not the only way.<br>  Neither is excessive exercise.<br>  You may have a chemical imbalance, and the only way to find out is to let your doctor do a thorough check up.|`|yO7UTJrsaa	I suggest you exercise even more but dont overdo it. Your manboobs will go away in time.If that doesnt work, i suggest buying a sportsbra or a padded bra. Good luck|`|5LWUiaeXaa	corset ;)|`|AF8mfXQZaa	plastic surgery. it's the only way.
VerfhAQcaa	I am currently using the Mirena, I have had it since the end of Dec. The only complaints that I have are that it hurt pretty bad while the doc was inserting it (they have to open your cirvix), and then I had a light period, like so light I only had to use panty liners, for like a month almost.... but I havnt had my regular period, and I dont have to worry about remembering to take a pill every day.<br>  <br>  So I say go for it, get the mirena.
TbLvYpbcaa	Concealer! Dream matte mousse concealer is the best around I've found! Getting rid of spots is a guessing game. Just keep your skin clean and pores free as much as you can.

5PIgZ7tFaa	First of all, I'm very sorry for your loss. There are no hard and fast rules for going through the grieving process. It will take as long as it takes; no more and no less.<br>  I truly wish that I could say or do something that would help take your pain away. The only thing I can say is that you need to recognize that it is YOU who is still alive to experience all of those feelings. <br>  I lost my fiance to suicide more than 20 years ago, and I still feel pain. You just have to realize that the pain will never truly go away. <br>  The only advice I can give you is to thank God you are still alive to remember her, and that she is still alive as long as you keep a special place for her in your heart.<br>  Joining her would serve no purpose other than doubling a tragedy. If she truly meant something to you, then you will redouble your efforts to make your life that much more meaningful.<br>  <br>      I know that this doesn't really answer your question. <br>       <br>      She was your wife, and picked you for some good reason. Prove to the world that she wasn't mistaken. <br>  <br>       Again, I'm trying to answer a question that really doesn't have an answer. It will take as long as it takes. Be strong, and be thankful that you are still able to feel what you feel. <br>  <br>        I'm just sorry that I couldn't be of more help.|`|gUCjkj9oaa	around six months.|`|723b6c501277c00da34a847a55f2d416aa	They say the minimum is a year (to get through all the major holidays, birthdays, and events), but really, only you can say when you will be "over it," if ever....I can't imagine it would take only a year because a) you were with her so long, b) she committed suicide, and c) you are going through a rough time and need her.  I would go see a counselor and talk about it.|`|FOaypoRtaa	You never get over the pain or  the shock of losing  your loved on, you somehow manage to cope. Just cry when you need to and please  don't feel guilty when you do something your like, it only makes it harder to move on. Personally  I  have to remember to breath and I   just cry all day,  but I still  need to live .Baby steps  do only  as much as you can and dont listen to other people telling  you to get over it . Only you understand  the enermous pain that starts in the pit of your stomach   that can consume your entire body.  <br>    Hardest for me was the first of xmas then birthdays etc.  Running clears your head and the fitter you are helps your body cope with the  enourmous stress  you are dealing with . I have age 10 years in 4 weeks and lost half my body weight.Time does not heal all pain we learn to deal with it.(slowly)<br>  Talk about your wife she was an important part of you.  Remember the great times you had. Remember her smile  and the way she looked at you that made your heart  flutter. <br>  I feel for you and understand your pain pls hang in there you will have your good days enjoy them because there are few.|`|2NhdTxBTaa	For me...NEVER.  I lost my beloved mom who is my soul mate, best friend, my everything a little over a year ago.  And yes, I want to join her.  Everyday I miss her more than the day before.  We literally are soul mates, and I will never get over the loss.  I do hope that one day we will be reunited.  Until then, I am existing. The world I once knew as color is now black and white. What has kept me alive are my fur kids and hers. She always said that if something were to happen to her, for me to take care of her beloved dog.  I am keeping that promise.  And mine have saved my life. They give such unconditional love it is amazing. One of mine has a tumor in her bladder and according to the vet, will be leaving.  The thought terrifies me.  But they are getting all the love they give me.  I would advise you to get a pet.  You won't be lonely and the unconditional love will see you through.  Good Luck and Take Care  <br>  I am deeply sorry for your loss, and please don't think of suicide. You don't want to hurt others as you have been hurt.  You will be with her one day.|`|NDS2MsQnaa	you need to find someone else as hard as that may seem. it will make you feel better
IKakoOfyaa	There's usually no appreciable wait after testing and diagnosing is done unless the surgeon is on vacation or his/her schedule is booked solid.  The longest I've ever seen in that case is 2 weeks.|`|b876bdbe9593c6e05de8ebd41f870433aa	For both of my hips' replacements, the choice of date was pretty much up to me.  This is usually considered elective surgery and I wanted to have it done at my convenience if possible.  Because I needed to self-donate blood before surgery, there had to be at least enough time to do that within the time frame required (usually there's a 1-week wait between donations and the blood can't be too old; however the patient also doesn't want to go right from blood donation to OR either so a week or so is needed between the last donation and surgery day).  In addition, it is customary to have pre-op testing done in separate appointments with your Primary care provider so those have to be scheduled as well.  Anyhow it worked out to be about 2 months between decision to have surgery and the actual surgery day for each of my replacements.  That gave us plenty of time to plan ahead & prepare the house for my homecoming and study up about what the recovery would be like.|`|X68nU9hdaa	Before I got arthritis, I enjoyed an active lifestyle that included swimming, walking, bicycling.. But when I started getting arthritis, everyday life became difficult. The more I walked the worse it [the arthritis pain] got, the pain was like a knife twisting inside. Sometimes my hip would give out, it just wouldn't support me. Then there was the sharp pain. Before surgery, the pain was absolutely debilitating. I was getting totally disabled. I couldn't walk. I couldn't stand. That's when I decided that I needed to do something. Once at church I met an very old friend of mine who suffered from the same pain as mine and that’s when she recommended me Fly2india4health Consultants in India , my first thought about surgery in India was fear. I researched on my condition and my possible treatment options. I also spoke with the associate orthopedic surgeon with Fly2india4health Consultants who gave me educational material to help set my expectations after surgery. I was also been told that I would be up the same day as surgery and I was. The most important thing after the surgery is exercise. After surgery, I didn't have to take a lot of pain medication - maybe for 2 or 3 days. I attribute that to the skill of my surgeon. I was driving two weeks after surgery, Had I known it was going to be this easy, I would have had it done much earlier. If u need any orthopaedic care I will certainly advice you to go to Fly2india4health Consultants!<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.fly2india4health.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fly2india4health.com</a>

z8jYprWkaa	I shouldn't think you'd catch ANYTHING using a CANDOM|`|Rk46lIBwaa	You certainly can. At best condoms offer 50% protection against STDs. Since the risk of HIV increases with increasing number of partners, your dalliance might just cost you your life!|`|UcgWrGaAaa	I'm sure you are aware that there are other STDs (sexually trasmitted diseases) you can catch and regrettably even with a condom you can get crabs, herpes, and genital warts, there may be more.  I don't care if they look clean, a person can still be shedding cells and pass you herpes.  Can you see cells?  Yeah, herpes is not a nice disease.

IKakoOfyaa	You really need to press your doctor about having a tonsillectomy.  My youngest son suffered from asthma, but after he had his tonsillectomy at age 4, the asthma resolved.  His doctor felt it was the constant, low-level infection of recurring tonsillitis that induced the asthma.  I'm not saying this will happen in your case, but it's a consideration.<br>  <br>  Generally, you will start feeling better 3 days after beginning antibiotic therapy and feel completely well again after 5 to 7 days.  Gargling with warm salt water and using throat spray or lozenges containing a local anesthetic (such as Chloraseptic) can help ease the pain.  Eating cold foods such as popsicles can also help.<br>  <br>  ++++++++++++++++++++++<br>  <br>  Make sure you gargle with the warm salt water every 3 or 4 hours.  I don't know how many days you've been on antibiotics, but take the start day and count forward.  If it's been 5 days since you started taking them, you should feel better by Saturday.  If you've had no improvement in your symptoms after 3 days of antibiotic therapy, you need to call your doctor.|`|GgMMvHI8aa	I had mine removed at age 17. Very rare for an older person to have it done. But had suffered with it for about 2yrs. Then one doc took a look back thru my chart and counted 8 times withn 12 months. I was sick constantly. So they FINALLY removed them.  <br>   <br>  Usually they are removed at a young age. I never had problems at a young age. It was in my teen years. ALSO docs keep trying to treat with meds to not bother with surgery.  <br>   <br>  But seriously, more then 8-9 times within 12 months is too much and they need to be removed. I rarely get sick now.
xmibEEdcaa	Although I know the painkillers can help calm you down, there are far better meds for anxiety.  Are you taking anything for depression with anxiety?  If not, then I'd highly recommend you seek professional help with that.  Self-medicating with pain-killers is only going to cause you huge problems down the line, and it won't work for very long as a test aid, either.  A good anti-anxiety medication will work far better and it will continue to work longer -- and more to the point, it will help you to feel less anxiety all the time, not just every once in a while.<br>  <br>  If you are on something for the depression with anxiety, then it may be that your anti-depressant just isn't the right one for you. Some of them are more "upper-like," and thus not as good for people who have anxiety issues. I'd talk to your psychiatrist about switching to a med that's better for anxiety.  You might also ask him if there's something he can give you for those especially anxiety-provoking occasions, like important exams. I know people who have prescriptions for sedatives for that very purpose. They're less addictive than pain-killers, less highly scheduled, and far less likely to cause you problems down the line.|`|PmSrRSfuaa	Pain Killers. Making you think you smart ever since you screwed up your brain!|`|5PIgZ7tFaa	If you have to use drugs to pass a test, or to cope with the crap in life, you're on your way to a very tough life my friend. There's other ways to loosen up for a test.|`|GfG6wupTaa	I LOVE pain pills myself, but if you take them everytime you need to think you are going to become addicted!

Now take care of the rest.|`|vOjf6hBSaa	i was hooked on oxy's and pretty much any pain pill i could get my hands on, Getting high does not = High scores, you might have passed your GED but your gonna fail life my friend, stop now will you still can, that is my best advice|`|LVDV6PjKaa	Do what u gotta do...|`|BFf9x0G3aa	Honestly, from the personal experience of being a college student, i prefer to take things like adderall. something that would be prescribed for ADD or ADHD because it helps keep me awake, alert, and focused
su9CEx0eaa	It makes you constipated if thats what you mean.|`|HUrYSp4oaa	yes it would, it contains codeine and one of the side effects of codeine is constipation.  u need to drink more water, take more fibre and if that doesnt work a laxative.|`|DtG4zpM2aa	If you're taking solpadeine regularly (ie 4 times a day for a few days or longer), even though it doesn't have a massive amount of codeine in it, it's extremely likely to cause constipation.   It's not the paracetamol that affects your digestive system, it's just the codeine that slows your system down.   If you're only taking it occassionally (ie 2 tablets from time to time if you have a headache) it shouldn't be a problem, though.   So if you are have to take it regularly, best to up your fibre intake, eat plenty of fruit/veg, drink plenty of water and consider taking laxatives if required.
lmT3zXa9aa	Yes, this could all be due to hormones from your period.  Specifically this is caused by the level of prostaglandins which help trigger uterine contractions.  Unfortunately, prostaglandins also trigger contractions in the bowel thus the diarrhea.  Try taking some ibuprofen as this will help with the diarrhea and the back pain.|`|nBGjPwViaa	Yes, I always have a few days w/upset tummy during my period.|`|ARmhMq5laa	it's normal,take a nice warm bath *wont bleed in the water* and you need to sip water on and off all day..eat something and then take a pain killer for your back and cramps also you can put something warm on your tummy and helps the cramps too,and get some good rest:)|`|AA11318212	yeap. i get that every month, makes me cranky too.<br>  Here's what I do to reduce the pain:<br>  A few days before my period or just before I get, I do long walks. I've read it helps stretch the muscles (even the ones inside of you) and lessens the pain when I get my period.<br>  If it hurts too much or as it is beginning to hurt, I take a midol or an advil (ibuprofen) and I stay of very cold drinks.<br>  I get loose bowels too, thats normal as your hormones and your body work is readjusting. It happens dont worry, thats normal.<br>  For the pain, a warm compress (hot water bag or hot and cold packs), does wonders when I place it on my tummy and on  my lower back.<br>  I also apply some efficanscent or eucalyptus/mint/ oil (the chinese kind) on my tummy and lower back (bengay should do the trip, but use a little as it may sting or burn you if you are not used to it).<br>  You can also do some stretching exercises just before you get your period. If you do these things, it will help and lessen the pain or get rid of the pain. JUST DON'T OVER MEDICATE or take more than 1000mg of ibuprofen. Don't mix it with alcohol too.<br>  If you still aren't satisfied with what i have told you, see a doctor,<br>  :)|`|njWh5Kobaa	From past experience it can have something to do with your period. I get all my cramps in my lower back, so it could be that. I always feel a little sick and just blah while i'm on my period. <br>  If it continues to long, Try going to the doctor. You don't want to get dehydrated or anything.|`|khtyNX4naa	Oh yah.  The first day or two I always feel like crap.  Diareah is common with alot of girls I know.

My consultant knows that I smoke but has not advised that I should stop (up to now).<br>  <br>  I know that smoking exacerbates cancers but I'll take my chances...|`|R8Hm0dFAaa	I smoked throughout my radiation therapy for hodgkins 23 years ago, but I wouldn't recommend it. I also smoked, but only occasionally, during my recent chemo for non-hodgkins lymphoma. Again, I wouldn't recommend it. Do as I say, not as I do. ;-).<br>  <br>  If the stress is too much, ask your doctor for something for the stress. My doc gave me lorazepam (Ativan) during my non-hodgkins treatment and it helped a lot. I've also used nicotine gum to quit smoking and that has worked very well for me.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your treatment.

t81MEJ82aa	There is no average weight of a 5'6 15 year old girl who works out a lot. Using weights will make your muscles bigger so of course it's going to make things bigger. Really it depends on what kind of body you want, and whether you "bulk up" depends on how you workout. Women cannot really bulk up however unless they are professional body builders or are on something. I would say just pay attention to how your body is developing and remember to also do cardio (if you aren't already) and aim for higher reps at a lighter weight if you are trying to look toned. But make this determination after seeing the results of your workouts to find out what "lighter" is exactly.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Also your diet is key.|`|1JsWMX0daa	1st of all, no, if you weigh more than you look than that means you are nice & very tight. <br>  <br>   2nd, yes, linemen do squats. keep it up & you'll soon be squating 300+ and look like a linebacker. do some simpler excersices like free weights and calisthenics (push ups, dips, sit ups, etc.) and use less weight before you end up looking like lawrence taylor.|`|yX6McWyGaa	no you're not over weight. you should enjoy your youth and not waist it away think about your size.

IKakoOfyaa	What kind of drops did you get? <br>  <br>  Viral conjunctivitis usually gets worse 5 to 7 days after the first symptoms. It can get better in 10 days to 1 month. If only one eye is affected at first, the other eye may become infected up to 2 weeks later. Usually, if both eyes are affected, the first eye has worse conjunctivitis than the second. <br>  <br>  Bacterial conjunctivitis should improve within 2 days after you begin using antibiotics. If your eyes are not better after 3 days of antibiotics, call your healthcare provider.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	2 days after you start the drops, put a cold tea bag on it at night|`|eN9wxFdqaa	Dude , <br>  I had Viral Pinkeye in September . Let me just tell you that its the WORST thing in the world. It started in one eye and its almost impossible to keep it out of the other. <br>  <br>  Dead give aways for VIRAL pink eye is swollen eyelids , extreme red eyes , fluid discharge from the eye , swollen glands by your ears , sensitivity to light . <br>  <br>  I was out of work for a week+ and NO drops work. They will try to give you Zylet or something but its viral , like a cold it needs to run its course. Keep COLD compresses on it and keep away from people. Steriod drops or any of that crap wont work , just cost you money. And if a Dr tells you otherwise , get a new one. What will help aside from the cold compress is just plain eye drops to keep flushing the eye out. The infection is in the tears and you need to keep it flowing. <br>  <br>  Mine was so aggitating and itchy that I actually scratched my cornea from rubbing and had to keep my eye closed for 48 hrs and that was the WORST pain. I didnt sleep and even with my eyes closed , a TV would hurt. I had to sit in my room alone in a beach chair for 2 days with my eyes closed. Sounds crazy but its true. When you lay down your eyes roll back and that caused great pain. You wake up with your eyes stuck closed. With viral , its a constant tearing thing , with bacterial its more green crust in the morning. The redness will last 2 -3 weeks depending on how bad you have it . Dont take this lightly , its serious and EXTREMELY contagious. I walked around with wipes. <br>  <br>  Also with the Viral pink eye , you can can have issues months down the line. Even now my eyes tear up and are very sensitive to bright light . I had perfect vision too. Its an aweful thing and I dont wish it on my worst enemy.

VPlKbDplaa	The herb that is specifically said to help with that is Agnus castus, otherwise known as Chasteberry or Vitex. It works at the level of the pituitary gland to help regulate the hormones.  It is often taken by ladies who have PCOS and want to improve their fertility. You must not take it though if on the pill. Agnus castus should help to regulate your periods but you may need to have taken it for several months to see some effect. <br>  <br>  <br>  I would also recommend fish oil (omega 3) and Evening Primrose oil. They also act as hormone regulators. To reduce the testosterone effect (in addtion to Agnus castus which should help by regulating your hormones) you can drink lots of mint tea.....particularly effective for hirsutism (that may be a side effect of PCOS) according to Turkish studies. Saw palmetto is another herb that could help reduce the testosterone effect before it is re-balanced. <br>  <br>  Get your blood sugar levels checked and your thyroid function too.

AA11432707	You'd be better off switching to a drug that does not have an antagonist as part of it.  You can certainly stay on pain medication right up to surgery, as long as it doesn't contain aspirin or NSAIDs other than acetaminophen. (clotting problems with those)<br>  <br>  The problem with suboxone is that it contains a drug that will block what we use in anesthesia from working.  It will make it very difficult to get you comfortable during and after surgery, unless you have something like a spinal or epidural.<br>  <br>  Suboxone is usually reserved for addicts, so I'm also surprised you got it for pain.  Your prescribing doctor probably doesn't know what we do in anesthesia, and may not know what problems hat particular drug will cause.|`|sqau5QPDaa	I'm surprised you were prescribed suboxone for pain. It's an opiate blocker but I guess I can see it's use on someone with no tolerance to opiates. Your doctor probably wants you to stop taking them because like the anesthesia suboxone is a depressant. He probably doesn't want your heart rate too low. Five days isn't really necessary, just 12 or so hours before the anesthetic and your heart should be back on track. Good luck.
XXdlvm4daa	youd do well to get the surgery and here is why. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune condition, which means your body is attacking itself. there are lots of conditions like this but in the case of MG your body is attacking something called the neuromuscular junction. Its a fancy name but its responsible for transmitting the current generated in a nerve to, the muscle itself so it can contract. So if your body is destroying these, you will feel weak because you cannot contract your muscle. <br>  <br>  The reason you are on steroids is because they have an anti-inflammatory action, and also to a certain extent reduce the function of your immune system and will therefore hopefully make your symptoms better. Unfortunately steroids have very many functions, and therefore side effects which is why your face is puffing up and their not a particularly nice drug to be on for a long time.<br>  <br>  Why surgery? Your body is attacking itself, but specifically, it is the T-lymphocytes (type of white blood cell involved in immunity) that are doing the 'attacking'. T-cells are produced by the bone marrow but cannot initially tell apart foreign material and invading bugs from the body itself, so they must be tailored so they do not destroy the body! This is called 'T-cell education' and occurs in the thymus gland.<br>  <br>  The thymus is primarily active in childhood and not so much in adults. It is believed that taking away the source of the T-cells confusion will help, and the evidence does suggest that the majority of patient's symptoms are much improved after having had the gland removed. You might also want to ask about a drug called neostigmine, which reduces the breakdown of actelycholine, the chemical used to transfer the message accross the gap between the nerve cell and the muscle|`|xNBFsEnsaa	My grandfather took the surgery and felt much better afterwords.

It's never safe to drink them and I know by experience.  On my mother's side of the family, they have weak stomachs which I inherited.  Three years ago I started to feel week, nauseated and having a lot of pain in my back.  I had no idea of what was going on.  One night I had diarrhoea and the next morning I fainted.  Long story short, I had lost most of my blood because of two ulcers in my stomach. They had been cause by a prescription of strong ibuprofen and I had to have two units of blood.  I never drank pop a lot but I liked to take 4 to 6 ounces once in a while.  After a year or so of being careful and my ulcers being okay, I took a little bit of coke.  Then I started to lose blood again and it went on and off.  Finally, I realized that there was a pattern, when I drank coke, I lost blood and when I didn't everything was fine.  I stop drinking coke last July and didn't have a problem after.  Coffee is supposed to be bad and yet if I only drink a mug or two a day I don't have any problem.  Remember that I never drank more than 6 ounces a day.  You can see the result by putting a nail in Coke or Pepsi for a little while, it's not pretty.|`|6d7m0kWWaa	large amounts of the sweeteners in coke can cause memory loss (aspartame) and cancer (acesulfame potassium), but that's large amounts.

These nails show raised ridges and are thing an dconcave." - <a href="http://www.hooked-on-nails.com/naildisorders.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hooked-on-nails.com/naildisor...</a>|`|GfG6wupTaa	I have that. My doctor said it is from smoking.
el8yX5q3aa	No ..they are pumped up vitamins..if they don't harm a baby they aren't going to hurt a guy.<br>  <br>  they contain more vitamins etc that your body quicky depletes while being pregnant.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	It's just vitamins and minerals.<br>  He'd be fine.<br>  There's nothing special in them.<br>  There's no estrogen, or any other hormone.<br>  <br>  He might get sick though, if he's never taken a vitamin supplement before.<br>  Those things are so nasty-tasting.|`|5rqVTOzmaa	Nothing would happen. I think the only side effect a guy might experience would be healthier hair and nails, just like us women! The prenatal pills are just vitamins.|`|rVPrhd26aa	i accidentally took some because i though they were drugs and my girl was holding out on me... I ended up crying all night watching romance movies and ate a whole jar of peanut butter.
GfG6wupTaa	I was on percocet for about a week, and didn't get hooked. It was like a chippy when I stopped though.|`|gUCjkj9oaa	do tell them,they can give you anaesthetics specially for recovering addicts.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Yes tell the surgeon and the nurses. It is very important that they know this so they can treat your pain effectively.|`|upwwspFIaa	TELL THE DOCTORS!!!! You don't want to end up with a habit because you are trying to get your body taken care of. There are great NON NARCOTIC pain meds they can give you. Ultram is one of the best. That's what I have taken after surgery. I suggest you ask about non narcotic pain treatments so you dont end up dead or going through the hell of having an active habit. I had a broken ankle in 2004 and I had been clean for 4 years off of a bad heroin habit. I was in so much pain I didn't care and got the Percoset script filled like an a@#hole! I caught a habit from the percs and ended up on a two year run that almost killed me. Now I have 3 years clean and when I go to the dentist or doctor? I just tell them I have an allergy and I cant take narcotics which is a common thing actually. There are plenty of people who cant take narcotics that aren't junkies. Just lie, your an addict, tell em your allergic and stay clean!! I hope you do the right thing.|`|20LnuCejaa	You have to tell the doctor everything.  Information will be kept confidential.  Reason you have to tell them about any addictions and any medicines you are taking is, so the anesthesiologist can formulate anesthesia drugs especially for you.  Otherwise you can put yourself at risk.|`|cfcuBxdsaa	i feel you on this one i believe they have some type of pain relievers they are not opiate based so go ahead and let them know the last thing you want is to come out of surgery re addicted.|`|PU5Qq1bIaa	Definitely tell them.  When I had my ACL surgery; I had a femoral nerve block and it worked so well that I did not have to take any oral medication.  The block is placed and left for 2-3 days and will basically keep your entire leg numb.  It is sooo nice!  Good Luck
estIQEVNaa	No, sometimes they make you have a little fever.
Y4s4Om38aa	If its the anxiety, back off and give her a chance to calm down.  I know if my anxiety acts up often i only need a chance to calm down, and if feel like i still have pressure on me, then i cant completely calm down.  If shes not mad, then really all you can do is assure her that you are there for her and if there is anyway you can help to let you know.  Anxiety getting wound up leads to a lot of irrational fears......been there.  Also suggest she talk to her psychiatrist about adjusting or changing her medication, as its not working well.  If she is only seeing a GP for anxiety meds, she probably should be seeing a psychiarist.|`|TBYbzFIaaa	Honestly, sounds like a guilt trip to me.  She knows that she did something wrong and has turned it on you.  You cut a freaking air freshener...omg you are going to hit her?! That doesn't make sense to me haha.|`|N7xDpSQxaa	Move on bro ...............<br>  <br>  You deserve to be happy too.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|RCfc9hMKaa	Are you sure she's been taking her medication? Maybe she went off of it and that's what caused her to fly off like that. You've got to give her space to calm down and reassure her, over and over if you have to, that you would never hurt her and that you were just frustrated and were taking it out on the cigarettes. At this point, she has to come down from it and realize on her own that she's acting irrationally. Reassure her and ask her to tell you what she's feeling and why. Maybe if she's going to a therapist you could ask to accompany her to a session to talk about what happened? It might help you both get insight and it would provide a safe intermediary. Otherwise, I'd just say give it some time, lots of reassurance, and don't blame yourself.|`|9jc6mNxIaa	You don't mention your ages. I am going to assume you are both young adults. You absolutely need to read a book called Ten Stupid Things Men Do to Mess Up Their Lives by Dr Laura Schlessinger.<br>  <br>  Too many guys get hung up on trying to fix damsels in distress. from what you described here this young lady is a poster child for "high maintenance drama queen". There are too many wonderful people available to get stuck in a relationship with a problem child. <br>  <br>  Liars and deceivers get very good at it and use it to manipulate you to get what they want. She may be cute but you will look back five years from now and regret your wasted effort.|`|upwwspFIaa	Sounds like you scared her. Have you ever thought mabye you have an anger problem? Just a question. I wouldnt blame it all on her because it takes two to tango. You freaked about the smokes and she got freaked by you!! Its simple. You have to realize( and Im not advocating smoking) smoking is extremely addictive and with quitting can come anxiety. One of the number one reasons people smoke in the first place is to control stress and anxiety. You need to support her instead of basically calling her crazy.Girls get emotional, its their nature. And us guys have to hold them and say its ok baby I love you. You have to assure her that you arent out to get her and you do support her especially in this tough time. Be there for her and if she slips up and smokes dont throw a fit. Girls want to make sure they can trust us. When you found the smokes you should have said, look I know this is very hard to do but if you still want to quit im here to help and just asked her to be honest with you because her lying breaks trust too. She cant be sneaking around smoking behind your back either. Mabye she feels pressure to quit because you hate it so much. Stop labelling her all these things,PTSD blah blah blah. So she has anxiety and some other issues. Are you perfect?  Its very unnerving how you try and justify what you did by explaining it calmly, like I used a regular cutting board, and you tell us the length of the knife. Scary bro. You might be a bit controlling.I would just let her come to you now. Its not cool though to make someone out to be crazy just to satisfy your ego. I hope you guys find your way. And good luck. Take it easy amn.|`|AA11707728	I'd dump her.<br>  <br>  Her thinking that she is anyway allowed to "flip out" for any reason, is problematical.<br>  <br>  Her reframing it in terms of abuse is intolerable.  Later on, she will claim you are abusive and hurtful towards her for such things as not wanting her to smoke crack or something or hang around with gang members.  She'll react to you as if you were abusive.<br>  <br>  Best to cut your losses early. <br>  <br>  If a woman won't follow your lead on most things, especially when you are obviously right about something is just going to inject more and more chaos into the relationship.  Ironically, a lead to follow is what almost all women want in a man and is the major determinant of their love and attraction for you.  Guess what happens with the woman who won't accept such behavior from you?  That's right, she "falls out of love" with you without any real rhyme or reason, then leaves.  These women are screwed up.<br>  <br>  But the real problem are the dorks that consider non-tolerance of bad behavior to be abuse.  Ironically, these women almost always end up with men who beat them, after they leave you for being "abusive".  Yeah, you want to get rid of these fruitloops real quick.<br>  <br>  Things like "anxiety", eating disorders, mental problems of various vague symptomology, and especially drug use of any kind are all big warning signs.  If your woman ever has any of that, just get rid of her.  Things might be OK in the short term.  But they won't remain that way for long.  In the end, she'll just leave anyway.  Has nothing to do with you and everything to do with the fact that they are f-ed up.<br>  <br>  Well, there are plenty of women who are not f-ed up.  Why not create a lasting, satisfying relationship with one of these instead?  Let the f-ed up ones find an equally f-ed up man to be with.<br>  <br>  You're taking a break?  Why not just not call her back ever again.  She's almost certainly out screwing around with other men (ha....bet you didn't know that's what "taking a break" means in womanspeak).  Just let her wander off with someone else.  Likely, if you don't call, you'll never ever hear from her again.|`|ad9AssJZaa	Yeah, anxiety and PTSD can do crap like that to a person, expecially if she was abused in the past. the smoking thing, while a major health issue, unfortunately you should either leave it alone or at least not do things to aggrravate her about it. People with MI(Myself included) Have a VERY VERY difficult time quitting smoking, moreso than the average person because when a person with a mental disorder quits smoking, it's not only the first three days that are the worst, it's the fist year or so, only because quitting smoking can and WILL exacerbate ANY mental illness to an annoying extreme. My sister has anxiety issues and when she quit smoking, it got SOOO bad I worried she would commit suicide or we would have to commit her somewhere. She cried every moment of every day. Though she DID do it the wrong way, she quit cold turkey one day. The very BEST way for most people to quit is by cutting back gradually to nothing, don't ever let her quit cold turkey, this would be too much of a shock to her mind honestly. She's doing the best she can, if you want to put up with it and help her, do, if you can't take it, don't.

CXwjdUgDaa	The guidelines of being overweight and underweight are a little harsh.<br>  I would never go by those. To me you sound like you are perfect, but that is just my opinion. If you feel like you are overweight then just take a few walks here and there throughout the week.|`|gUCjkj9oaa	You are overweight men this height should weigh about 160 at most,so women of this height should weigh much less.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Sounds more like a rant.<br>  <br>  "Your opinion on how healthy I sound"<br>  <br>  You haven't given us your exercise regimen or an idea of what your diet's like, so in my opinion, you could be the most unhealthiest slob in the world, or one of the healthiest.  Without sufficient info i couldn't tell ya.|`|RoKhWSoXaa	Muscle weighs more than fat. Without more data, I can't be specific, but anyone who wears a size 9 is certainly not overweight or obese, unless they are 4'6" or something. BMI is a flawed standard, as is weight. <br>  <br>  Many world class athletes are "obese" by BMI standards, because they are so strong. But that is all muscle not fat. And no one would say they are actually fat, unhealthy, or obese.<br>  <br>  Thin people, who have high fat, can be obese, in terms of percentage body fat. And overweight people, can be perfectly healthy, by percentage body fat. Those "overweight" people might weigh more, yet wear a smaller size, because of muscle vs. fat.<br>  <br>  1 pound of muscle is quite small, and gives you strength. Having muscle, even for women, is not a bad thing. 1 pound of fat takes up alot of space, and is bad. Having alot of fat, even if you "weigh" less is bad.<br>  <br>  Unlike the thin ones, odds are you simply have a very low body fat percentage and alot of muscle, and if that's true, you are not overweight by any standard.  If you are concerned, you can estimate you percentage body fat on the following sites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stevenscreek.com/goodies/pi.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.stevenscreek.com/goodies/pi.s...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dietandfitnesstoday.com/body-fat-percentage-calculator.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.dietandfitnesstoday.com/body-...</a><br>  <br>  As long as you eat a healthy diet and exercise, don't worry about weight too much. Health is much more important than some number on the scale anyway.

Some dirt is full of nutrients. There are actually quite a few pregnant women who crave dirt because of the nutrients in it (I know weird but true). However you are never going to know exactly what it is you are putting in your mouth so I think it is best to steer clear of it and try to think of something else other than eating (dirt in particular) to help you through your hard times. If there is any kind of potting mix or manure etc in the dirt you are eating that would be really bad for your health as it is full of chemicals and all sorts of other yucky things and it could make you quite sick. Best to seek some help from a professional to help you stop doing this.|`|52mi8Dwlaa	not so normal but who really is? <br>  make dirt pudding more normal lol. <br>  Its pudding (vanilla takes best but chocolate looks more natural)<br>  and mix in crushed up oreos. <br>  maybe ask a doctor even though I dont really see it as being unhealthy I just think there may be chemicals from the grass at a park?|`|TLiyAuCTaa	you have something called Pica.

dpgXzMenaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMDD" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMDD</a><br>  <br>  PMDD is premenstrual syndrome (PMS) that is so severe it can be debilitating due to either physical, mental or emotional symptoms. Treatment is recommended because PMDD interferes with the sufferer's ability to function in her social or occupational life. The cardinal symptom--surfacing between ovulation and menstruation, and disappearing within a few days after the onset of the bleeding--is irritability (PMID 11571794). Anxiety, anger, and depression may also occur. The main symptoms, which can be disabling, include[3]<br>  <br>  feelings of deep sadness or despair, possible suicide ideation <br>  feelings of tension or anxiety <br>  panic attacks <br>  diarrhea <br>  mood swings, crying <br>  lasting irritability or anger, increased interpersonal conflicts <br>  apathy or disinterest in daily activities and relationships <br>  difficulty concentrating <br>  fatigue <br>  food cravings or binge eating <br>  insomnia or hypersomnia <br>  feeling "out of control" <br>  increase or decrease in sex drive <br>  increased need for emotional closeness <br>  physical symptoms: bloating, heart palpitations, breast tenderness, headaches, joint or muscle pain <br>  Five or more of these symptoms may indicate PMDD. Symptoms occur during the week before the menstrual cycle and disappear within a few days after the onset of the bleeding.|`|dtHjJah5aa	Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder or PMDD - an extreme version of PMT. It could affect up to 700,000 Australian women, yet most don't know they've got it and suffer in silence.<br>  <br>  So what exactly is PMDD? Hormones released from the pituitary gland, trigger ovulation. The change in hormones also triggers symptoms through the brain's neurotransmitters, affecting levels of serotonin - the chemical that helps moderate mood, sleep, aggression, even appetite. Doctors believe these changes trigger PMDD.<br>  <br>  "If you look at the facts, this does not occur in women before puberty or after menopause, it does not occur in woman who've had ovarian removal so it is clearly linked to the hormonal cycle," Dr Rampono said.<br>  <br>  PMDD - Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder<br>  Treatment options include: <br>  <br>  Adequate regular hours of sleep in the second half of the Menstrual Cycle <br>  Reduce caffeine, salt, alcohol and nicotine <br>  Regular exercise in the Aerobic range <br>  Relaxation strategies <br>  Vitamin B6 - up to 50 mg/day ONLY <br>  Medications that increase the efficacy of Serotonin in practical terms - the new generation Antidepressants - from day 14 to the commencement of Menstruation. These are generally known by the trade names of Lovan, Lexapro, Zoloft, Cipramil etc. <br>  Women who think they might have PMDD, should keep a diary for two months, rating their daily mood (on a 0-3 scale), and noting when their period occurs. In the case of PMDD, physical and emotional changes occur in the 7-14 days preceding their period. If you have these symptoms, see your doctor.
ZMmlMRG3aa	Hi Rob,<br>  <br>  I have a nice collection of candles, all sorts really.<br>  My favourite are mud chocolate scented candles, they are so lovely and they do get us both in the mood.<br>  <br>  My tip for you though, would be to aim for relaxation, because all great sex begins with a lovely bit of relaxation. So heres my tips for you, based on my own experience.<br>  Light a candle of your wifes favourite scent<br>  Only use lubricants, massage oils etc, with the same or no scent at all compared to the candle, as too many candles can really smell sickly.<br>  Offer a foot massage, and work your way up from there, making sure she is comfy and relaxed. <br>  Be persistent with this, even if she doesnt really go for it the first time round, it will work!<br>  Floral and fruity scents dont work for me, they just smell too sickly sweet, but a nice softly scented mocha or chocky candle is just lovely.<br>  Good luck!!|`|TFYlv3bxaa	I don't think that candles are going to help to be really honest.  Low libido in women is caused by many things, and scents don't fix it.  It could be the medicines she is taking reacting with one another, it could be she is just getting older, and her body isn't producing the right chemicals anymore.  It could be that her stress level is in overload, and she can't relax, much less want to have sex.  It really doesn't mean that she loves you any less.  Try not to take it personally, I know it's gotta be hard when a man thinks his woman doesn't want him.  Try to look into different things other than candles.  The last thing that I would want to see is a candle lit every time my husband was in the mood for sex, and trying to get me there.  Hell we might as well by stock in a candle company.  Good luck.|`|421b2fb60081b51b56d2f694ad49b8ceaa	Yes, your wife is in luck. I am a licensed Massage Therapist who specializes in Pure Essential Oils. My suggestions are  simple and have a holistic approach. For women with low libido try one of the following essential oils. Make sure though that it is an 100% grade or you will get a mostly watered downed oil. Try rose, ylang ylang, jasmine or nutmeg. You can put  2-3 drops on an unscented candle or a drop on the bed sheets.  For Professional grade oils I suggest looking at www.youngliving.com|`|3jFm0rWdaa	Eu de Brad Pitt?

BELIEVE me I have had my rounds with doctors and Psychiatrist. I would google them in the area and then call to see if they accept the insurance. You can also talk to his doctor and see if he recommends one or if he know anyone that can. The internet is GREAT at finding good doctors or info on them. Good luck!

I'd also suggest taking ibuprofen OR going to your dr and getting a prescription for an anti inflammatory. <br>  <br>  At bed time, apply heat to the area to help relax the muscles. Some gentle stretching throughout the day would be very beneficial. If you're on the computer, remember to get up and stretch the affected areas for a few minutes.

dBubtgCtaa	It looks pretty bad and painfull, go to see a dermatologist or even a pharmasist if you can.  If you want simply solution try using AQUEOUS creme, it really works, put in on in the shower/ bath, leave it to soak in for at least a minuet and then wash of, also E45 lotion and aboid at all cost perfumes/aftershaves, frangrenced lotions, hairspray and soap/shower gell, swap your usual shower gell for baby products, Johnsons baby soft wash or a simular product is ok, if you do go to see a doctor and they don't know what to suggest ask for DERMOL 500, its basically aqueous creme but it has an antiseptic in it, it really works, it amazing! and dos'nt smell too bad, ask for the one for use in the shower not the after lotion. Also this could be an allergic reaction to dust/dog/cat hair so avoid animals if you can untill you can check it out. You should really have an allergy test, you can get one that costs around ￡30 in chinese doctors type shops, they are very accurate and definaty worth the money although it does take around 10 days for the results to come back. Please feel free to ask any more advise if you like, I had a simular problem to this for a very long time untill i found the answer! Dermol 500 is really an amazing product (although i think only availible through perscription) don't be afraid of asking your doctor for what you want, GP's do not always have experience with everything and as i have found out it is alot quicker to be direct! It could be 'Keratosis Pilaris', but the picture isnt clear enough to definatly suggest that. Good Luck.

These responsibilities are printed usually on the paper form which stays with the transfusion container when it leaves the blood bank to go to the patient.  The nurse MUST identify and match the names of the patient to receive the blood with the name on the forms from the blood bank and the patient's wrist band as well as any identification numbers such as on a wrist band name tag.  Sometimes, the nurse will then start the transfusion, remaining close to the patient during the first 10 minutes to be sure there is no immediate transfusion reaction symptoms or signs.  During the transfusion, the nurse must watch to observe that the blood is running normally into the patient at the prescribed speed.  The nurse may have to make sure any required second unit of blood is ready and hooked up for the patient with no transfusion interruption.  The nurse must then discontinue the blood bag at the end and continue to observe the patient o be sure that is no delayed transfusion reaction.  The nurse must also be sure to return the empty transfusion blood bag to the blood bank for saving several days in case any investigation of a late reaction does occur.

I would recommend trying to see if you can dissolve the glue and gently work the nail off on your own by filing it, gently tugging and I've even heard that you can work dental floss underneath it to help separate it. The best method is to get a couple bowls you can fit your whole hand in and fill one with acetone and one with warm water. Soak your damaged nail for a while than alternate to the water and continue until you get it loose enough to come off. Otherwise you might need to take a trip to your local clinic and have them numb it and pull it off.<br>  <br>  If your nail is not totally ripped through than you can keep it bandaged and it will partially heal/grow out over the next few weeks.<br>  <br>  If it gets totally ripped through than you just need to keep it moist and wrapped and as long as the cuticle wasn't damaged a new one will regrow in a few months time.
IKakoOfyaa	Some pretty significant strides have been made in the treatment of HIV, but it is felt by most researchers that a cure is not immediately forthcoming. Although combinations of drugs that target the HIV reverse transcriptase and protease enzymes have clearly revolutionized the treatment of HIV/AIDS, problems with these agents, such as viral escape mutants, persistence of viral reservoirs, poor patient compliance due to complicated regimens, and toxic side effects, have emphasized the need for development of new drugs with novel mechanisms of action, as well as an HIV vaccine. <br>  <br>  Recently two new classes of drugs have been identified that interfere with the membrane fusion reaction required for HIV entry of target cells. Two such agents, T-20 (enfuvirtide) and T-1249, which have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), block the action of the fusogenic envelope glycoprotein gp41. Others target the HIV coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4, and are now in clinical trials. Also under development are novel agents that target the HIV integrase and HIV regulatory gene products as well as immunomodulators such as IL-12 and IL-2. <br>  <br>  In 1999, an international team of researchers reported that they had discovered the origins of HIV-1, the predominant strain of HIV in the developed world. A subspecies of chimpanzees native to west equatorial Africa had been identified as the original source of the virus. The researchers believe that HIV-1 was introduced into the human population when hunters became exposed to infected blood.<br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  Studies have shown that intermittent IL  therapy can result in substantial and sustained increases in CD4 counts in HIV-infected patients, especially those with baseline CD4 counts above 200 cells/mm.|`|QrmCMbbdaa	blah awesome

It is a precursor to serotonin. Fluoxetine allows for more serotonin to be active (that is a simple explanation). And do not take them together. Although rare, there can be some major complications. Talk to your doctor.<br>  <br>  For your weight. There is the healthy eating and exercise. Very important and can help depression on its own too. Often psychiatrists prescribe Topiramate (Topamax) along side of medications that cause weight gain. Topamax is not exactly strong forweight losss but it might stop you from gaining extra weight and even get rid of a little weight. Have you taken Bupropion (Wellbutrin)? It acts differently (it is a dopamine reuptakeinhibitorr and fluoxetine is aserotoninn reuptake inhibitor). Bupropion does not cause weight gain. And if the weight is a major issue I would speak with your doctor and do something. And (just so you know) there are some FDA approved diet medications.

pvYy6iTSaa	Dear lonely mom - Welcome to the changes of skin caused by sun exposure.  The brown spots you describe are commonly called "liver" spots, but only because of their color.  Liver spots are blemishes on the skin associated with aging and exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun. They are also known as age spots, sun spots, lentigos, or senile/solar lentigines. They range in color from light brown to red or black and are located in areas most often exposed to the sun, particularly the hands, face, shoulders, arms and forehead, and the head if bald. Liver spots are not related to the liver physiologically, but do have a similar color. It was once believed, incorrectly, that liver spots were due to liver problems.<br>  <br>  From the age of 40 onwards the skin is less able to regenerate from sun exposure, and liver spots are very common in this age group, particularly in those who spend time in the sunshine.<br>  <br>  In the vast majority of cases liver spots pose no threat, and no treatment is necessary. Occasionally, they have been known to obscure the detection of skin cancer.<br>  <br>  Some people wish to have these spots removed as they consider them unsightly; this can be done by cryotherapy or laser treatment.|`|5u92Bw3Baa	Its really hard to say.

oOly8Wj2aa	Hypnosis can work for many people: it can be an effective tool for reaffirming yourself, for developing coping strategies and ways to move forward with problems, and for understanding yourself better.    However, it's not a magical cure-all, and from the words you use - like "desperate" - it looks like that's what you're looking for. Be wary of taking on hypnotherapy or any other new therapy in the hope that it'll be a magic wand that fixes everything, because it almost certainly won't and you'll end up disappointed.    Instead; I'd recommend taking things one day at a time and trying to find small positive changes you can make for yourself, rather than learning to rely on other people. Find support in your friends, family, or anybody else, but don't set yourself up to feel like you need to be "rescued." There are no easy answers, but with sufficient determination and with a positive attitude (even when things go wrong, and they will), you can help yourself through this.    (If you're already going to therapy, though, keep doing that! But I wouldn't recommend taking any more on.)

khtyNX4naa	Only way to skip a month is to take the pill, then when its time to take the 4th week (the sugar pills - which are just reminders to stay on schedule with the pill taking) so instead of taking the 4th weeks pills, open a new pack of pills and start again.  This is safe to do for three months at a time.  There is actually a pill called Seasonale that does this.<br>  <br>  Other than taking the pill, I know of no way to control the little fun-hater we all know as our periods.|`|qg11igznaa	I agree with what everyone else has said about the pill. The only other way to miss your period is to stop eating. If you are malnourished enough, your body cannot afford to loose iron and skips a period. But obviously, don't try that. <br>  <br>  In terms of swimming however, the pressure of the water around your body keeps you from bleeding while swimming. Of course you'll still want to wear a tampon, but you shouldn't have to worry about bleeding in the pool or anything.|`|2EdVsgciaa	No way to skip unless you're on the pill or if you're irregular on it to begin with.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	Well, this is not the answer you are looking for, but there is a thing called a Diva Cup.  I found this when I attended a womens show at a convention centre.  It is amazing (if you can get used to it).  I takes awhile to get the knack of it, but I love it.  I feel like my periods are almost non-existant because the product works so well.  I feel like I am a salesperson everytime I talk about it, but I am not!!  <br>  <br>  Do a search on Diva Cup and check it out.  You can buy them at most health food stores I think, for about $40 and it pays for itself in no time as you do not have to buy tampons or pads again.

This can be common practice now, so no worries, although if you are a worrier like me you are obviously worried about it, but believe me, if it has been fine for 2 years...your fine!

Chances of necrosis (dead tissue) and amputation: any % is bad.    As for the hair it will depend on how severe is the scarring, BUT honestly, who wants to trade a big burn scar for some hair????    By the way the root of the hair is way deep under the skin so you would need to destroy a lot of tissue to get there and that's something very crazy to do.    EDIT     A "red hot peice of wire" that's a "third degree burn":    "This type of burn destroys the outer layer of skin (epidermis) and the entire layer beneath (or dermis).    symptoms..:  -- dry and leathery skin   -- black, white, brown, or yellow skin   -- swelling   -- lack of pain because nerve endings have been destroyed     ...third-degree burns heal slowly and poorly without medical attention. Because the epidermis and hair follicles are destroyed, new skin will not grow...."  http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/uva...|`|a0v3q3J4aa	There is a chance of scarring, but nothing terribly serious.  The hair will not grow back over scar tissue, but if antibiotic ointment and a band-aid is kept on it to keep germs/infection out, the injured should be fine.|`|xsZB4XDFaa	If it turns black (really badly burned) then you need to see the doctor.  Otherwise, it should not be too serious.  Is there a blister?  If there is a blister...you need to keep an eye on it.  DEFINITELY DON'T pop the blister.  That will open you up for infection.    You should be just fine if it was only a split second.    The hair should grow back in time.  It depends how bad the burn is to determine if it will scar.  Really depends.|`|LqLs6otzaa	Possible infection.  Some people can throw off infections, some can't, and require medicine.  Some people have even had limbs amputated because of infection not responding to treatment.  Scar, also.   Don't know about the hair.  Most people would be more concerned about their health, than their physical appearance from something like this.
goch9Twpaa	Hi,<br>  yes i tried it and I lost 12 pounds in 10days... And I ate bacon for breakfast every day! ;) No bullsh*t!|`|iTYVV3etaa	Nope.  That is a scam.<br>  <br>  Hey, do you want to lose weight easily by doing nothing or get motivated to lose weight easily without even giving up half-way?<br>   <br>  The key and answer to successfully do it is in Your Subconscious Mind.<br>   <br>  The subconscious actually stores a multitude of memory patterns which will feed information to the conscious mind when activated. Data is never erased unless the subconscious mind gives that command.<br>  For example, when you walk or drive to your destination, you do it automatically without being aware of it - that is your subconscious mind doing the whole process without your conscious mind.<br>  The subconscious brain is very good at its job and works 24 hours a day on keeping us alive.<br>   <br>  The subconscious controls and regulates involuntary functions of the body such as breathing, circulation, Metabolism, Digestion, hormone balance, etc.<br>   <br>  So you may wonder.. how do you tweak or make your subconscious mind to lose weight easily?  The answer is... Hypnosis! <br>   <br>  Hypnosis is done by bypassing your conscious mind to your subconscious mind giving instructions and storing them successfully.<br>  That is why people can quit smoking, feel extremely motivated, attain success easily, study easily and so on Successfully just after 1 session of hypnosis! Even faith-healing uses Hypnosis!<br>   <br>  You will thank me because I can guarantee you Hypnosis Works!  You can just let your natural metabolism be high and Lose Fat Doing NOTHING effectively and immediately or be motivated to stop binge eating and exercise regularly without pain or laziness!<br>   <br>  A good hypnosis site for losing weight:<br>  <a href="http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk" rel="nofollow">http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk</a>|`|a5Y0nQf0aa	No just watch we eat and by eating a healthy well balance diet everyday an get plenty of exercise is all we need.|`|sAwmwynnaa	by taking money from fat people (who they consider idiots) to sell them a rubbish diet.

Each thing is different and can have different implications for you depending on your health.    my personal opinion: massage once a week for a full body is the most that is necessary unless you are treating something specific and then the LICENCED therapist will develop a treatment plan that includes how often, etc. If it is purely for relaxation one hour, once a week to once a month is standard.|`|m3CdrNt7aa	According to Boscarino, there is no limit on the amount of visits that anyone can take to a day spa, but with the treatments and services sometimes reaching into the pricey range, many spa goers work on some sort of a regiment when need be.|`|e61b6f14e6d908535f36e113ec589f3caa	as often as you like as long as you can afford it|`|satoCRC6aa	its up to you  weekly is pro bally all one needs  don't over do a good thing|`|a48b8f799e030a044da781ffac6f94cdaa	As often as you can afford - how fantastic!|`|RA8PuTd5aa	you get dirty each day... but may be once a week to really have a good clean|`|f7c5f574e4f1a6efb425246391dcb433aa	almost never|`|yQdA5rHnaa	as much as you want or can afford

What is I believe  more helpful, is to find out why?

I also ate, mashed potatoes and noodle soups, milk shakes etc... I wasn't able to eat solid food for a while.

OUCH!<br>  <br>  :)  I wish you well, you'll be fine.... <br>  <br>  I couldn't stand the guaze in my mouth so I had to spit the blood out (I know it sounds gross but it's better to do that then have it make your stomach even more sick by keeping it in your mouth!)|`|KNYF1hnhaa	Well it is going to bleed for a while.  When I had mine taken out surgically they bled for about 6 hours.  You will get pain meds and anti infection meds as well.  The surgeon I went to was great.  He told me that as soon as I woke up I needed to bite down right away to keep the gauze in place so I did.  I was very woozy afterwords from being put to sleep and every now and then it was uncomfortable, but all in all it was much better than the pain I went through before the surgery.
BdlGBdE5aa	It will help for a short time, however, the peroxide and baking soda is like a mint or a gum.  It just covers up the bad breath.   To really get rid of bad breath you must get rid of the source of bad breath, the bacteria on the top of your tongue.  To check, just stick out your tongue and look for some "white stuff".  That is the bacteria.  I recently learned about bad breath and I have cured my bad breath.  I got a OraBrush tongue cleaner and some mouthwash and now I clean my tongue every time I brush my teeth.  Works really great.|`|hXYjkCGpaa	It can work for whitening. You have to be careful not to damage your enamel.

bfce3535711ead57385f04696462322baa	You should try a prescription treatment like Vermox, it is taken once and then repeated again a week later. Also you need to WASH WASH WASH your hands. Pinworms is spread through the fecal oral route, which means you need to do a better job washing your hands after using the restroom. Also wash all of your bedding, change your underwear everyday. The eggs stay under your fingernails and then you ingest them, they hatch in your digestive tract, and lay eggs in your anus that when you wipe or scratch because they can be quite itchy, if you dont wash your hands you start the cycle all over again!!

People think that having pin worms is a sign of being unhygienic - IT IS NOT - Don't worry, it is very very common in the UK.  You need to take another tablet 2 weeks after the first one because the tablet will not kill the eggs, and the eggs live for 2 weeks.  IF you do go to the doctor, he will usually not ask to do a test, because it is so common, and the same thing goes for that. To make sure you don't get reinfected, make sure to clip your nails are short as you can, so no eggs can transfer to you mouth and then the whole cycle is done again.  BTW Pinworms are also called threadworms - so if you go to a doctor/ pharmacistct make sure they know what you are talking about.|`|k91hDzu9aa	go to the doctor, get that one pill, take that one pill, use the bathroom, done.|`|maEk3Ui1aa	go at the doctors

This will also help restore your electrolyte balance a bit.     The headache is caused by low blood sugar. That and the dehydration can be quickly fixed by sports drinks such as Gatorade. Caffeine is also a generally effective headache remedy if the headache persists.

Alcohol is a very good diuretic, meaning it makes you urinate. You need to replenish your fluids during the evening you are consuming alcoholic beverages. 1 tonight is worth 2 in the morning!  Here is the last step, the final resort.

Avoiding tea, coffee, cola, smoking, red wine will reduce the amount of new stain.  Baking soda will not remove enamel.  The only way to whiten the actual color of the tooth itself is by bleaching.  There are some good products on the market or you can go to your dentist. Look for the percent of carbamide peroxide in the products.  The higher the percent the quicker teeth will whiten.  15% would be average but 20% is better. 30-35% is also available but probably only from the dentist. If it's not on the box check the internet.<br>  Beware of whitening toothpaste.  They are too abrasive and can wear away enamel which will make teeth more yellow.

Your prescription needs to be stable for at least 2-3 yrs.  It is usually best to wait til mid 20's.

This is rather like someone with third degree burns all over their body: they generally don't live.  a) You need your skin; it's the first barrier against infection, and provides a tremendous amount of the heat dissipation and some waste disposal through sweat.  b) That's a massive amount of injury and blood loss; any injury that severe and painful would be difficult to live through regardless of the type.  Your skin is your largest organ!<br>  <br>  Besides, your skin won't just "grow back" if removed.  Burn victims generally get skin grafts to replace the skin.

Things like that would irritate me to death because i had to have my way or no way at all and once i realized that i couldn't control all the things around me i sorta just let go of that sense of control then everything felt easier to deal with.

xnZi0i8saa	Is the Focalin helping with her symptons? If it is than she is ADHD. If it seems to make the symptoms worse, then she most likely has Bipolar disorder. My son is on Adderol XR for ADD and it helps with his symptoms. In the beginning he ate very little and slept very little but it did pass with time. Manic episodes from the Bipolar can also make someone sleep less....... Again, look at her symptoms, if the Focalin helps then give it a little time for the side effects to go away. If her symptoms are worse.... take her back to the doctor and see about trying a med for Bipolar mania.|`|3MM64geHaa	IT sure can.  Treating bipolar with ADHD medicine is foolish!   She probably is not biploar but you need to know. There are a couple of screenings at psychcentral.com you can take but I would want a professional opinion.|`|aNbYThzsaa	First to tell if she has bi-polar disorder is to see if she becomes manic on a stimulant. If she does not become manic she is not bi-polar. Mood swings and difficulty falling asleep are typical symptoms of stimulants and are NOT to be confused with bi-polar. never give bi-polar medication to an ADHD kid, they did that to me and I became more agitated and aggressive. It tends to bring out oppositional definat disorder and conduct disorder in ADHD kids. Ask her doctor about a sleep medication like rozerum. I have to take a sleep medication because if I dont, like your daughter I dont sleep. (It has nothing to do with bi-polar, its called insomnia.) I also take Focalin XR and too find it is very hard to sleep because of the extended release formula. Also if you are seeing a good doctor there is no evidence that bi-polar even exists in children under 18.
CLB32006aa	If you drink a lot of water and don't smoke too much and for too long, then you should still be clean. However, I would say that it would be more effective if you took it the day after or at the very least after you smoked instead.    Don't listen to the person above me if you are starting clean then a moderate smoke session will last usually around 3 days in your body. If you take niacin with a lot of water you will remove the THC from your body much faster and in greater amounts.     Hope this helps  Good luck :)|`|oojO4WAraa	You can smoke, but it won't get rid of the THC.  It take 30 days to get THC out of your system.|`|AA10634007	NO.  The only thing separating fact from fiction here is mere speculation.  Basically, at one time or another, someone associated the use of niacin and the omission of THC with a common purpose.  Niacin, in fact, promotes metabolic digestion of enzymes. When Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is absorbed into the body, it is automatically recognized by your system as waste.  It is digested and absorbed into the blood, causing the side effects marijuana is better associated with, such as "the munchies". Once the THC is absorbed, it is processed by the liver and stored in the colon to be primarily absorbed into the feces, about an 80/20 split with the urine (the urine being the 20% of course).  This is one of the primary reasons you can't drink your way out of a drug test.  In fact, THC's chemical compound BONDS with the acidic base of urine, otherwise known as glucuronic ester acid. Overdosing on niacin isn't deadly, but it is dangerous.  It can cause acid reflux or backwash, erratic heart beat and pulse, and over-the-top metabolic activity; further more, niacin has never actually been proven to even so much as "fool" a drug screen, let alone shoot it down.  If you've made it this far, I'll wrap it up with an overwhelming NO.|`|vSQRmm19aa	if your not a frequent smoker (only smoke once a week or once a month) that it should be gone in a couple of days without taking anything (gessing your an average person that exercises).      but if ur  a heavy smoker for years than yes it would take 30 days, also if u dont work out etc. u can drink a lot of water or try all the other **** (vineger, etc)       but detox works all the time, especially if your  on probation or parole (parolees dont get tested for bud usually)

Rub the tape to make sure it has a chance to stick and pull.   This usually works if not try something like Elmer's glue. Put a small amount, providing a thin layer over the area and let it dry. Then pull it off.   Both are common remedies that have worked for me, so hope it works for you as well! :)|`|HlD9dRF2aa	If you need to dig it out, soak your foot in water to soften the skin around it first, scrape with tweezers and go with duct tape over the exposed wood.
AA11599407	When we eat sugars and carbs they are converted to glucose which the cells need to survive. Glucose cannot enter a cell without the help of the hormone insulin. Insulin production occurs in the islets of langerhans located in the pancreas. When glucose levels rise the insulin is released and it escorts the glucose across the cell membrane to be used for energy. Obviously in diabetics little or no insulin is produced naturally so the glucose builds up and cannot be used by the cells. Therefore either medication to help the pancreas produce insulin is needed or if no insulin can be produced insulin needs to be taken by injection.

Just make sure that the company you get it from uses Molecular Distillation because that's currently the only safe way to remove any trace contaminants of any heavy metals.

Trazodone is prescribed for depression and anxiety- your symptoms could be anxiety related- however a rare side effect of Tricylic antidepressants can be cardiovascular side-effects such as changes in ECG ,arrhythmias, tachycardia and syncope (more common with high doses), what dose are you taking?

The type of sit-up you're doing has been determined to be very bad for the lower back, in fact the US Marines do not do them any more because of this. You want to do crunches only, not full sit-ups!<br>  <br>  After you get comfortable with crunches you can add more difficulty to them by holding your legs off the floor 2 inches. I typically do 4 sets of these, 50 reps. Trust me you'll have a 6 pack like me in no time, I've been doing these for years now and they work! I get compliments all the time.|`|oz2mOkmyaa	you DO NOT have to do crunches or sit-ups for a flat stomach!<br>  <br>  I would suggest turbulence training. it combines strength training(for building lean muscle tissue) and cardio(for fat burning). you don't need any fancy equipment or an expensive gym membership. <br>  <br>  example: squats, push-ups, pull-ups, mountain climbers(if you can't do a push-up or pull-up=> use dumbbells or resistance bands & do a pushing exercise and a pulling exercise instead). do 15 reps of each back to back to back to back without resting. that equals 1 set. rest 30-60 secs. repeat. do 3-5 complete sets. Do this 3-4x/week.<br>  <br>  If you noticed there are no sit-ups or crunches in this workout. the best way to burn fat and tighten up your midsection & core is through total body exercises!<br>  <br>  These workouts are great for women or men!<br>  <br>  good luck|`|4x8hiC1xaa	try this:<br>  insted of laying on ur back and straining ur muscles <br>   -stand up & put ur hands behind ur head like ur about 2 do a crunch<br>   - do the same movement that u would if u were on the floor doin a  crunch, use ur stomach tighten it and pull it in <br>  <br>  yea i kno it sounds funni but i do it all the time and it works <br>  <br>  hope it works 4 ya!<br>  :)

Good luck|`|6d7m0kWWaa	What meds have you tried?  Have you tried changing your diet?|`|ParFJxnSaa	View the techniques for control of anxiety/panic attacks, in section 8, at ezy build, below. Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious). Advice from a published psychiatrist on controlled breathing: (1.) Get a clock, or watch with a second timer. (2.) Practise for 5 minutes, 4 times daily, until proficient. (3.) Take a small breath in, and hold it, for 6 seconds. (4.) Think to yourself: "RELAX", just before breathing out. (5.) Try to feel a sense of releasing tension, as you breathe out. (6.) Breathe in for 3 seconds, then out, for 3 seconds. Try to make your breathing very smooth, and light, as you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, or nose. (7.) For the next minute, continue to breathe in, and out, every 3 seconds. (8.) Go back to step 3, at the end of the minute, and proceed through to step 7, doing this for 5 minutes. Use this at the very first sign of a panic attack starting, or any time you feel anxious, or tense. Similar, but simpler advice, from a clinical psychologist is to breathe in to the count of 3: (one thousand one; one thousand two; one thousand three) each takes around a second to say to yourself, in your mind. Then breathe out to the count of 3. Repeat, until it begins to take effect. Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6, [page N first] or 42, [page i first] respectively). <br>  <br>  The paper bag method also works for most people, but is not suited to all circumstances, such as driving, or playing sport. Another alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause, which is usually anxiety; read section 1, and examine the <a href="http://1-800-therapist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1-800-therapist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/choose/</a> websites, and use the locators to find a therapist, (and phone book, but only if necessary). I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them, which is enough for some people. Visualise as vividly as possible, a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to us either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack.<br>  <br>  Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising - saying it to yourself in your mind). Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, which requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. Imagine that the cause of your panic; your anxieties, fears, your self doubts, self recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids"; every painful "I-can't-do-it" are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by.|`|ad7ae5e8f17688d3566fad454e8fc09baa	I have the same problem that ended up landing me in the hospital.

This is what can cause cold sores. Cold sores commonly occurs on the mouth but it can be passed to the genitals.  HSV2 is commonly referred to as genital herpes. It causes painful sores or blisters to break out on the genitals but under the right conditions it can be passed to the mouth.  There is not much difference between the two as they both come from the same herpes virus, they are just different strains.  All you have to do is avoid kissing if he has an oral out break and avoid oral and regular sex when he has a genital out break.

Wash your hands frequently, do not share food or drink, and do not touch a blister, then touch others or other areas of your body. Use sunscreen when outdoors to avoid sun-related outbreaks.

DaFkM3qNaa	Asbestos is a natural mineral made of fibers known for its excellent fire-resistant and insulation properties, resistance to chemicals, and amazing strength. There are six recognized asbestos mineral fibers which can be found all over the world and they are: amosite, crocidolite, tremolite, actinolite, anthophyllite, and chrysotile. <br>  <br>  Amosite, crocidolite, tremolite, actinolite, and anthophyllite consist of needle-like fibers and belong to the "amphibole" type of asbestos. Chrysolite, which is the most common asbestos, is made up of curly fibers from the "serpentine" type of asbestos, and has been banned from most countries except the US and Europe.<br>  <br>  Asbestos was commonly used for home heat insulation and for many other purposes up until the late 80's when it was revealed to be extremely hazardous to your health! Today, it still exists in older buildings, making it a wise choice to "test for asbestos" when considering the purchase of an old structure.<br>  <br>  Long-term asbestos exposure has been known to cause several types of diseases aside from deadly ones such as mesothelioma, asbestosis, and lung cancer as described above. Asbestos warts can be caused through repeated fiber penetration of the skin, causing hard, unsightly wart-like nodules.<br>  <br>  If asbestos fibers become airborne in your home or work area, and you breathe these fibers consistently for prolonged span of days, months, or years, you stand a much greater chance of eventually suffering from one of the three deadly diseases. Merely being exposed once or twice to asbestos is not known to pose an immediate or long-term health threat.|`|LcURWscBaa	Try a search engine.  Your assignment is not to ask others what to say.|`|AA11537248	"Asbestos?  I eat the stuff!  I put a little mustard on it and I eat it!"<br>  --The Jerky Boys, pranking an asbestos removal company.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  There are 2 different kinds of asbestos: friable and non-friable.<br>  <br>  The non-friable stuff is mostly harmless.  It's most frequently seen in siding on old houses.  Non-friable means that when you break it, it doesn't give off the fibers that can be inhaled.  To remove it, just wet it and pull it down.<br>  <br>  The friable stuff is more dangerous.  When it breaks, it gives off thousands of little fibers than can be inhaled.  The fibers do not break down once inside the body, and can lead to mesothelioma, a usually fatal lung disease.  Friable asbestos is most often used as insulation.<br>  <br>  Removing asbestos safely is very expensive.  The area has to be carefully contained and the workers have to wear "moon suits" to keep the fibers from entering their airways.  Then, the removed asbestos needs to be properly disposed.<br>  <br>  A safe alternative to removing friable asbestos isto encapsulate it in a plastic to seal in the fibers, and just leave it in place.  This is usually far more cost effective and safer for the workers.|`|9GmoO5NLaa	If you win this then you are fantastic at debating!<br>  <br>  "Due to their mineralogical properties of having high strength, being an excellent insulator for heat and electricity, being able to resist heat without damage, being fairly good at resisting corrosion, and also having the ability to be woven into fabric, asbestos has been added to many different materials commonly used in buildings and different products. It can be found in literally thousands of types of products from building fireproofing to hand-held hair dryers."<br>  <br>  or try this;<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mindfully.org/Pesticide/Dioxin-Harmless-Asbestos-Good.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindfully.org/Pesticide/Dioxi...</a><br>  Hope this helps

It really only has one 'O'.|`|CciXZNYraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  ? Avoid those vending machines by carrying around your own healthful foods and leaving pocket change at home.<br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|407W7yOsaa	Eat regular meals.<br>  Skip food containing oil, fat, sugar and drinks with sugar.<br>  Don't eat till full just keep to moderate quantity.<br>  Drink a lot of water to make your feel full.<br>  Fruits are good substitute too.|`|0Iin6kO4aa	Start doing housework, after the first week do it at more rapid passe <br>  you should loose a lot of weight and your house will be clean as well.|`|kYgblA7Faa	do cardio like go joggin and wat not|`|dclLTjqFaa	First of all if you want to loose weight and keep it off dont do any stupid crash dieting because you wont be able to stick to it long term and will put the weight back on.

Try to limit snacks between meals and if you want something get a drink instead or a cup of tea and you might not feel the need to eat something then. Drink lots of water also.

Usually you can get a whole days worth of fiber (25g for a women) very quickly just by eating some cereal, fruit and a fiber one bar.

84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	We were NOT designed to be vegetarian, but it is possible to be one for a while and still maintain reasonable health.  One of the most notable vegetarians and outspoken proponents of that life style who wrote books on the subject was Pavlov Areola.  He died at 62 of a stroke.      Primitive people and even Neandrathal's that were not in the human species line over 30,000 years ago were primarily meat eaters.  It was about 12,000 years ago when man started farming, but even then the primary diet was meat from wild animals and wild fish from the oceans and lakes.  Sugar was introduced about 400 years ago and refined sugar, white flour, hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated oils were introduced about 100 years ago.  Vegetable oils and synthetic vitamins were introduced around 1915, as was modern dentistry.    At no time in history have we been under such great attack from the food we eat as we are today.  The result is great sickness.  So called modern agriculture has destroyed most of the quality of foods being grown and processed foods and animal feeds being fed to animals have all but destroyed any nutrients that used to be there to protect us from these illnesses.  Eating organic foods is a big step in the right direction, but even many of those are grown in bad soil.    Did you know that primitive people did NOT get cavities or even have plaque build up on their teeth and were very resistant to diseases like T.B.?    3/4 of your immune system can be found in the gut as friendly bacteria.  Antibiotics ("anti" = against "biotics" = life) destroy that flora and along with it, 3/4 of your immune system.  Another 10% of the immune system can be found in the peyer's patches in your small intestines, but that is quickly used up due to the toxic load being placed on your body by bad foods being consumed.    Many primitive people ate mostly meat, but to preserve foods like dairy and vegetables, they fermented them.  These are the same bacteria that make up 3/4 of your immune system.  Eating these foods will greatly enhance your immunity to disease, just like it did them.  The problem is that you need to make them yourself and NOT rely on commercially made junk being sold in the Mausoleums where dead food is held in state.  One small little container of Yoplait yogurt for instance, has 27 grams of sugar, pasteurized dairy and if it weren't so pitiful, it would be funny.  Eating 16 of those "cups" will give you 1 pound of sugar!  The pasteurization kills the bacteria, so what value can you receive from that?  Not immunity.    Raw dairy products contain bacteria that helps you digest your food and the FRIENDLY BACTERIA that supports good immunity.  Pasteurization, radiation, chemical preservatives, all contribute to killing off these good bacteria nature spent eons creating for us to consume.  Rather than making cows healthy, our government has chosen to allow sick animals produce milk and then destroy the milk so it can be consumed.  That does NOT promote good immunity for anyone and in fact, causes many diseases.    Eggs are the only food that ALL Animals will eat universally.  Yet, we are told to not eat the yolks where all the vitamins and minerals of the egg are found.  Why?  Ignorance is the only answer.  Could all the other animals in the world be wrong?  We are told that breast milk is the most perfect food for babies, yet it contains over 50% saturated fat that we are told is bad for us.  Did nature get it wrong?      We are told meat is bad for us, but how did the primitive people not get cavities, have great jaw formation, be resistant to disease and live so healthily eating mostly meat?  The animals ate good food that we simply have to struggle to find thanks to our food and agricultural industries today.    Even the supplements sold in stores are mostly junk and actually damage the body.  All the "B" vitamins sold in pharmacies, health food stores, etc. are made from the petroleum distillates, coal tar that are nothing but dead chemicals that damage your DNA.    Yes, there is good food and vitamins / minerals to be found, but very difficult in America today where profit is king and quality is just a word used by marketing geniuses.      Making homemade saurkraut, homemade yogurt and kefir from raw milk (from cows fed grass, not grains), avoiding sugar, white flour, hydrogenated oils, can all contribute greatly to improving your immune system.  And, especially, avoiding antibiotics, all vaccinations, and drugs in general will greatly improve your immune system.    good luck to you|`|cqzZjRVwaa	No offence but if vegetarians won't eat meat because "they don't want to kill animals", then how is it acceptable to kill fish? Isn't fish an animal? You need meat in your diet for a source of protein. However, tuna is a good substitute if you really do not want to eat meat.    Hope I helped!|`|57fZyjvgaa	Hey... to give your immune system a boost, make sure you get lots of Vitamin C and B-vitamins.   If you need a good boost you can get those "emergen-c" packets at the store that you mix with liquid and drink (i know health food stores have them, not sure about regular grocery stores).   You should probably be taking vitamin b-12 - the type that dissolves under your tongue is best.  "Green pills" are good for vegetarians who don't always get the veggies needed (as in people who aren't about health, more about just not eating meat and who eat mostly gluten products and junk). Those will help your immune system as well. They're little pills that are basically packed with vegetables!    Getting protein as a vegetarian can be hard. Eat at least a handful of nuts (preferably not peanuts - more like almonds) everyday and you'll get protein and keep your arteries in great condition! I'm guessing you're not vegan, so try to eat eggs for protein as well.  ..........................  Patrick - not all vegetarians eat fish, and not all people are vegetarians to "not kill the animals." You can't generalize when it comes to vegetarians, people have various reasons for doing it and different styles of doing it.|`|8DN2jyRsaa	the only way is to eat meat,you'll be healthier too|`|ZKw46efXaa	patrick smith - what are you talking about, nobody has said anything about fish!!    eat a lot of various foods, i,e nuts, fruit, veg etc. I am a veggie and i take vitamins especially for veggies to make sure i get all the goodness i need.|`|gBxp933Daa	The best thing you can possibly do is eat healthy (in a vegetarians case lots of nuts, quorn and other veggie things high in protein) the natural herb euchinasia (i think that's how you spell it) has been proven to increase your immune system along with almost every green tea out there that you can buy.

(google for benefits to vegetarians)|`|oImpZnOCaa	I have many ways to boost your immune system, it does not matter if you are vegetarian or not.  Sorry this answer may be long, but you asked.    Some  is by recognizing what caused your immune system to get weak, then avoiding those things as much as possible. Before I share many ways to boost your immune system, take a look at some possible reasons why our immune system gets weak.    1) Toxins: Most people today have excess accumulation of toxins and waste material in their bodies causing their body to be acidic and adding stress to their immune system function. The two main reasons for this is  a) People are putting huge amounts of toxins (mostly unknowingly) in their bodies on a regular basis and  b) their elimination channels are clogged, slow or sluggish.  c) toxins like "junk" food, medications(drugs), sugars, excess alcohol, allergens all stress your immune system, thus making it weak and unable to fight the germs when exposed to them.    2) Nutritional Deficiency:  When your body lacks nutrition, you will have a weak immune system.  Since our bodies can not produce nutrients needed for optimal health, quality food plays a major factor in keeping our cells healthy and our immune system strong. Food not only provides energy to your body, but all the nutrients that are essential for a healthy immune system.    3) Lack of drinking healthy water:  Dehydration means the cells just simply do not have enough fluid. Dehydration cause medical problems including pain, arthritis, asthma, and allergies, among other medical issues. It can affect your energy and your sleep, and the ability to get toxins/waste material out of the body.    4) Lack of physical activity:  Lack of regular, moderate exercise appears to slow down cleansing the body of certain toxins and waste products    5) Lack of sufficient rest:  lack of sleep will stress your immune system and thus increase the risk of catching a bug.    6) Chronic stress  People who are under chronic stress have lower than normal white blood cell counts, are more vulnerable to colds and other viruses and take longer to recover from them. They are more likely to experience more severe symptoms than people who are not under a great deal of stress.    The good news is you can strengthen your immune system by doing as many of the following list as possible....    1) get plenty of rest. During deep sleep, our body release potent immune-enhancing substances that strengthen your immune system function. By not allowing our body sufficient rest, the immune system will sputter, and as a result, not function at full capacity. We then are more likely to become ill with common illnesses. A healthy, deep sleep allows our body to release a significant amount of growth hormone that boost the immune system and aids in the growth and repair of the body.    2) get moderate and regular exercise  An increase in blood flow associated with moderate exercise helps to circulate antibodies along with white blood cells necessary to fight infection more quickly. As a result, this provides our bodies with an early warning system to ward off potentially damaging germs. In addition, the increase in body temperature as a result of physical activity may aid in inhibiting the growth of bacteria; thus allowing the body to fight infection more effectively.    3) Detox Your Body  Body cleansing is essential because our bodies need to properly eliminate the toxic build up that has formed in our intestines (colon), which may lead to sickness and disease. Our body organs and tissues must be free of toxins for the immune system to function optimally thus enabling our bodies to receive the essential nutrients our bodies need.    4) Boost immune system by drinking plenty of alkaline water.  Water is essential for all living things and keeps our immune system operating optimally while improving the way we feel, look and live. Without sufficient amounts of water, you may experience routine fatigue, dry skin, headaches, constipation, and a decrease normal bodily function which may lead to your body unable to fight off diseases. Without water we would literally dehydrate which could result in the shutting down of vital organs and ultimately end in death.    5) Eliminate all sugar and allergens from your diet.  Just a small amount of sugar has been proven to impair white blood cells up to 50% for very short periods of time. By discovering what our personal food allergies are, then eliminating or desensitizing them will help strengthen your immune system. By removing these triggers, our immune cells are strengthened in order to combat other invaders such as influenza rather than the allergen. The elimination of sugar from your diet can also strengthen immune system.    6) Eat nutritiously  Good foods to eat include organic fruits and vegetables,  Stay away from junk food like pop, bake goods, any processed foods. Bad foods contain stuff like refined sugar, sodium nitrite, Trans fats, Mono-sodium glutamate (MSG), A
phAqOpzZaa	clearly...they are not mature enough...to be proud for the job nurses do...they work a lot of hours and hardly have time to be at home w/there family...they clearly need to find another job then...
mAiRFAfsaa	I get it sometimes, usually when I get up really fast and stretch. The feeling is weird, I hate the pressure you get on your head. But I'm not too sure either, I just thought it was some kind of dizziness and punishment for rushing your body into a state of strict movement when it isn't ready.|`|gb4VzNXQaa	Usually it's because of low blood sugar from not eating for several hours.  The pain is caused by a dilation of  the blood vessels in your head caused by the low blood sugar and the dizziness is another common symptom.  Just eat some breakfast and you'll feel better.|`|o3tA2ORIaa	yes thats perfectly normal, i think, it means uve had a good sleep|`|8633819078b00cbb5eec79ed6aeb5cf4aa	I think you need to try getting off the bed a bit slower and check your blood count. You could be lacking iron in your body. :) hope you feel better
6k5fhFyBaa	I'd still crutch around until your ankle has had time to heal. Walking on an injury only causes more damage thus creating longer healing time and possible permanent problems.
KNYF1hnhaa	Hmmm I would say that you need to see a real doctor.  We can all say what we think it might be but only a doctor can diagnose what it is and treat it properly.|`|6d7m0kWWaa	Everything except for your throat hurting is the direct result of a fever.  You could have the flu, or strep, or just about anything else that makes your throat hurt.<br>  -edit-<br>  Actually, nevermind strep.  Your throat would be hurting a lot of you had strep.
Kaudz4Msaa	Yes, it's transmissible.  But it's not as serious as the much more dangerous HIV or anything.  Up to 80% of adult American women have it.  However, it's not a death sentence.  The medical industry wants more excuse to make money off of the vaccine for it, so they are trying to force it on all young women.  But HPV, if treated, is NOT dangerous.  The vaccine, on the other hand, is still unproven over time.    I had HPV.  It showed up as an "abnormal pap."  It wasn't that bad.  I never would have felt it or known I had it.  I just had to have it monitored.  If the abnormal pap smears had kept up for more than two or three times, then they would have scraped my cervix with a "LEEP."  However, the infection resolved on its own.  Most of them do.  The reason the doctors keep monitoring the cervix after abnormal pap smears is that sometimes, rather than resolving, the infection can turn into cervical cancer.  (By the way, even cervical cancer, if caught early enough and removed, is not a death sentence...it's one of the least fatal forms.)    So, please don't worry.  HPV does not equal cancer.  You probably had it.  You may have had it before.  It's just random that she happened to notice and call you.  Most women have it.  And, it doesn't hurt men AT ALL.    Note to person above who mentions herpes:  HERPES HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HPV.|`|Px79AEXtaa	it's a virus and yes, you can be a carrier now.  it causes cervical cancer in women and can cause genital warts in men and women.  now you know why you need condoms every time.  you should call your doctor for medical advice.|`|1hciyvKdaa	I had never heard of this until they showed on tv girls are suppose to get this shot, they do not ever mention guys on the news. Support you friend through this time, shes probably really scared, and needs to see and hear from her friends.|`|VBMOuIuxaa	no in men, you lucky bastards have HPV but it is assymptomatic. in women, it is not necessarily DEFINITE cancer, but could be if she does not have it monitored periodically. you have nothing to worry about!|`|7bnQmXksaa	Simple answer HPV is warts .. usually does not become cancer in males. Yes you can get it and you may or may not show signs. if you have had unprotected interaction you may already ahve it and you can spread it.      Its dangerous for women because it does in a lot of cases turn into cancer. Sorry i wish I had better news.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	hpv is in effect a broad range of terms ranging from herpes to warts. it can remain undetected for years. so go and get tested. your ex did the right thing by contacting you. that is very responsible of her. go and get checked.|`|vqoeNwvXaa	You can get it, but there's no link to it in men.  There is no test for it, so you won't know if you get it.  For men, the only way to prevent it is using protection.  It can cause a multitude of problems.  For now, if you have it, it's too late.  If you don't, use protection.  You most likely won't know if you have it until something goes wrong, but then again, nothing may go wrong. She should have gotten the preventative shot, but for guys there's no prevention shot.  Then again, for guys, it won't cause cancer (at least that we know yet)
AA12196812	It's been 4 years since I moved and stopped being a member. Back then, I think I was paying something like $38 a month, but there were much better deals available if you were willing to commit to longer memberships. They may wave the enrolllment fees and all that if they feel like it. Make sure to ask.<br>  <br>  It's a pretty nice facility.
rJgrwIodaa	Yes.  Some eye doctors prescribe them as one month lenses.  The companies call them two-week lenses because they want to make more money on them.  I would still recommend taking them out every night, even though I think those are the ones that are okay to sleep in.  It will make the lenses last longer and will prevent any irritation to your eyes.|`|gLaGM8bYaa	I wear the Acuvue Oasys contacts with Hydraclear Plus and must reluctantly admit that I have at times worn them for longer than 2 weeks (almost a month). However, I should note that I rarely wear any makeup and I am not in an environment where my eyes get exposure to irritants.  Saving money is great, but as you said, you don't want to do something that my be harmful to your eyes. You really should follow the instructions that were given to you by your doctor.

Rk46lIBwaa	In sexually active women of child bearing age, statistically the commonest cause of late periods remains pregnancy and you should do a test, even though you think you had a period last month.<br>  <br>  If this is negative it is possible that the delay is a simple hormone hiccough.|`|1KPUQMMxaa	you can still be pregnant and still get your period might want to test yourself my friend had her period all through her one pregnancy and it would come late but every month she had the visitor|`|9OyIL8P9aa	There are so many things that can make your period late. <br>  These things are:<br>  not eating right<br>  stress<br>  different medications<br>  weight gain or loss<br>  <br>  Just take a deep breath, wait a  few more days, and then if it still is not here, go and get a home pregnancy test and if that comes up as negative then get to the doctor just to see what is going on. <br>  I am sure that it will come. Just try and not stress about it . <br>  Hope this helps.|`|4be79ced02832692d35eea2a9d53f382aa	are you eating normally? are you stressed out? these can cause your period to be late.

TKNPveHDaa	You can't really improve fitness quickly.  You can put in the time and effort and build your strength over a period of time.<br>  <br>  Practice jogging.  Move at a pace faster then a walk, but not a run.  When you get crampy and you can't breathe, keep working and try to go as long as possible.  If you have to stop, keep walking.  Walk fast and get your breath back.  Then kick it up to a jog again.  Put in 30-40 minutes three times a week.  In a month, you'll be much better.|`|AA12302661	Aerobics usually does the trick..

And waiting for the surgery or waiting during the surgery?<br>  <br>  My father-in-law had a stress test on a Tuesday and open heart surgery with a sextuple bypass the next day. The wait was around 8 hours I think? I can't really remember that part.|`|lmT3zXa9aa	The waiting period will depend on the serious nature of the condition.  Obviously if a person has gone to the hospital with chest pain and there is a blockage then the surgery will take place almost immediately or within a day or so.<br>  If it is something such as a replacement valve then it could be a few weeks or a months depending on the severity of the problem.|`|9be833f80702480a274e16bce800ad67aa	The hospital I work at....there is no wait...If needed right away it will be done right away.

It only lasts a short time, but keeps happening over and over durring the durration, sometimes and hour, sometimes all day. I've had it now for 15 years or so, and sometimes its very scarry. Not sure if you are having the same kind of thing or not. I can go for months not having them or go for several days straight. I've had MRI's and stuff but no such lick on them knowing anything. I also have a long story I wont share here that was very scarry with me in the emergency room cause of these pains when the pains had gotten worse cause of a car accicent and they were trying to get my girlfriends signature on a form that said exploritory sergery for/on my brain.

IKakoOfyaa	An MD is a medical doctor.  A DO is an osteopathic doctor.<br>  <br>  Similarities:<br>  <br>  Applicants to both DO and MD colleges typically have a four-year undergraduate degree with an emphasis on science courses.<br>  <br>  Both DOs and MDs complete four years of basic medical education.<br>  <br>  After medical school, both DOs and MDs can choose to practice in a specialty area of medicine—such as psychiatry, surgery, obstetrics, or sports medicine—after completing a residency program (typically two to six years of additional training).<br>  <br>  Both DOs and MDs must pass comparable state licensing examinations.<br>  <br>  DOs and MDs both practice in fully accredited and licensed hospitals and medical centers.<br>  <br>  Both are medical doctors; MD is specifically Doctor of Medicine and DO is Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine.<br>  <br>  Differences:<br>  <br>  DOs can perform surgery, child delivery, treat patients, and prescribe medications in hospitals and clinic settings. <br>  <br>  DOs look at the "total person." Osteopathic physicians focus on preventive care. Instead of just treating specific symptoms or illnesses, they look at the whole body. <br>  <br>  DOs receive extra training in the musculoskeletal system, which is comprised of the nerves, muscles, and bones. This training gives DOs a better understanding of how an injury or illness in one part of the body can affect another part of the body; therefore, DOs have a therapeutic and diagnostic advantage.<br>  <br>  DOs use what is called osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT). OMT is a technique in which the DOs use their hands to diagnose injury and illness, giving special attention to the joints, bones, muscles, and nerves. Manipulations improve circulation, which in turn, creates a normal nerve and blood supply, enabling the body to heal itself.
nR0dxezGaa	I think media has drilled it into our heads that big boobs are sexy. Women want to look desirable to men so they do what they feel they need to do.

Have a look at the women on commercials, on the covers of magazines, everywhere- constantly we are sold this idea that the 'ideal woman' has a figure like an anorexic 18-year-old with beach balls duct-taped to her chest (okay, I'm exaggerating a bit, but still).  It's disgusting- both the image, and the way society forces it into our heads.<br>  <br>  That said, I don't think there's anything wrong with a naturally large bust.  Or a naturally small one, either.  We need to start telling each other that it's okay just to be yourself.|`|LW9bu929aa	I have heard this a lot. I dont have the biggest boobs in the world and I could never want surgery to make them bigger. I was once insecure about them and would ask guy friends what they liked and all have said small, natural.

This all can be small med to large to X large some are of course implants and most women who do this is for a reason not just to have giant boobs as you say. Some have this done because on side is smaller or not the same shape as the other some do this because they had to have one removed for other reasons some do for pure attention some do for fun to see how far they can go with this and all is stress ful but all women are different like men some like small some like huge some don't care either way and like a female for her style, her sense of humor  her personalty alot of reasons not sole for the size of the boobs...|`|sVQ0IB0Gaa	I used to be an a cup before kids. now I'm a d cup.

According to my doctor, anti-depressants can be harmful in the sense that they enable someone who's already thinking about suicide to do it. When someone's incredibly low and unmotivated, they have more trouble going through with it. Anti-depressants can make people act on what they're already feeling.     Anywayyy, to me it sounds like you're definitely experiencing depression. I went through the exact things you've listed: crying, voluntary seclusion, constant fatigue, irritability, fights/avoidance of friends and family.     I would make an appointment with a psychiatrist A.S.A.P to discuss what your next move should be.He or she might be able to tell you what you should do as far as medicines and then refer you to a therapist.|`|7AfEG5rWaa	some anti depressants make certain individuals feel worse, thats why in the side affects they list suicide. go to your doctor and explain this. i just stopped taking mine because i can't afford them. i hate life, but i'm not going to kill myslef|`|ycjhPITiaa	Honey, I hope you get better!

My boyfriend had been cheating on me and the way I found out just pushed me over the edge.  A teenage girl showed up on his door with her three friends saying she was pregnant with his baby, and it just devastated me. I broke into tears and left. Later on while he and I were talking he denied sleeping with her and that it was his baby. (He did and it was)  I no longer cut over men, it's simply not worth it. <br>  <br>  After I cut I feel ashamed. Because I know people can usually see some of the marks, as well as some of the scars underneath. <br>  <br>  I suffer from depression. I'm not using that as the only reason I cut though. A lot of other factors cause me to. I'm lonely a lot. I do it a lot if I've been drinking. It gives me an odd high that blocks a lot of the emotional pain. <br>  <br>  I haven't cut in 194 days and going strong. I find myself compulsively cleaning or doing anything to keep my mind busy.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL.

Avoid fatty food.|`|CciXZNYraa	Don't eat late at night. <br>  Eating late at night can cause you to store more fat in your waist and stomach. Stop eating 3 hours before you go to bed. If you need a snack, eat something healthy like a piece of fruit or a handful of nuts (unsalted). <br>  Eat often, but in small portions. The less your body peaks and falls on the blood sugar scale, the less likely it will be to overeat and/or store unwanted fat. Ideally, cut calories, but don’t starve yourself. If you eat the right foods and eat often enough, you won’t find yourself eating huge portions and overeating in general.<br>  Eat fats like fish oil, sunflower oil, flax seed oil. Also whole grains, legumes, and vegetables and limiting meats. Ease up on the salt and gassy foods that cause you to bloat.<br>  <br>  <br>  Get out and move. After what you put in your mouth, what you do with your body will determine if you can flatten your belly. Get at least 30 minutes of cardio exercise every day, along with a properly executed abdominal workout. Train your body with strength training activities. Adding muscle tone will help you perform all daily activities as well.<br>  <br>  You can also try these exercises:<br>  <br>  Belly rolls strengthen your vertical abdominal muscles. Sit with your legs bent, with feet flat on the floor and arms straight in front of you. Exhale and roll back until your lower back touches the ground and stop for a moment. Inhale and roll back up. Repeat 15 times. <br>  In the same position, exhale and roll back until your shoulder blades touch the ground and momentarily stop. Inhale and roll back up. Repeat 15 times. <br>  <br>  Tummy curls work on your horizontal abdominal muscles. Lie on your back and bend your knees at an (almost) 90-degree angle to the floor with your feet raised slightly higher than your knees. Breathe out, lifting your butt and rolling back to your shoulder blades. Inhale and roll to your tailbone and stop. Try not to let your bottom touch the ground. Repeat 20 times. <br>  <br>  Cross crunches are hard work but they're miracle workers at cinching waists. You will need a liter bottle filled with water for this one. Lie on your back with your knees bent at a 90-degree angle with the floor. With your left hand cradling your head, hold the water bottle in your right hand. Lift your head and shoulders off the ground and reach across your body, so the bottle is outside your left knee. Pulse 20 times and then switch sides and repeat. <br>  <br>  Tailbone lifts work your lower abdomen and can help reduce a belly pouch. Lay on your back, with your arms stretched straight over your head and legs fully extended and crossed in the air. While breathing out, lift your tailbone then slowly lower as you inhale. To get maximum effect from this, don't let your bum just drop, you want to resist on the way down. Repeat 30 times. <br>  <br>  This is a favorite of mine as inverted crunches work your lower back which improves posture and strength. Lie on your belly with your arms in front of you as though you are flying like Superman. Exhale, lifting your right arm and left leg as high as you can. As you inhale, lower slowly. Switch, lifting your left arm and right leg. Repeat 20 times. <br>  In the same position, lift both arms and legs twenty times.<br>  <br>  Burn your belly fat by doing sit and reach exercise. <br>  Running and dancing early in the morning. <br>  Simple stretching and jumping when you wake up in the morning.|`|AA12302661	Drink a lot of water which can stop your hunger for biscuits or sweets.

Data is never erased unless the subconscious mind gives that command.<br>  For example, when you walk or drive to your destination, you do it automatically without being aware of it - that is your subconscious mind doing the whole process without your conscious mind.<br>  The subconscious brain is very good at its job and works 24 hours a day on keeping us alive.<br>   <br>  The subconscious controls and regulates involuntary functions of the body such as breathing, circulation, Metabolism, Digestion, hormone balance, etc.<br>   <br>  So you may wonder.. how do you tweak or make your subconscious mind to lose weight easily?  The answer is... Hypnosis! <br>   <br>  Hypnosis is done by bypassing your conscious mind to your subconscious mind giving instructions and storing them successfully.<br>  That is why people can quit smoking, feel extremely motivated, attain success easily, study easily and so on Successfully just after 1 session of hypnosis!

I could be driving a BMW for that price.  The most important thing is keeping watch on your CD4 count.  Anything below 400 is dangerous.  I'm at 1000+ which is abnormal but good for me.  Also, you need an excellent health care provider and a support system.  Read as much as you can because believe me, it's a hard thing to deal with especially in the first year or so and your friend will need you.

Most fullblown AIDS patients die of pneumonia from one of these secondary infections.  <br>  <br>  It isn't casually contagious; it takes pretty direct contact to infect you -- generally through blood-to-blood (like shared hypodermics) or sexual contact with someone infected.  It takes about 5 years, as I recall, to go from infection to fullblown AIDS, which is why this disease is so insidious: you might go out and have sex with a guy who seems fine, but infects you, since he won't show symptoms (outside of HIV tests) for years yet.<br>  <br>  That being said, there's quite a lot of good treatments out there that suppress the HIV virus; with proper medication and consistent treatment, most people can go on and live normal lives.  The catches are, of course, that they have to be very careful not to infect others -- "safe sex" becomes VERY safe sex (one would hope) -- and the medicines are quite expensive.  The last information I read stated that it cost about $1,000 a month to treat and suppress AIDS.  And HIV never goes away; no cure is in sight -- it's a lifelong condition.

However, you need to keep the crown on the tooth until you see a dentist as, if the tooth shifts, then the crown won't fit.  There are a couple of ways you can do this but the easiest is to get some denture adhesive from the drug store and place a VERY SMALL amount all around on the inside edges of the crown and then put it back on the tooth.  The adhesive will hold it in place and allow your dentist to remove it with no problem.  If you do this though, before you go to bed, try to get the crown off [use a piece of cloth to grasp the slippery thing!] so you don't swallow or inhale it.

The major and arguably only abnormal feature of RBD is loss of muscle atonia (paralysis) during otherwise intact REM sleep (the stage of sleep in which most vivid dreaming occurs). This loss of motor inhibition leads to a wide spectrum of behavioural release during sleep. This extends from simple limb twitches to more complex integrated movements where sufferers appear to be unconsciously acting out their dreams. These behaviours are often violent in nature and commonly result in injury to either the patient or their bed partner. Injuries range from bruises and cuts to fractures, subdural hematoma and other serious injuries. In contrast, all other aspects of sleep appear similar to normal.<br>  <br>   The most comprehensive assessment so far has estimated RBD prevalence to be around 0.5% in individuals aged 15-100. It is far more common in males: most studies report that only around a tenth of sufferers are female. This may be due to a referral bias, as violent activity carried out by men is more likely to result in harm and injury and is more likely to be reported than injury to male bed partners by women, or it may reflect a true difference in prevalence as a result of genetic or androgenic factors. The mean age of onset is estimated to be around 60 years of age. <br>  <br>  Various conditions are very similar to RBD in that sufferers exhibit excessive sleep movement and potentially violent behaviour. Such disorders include sleepwalking and sleep terrors, which are associated with other stages of sleep, nocturnal seizures and obstructive sleep apnea which can induce arousals from REM sleep associated with complex behaviours. Because of the similarities between the conditions, polysomnography plays an important role in confirming RBD diagnosis.<br>  <br>  It is now apparent that RBD appears in association with a variety of different conditions. Narcolepsy has been reported as a related disorder. This is unsurprising, as both RBD and narcolepsy involve dissociation of sleep states probably arising from a disruption of sleep control mechanisms. RBD has also been reported following cerebrovascular accident and neurinoma (tumour), indicating that damage to the brain stem area may precipitate RBD. RBD is usually chronic, however may be acute and sudden in onset if associated with drug treatment or withdrawal (particularly with alcohol withdrawal) 60% of RBD is idiopathic. This includes RBD that is found in association with conditions such as Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, where it is often seen to precede the onset of neurodegenerative disease. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonergic synaptic reuptake inhibitors, and noradrenergic antagonists can induce or aggravate RBD symptoms and should be avoided in patients with RBD.<br>  <br>            RBD is a treatable condition. The standard therapy is the anti-convulsant drug clonazepam, and this is generally received very well. How this drug works to restore REM atonia is unclear, however it is thought to suppress muscle activity, rather than directly restoring atonia.

Afraid that for now  you are simply stuck with it.   You can ask your doctor for a prescription for valtrex, but as advanced as the sore is now, that will only shorten it's duration a little, it will not heal it up quickly.|`|7R7e6yX5aa	suck on a tea bag|`|nXZUOJ20aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  In my opinion just keep putting zovirax on it, don't pop it or anything. If its still really bad, ask your mum if she can take you to the doctors tomorow, because it must be really painful.<br>  <br>  Thanks x|`|j0QyuiB0aa	Cut it with a knife it really works and if you do it quick enough it goes away less than 3 min|`|upwwspFIaa	Listen to me!!! There is a very effective way to eliminate cold sores. Its called Lysine. Its is an amino acid you can buy at any pharmacy. It has no side effects and works miracles when it comes to cold sores. There is a product called Airborne for avoiding the common cold which has Lysine in it so you could take that as well. When you feel that tingling you should take one pill twice a day 500mg. If you are past the tingling blister stage it will still shorten the time you have the cold sore better than any expensive cream or lip ointment. Herpecin-L works best if you don't want to take a pill. But trust me I haven't had any!! cold sores in a long time. Thank Lysine.
p0JydlOkaa	Okay, here's the deal.  Most of the time a baby tooth will fall out b/c the permanent one is growing behind it, but have you ever been hit in the mouth or had some kind of injury to the tooth that did fall out.  If so then it probably was not ready to come out and hence the reason it is taking so long for it to grow in.  I'm no professional mind you, but my niece had her front teeth knocked out when she was like 4 or 5 and she is now 8 and they still have not grown in due to the fact that they were knocked out and were not ready to come out.  She has been to the dentist and he said that they are there and you know so they will grow in soon.  Anyways, if you are really worried about it then ask your mom to make you a dental appointment and tell her that you are just concerned and you want to make sure that your teeth are growing correctly.|`|zYnArpdIaa	Nope that's not good.  As a kid you lose your teeth because the other teeth (the one that will stay) pushes away the teeth you lose... I think two months to long time before your other teeth is visible... but i'm not a dentist, ask your parents to visit a dentist|`|ZHOaSAljaa	sure you did not lose one of you permanent teeth? I i use to pull them out until my mother told they wasn't gonna grow back cus i pulled all my others. so now i just got adult teeth.  im glad some one told me before i pulled them all out so i get a dollar.lol|`|a4302ef3082a4c15bd3dc0512d93fe88aa	It is not unusual for it to take two months or more for a permanant tooth to replace the lost baby tooth.

hwiu7TCYaa	I'd rather have slow, long-lasting results. But If you enjoy softball, then by all means have fun doing that, there is nothing better then exercising and having fun at the same time, because then you usually don't think much about it.<br>  <br>  I rarely have fun when i exercise, but at least I'm usually  motivated.<br>  <br>  I would recommend you start slowly, if you got problems with your motivation. That way you steadily get in shape, without feeling "to exhausted" in the beginning. I often find the "exhausted feeling" to be motivating, but i know it had the opposite effect in the beginning.<br>  <br>  Interval training gives the quickest results, but may be to much on the motivation in the beginning, so start out by running smaller distances. Running generally gives quick results, especially if you have been in "good" shape before.<br>  <br>  <br>  I would also recommend you combine it with some weight training, you don't necessarily need to go to a training center. But it would be nice if you don't have any weight training equipment around your house, otherwhise you likely end up using various object, not really suited for the purpose. That may however be more fun then going to the training center.<br>  <br>  Fun aside, getting stronger really helps when getting in shape, many seem to neglect the effect of weight training, when trying to get "in shape", i combine all the exercises i consider relevant, to reach my own goals.<br>  <br>  Some times its quite obvious, if you think about it. For instance. Want to be a better/faster runner? Try to Combine it with weight training of stomach, legs, knees, back, and arms, as well as endurance training of same. And see how that works after some time.|`|TKNPveHDaa	The best thing you can do is go to the library or a book store and look at books on health and fitness.<br>  <br>  I would suggest a few easy things:  <br>  <br>  1. Start walking.  Walk 1-2 miles every night with your friends, your family or your pet.  As long as you're not on the couch all night watching tv, you're getting exercise.  Stay on your feet and keep moving.  That will go a long way.<br>  <br>  2.  Stop eating crappy foods.  Ask your mom to buy more fruits and veggies and less McDonalds.  That will help.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

cQc0bUiBaa	I wonder what your acid levels are like.  If you exercise, but don't eat enough vegetables, then you build up acid in your system which makes you ache.  Tofu is a good way to reduce acidity.  How often do you eat raw vegetables?  That is one possibility.  I think diet is always the first thing to look at.  Is your diet balanced, or do you eat a whole lot of just one thing, or one category of food, and need more balance?<br>  <br>  Another possibility is that you have been recently exposed to something you are allergic to, or have developed an allergy to to something that you have been over exposed to.  You might want to look into allergies.

rpnFxnCQaa	Simon,<br>  <br>  First, please do not say "no wife". There is someone for you, believe me. Believe in yourself too! <br>  <br>  I can relate to how you feel. I had anxiety attacks too. I was thinking too much. For me, that was when I had to speak in public. Or when there would be more than a few people around me in the same room. It was something that started when I was a teenager and that lasted over years and subsequently affected my career until not so long ago. <br>  <br>  At some point, I was prescribed medicine but I wanted to avoid that because of side effects. That's when I discovered a program that literally pulled me out of that "hole". It is a 100% natural method. <br>  <br>  The KEY is that you should no longer fear the thought of anxiety. You have to get out of that loop. Not only did that cure me - you become your true self again - but I was also extremely surprised to even discover newly built self-confidence.<br>  <br>  There is always a solution! Get out of the anxiety loop! And believe in a bright future that you too deserve.<br>  <br>  All the best,<br>  <br>  Misaki|`|c8828614b563cd3de41253b6a9e40991aa	I suffered from agoraphobia and panic attacks with depression for several years until it was discovered I have thyroid disease. When I got treatment for that, and a diet to help me balance my metabolism and lose the weight I gained with the thyroid disease, I found the depression lifted and the panic attacks disappeared. I am still dealing with the agoraphobia but it's much easier to handle than it was.<br>  <br>  I strongly suggest you get a full physical with bloodwork etc. to make sure there isn't an underlying organic element that's being ignored.|`|3CzCS11Saa	you need to keep on the doctor it takes time and they need pushing your showing positive signs by asking for help and wanting help also by talking about it well done i hope you get the help you need soon|`|eQCsKq4jaa	I know exactly what you are going through. I have panic disorder with Agoraphobia. Since you already take an SSRI and it helps you probably need a drug like Clonazepam. It is one of a few approved for panic. It works well and with the Citalopram it should vastly improve your anxiety. And what it comes down to is if your life is suffering substantially (as it sounds like it is) you need to take action. Clonazepam also works within hours. Alprazolam is also officially approved for panic. It works faster than Clonazepam.
6d7m0kWWaa	Don't say there's no hope.  I had (or perhaps have) your exact problem: I get panic attacks, hate crowds, have a hard time telling the difference between banter and bullying etc etc.  <br>  Then last year, almost on a whim, I decided to teach English for a year (I know, it was crazy).  Oddly enough, after the first few days of heart pounding fear I suddenly realized there was no problem, I could interact.  <br>  Since then I have decided that the difference is a pre-defined social script.  There's nothing to figure out between students and teachers.  They know how to behave, you know how to behave, everything is under control.  It has given me the opportunity to improve my social skills and interact with other people in a somewhat more acceptable fashion.  <br>  So, working from the assumption that part of your brain is overtaxed from trying to figure out what is going on in a social situation, I would advise you to try practicing in easier, more scripted social situations.  Re-train your brain so that you are more confident, less easily confused, and (if all else fails) have a better mask to hide behind while you work on issues. <br>  The most important thing in un-learning a fear re-wiring neural connections.  If you feel fear in social situations the two events become physically linked in your mind, so that when you are exposed to people direct wiring makes you experience fear (the phrase is "neurons that fire together wire together").  Work on weakening that wiring by concentrating on something else (anything you enjoy, as long as you don't leave the group).  Your fear has a physical structure, but your brain is capable of changing that structure.<br>  Basically, your genes shape you, but you have the power to shape your genes.  Don't give up, it's never hopeless.|`|wdmsXdHXaa	OH mate your in exactly the same position as me except i have a wife but that only makes it harder as there is more pressure here is my email address take it and contact me we will talk and hop fully we may be able to help each other who noes?... tang021@yahoo.co.uk

Ear pain and swelling along the area in front of and under the ear(s).  Mumps may occur only one side or both.|`|AA11549970	It could also be an ear infection - she needs to see the doctor
iNC2Yimlaa	Yes, very much. I would say that the most intense tickling I ever received was from a friend of mine. The two of us get together every once in a while for tickling sessions. Usually I just tickle her. She has incredibly ticklish feet also. However, every now and then I let her tickle me. On one such occasion she gave me a mind blowing foot tickling. We sat on the couch and she put my feet in her lap. Then she took off my socks and shoes. Next she pulled out a feather and tickled me senseless with it. She was able to use it with great skill (she did learn from the best after all lol). She took that feather and stroked every inch of my bare soles. Then she ran it all over my arches, up the sides of my feet and even under and between my toes. This went on for about thirty minutes or so. When she was finished she put down the feather and went to work with her fingernails. Her nails are devastating tickle tools. Their always well manicured and sharp. She started by lightly stroking the tops of my feet as a precursor of what was to come. After a few minutes of that she attacked my soles and arches with everything she had. She raked her nails up and down the bottoms of my feet leaving not a single spot untouched. I could barely stand it. She continued doing this for roughly another forty minutes, stopping on occasion to let me catch my breath. It was unbelievable. It was pure tickle torture. I loved it. When it was finally over I got her back good, but that's another story.|`|xhDdYnHTaa	My feet are very, very ticklish!  The worst foot tickling I can remember was one day when I was a kid.  I was playing on a fresh blacktop in my bare feet and when I got home the soles of my feet were pitch black.  My dad scrubbed my feet with a bath brush and soap until all the tar was off before letting me in the house. It took what seemed like an eternity and tickled sooooooo bad I thought I'd die!!  LOL!|`|GBODLQNcaa	yes,under my arms and on the bottom of my feet|`|mqxEw2daaa	My feet as extremely ticklish and for me just about every tickling experience is horrible. It always turns into painful prodding.

IyyAiFBmaa	Blood Type B: This blood group has the least dietary restrictions. You can eat most food groups including meat, dairy and vegetables. Avoid too many cereals like wheat (bread, sandwich, pizza, roti, sooji, etc.) Some dals (pulses) do well with this blood group like mung dal, channa dal, lobhia, rajmah etc. When it comes to exercise, Dr D’Adamo recommends activities that have mental component, such as hiking, tennis and swimming.

v0aMcZkDaa	It will help yes, I found that I could only jog for so long then I had to walk...try and jog until you can't anymore then walk and get your breath back then get back into a jog, keep doing that and you should improve and be able to jog longer|`|TKNPveHDaa	First, Skylar's wrong.  If you walk/jog/run/sprint/whatever the same distance, it's the same number of calories.  A mile takes the body about 100 calories to cover, no matter how hard you're working.  If you walk it in an hour or sprint it in four minutes, you burn 100 calories, more or less.  There's no difference in speed.<br>  <br>  Second, walking 5-6 km a day will burn an extra 250 calories per day.  In a week, you'll burn 2,000 extra calories.  In a month, that's 8,000 extra calories, or a little over a kg from just walking.  In six months, you can burn off 7-9 kgs from exercise.  Cut out some sweets and fatty foods and you're all set.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|jYSPZzXFaa	Du-uh!|`|X9QOHRLFaa	well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info. These guys even offer free fitness consultation to everyone, so if you want you can give them a call.<br>  <br>  www.xattack.in|`|ae4kktdqaa	YES|`|GllB4mPZaa	yes|`|GoepUF9gaa	yes it is true|`|IOVDAwmnaa	walking helps, but jogging helps a lot more. even if you only jog as far as you walk, you'll still lose more calories because you're working harder. so if you walk quickly for a mile, you'll burn some calories. but if you JOG a mile, you'll burn a lot more. get what i'm saying?|`|zV5pUKGYaa	Yes, it is because when you do exercise you burn calories and that reduces you weight. If you want to lose weight you can start eating green vegetables instead of McDonald's or some type of oily food.

ufgv7oTjaa	Truth be told, any answer given here will just be personal opinion (I can give you my opinion if you'd like). There are many higher quality companies out there that are readily available and well priced... just make sure the company has a good rating with either the GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) or USP (U.S. Pharmacopoeia), as those are the main quality assurance organizations (USP is for the U.S., GMP is for the U.S. and worldwide).<br>  <br>  Acai is a rather big fad product right now, so you have to be more careful of brands you haven't heard of and internet/E-mail ads because it would be so easy for any of those to be from a fly-by-night company. It would be easiest to get it from a well known brand (so you can verify their quality easier), but as long as you make sure the company has good quality requirements like the ones I mentioned above, they will all be similar quality and benefit so you can go for whichever one is the best price/offer for you. Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|AfnOU04paa	My local Vitamin Outlet carries it.  Also Vitamin World.  I don't know if these stores are national chains.

CciXZNYraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  ? Avoid those vending machines by carrying around your own healthful foods and leaving pocket change at home.<br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Clean your house! It is a great exercise idea if you work from home. Housework can burn off loads of calories. Start by vacuuming, polishing, dusting and cleaning glass/windows. Make your house sparkling clean while burning off excess weight.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|nah8tOF6aa	try online fatloss4idiots.com. I heard that it was a great weight loss program and that it really works. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|iTYVV3etaa	Hey, do you want to lose weight easily by doing nothing or get motivated to lose weight easily without even giving up half-way?<br>   <br>  The key and answer to successfully do it is in Your Subconscious Mind.<br>   <br>  The subconscious actually stores a multitude of memory patterns which will feed information to the conscious mind when activated. Data is never erased unless the subconscious mind gives that command.<br>  For example, when you walk or drive to your destination, you do it automatically without being aware of it - that is your subconscious mind doing the whole process without your conscious mind.<br>  The subconscious brain is very good at its job and works 24 hours a day on keeping us alive.<br>   <br>  The subconscious controls and regulates involuntary functions of the body such as breathing, circulation, Metabolism, Digestion, hormone balance, etc.<br>   <br>  So you may wonder.. how do you tweak or make your subconscious mind to lose weight easily?  The answer is... Hypnosis! <br>   <br>  Hypnosis is done by bypassing your conscious mind to your subconscious mind giving instructions and storing them successfully.<br>  That is why people can quit smoking, feel extremely motivated, attain success easily, study easily and so on Successfully just after 1 session of hypnosis! Even faith-healing uses Hypnosis!<br>   <br>  You will thank me because I can guarantee you Hypnosis Works!  You can just let your natural metabolism be high and Lose Fat Doing NOTHING effectively and immediately or be motivated to stop binge eating and exercise regularly without pain or laziness!<br>   <br>  A good hypnosis site for losing weight:<br>  <a href="http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk" rel="nofollow">http://www.BetterLivingWithHypnosis.tk</a>|`|kXq90b09aa	Hi <br>  <br>  Everyone has a daily calorie allowance, mostly it range from 1800-2900 calories a day. Go to the below mentioned link and find out your calorie allowance and eat less than that. whatever your calorie allowance is, eat 500 calories less a day, this way you will lose a pound a week (3500 calories = 1 pound). if you want to lose more, eat a lil bit less and exercise, however do not eat less than 1200 calories a day. Do cardio (30 mins jogging or 1 hour brisk walking at least 4 times a week, you will lose apprx 400 calories each session) <br>  <br>  Start weights once you lose few pounds, that will build and strengthen your muscles, the more muscles you have, higher your metabolic rate will be, thus you burn more calories. <br>  <br>  Start interval training after 1 or 2 months of cardio, which is a far better way to burn fat, but since this is high intense exercises, you have to be fitter than what you are now. <br>  <br>  to check your calorie allowance <br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/diet/calc-bmi-plus" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/diet/calc-bmi-plus</a>|`|AA11318212	eat healthy.<br>  jog, run, do exercises.<br>  take stairs instead of a lift/elevator or escalator.<br>  cut down on sugars, candy, go for non-fat.<br>  Surgery is the quick way out, but the weight will keep on piling back if you don't change your lifestyle.|`|jjHRaJ60aa	First you need a support group.

1EhbLBkUaa	If it hasn't sustained trauma from an injury, and you're able to move it, then I doubt that it's broken; normal use doesn't just suddenly break fingers, unless you have severe osteoporosis (brittle bones).  <br>  <br>  However, it could easily be injured in other ways, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or other repetitive use injury, or even arthritis.  The heavy use and pain when using it does suggest something more along those lines.  I would suggest seeing your doctor for a better diagnosis and treatment.  It is possible you might find a simple fix through just the use of proper typing posture and better hand and wrist support (such as wrist rests for your mouse and keyboard, and/or hand/wrist support devices to wear to hold your wrist in a better position), or you may need medication, physical therapy, or even surgery.|`|LKUjbuCuaa	Yes, check with a doctor.

JlVQWiP7aa	Hi!<br>  I thought it might be sleep apnea, so I went to The Kaiser website and found this:<br>  <br>  Sleep apnea occurs when you frequently stop breathing for 10 seconds or longer during sleep. It can be mild to severe, based on the number of times per hour that you stop breathing or have slowed breathing. Blocked or narrowed airways in your nose, mouth, or throat can cause sleep apnea. Your airway can become blocked when your throat muscles and tongue relax during sleep.<br>  <br>  What you're describing sounds just like what I experience sometimes.<br>  I dream that I'm underwater, and can't get to the surface to get air. Eventually, I wake up gasping for breath.<br>  Sorry, I couldn't find a real medical term for this. Anyway, I hope this helps :)|`|XXZFf1AYaa	Could be sleep apnea.

cWuumdy7aa	Consuming natural foods (fruits and some raw animal food), you will always absorb more than sufficient protein. Therefore, the body cannot even store protein.

Could be any number of things as you can see.|`|5IrunL2Xaa	Also might want to consider the gall bladder.  If you previously had kidney stones ask yourself if it was the same type of pain as before.  With a gall stone it will be located on the right, although at times it can lead to vomitting and overall stomach pains.  Believe me, it hurts.|`|xNBFsEnsaa	You probably are passing a kidney stone.

There's also a possibility of it being an ovarian cyst - hopefully just one of those harmless ones that clear up on their own.  In any case, I would make a list of your symptoms and dates, and pay a visit to the doctor.  Don't be scared....you'll be just fine. :)
0WySBPk9aa	i had a consultation and got an appointment in under 2 weeks, it really depends on many factors, how urgently they think you need the tooth removed and how quickly they can fit you in  for starters|`|MHg9JhEKaa	Probably about 3 months, but it depends on whether or not your op is classified as routine or urgent. Sounds fairly routine to me.|`|q4tTabfjaa	It is a post code lottery.<br>  Ask how much the private will cost.|`|JhIckFOXaa	Depends when they have appointment slots open. I got mine out 3 months after my consultation but they had open slots before that.

xktBgoKFaa	Ideal fasting blood sugar is between 70 and 99 mg/L at any age. Two hours after eating, it should not exceed 120. At no point in the day, should it exceed 140.|`|YL1NQ8ntaa	The basic levels are the same for everyone. What changes is your health level. The better your health the more you can use the basic levels as your goal. That is why a good annual physical is so important followed by a quick check every 90 days. Small improvements to better your health is the discipline to work for. Visit my blog site and print off the latest chart for glucose ranges. <br>  <br>  Best Wishes.|`|bzgo59anaa	well for a (FBS) fasting blood sugar <br>  a child <2 should be between 60-100 mg/dL<br>  a child >2 to adult should be <110 mg/dL<br>  elderly: increase in normal range after age 50 yrs.|`|cWuumdy7aa	Despite widely variable intervals between meals or the occasional consumption of meals with a substantial carbohydrate load, human blood glucose levels normally remain within a remarkably narrow range. In most humans this varies from about 80 mg/dl to perhaps 110 mg/dl (3.9 to 6.0 mmol/litre) except shortly after eating when the blood glucose level rises temporarily (up to maybe 140 mg/dl or a bit more in non-diabetics).<br>  <br>  It is usually a surprise to realize how little glucose is actually maintained in the blood and body fluids. The control mechanism works on very small quantities. In a healthy adult male of 75 kg (165.35 lb) with a blood volume of 5 litres (1.32 gal), a blood glucose level of 100 mg/dl or 5.5 mmol/l corresponds to about 5 g (0.2 oz or 0.002 gal, 1/500 of the total) of glucose in the blood and approximately 45 g (1? ounces) in the total body water (which obviously includes more than merely blood and will be usually about 60% of the total body weight in men). A more familiar comparison may help – 5 grams of glucose is about equivalent to a commercial sugar packet (as provided in many restaurants with coffee or tea).

No pills, supplements, creams, foods, exercises... nothing. (although gentle massage is very good for the skin and muscles there, just like everywhere *else* on your body)<br>  <br>  Just like every other part of your body, the shapes and sizes of your breasts throughout your life were decided the moment you were conceived - 9 months before you were born - so don't waste your time, energy or money worrying over them or trying to make them different.

Mine never affected any kind of function, I used to get teased about it in Junior High School shower. You can actually have multiple exit holes for the urethra as the curve develops.

The virus dies quite quickly once its away from the human bodies.  Is is not spread through fluids, nor electronic equipment.   <br>  <br>  If someone with an outbreak rubbed the cell phone charger against their open sores, and then you IMMEDIATELY took it from them and rubbed it against your genitals, you could perhaps catch herpes.<br>  <br>  No worries.|`|xxTyjZCkaa	Wow. Please educate yourself on STDs. I don't blame you because statistics say 1 in 5 people have herpes, I'm one of them, and it's scary. But it is smart to just educate yourself on the subject for your sake and others. Did you know that herpes could be spread without an outbreak? Did you also know that if someone has a cold sore on or in their mouth and they preform oral sex on you, you can contract genital herpes? There is so much information out there. Please use it! Good luck.

Are you ready to "accidentally" get pregnant and be a single mother, make your family VERY angry and troubled, force a boy to have to support your child for the next 18 years, lose out on carefree teen age and early adult years of social fun, and get one or more sexually transmitted diseases which could make you sterile for life or give you the HIV virus of eventually fatal  AIDS?

It sounds like you're a little uncomfortable about it, so stick with that. You're only 13 years old, and your friends may be doing that, but that doesn't mean you have to.<br>  <br>  Youth is lost on sex, and it's really hard for younger teens to keep from having sex because TV promotes it CONSTANTLY.<br>  <br>  But honestly, if I were you, I would hold out. I'm 22 and I honestly wish I was still a virgin.<br>  My best friend is 23 and she's a virgin because she feels that if she's going to have sex, it's going to be because she cares about someone and that person cares about her.<br>  <br>  Go with your instincts and your gut feeling.<br>  <br>  And I know you're going to hate this next answer, but talk to an adult, like maybe a parent. Because if you really think you're ready to have sex, you NEED birth control, because you don't want to end up a young teen and pregnant.|`|vl02PSpwaa	You made the right choice, spite sex isn't the right sex.

Very few 13 year olds really are.<br>  <br>  For some girls, it hurts a lot the first time... for others, only a little... for still others, it doesn't hurt at all. Same with bleeding... and there's no way to really know which it's going to be for you until it happens.<br>  <br>  You're ready for sex as soon as you want to do it *and* are comfortable and happy with the following... and if you're not comfortable with *all* of it - every word - then you're almost certainly not ready, no matter what age you are:<br>  <br>  First... really be *sure* you wanna "do it" with the guy you've chosen.<br>  <br>  You're a virgin, and your first full-on sex should be with someone you're really gonna want to *be* that intimate with for a while, and I don't just mean the physical intimacy of openly sharing your bodies and their reactions without shame... because there's a lot of mental and emotional stuff that comes with the hormones and hangups that fill the sexual territory between partners. You'll be MUCH better and happier for choosing such a person, even if that "while" only turns out to be a few weeks... trust me on this point, OK? <br>  <br>  First-timing can be pretty disappointing for girls, not just because it's often painful (at least at first), but also because nervousness and awkwardness for both of you can make it very difficult for *you* to concentrate on your own pleasure. You don't have to worry too much about *his* pleasure: except for some possible emotional stuff, he's going to enjoy it a *lot* - even his first time. Young men are lucky that way, sure, but it's also a very rare man indeed (but not at all a rare woman) who can have several orgasms in less than half an hour. :-)<br>  <br>  Advice? Tips? Good things to plan for and think about?<br>  <br>  Make sure you have lots of total privacy for quite a long time (three hours or more is a good idea) because not only might there be some uncomfortable, embarrassing or painful moments along the way, but there's more to the first time than just "doing it", and you'll have a lot of stuff to talk about afterwards - you do *not* want any of this to be interrupted.<br>  <br>  When it comes to intercourse, tell your guy that *you* will be the one to say "stop" if anything's wrong (like pain, or even if you just chicken out) and that it's up to him to remember that when you tell him "stop".<br>  <br>  If it should happen that your first time *will* be painful, bracing yourself against pain will only make it worse. RELAX... as he enters you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to pee - this will relax your pelvic muscles and *greatly* diminish any discomfort or pain.<br>  <br>  Don't even *try* unless you're very turned on and very slippery... a couple of orgasms first by masturbating/oral (*before* intercourse!) will also help your vagina to be more relaxed, stretchier and more insistent on having something inside - and if you don't get very wet no matter how horny you are, have some water-based lube (KY, Astroglide, Wet or similar) handy and no matter what, go SLOW until you're comfortable.<br>  <br>  That lube will also help prevent breakage of the condom. Yes, the condom. There's a name for people who rely on "pulling out" as a method of avoiding pregnancy: "parents"... or sometimes "parents with STDs".<br>  <br>  Any pain you may feel will go away in a few minutes to a couple of days (sometimes there's a little bruising), and after it's over with, each time will be *much* better if you stick to everything above.<br>  <br>  Oral sex is also fine any time at all for either person, at least if both of them are comfortable with it and enjoy it. Doing it until the person receiving has an orgasm is nicest, but that isn't necessary unless you both want it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  I'm a guy, and I'm almost 50 years old, but I would have benefited hugely from most of this advice myself the first time *I* had sex - at age 13. No regrets, but I know now that we both would have fared a lot better if we'd thought about these things even for a few days.<br>  <br>  Since then, I've raised 4 kids who've grown up to be fairly responsible and (more important) sexually healthy people. I'd *like* to think that their mothers and I were the ones who helped them to become that way.|`|qHa4w8eyaa	You were wise to say no.  You are definitely too young - your body is still growing and changing, and you don't want to do any permanent damage.  Why risk a pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease that can change your life when it has barely even begun?  You see the glamour of sex, but not the consequences.  You've probably never heard of the painful blisters that some people get on their private parts, or the little lice-like bugs that can hibernate there, or the infections - and these are just some of the minor consequences!<br>  <br>  Respect your body and soul - Wait until you are married.  If only one guy is THE ONE, then the others won't matter in the end....so why share yourself with them now?  I hope you continue to make wise decisions. :)

P3e2kJtwaa	The patient load has increased dramatically on my floor (mother baby).  But in our case it's not actually a nursing shortage, it's the fact that our manager overhired this past summer, and we have a ton of nurses (to make up for the increase in patient flow).  Unfortunately, with the economy, we were overbudget, and several of our staff were cancelled (told not to come in) once a week for a little over a month (24 hours missing from each paycheck hurts around Christmas time).The pediatric and vent units have both been closed for a while (no patients at the moment).  The vent unit has been closed since before Christmas.<br>  <br>  Fortunately (kinda), there are a lot more patients on our floor right now, so we're not being cancelled as often, but it's very stressful for us (and sometimes our patient satisfaction decreases because we are SOOO distracted).  It's very hard to give our patients the best care possible when we have 6 or more couplets (meaning 6 babies AND 6 mommies) each.<br>  It also increases our chances of making fatal errors (like wrong medication to the wrong pt, or med given at the wrong time, or baby taken to the wrong mommy), so we're made to be even more cautious- that's a huge stressor.

Things that help with this include painkillers, particularly anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen or diclofenac, keeping mobile but not staying on your feet for long periods of time, and physiotherapy.

6YnwXCIaaa	You might not need a doctor, but you at least need someone else's help (your mom?) to get this figured out.  This is just because you can't see the back of your earlobe.  That person will be able to tell you if it's just crusted on, in which case you would use a hot washcloth to dissolve the crust, or if it's grown into the skin, in which case they might need to use a little more force or even see a doctor.|`|uVmwUqhIaa	This should not be occurring. As of right now, lubricate your piercing with Bactine, a sea salt soak, or whatever you may have. Pull down on your lobe with both thumbs so that the piercing widens. Have your mother use a pair of tweezers to remove the back of the earring. Clean your piercing well for the next two weeks. All of this irritation can cause an infection. <br>  <br>  What type of backings are you using? If using a butterfly back [which are used mostly for stud earrings], it should not be getting stuck in the piercing. It is entirely too large. If this is the type that is getting stuck, make sure to space the backing away from your earlobe.<br>  <br>  If you are using hookups [which are used for wire hook earrings], which I assume you are, switch to butterfly backings. This will keep you from getting them stuck in yours ears again.<br>  <br>  Unless you are wearing a stud earring, backs should not be touching the ear. If you are wearing studs, make sure to use a butterfly backing.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|EkPRq4JPaa	Go to Claires, or where ever you got them pierced, and see the person that pierces. They'll tell you what you need to do.|`|46K4FtE0aa	First you are not supposed to keep taking them in and out when they are first done, when you thought it was stuck in the hole, it was probably just stuck with dried matter or blood, you are just supposed to turn them regularly and clean them with surgical spirit, which is available from any chemist. So get some surgical spirit and some cotton wool and clean the back thoroughly, without removing the earring, keep turning and cleaning it until the earring moves freely, do this 4-6 times a day, especially in the morning and before you go to bed. If it is no better in a day or 2 or if it starts to get sore, you will have to see a doctor for advice or a piercing professional.

CHiEKZrLaa	Absolutely!    Strep throat is a Streptococcal (bacterial) infection of the mucosa of the throat.    Removing the tonsils/adenoids will not prevent strep throat from developing if you're exposed to the bacteria (contagious by drinking from someone's glass, etc.)  It will just prevent "tonsilitis" developing as a result of the infection - ie: no swollen tonsils to contend with.    Some people fight off a strep throat infection with no problems, but others have difficulty resolving the infection.  If the strep lasts more than a few days, it's best to consult a doc.  If left untreated, strep throat can disseminate into the blood (rheumatic fever) and can cause damage to the heart.|`|AA11599407	Absolutely, strep is an infection of the throat and is not limited to the tonsils.

oSEJ50yUaa	Norvasc, amlodipine besylate, helps control high blood pressure. And it can be used to treat the chest pain of angina. Norvasc works to relax your blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily through them. The end result is lower blood pressure and less angina.    It has been shown to work for many types of patients. It even works for patients with mild, moderate, or severe levels of high blood pressure.
YIW1KIi6aa	1. Flax (also known as common flax or linseed) (binomial name: Linum usitatissimum) is a member of the genus Linum in the family Linaceae. It is native to the region extending from the eastern Mediterranean to India and was probably first domesticated in the Fertile Crescent. This is called as Jawas/Javas or Alashi in Marathi.[1] Flax was extensively cultivated in ancient Egypt. (New Zealand flax is not related to flax, but was named after it as both plants are used to produce fibres.)    Flax is an erect annual plant growing to 1.2 m tall, with slender stems. The leaves are glaucous green, slender lanceolate, 2040 mm long and 3 mm broad. The flowers are pure pale blue, 1525 mm diameter, with five petals; they can also be bright red. The fruit is a round, dry capsule 59 mm diameter, containing several glossy brown seeds shaped like an apple pip, 47 mm long.    2. its benefits    Possible medical benefits    Flax seeds contain high levels of lignans and Omega-3 fatty acids. Lignans may benefit the heart, possess anti-cancer properties and studies performed on mice found reduced growth in specific types of tumors. Initial studies suggest that flaxseed taken in the diet may benefit individuals with certain types of breast and prostate cancers. Flax may also lessen the severity of diabetes by stabilizing blood-sugar levels. There is some support for the use of flax seed as a laxative due to its dietary fiber content though excessive consumption without liquid can result in intestinal blockage. Consuming large amounts of flax seed can impair the effectiveness of certain oral medications, due to its fiber content.    3. best they can be used    Uses    Flax is grown both for its seeds and for its fibers. Various parts of the plant have been used to make fabric, dye, paper, medicines, fishing nets and soap. It is also grown as an ornamental plant in gardens.

Source: USDA Nutrient database    Flax seeds come in two basic varieties, brown and yellow or golden, with most types having similar nutritional values and equal amounts of short-chain omega-3 fatty acids. The exception is a type of yellow flax called Linola or solin, which has a completely different oil profile and is very low in omega-3. Although brown flax can be consumed as readily as yellow, and has been for thousands of years, it is better known as an ingredient in paints, fiber and cattle feed. Flax seeds produce a vegetable oil known as flaxseed or linseed oil; it is one of the oldest commercial oils and solvent-processed flax seed oil has been used for centuries as a drying oil in painting and varnishing.    One hundred grams of ground flax seed supplies about 450 kilo-calories, 41 grams of fat, 28 grams of fiber, and 20 grams of protein.    One tablespoon of ground flax seeds and three tablespoons of water may serve as a replacement for one egg in baking by binding the other ingredients together. Ground flax seeds can also be mixed in with oatmeal, yogurt, water (similar to Metamucil), or any other food item where a nutty flavour is appropriate. Flax seed sprouts are edible, with a slightly spicy flavour. Excessive consumption of flax seeds can cause diarrhea.    Flax seeds are chemically stable while whole, and milled flaxseed can be stored at least 4 months at room temperature with minimal or no changes in taste, smell, or chemical markers of rancidity. Ground flaxseed can go rancid at room temperature in as little as one week.Refrigeration and storage in sealed containers will keep ground flax from becoming rancid for even longer|`|a48b8f799e030a044da781ffac6f94cdaa	Also known as Linseeds.

Yeast is a fungus that normally lives in the vagina in small numbers. A vaginal yeast infection means that too many yeast cells are growing in the vagina. These infections are very common. Although they can bother you a lot, they are not usually serious. And treatment is simple.    What causes a vaginal yeast infection?  Most yeast infections are caused by a type of yeast called Candida albicans.    A healthy vagina has many bacteria and a small number of yeast cells. The most common bacteria, Lactobacillus acidophilus, help keep other organisms-like the yeast-under control.     When something happens to change the balance of these organisms, yeast can grow too much and cause symptoms. Taking antibiotics sometimes causes this imbalance. The high estrogen levels caused by pregnancy or hormone replacement therapy can also cause it. So can certain health problems, like diabetes or HIV infection.    What are the symptoms?  A yeast infection causes itching or soreness in the vagina and sometimes causes pain or burning when you urinate or have sex. Some women also have a thick, clumpy, white discharge that has no odor and looks a little like cottage cheese.    These symptoms are more likely to occur during the week before your menstrual period.    How is a vaginal yeast infection diagnosed?  Its easy to guess wrong about a vaginal infection. See your doctor if you aren't sure what you have or if this is the first time you have had these symptoms. Also see your doctor if you are pregnant. Your doctor may want to do a vaginal exam.     How is it treated?  If you have had a yeast infection before and can recognize the symptoms, and you aren't pregnant, you can treat yourself at home with medicines you can buy without a prescription. You can use an antifungal cream, or a suppository that you put into your vagina, or antifungal tablets that you swallow.    If your symptoms are mild, you may want to wait to see if they clear up on their own.    Yeast infections are common during pregnancy. If you are pregnant, don't use medicine for a yeast infection without talking to your doctor first.    If you use a cream or suppository to treat the infection, don't depend on a condom or diaphragm for birth control. The oil in some medicines weakens latex, the material often used to make these devices.    Many women have infections that come back. If you have more than four yeast infections in a year, see your doctor. He or she may do some tests to see if your yeast infections are being caused by another health problem, such as diabetes.    Can vaginal yeast infections be prevented?  You can prevent yeast infections by making sure that your genital area stays as dry as possible and can "breathe." For example:    Wear cotton, not nylon, underwear, and avoid tight-fitting pants and panty hose.   Change out of a wet swimsuit right away.   Avoid douches and feminine sprays, scented toilet paper, and deodorant tampons.|`|pGsuxYfuaa	I would ask your doctor all of this.. he/she would know a lot better.|`|u3gyFKzzaa	don't listen to these people sweet heart....I'm a straight girl...but I respect gays and lesbians....

Does she have a family who you could talk to and ask if theres anything she might like doing?|`|kA0xb0MVaa	Crafts are always big.  My cousin is moderately retarded.  She functions at about 13 or 14 even though she is 30 years old.  She comes to visit every summer, and we do craft projects, make cookies, and go to craft stores to get ideas of stuff we want to do on her next visit. She takes all the stuff home that we make and sells it at a "yard sale" at the community center she is a member of.  At this center she learns life skills, how to cook, balance a checkbook, order food at a restaurant, part-time job skills (which she won't be able to use) and make-up tips (her favorite part).  She calls me often to tell me all that she is learned and asks me what I think.      I just ask her, she usually will tell me just exactly what she wants, the problem only comes when I want to do something different. But if you know the age she is functioning on then I can give you some more ideas.    You need to do some networking in your area, to help find her some other people her age dealing with the same issues.

d68e44306ccdb303c6ffb9339eea647eaa	It's a sticky situation. If you pipe up about having ADHD usually insurance companies will turn coverage down as pre existing medical condition.     That said if it hasn't been documented and no doctor has confirmed that wait until AFTER you are insured. That way they can't pass the buck so to speak.    The one answer above is a jerk. ADHD is very real in some people.|`|YlLdIPRvaa	Yes, they will probably ask about pre-existing conditions and mental health.  I have not heard of an insurance company denying benefits due to ADHD.  It is something that is very treatable.  It's not like a life threatening disease that will cost the insurance company tons of money.  Good luck.|`|AA12004844	yes, you can still get insurance, but do not tell them that you suspect you have adhd.  They CAN decline your insurance if you have a condition and know about it before hand|`|AJetKsTmaa	Yes that's a stupid answer. They won't are om my god it's not really a mental disorder. They would only care if you have a big list of medical problems or have been in the hospital a lot. For AD HD to help it calm down and shut up and you can control it.

You can do things one of two ways, you can go through treatment thinking that you are going to beat it, or you can give up before even starting.|`|LQABiZcaaa	HOPE has a very powerful physiological effect on the human body and there is some evidence that it has some impact on the success or treatment and healing.|`|FicyC2TXaa	Absolutely not.    There is no scientific evidence to suggest that any emotion, feeling, or state of mind - positive or negative  - plays any part in surviving cancer. There is, though,  evidence to the contrary    This link is about a Dutch study of 9700 women. The study found that the dvelopment of breast cancer had no link with personality..no link with anxiety, anger, depression, stress, or optimism.     This research is a prospective study; that is, at the start of the study no one had breast cancer. The women were followed for 13 years. Many studies of stress are retrospective, asking people after they have breast cancer if they had been stressed - obviously far less reliable    http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/a...    This next link is to a report in the British Medical Journal which explodes the theory that a 'fighting spirit' is associated with longer survival from cancer or that 'hopelessness and helplessness' means poorer outcomes. The researchers analysed existing studies from1979 onwards; their conclusion is:     'There is little consistent evidence that psychological coping styles play an important part in survival from or recurrence of cancer. People with cancer should not feel pressured into adopting particular coping styles to improve survival or reduce the risk of recurrence.'     -pretty much exploding the myth that a 'positive attitude' can affect the course of or chances of survival from cancer.    http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/325/...    I was diagnosed with an advanced aggressive cancer; I suffered badly from depression during treatment, and remained gloomy about my chances of surviving. Five years later I am well with no evidence of cancer at my last (and final) check up.    Personally I found people urging me to stay or be positive made me feel worse - I felt guilty and so  became more depressed because I just couldn't be as positive as they were telling me it was necessary to be.|`|Cbom3Lweaa	If you are optimistic it always helps a strong mind and a strong will always go along way. Some people argue that the world we live in is an illusion and that the only part of humans that really exists is the mind and soul so there's nothing wrong in believing that you can beat it!!

WXpdkbG8aa	A LOT of girls are worried about all of the above, just like you! It's normal to feel that way. If he has already gone down on you and keeps begging, he must like it, right?! Every vagina smell, look and feel is different. Guys love them just because of what they are and don't worry too much, like girls do. They're so aroused and caught up in the moment that they don't think about the little things. As long as you keep it clean, you're fine. :) Relax and enjoy it. When you can get over the paranoia in your mind, you will LOVE him going down on you and YOU will be the one begging for more. ;) Good luck!!|`|U0KCmsKXaa	I am the same way.  It doesn't matter how clean I am, it always makes me extremely self-conscious -- unless of course he's really, well, talented at what he can do down there.  If that's the case then after a while I forget all of that and really get into it.  If he keeps wanting to do it, then you should take it as a compliment that he enjoys giving you pleasure and likes the way you taste and smell.  Some guys LOVE this.  Count yourself lucky since most men would rather you go down on them and have absolutely no interest in pleasuring their woman.  As long as you are clean, just try to relax and enjoy it.|`|qSnF1jseaa	your selfconcious because your not comfortable in your relationship yet.|`|O8XjkCjxaa	It's natural to feel self-conscious, everyone finds it difficult to let someone put their face there, but you'll get more used to it the more he does it.    Just don't do it when you're not ready, you have to feel confident about yourself or you won't enjoy it.    If you showered before, it will be fine. Just relax and enjoy :)|`|55MkioABaa	you would know if it smelt horrible because he wouldnt want to ever do it again. if he wants to do it again he must have enjoyed it.    everyone has a smell down below, it doesnt ever smell of nothing. if it smells fishy or yeasty then thats a sign of an infection like thrush or BV.    just make sure u wash with lots of warm water and soap which has no perfume or colouring in it (simple is a good brand)|`|c1Dpi0eyaa	Since I'm 50 I don't think it is appropriate for me to answer this question unless you are at least 35, and then you would know the allure of the forbidden blossom to a man seeking the essence of a woman em-passioned.|`|Ws1qOP1Haa	Its just about being comfortable to ask.Its normal to be insecure about intimacy at first.

If you weren't he wouldn't insist on doing it again. Good Luck|`|wnDwgKWLaa	ewwwwwwww pussy?    i loves me a fat dick|`|0gFdt7VUaa	All women are thinking the same way you are. So don't think its just you. We as women are taught to keep ourselves clean and smelling good. In your mind you are thinking " but he is so close to my private area. Maybe he can smell something I cant".  Men who like to do that, WILL NOT do it if it smells badly! So the fact that he wants to go back a second time tells you that your hygiene is fine.If he backs away and doesn't want to do it any more THEN you know something is wrong...lol....Every woman has her own unique smell....smell not odor...and men who like to give oral sex are attracted to that smell. There is nothing wrong with being self conscious but don't ruin a moment being too self conscious.|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Although, even if you think it smells bad, and you smell it and it smells bad, them guys LIKE that whiff.

That's your best bet.|`|FtBHXQvHaa	go see a dermatologist|`|MpVQE8tnaa	Yes you can use ice to numb the itch---I do that.    Also try some hydrocortisone cream|`|wVqIIXOjaa	Don't put ice on it! I feel the same burning/itching when it flares up. I just put some anti-itch cream and keep going about with my day.|`|PmjeWyn2aa	I have had excema my entire life. I am 30 years old now. The bumps will go away if you can avoid scratching them. My doctor gave me a cream called triamcinolone 0.1% (generic for Kenalog). I apply it to any itchy spots, and it will relieve them. It also helps to heal the wounds if you scratched it. Other things that work are:  Emu oil. Worked for me, but not always easy to find.  Benedryl. Even though you swallow it, it does help the itching and flare up. Benedryl will also help prevent outbreaks. It does cause drowsiness though.  good luck

oWP2DjJoaa	If that's you in the pic.     You don't need to lose weight. You're perfectly fine. TRUST ME.       But you can loose weight by eating healthy and exercising.     Getting yourself to starve will make everything worse. Cuz when you starve your muscles will go and that's when you see the ppl that look like they are skin and bones. And when you start eating again. You get way bigger than you originally were. cuz your body is trying to store as much food as possible right after going out of starvation mode.   And what does that food end up as     Fat.     Hope that helps.     But you don't need to lose weight if that's you in the pic.

When I lost mine though I used the help of hoodia. I know it's going to sound line a line of bull but I seriously did lose 33 pounds using desert burn hoodia. If you want me to prove it, look at my pic here on my profile and then GOOGLE: online health desert burn hoodia :and you'll see that my picture on my web site after i lost my weight is the same pic here on my profile. I swear to God hoodia worked for me and fast. I got fat when I hurt my back and couldn't do much in the way of exercise. When I first started taking it i literally the first day forgot to eat. Hoodia totally took my appetite away and for me that's a minor miracle because I'm always hungry it seems. True, I sell the stuff on my wellness site and if after reading my info. you want to try some I would very much appreciate it if you got yours from me but if not just get some in general and whatever you do, PLEASE don't get any of that crap they sell at GNC or those places. They aren't 100% hoodia so they work like crap. So, do that google like I suggested and click my link and see for yourself. It will help you lose your 14 pounds quick. Also, sorry about your grandma dear. I lost mine last year. She was 92 and made it a long way but I still miss her pretty bad. Take care and God Bless you and your family.

Eat a bunch of veggies, and fruit, limit breads, and 'white' foods,   drink 1/2 your body weight in ounces of water every day...  walk, or exercise at least thiry minutes every day  eat a variety of healthy fun foods, that dont have a bunch of processed ingrediants, and mix  it up in small amounts during the day  eat smaller amounts of food at each meal  stop eating at least three hours before bed time  study traditional chinese medicine and nutrition  Certain teas help also, but should not be consumed all day, only a few cups in AM...  ask an experienced health provider

yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.     The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.     And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.|`|CpXgvDz7aa	Go to Jamba Juice and order an acai smoothy!|`|0mb87orbaa	There are plenty of web sites offering free trials on Acai berry Maxx  and the like.

Im not sure if they have it but they do have many dieting supplements. If you go to their web site www.gnc.com you can find a store near you, using their store locator link. I don't work for gnc by the way lol. I don't really recommend buying acai berry supplements online. I tried this and they wanted me to try it free. (plus the stupid 4.95 for shipping and handling and of course they'll send you one every month and charge you for it) You can avoid this mistake I made buy buying from a website that doesn't have this offer.

6sjphNcPaa	not for me! diet pills only make your wallet lighter.  Even when I cut back on my eating, I saw no difference.    Portion control is very important. I started on Nutrisystem a month ago and have lost 6 pounds! The portions are small but I'm not hungry during the day. The food is pretty good and really easy to fix (nothing requires being refrigerated).    Good luck (email me if you want to "talk")|`|qSnF1jseaa	ive taken hydroxycut for a while, they give you energy, but dont make you skinnier, its not worth the price|`|u95CsOUHaa	The active ingredient in Hydroxycut is caffeine.  There is no magic in the pill.  The caffeine gives you a boost so you exercise longer because you have the energy to do so.  If you are going to go that route, just drink a cup of coffee from Starbucks.    But on a healthy note, if you want to lose weight healthfully and quickly,     cut out sugar  cut out all white flour products  eat lots of fruit and vegetables  eat lean proteins    I guarantee you will lose weight fast and still be healthy.|`|rgaX3I56aa	Screw hydroxycut!!! Not really. It might be good just that i don't know much about it. What I do know is that I used desert burn hoodia and lost 33 pounds and have kept it off for over 3 years now. I had back surgery in 04 and put on some weight because I was laying on my back recovering for a while. My buddy mark is practically a personal trainer although not certified or anything, just that he;s really up on all the latest fitness and nutrition supplements and stuff. Anyhow, I asked him what to do and he told me he heard good things about hoodia. I did some research and found out the desert burn was one of the best. I got some and took it on the first day and literally forgot to eat. My appetite is very strong I might ad so when i forget to eat it's kind of a minor miracle. So I took it for a couple of months and my will power was very high and I dropped 33 pounds in just a couple of months and it didn't even seem like I was dieting. I was so psyched about feeling better and losing the weight that I started my own website dedicated to back health, diet tips and all around wellness. You asked, I'm telling you. try hoodia. It worked like a charm for me. If you want, cut and paste: online health desert burn hoodia :into your GOOGLE search and you can read all about how I did it complete with before and after pics (the same pic on my profile I might ad) and just tons of good diet and nutrition advice from a guy that lived it and still does. Best of luck and take care my friend. You just need a little help. Hoodia will help. Cole F.

Normally, drinking 8-12 8oz glasses of water a day is sufficient. However, if you exercise, you should drink at least 64oz.  When you drink enough water, your pee should be very very light yellow, almost clear.     Warning: You don't want to drink too much water, as you will lose electrolytes, necessary chemicals that keep your fluids balanced.|`|haAtwu3iaa	At least 8 cups, but I drink about 10 cups a day.  Your pee should actually be the "color" of water, so I've been told.|`|AA10921399	well every body says 8 glasses of water but even if u drink 5 its still good , u could drink a gallon but u proballu force ur self so every times you eat drink water 20 minutes b4 u eat n then after, n that will also help u so u dont eat alot.. ur pee should b bright yellow .if its really dark yellow u have to tal 2 ur doctor

For a quick try you may try peroxide, it is a cheap ingredient in many over the counter products and the main active ingredient in some very popular remedies...  There is no 'fast' remedy that I know of, depending on what you mean by fast...  A dermatlogist can tell you part of the cause in your case, and offer certain help....some of the over the counter stuff may help, and cover at the same time... you have to find what works for you...  Or an alternative herbalist can actually heal it for you if you find a licensed practioner that knows what they are doing...search acne herbal remedies or acne traditional chinese medicine  You will eventually out grow this, as your hormones balance out, and sometimes hormones are the sole cause of acne..... but it is usually a combination....  Be careful  of not dryingout your face skin, as this could just make it worse....   I think I would try that product, I forget the name of it, sorry, it has peroxide as a main ingredient... I think PDIDDY uses it, and others...  Home remedies, look on the internet....   oh, you might try apple cider vinegar externally , also... it kills bacteria, the same as peroxide... but you still need to be sure not to dry out your skin too much....   ask an herbalist...  the chinese medicine has remedies for this, that heal, where as western medicine just treats....     This too will pass.... to deal with your feelings go to www.emofree.com and learn the easy to learn technique given free there and use it on all your feelings and everything.... this will help too.... and you can have it to use on anything for the rest of your life, to pass on to others, too.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	If you have an oily skin wash your face twice a day in warm salty water.

This isnt just my say so its almost word for word from my doctor. sorry but theres no such thing as a home remedy.|`|MqiynUcPaa	Hmm...the best home remedies i've heard of are toothpaste and honey.

61e4345eeb923941a198de0f22203ae9aa	Who you are, is who you are right now in the present.    In the proverbial search for the true nature of our self we embark on an illusionary journey with several way points.    We start at A. - the point in time at which we decide to seek out ourselves.    B - Is the duration of that search.    And finally C - the point at which we reach a level of satisfaction with the person we have become; successfully concluding through our own interpretation of our achievements, that we are better, we are smarter, that we are more experienced and advanced in every way COMPARED to point A.    In order to determine the value of something, be it, character, personality, price, achievement, substance. We must be able to "compare" it to either the same thing in a time in the past, or a similar thing in the present which is considered of better or worse quality, a model to aspire towards.    What all this means to your question is that. Finding out who you are, is not a singular place or time. It is a continuous process, the sum of which is the result of your desire to find out who you are.    Therefore. You need to understand that, you are now, as you are, finding out who you are. And tomorrow will be a part of that process, as will the day after that and those further on in the future to come.    Once you can understand this. You will see that, finding out who you are really means, learning to live and let time pass, because it is only then that the experiences of life and the catalysts of your self discovery will slowly fuse together over time and become stronger and more visible.    So who you are will not be a point in your life that you will come to know, because the definition of you will constantly be in evolution, always changing, always growing. And until the day of your last breath, you will never sit still enough to be able to calmly observe the mature nature of your accomplishment in life, the raw and final form of yourself. The last phase of your development. The who and what of you.    So live... live on... and time will embrace the current you and carry you with its change until you have no more days left to grow and time sets you down as she continues on her infinite journey.    That day, you will know who you are - through the life you have lived.     So live... and worry not about it.    Good luck.|`|DT39BIL1aa	You may need to see someone about it, it's not cheap but I am presuming it will help you out, same here, maybe you need to start practicing at home being comfortable with yourself, talking to the mirror maybe.

Dhz4XgQ3aa	hey honey,    You sound really upset and down, i hope i can help you a little...    first of all your hormones are all over the place and this will make you more insecure then you would be normally.     I understand how you feel, my ex used to work away and i knew that he was a bit of a ladies man before we were together so i was incredibly insecure. I used to have bad anxiety attacks when he was away.     Try reading Overcoming Jealousy by Windy Dryden. It really helps to put things in perspective and teach and train you to change your beliefs about reasons to be jealous. It helped me. It will help you try to see that him looking is not a big deal. Honestly the book will really help your insecurities. You can get it on amazon and you can prob even get a second hand copy at a cheap price!    I had hypnotherapy as well for my insecurities and jealousy issues.  It isnt what people think and it just feels like you really relaxed, and you are totally aware of whats going on.     He might be just trying to be one of the lads. Guys do that.     I dont think he would get the chance to unfaithful where his.    As for doing sexual things on camera, I wouldnt do that if your not comfortable. You wouldnt want any of his army friends to see a that video. Send him some nice sexy shots of you in some nice lingerie, you can still be sexy and pregnant!!! Or take a photo on your phone of your cleavage and send it to his phone. you can flirt with him like that whilst he is over there.     I hope your not too alone. Do you have some friends that can keep you busy while he is away? go to the cinema etc?     Lots of love honey xxx|`|Znzx92mEaa	First take a deep breathe and relax. The stress of this situation is not good for you or your baby. All guys like sex, that's a fact that can't be ignored. As far as you posing on the internet for him you were right to say no. Maybe a couple of your own pictures mailed to him might help him. Nothing too naughty though, maybe some teddies or something like that.|`|d34NoSGhaa	Don't do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. If he makes you feel guilty, tough.   I understand how you feel. You don't know what he will do.  You told him how you felt and now all you can do is drop it.  A guy can't stand it if you are all needy and pushy. Constantly insecure and bringing up the same thing over and over again.  You just might push him in the wrong direction just to get away from you.  He's a dude, he's going to look.  If he says he loves you, then you're just going to have to believe him.  Baby or not, you HAVE only been together for a little while. If you are like this now, you are not going to have a future. He will leave.|`|EZt7ZHIiaa	Hi there, I counsel people in relationship problems on a regular basis, and trust is one of the primary issues that come up.  I personally don't get the feeling that him looking at this other woman is a big deal or in any way a reflection on how he feels about your relationship.  If it is of any consolation, I don't think you have anything to worry about, at least not with this incident.  The thing is, people are always going to be attracted to attractive people, or curious as to what other people look like, and eyes wander, but that doesn't mean the heart goes along with it.  Your husband sounds like he is very much in love with you and committed to you, so I wouldn't read too far into this one.  If he is constantly gawking at other women, then you may think about being a little more concerned.     The thing you may want to be concerned with is your inability to trust him.

5zQbG8TDaa	They would need to weigh about 600 to 700 pounds. Need to keep active and exercise. Need a big bed and big doorways to get through.
bpEv0B6Naa	It all varies on how the leg actually broke, and the health of the person and his ability for his bones to heal.     Generally, a broken leg will take about 1 to 2 months to completly heal, then again varying on the health of the person.|`|VSIVgnG0aa	Magnet therapy will heal bones MUCH faster.  The last time I broke my tibia I permanently attached some Nikken magnets and it healed at least 3x as fast as normal.  Try to borrow some from somebody because they can be very expensive.
yAvTxh47aa	Assuming an RA titer works like a proof-of-immunization titer (and it probably does) the higher titer means more antibodies per uL (or whatever unit), which means the body is attacking the joints WORSE...    So, if you're treating with immunosuppressants, you're going to decrease the number of antibodies, but if you're treating with other things, then you're not.    This is based on experience with *other* ai diseases, though. (I've got Ord's, myself, and my antibody titer is very high and I'm asymptomatic due to good drugs...)
zZ55CRulaa	i hate to tell you this, but it will be very hard the first time you bench press. I don't know your exact body makeup so i cant tell you how hard it will be for you to bench 80 lbs.  I struggled badly the very first time i bench pressed. So don't worry about. Im sure other people will struggle too.  There are also a few tricks you can try to increase your bench:    Follow this link to find so helpful hints: http://www.teenbodybuilding.com/anthony1...|`|5kXxr6r0aa	benching your body weight is considered the cut-off point where people won't laugh at you for having a bad bench, cruel, but a true trend i've found.    you should never just jump in and try to bench your own weight, its dangerous needless to say, and also rare.    to get a sense for how strong you are, start doing reps with the bar (olympic standard = 45 lbs.). Do this just to get an idea of how strong you are.    if you're afraid of the bench press, which isn't uncommon i'm being totally serious with that, start doing alternative chest workouts, and i'd suggest a LOT of pushups.    good luck with your goal man|`|u95CsOUHaa	Hi.  You will be fine.  The purpose of this "test" is to see what level of fitness you are.  The teacher needs to know where everyone stands so that they can give you appropriate exercises.  I don't know how hard it will be for you to bench press 80 pounds but I do know this:  Do what you can, and if that means you can only do 1 bench press - you've done great and the teacher will understand.    They are not expecting you to be Hercules.  Good Luck.|`|wOytdKEQaa	I'm assuming this is the beginning of the year test. Typically, you are given fitness tests before you start classes, and then are given the same tests at the end of the year to show your teacher your improvement. That means you don't have to be a superstar on your first test. You just have to try your best. You'll get in shape, don't worry! :)    When bench pressing, you are given a partner. Just be sure to warn your partner if you're in over your head so that they can help you out. If you can barely hold it up anymore, tell your partner so they can get you out of the situation.    Good luck!
Z1qoQjsZaa	I have a condition that prevents me from sleeping more than 45 Min's to an hour per day. I used to take melatonin to help me, but it caused me to be very drowsy the next day(especially if it was mixed with any caffeine product). Try cutting the melatonin back to 1/2 a pill a nite, and see if this helps.|`|GlP7KECoaa	is it because your thinking about something? try to clear your head, tense up all your muscles, then from your toes up relax them completely. put your hand on your stomach and take long deep breaths, counting 1,2,3 for each and focusing your hand going up and down on your stomach. hopefully that helps!
sZbyEohxaa	4-6 hours depending on how much medication you have had
lvBUl3Zdaa	No, I have trouble sleeping any more than I need. And even if I want to, the cats will try their darnedest to keep me from sleeping in. )|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	no, because all i have is nightmares. D:|`|1oBilGHuaa	When I am feeling more depressed I do sleep longer to pass the day away.  If I don't have any plans for too many days in a row, I will want to sleep late.  I know it is very important to keep myself busy.  Best Wishes to you.|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	No but Im pretty sure that is a form of depression.|`|By1DJAUOaa	i do...and i am depressed|`|ONWCXzUMaa	I hate sleep, i would stay up 24/7 it i could i don't like to miss anything in life since I only do this once.  take care  dave|`|6SgChhyLaa	yeah i do all the time  when i dream it is as if reality doesn't exist, and i live in my own perfect Utopian society, only until i wake up.    I love sleep, because of that reason. as an escape from reality|`|GVf1Ho7haa	yeah thats called depression|`|8LTQR4Xiaa	i do :)  but i don't think its a form of depression ..i think you subconsciously relax, making you less tense or upset so you feel refreshed when you wake up  :)|`|10b2c36737179bda3ebf63464494a884aa	Yes, most depressed people find comfort in sleep because they are escaping reality for a while. Anytime a reality isn't a good reality, sleep is always my answer. I have been depressed for years now and have slept away most of it. It does get better at times but, when times are hard, sleep will get you out of it. (that's my excuse anyway)   I wish you the best of luck in life. Take a fool's advise and sleep as little as you can because dealing with your problems is much better than sleeping them away. They never go away with sleep and always do when you deal with them.|`|AH3ZEBbYaa	Most definitely.    I have Major Depression and I used to sleep for days at a time sometimes.    I just didn't want to get out of bed because sleep is the closest thing to death/ escape from reality I could get.    Believe me, it's not healthy.|`|CLcGxHpAaa	Yes.  I love sleeping, it seems to be the only time when I am at total peace.|`|2EdVsgciaa	You're asking questions that just relate to me lol.  I sure do.  I can sleep all day if I wanted to.  It just makes me even more tired though.  I sleep to escape stress...but then, I have the craziest dreams about homework and everyday life
8H3csvDpaa	Side effect or not, shortness of breath is rarely a side effect nor safe, it should be taken very seriously. The hissing to me indicates possible narrowing of the bronchii or bronchial tubes. You should get this checked out very soon. If it truly is a side effect then your doctor needs to try something else that does not cause this. Shortness of breath can do more than just make you feel light headed, it also places a high burden on your heart.
bZhIEy1Waa	Your meds are quite strong and could possibly have a few side effects but to affect your lung's like that isn't normal! Go back to your doctor or go to your nearest A&E, you've a right to be treated in any hospital if you're concerned for your health. Put about 3 or 4 pillow's behind you when you go to bed so that your more upright - laying flat with a lung problem is more painful - check with a dr that you can take some muscle relaxants such as Ibuprofen 400mg or 600mg then see your GP again. I can't understand why he's not sent you for a chest x-ray??? Demand one when you see him again, it'll rule out any chest infections. Best of luck.|`|AA12349214	Dear god - even if it is a side effect of your pills you need them changed dont you!  Go back to the stupid doctor and tell him you dont actually want to live like that and could they re-jig the dose or change one of the pills so that you dont have these horrible side effects.  I'm sure animals get treated better by vets than some humans do by doctors you know.  Be strong and stick up for yourself hun.|`|OCgZACJqaa	Go back to your doctor and tell him you are not at all happy with his diagnosis, tell him that 'THINKING  it's a side effect of your pills' is not good enough, tell him you need to know for certain.    If he cannot tell you one way or another ask for a second opinion.
YC8X25OXaa	No, not really.  On 'Lost' that's all they can do because they don't have any decent medical supplies, but when your leg gets set 'in the real world', it needs a bit more work.    Basically setting a leg involves straightening the bones to make sure they are lined up properly (what you saw them do on 'Lost') and not going to knit back together to be bent or anything.  Then they will either put a cast on it or pin it, to ensure the bones stay in place while they re-attach.  Broken bones usually take about two months to heal, and after that they'll take off the cast or whatever they used to hold it in place.|`|e8af4a389087dfe559fec425f57e5c92aa	"setting it" is putting it back in place, so it can heal normally. If the bone was broken in half, you have to realign it, or set it.  This may also be for dislocations of the hip as well. TO fix that you have to pull the leg and put it back into the socket.|`|lAZWTLtRaa	I don't know the exact medical definition or anything but I'm pretty sure it means to put the bone back in line and brace the leg so the bone stays where it should in order for it to heal properly.  In science class many years ago, we watched a video about breaks and fractures, and sometimes operations have to be done if the break is serious.  Sometimes pins are inserted to hold the leg in place, and since it was LOST, they did what they could considering what they had to work with (are they still on the island? LOL I don't even watch it >_>)|`|urJIlSBQaa	It means to put the bone back in line and brace it so it doesn't move for it to heal.  Did you break a leg?|`|8cDd70dSaa	Usually, there is some sort of splint involved. To "set" it means to make it so that it doesn't move so it can heal.
tdN2ouxAaa	THAT IS NOT NORMAL!    There is DEFINITELY something wrong!!!    Please go to the doctor ASAP.|`|YtjygFACaa	THAT IS STRANGE ONLY LAST PART OF MONTH NOW CLUE SRRY BUT IS WEIRD|`|eLRhPpD6aa	dno
tdN2ouxAaa	It IS nasty! Thanks for posting this question!    I've had friends tell me that they've had sex on their period before, and I couldn't believe what I was hearing? Aren't these women concerned about the mess and the SMELL?    And I couldn't bear it myself, with the cramps, bloating, and discomfort.   NO, THANK YOU!    Remember when Martin Lawrence talked about this in his stand-up routine? He said that after you get done having sex with a woman who's on her period, it looks like a blood massacre occurred in the bedroom!    EEEWWWWW!!    And why the heck would a man want to have sex with a woman who's on her period???|`|0gdBjXb1aa	it helps with cramps and you get off the same...ya just gotta throw a towel down|`|DoooQw77aa	No it isn't nasty. There are ways to have sex while on your period that are clean. Like having sex in shower or laying down a towel (as already mentioned). Also, there actually have been reports that show that orgasms reduce menstrual cramps:    "Menstrual Cramps (Dysmenorrhea)    (...)    Treatment:        * Orgasm. Orgasm reduces the congestion of blood and fluid in the pelvic area."  (http://www.stanford.edu/group/SHPRC/ch3_...|`|dALX1qQdaa	its very nasty but there are slim chances of getting prego|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Why not?  I wouldnt do it with some random stranger, but the shower is a great place for me and my boyfriend when I have my period|`|coXqLeGdaa	For some girls it helps with cramps, its just like sex with extra lubrication.  nothing nasty about it, I myself don't do it cause all it does is seem to make my cramps worse
fMilDRgLaa	Has your doctor ran lab work on you yet? Does the doctor think it chronic fatigue syndrome or something else?  Not to scare you, but I think you need to see a doctor as soon as possible if you are at the point you are at. (I know from experience)  It could be a quick fix with the right medicine.  You KNOW yourself better than anyone.   Take care.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I am not familiar with the exact symptoms of chronic fatigue.  I do know that many autoimmune diseases can mimic chronic fatigue.  When I over do one day...I pay for it dearly the next couple days. I am guessing you don't have anemia which would be the obvious tests to do.  I get chills and fevers with at times when I have a flare up.  Do you feel well for short periods of time ever and them BAM you are knocked over for a good bit or is this never ending?  <br>  <br>  I would definitely talk to your teachers.  Can your parents talk to them too?  I would get them on board and tell them that you have been seeing a doctor.<br>  <br>  A lot of times our friends and family get angry with us because they are in denial something could be wrong with us.  They get frustrated because they don't know what to do to help. Hang in there. Demand blood work on everything...especially automimmune related.
xEoR8igxaa	Other than by growing there's not much you can do to get "long" legs. Though you can burn excess fat and tone the muscle you have.    Aerobic exercise, like running, riding a bike, walking, etc., not only burns fat, but also enhances your cardiovascular system, making you healthier in general.     Yoga and Pilates are great for developing core strength and flexibility.    Just don't get obsessive with the exercise. Keep it fun, and do it to be strong and healthy. If you get caught up in losing the weight you're gonna drive yourself mad.    This Web site has information on eating right and getting fit: http://www.findingdulcinea.com/guides/He...|`|SgKsHxD5aa	love handles? you dont have them... i know because im 5'3 and weigh 106... and im underweight, so you must be too......|`|b0faTDlJaa	No exersise is gonna burn fat from a praticular spot on your body but you can tone the specific parts.|`|3675a0a0bbcc0c96994e24e8e707620baa	squats are the best for leg muscles|`|RC2aQBkgaa	Running is a good option for legs. It's a great, natural, old rememdy for excersize. For abs, try cruntches, sit ups, and ESPECIALLY....6 INCH KILLERS! Oh my! Those are the best for abs. I did them almost every night at cheer practice. My abs were coming out real good, but now that I never do them my beautiful abs are gone :( But those help a lot.|`|DexBj220aa	Run.    Run like there's a crazy psycho killer running after you with a rusty knife.      Also, you might want to gain some weight, cuz you seem pretty small.
6YPVVsbwaa	drink a lot of fluids, preferably stuff like orange juice and lemonade, and rest, let your natural body defenses do their job, and eat hot chicken noodle soup..don't take vitamin C supplements, because you're system is weakened, it will take time for your digestive tract and liver to break it down..it's better just drink the juice, so this way, the vitamin C is more readily absorbed, because it is in liquid form.|`|2e103842ea492d6dca1571e0a0df8befaa	Emergen-C with a tsp of zinc every 2 hours (for a couple of days), along with zycam (sp?), humidifier, and either a neti pot or sinus rinse to clear out any mucous that has formed and mucinex. you may still get a bit of a cold but it shouldn't be as bad or last as long. i try to take Emergen-C at least once a day.     i had a sinus infection at the same time as a friend of mine. i did all of those things and i felt better within the week. she didn't do those things and ended up antibiotics and was sick for at least 2 weeks longer than i was.|`|AA11932938	Vitamin C 500 mg.-1000 mg. as soon as you feel it coming on, do not do it right before bed because it will make you have to pee a lot.  Also that Zicam nasal spray is said to work Wonders !!|`|SiiU9zkiaa	I actually have had great results using Zicam cold remedy. It's a zinc-based gel that goes right in the front part of your nostril which is where colds begin.. it supposedly prevents the cold virus from multiplying and entering your system. But anyway.. I love this stuff now, my family does too.

xRxaVMI1aa	I have had laser surgery done and I also work at the ophthalmologist's office where I had it done. You would have to have an evaluation to see if you are a candidate for surgery because it depends on the corneal thickness and what your prescription is. It is a very good surgery and I would recommend it to anyone. There are actually two different types of surgery. The Lasik is where you cut a flap in the cornea and laser underneath. The recovery time for this is only about 4-5 hours and the vision is pretty much immediately good. If your corneas are thin or you have dry eyes, the second option is called ASA. It's basically the same procedure except that the laser is done on the surface of the cornea. The recovery for this is 2-5 days because you have to give your corneas time to replace the cells that were removed. Also, since it's on the surface, it takes more time for the vision to come around. This is actually the safest, older version of laser surgery. Both are very good options. One thing, if you get Lasik, make sure the doctor does Intralase instead of a mechanical laser because the mechanical laser has a much higher rate of complications. You are awake for the surgery but you do not feel anything because they numb your whole eyeball. They also usually give you a relaxer so you're not nervous. The price can range from approx. $2000-2600 per eye depending on the procedure. Since you wear contacts, you will need to have them out for a certain amount of time before the measurements can be done. This is because contacts slightly change the shape of your eye. If you wear hard contacts they change the shape a lot more so it will need to be much more time out of contacts.|`|QSOxoEgzaa	I would try www.lasikfacts.info
H0aiDO9Paa	No one know for sure what causes twitching of the eyelid. Some doctors believe that rest and stress reduction may help. Sometimes pressing on the twitchy area for a few seconds provides temporary relief. If it hasn't gone away after three or four weeks, though, consult an eye-care specialist. If a thorough examination uncovers no underlying cause and the twitching is particularly severe and persistent, you may want to ask about the possibility of injecting botulinum toxin (Botox) to certain muscles around the eyes to stop the temporarily paralyzes muscles. And some doctor think that would be overkill for patient with chronic, unremitting eyelid spasms. And good luck.|`|sQu3LLqtaa	Could be a magnesium deficiency.

Men have breast tissue, so can get breast cancer.    Breast cancer surgery is usually a lumpectomy in which just the tumor and surrounding tissue is removed or a full mastectomy where all the breast tissue is removed.  Either is commonly accompanied by removal of adjacent lymph nodes.    This is the same for both men and women.
OPsvTjcXaa	chew gum instead|`|jJV4a5CUaa	hard candy i do it|`|dd6rgtL7aa	Ok, so here's the thing....this is no easy task. I know. I bit my nails for most of my 26 years of life. The way I stopped? I constantly kept an Emory board, cuticle trimmer and nail file in my possession at ALL times. If there was any issue of a hang nail, uneven nail, something under my nails, I used the tools....not my teeth. I made an effort to realize when I was putting my fingers in my mouth 100% of the time. And if I was? I'd pop a piece of gum in my mouth, or smear some hand lotion on my hands. Its tough to do, but its a full time job to quit. So, just realize it wont happen over night. Find out works for you....I'm not sure if you've tried the gross tasting nail polish either...it never worked for me, but it could for you. GOOD LUCK!      Addition: It also helps a lot if you paint your nails with a nail strengthener so you have strong nails when they grow in. That way, you won't be tempted to bite off weak nails.|`|sbeHyaCqaa	where nail polish so it will taste bad and then eventually  u will  stop biting them.|`|0MunIx8raa	Just think of what's under your nails.  If you scratch you have dead skin cells under them.  When you use the bathroom and you don't wash your hands you could have crap under them.  When you eat you get food under your nails and may not see it and you eat rotted food left under them.  Not to mention all the communicable diseases you pick up along your daily routine just by touching things other people have touched.  Think about how nasty it is every time you go to bite them.|`|YC8X25OXaa	What really helped me was putting clear nail varnish on them (wasn't allowed to wear nail varnish to school so it had to be clear!) because I hated the taste.  If you don't mind the taste, you can get special varnishes with really, really bad tastes designed specifically to stop people from biting their nails.    You could also try thinking about why you bite your nails - in what situations do you find yourself doing it?  When you're stressed?  Bored? Impatient?  Then try and stop yourself from getting into situations like that.  For example, I used to bite mine when I was stressed.  So whenever I got stressed and realised I was biting my nails, I sit on my hands and then work out why I was stressed (usually because I had to do something I didn't want to do) and deal with it straight away, so the need to bite my nails would vanish.    I managed to break myself of the habit after a couple of months, and I'm sure you will be able to as well!|`|9QL9Wpo8aa	Get a manicure so your nails will look so nice you won't want to ruin them.

Some people do it when they are nervous/stressed/bored/etc. Once you find out why it happens, the solution follows afterwards.    I pretty much do the same thing, just when I am stressed out. Knowing this, I am more aware of myself when stressed to prevent this from happening and I also make sure that I try to do as much as possible to not stress myself out.|`|2BY5CreXaa	My girlfriend recently found a way to beat this habit.

This habit can range from smoking to chewing with one's mouth open. A habit that some of the people do without consiso  usly knowing that they are doing it is biting their finger nails. Biting one's fingernails is not a habit that endangers anyone else but it is slightly annoying to see someone who always has their fingers in their mouth. Also by always having their fingers in their mouths people who bite their finger nails have a greater chance of getting sick because of always having their hand one and near their face. There are several ways to help break this habit.    1) Polish    By paint one's fingernail it helps prevent biting them in a couple of ways. First, the polish will make one's fingernails not taste awful but not great either. Secondly, instead of biting their nails a person with the habit can simple pick the polish off instead, this is not a way of completely breaking the habit but is a step in the right direction. Lastly, if someone is conscious of the fact that their nails look nice, then they will also be more conscious of what they are doing in regards to biting their finer nails.    2) The Buddy System    By having a friend or family member tell the person with the habit when they are biting their fingernails, it will also make them more aware of when and why they bite their finger nails. While, at the same time helping them stop by keeping it at the front of their mind.    3) Concentrate    It is not a small issue; if it is important to a person to break any habit then they should take it seriously and concentrate on breaking the habit. The person trying to break the habit should not down play the importance of breaking the habit if it is something that they want to do.    4) Don't Do It for Any Reason    If the person has a hang nail or a piece of their finger nail breaking off, they should not bite it off because breaking the habit is a all or nothing process, instead they should tear it off or find finger nail clippers.    5) Acrylics  If after trying to break the habit for an extended period of time and little has been accomplished in regards to breaking the habit then the person can have acrylic finger nails put on, this changes the feel of the nails when trying to bite them and they not break off changing the benefits and feeling received from the habit.    6) Bad Tasting    By placing either something spicy or bad tasting on one's nails they will be aware of when they are biting their nails and will also be less likely to do it because of the taste.|`|NAvaa1Araa	There's this really nasty clear polish that you can buy that prevents you from biting them. It tastes really bad! I don't remember what it's called though. You can buy it at Drugstores though. My cousin used to have the same habit, then her dad bought her some of that and she stopped doing it. I even put some on my nails once to see how it tasted, and it was sick, but it really helps. And don't listen to the other people who told you to do drugs. I wish you luck!|`|AUFf5Oinaa	You could get that nail varnish, however when you pick things out your teeth and stuff its horrible.    Also get your nails done, but you may bite them off so that could ruin them.     If you don't mind paying i suggest gel nails, it allows your nails to grow underneath, it looks lovely and does not damage them!!  Then when they start to grow out you can get them refilled dead cheap.   And when they are taken off your nails will look so nice you won't want to bite them!  :)    Hope i have helped!    x|`|cYsPx9sSaa	theres a nail varnish, and theres this powder thing as well, buy it from the chemist or a nail accessories shop. apply it on your nail and it tastes disgusting!!! just make sure you wash your hands before you eat anything or thats gonna taste raw too =D|`|85965c9edd1edbf84c07407fddee197caa	Just tell yourself that it is nasty to bite your nails and stick to not bting them.|`|fKmYie8Yaa	try using your hands for other things, like playing piano|`|n3Itf69Qaa	dip then ends of your fingers in something that tastes horrid like vinegar, u can buy this Liquid that u put on your nails but vinegar should work fine|`|8chsXCH7aa	my friend used to bite her nails all the time but she started getting her nails done and she didn't want to mess them up so she stopped biting them.   now she never does it|`|wioDZFv2aa	you are low in calcium so eat more pine apple,cantaloupe,papaya,milk, and cheese.|`|xOqhA1Unaa	I'VE BEEN PUTTING TAP ON MY FINGERNAILS, IT KINDA WORKS, MAYBE GET FAKE NAILS!|`|mQ7ZAFd6aa	rub **** on your nails. every time that finger comes close to your nose P...U... get that hand away from there.|`|F2XxqlVfaa	habenero juice (sorry im not a good speller)|`|t0mb150gaa	You could try putting something on your nails that you don't like the taste of for a little bit each day or use gloves on your hands for a few days to break the habit.|`|8TmK8Qklaa	my sister bit her nails for years and she said what worked for her was having a baby and not wanting to put the same fingers she just used to change a diaper into her mouth.    so umm have a baby.|`|ZhrL1Vszaa	Spray, dip, or rub something nasty tasting/smelling on ur fingernails that should do it, like superglue, so even when it dries u'll still have a tough time trying 2 bite ur nails.|`|uAzBvk5gaa	paint them all the time.  im sure you dont wanna eat nail polish|`|YktN7dEyaa	get a manicure but make it a challenge...say i will get myself a manicure if i dont bite em' for a month straight. that way they get longer for your manicure and u win!|`|ML7FRVzIaa	Buy those things at a drug store to stop making you bite your nails!

I did that for a year and did not bite my finger nails during that period.  Once I achieved what I was trying to achieve I went right back to chewing.  I like them.

Sometime they bled|`|4IYKRhxIaa	i used to have the same habit! what i did was i put bandaids on the top of my fingers and had them like that so i couldn't get to my nails. sometimes that was annoying like when i had to open like a ziplock bag so i sometimes put on gloves. when you need your hands for something, i just took off the gloves. the work kept them busy so i wouldn't chew my fingernails. then i slipped back on the gloves. it is one of the most common habits and hard to get over. i hope this helped a lot!|`|Tc23KWgzaa	You're a girl, right?

u95CsOUHaa	Hi.  Your calories from fat should not be more than 1/3 of your calories taken in.  In simple terms, you must read labels to see how much fat is in foods you are consuming.  To be on the safe side, I'd say 2-3 Tablespoons of fat per day.     Also, it's important to eat the right kinds of fat like monounsaturated fat (olive oil, avocado)  those are healthy fats.  It's still fat even though it's healthy. Limit your fat intake to 2-3 tablespoons a day and make sure you are not eating other high fat foods.|`|qy7C8Ybvaa	i think its like 20 grams or a bit more. though it really does depend on your body type, your activity level, metabolism so on and so forth. but i think 100 grams might be a bit excessive. hope it helps.|`|AU4LAtqMaa	it depends on your age and size.  you can read the nutrition lables

6MwIvHlNaa	Cardio is the best thing for weight loss (because it burns a lot of calories).    Strength training is for building muscle which in turn helps with the cardio because your legs / arms / torso are stronger.    Weight training isn't essential, leave it till you feel more comfortable with your weight.|`|rgaX3I56aa	Jump on a treadmill, put it as fast as you can and raise it all the way up. this will burn tons of fat calories and tone your body up. Also, I lost 33 pounds with the help of desert burn hoodia. I am a real person with a total success story and i can prove it. After you're done reading this GOOGLE: online health desert burn hoodia : cut and paste it, and it will take you to my site and you can see my pic, the same pic that's here on my profile and read my true weight loss story. I did what I told you to do and lost 33 pounds in just over 2 months and toned up pretty nicely I might ad!!! Hoodia seriously works so if you need a little help controlling your appetite and some will power, hoodia will definitely help you. Also, take a look at the treadmill and hiking pages. Walking type exercises are even better than running. Take care and hope you achieve all of your goals. Cole F.  Walking and the treadmill are the best ways to tone up and lose weight and they won't kill your knees like running.  Eat lots of protein and fiber.  Here's are some pages below that will help you.  Also:  GOOGLE: online health mart treadmill  :It should be like the 3rd hit to read about how I used the treadmill, amongst a good diet to lose 33 pounds.  Anyhow, I hoped this helps you out.

Cole F.|`|2FajbNP4aa	The core principle of losing weight is to burn more calories than you take in.  So as long as the ratio is correct, weight will come off.    The best way to lose weight is through sensible eating and regular exercise, regardless of what it is - in my opinion.    Muscle burns more calories than fat, so if you have a higher muscle-to-fat ratio your metabolic rate will be higher, and hence burn more calories.  However, fat will get burned through physical activity of any type as long as you are consistent and are active long enough.    Kudos to you for getting active; and good luck to you!|`|e7d09a951976b57160bf67ee2c9d3754aa	I think you can lose weight without strength training, but it's better if you lift some very light weights, 3 to 5lbs dumbbells. Of course, you're worried that you're gonna gain muscle and look bulky but it's not going to happen if you create a calorie deficit in your diet.     I'm gonna tell you what Jillian Michaels, trainer on Biggest Loser, recommends for losing weight (because I've been listening to her and it's paying off). 1200 to 1600 calories a day (I say stay in the 1200 and 1400 area because you're young and it seems you've adjusted to "dieting mode" and it won't bee very hard to stick to 1200). Exercise, both cardio and strength. The reason we should make use of the dumbbells is because lifting weights creates micro-tears in the muscles and the body burns more calories to repair them after the workout. That's why strength training elevates metabolism after the workout more than aerobic exercise does. Plus, muscles burns more than fat.    Your medicine ball will be very good for the abs, I know a lot of exercises that require the ball. But do invest in some dumbbells that you can use at home, for the days you won't go to the gym or for when you'll simply want some variety in your workout and invest in a workout DVD.    Anyway, stick to your diet and your cardio workout regime. If you're diligent about it, it will get results. For example, try to use the inclined option of the treadmill. Even if you simply walk and not run on the incline trainer you'll do some form of a toning exercise. But at some point you will need to start strength training.

2sycPf8Daa	Sometimes people try to avoid preparing for a job interview. They might be worried about answering difficult questions, so they avoid the issue and hope for the best.Sorry to hear about your worry, your feelings. Honestly, there is no quick fix for life, so you can't expect one.     You need to take things slowly, and see how they end up working out. If not go see a counsellor for some help. You're not stuck...stuck is a choice that you've made so make the choice to get unstuck one step at a time but you need to begin to take responsibility for your own life and not blame others for where you are. Getting moving...the sooner you do the sooner you will have both feet unstuck.    Plan to follow your dream. Plan to "do" for the rest of your life, precisely that which you would just love doing almost all the time, in your spare time, when you're robbing time from other chores.   WHATEVER IT IS, YOU MUST BECOME the Best THAT YOU CAN POSSIBLY BECOME AT IT. Life won't come to you. You have to go get it. You can decide that your stuck and live everyday with a miserable helplessness, or you can choose to make YOUR choices in YOUR life.    You sound like a great person who's losing themselves in their life. Find some defiance in you. After all, the world runs according to survival of the fittest. By not standing up and making your decisions, you're saying that you're not strong enough to deal with the challenges that thousands of people deal with every day. I'm sure this isn't true. Don't prove it to me or others, prove it to yourself.    Take care as always!
Lyjy3xO7aa	Multiply your weight by 10.  This is the amount of calories you need to burn in a day just to maintain that weight.  Now subtract the 1000 calories per day that you are eating, and add the 400 exercise calories back in.     This number is the amount of calories your body will now have to make up by getting them from other places. like existing body fat.  That's how you lose weight.    There are about 3000 calories to a pound of fat, so you can do the math from there.|`|F2XxqlVfaa	you wouldnt loose much per day and i dont care how few calories you eat.|`|1N2wBw3Uaa	uhm, in order to lose, you have to burn more than you eat.|`|TOls0c2haa	its unhealthy and bad for you|`|hkTwclOsaa	well as long as you burn 3500 calories a week you should be able to eat more|`|GXrHjEgvaa	Without knowing how old you are, how much you weigh, how long you intend to do it, there is no way to tell.

At the same time you will be gaining muscule and burning fat. So its awesome.       WHAT YOU'LL NEED: Two 5 pounds weights.  * means one 5 pound weight in each hand.    If you don't have two 5 pound weights try using water bottles full of water.      Workout:  Stretch  *20 Bench Press x3   20 squats x3  *20 side arm lifts x3  20 crunches x3  20 push-ups x3  *20 lunges x3  20 leg lifts x3  Walk for 30 mins  Stretch    Stretching before your workout helps you not to pull a muscule during your workout.    Stretching after your workout helps you not be AS sore afterward.     I try to do this everyday, but I'm sure you would get results doing this only 2-4 days a week. I recomend everyday.      Eat 1500 calories a day and drink 8 glasses of water daily.    You will lose weight and tone up!      I've lost 6 pounds and I've only been doing it for a week!      You can do it! i know you can!    You will be sore. and it will hurt but you can do it.    Don't be scared to add more excercises of more reps.      Hope this works for you!|`|7ldEn0fJaa	um 1|`|3se8BaJLaa	Okay you ate 1000 calories and you exercise and burn 400 calories. 1000 - 400 = 600 calories still left. you aren't losing weight|`|YW74O9aNaa	wow...thats a very polite way to ask a question :)  anyway, About 3,500 calories adds up to about 1 pound. This applies whether they are food calories coming in, or calories (burned by exercise) going out.  If you eat 3,500 calories more than your body needs, you will put on about 1 pound. If you use up 3,500 calories more than you eat, you will lose about 1 pound in weight.  So do your math now!|`|D8KgIX8naa	3000 calories = 1 pound    Let's say you wanted to weigh 120 lbs then you should eat 1200 calories a day to maintain that weight. If you wanted to lose 10 lbs and were eating 1000 calories a day and burning 400 then your total calories for the day would be 600 (600 less than the 1200 to maintain a weight of 120lbs) So it would take you 5 days to lose each pound (600 calories times 5 days = 3000 calories or 1 pound)    Hope this helped and makes sense!|`|u95CsOUHaa	Okay, you don't want "bullshit answers".  It takes a deficit of 3,500 calories to lose one pound.  You do the math.        FYI:  If you plan on doing what your post says, make sure you have some type of medical insurance plan. You're going to need one after you pass out and get taken to the ER.|`|6UDxXsieaa	well i eat 1000 calories aday and do yoga for 30min/1hr     and ive lost 16 lbs in a month     i would try it for a month and then go to 1200-1500 calories for another month just keep switching how many calories you eat and you'll lose weight     just don't go all crazy because eating only 1000 calories a day isn't healthy for very long and you wont be able to lose weight if you dont switch up how many calories you eat     good luck|`|gNGhjNwyaa	if you have a 2000 calorie daily diet and you take off 1000 cals then you would lose 2 pounds a week. and since your also burnin off 400 more ittl be about 3 pounds a week

Some of the grumbling is hunger. the other stuff is gas bubbles moving around. theyre trapped and floating around trying to get out so thats the noise.
oE77lovwaa	I had to get mine taken out last year because I had braces a couple of years ago. They were still in my gums and weren't causing any pain, shifting, or anything at all. My dentist/orthodontist took a recent x-ray of my jaw just for records and sent me to a maxillofacial surgeon to have them extracted.    You can have them pulled for several reasons, mine probably isn't common because mine had not even broken through my gums yet, they would have just caused problems later on with all the work that my braces had done to my teeth.    You never know, depending on the way your wisdom teeth grow in you may not have to have them extracted. It all depends on the situation and how ever many you have. Either way if you have the money to do it, it may be a good thing to look into if you're having moderate pain now it may save you from severe pain later on.    Good luck.|`|114a9e7f24177ba552a0e5c76a745e27aa	if the wisdom teeth are impacted, infected or preventing normal development in the front then yes you need them out. some dentists advise it as a routine thing. Go see your dentist and ask. if he/she thinks you need this done you'll be referred to an oral surgeon
aOmDuXubaa	It might just be that all the muscles of your core (hips, thighs, buttocks, lower back and abs) are all tight and in deep spasm. When they are tight they contort and this is what pulls your lower back and pelvis out of alignment and this is what causes your discomfort and sciatica. the best thing for this is inversion therapy. When inverting all of these muscles are free to stretch out and relax. As they do the knots come out of those muscles and as they are free and lose they will release their grips on your lower back, hips and pelvis and allow them to go back into alignment naturally. Once they are realigned nothing will be irritating your sciatic nerve and your pain will go away. You just have tight muscles that need to be stretched out. Stress causes this too by the way. Hope you feel better and hope this helps you.  take care and feel better!!!|`|gsfNJ00Jaa	U may have torn something or it could be a hernia. Do you have any knots in that area? If you are on insurance then a MRI should not cost much. U can also go to the ER and they can do more than an x-ray. They can do an ultrasound on ur muscles. Hope this helps|`|VLjJCBO7aa	sounds like you had sex a little too hard|`|BDlS6XdGaa	If it hurts on the inside it sounds like a torn groin muscle to me, sorry to let you know.  If it hurts on the outside then it would be a hip flexor tendon you injured.  You need that MRI.  Talk to your insurance provider becuase they will typically cover the fee with the exception of a copay unless you haven't met your deductible for the year.
UL3XOKJxaa	Depends on the individual...but 4-6 weeks usually allows for sufficient healing. Good Luck
mhvb9eFkaa	Are they impacted?  Mine were!  The first thing they did was the numbing (Novocaine) injections...several of them all over my mouth.  The next thing may sound pretty bad but, the dentist took a chisel and a mallet and broke the teeth into several pieces (to make extraction easier!) and before I knew it, it was over.  No serious pain, just some pressure.  The bad part came later due to dry socket.  Listen to them when they tell you how to take care after the extraction.  I didn't and suffered for days.  Now I smile every chance I get!  ;-)  Good Luck!|`|taMKteLVaa	I've never had mine taken out but i have friends that have, people react to it differently; like about a week ago my friend got his out and his face swelled up and he missed like a week of school. Although one of my other friends got hers out last year and only missed one day. So as i said it just depends(:  good luck, girrl :D|`|Vv6FPagvaa	It's not really a big deal. They'll numb you up. What their going to do is just extract your teeth. ever had an extraction? well its the same thing. Their going to take a hooked type tool. They will pull it up from the roots it may hurt a little. Not much depends on how much they numb you. Your teeth will come out. They'll stitch you up and voila. All better =D I haven't gotten mine out but i can guarantee you its just like getting an extraction. Sorry i don't know what the tool is. I got some teeth pulled for orthodontic reasons and i was scared so i closed my eyes. I didn't wanna see what they were using cause then i knew i would just get freaked out haha. But don't worry it wont hurt like hell. Just pinches here and there. Its no biggie.   Hope it Helps  Nathalie ?|`|8d57142bd67cd4a69caf09b963f2fcbdaa	I just had all four of mine taken out about a year ago. I was nervous about it cause I heard it hurt, but it didn't. Basically your under general anesthesia and when you wake up you feel no pain the only thing is that your cheeks and stuff will be numb for a week which is good cause you will feel no pain.|`|EpVfTisyaa	I had mine taken out. I was put under general anaesthetic so I didn't feel or see a thing. It hurt but not as bad as I thought it would.|`|ZzKGxoYqaa	I waited to get my wisdom tooth out mostly because I didn't have any insurance.  It didn't hurt that much for me but then again it could of been because it was killing me before I had it taken out so it was more of a relief to me.  I didn't think it was bad at all.   Good Luck!!!!

g3MBOYDPaa	Its funny you asked because I felt the same way about a month ago until I went to the doctor for help. I came to realize that the reason I was bored was because I had lost all interest in the things I used to like to do. I was constantly tired and even the thought of getting up and out of the house was too much to even think about. I hated being stuck in the house but at the same time going out didn't provide any enjoyment. Long story short I went to the doctor and these are the questions he asked.    1. are you always tired? Yes  2. have you gained or lost weight recently? yes... i had gained  3. have you lost in interest in hobbies? yes  4. thoughts of hurting yourself? yes  5. irritable and moody? yes   he asked a few more but it was clear I was depressed. He didnt send me to a psychiatrist but he prescribed me wellbutrin sr. I have been on it a month a I feel a lot better. I can smile now and actually get out of bed. On top of that I stopped smoking after 13 years, it took away all of my urges which it is supposed to do but I didn't believe it.  So i suggest if you have been feeling this way for more than a couple of weeks I think its time to see your doctor. Plain old boredom shouldn't last that long. I hope this helps.|`|3XWxs1ruaa	well if you are really are depressed i suggest u talk to someone. also about bored go out with friends, excercise, talk to people, go on internet, go on youtube, or go out. also going out and stuff may make u feel better. hope this helped good luck|`|ruenEu8Yaa	prozac for the depression    yahoo answers for the boredom    there... you're cured!|`|utlHkYL9aa	see a doctor and stay on yahoo answers.. lol|`|Znzx92mEaa	I've lost the only thing that has ever meant anything to me and I'm depressed as all hell.

If you think your bored with life in general or a job or school then you may need to make a change. Make plans and dates with friends, or a family member that is supportive. Help someone who may be in need, a friend or going to a shelter or food kitchen to help. It can be very helpful to do service to those less fortunate than others.

Im surprised he doesnt have Hirsprungs as well.. if its just functional constipation.. i wouldnt advise senna for anyone esp a child as long term use damages the nerves in the bowel... current recommendations are for thigs like parachoc and best of all is movicol.. the idea behind functional constiaption is that it hurts so much for bub to do a poo as its hard and rock like to pass they they learn to hold it in as long as possible and its a cycle they get into.. so the treatment is to use laxatives.. ie movicol for as long as possible to get them out of the habit of haolding it in... the idea is to make the poo like a slurry. ie softer than normal poo for at least 6 months and the kid learns that it wont hurt anymore and things often correct them selves.. but he sounds pretty severe and a gastroenterology reveiw is still appropriate.  good luck|`|SnTuaKcJaa	Have they done an MRI of his spine?

zEy0uuAFaa	This is a part of the natural male sexual response, called the refractory period.  After ejaculation, sexual interest diminishes and the man becomes incapable of ejaculation for a while.  Often the erection goes away at this time, but not always.  This probably developed as an adaptation that kept men from spending all their seed in one place, so they would have better reproductive success by spreading it around if they had the opportunity.    You probably think of this state as being "pure" because you've been trained to think of sexual interest as impure or sinful.  A vigorous interest in sex is healthy and normal.  The pleasure of orgasm reinforces this, and naturally motivates us to recreate the experience.  If you ignore your sexual impulses and live like a monk, your body will eventually get the message and stop pestering you about it, but I personally don't think it's worth it.|`|AN5L6hTHaa	you work to get to that state and when you reach it you are done that is it.

We are here to ensure that the genes which we received from our ancestors continue to exist after our death.

DcEBhY02aa	Masturbating is perfectly normal. Even for christians, don't take it so seriously no where in the bible it says don't masturbate. Don't be scared do not fear your body.

Go ahead jack away.|`|upqJU9yiaa	Look I used to want to stop masterbating too because I thought it was a sin and it was gross and whatever but the truth is its actaully good for you and its wayy better for you to masterbate than go out and have sex with random people.     I know now that there is nothing wrong with masterbating, its not a sin cause ive asked at church and researched it and that pretty much every guy does it. It's normal and its part of what makes us guys you know? To stop masterbating is like telling a girl to stop having her period.       So just dont worry about it, stop think about it so much and it'll be alright. Once I stopped worrying I just masterbated once and didnt masterbate for 3 days or so and it just slowly gets boring. Just dont stress.

By masturbating you're doing something healthy AND preventing a sticky mess when you wake up.|`|AA11565057	I don't think it's wrong to masturbate. From a Biblical point of view, you're committing many, many other 'sins' on a daily basis and will be going to hell regardless - for example, I don't think your toilet is far away from your house - which is as great a 'sin' as masturbation. I also don't think you're begging God for forgiveness about it because you don't view it as wrong. Why be so worried about a single law in the Bible? All sins are meant to be equal in the eyes of God :)    The laws in the Bible should have been followed historically, but many of them are simply not relevant today. When the Bible was written, it was important for people to have as many children as possible to ensure the survival of the species. Now there is an overpopulation problem on Earth and humans are in absolutely no danger of dying out... Unless we continue to misuse the natural resources on the planet and precipitate a global catastrophe. It's no longer logical or appropriate to marry young and have as many children as possible.    You do not need to stop masturbating. Masturbation is normal and healthy. In fact, Masturbation (ejaculation) is a major preventer of prostate cancer in men. Medical studies have shown that men who masturbate daily and ejaculate are less likely to develop prostate cancer. Your health is literally in your hands. Having sex on a daily basis could potentially have the same effect, but I assume you're not old enough to have a girlfriend or be married so that's out of the picture.    I think you should get to know the body that God gave you and enjoy it. We have the capacity to feel physical pleasure for a reason :)      EDIT: To those who have stated the Bible says it's a sin to masturbate, the Bible doesn't state it like that. It says it's a sin for a man to sill one's seed on the ground. Technically speaking, if someone masturbates into a tissue or other vessel, they're not going against what the Bible has to say. I don't think most people make that distinction though.

iZk9jEBpaa	I also get these often especially in my tummy, my friends describe it as a kicking baby (how cute) lol, anyway as far as i'm aware it's harmless. Maybe you are lacking of potassium?

You can get more information by searching for fasiculation.    Some muscle twitching is benign and have no known cause. Just about everyone experiences this at some point in their life.    Sometimes muscle twitching has a cause.  Some causes      Diet deficiency   Drug overdose (caffeine)   Drug side effect (such as from diuretics, corticosteroids, or estrogens)   Exercise   Twitches not caused by disease or disorders (benign twitches)   Often affecting the eyelids, calf, or thumb   Normal and quite common, often triggered by stress or anxiety   Come and go, and do not last for more than a few days   Nervous system conditions that can cause muscle twitching:    Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS - Lou Gehrig's disease)   Damage to the nerve that leads to a muscle   Muscular dystrophy   Spinal muscular atrophy   Weak muscles (myopathy)     Symptoms that suggest a nervous system disorder include:    Loss of, or change in sensation   Loss of muscle size (wasting)   Weakness     If you are worried about the twitches then I suggest seeing your doctor or a neurologist.
MWdDBMHsaa	When you sleep and there is no outside noise, then any light or small noise is amplified. For example if you go to sleep with the tv on but at a low volume, chances are you will wake up to find the sound on the tv is louder then when you went to sleep. With your husband being a light sleep this can cause a lot of sleepless nights for him.    I have the same issue with my husband, except he snores and I'm the light sleeper. What we do is have a fan running on my side of the bed. It's an oscillating fan that produces white noise. We don't have the fan pointing at us or anything but the sound of the white noise blocks out every other noise and I swear I have never had better sleep in my life.     I also drink a cup of warm milk and honey to help me get into deeper sleep.|`|6rSBVcQ4aa	Smack him in the head with a 2x4. Or, have him drink a glass of wine or whiskey before bed, that's what I do. If it becomes a real problem move into a different bedroom if you have one, or make him sleep on the couch. Just because he can't sleep doesn't mean you shouldn't.

go8QFRtXaa	He has genital herpes or oral herpes (like cold sores)?    If he had oral herpes, then she's not going to catch it from semen. If he had genital herpes, then yes it's a possibility as the virus can be present in semen, but it's usually passed by skin to skin contact.    If he had an outbreak of genital herpes at the time, her risk of getting it is pretty high. If he had no symptoms or outbreak, her risk is reasonably low (but it's still possible).    The only way to know for sure is a test, if he has genital herpes.     EDIT:    OK, Herpes type 2 (HSV2) is genital herpes. So there is a risk that she could have gotten it in her mouth from semen contact. But it's a fairly small risk. It's not as common (though it is possible and these cases are increasing) to be infected with HSV2 in your mouth. It's also not common (though it is possible) to get infected if he had no outbreak or symptoms at the time.    Hope this helps, and hopefully she didn't pick it up. But your friend needs to be a bit more careful if this guy has HSV2. I'm guessing she knows that now!|`|qYCeR1fKaa	no she cant get herpes from dry c*m. I don't know why she is freaking out! Are u sure she didn't do something else with him & is not letting u know.

Take a look trust me u wil learn alot i did.|`|P5VpQnNOaa	maybe u should have asked, her if he was contaminated. dont worry probably not. but be careful|`|n3Itf69Qaa	well, it depends, if the herpes is still alive in the semen, and when its on ur fingers u ingest it in some way (eg. licking ur fingers etc) then yes, but otherwise no|`|satoCRC6aa	not good, she can catch it very easily   it may not show up and be visible  repeated trips to the doctor or clinic will be necessary|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	then why is there *** on the pillow? is your neice a hoochy?? and I dont know the answer to your question, just wanted to comment because you made her sound bad, poor girl.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Well, HSV does not come from semen, so Im thinking she is just fine.  Oh, and she wouldnt be getting sores on her face from his penis anyways.  2 different strains of HSV.    EDIT - Okay...again I say, you cant get herpes that way!  Oh my gosh...its like saying you can get them from a toilet seat!!!  And the HSV strains are very different.  Google it.  And while Im on this...it sounds kinda like a BS story that she got semen on her that way.
tdN2ouxAaa	She should visit her family doctor.    Women usually don't grow very much or AT ALL after they start menstruating.    Speaking for myself, I'm 5'5" and have been that height since I started my period at 13.    But there's nothing wrong with being five feet tall!|`|JrCaPAYIaa	I agree with the other people.. once you begin menstruating you usually do stop growing shortly thereafter. I started at the age of 12 and I'm 5'1" and I haven't grown since then. I will always be this short and I'm personally ok with it. It happens.. also it could be due to other things such as an under active pituitary gland, this is the gland that gives off growth hormones.|`|Ws1qOP1Haa	shes only 14 shes still growing look at her parents how tall are they this can give you an idea of how tall you'll be|`|dNeBha8zaa	Mmmm....she could still grow one or two more inches, but I doubt three. Remind her that shorter people are just as awesome as tall people, if not better! I am 5'1 and 14 myself and personally I really like my height. Good luck. :)|`|71204fadefeb0aef75f4761be2bfbc09aa	Hey!  I did a study on height and normally a girl stops growing 1-2 years after she gets her period. Height is genetic so this girl's parents heights will give a good idea what height she should be. How tall are they?  She might grow more, but there is no guarantee. To give herself the best chance, eat healthy food (not junk) and get enough sleep.  If she wants more advice she can contact me through my profile. I also have tips on how to look taller than you really are, which she might like.  Simon  ;-)
o9qWYVA9aa	Eat when you are hungry.  I'm in the same boat as you.  I can't even keep it down if I eat before I am ready first thing.  It's a good rule of thumb to eat within two hours of waking up.  By that time, I am usually hungry enough to eat a little.  Then after that, eat a snack between breakfast and lunch, and another between lunch and dinner.  Or when you are hungry.  Your body is the best expert on you.  Listen to it first before others.  After all, you have more experience with your body than anyone else.|`|PTYHS1LDaa	Well, I would eat a small breakfast, let it be some fruit, or a bowl of cereal!  What is wrong with a quick glass of milk in the morning, or even a nutrigram or granola bar!  I would have a quick little something, just to give you energy, and keep you healthy...but not too filling!  By the way, I have always wondered why we have last names.  I do not mind the first names  :)|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	I eat anyway,  I don't care if I'm hungry or not.

Dhz4XgQ3aa	Try camomile lotion on it this will help with the itching. Also take an antihistamine in case its an allergy too.     Do the glass test also to check if it disappears when you roll it over. If it doesnt go straight to A&E.    Def try the antihistamine though, this will also help with the itching too.     Get to GP as soon as you can.

You can go to a doctors without being registered there, you just need the details of your own doctor for their records.    then you should sign up with a doctor because it makes sense to have one at uni.
bfb88160853edd441f13c069712a5c16aa	The rule is:  If the sore throat is the main problem and you don't have runny nose or sneezing (signs of a cold).  then it's more than likely strep throat.  Of course the first day might be all sore throat but then after that you would get the runny nose etc.  That would also be a cold.      If you get a bad sore throat that lasts more than 3 days without improvement and no signs of a cold.

5kXxr6r0aa	20kg (or around 44.5 pounds) is good for a few workouts, especially if you're a power lifter, but if your looking for an athletic improvements outside of lifting, or just trying to improve the way you look, i'd suggest getting 15 or 20 pound dumbells (dunno what that would be in kg). its a weight that you'll find very versatile along the lines of which workouts you'll be capable of doing with them for a reasonable amount of reps.    its really based on what you wanna do, if you're really strong then go for maybe 15kg (like 34.4 pounds), but only if you've got a lot of experience in the gym.|`|b1feaaa978d115c4f2ff497d30752baaaa	I would try this workout. At the same time you will be gaining muscule and burning fat. So its awesome.       WHAT YOU'LL NEED: Two 5 pounds weights.  * means one 5 pound weight in each hand.    If you don't have two 5 pound weights try using water bottles full of water.      Workout:  Stretch  *20 Bench Press x3   20 squats x3  *20 side arm lifts x3  20 crunches x3  20 push-ups x3  *20 lunges x3  20 leg lifts x3  Walk for 30 mins  Stretch    Stretching before your workout helps you not to pull a muscule during your workout.    Stretching after your workout helps you not be AS sore afterward.     I try to do this everyday, but I'm sure you would get results doing this only 2-4 days a week. I recomend everyday.      Eat 1500 calories a day and drink 8 glasses of water daily.    You will lose weight and tone up!      I've lost 6 pounds and I've only been doing it for a week!      You can do it! i know you can!    You will be sore. and it will hurt but you can do it.    Don't be scared to add more excercises of more reps.      Hope this works for you!|`|u95CsOUHaa	Well, that all depends.  In general, it is best to start out with the lowest weights possible.  Although you probably are strong, it is easy to overestimate your strength.  Weights come in 1, 2, 3 pounds.  I recommend starting out with 3 pound or 2 pound weights.  For triceps and biceps, these weights are perfect.  Remember, you don't want to injure yourself.
0rpN2419aa	Yes, it does sound like you have SAD.  I live in Oregon and hate it when they change Daylight Savings Time.  I am a person who likes the outdoors, light, and brightness of spring and summer colors.  We do have a lot of green here, so it is still pretty, but early darkness is difficult to deal with for people who love the outdoors as much as I do.  They have a light of some sort that is supposed to help, but I haven't looked it up.  I have generalized anxiety disorder that is much worse in winter.  The darkness makes me feel like I want to go to bed much earlier than I should.      Good luck in finding the answers you need.|`|Z6ARD2iYaa	Sounds like it.

You know you're going to be hungry,  so prepare healthy things ahead of time.  You're obviously in your age group where you're growing  alot so with all the energy you;re burning the hungrier  you're going to get because that's where you get energry from to do things.

When I was dieting (and believe me I still watch my weight even though I have achieved my weight loss goals for the most part) I realized right off that the most important thing is to control your appetite. If your stomach's not always growling and your not always craving food it is sooo much easier to stick to your guns and stay on your diet. With hoodia I would literally go a whole day sometimes and simply forget to eat and I didn't get tired and run down like diets can sometimes make you feel. Once my appetite was under control and I wasn't always thinking about eating then and only then could the weight start coming off consistently and steadily because the hoodia kept my mind off of food and I would go longer on my diet and as I did that naturally I lost weight. You have to remember that consistency is very important when losing weight. If you cut back a little on your food consumption everyday with the help of hoodia your body will change (stomach will shrink and you won't be eating as much) and with that consistency over a few days, weeks and months you will lose weight just like I did. Hoodia was my saving grace for all of these factors and I was so pleased with the results that I was inspired to start my own online wellness site after I dropped my 33 pounds. If you don't believe me, look at my profile picture here and then GOOGLE: online health desert burn hoodia :and you will see that that picture is actually me after losing my 33 pounds that I have on my web site. If you decide to get some after reading this and want to get some through my site I will love you forever but if not, get some anyway just make sure it's 100% hoodia gordonii like desert burn is. The junk they sell at GNC is just that junk. Anyhow, I hope you achieve all of your goals. This can really help you if you give it a chance. sincerely, Cole F.   Hope this helps!!!|`|WU7xMQCyaa	You sound normal don't worry but keep an eye on your weight|`|haAtwu3iaa	My biggest trick to staying thin is portion control.  Drink lots of water also, this will keep you hydrated.    Stop eating what's bad for you and start eating what's good for you.

There are healthy foods that taste just as good, but have fewer calories, fat, and carbs.      - hope this helped!|`|JAXziu1baa	your body is naturally preparing you to be able to get pregnant, and you need to be above a certain weight to be abl to norish a baby, thats why anorexic people stop having their periods - because their body can handle to possibility of being pregnant.    try drinking a glass of water before eating your meals.... you'll get fuller much much quicker .|`|v6yEkCvHaa	cos when ure at college u dont really have any proper structure or set meals and that - ure just grazing it is normal but ull regret it if ure unlucky and put on a bit of weight over the year - you sound slim in ure weight and healthy - so either get active and just move about alot or try to just cut out the toast and things like that - but if u stay active i wouldnt worry too much- like dont let it take up ure every though or youll just end up eating more through stress - but yeah make sure you stay in control, enjoy your food but move around alot   Dont worry too much it is normal I'm 17 and dont know 2 many people getting their 5 a day and all that shite|`|rKFspUFvaa	maybe ur pregnant....|`|b1feaaa978d115c4f2ff497d30752baaaa	I would try this workout.

YC8X25OXaa	The injection is not very painful - like a jabbing pinch.  It's no worse than any vaccination injection, and infinitely better than having the surgery without pain relief!  It hurts enough to maybe make you wince for a moment, but the pain goes away after less than a second.    There will probably be some pain afterwards - I expect it will ache a bit for a few hours afterwards, and maybe be a little sore for a couple of days, but nothing agonising.  If you do for some reason get bad pain, your doctor will be able to give you pain relief medication.    It's definitely smart to rest it rather than go to work.  Your doctor might advise you to take more than a day off afterwards if you'll be spending 8 hours on your feet - I would think so but might be wrong, so definitely ask them.    Don't worry about it - doctor's do loads of these operations every year and it isn't a big deal.  Really, really minor, and there won't be much pain at all.  Certainly not for more than a few days.|`|7916c4d17333b435a55f05340490ade1aa	ASK THE DOCTOR TO PRENUMB BEFORE HE USES THE NEEDLE.

10b2c36737179bda3ebf63464494a884aa	You just need to continue to be the friend that you are to him. Let him vent his frustrations and fears. Maybe cook a meal for him or the family to make it easier for him. No one knows what will happen in the future or how any of us will handle it, just take it one day, one moment at a time. You sound like a really good friend to him and that is what he will need now and in the future, no matter the outcome of this situation. There is nothing you can say that will make him feel any better but, always being there as his friend and helping him take care of HIM will always make him feel a little better. I wish you the very best and applaud you for your true friendship. I will send up a prayer for you, Adrian and his mom.|`|uk0rxbVIaa	Try making him feel safe and convince him to have positive thoughts concerning his mother. It's the best way to deal with such a problem, for him and for her, as well. It's important for him to feel you by his side, even if you don't tell him nothing at all... And if she will lose the battle against the illness, try , as much as you can in due terms, to make him feel happy, try to convince him to think that his mother is fine where she is and that she had a good life. He should think of the happy moments spent with her.
3y9AlP6Raa	Put your hand in ice water.........it will reduce the swelling and numb the pain.|`|oojO4WAraa	Ice will help.  Yes, if you are in pain call the doctor.  Keep your hand elevated above the level of your heart and keep an ice pack on it.  Ice really helps with the pain and swelling.|`|LF0nwE0eaa	yes...definently...try using ice on it...may hurt, but swelling will go down...or call ur local drug dealer|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	Yes you should call and ask for some pain meds.  They know after having seen you that you are hurting, so just call them and ask, the worst that could happen is that they say no.|`|vmb4SRdIaa	Sometimes pain does become worse overnight. I would definately call the doctor and ask for some pain meds. And be more careful next time.|`|GfG6wupTaa	I LOVE pain pills and always ask for them. And sometimes I even get them!!! Never hurts to ask.

AEAxZEveaa	Do you have any other health problems or symptoms?    I had headaches and depression (among other things), and it turned out to be a sensitivity to gluten. I would suggest cutting it out for a couple days to see if that is the problem. Many people are also sensitive to dairy.    Also, have you tried to take some benadryl? Sinus headaches can linger for a long time. Try pushing on different points on your face like under your cheekbones on either sides of your nose and on your forehead. Pain in these locations is a signal that it's your sinuses.|`|AA10405438	Could be your blood pressure or something serious.  Please go to a doctor, it will put your mind at rest and maybe get rid of the headaches.
wJdCXU27aa	I am on slimquick too. Have you checked out their exercise program online? They have some really good execises for each body area. I have been on the program for 3 months and I have lost 25lbs. I am really happy with the results so far. You should write everything down that you eat and make sure your calories are coming from the right sources. If you are eating alot of carbs (bread, rice pasta) you could be bloating  and not see any weight loss. 10 days is not that long. You should give yourself a bit more time to see results. Your body may just be really good at holding onto weight. Check out the slimquick website to see exercise and diet plans. good luck-keep your chin up.|`|30f343c8a8d12fe8853bf9f8f90f049caa	it takes time to lose weight. and the slower you lose it the more you will maintain it.    cycling, swimming and walking are the best  do not rely on eating less callories  eat the right things and eat healthy|`|SuxD6qSHaa	10 days is not long enough to see results. You will start seeing results in 4 weeks to 4 months, depending on how out of shape you are.  Total calories is meaningless, portion size is the key. If you eat 5-6 small meals , its better than eating 2-3 big meals. So make sure you do that. If you are really serious about getting in shape, forget about FAST, just be patient and find out what works. And stick with it the rest of your life. If you just diet for 10 days and get slim, you will gain it back in 10 days. So slow and steady is better. Good luck!|`|haAtwu3iaa	Drink lots of water.    It takes time to lose weight, but then again everyone's different.    Try intervals.  One of my girlfriends has this walking/running routine:    walk - 10 minutes  run - 3minutes.  repeat 3x    THAT'S OVER 30 MINUTES OF EXERCISE!  and since you want to lose weight "fast"  I would consider doing this 4 times a week.    maintain a healthy diet, cut out the fast food, processed sugar/candy&sweets, dairy (try almond, rice, or soy milk), and meat will put the pounds on you to (try fish instead of beef, chicken, ham, or turkey, you can also try mock meat that's what I eat).      - hope this helped!|`|90cyv9f0aa	PLEASE... BEFORE you resort to more dangerous pills try some natural methods.    1 don't eat after 6 p.m. ... EVER!!!     2 Drink 3 liters of water a day and take a triple dose of magnesium.    this should provide immediate effects... but it cold drain you of precious energy and its dangerous for the heart so PLEASE CONSULT YOUR FAMILY DOCTOR!!!

Be careful, though, make sure your body can handle such an extreme diet change. You might end tired, with diarhhea, or some other side effect(s). Hope this helps!|`|fwpu4jL3aa	Experts recommend that you accumulate one hour of physical activity every day to stay healthy or improve our health. Obviously this is also good if you are trying to lose weight and keeping it off.    The rule is the more intensive the activity is, the shorter the duration of exercise. As you progress into activity with moderate intensity, you can cut down to 30 minutes a day for four days per week.    There are 3 types of exercise that your body needs to keep healthy - cardiovascular, flexibility and strength. Cardiovascular activities are those ranging from moderate to vigorous exercises.    Here are some of the light, moderate and vigorous activities:  http://rapidweightloss.nmaskuri.com/2008...
AA10019235	well when you throw up like that of course your body will get tired and later on you will have trouble breathing for few hours, so that should be normal.  But if it's like for a day or something then you better go to doctor.  Maybe you got some damage inside.    Good luck|`|mSt1LGfjaa	did that once when i got drunk,my stomach was so sore from puking,,when its uncontrollable like that it gets your stomach in a knot,,oh i hate that feeling,,i feel for you honey,,sure hope you get to feeling better,,you watch all that throwing up so you don't dehydrate,,drink plenty of fluids,,take care honey,and get WELL,,|`|8VlDuMFOaa	Hiya sweetie!    I would think it is a combination of being sick and having the flu which is making you feel so sore....  I am rarely sick, but the last time I was, I was the same as you...my ribs and lung area were sore for a couple of days.  I still think you should see a doctor just to be checked over to be on the safe side.....fluids and panadol hun. Hopefully that will help until you can get into seeing one.  AND, I hope you are feeling better really soon. xxxx|`|Jzrx2GeMaa	It is normal for your stomach to be very very sore after vomiting like you've described. I would ask the question why were you throwing up?    One time I got REALLY drunk and threw up all night long, even when nothing was left inside me my body was still trying to get rid of it, for 3 days after my stomach KILLED me from being so sore.|`|Y1LTzXataa	You're gonna be fine. It's just your muscles hurting. Once, when I had the flu, I vomited like you described except that it was coming out with such force that it was coming out my nose and my entire body hurt. I had a shower, brushed my teeth and slept all day|`|O5gvRj8Naa	At a guess i'd say it's a combination of sore muscles from vomiting and body aches from having the flu.|`|ZpZI15POaa	The diaphragm is the group of muscles that cause you to breathe. They probably help you vomit too, so now they're sore. I've vomited enough, I'm pretty sure I've felt the same thing when I was hung over.
MedGF3gWaa	Sounds like a small/mild case of depression.  Perhaps you should see a therapist.|`|3XWxs1ruaa	well this could be depression it sounds like the beginging of it check out other symptoms like apetite change sleeping change and other and see if u have many more signs, if u do i realllly suggest u get help talk to an adult u trust and trust me on this if it is depression, then it gets wayyy worse and u wont be anything near what u really want to be. so if this continues for a little longer then please get it checked out. ive delt with it for 1-2 years and i refused to treat it till a couple of days ago when i really just wanted to kill myself and that was alll i thought about all day and all night i even dreamt of it and planned it. by the way i started off like u but eeryone was like oh its a phase but obviously it wasnt i got put on antidepressants 4 days ago and theyre trying to get me better but i feel so hopeless now. get help before its too late. good luck hope this helped feel free to email me at any time, if u want.|`|ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	What you are describing are telltale signs of depression.  Depression can be caused by an imbalance in the chemicals that determine your mood.  When there is a chemical imbalance, there is no apparent reason for you mood - your mood is no longer controlled by your actions. So, fun things don't feel fun anymore, and nothing seems to help.      Sometimes people can kick the chemicals back into balance by becoming much more physically active through exercise and increased participation in social activities.  But this doesn't always work.      If you can't find anyway to bounce back to normal, then counseling, antidepressants, or a combination of the two might be necessary. Some people respond very well to counseling, but counseling doesn't seem to work for other.  Same thing for antidepressants.      For me, I found that antidepressants make me fell more normal - fun things feel like fun like they are supposed to, and i have a normal amount of energy and motivation to do things.  Docs tried out several different meds and i ended up finding that Wellbutrin works well for me - it has almost no side effects, and it doesn't make me feel like i am taking medications.      Talk to parents and tell them you would like to see the doc because you have had no energy lately and think something is wrong.  If you print out this question and show it to your doc, he/she will have a very good picture of what's going on and that will open up a discussion about your options for treating it.|`|vRk86MYnaa	Have a massive get-together with your friends and dine out :) Or go shopping.   While you're lying in bed, think of loads of activities to do, then pick the one that you think will make you most happy :) Like choosing what to eat off of a menu|`|EE7sAaMlaa	mild form and start of depression|`|mxtWuadraa	You know, I have exactly the same problem. I'm 15, I've never been popular, I don't get asked out to parties or spend hours on the phone to them. I've never even had a boyfriend. But I was still happy with the way I was. I've got my own gang of misfits at school and we all hang out and help each other through the good and the bad, and we all love each other for it! I used to be bullied at school, and at the time I just shrugged it off and ignored it. It didn't affect my self confidence at all. But a few months ago, when everything seemed to be going great, (I was getting straight A*'s in all my classes, my gang had never been better, my parents didn't fight, my horse was great, my dad's company was going great...) I just started to feel really low, for no reason! All of a sudden everything went bad. I'm still doing well at school, but my gang having started bitching about each other, and we've all split up. It seems like everyone hates each other, and I feel like I'm stuck in the middle. To top this off, just before christmas, my grandad died of bowel cancer, 6000 miles away. My parents had to fly over there for the funeral, and since then have not stopped arguing, about everything and anything. My dad's company has gone into administration. Everything has gone bad. I seem really really negative and it takes all i've got not to just come home and cry. My parents are constantly asking me what's wrong and i just can't say. Not because I'm ashamed or scared of telling, but because i really don't know! I don't think it's anything to do with all the bad things that have been happening, because this wierd depression thing started before that.     Anyway, there is a reason for all this rambling, and that is to let you know that you're not alone. You're not the only one that feels completely low and depressed and lethargic for apparently no reason. Maybe it's a teenage thing? Maybe it's the winter weather? Maybe it's stress? I know it takes a lot to crack a smile when you're feeling like this, but sometimes it does help. Try talking to someone you know and trust. But personally, I think it's a mixture between hormones (you just gotta hate hormones...), the cold, miserable weather, the whole credit crunch doom and glooom, and maybe stress. I know i'm stressed at the moment.. all my teachers are ranting that 'you've got your exams in 6 months and you're all going to faiiil'.. it really doesn't help.     so i hope you feel better soon and (this sounds unbelievably corny) SMILE! it helps.. honestly!!|`|izjC42rSaa	there can be a lot a change in your diet and even your period. if u r on any birthcontrol can change ur mood even vitamins can change ur mood and hormones but it sound like u really should see ur dr. try eating heathy foods and even exercise regularly can keep u balanced but really see your dr because it has been long enough u may not just snap out of it.

Min xxx|`|AH3ZEBbYaa	Sounds to me like you might have a really mild form of depression or are heading towards it.    If it really starts to interfere with your life, seek some help, it's completely normal.    However, from what you've said, it sounds like you have a case of the blues.  I know it is difficult, but reach out to your friends anyway. Push past those thoughts and invite them to hang out.  If you feel yourself feeling bad, do some activities that make you feel better- watch your favorite tv show or movie, take a jog, whatever.    It's when you don't have any activities that you enjoy that things are becoming problematic.    If you need any further help, feel free to contact me! =)|`|bqT4IIhFaa	I am currently going through the same thing. Im 17 years old, have a brand new car, boyfriend, and tons of friends. About a year ago i started to feel the same way as you. i also feel very zoned out of it. I used to be a perfect student, always motivated, wouldnt leave the house without looking perfect. Now i hardly go to school, i never do anything, and my sweat pants are pretty much glued to me.     I found a solution for my problems by finding things i love to do.  You will never be the old you, sad i know, it took me a long time to realize this. But you can either be a better old you or a worse old you.   Get out there and find something you love to do!  its not as easy as it sounds but dont give up:) you'll get there  xoxo   hope this helps    oh ps i do agree greatly with what leonard has to say. seeking help is always ok.

All you need to do is put yourself out there! Don't feel negative! Be positive about anything and everything you can!

You need to say girls i miss you .. Lets have a girly night in with a film an a pizza! Im doing that exact thing on monday night so your not alone on this one darlin! You can "fix" your life again! You don't need to but you can! If you want to then you will .. If your not that bothered then you wont .. Its all up to you darlin .. If your friends dont want to know then thats their loss!! Im sure you a totally ace person who just needs a boost! If there your real friends then you guys will be fine .. Times like this is when you realise who's gona make it to your future and whos not so dont worry darlin!  Just keep you chin up and make the most of now!     Good luck with that if any of it helps! And sorry if it doesnt :)|`|cJsxRgxzaa	You don't say why you grew apart from your friends..  There really must be some point that you made the decision that what was going on in your life (your friends) was not quite what you wanted..  Think back, try to find that place when you thought you may have moved beyond that "bubbly fun time", a time when you began to realise that, perhaps you needed more..    It really could be you have just "grown up" sooner than your friends.  If this is the case, then perhaps it is your hormones taking over your body  when, in reality, your mind is not quiet ready for these changes..  You are only 16, you are missing all that fun, all the "silly" things we do at that age. You miss that total enjoyment where we feel no responsibility for our "fun"...    We all go through these feelings when we eventually move from adolescence to becoming an "adult"..    If this is what is happening to you then you should talk to someone about your feelings..  Perhaps someone at your school, they should be well informed to note the difference from life change, or depression..  Either way to talk will help you.    Whatever is causing you to feel this way, please remember, it will help to talk...    You are not being negative, what you feel is real for you..  Don't leave things to get worse..  Talk with someone now..  Only good can come from talking..    I wish you well my friend...|`|jYeiDofgaa	This same thing happened to me, and I know it can be really hard. There are several things I can suggest doing, firstly, see a doctor, they will be able to find the problem, most likely depression. Secondly, see a counsellor, it can really help to just talk to someone without feeling judged. They may even be able to help you find solutions to problems. Thirdly, suicide is definitely the answer. I'd try cutting your neck and if that fails use google to work out how to make a noose.
de29070765c097b8f505a737e52df5bfaa	The worst period in quitting smoking is the first twenty-four hours. After 28 days the receptors in your brain start naturally producing the chemical you were artificially introducing by smoking. After that it is just a matter of not falling off the wagon.<br>  <br>  I lost weight while quitting by eating properly...... i.e. healthy choices and frequently. Working out will also help, but you are going to find that your lung capacity is really diminished. Expect to endure a smoker's hacking cough after really exerting yourself with a physical workout.<br>  <br>  Why not enlist the aid of your doctor? They now have help for you that will lesson the impact of nicotine withdrawal. Also he can advise you on the proper diet to help lose weight in the process.|`|s072WzNDaa	I'm a long-time smoker as well and the last time I tried quitting I gained 25 lbs. Unfortunately I started smoking again, but I also decided to lead a more active lifestyle. I workout at least three days a week doing a minimum of 30-minutes of cardio and some weight training. <br>  <br>  That was three years ago and I have lost all the weight and then some. As a smoker it was very difficult for me at first, particularly the cardio. I could barely run a mile in 30-minutes, but now I can run four miles in 30-minutes and I'm in better shape than many non-smokers my age who lead a sedentary lifestyle.<br>  <br>  Granted, if I didn't smoke I'd probably be in even better shape. It's just so difficult for me to give something up that, sad as this sounds, I still enjoy. Probably the toughest part is overcoming the guilt when I step outside the gym and light up a cigarette after working out.|`|JDE6aiX8aa	The key for losing weight is not difficult - eat less food and workout more often - the issues surface when we in reality try to put that into practice! There are loads of temptations out there aren't there?! The one method which really worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a handful of free trials left, it has been reported in Fox News and CNN. I lost 25 pounds, it really does produce success!
67ea71af780ce95553f2ddb1eddee690aa	Leukemia is the first (and only) one that comes to mind immediately that is blood borne, affects immunity and has a higher incidence rate among children and teens. I'm sure there are others but leukemia is most prevalent.    Most cancers or encapsulated tumors aren't immune system killers in of themselves, it's the chemotherapy and radiation treatments that destroy the immune systems of cancer patients.    As far as "adult" cancers, I would think melanoma, prostate, colon and breast cancer are predominant in older people even though on rare occasion children can get these as well.|`|iqGaNZTtaa	AIDS, caused by the human IMMUNODEFICIENCY virus, and the leukemias, are the major culprits.
qy7C8Ybvaa	well you are not fat so you don't have much to worry about. try eating meals instead of snacking all day. balanced meals; like for dinner try to incorporate protein (chicken, tofu) starch (potato, rice) and veggie (peas) and some fruit or something. than in the night you can snack on those chocolate crisps if you want but the dinner might fill you up. for breakfast try cereal and milk - or yogurt and granola with fruit. pancakes are a good switch- up. hope it helps :)
JrCaPAYIaa	My honest answer is wait... sex is sacred and you should totally wait until you are married. You may regret doing it later.. I slept with the first boyfriend I had.. granted I was in my twenties but we split later and I totally regretted it.. Just make sure if you are going to do it you fully trust each other and are sure its the right thing. As far as the answer goes.. it depends on the person.. it may hurt for her a little but it gets easier with time. Just don't freak if you see blood.. just means you popped her cherry.. though I've heard some girls don't bleed or bleed as much.. just depends on the person. Good luck.|`|Ws1qOP1Haa	both just use a condom and take it slow|`|a8c3721d218891d4a3fb70f51dc29b23aa	it hurts but it's pleasurable|`|SbK0Ojqlaa	It will hurt a little and there might be a small amount of blood, but don't worry its normal and it will be MUCH better each time you do it!  have fun   kx|`|nAvvthR1aa	Yes it usally does hurt a bit. it depends on the women though some say it doesnt hurt at all some say it was horrible. It might depend on the size of the guy also. To make it not hust as much make sure you are fully aroused (wet) and there is enough foreplay beforehand. Also use a lubricated condom and you can even put extra lube on it. Make sure your first is with someone special though its something you can never get back and you will always remember it so make it someone worth remembering!|`|AA11689113	Look the first time for me was very painful. I did not enjoy it what so ever as a matter of fact i wanted it to be over as soon as possible. I'm not saying that this is how it's for every one.  And as you mentioned you are only 16 you still got plenty of time to do this. Also make sure your girlfriend wants to do it for her self and not just because she wants to give you what she thinks you want. And listen I'm not just preaching or telling you whats socially approved. I waited till i was 21 to have sex. And i do not regret it!!!!!!!!!!!|`|3pFOHj8Oaa	It should hurt a little - unless you have a really small ****.|`|ee3mDKNDaa	yes it is go for it, u wont have anything to worry about, make sure that hes wearing a condomn and ur doing it secretly|`|5c571c4f67e0847c52fdcad82da07aa2aa	Yes it hurts, no it's no pleasurable.

dpgXzMenaa	*NEVER* douche unless your doctor prescribes it, and only use the product that (s)he's prescribed.<br>  <br>  Douching can change the chemical balance in your vagina and vulva and reduce or even eliminate the bacteria and other critters that are there to keep your genitals healthy by *protecting* them against their unhealthy competitors, and that can leave you open to all sorts of different infections.<br>  <br>  All you need to wash is lots of water and a little mild soap... and don't try to wash anything you can't feel from the outside. It's OK for soap to get inside the lips of your vulva as long as you rinse it away, but *don't* put any inside your vagina.<br>  <br>  <br>  Two things will make you wet "down there"... both are normal and healthy, they both have a scent, and they're *supposed* to happen.<br>  <br>  1) Your genitals keep themselves clean and healthy by sort of "rinsing" themselves with the fluids that they make (this will happen constantly beginning in early puberty, 24/7 for the rest of your life, but you won't always notice it)... sometimes there's quite a bit of fluid and it can leak out a *lot*, so wearing panty liners or even light pads can be a good thing to help keep your clothes clean.<br>  <br>  2) When your body is aroused sexually ("turned on" or "horny", even if you're not doing or thinking anything sexual) your genitals will get wetter and slipperier... sometimes very, *very* wet... so that a penis can slide in there comfortably if you have sex like it's telling you it wants (you don't have to, of course).<br>  <br>  I'm a cook, so the only things I can really compare the healthy scent of a vagina/vulva to are foods and such... and the nearest I can think of is a fairly mild combination of fresh oysters and grated truffles (the savory mushrooms, not the sweet chocolates) - musky and usually more on the sea-like side, but not "fishy" and certainly not unpleasant.<br>  <br>  It often smells stronger when you're sexually aroused or when you're sweaty after exercise or have spent most of a day in tight pants or clinging underwear, but not always... and it tastes much like it smells, but it's a little bit salty and less sweet than the scent suggests. (Don't be afraid to taste: it can give you info that your eyes and nose - even your *doctor* - can't provide you with, in addition to the fact that it's probable your boyfriend(s) and/or husband(s) are gonna do that anyhow if they have any brains... and it's sure not gonna hurt *them*.)<br>  <br>  If this "discharge" is clear or slightly milky (might be tinted faintly yellow or brown), slippery to maybe a little sticky or stretchy, and smells "earthy, animal and a little like the ocean", it's almost certainly healthy and good. If it smells truly fishy or otherwise bad, especially if it itches or feels irritated, then it's probably an infection and you should see a doc.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Douching will only make that discharge even worse.<br>  You should probably go to the gyno, to make sure it's nothing serious.<br>  But it's probably a yeast infection, in which case they make creams for that.|`|imofYcOHaa	If it smells bad and is not white then it may be an infection, you should see your doctor,and you can also wear a thin pad so it doesn't feel uncomfortable
pMjFLRCRaa	Your friend did something very stupid and may have serious medical problems if they don't see a doctor.  She's really quite lucky because there was a good chance of death in a 14 year old girl with a dose like that.       The other person who replied is right, there is a good chance of liver problems.  Actually, however, the chance of renal (kidney) failure is even greater.  Something like 10-20% of people on chronic dialysis are undergoing treatment because of acetaminophen toxicity.      Just because your friend isn't dead doesn't mean she's out of the woods.  If she's too dumb to tell her parents, you tell them;  if you're a good friend, you won't worry about her getting in trouble and instead worry about her safety.  The more time that passes, the harder it is to fix the problem.|`|xJZSpsRhaa	She also could have a heart attack.  Excedrin speeds up the heart and flow.  If it goes to fast then she could go into cardiac arrest (heart attack).  Her body is rejecting the pills by her puking.  This is a good thing.  But, it may not be enough.  I agree with the other posters.  You should tell your parents to tell her parents, or you tell her parents.  Its a VERY VERY SERIOUS problem!      If it ruins your friend ship with this girl, then you know what, at least you can hold your head high thinking that you saved someones life.  If you don't, you could have a cloud hanging over yours after she passes, knowing that you could've helped.      DO IT NOW!    Hope this Helps!|`|HdmD1QLZaa	That'd really thin the blood. She needs to tell her parents and now! Get to the hospital.This is nothing to play with. If she won't say, you should, your friend may be mad at you,but later she should realize that you were only trying to help save her life.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	Excedrin is asprin and acetamenophen with caffeine and she is lucky she did not bleed to death.  The dizzyness is from low blood pressure, probably because of the thinning of her blood. By now many of the immediete effects will subside but she may have long term damage to her liver and kidneys.  You know, you could tell her parents.|`|GwQoeHK4aa	Some times to be a true friend you must risk the friendship.  Tell her parents immediately (even if she tells you not to or tells you that she is feeling better).  She needs emergency care to reduce the chance of permanent injury (although it is too late to administer the antidote for acetaminophen).  Believe me when I say that I am not exaggerating: this is incredibly serious.      A close friend of mine who is a nurse practitioner who worked in an emergency room once told me that however my life turned out, never take too much acetaminophen (even if my goal was trying to kill myself).  She had seen three people who took whole bottles of acetaminophen and none of them lived.  They each wanted to commit suicide, were initially very sick at home, felt slightly better physically, and realized perhaps they didn't want to die. The next day they felt worse again and went to the hospital to find out that they had organ failure and then they died in extreme pain.      Since your friend has already lived a few days and Excedrin has less acetaminophen than Tylenol alone, she will probably be okay if she seeks medical attention immediately.    You are a good friend for caring so much about her and she will thank you someday.|`|AA11898576	I am very surprised her Funeral was not yesterday. She could develop post liver problems taking that many. Is she trying suicide...

Because this could be a danger to you, and possible others around you.<br>  <br>  Don't worry though, I'm sure it's treatable if it ends up being a type of "disorder".

AA12350771	When you work your chest, your triceps are the secondary muscles involved, so when you do things like chest press, you're building both your pecs and your triceps. In terms of other exercises, you can do variations of press ups, such as making a diamond shape with your hands and doing a close grip press up, or putting your grip much wider and doing wide press ups. You can rest one hand on a medicine ball and do press ups that way, and if you're feeling really brave, you can put your hands in front of your head and try and do press ups that way (although they are really really hard!). Check the first link below for some video suggestions.<br>  <br>  If you want something more localised to your triceps rather than press ups, you can do dips. If you have any weights, rest them on your lap as you do the repititions. Check the second link below for more explanation.|`|ARmhMq5laa	get some barbells and lay on your back and push them up and down..you can put them together too while laying down and put them behind your head then back in front of chest and repeat. <br>  you can curl the barbells and lift them out to your side like a T over and over..you can even punch with them that works good too.<br>  <br>  you can do a lot of things with barbells i would recommend squats and tummy exercises to make sure you have an even tone all over.

AfGfGSsTaa	Well hair loss can occur with women just as it does for men even when all are healthy according to both allopathic & naturopathic guidelines; so there is not always a specific health problem as such that is the cause of hair loss other than pure genetics that allow it to happen in the first place (which is evolution, hard written code that cannot be changed - Simply something we have to live with such as skin colour and height etc).<br>  <br>  More often than not when a woman is starting to lose hair (especially at an early age) it's vitally important to look at her liver as that is most likely to be needing attention.<br>  <br>  Second to that Stress is something else; if you consider that you have a stress level that is more than you'd consider to be the every day average... try doing something each day that takes your mind off things... whether it's exercise, something you truly love or just spending time chilling out etc... believe it or not but this greatly decreases stress levels.<br>  <br>  Stress is a major player in the disfunction of the body.<br>  <br>  A diet high in sugar, saturated fats, salt, dairy, alcohol, caffeine, drugs (both prescription & over the counter), artificial colours, flavours & preservatives are definitely things that will pollute the liver thus greatly reduce it's function.<br>  <br>  Garlic is great for it's sulphur content, Ginger greatly increases circulation to the surface of your skin (aka scalp); Feel free to include these into meals liberally each day.<br>  <br>  A liver cleanse you can have daily is equal parts Carrot, Celery & Beetroot juiced.|`|tNpnd7k1aa	Silica supplements are good, however they can cause kidney and liver problems if taken in too high a potency!

Well, you are not alone. This is because the patterns are not really recognizable unlike that with men.<br>  <br>  Women should not really be scared when they notice their hair thinning because it may be because of some illness or pregnancy that they experience this. If you judge the pattern like with men, you should remember that a man’s hair begins to thin earlier than a woman. Women start hair loss at around 50, or even later.  <br>  <br>  But if you are really the kind of woman who fears that the hair loss you are experiencing is not normal, you should probably see a specialist to have an early diagnosis. It is recommended to see a specialist rather than doing a self exam because often times, self diagnosis is not accurate. <br>  <br>  As discussed earlier, women do not shed hair like men, which have an obvious thinning of hair as they have a different hair loss pattern.There are different patterns that may consider as signs of “Androgenetic Alopecia”. If you see your hair thinning by the back and front of the scalp, it may suggest that you have Androgenetic Alopecia. <br>  <br>  Also, when the entire scalp seems to be thinning, well it is an obvious sign of the Androgenetic Alopecia.Though it has been discussed that female pattern starts at 50, it may also be that it starts on the late teen years to the early 20s of women. That is why you have to see a specialist to diagnose the thinning. <br>  <br>  There are also a few causes of hair loss in women that is not associated with the hair loss pattern. These include Trichotillomania, which is caused by hair pulling. Alopecia areata which may be a disorder that autoimmune. <br>  <br>  Triangular alopecia which is only a temporary loss. Scarring Alopecia, which involves the scarring of the area of the scalp. And lastly, Telogen effluvium, which is a hormonal or drug/stress associated cause.For more information visit the link in the source<br>  <br>  Good luck ;)|`|421b2fb60081b51b56d2f694ad49b8ceaa	Hello, your in luck.

0a7a0027e0ce28f6f9d73ee5c3610710aa	On this account you not unhealthy at all.You are a healthy and fit person.During normal breathing,the air we take is first warmed and moistened by the nasal passage.People tend to breath through their mouths, when they exercise and they are inhaling colder and drier air.The muscle bands around the airways are sensitive to these changes in temperature and humidity and react by constricting which narrows the airways.While exercising,this results in Tightening of chest,wheezing,Unusual fatigue and shortning of breath.These symptoms begin usually within 5-20 minutes of starting the exercise.1 out of 4-5 athlets even at olympics level have this problem,some of the famous names being: Jackie Joyner-Kerse--track & field,Jerome Bettis--NFL running back,Amy Van Dyken--swimming,Dennis Rodman--NBA basketball,and Ray Bourque--NHL hockey.Breathing through nose,warming up properly before and cooling down after exercise,can help to control it in addition to use of bronchodilators taken half an hour before exercise.|`|8Ld9Dmgeaa	sometimes i have this issue too. i have some athletically induced asthma and my doctor prescribed an inhaler that i hate using since it's chalked full of steroids. i am not super fit but im not fat and overweight either. it doesn't mean that your unhealthy, it just means you might have a slight case of asthma. <br>  <br>  hope i helped.

It impacts your mood, sleep,work performance and  and your general health.Consult your doctor first.<br>  If you have had this pain for less than a few weeks, it is usually considered acute. If your back pain has lasted longer than 3 months, it is considered chronic. Acute back pain usually goes away on its own,but if it has lasted 3 days or more, you should go to the doctor. Back pain or any pain is a symptom that something is wrong, and should not be ignored. Also, the location of the pain is important in determining its cause. In the mean time, pay attention to your posture, use proper body mechanics in bending and lifting. Try using alternating cold and warm moist compresses (for a cold compress use a bag of frozen green peas, for warm compress, use a wet warm towel, about 15 minutes for each). Never apply ice or direct heat to the skin as it can cause tissue damage. Talk to your doctor about exercise and strengthening exercises. Also check with the doctor about using over the counter remedies. Hope you feel better soon.

k3VX8VMXaa	I had 2 teeth out when I was like 11 because of cavities and I was so scared. I cried and cried at the dentist office and got so worked up but it didn't hurt.  It was just scary having them pulling at stuff in your mouth but the Novocain really does work.  I thought I was feeling pain at first but it was just pressure, and it was over pretty quick.  Then just last year I had to have 2 more teeth out to get braces.  I am 23 and so I thought "oh I've been through this already, I know it will be fine, and I'm much older now so I can handle it."  I took my husband with me for moral support and I was completely calm up until they told me my husband couldn't be in the room with me while I had it done.  Then out of nowhere I started hyperventilating and crying and I didn't even know why.  I must have been more scared than I let myself believe... any way, of course all my carrying on had been for no reason because just like last time, everything went fine.  It was over really fast and didn't hurt at all.  The worst part is afterwards when you want to eat but have to worry about not displacing the blood clot that forms.      Just know that this is something that sooo many people go through all the time and yes it's a little scary but it's not bad at all and it's over very fast.  I think it would have really helped me if they would have just let my husband stay in the room with me but they said it was for his own protection.  Apparently one person at the place I went to had fainted so they don't let friends or relatives in the room during the procedure anymore, but they never told me he couldnt be there til the last minute...    Anyway just make sure you take good care of the extraction sites and don't dislodge the blood clots or you could get dry socket which is painful.  I worried about this a lot but they stay in place pretty well so you'll be fine.  You will see it is all worth it once you get your braces on and start seeing the progress your teeth are making towards looking nice and straight!  Good luck :-)|`|rbcb5S1Kaa	im not gunna lie.  it does hurt!|`|7bQUBYeNaa	It doesnt hurt. I had 1 pulled for my braces too. Ive had 7 removed in total. The worst part is the anestesia.

I think you need to have insurance to go private but check it out put it in to google it will also have details of private hospitals on the NHS website.   Britain has one of the best medical services in the world, that's why we pay taxes, so you are entitled to see a doctor.|`|ed1fd474ffe907b183e2991c2f9b248daa	This really is something to take to your local doctor. I suggest  you phone them again and tell her firmly that you have been ill for several weeks and this is not getting better, you are afraid you may now have a chest infection and possibly need antibiotics. You could tell her that you appreciate that its her job to filter out unnecessary patient visits, but you have waited a long time and are still not better. You are afraid that you could develop pneumonia. (if you really do think its that severe)
7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	No.  There are so many no's in your question.  You would not know the day after if you were pregnant.  Could have had something to do with the morning after pill you took  And maybe its what you ate?  Cause that sounds pretty fatty and gross.  And also...pre-*** (unless there was ejaculate without urination before) does not contain sperm    EDIT - Trust me on this.  You would not know the next day if you were preggers.  There is no hormone increase or anything the day after.|`|AA11311675	The morning after pill has some ulgy side effects like vomiting, besides you cant be getting pregnancy symptoms a day after you have sex|`|OvtaxdBkaa	it was probably just from what you ate.

Foods with a higher Glycemic index value will tend to be absorbed quicker, while lower Glycemic index foods take a lot more time to get absorbed.    So get a book on th Glycemic Index.  Also you might want to look at these two books.  Dr. Barnard's Program for Reversing Diabetes.    The PH Miracle for Diabetes, by Dr. Young.  In this book, Dr. Young writes that insulin is mush less effective once the body is to toxic with over acidity condition, and that eating a alkaline lifestyle is a key to living better, and once the sugars are reduced, then medications can be adjusted to lower levels as well.

Tell her that a low-carbohydrate diet is best for controlling blood glucose.    Avoid foods like rice, potatoes, bread, pasta, flour, and all desserts with sugar. The nutrition facts on the side of boxes will tell her how many carbohydrates there are and how many of those carbs are from sugar.|`|FKhWEd5kaa	You need to look at the carbohydrate count instead of focusing directly on sugar.

Inhaling exhaust fumes isn't good for you.  But, now you are breathing clean air and your body will get oxygen.  You will be okay.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	No, 25 minutes is plenty of time. Covering your mouth with a shirt will stop some of what makes exhaust smell nasty but carbon monoxide is a very small molecule. Your body is probably full of damaged hemoglobin right now which is why you do not feel well.    If you go to a hospital they can give you oxygen, but it's probably not necessary at this point. Don't do it again.    Call a tow truck next time.

But if you truly don't need glasses then you should get a refund on the glasses. But I noticed that one person stated there really is no difference between perfect and a -0.5 and I know there is a huge difference. I wear -0.25 and I know there is a huge difference when I wear my glasses and when I don't. The big test is when you put on the glasses do you see better...if you do then you probably need the glasses if they don't help at all go talk to the office. If you are not satisfied contact Better Business Bureau or file a small claims.|`|C5aYxbAjaa	Different optometrist will sometimes get different results from the refraction test, hence the difference in your prescriptions of -0.5 and none.  And yes, -0.5 is a big difference to 0.   I think most optical stores should have a refund policy considering yours is a special case. And if its only been purchased recently.  Try to talk to the manager again and he might give you a refund.  I think they should as they have been around for quite a while.|`|6ce30766a545694d9f60976802874a8baa	File and bring it to small claims court. Bring your receipts for what you paid at the first place, your prescription that he said you had, and also get a writeup from the second optical doctor stating that your eyesight is fine and that you don't need a prescription. The only problem I for see happening is that there really is no difference between -.5 and perfect. So they may say it is one doctors opinion versus another.

9QyrW2iCaa	In recent years, the lower retainer seems to be a permanent fixture on most people after they have braces.  I recommend going to an orthodontist and have it repaired.  I wish I had had a permanent retainer placed after my braces because my lower teeth shifted.  If you like straight teeth and your retainer wasn't causing you any severe discomfort I recommend getting it repaired soon.  Take care and good luck to you and your smile!  : )|`|wTMMG0enaa	you should definitely get it repaired, and wearing a retainer shouldn't take too long. i had a retainer at age 12 for 1 year then braces for like 5-6-??? years and now that mine are off i have to wear retainers (top clear, bottom metal) for a month or two. anytime your retainer or whatever breaks like that and causes any discomfort you should immediately get it repaired.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	Your ortho will tell you when it's time to take it off.  It's usually only a year or two.  Haven't you been in since you got your braces off?  If you take it off before your teeth are ready they will move, which not only wastes the money for your braces, but it can hurt a LOT if your teeth start to crowd.    You should also probably take your retainers out to eat, and that won't happen.  I rarely took mine out to eat either, but my bottom broke, too. :P|`|JKkkBuhSaa	ask your dentist   but cant you take your retainor out when you eat?  thats what i do?|`|zTT3MZk8aa	the bottom retainer is forever, I got my braces when I was 14 and I still have it...

(yes, it was supposed to be permanent) It came off as soon as i got home that day. My ortho then gave me one that i could take on and off. Needless to say, I lost the sucker, and i rarely wear my top retainer and my teeth are still pretty perfect. I'm sure everyone is different so you should check with your ortho.|`|5113da5f5f2db1b7c09fc008f88315bfaa	My sons wear theirs only at night after the first 6 months. They do not eat with it in.  You might want to call your orthodontist and ask their recommendations as they know best.    Good luck!

b1feaaa978d115c4f2ff497d30752baaaa	I would try this workout. At the same time you will be gaining muscule and burning fat. So its awesome.       WHAT YOU'LL NEED: Two 5 pounds weights.  * means one 5 pound weight in each hand.    If you don't have two 5 pound weights try using water bottles full of water.      Workout:  Stretch  *20 Bench Press x3   20 squats x3  *20 side arm lifts x3  20 crunches x3  20 push-ups x3  *20 lunges x3  20 leg lifts x3  Walk for 30 mins  Stretch    Stretching before your workout helps you not to pull a muscule during your workout.    Stretching after your workout helps you not be AS sore afterward.     I try to do this everyday, but I'm sure you would get results doing this only 2-4 days a week. I recomend everyday.      Eat 1500 calories a day and drink 8 glasses of water daily.    You will lose weight and tone up!      I've lost 6 pounds and I've only been doing it for a week!      You can do it! i know you can!    You will be sore. and it will hurt but you can do it.    Don't be scared to add more excercises of more reps.      Hope this works for you!|`|OwAE70I5aa	yes cause your burning calories|`|lb8FBhWnaa	yes, that will work.

Try to break your food intake on calories.   Eat raw veggies and oatmeal. Smaller portions in the evening as well. Try to eat healthy.     Working out to jump start your metabolism is key.     Work out in the morning around 430 am to begin your calorie work out for 1hour. Hydrate the day before. Do high impact cardio.    In the evening do some strength training with cardio work outs for about 2hours. Sit with a fitness trainer and develop a program to me the needs that make your goals attainable.

And keeps my lungs safe from tar and other chemicals :)

2sycPf8Daa	Recovering from a stroke can be mentally exhausting. In addition to the various physical side effects, feelings of helplessness, frustration, depression and apathy aren't unusual. Diminished sex drive and mood changes also are common.     How quickly you recover from a stroke depends on the extent of damage to your brain, and the intensity and duration of the therapy you receive. But your recovery also is likely to be influenced by your personality, life experiences and coping styles. Your own motivation to recover is a key factor in obtaining an optimal level of rehabilitation.     Changes in personality following a Stroke may be rare but often very disturbing to the family. Personality is the unique combination of an individuals thoughts, feelings and reactions toward themselves, others and their environment. After a Stroke some may not seem the same person as before. The way in which they think, feel and react may be altered. Family and relatives need to understand the new and puzzling changes. Problems and activities once tackled easily may be difficult or impossible, while other tasks are unaffected. People may become confused, self-centred, uncooperative and irritable, and may have rapid changes in mood. They may not be able to adjust easily to anything new and may become anxious, annoyed or tearful over seemingly small matters.    If someone close to you has had a stroke, you can help by offering companionship and support. Address a stroke survivor directly and don't talk down to him/her. Treat him/her just as you did before the stroke. Because someone has had a stroke doesn't mean he or she can't think anymore.     Although stroke-related disabilities can be permanent, many people lead active lives after a stroke. Many are able to resume everyday life and responsibilities.     Take care as always!|`|ieCuJVZtaa	It completely depends upon where in the brain the stroke happened. There are one of two types-- one where there is a lack of oxygen in certain parts of the brain, and the other is when it accumulates in grossly high proportions (a hemorrhage).    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke    Read up and scroll down... if parts of the brain dealing with emotion are affected, a person's personality is certainly going to be altered.
iZk9jEBpaa	It could be a number of things, some serious some harmless. It may be that allergies are irritating your nose, other things are broken blood vessels and on the more serious scale it could be things like leukemia or a brain tumor.

qm6jJjoOaa	Its hard to find a good friend these days. Well, one that actually cares deeply about you. I think those who do are lucky.    Its seems as though the reason to why you cant make friends is because of the way people perceive you, which sucks i know, but people will pre-judge no matter if it is imoral. Thats just the way the world is, and this world is a *****.     If you are a negative person, people are usually put off by this, as its easier to ignore and forget about, rather than care enough to ask whats bothering you.     Its exactly why people say "yeah im fine" when asked how they are, because its much easier to say that than go into how much your really hurting inside. Usually the ones that ask are looking for this easy answer any way cause they couldnt give a **** either way. Many people want to be 'normal' while very few want to be themselves.    Depression will only get worse without help, which you probably already know. But there is this cheaper alternative for treating depression, which you might of heard of. Its a herbal remedy called "St Johns Wort"     Scientists have found it is just as effective as Prozac at treating depression.     Keeping in mind that depression can be a chemical imbalance in the brain, St Johns Wort contains plant extracts called hypericum perforatum which helps lift depression and its effects.    It is relatively cheap and available without prescription, so really is worth looking into, and is a safer and natural remedy for treating depression, rather than stronger acid based medicenes.     It may, or may not be benificial to you, but its at least worth a try.     Im sorry you feel the way you do, i really do. Depression is a f**king terrible thing to go through, i know. But you just have to get on with life. You need to WANT to help yourself, because sometimes its quite comfortable being depressed, its kind of like something you can blame everything you do/feel on easily if that makes sence.     If you do want to find people that will make you happy, you need to be willing to do some of the work, cause for most people, they wont just find you.|`|FtBHXQvHaa	lighten up ,life too short to be a hater you shouldn't be so hateful towards everything ,you should enjoy life while your still young,get your happy face on, be more  friendly to people around you you might think about starting some relationships , i hope this helps a little.. good luck|`|d34NoSGhaa	You have definitely given up.

nAvvthR1aa	If you miss a pill you are supposed to take it as soon as you remember so you would take two pills in one day. If she forgot to take the pill competly and the sex was unprotected then she should get Plan B pill if she still can. It is effective up to 72 hours after sex. If she just forgot the pill and wore a condom she should be fine but tell her to wear a condom for a week following the missed pill just to be safe. One pill should not do anything but it is best to be on the safe side and if she has missed more than just that one before i was highly recommend the plan B pill if it has been within 72 hours. You can but it at almost any pharmacy.

5GeYfHrmaa	A huge number of people have HPV.  Only 4 strains cause cancer.  Basically, when they detect it there is nothing they can do.  They just test you once every 6 months to a year to see if it's causing problems.  They wouldn't need a followup because there is no "official" treatment for it.  It's no big deal, actually most people carry it after college.  It doesn't have to cause warts or cancer and I've talked to GYNs with a lot of experience that says HPV never usually results in ANYTHING as long as a woman keeps her immune system up.     It's a virus that lays dormant in most people.  Tell your mom not to worry and to take natural, anti viral immune boosters like natural vitamin C to keep it dormant.|`|AEAxZEveaa	Many people have HPV, there's no cure for it, and it usually doesn't even cause symptoms.

Cells go though different stages before they become full blown cancer cells. Goal of the pap smear is to detect the cells that are in "pre-cancerous" stage. This has been standard practice for last two decades and helped reduce death and suffering associated with cervical cancer.    Scientist have now tried to find why cervical cells become cancerous. One of the direct link found is infection with HPV. Once women become sexually active HPV infection becomes more prevelant. HPV infection in turn in some women results into cells becoming  pre-cancerous and then full blown cancer cells. Now it does not happen in all women and we dont have way to tell which one will.    Modern medicine combines traditional PAP smear with sophisticated molecular DNA amplification test to see if HPV infection exist. In your mother's case, it does but there is no abnormal PAP smear. Also only certain HPV types (two out of ~50) are associated srongly with cancer. I dont think test is specific for certain type but I may be wrong. Doctor has reason to believe your mom should be closely monitored and therefore repeat PAP smear in a year.     I am not sure if this is standard practice and we have found enough evidence to support such practice. Nonetheless, I have no reason to believe it will harm your mom's health. So just go on with your life as usual and go back for test next year.

kXq90b09aa	Hi<br>   you know what, your diet plan seems too harsh on you, its way too formal and sounds very restrictive. if you know your calorie allowance, eat less than that and you will lose weight. You can eat anything like fats, carbs within set target, however eat good carbs and good fats and lots of veggies and fruits for optimum results.  <br>  <br>  whatever your calorie allowance is, eat 500 calories less a day, this way you will lose a pound a week (3500 calories = 1 pound). if you want to lose more, eat a lil bit less and exercise, however do not eat less than 1200 calories a day. Do cardio (30 mins jogging or 1 hour brisk walking at least 4 times a week, you will lose apprx 400 calories each session) <br>  <br>  Start weights once you lose few pounds, that will build and strengthen your muscles, the more muscles you have, higher your metabolic rate will be, thus you burn more calories.<br>  <br>  Also start interval training after 1 month of continous cardio, which is a far better way to burn fat, but since this involve high intense exercises, you have to be fitter than what you are now.|`|vEHP8JySaa	i think this is what you are looking for|`|4BFbfE70aa	Eating every 2 to 3 hours does help you lose weight because, every time you eat your metabolism spikes in order to actually break down and digest the food. In addition to that, if you get your body used to eating every 2-3 hours it "knows" that you will feed it, so it doesn't try to hold on to the calories you consume because it is afraid of starvation, so it begins the process of metabolizing and getting the nutrients you need to the proper places in the body. With all of that being said...your meal plan needs a little work. <br>  <br>  You need to aim to consume about 1,500 calories a day, but no less than 1,200 (because then your body enters starvation mode and your metabolism slows down...which is not good at all). <br>  <br>  You need to include lean protein, carbohydrates (mostly of the whole grain, and fiber rich sources), fruits, and vegetables. You need some fat but try to limit it to the good, heart healthy fats (omega 3 and 6 fatty acids...think cold water fish, and nuts). Try to eat 5 to 6 times a day, and try to include lean protein in all of your meals. And drink plenty of water. <br>  <br>  Here's what a sample day of your eating plan should look like<br>  <br>  Breakfast: Oatmeal, 2 egg whites, fruit, and a slice of whole wheat toast<br>  Snack: 1/2 protein bar (or a whole bar if it has less than 10 grams of protein) and a fruit or a nonfat yogurt and a fruit.<br>  Lunch: 1 cup of rice, 3 oz chicken breast, and a veggie<br>  Snack: same as the earlier snack<br>  Dinner: 1 cup of rice, 3oz fish, and a veggie<br>  <br>  Basically, all of your meals should contain a source of protein, and carbohydrate. Include veggies with lunch and dinner, and fruit with breakfast and snacks. Watch your portion sizes (no more than the size of your fist for each food). Eat fresh or frozen fruits or veggies (not canned), and cook all your meats by baking, roasting, broiling, steaming, or grilling...try to limit your intake of fried food. And try to get at least 1 TBSP of olive oil a day (use it to cook with). <br>  <br>  Also EXERCISE is key! Try to include at least 30 minutes of physical activity 4 to 5 days a week, and include strength training exercises.  It helps rev your metabolism and build lean muscle mass. Each pound of muscle burns 50 calories at rest. If you gain 10 pounds of muscle, you can burn 500 calories just lying around doing nothing. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your weight loss goals!
vQVAZM66aa	Gaining weight actually doesn't mean you grew fatter. I guess 28 pounds is a lot but from what i know, gaining weight when /after working out is absolutely normal. It's the waistline you gotta watch out for, if it widened up a bit, you better get working.

4BFbfE70aa	You have got to modify your caloric intake. Decrease it by 500 calories a day and you will lose 1 pound a week because 3500 calories = 1 pound. If you want to expedite your weight loss progress, you should also try to burn at least 500 during your workout sessions. <br>  <br>  If you can, do something besides riding the bicycle. The body gets efficient when it becomes accustomed to performing the routine. Because of this, the body doesn't work as hard to do the work...so you are probably burning less calories than the number you see showing up on the calorie counter of the machine. <br>  <br>  Variety is the spice of life...and this applies to your workout routine. If you only like the bike, and are not used to using any other cardio machine, use different programs on the bike, or work at intervals. Alternate 1 minute of intense spikes during your workout (increase the resistance or increase your speed), then return to normal for 2 minutes and repeat. <br>  <br>  Challenge your body, and you'll see results!

Y4s4Om38aa	You have to be able to prove that it is bad enough that you can not hold a job, and have a psychiatrist to support that.  Also, many people find that getting a layer or advocate helps.  Still may have to try many times to get approved.<br>  <br>  However, if you can work, you should, just having bipolar and adhd is not a simple ticket to getting SSI because many of us are capable of fuctioning just fine and holding a job with proper treatment.  If you truely cant, do be aware you will be looked at very scepticly because of how many people do try to milk the system, and use something as bipolar as an exucuse to not have to work when  they really can.<br>  <br>  For people making the lazy comments, yes some people do use it as an excuse to be lazy, and i cant stand that because I have bipolar and have been working full time since i was 17....8 years with one company, left there on good terms for a better job that i am going on 2 years at.  However, sometimes bipolar IS severe enough to prevent someone from being able to hold a stable fulltime job.  And its not as simple as "take you meds and get a job".   Sometimes it takes quite a while to find the meds that work.......if its even possible to find meds that work at all......some people never even do.   Also, many people only need be on SSI for a relitivly short time until they can get themselfs straightned out enought to be able to hold a job.  Being awfully judgemental to assume that someone is just being lazy from a single sentance.  You dont know if they are just looking for some help til they can get straightened out, or just really looking for a hand out of free money.  If it was "my dr just said i have bipolar, can i get disability for that so i dont have to work and can quit my job?" then feel free to tear them appart for being lazy|`|oojO4WAraa	Take your medication and get a job.

It was determined by a phsycologist that I could not work and her decision is was put me on the SSDI. I didn't have to go through a lawyer or my own doctor. I applied online, and they called me.<br>  <br>  It also depends on how old you are/were when you decame disabled. For example my mom has been trying to get on SSI or SSDI for a while now because she's in severe pain every day because of her back, she has a problem with one of her hands where she can use her thumb and that limits some of her abilities, she has severe depression, yet because of her age, and also her lack of work history she was denied both of them. <br>  <br>  This is to one of the comments about people like us being lazy...for a few weeks now I have been wanting to go back to work. I am sick of staying at home! A friend of mine has his own business and was willing to offer me a job. About a week before what would have been my first day I fell into a low and had a panic attack - now this was just at home. Imagine what I would have been like had I returned to work. It would have been an embarassment for both of us. So to the douche who thinks we're just lazy...be glad that you don't have to deal with what we have, be glad that you're healthy and "normal". But don't shove it in our face that we're not! >:O|`|cSqx1DxKaa	Bipolar is controllable with meds, as is ADHD.  Why would you need social security?

His medicine was just about the strongest dose you could take.

This is imprtant so that you do not potentially spread this disease to anyone else. <br>  Make an appointment to see a doctor as soon as possible so if it is genital warts you can begin a treatment program and get medications to reduce your symptoms<br>  <br>  Genital warts is NOT curable, you will always have this disease. Symptoms and flareups can be reduced with treatment. You really need a doctor to give you all the information so you can be knowledgeable on living with this disease and how to reduce teh risks of spreading it to others.|`|AP2FnaWcaa	Thats not true it can eventually go. Dont listen to anybody that tells you its really bad, people make too much of a fuss, genital warts are just like any other type of warts you may get like on your feet for example<br>  <br>  Go to a sexual health clinic as soon as possible just incase they spread, and then they will perform a little test and either give you a cream, freeze it or in a more extreme case perform a small surgery<br>  <br>  But DONT have sex!!! Even if you use a condom you can still spread it through skin to skin contact because it depends on where it is. <br>  <br>  And, again the most important thing that fights this infection off is your immune system SO, DONT drink or smoke or eat crap food! Get some immune boosting vitamins like garlic capsules and get lots of vitamin c in your system. Sometimes the immune system alone can fight it off but its better to get a treatment for it as it can cause long term problems in the future
vVka4ZA0aa	You have an eating disorder. <br>  First of all, you need to eat to be healthy. <br>  Personally, I would recommend talking to a dietitian/nutritionist about eating healthy and losing weight.<br>  <br>  Go to www.thedailyplate.com linked with www.livestrong.com and register. Post on there and talk to people about losing weight. <br>  Go to the MyPlate section and enter your height, your weight, and how many pounds you want to lose per week (anything more than 2 pounds a week is unhealthy), and start exercising. It's been said that you need at least 1200 calories to survive. So start eating, but don't binge and purge.<br>  <br>  A lot of people are struggling with weight loss, so find support, don't beat yourself up over it.|`|C3sqTngtaa	its not a normal relationship that you have with food.

When your body is being starved it teaches itself to store all the fat to preserve your energy.  As soon as you start bingeing again your body is still storing all the fat thinking it will not get anymore for a very long time meaning you actually gain weight instead of losing it. This is why people who try out all different kinda diets just keep getting bigger unless they stick to it for their entire lives!!<br>  <br>  The best thing for you to do to lose weight is to eat normally, whatever you want but just don't eat for the sake of it. Eat when your hungry an stop when you are full! Its so simple.<br>  <br>  If you are worried you have an eating disorder you should visit your GP as soon as poossible before it gets any worse.<br>  <br>  Good Luck X|`|Cg2OdQ0xaa	this is not normal and you should seek help.

9QyrW2iCaa	I started out with braces from the 3rd to 11th grade.  I remember that achey feeling I would get every time they would get tightened.  I also had "eye teeth" that had to be moved down.  What I would tell myself was that this pain was good and that I would have straight teeth.  I trained my brain to think of this particular discomfort as doing something good for me.  If I couldn't feel any pain how would I know my teeth were being moved into a better position?  I recommend drinking cool liquids, but even more importantly, get yourself distracted with things you like do -- sports, video games, making art projects --whatever takes your mind away from your physical body.    Good luck to you and I wish you less pain!  : )|`|DzHB8z6Yaa	Act fast. The constant adjustments involved when you have braces cause inevitable pain. However, if you treat the pain early, you are much more likely to make the experience more tolerable.     Step 2: Take pain relievers. Over-the-counter pain relief drugs such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen can help treat the deep mouth pain associated with new braces and constant adjustment. This pain originates from the pressure of shifting teeth and extends into the gums and jaws.     Step 3: Use wax. Orthodontists generally offer an unlimited supply of wax to patients. The friction associated with wires and metal fittings in the mouth tend to cause sores and cut the insides of cheeks and lips. By placing a ball of wax over the metal of the braces, especially at night, patients can avoid further irritation.     Step 4: Invest in an oral anesthetic. Over-the-counter anesthetics like Anbesol and Orajel temporarily deaden the mouth. Dab a small amount of the anesthetic on a cotton swab and apply it to sores in the mouth. The gel will deaden the spot and completely take away the pain for a limited amount of time. This method is particularly effective when trying to fall asleep at night. The gel wears off by morning, but allows a pathway to sleep.     Step 5:Try toothpaste for sensitive teeth. If you have a naturally sensitive mouth, a toothpaste for sensitive teeth can lessen mouth sensitivity over time and treat pain on a long term basis. By lessening the sensitivity of the mouth the adjustment of braces hurts less.     Step 6: Give it time. A tolerance to the pain associated with braces takes time. The longer you have braces the less you will experience the sores, cuts and deep pain that are common in the early stages.|`|sEihaeLNaa	take some tylenol every 4 hrs and buy some choleseptic spray (sold at any drug store) and spray it on your teeth but dont swallow.

I would also like to know his age because the older you get, the higher the norm would be. My blood pressure would vary from 160/90 to 180/96 under prescribed medication. I lost weight & even though it's still not normal, I'm ranging 140/80. My eye sight, under the high blood pressure, got bad as well. So he may also want to think about his eye sight. I'm 46 & have been fighting high blood pressure for 6 yrs now but as far as it ever reading normal again, I've given up. After losing the weight, I've also stopped taking my medication as well because the medication kept increasing but it wasn't helping.    http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.jsp?ar...|`|AA10614514	He absolutely needs to be seen and treated with medication to control the blood pressure.

nAvvthR1aa	There are many factors that can cause a missed period such as eating habits sudden weight gain or loss stress or if you are very active.   If you and your boyfriend had sex without any form of protection it is possible you are pregnant. It doesnt matter it he ejaculated in you or not  there is still sperm in pre-c** that comes out when the guy is arroused he sometimes doesnt ever feel it and if any got in or around your vagina you might be pregnant. If this is the case go out and but a pregnancy test|`|WXpdkbG8aa	Even if a guy doesn't have an orgasm and fully ejaculate, he can still precum which is not preventable and he won't know exactly when he does it. A girl can get pregnant from precum. But only being 15 and starting your period in August,  you may just be going through an irregular bout in your period. You can start taking birth control to help regulate your period. When I was 12, I would bleed for 2 weeks straight and then I wouldn't have a period for months. Birth control really regulated me and helps with other period "problems" such as acne, cramps and flow. Take a pregnancy test to be sure you aren't pregnant and good luck!|`|V0jeZ4pxaa	y wuldnt u wait 2 b abstinent n e way.. gosh .. dersz sum wrong wit ppl desz daisz, but yeah.. congratulations..

Since you only started last year then it might still be irregular. I'd see a doctor just in case|`|4CyXKudJaa	you could be pregnant, so buy a predictor or go to your doctor, but don't worry too much because some girls only have a period every six months... my cousin only just had her period and her last one was six months ago, but I'd still buy a predictor just to be sure. Look up other pregnancy signs, such as spotting, increased appetite and bigger boobs.|`|srdu8X59aa	Look. Realistically you can get pregnant from precum however the odds are that you are not. there are people who try conceiving for years, and they get no where. you haven't had your period for that long so it could be that it just hasn't regulated itself yet. Plus you have to figure that if you hadn't had your period for 4 months. there would be DEFINITE signs of pregnancy: morning sickness, bigger boobs, if your a very small girl its possible that you could start showing it would just look like you have a full bladder... you could get a test just to double check. id put money on a negative response. if and when you do get a pregnancy test get the digital one that says"pregnant" or "not pregnant" they're like $15.00 but the ones with the lines can often be unclear and you don't want to wonder was it two lines?? or just one" the lines can be very faded. That's my best advice i could give you. you should also get on birth control.. especially if your going to be having sex... and unprotected sex for that fact. you don't want to wind up pregnant in 10th grade.|`|GY5OfFwkaa	if you have only just recently started your period like 507 months ago then your periods will be irregular but because you have had sex (well tried) then you could be but you should take a test and see, if you happen to not be pregnant talk to your doctor and see if you need to go on birth control to make your periods regular  hope i helped hun good luck :)|`|wEvyWFQHaa	The main cause for girls skipping periods are body problems e.g. weight gain, loss, diets, stress, piercings etc. I would maybe go to the doctors anyway, just in case...

bZhIEy1Waa	Unless you're able to inject yourself with some Novocaine ( the numbing juice the dentisr uses ) on a daily basis you need that op bought forward - and quick! If its not removed asap you'll find yourself with an impacted tooth and you'll know all about pain if that happens. Ring your dentist first thing in the morning and ask for Ibuprofen 600mg plus a very strong pain killer such as Dihydrocodeine 30 mg or similar - theres no need for you to suffer as your are, poor thing. Ask for an immediate removal but given the state of our health service you know its going to be Friday or next Monday before you get in! Shocking! Recently, given the amount of aggro i've had with my teeth lately, i've discovered Anbesol, a liquid anaesthetic which has been a God send in the dark hours of the night when the pain seems twenty times worse than during the day! It comes in a 6.5ml bottle ( very small ) and costs about 2.50 - 3.00 but i'd pay a tenner for it because its so good! You just put your little finger over the end of the bottle, tip it up to coat your finger tip then rub it right away into the sore area - bliss ha ha. Also, try Corsodyl mint mouthwash, it has antiseptic properties and cleanses your gums and Bonjela is also very good at relieving the immediate sharp pain you get with toothache. I really feel for you because i know exactly what you're going through but trust me when i say that the Anbesol will keep you going until the tooth is removed as will some good pain relief. Also, a little tip - sleep upright! Put loads of pillows behind you and sleep sort of sitting upright - laying flat seems to make toothache worse! Keep yourself warm and if you can bear it, tie a scarf tight around your jaw! People think its an old wives tale but it does really help with the discomfort. The knot goes at the top of your head so you won't want to go shopping with it ha ha but it'll help greatly when you're indoors. I really hope you can get a quick appointment at the dentist / hospital and get the bloody thing out but then other problems will start!!! Definitely NO smoking or you'll end up with a dry socket ( much, much worse than wisdom tooth pain!!! ), endless salt water mouth washes and mashed up food!!! Best of luck to you mate.

6cf45f1e4b4887d9df5323037a43c464aa	No, but it would reduce the pleasure you have from sex.    Do NOT cut the frenulum - it is extremely nerve rich.    And in any case, it wouldn't make any difference to the length.|`|Yb99bIdnaa	No, but it might change the angle the glans (head) sits at when the foreskin is pulled all the way back.    The length of the shaft, and the size of the head, would not change. And those are all that determine the size. All the frenulum does is tilt the head when the foreskin's pulled back.|`|4arnbpUCaa	No, it would not increase the size.    Removing the frenulum (by a procedure called a frenuloplasty) is only really done if the patient is suffering from "frenulum breve", which prevents the foreskin being pulled back easily.|`|K4zsztkRaa	Absolutly not. Why would it?  The frenulum isn't holding anything back.    -Connor|`|pzLDXL6gaa	No.    If you have frenulum breve they can surgically loosen the frenulum.

5kXxr6r0aa	as a freshman, if you've never worked out in your life before, you should have simple aims, aim for benching 5 pounds over your bodyweight, aim for never max-cleaning just yet, but try to get to the point where you can do clean reps at 115. and finally, you should find an alternative workout for your quadriceps, because as a freshman you should NOT squat. seriously, don't touch a barbell with the thought of squatting until your 16, i've seen lots of people seriously hurt themselves, stunt their growth, and even compress their spines because they were squatting at age 15.    if you can do that by freshman year, you're on the right track, sophomore year you can increase intensity and start searching for that stronger progress.

CJbZw69haa	You aren't screwed...If you go buy a box of tampons there are instructions on the box that show you how to properly insert a tampon, so just ask your dad to take you to the store.  Try to put it in while being in front of a mirror so you can see what you're doing(just bring a small mirror in the bathroom). The whole thing should fit comfortably inside your cervix with just the string hanging out. Remember that if you feel any discomfort then it is not in right. When I took ballet I would wear pads it I had to and just put an extra pair of underwear on so that it would stay in place then put my leotard on and you couldn't even tell I was wearing one :). Then if we got a break I just changed it in between the breaks and went back to dancing.|`|tiWMepyZaa	u can still dance i could|`|2chpkWtiaa	That sucks. Either miss your ballet, or ask for tampons. There is no other suggestion.|`|qzVGaVWgaa	tell your dad to run out and get you tampons.  if it is too weird for you to then contact one of your ballet friends and see if htey can help you out and bring you one or something|`|GgWrhISBaa	Sorry hun but u r screwed.... Unless u ask ur dad to go buy u some and then just read the instructions but if not ur going to have to skip ballet........|`|abF3qO3aaa	I used to be in Ballet as well and have dealt with this same issue.   Last resort:Miss ballet practice because "you don't feel good"  Now here are a couple things you can do. In my old ballet school there were always tampons in the bathroom for emergencies. If your school does not provide them, you ARE in a mostly all girl environment and all you would have to do is ask one of the girls around, most girls keep at least one in their dance bag. Also try the front desk. It can be a little embarassing, but every girl has gone through and no one will make fun of you for it.   You can also stop at a store on the way just tell your dad you need to pick up some "girlie items"   Now when you say "ask my mom how to use them" are you saying that you've never used them before? If you haven't, trust me when I say they DON'T hurt at all. In fact once you try it out, you'll probably never want to go back to pads again. When you buy a box, they come with instructions inside. They're pretty basic. If you try it and feel any discomfort take it out and try it again with another one.   One more thing, if you own a darker colored leotard, wear it. Good luck|`|vQuoI4VJaa	tell your dad that you don't feel good.|`|O2SIJqHXaa	oh that really sucks!  do you have any spandex shorts? maybe a skirt? or a sister/friend?|`|pPc2kZfwaa	CALLED TAMPAX PEARL|`|qSnF1jseaa	you can wear a pad if those are available, or just suck it up and ask your dad to get you some, the instructions on the box work, thats how i learned|`|lJ2XG0QMaa	yea you need shorts. A pad alone with tights is not gonna cut it. Tampons- if you have never used them you need to get advise from mom how to do it, most girls use them wrong and that is embarrasing! Try and find some shorts to wear, or thick leggings. If not then you may just want to skip class :( Call friends tho and see who has shorts they can bring for you to use. Sweat pants maybe??|`|VFyERjSSaa	that really sucks.  just ask ur dad to take u  to the store and just buy some tampons.  there are instrucktions in the box.  dont' miss the ballet!!|`|T1vamdtjaa	fake that your sick or call a friend and tell her if you could use one. use ALOT of toilet paper untill you get to your lesson and find your friend

First off you might have a latex allergy to the condom this would explain the lack of duration for the onset of the itchiness.  Likewise if this is the first instance of genital contact the itchiness could be explained by genital lice (Pthirus pubis) AKA crabs.  However if the itchiness was before any instance of oral/genital contact it is likely caused by acute inflammation from the excess exercise.  If the itchiness persists or bumps/lesions arise consult a Doctor.  Likewise, if your bf has had symptoms in the past of STDs he likely has STDs even if symptoms are not currently present.  It is important to note that STD's are still transferable even if they are asymptomatic(not showing signs).  The burning while peeing is of great concern and you should consult a doctor. My opinion is that it might be a UTI(urinary tract infection) and should be treated with medication provided by your doctor.|`|0aDTFQOdaa	You got yeast

Drinking the alkaline water is one key, the other is the 2.5 PH water applied to the skin disease, and it will go away in around 5 months.    Good Luck !    I don't think it is a good idea to put the 2.5 PH water into your ears, it is said to not use it next to your eyes.

And remember how mom always told you to wash behind your ears, you might want to keep that in mind and make sure you concentrate on that area and then make sure you dry it well so it will not reoccur.

Go see a doctor.|`|yeFZzstvaa	I think you have an infection.|`|f6d1a03e184c22ee41b0717f7c9d38feaa	Don't store your lunch in there|`|qT8yID3Taa	Haha, its Vagina* and it's *Odor.  But, it might be because you have pubic hair which makes it smell. If you want/can, you can shave. Otherwise your probably just going through puberty.|`|emNCaAq7aa	Douche with a mixture of white vinegar and water. Eat fewer carbs. You have a mild fungal infection, washing with soap and water does not help.|`|SnDKiuVmaa	why are you asking other people how to wash your vagina??     you do know little kids go on this and i dont think they want to read about someones vagina do they...|`|zXtXeEBBaa	You probably have some type of infection, but I would try Refresh, it works really well.|`|ZqmgJvHBaa	Everyone has their own distinct scent... if you have a consistent bad or fishy smell, you likely have either an infection or need to change your diet.  What you eat will affect every scent your body produces, vagina included.  If you have a scent that smells like bread or yeast or you are experiencing any discomfort, you need to see your doctor about an infection.  In order to maintain a "pleasant" smell, avoid cigarettes, drugs, alcohol, and non natural foods.  Also try to cut back on sweets and unhealthy foods, as these can give you that fishy smell.  Make sure you wear clothes that allow some air flow around the area, as keeping everything cramped up without any room to breathe can also cause unpleasant smells -- it's a similar principal to when you wake up in the morning, your breath may smell bad because your mouth has been closed up for so long.  If you are sexually active, make sure to at least rinse off afterwords, because that can give you a distinct funky smell as well.  Also make sure to rinse off regularly while you are on your period... obviously, this can give you a nasty smell if you pay no attention to it.  Your vagina is self-cleaning, just like your ears, so don't go over board with washing it to remove a bad smell.  Douching is not necessary in any way, and can actually cause problems!  If you feel like you just have to douche,  use only plain water, and don't go overboard. If you wash too often, you're likely to throw off your own natural Ph balance, which can result in an infection.    In general, though, if you have no infections, aren't douching like crazy, and aren't just being unclean, the smell is most likely attributed to something you are putting in your body.  Everything you put in comes out in some form or fashion.  Eating unhealthy food or taking drugs or anything like that in excess can cause unpleasant bodily odors,  give you nasty smelling sweat, make your body taste strange to other people (that is, if someone is tasting you...), affect the coloring of your skin, and change the look of your hair.  For example, a way you can be tested for drugs is through taking a sample of your hair, because whatever drugs you may have taken will come out in your hair and stay there until you cut that hair off!  Take daily vitamins, eat primaraily healthy and natural foods, and unavoid things you know are unhealthy, and you will quickly begin to notice a better smell.  If you just can't stand the smell and it's taking too long to go away, you can try using a body detoxification regimine (which can be found at your local health food store) to help speed things up.|`|kXeGlHXOaa	look every girl has an odor no matter how clean u are if its an unusual odor then u mite wnna vistit ur obgyn is its not then here's some awesome things that help, after sex or my cycle i use this http://www.summerseve.com/Douche.asp    and to get rid of any odor i use this it makes u feel fresh and works really well.  http://www.summerseve.com/Spray.asp|`|CuLB4C6qaa	go to the doctor. right now , its an infection, hurry hurry hurry hurry. you will die
Qz3sii2caa	Why is this in the injuries section? Having a big nose is not an injury, unless of course it's big because you got punched in the nose.    How can you tell if you have a big nose? There is no such thing; they come in all shapes and sizes.|`|lAZWTLtRaa	There aren't any signs.   Everyone is shaped differently, and you just have to accept who you are. A big nose to you may be a small nose to someone else, everyone has their opinions. Remember, it's attractive to be PROPORTIONAL, having a small nose and a big face looks just as bad as having a big nose and a small face.  If someone is smaller than you, it's natural for them to have a smaller nose, it doesnt mean yours is big.  If you're really concerned just take a picture of the front of your face and one side to see how big it is.  Honestly, I've only seen one or two people in real life with a nose that is slightly out of proportion to the rest of their face, and it's not that bad. You need to accept who you are and stop worrying about what other people thing! You're beautiful for who you are, not for what other people think.|`|7PO2ugfGaa	If it looks big then it's big. There are no signs to a big nose. A big nose is a big nose.|`|613a6f45d04f0240c6f5b3512bdd1daaaa	Do you mean big nose as in sticks out, or big nose as in wide? Take a photo of your face, and then try to draw it, just the outline. Then you can see what your proportions are. Try drawing a picture with the outlines of the nose and face in relation to the eyes and such for another person, who has an average looking nose. Comparing the two noses, and make your decision.    I think it's unlikely that you really do have a big nose...I'm sure it's beautiful. :)|`|7uIYkvrKaa	if someone tells you.|`|kQStNgzUaa	I don't think it matters. Remember, George C. Scott had a big nose, Vin Diesel has a big nose, Shanis Twain does as well, and these are examples of attractive people. Honestly, whatever your nose looks like, I am sure it suits your face.
AA10450066	The pain your describing could be anything (you only have 1 spinal cord)  but the fact that your white blood cells are a little high means that somewhere in your body there's an infection.It would have nothing to do with an MRI.I'm surprised to see that it's the first thing he ordered.Usually a CAT scan is ordered first.But to answer your question an MRI is a machine that will show the different parts of your body and put it in a 3d x-ray type picture so the doctor can see if everything inside your body is o.k.This doesn't hurt but can be noisy so you'll be given a pair of earphones and sometimes they will let you listen to music while the test is taking place as you need to be still.If you need anything while in the machine there's a 2 way microphone and all you have to do is talk out loud,but they'll tell you all this when you go.Good luck and I hope this helps
xeeQ9QkLaa	well a doctor would an obvious answer but clearly the obvious has eluded him. good luck with that.|`|ZA18KoC9aa	tell him to see a doctor for the best advice!|`|Wgf5Wrfjaa	He needs to go to the doctor!!!
jZtMrbwCaa	It's normal, teenage guys tend to eat alot. Because by the time their 20 they should have stored about half of the nutrients they will need for the rest of their life.So don't worry, teen guys need lots of food for developing their bodies and growing up. Don't worry, he won't end up at 450 PBS. His appetite will slow down as he gets older|`|6cf45f1e4b4887d9df5323037a43c464aa	If he can get up and go out, can hold down a job, and pay his way, then his weight is NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.    If he's housebound and can't move, then you have it in your power to cut his food down to the point where he loses weight.    It's the relatives that LET depressed people get so huge they can't move.|`|E64juLwJaa	You dp eat a lot of garbage in stead of healthy food:and that will cause heart problems in the long run..Way to fat and salt.How about your blood pressures?Must be sky high.  Your brother can have a high metabolism,so he does not gain weight:but still this is no good at all.  Planets|`|bpxyGWrYaa	It depends on metabolism. Some people simply need to take in more nutrients. If he excersizes enough or, at least, burns off enough calories to maintain a healthy body, then there shouldn't be a problem. The only thing I can say is that is seems like he eats a lot of junk food, which can be a bad thing.|`|kgQK3bMlaa	Your brother needs a Diet Advisor to control his appetite.|`|iOOw74DXaa	dude your fine, i have three older brothers and they eat like hell unleashed, we go through like three cartons of orange juice a day! they are hungriest in theyre teens, my brothers are 15  ( hes a twin) 17 and 19 and they eat soooo much. its totally normal. they grow later than girls and so they need to eat more
mBUfy9zMaa	Sometimes kids who come from a background of abuse, have a really backwards perception of things.  When I was younger I was sexually abused and I went through this huge lying stage.  I didnt lie about being sexually abused or anything like that, I just lied about stupid stuff.  And now that Im older, I dont do that anymore, but I do have a really backwards perception.  Like if a guy gave me a hug, I'll think, oh he wants something from me.  Which then leads to, oh he must want sex, and then its like all hell breaking loose because I feel like Im in danger.  And thats because of my past.  I dont know if your step son is anything like me, (Im 18) But I think he does need psychological help.  Thats the only way he can get better.  Im in therapy right now, and I can promise you that it has really helped me get better.  Good luck with everything!!|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Idk about extensive psychiatric care bue he probably needs more disicpline. Im not trying ot make you feel bad or anything, but if he came from a bad mother like you state he needs to get her habits out of his mind and new rules in place. Make everything a privlage. He lies, take away luxuries. Slowly give him back one thing if he keeps it up, take one away if hes bad. something like that. Also maybe set up an appointment with the school counselor|`|9Q1muFGXaa	I think he does need some form of counseling. He is 9 and should know better to lie about those types of things.  I would get him help as soon as you can. If you don't his mental state could get worse and cause more problems for you all later sown the rode. Counseling is his best option and see where that takes your family and him. As im sure this has brought some tension and stress in your home for everyone. Family counseling may even be good as well. He should still seek counseling by himself. Family counseling will help you all understand things better and be able to cope with things easier and healthier with one another. Hope this helps.|`|qYlkAyiJaa	He probably should get counseling, but I think it's somewhat normal for a background like his.  It sounds like he just really wants to be comforted by you and that's how he knows he can get reassurance, attention and love.|`|4oDn5zIpaa	if mental disorders run in the family there is blood work and other tests to check for them. Also he may just want attention or really not like the nanny. Also i would ask his pediatrition or family docotr i dont think extensive psychiatric care is needed but look into it. your doctor will be able to help you with that. Also he may be bipolar i know it sounds out there but my older brother use to do the same thing and became violent as he got older. Also he may be a pathological liar either they believe their own lies or will even addmit to them later. There are some tests and i would talk to my doctor|`|XzLUA7ataa	You've already said that he came from an abusive background.  What help has he received in dealing with that trauma in his life?  It may not be a situation that requires extensive psychiatric care, but a psychological evaluation by a professional would be worthwhile.  Ask for help from your family doctor, the child's pediatrician, and the school counselor.  It also takes considerable adjustment to start a life with a step father.  You may need some help with parenting skills to adjust to your new role as his father.  There's no shame in that.  Seek help.|`|7fSQa9Zbaa	Maybe your step son is looking for attention, and he might resent you for leaving him at home with nannies.  If he makes up a believeable story, then you might be forced to let he/she go, or so he thinks.  I would spend more time with my step son and dedicate more time to getting to know him.|`|AH3ZEBbYaa	Your son definitely needs some help.    There's absolutely nothing wrong with him, he's just had a difficult life and addressing the issue now will help him later on in life.    I would recommend at least seeing a psychologist or psychiatrist, as their opinion will be better than any on this website.    If you do decide to go on this route, don't worry about feeling inadequate as a parent- this isn't a normal thing that parents should have to deal with. In fact, you're being a better parent by providing him with the help he needs, and in the long term, this will likely benefit him.  He just has some issues dealing with his mother and needs help to get through them.
BDlS6XdGaa	It could be a number of things.  You seem to be indicating your ACL, but if there is no weakness or instability in your knee and you have played soccer for two years I'm hesitant to indicate that that is your problem.  If there is a similar bulge on your other knee that would point to Osgood Schlatters.  Otherwise it could be related to tendinitis, arthritis or patellafemoral syndrome, both annoying and painful but not very serious and can be corrected over time with more rest and some simple exercises.  If it's occured for two years though I think you should see a orthopedic doctor.  Insurance should cover most of it and it may result in a solution that resolves your pain or prevents you from a serious injury that may be impending.|`|ghiXastzaa	This is pretty serious issue. You have torn your ACL. Go to a doctor immediately (or call an ambulance).|`|XiOIBwbPaa	I have somewhat the same problem with both my knees, I've had the problem for about 8 years I'm only 15 to :(...FINALLY my mother took me to the doctor I got x-rays and blood work, and I have fluid build up in both of them. you could have the same thing, I suggest going to a doctor and getting it checked out, it could be the same as me, or something worse, but I'm taking a pill called Naproxen to take away my pain and bring the fluid down, the fluid still there but the pain goes away, :) its awesome.|`|72JZHunmaa	I would go and see a doctor|`|F6jBrNmuaa	???????|`|RC2aQBkgaa	See what a physical therapist has to say or your doctor. I'm not sure what exactly this could be, but it sounds serious. My mom is a physical therapist and usually she deals with long term problems but you would need to see what a doctor says about it first. You might have like fractured something or some bone got moved is something, which is why it feels sharp. But that's just my guess.

If diagnosed, there are medicines to control it.  Good Luck :)|`|4rFwGkxlaa	Ok yeah...I have had that same scenario happen to me..I, too, was a cutter. You are creating stress by hallucinating so that you can justify cutting because it makes you feel better. You should probably talk to someone you can trust and DEFINITELY research more about this on the internet. If you dont stop cutting the hallucinations will only become worse and more graphic.

Do a google search for clinics near you.|`|YC8X25OXaa	It's horrible situations that I hear about like this, when suffering people have to pay money they can't afford to lose on simple healthcare products, that makes me eternally grateful for living in the UK and having the NHS.  We might moan about it all the time, but I know that if I have a medical problem I can go and get it sorted and not have to worry about whether I can afford it.    As the previous poster said, you can get into serious trouble if anyone finds out you did this - it's spectacularly illegal.  Also, what will you do if the doctor doesn't want a urine sample out of a condom but wants one there and then?  It'll be hard to get away with it.  Can't you tell your doctor that you've been prone to these infections and have the symptoms again?  Are doctors sympathetic to money problems in terms of health issues in the US?    If not, aren't there free clinics for minor health problems available?  Would you be able to get to one of those?    I'm really sad about your situation, it makes me really angry and I hope you get it sorted without having to break the law.  And in answer to your original question, no, I don't think so.  Usually samples are checked under microscopes for infections and although the bacteria will be dead, they'll still be there, so it'll still look like you have an infection.|`|PhkWt9vEaa	Don't make your friend carry around your pee.

To start out, I said, "My name is Rachel, I'm a freshman at KU, and you'll have to excuse me, but after two weeks of being sick, I STILL sound like a man."

oE77lovwaa	Well, look at your question again. Of course an orange tongue isn't "normal". My advice to you would just make sure your tongue wasn't colored from a food/drink that you consumed rather than your piercing. If your tongue is still orange after brushing your teeth and washing your mouth out thoroughly, and seems to be infected or anything abnormal then you should look into asking your doctor what this may be and get to a quicker recovery.|`|S6J2qq3iaa	if its your first one then yes

zP0UTMgxaa	It sounds like allergies to me. That is how I feel when my allergies start bothering me. My nose has felt stuffy for days at a time and have no other complications. What I do for my allergies is I take over the counter zyrtec at night and I use my humidifier at night. You would be amazed at how much using a humidifier works. I read somewhere that during the winter when we use heat it takes out all the moisture in the air and makes it very dry. This makes our nose stuffy. I have found out that the steam humidifier works better than the cool mist. It puts more moisture in the air. I hope this helps.|`|AJEYXzIUaa	the best way i tell if i have a cold or allergies at that time, is the rest of my body, if its just sinus's then it's usually allergies, but if i have body aches and low Energy usually a cold...    that's how it is for me anyway...
1oBilGHuaa	Many people find it hard to speak in front of others.  Try to practice speaking to a group of your friends or in front of your family.  You are just as good as anyone else in your class.  They are a bunch of idiots to laugh at someone.  Try to remind yourself that they are not worth getting nervous over.  Best Wishes to you.|`|hmsMpECkaa	What I think it is is you are confusing the feeling of the blood rushing to your face as embarrassment when it is not.  And you are reacting to things, like getting in front of class, as though you are embarrassed because that is the feeling you think it is.  But let me see if this will calm you down a little bit and I hope it does.    When you think thoughts, your brain is not quiet.  Each thought, each word, each sentence, causes a string of electrical current in your brain and it gets a little warm when you have a big presentation to give.  Well, how does the brain cool down?  It cools itself by the blood that surrounds it.  Your face fills with blood, your ears fill with blood, your hair fills with . . . no, not really, but don't think you are embarrassed.     Your made to get up in front of class to give reports so that you will learn public speaking and you are going to do it.|`|HIskrREJaa	i've always had that problem and i'm 27 now... try to block them out of your mind when you start talking.  i used to have to get to class earlier than the rest and sit right in front or the second row. that way i could focus on the teacher and not see everyone looking at me.|`|6SgChhyLaa	I have the same problem! and i'm also 16 in the 11th grade  What I do is ask the teacher if I can present just to them.  I don't get as nervous when it is just me and the teacher  even though I am still nervous, i am more calm    if they don't let you then just try your best to not let it affect you  if you have to prepare a presentation present it to your friends, practice it in the mirror  know it so well, that you have a lower chance of screwing up  and this may sound bizzare, but don't eat at school, it will drain your energy, and if you don't have energy then you can't get as anxious!    hope this helped, it has helped for the most part for me    if you need to talk just email me at  monicap76@gmail.com|`|uk0rxbVIaa	I had the same thing when I was in high school. Breath! Picture nothing but a empty class around you, and try not to get distracted. You could also try to visualize a dot in a upper corner or something and focus on it. Most important, think that it doesn't really matter what other people say about you and try to relax. It's not that hard. Think of something pretty :) Hope this helps, it helped me
auxDjCylaa	Ok, first of all, how are you working out? If you are lifting weights, it may appear as though you are gaining, or keeping the same weight. This is because muscle is more dense than fat. If you are lifting weights, but still not sweating much, find a friend who will push you a little or just work some cardio into your routine. (work one muscle to fatigue, then run 1/4 mile, etc.)     If you are eating 3k calories a day, be careful of what you are eating. Anything greasy, sugary, etc. will add pure fat and make you feel tired or slow.     I use a vitamin/protein drink called EAS Myoplex. I really like it because it packs in 50% or more of most daily supplements, along with 42g protein per shake. The whole thing is also only 300 calories too.     The best part is that it tastes great, but the worst part is that it is kind of expensive. I buy it at my local Walmart for $12/pack of four. Each package does have a coupon for $4 off 2 packs on it though.    Hope I helped.

NKmeIExLaa	i have no idea but my sisters friend just said her teacher said her husband got kidney stones from drinking to many protein shakes. thats weird how u asked the question the same day my sister heard that. idk if its true tho....|`|XZqSO94saa	I'v never heard of such thing.   How is that possible?    Protein shake's are filled with nutrition, - not creatine thoe, and high-sugar one's.   Try a lower, volmunized protein shake like "ensure protein" or "boost protein".  But you deffinatly will not develope kidney stone's by drinking protein shake's.     Hope i'v helped!|`|ee3mDKNDaa	no you cant bro, if u go protein overload u will have problems with ur kidneys yes, and then ur body will try to resolve this by flushing out the system. Basically u get a much more serious version of diarhia when u go protein overload. I know this from experience bro. Everyday u should take 1 gram of protein for every pound you weigh.    btw bro u look ripped already, so dont go to crazy no homo

9zAgNxDjaa	Ok so I have seen people say to pop it. While yes, this will get rid of the stye, DON'T DO IT. The nasty stuff on the inside can infect other areas of your eye and just give you more styes.     A stye is a form of the staphylococcus bacteria. The bacteria resides most commonly in a person's nose. So to get a stye, usually I'm guessing people wipe their nose then later in the day, wipe their eye as well. Try to avoid this.    It is basically just a small pimple on the backside of your eyelid though. The only safe way to get rid of it is either with a warm teabag (apparently it contains some chemical that fights the infection) or just use a warm cloth. I recently had a stye and it hurt like hell, so I did a bunch of research and that was the only answer I could find. Lucky for me, it was gone by morning.    I used 2 teabags, and warmed a cloth about 3 or 4 times.|`|Z9360MMxaa	Heat up a tea bag or a cloth and hold it there reheating it as it cools. The heat will help speed the stye along.|`|v0GwTTsVaa	Bare with the pain and pop it. My sister gets them occasionally and slides her wedding ring over it firmly until it pops.|`|k1E24xXjaa	You can actually pop the stye if you really want, though it is a little bit sore cause of the awakward place. A Stye is pretty much a little zit.  But a warm cloth on your eye would also help it.|`|ZSvNNl1Laa	Hi, I used to get stys on my eyes also. I found that by gently rubbing the sty with a gold ring, a couple of times in a day for two days, that the sty would disappear. It has something to do with the properties in the gold itself..

Now u just stopping i dont see that wouldnt recommend that id get him lil weights like 2lbers and let him workout with u with those if he wants..that's what i let my 7yr old sister do to be honest she is happy im like go ahead do 20 jumping jacks and after a few times she got bored but comes down every once in a while with her 2lb weights i workout in my basement too so yeah i know where ur coming from|`|LVbF00iAaa	when you leave (for college i presume) have the absemnet cleared out or locked up|`|oE77lovwaa	He's obviously doing it because you are, and that he is looking up to you. Maybe your little brother thinks that this is the only opportunity he has to spend time with eachother. As lame as that is for a 16 year old guy, I'm sure that would mean a whole lot to him.    Try to do different activities with him that aren't so vigorous, like your bodybuilding. Go out in the yard and play soccer with him, or take him to a local recreation center and play basketball, etc. There's plenty of physical activity you could do with him that could wear him out if you'd spend some time with him. Go for a jog, or go on bikes, just expose him to sports and activities more appropriate to his age and I'm sure the situtation will improve.
RBGc1Hytaa	Yes, putting your pillow under your back is very bad for it. It makes your spine curve overtime, which is really really bad. Having a flat bed is good, but soft..not really. The pillow under your knees is elevating your knees and is good for your blood flow. I would get a better bed though.|`|Jd8cgFcQaa	You can type....so you should know how to use a pillow by now...|`|sf5iRPXCaa	I don't know if it will make your back hurt, but putting it under your knees is good for your circulation which can lead to a better night sleep.
AA12203329	No touching ones butt is assault or worse!|`|FtBHXQvHaa	yea its flirting .and playing grab a** can be fun as well|`|E64juLwJaa	Flirting you do by looking at a person and sticking around them,talk to them:but not go touching her immediately.  Planets|`|68r4mmOnaa	When you guys both look at eachother at the same time. It is weird. Smiling at them when it happens too.     Also, when he walks by ya and looks at you.|`|WXpdkbG8aa	Flirting can be anything from mental/verbal to physical. Physical flirting would definitely be whistling, touching, gawking, etc.|`|xdRI2QhRaa	Innuendos is more of flirting.    ex: "You look great in them jeans." (nice bum)  "Did you get everything for Xmas?" "Not "Everything."" (referring to not having a woman on Xmas)    Touching a girl's bum wouldn't be considered flirting.|`|wAjuh2YZaa	ya its totally flirting.|`|bLAwx3uvaa	Yeah it is. But by flirting it could just be sexually attraction. If i touch a girls butt in a playful way it usually means i just want to have sex with her and nothing more. So if you want a relationship out of it then you're looking in the wrong place, it's not your ***.|`|SmpPuIRzaa	It could be considered flirting by some girls, but some girls would consider that creepy and very rude.|`|kgQK3bMlaa	Looks, hand waves, asking her out, staring at her butt or legs, casually rub yourself with hers as you pass by.    Now touching her butt may be considered harassment.

5kXxr6r0aa	wow great food choices, you definitely know what you're talking about here.    good observation with the breakfast to lunch thing, that's a long time to wait, and even the most motivated dieter can have trouble sticking to their eating schedule with such a large gap, but if its just for today and if you managed to keep true to your plans, then that's still totally fine. your body processes foods at a rate where pushing back breakfast for one day should have minimal to no effect to whatever you plans are for tomorrow since you've got the whole day to process the food.    it sounds like a sick plan though, lots of protein and nutrients. I know this is obviously needless to say, but don't forget to drink a lot of water!    good luck with your goals man.|`|411e33cff378a28929963f21b85453abaa	you're pretty active, and you don't need to use alot of protein because excess protein is stored as....  drumroll,please......!

o9qWYVA9aa	When starting this med it may take up to two weeks to start feeling the positive effects.  My guess is it will be the same in this situation.  Over time, your body may require a higher dose to achieve the same effect.  Either way, you really need to discuss this with your doctor.  If you don't like the drug, they may be able to provide you with something else that is more effective.  Hope this helps.|`|XzLUA7ataa	This is something to discuss with your doctor and pharmacist.|`|JV0i77uiaa	You should talk with your doctor, maybe you need a different medication.  Sometimes doctors changes medication since your body get use to and you don't feel the effect. It takes about one or two weeks.  The doctor told me that antidepressant get flush out of body every day.  I think you had been to long on Zoloft.  I would suggest you call the doctor and discussed with him.
KgLJCYs8aa	a really, really long time.   the only thing on this list of any nutritional value is banana and tea. maybe the sandwich depending what was in it!  women don't need that many calories unless you're super super athletic... for example i eat 1500 when i don't work out, and 2000-2200 when i do work out. and something like a shake from mcdonalds has 1000 calories! so there is no way i could have that, it's just not worth it to me.     you know what to do- get control of yourself and eat cleaner :)|`|EYg62yNVaa	if you ran for about 3hrs it would burn about 1500 which is about your total. But it really depends on height and weight. Also remember your BMR will burn some of that. Look on a calorie counter to see how much with your height and weight.  Also a banana has at least 120!
6cbad830dfc7c6d8e96605646b334533aa	Having been clean and sober for over 21 years, the best thing to say is nothing until your friend is ready to talk, then just listen.    Some addicts (alcohol is a drug) are still in denial after as many as 2-4 weeks clean/sober.  If you had anything to do with the friend going into rehab, there might be resentment.  Let your friend have the 30 days under his/her belt.  Also remember, if your friend doesn't sever ties with his/her old ways/circle of friends, the possibility of relapse is greater.  Relocation hardly ever works because addicts can find drugs anywhere.    If you have to say something, be encouraging and understanding. I've been there and thank my higher power that I was strong enough to stay clean/sober (even tho my ex didn't).    The last piece of advice would be to find a 12-step program. Addicts and friends can go to a meeting together.  A lot of people say they don't work, but 'it works if you work it'.  My first six months were the toughest and I'm grateful for the program.    Now, even 21+ years later, I'll still hit a meeting once in a while.  The camaraderie is great, and now I get to tell the long story!    Good luck to you and to your friend.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Let it be known about how happy you are to see your friend off drugs and that you'll always be there for em. Just tell her/him how you feel about him and how you dont want him to end up dying. Make some plans with him/her maybe for when your friend gets out of there|`|ouzrDPaSaa	Just be yourself and act how you normally would around them, they'll simply appreciate the fact that you're there for them.  Let them know that nothing has changed and you're still friends, ask how they've been and say he or she can call you if they ever near to chat.  Talk about what you've been up to, I imagine it will be nice to hear about the "outside world" and "normal" stuff.  Good luck.|`|TCehI17kaa	Give him alot of support. Know that u are a friend who's there for him/her.|`|GgcBzuplaa	Give your friend support.  Let him/her know that  you will be there for them no matter what.  That even if they slip up it isnt the end of the world because with all recovery comes slip ups, another way to say it is its a few steps forward, one step back.  It takes time.  Just be patient and if he she needs to talk let them talk to you and listen to what they say without judging them.    I am talking from personal experience.  I was in rehab in the summer of 07 and knowing that friends are there for me helped.|`|5M0FBU89aa	Good suggestions all.    I'd just add;    1.    That you'll always have their friendship.  2.    If he/she harmed you in any way, you forgive them (that's a toughie sometimes).  3.    If there's a class or intervention they'd like for you to attend, you're ready.  4.   Once (s)he's out, you'll do whatever is necessary to encourage sobriety (which means you'll stay sober around him/her, or at least ask if (s)he's comfortable with you drinking around them).|`|lLm5uIuDaa	Depends on how good the friend is.  If that friend is one of your best friends, you speak to them as youl always have. You offer the same support you always have and reconfirm that without them many lives would change including yours.  That if they don't get straight they won't be able to see how you and others love them and want them to get better and achieve. Give them all the support you can and hope they can pull out of their demise.  But realize you cannot save them.  They will always in the end choose their own path. If the drug of their choice eats them alive there is really nothing you could offer to make it different.  I wish it were different but I haven't seen it so.  Do your best and hope for the best but don't take it on as a personal issue.  If your friend doesn't make the right decisions, they won't be because of you.  And good luck.  I applaud you trying to stay by your friend.|`|izjC42rSaa	just be supportive and agree that its the best thing i dont know ur friend or why they are in rehab but rehab is a good thing and is a hard step to take so the more support u can give about having healthy sober habits like make them ur own too  make sure u let them know that uare there for them and are happy that they are there for getting help its the best thing. Make sure they know u r there for them and dont abandon them or wait for them to get home to say anything|`|KOH5kPuLaa	encourage them to stay clean if you "USE"  just avoid them completely the best way to stay off drugs is to avoid the people you did them with   or got them from so if you fit into that category just stay away from them     GOOD LUCK 2 U N YOUR FRIEND|`|NuqtamRFaa	you are being a great friend by asking this question!    Your friend is never going to be cured from the disease, but with a lot of work he/she will live a wonderful life. You can be a good friend by just being there, a ear and a heart. It is not up to you if this person fails or makes it ( which can be very hard not to try and change them). He/she should come out of rehab with the tools of knowing what to do to stay sober.|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	Tell that person that you will be there for them.  You are a good guy ATE.

0jhzFOV8aa	They are hormonal and genetic and neurological. My Dad's mom got migraines but my own mom has no sympathy. About 10% of people get migraines regularly.    Stress affects hormonal chain reactions.  Cortisol is produced under stress and it's production triggers other hormones and inhibits the production of others. Sunlight triggers melatonin another hormone.    Advil (ibuprophen) works for me on everyday small migraines. I try to avoid pills because they are hard on the stomach and one can develop rebound migraines.    Actually, I have diverted onset of migraines with quickly drinking a sugary cola other times I have used sex to divert one (I guess it mixes the hormones).  I occassionally use a prescription (midrin) on a more powerful one.    I say divert because the quicker I do something to stop it the better chance I have to avoid one. When I can afford it (no insurance) acupuncture is an excellent way to prevent migraines. They can't be cured, but you can learn to successfully minimize their affect on your life.|`|I83sYbARaa	Here is the quickest way to stop a migraine , go to a health food store, pick up some homeopathic remedies (call ahead to see if they have it), buy one tube of homeopathic nat.mur 30x, and one tube of belladonna30x....   take 5 of each under the tongue the second you feel one coming on....      this works...  As far as the cause, I think it varies, but it mainly has to do with the constriction of the blood vessels....   and things that effect those...  There is long term relief only with in the knowledge of traditional chinese medicine... as an example you could look up Cinidium tabs , or look up an article by dr. subhuti dharmananda on the subject of your choice...which will show you the remedies practioners use...

GGmaSpHDaa	Lifting weights will not hinder your growth. This is just an unfortunate myth that keeps being repeated.     Doctors recommend strength training for youth.  It improves athletic performance and helps prevent injury.     Various medical websites have articles on this.  For example, see the following statement linked from the Cleveland Clinic:     Despite the previously held belief that strength training was unsafe and ineffective for children, health organizations such as the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) now "support children's participation in appropriately designed and competently supervised strength training programs."    http://www.infosports.com/clvclinic/stre...

wzskooHBaa	Okay,  I had to get 4 teeth pulled out last month. Since i got 2 pulled out each day, i had gotten about 4-5 shots on each side. After all that experience, i can say that getting shots don't hurt that bad. Seriously, it just feels like someone is pinching your mouth. When the shots are being given to you, make sure to relax. You will need to remember to relax. Because the tighter you make your mouth muscles, the more the shot will hurt. On my first shot i didn't relax, and it hurt. But then my dentist said to relax my mouth. And then the second shot didn't hurt. Oh and also, take a family member with you and hold their hand. That made me feel better. lastly, make sure to take a tylenol before you go to the dentist. Because while getting your teeth pulled put you won't feel a thing But after at least 1 hour your gums might feel a little sore.                 Good  Luck!!!|`|bZhIEy1Waa	Oh you poor thing, i know what you're feeling as i had two out the week before last and have to go back and have another two out when my mouth is healed!!! I'm going to be honest with you because to lie would make it worse for you tomorrow plus you'd lose faith with people on here who answer questions. I know it's different for everyone, we all have different pain thresh-holds but in my case ( i have a very high pain thresh-hold! ) i had to have the very last two teeth near the jaw hinge removed and i had to have 8 injections for numbing!!! Yes, it hurt like a b***h and bought more than one tear to my eye!!! Admittedly i didn't really feel the needle in the roof of my mouth after injection number 5 but it was still sore! Ask the dentist to wait as long as possible ( 10 / 15 mins ) after the injections before he / she starts pulling! That way you're guaranteed top numbness ha ha. When i had my injections all i was thinking was how much they hurt and when would she stop! Nice things like holidays and great days went straight out the window ha ha - it hurts too much! With the actual pulling you'll feel nothing at all i promise ( unless you have an abcess on the root as i did! ) but you will feel the pulling, the tugging and the sensation of the root snapping - its horrible but doesn't hurt - honest! Before you have the injections ask for a prescription for 600mg of Ibuprofen pain relief plus another strong pain killer such as Dihydrocodeine 30mg or similar - once the numbness wears off you'll need very strong pain relief - you've just had an operation after all!!! You'll need two weeks supply plus an antiseptic mouthwash although in all honesty, two teaspoons of salt in half a pint of warm water is better than all the clinical washes!!! Don't, whatever you do, use a normal, day to day mouthwash, they've too many chemicals in them. Corsodyl is ok but only use it for 3 days - it'll discolour your teeth if you use it any more than that plus you must water it down a lot if you use it after an extraction! Your dentist will 'pack' the socket - it's a wad of gauze used to stop the bleeding - and you should bite down on this gently for the first half hour. Leave the gauze in place for at least 4 hours after surgery and once its removed start the salt solution washes - just swill it gently around the socket and spit out. Don't forget to take your pain killers every 4 hours and tie a scarf around your face for warmth and comfort. Try and sleep half sitting up, put lots of pillows behind you and just relax - you can't go to work or school or college for the rest of the week - you need to be tucked up warm and comfy with a good book and plenty of soft, mashed up dinner!!! Don't eat for at least 2 / 3 hours after extraction and leave hot food alone for at least 6 hours! Also, don't even think about smoking!!! Thats if you do of course, but if you risk it you'll risk ending up with a dry socket which will cause you much more pain than the original toothache!!! For the first day or two stick to soft food such as soup, scrambled egg ( put some grated strong cheese in it then you won't feel like you're missing out ha ha ha ), jacket potato with butter and strong, grated cheese, over-done vegetables mashed into hot potato ( i'm getting hungry here ha ha ) with some gravy poured over, mmm i AM hungry ha ha. Just want to add, if you're anything like me and love your tea or coffee and cannot bear to wait 3 hours for a drink then make it warm and sip it off a spoon! Best of luck to you mate, i hope you sail through it and take your time recovering - its lovely being pampered ha ha, take care.|`|b0XiSgIbaa	They really don't hurt that bad...well they do a bit.  but not enough to make you scream or anything.     And how many shots depends on how sensitive your gums are, it's different for everyone.    And, think about something you really like.  For me, I thought about a few months before I went to Disney World on vacation with my friends so I thought about our funny memories.    You'll be okay.  But really, it hurts more after the teeth are pulled than when you get the shots.  So take painkillers, those help a lot.  don't bother taking pain killers before you go to the dentist though.    hope I helped :)|`|q1HOCko8aa	as long as your going to a good dental office who has a good dentist..  you should be fine. the shot doesnt really hurt that much. you shouldnt look. you should probably close your eyes or put your focus on something else.|`|3b9a6e79ee30cd0d6e0e9a57fca9c99eaa	I don't remember the number of shots given. But they will put a numbing gel on first to numb before they give you the shots. The shots only hurt a little. I concentrate on my breathing. I count to myself(10) as I am inhaling. Then I do the same thing as I exhale. Before you know it they are done and you wait for about 10-15 minutes (depending on the anesthesia) and you feel numb to your ribs.(just kidding).  Basically I got through the shots, because I sure didn't want to feel them taking the tooth out. After you are numb you will feel pressure and movement but no real pain.  Good luck!|`|lJ2XG0QMaa	I had all 4 wisdom teeth pulled and I was wide awake too. Its not that bad, I find it cute that you arew sc ared for the little needle part and not the whole yanking your teeth out! I myself would be scared for the tooth part. Just tell your dentist that you are really really scared of the needle, he knows how to deal with that cause its his job. If he is good he will give you a cotton swab of numbing gel BEFORE the needle this will partially numb you so the needle will not hurt!! And if he waits a few seconds before the 2nd needle shot then you are already more numb! Just ask him nicely, he can make it easier to deal with. He only does it a million times a day.  Best of luck!|`|dIeFRMdnaa	hey:)    yes i understand why you would be scared, i had two of my teeth pulled not that long ago too, but after it was all done, it really wasn't even all that bad if you want the truth^_^    =D okay so here's what they do: they'll give you a numbing shot around the area where that specific tooth is to be pulled and you don't even feel the shot. lol when they did it to me i didn't even know they began. but anyways after that they'll let you sit there for a few minutes so it can fully numb your tooth(don't worry, they won't pull it till they know for sure it is numbed, they usually test it out by pinching it or something and you tell them if you feel anything). You'll probably get something like a shot per tooth to be pulled because it becomes very strong in your teeth, so it usually only needs one per tooth. So after that, they take a smallish pair of pliers and just pull it right out. but you wanna know the best part? you don't feel a thing!! i swear:) although it is just like a bunch of pressure on your tooth, not too bad though.     afterwards is the worst part though:( your mouth is really numb and your whole face feels swollen(but it's really not^o^). The swelling goes down in time though:) it will also feel weird for a while because you have that tooth that used to be there replaced with a big hole, but you'll get used to that too. plus it doesn't take that long to grow back=D    The last bit of advice I have for you is when you first get done, bite on a towel or something absorbent, and it probably wouldn't hurt to carry around some type of bowel because your mouth will be bleeding a lot and your face will be so numb so you drool a little.     But when it's all finished in the end, it's not terrible at all. I'm sure in the long run it's completely worth it too^_^    Well good luck:)!!!

Hope this helps.|`|aOmDuXubaa	You have a form of sciatica.  You probably hurt your back or tweaked it at one time and now it's causing you problems.  What happens is that the muscles in your core (hips, thighs, buttocks, lower back) spasm and get knotted.  When this happens they pull your pelvis and spine out of alignment.  What I did to stop my problems is to start doing inversion therapy or hang upside down with gravity boots.  As you invert the muscles of your abs are stretched and the knots are broken up.  As this happens they release their grip on the muscles in your hips and thighs.  As they loosen they will release their grip on the muscles in your lower back.  As this happens they in turn release their grip on your pelvis and lower spine and allow it to go back into alignment naturally with gravity.  When your spine and pelvis are out of alignment it effects the sciatic nerve and that's what's causing your pain.  I guarantee if you try inversion therapy within a week or so your pain will be gone.  Here's a good site to read about what I'm talking about.  Hope this helps.
z5JkgFOyaa	Abdominal/pelvic pain that is similar to that of period cramping may indicate a problem in a reproductive organ (like the pain around your ovaries or uterus).     This includes conditions such as endometriosis (when tissue from the uterus is displaced to somewhere else like the pelvic wall or ovaries), uterine fibroids (thick bands of muscular and fibrous tissue in the uterus), ovarian cysts, ovarian cancer (rare), or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) infection of the reproductive organs, usually from a sexually transmitted disease.    If you have pain in your ovary area, you might have an ovarian cyst. I have experienced that same type of pain whenever I have had an ovarian cyst. I was also diagnosed with endometriosis in 2007 which caused me severe pelvic pain and intense and painful period cramping.    It could also be that you have ovulated and had some ovulation pain, which typically lasts no longer than 24 hours.    If a gynaecological reason cannot be found for the pain you are experiencing, then it could be a gastroenterology problem which could be caused by excessive gas, chronic constipation, viral gastroenteritis (stomach flu), IBS (Irritable bowel syndrome), heartburn or indigestion, gastroesophageal reflux, ulcers, cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) with or without gallstones, appendicitis (inflammation of the appendix), diverticular disease, including inflammation of small pouches that form in the large intestines (diverticulitis), bowel obstruction (in addition to pain, this causes nausea, bloating, vomiting, and inability to pass gas or stool), food allergies, food poisoning (salmonella, shigella), hernia, kidney stones, UTIs (urinary tract infections), pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) or dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm (bleeding into the wall of the aorta).    Based on your symptoms and what you wrote, I would recommend that if you continue to experience this pain that you should see your doctor/gynaecologist, and if nothing is found that you see a gastroenterologist just to rule out any serious GI causes.    Good luck :)
3b687116ebd91e437816db8e4f34fb0eaa	I was just in the ER for 3 days because I keep having pseudo-seizures. I went blind as usual but wouldn't convulse. They said there is nothing they can do for me and sent me home. I hate epilepsy.    After the blindness I slept for hours.|`|GO7tZtPxaa	Yes Im sure that it is possible to have the feeling that you are going to have a seizure without having one, however be carefull as this may mean that one is one the way!    Hope youre ok.|`|jtoxFsdYaa	Yes it is. I have suffered from them for many years. They are a mild form of Epilepsy known as Petit Mal ( French for small sickness) as opposed to full blown seizures that are known as Grand Mal.    Although I am able to control mine and an EEG found no problems, I would still suggest that you see your doctor just in case they are symptoms of a more serious problem.|`|6JnAOYCYaa	Hello    Yes, it's the same with Migraine auras.     Sadhara
tdN2ouxAaa	You can't.    Surgery won't even get rid of them instantly!    If I'm wrong, let me know, PLEASE.|`|Dhz4XgQ3aa	You cant hun.  You should use vitamin E cream twice a day in the morning and in the evening. Or Bio oil.   You can also buy special more expensive cream online. Sephora for US or lookfantastic.com for UK are good places too look.     xx|`|7i6qj4OXaa	You can't get rid of them either instantly or long-term.  They don't go away.  They may fade slightly over the years but that's all.|`|cYsPx9sSaa	theres no overnight cure, try palmers cocoa butter|`|PbNa0akOaa	I don't believe you can get rid of them INSTANTLY, not unless you use make up or something? Not sure how effective that would be. You can get body oil that help with stretch mark but it takes time.|`|IotJ5Y5waa	Magic Marker.Sorry.|`|No16LnAqaa	if there was a way i wish i knew it!  i have them really badly on my thighs, but i've been using bio oil, which works really well because it's nice and greasy, although it's quite pricey i would say it's worth it.  also try using a body scrub in the shower as it helps the circulation and in turn will help fade out the stretch marks.  hope this helps  most women have them so don't worry =D|`|qSnF1jseaa	go to lala land and ask the fairy to cure you! nothing works insantly vitamin E and other lotions work over time..|`|8aA1HWA1aa	You actually cant get ride of stretch marks as quick as that hun but bio oil is really good!! if you don't want to fork out for that then coco body butter is a good alternative! I use bio oil and it works wonders!  All you need to do is massage it in to the stretch marks in a circulatory motion AT LEAST once a day, twice if possible. This should reduce the look of them if you stick to it hun! it wont happen over night but you will notice a difference in a few weeks or so! Good Luck! Hope this helps!|`|JHRqYs3Raa	coco butter
b0faTDlJaa	Unfortunately in some cases yes. You should be alright in blue collar work. You could always where a turtle neck to the interview then unvail it the suprise later when its too late.|`|lcRbG4Csaa	Dude, big decision, I am heavily inked but I can hide everything. The type of job I do requires me to look very "straight", and people will react to you differently when they see ink. If your not independently wealthy or gonna be a tattooist or drug dealer forever, you might wanna rethink, if i was any one of the three mentioned though I would go with the Moko..|`|M6fzLJtmaa	Yea as sick as a neck tat looks i would say NO. I work at a Jr. high and i keep all mine hidden. Just think when people first see you,  no matter how qualified you are, do you really think they want someone with neck tats to represent their company. I would reconsider and get your ribs done that's a rad place to get tattooed. I went trough the same question myself and I'm glad my tattoo artist refused to ink up my neck.  Just my two cents
rpnFxnCQaa	Incense smoke contains various contaminants including gaseous pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and adsorbed toxic pollutants ([[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] and toxic metals).     On the other hand, Frankincense incense has been shown to cause antidepressive behavior in mice. It activated the poorly understood ion channels in brain to alleviate anxiety and depression.    I guess it is just like anything else: use it with moderation.
2e103842ea492d6dca1571e0a0df8befaa	you should go see a doctor. it could be hormonal.|`|AEAxZEveaa	If it's that low, you need to go to the hospital.|`|V44ghQJgaa	An abnormally low body temperature (hypothermia) can be serious, even life-threatening. Low body temperature may occur from cold exposure, shock, alcohol or drug use, or certain metabolic disorders, such as diabetes or hypothyroidism. A low body temperature may also be present with an infection, particularly in newborns, older adults, or people who are frail. An overwhelming infection, such as sepsis, may also cause an abnormally low body temperature.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	39 degrees centigrade is 102 Fahrenheit, not 95 Fahrenheit. I think that you have confused a few people with your miscalculation. 95 is a low temperature, below normal, 102 is a low grade fever as you describe.
z5AahDilaa	did you get a bug bite? or a sting? maybe you did when you where sleeping a bug bit you, but to know for sure look at your toe and look for a little tiny red dot in the middle of all the redness. try soaking it in some hot epson salt water. if it gets to bad go see a doctor. hey.....maybe you have pink toe! like pink eye but on your toe lol. good luck. :) also put neosporin cream on it.
U1R87Ec0aa	There are a few things this could be.  It could be allergies.  In that case an anti-histamine should help with the itching.  It could be a physical manifestation of stress.  If you are stressed and have no other way to deal with it, you may begin some coping behavior (such as itching).  It could also be a skin infection.  If you have a cut on your foot or leg, it may have become infected which can cause a skin infection.  So, there are many different options.  If it is stress related you will need to find an outlet for the stress.  If it is a skin infection, you will need to see a doctor for a cream that will clear the infection.  I hope this helps.  Good luck.|`|Z0GfGZtJaa	Change your body cleanser. Rinse yourself well. Clean your bed linen. spray your mattress with lysol.  You could try a anti-fungal OTC med.|`|15c5fa301c0c52ece10d7622a94fbc10aa	Psoriasis cure (SEVERE DRY/RED ITCHY SKIN)-Get a bottle of Doo Gro -doo gro is a brand of ALL NATURAL hair product that targets women of color who have hair that won't grow. found in the hair isle in most dept stores (Sally Beauty Supply) - weird but REALLY works on the skin! also do not use Ivory soaps - use Dove unscented products! I saw FAST results! -cut out junk food-drink water|`|KbXN4nuQaa	IDK UR NOT CLEAN?|`|8te6mUHIaa	mostly these happen in the winter, when your skin is dry and irritable.  you should apply lotion on you everyday o.o|`|DTBbQbfLaa	take a shower...|`|EjyD1sXeaa	it could be a fungal infection that you could clear up with canesten cream or go see your doctor|`|uOrzoecPaa	ya, or it could be dry skin|`|Bctc0cEEaa	it's just dry skin because of the weather, put some lotion on, cocoa butter lotion works best|`|BxW2Lj7waa	Talk to a dermatologist if it happens each year, or a doctor.|`|IQXnS893aa	take a shower and apply lotion|`|AA11285538	Have you taken antibiotics lately?  That's exactly what they do to me.|`|wOytdKEQaa	There is a possibility it is allergies.    What I would do is carry around some Benadryl or other equivalent anti-itch cream, and just apply it liberally when you get an itch. Also, I know this will sound a little gross, but if you can't get away to put any of the anti-itch cream on, you could always gently lick your fingertips and apply it to the itch instead of scratching. You could also use water for this instead of your own saliva if it freaks you out too much.|`|tqMi1Iefaa	Check what you are eating that is seasonal.  Same thing happened to my son, turned out to be strawberries.|`|GTCMey75aa	well other than the fact you get them every year it sounds like scabies whcih is micro mites under the skin lotion wont cure the itch and you have to get this special cream from a docter, they usually start on the feet, ankel, legs and work up the rest of the body, if you go under a black light and see a graysh pigment under your skin you have them , if not it might be exzema. good luck|`|RKO3S2Fiaa	probrably.  my little brother gets them occasionally on his back.  we just give him some allergy medicine such as benadryl.|`|jEyrgPU3aa	try wearing different clothes. If that doesn't help, then It's probably allergies!|`|wmVBNzyoaa	well yes or no i think you should by a lotion and after ur baths or showers put it on your damp skin and right before you go to bed and when you wake up even in the winter wear sun screen you might be getting itchesares (skin itch)
I83sYbARaa	I am not an expert, but i would think so, but I dont know.... however since you probalby know by now that doctors dont have a cure for psoriasis, then you could research psoriasis cures in traditional chinese medicine.... because they can cure it.....       maybe you should just try a small section , first... you know|`|69SHxWA9aa	Why not get rid of the Psoriasis first, then not worry about it anymore?    Why not shave off the unwanted hair?    Here is how they are treating and curing Eczema and Psoriasis in Japan.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxLW-HKgQ...    You can get the water in the United States too - place a add in your local http://craigslist.com and place a wanted add for 8.5 PH alkaline drinking water. They can also make the 2.5 PH acidic water used in this video at the Hospital in Japan.    Drinking the alkaline water is one key, the other is the 2.5 PH water applied to the skin disease, and it will go away in around 5 months.    Good Luck !
o9p5kn1Baa	Im sure they give away condoms for free, but for the pill, i dont think so. otherwise everyone would be getting the pill for free from planned parenthood instead of paying each month thru their insurance. at planned parenthood, its about $20 a month, but you have to schedule an appointment to get it, and that appointment alone is $50|`|LMRaSXFeaa	yeah. i believe that you have to fill out paper work though.
E64juLwJaa	See your Dr.  Now,was that so hard to think of?  Planets|`|QXPVUxoDaa	That sucks  Maybe it's from having ruff sex, or just a lot of sex. If that's the case just get sum KY.

I would hot tail it to the clinic...   you have an STD..  good luck.....|`|ptGhiqe3aa	Definitely see a doctor right away.  It could be a yeast infection (yes, guys can get them too)  or a cyst?    But you say there are more than one, and I'm not too sure what that could be.    See a doctor as soon as you can about it.    Good Luck!|`|kgQK3bMlaa	You need to see a doctor probably a Venereologist (a doctor that knows about STD's)
f51d44e105a2a3f4397e420c549a4437aa	Cross trainers.  The were developed  expressly for gym type situations where you would be doing a variety of activities.  I would go to an athletic shoe store.
