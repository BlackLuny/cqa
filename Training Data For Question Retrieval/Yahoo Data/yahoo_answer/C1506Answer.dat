If they are talking about what church "A" did, people aren't focusing on church "B". It's like a magician. They draw attention to one hand so you don't pay attention to what the other hand is doing.<br>  <br>  2. because when you aren't fully informed about what the LDS church actually did, and what it meant, it can seem racist. And even all the explanation in the world, in todays society it won't explain away anything that wasn't considered completely politically correct and equal. But God isn't politically correct, so there is nothing that will be able to be said to some people to justify it. And that is something LDS members are just going to have to live with. And do our best to let people know the full story and put all the information out there about the church that shows just how un racist the church really was.

Come on, you can't tell me you don't see the difference...?<br>  <br>  And why is that racist?  Let's look at some proclamations from mormon "prophets" on the subject:<br>  (all of the ****'s below are where Y!A censored out  n e g r o)<br>  <br>  "Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African Race? If the White man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so." (Brigham Young, Journal of Discourses 10:110)<br>  <br>  "There is a reason why one man is born black and with other disadvantages, while another is born white with great advantages. The reason is that we once had an estate before we came here, and were obedient, more or less, to the laws that were given us there. Those who were faithful in all things there received greater blessings here, and those who were not faithful received less." (Joseph Fielding Smith, Doctrines of Salvation, p. 61)<br>  <br>  "Negroes in this life are denied the priesthood; under no circumstances can they hold this delegation of authority from the Almighty. The gospel message of salvation is not carried affirmatively to them... Negroes are not equal with other races where the receipt of certain spiritual blessings are concerned…" (Apostle Bruce R. McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, p. 343)<br>  <br>  ""No person having the least particle of ***** blood can hold the Priesthood" (Brigham Young). It does not matter if they are one-sixth ***** or one-hundred and sixth, the curse of no Priesthood is the same. If an individual who is entitled to the Priesthood marries a *****, the Lord has decreed that only spirits who are not eligible for the Priesthood will come to that marriage as children. To intermarry with a ***** is to forfeit a "Nation of Priesthood holders…<br>  "I think I have read enough to give you an idea of what the ***** is after. He is not just seeking the opportunity of sitting down in a cafe where white people eat. He isn't just trying to ride on the same streetcar or the same Pullman car with white people. It isn't that he just desires to go to the same theater as the white people. From this, and other interviews I have read, it appears that the ***** seeks absorption with the white race. He will not be satisfied until he achieves it by intermarriage. That is his objective and we must face it. <br>  Now we are generous with the *****. We are willing that the ***** have the highest education. I would be willing to let every ***** drive a Cadillac if they could afford it. I would be willing that they have all the advantages they can get out of life in the world. But let them enjoy these things among themselves. I think the Lord segregated the ***** and who is man to change that segregation? <br>  In spite of all he did in the pre-existent life, the Lord is willing, if the ***** accepts the gospel with real, sincere faith, and is really converted, to give him the blessings of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost. If that ***** is faithful all his days, he can and will enter the celestial kingdom. He will go there as a servant, but he will get celestial glory." (Apostle Mark E. Peterson, Race Problems - As They Affect The Church, Convention of Teachers of Religion on the College Level, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, August 27, 1954)<br>  <br>  Do you really wonder why the church is considered racist?  <br>  Please.

There were blacks that held the priesthood. Although Wikipedia I have to admit is a poor source to find info it states: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacks_and_the_Latter_Day_Saint_movement#Missouri_era_.28early_1830s_to_1838.29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacks_and_...</a><br>  <br>  The Church never denied membership based on race (although slaves had to have their master's permission to be baptized), and several black men were ordained to the priesthood during Joseph Smith's lifetime. The first known black Latter-day Saint was "Black Pete", who joined the Church in Kirtland, Ohio, and there is some evidence that he held the LDS priesthood.[4] Other African Americans, including Elijah Abel in 1832, Joseph T. Ball in 1835 or 1836 (who also presided over the Boston Branch from 1844-1845), and Walker Lewis in 1843 (and probably his son, Enoch Lovejoy Lewis), were ordained to the priesthood during Smith's lifetime.[5] William McCary was ordained in Nauvoo in 1846 by Apostle Orson Hyde.[6] Two of the descendants of Elijah Abel were also ordained Elders, and two other black men, Samuel Chambers and Edward Leggroan, were ordained Deacons.[7]<br>  <br>  Early black members in the Church were admitted to the temple in Kirtland, Ohio, where Elijah Abel received the ritual of washing and anointing (see Journal of Zebedee Coltrin). Abel also participated in at least two baptisms for the dead in Nauvoo, Illinois, as did Elder Joseph T. Ball.<br>  ***<br>  <br>  Beginning in 1842 , [Joseph] Smith made known his increasingly strong anti-slavery position. In March 1842 , he began studying some abolitionist literature, and stated, "it makes my blood boil within me to reflect upon the injustice, cruelty, and oppression of the rulers of the people. When will these things cease to be, and the Constitution and the laws again bear rule?" (History of the Church, 4:544).<br>  <br>  On February 7, 1844, Joseph Smith wrote his views as a candidate for president of the United States. The anti-slavery plank of his platform called for a gradual end to slavery by the year 1850 . His plan called for the government to buy the freedom of slaves using money from the sale of public lands.<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyway this is  part of how Joseph Smith saw the issue. Do I think some of the members and leaders of the Church were possibly racist, quite possibly. But so were a lot of churches at this time. The thing is our church never segregated our congregations like so many other churches did.

9iq0WnGYaa	why is it their business? did they know about your dating life before your husband? why should they know about it afterwards? you're 30 years old and you're smart enough to tell whether or not this would settle well with your parents. some parents are indifferent and fully supportive, and others will shun you forever. it's just the sad reality of this new "coming out" generation. i just never understand why grown adults feel the need to share everything about their private or sexual lives with their parents. if you're extremely close to them and have the type of relationship where you share everything with each other, try waiting a WHILE or letting them slowly figure it out on their own. a lot of the time parents will know, but they feel more comfortable with a "don't ask don't tell" basis. but when you drop a bomb on them, they can react very irrationally, ESPECIALLY if they're religious. i don't know your dad, but i know that a lot of parents feel more comfortable if they're not put in the situation where they have to tell you how disappointed they are in you, because a lot of the time, they feel obligated to. and yes, it will hurt, because your dad's generation is probably NOT going to suddenly be open-minded or rational in their thinking anytime soon. so i would say that your best bet is to just enjoy what you have with this woman. and if you don't live with your parents, thats the most ideal situation. don't EVER feel guilty for having a gay relationship. THEY'RE the one's that should feel guilty that their own daughter is having a hard time telling them about something that is making her genuinely happy.|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	It's not the first time I've heard of this.

I'm also 30 and working on coming out of the closet. My case might be a little different in that my marriage officially broke apart because I found out my husband was cheating. Can't say I blame him, though if you know what I mean. In any case, I was thankful because I knew I wasn't happy with the marriage. My parents aren't making gay comments any more. I think they suspect, even though I don't have a girlfriend. One friend I'm always talking to was the first out lesbian from my class in high school. Another friend I'm always with, well, we always going to the bar or out for dinner after work. I'm pretty sure my mom thought we were dating at one point, but we never were. <br>  As for telling your parents, you have to do it in your own way and on your own terms. Drop me an email if you ever wanna chat. Good luck.<br>  <br>  I'm not speaking for the asker here, but I will eventually tell my parents because I'm tired of lying to them. I'm tired of the "don't ask, don't tell" and I want to be able to bring any future girlfriends over to their house for family functions. I'm not going to hide my girlfriend in a closet just because it makes them feel uncomfortable. Further more, I have a son who will tell them what is going on in my dating life as soon as he knows anything anyway. It will be better for me to be upfront with who I'm dating. So, to those who ask "Why do you have say?" I have to say, so that I can live my life the way I want and not hide things from my family!

Hicks.<br>  “The basic doctrine of tongue speaking is unscriptural and wrong,” contends Dr. W. A. Criswell of the First Baptist Church of Dallas. He adds: “If that is the Christian faith, then I am not a Christian.”<br>  In the face of such controversy over the practice of speaking in tongues, you may wonder: ‘Just what do the Scriptures say about the gift of tongues? Is it part of Christianity today?’ For the answers, it is helpful to understand why the gift of tongues was given to the early Christians.<br>  WHY THE GIFT WAS GIVEN<br>  First of all, the apostle Paul explains at Hebrews 2:2-4 that the miraculous gifts, which would include the gift of tongues, were given to the first-century Christians to verify that God’s favor had shifted from the old Jewish arrangement for worship to the newly established Christian congregation. The shift of divine favor was well established by the latter part of the first century, while some of the apostles of Jesus Christ were yet alive.<br>  That the gift of tongues also served another purpose can be seen from Jesus’ words to his disciples shortly before his ascension to heaven in 33 C.E. He said: “You will receive power when the holy spirit arrives upon you, and you will be witnesses of me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the most distant part of the earth.” (Acts 1:8) The small group of disciples did not include persons who spoke the languages of every part of the earth. But, true to Jesus’ promise, about 10 days later, on the festival day of Pentecost, the holy spirit was poured out on about 120 of his disciples gathered in an upper room in Jerusalem. The result? They “started to speak with different tongues” and so could proceed immediately to carry out the assigned work of witnessing.—Acts 2:1-4.<br>  When those disciples gave a witness in Jerusalem at the festival of Pentecost, Jews and proselytes who had come from faraway places for the festival were heard to say: “How is it we are hearing, each one of us, his own language in which we were born? . . . we hear them speaking in our tongues about the magnificent things of God.” (Acts 2:8-11) It is obvious that the tongues mentioned here were known languages, not unintelligible speech. And notice that the gift was used in harmony with the purpose for which Jesus said the spirit would be given, namely, to witness to others. It notably served that purpose, for “on that day about three thousand souls were added.”—Acts 2:41.<br>  Another instance when the outpouring of holy spirit was accompanied by the gift of tongues is reported on at Acts 10:44-46. If you read the account you will notice that when God’s spirit fell upon the Gentile Cornelius and his household, they, too, began “speaking with tongues.” Commenting on what he had observed on that occasion, the apostle Peter said: “But when I started to speak, the holy spirit fell upon them just as it did also upon us in the beginning.” So, according to Peter, the gift of tongues bestowed on that occasion was the same gift received several years previously at Pentecost—a miraculous ability to speak foreign languages. The Bible shows that the gift of tongues given to Cornelius and his household convinced Peter and those with him that God was now accepting uncircumcised Gentiles into the congregation. God was now using the Christian congregation.—Acts 11:15-18.<br>  ‘But how do you explain Paul’s words at 1 Corinthians 14:2?’ some ask. ‘Did not Paul say, “For he that speaks in a tongue speaks, not to men, but to God”?’<br>  First of all, it should be noted that Paul is not here discussing private prayer but, rather, the use of the gift of tongues at a congregational meeting. (See 1 Corinthians 14:23.) Moreover, Paul’s words are in complete harmony with both the purpose for which the gift of tongues was given and the description of the gift given in the book of Acts. If you read the entire 14th chapter of 1?Corinthians, you will notice that (1) the tongues referred to were known languages, not unintelligible speech, and (2) the gift was to be used, not privately, but for the benefit of unbelievers.<br>  Let us read verse 2 in its entirety. It states: “For he that speaks in a tongue speaks, not to men, but to God, for no one listens, but he speaks sacred secrets by the spirit.” The Greek word translated “tongue,” glōssa, is the same word as that used at Acts 2:4, 11, where it obviously has reference to known languages. The Greek word translated “listens” can denote hearing something without understanding what is stated. This can be better understood in the light of verses 13, 16 and 17 of 1 Corinthians, chapter 14, where we read: “Therefore let the one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may translate.

The gift of tongues described in the NT is that the speaker was understood by listeners who did not know the speaker's native language.  Glossalia as practiced in the Pentacostal Church in particular, and the wider charismatic movement, is non-distinct gibberish composed of syllybles from the speaker's native language arranged in non-structured formats or in completely repetitious formats which do not indicate any form of language.<br>  <br>  As the Gift of Tongues is presented Biblically, you would not even know the Gift was in place unless you verified it with someone else who spoke another language, because it is presented as if the listener hears the speaker in the listener's native language.  How then, would you know the Gift was in place, if you did not verify with another person who spoke another language natively, that multiple people were hearing the speaker clearly in multiple languages?|`|212F2EO0aa	They believe and practice the spiritual gifts in the Book of Acts.<br>  <br>  Some, believe that gifts are evidence of being saved...and/or baptized by the Holy Ghost.<br>  <br>  They believe in works retaining your salvation.......not once saved, always saved.<br>  <br>  I would never doubt the ability of the Holy Ghost, but God bestows His gifts as He wills, not what we desire.<br>  <br>  I have many friends who attend Charismatic churches, even though I disagree with parts of their theology.|`|bI3areCsaa	Because it all started on the Day of Pentecost.It's in Acts 2,so it isn't unscriptual or  wrong.No where in the Bible does it speak against it.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	It is just a crazy demonstration put on for the benefit of the congregation and the preacher.|`|v0BCIQpnaa	Because we can.<br>  <br>  Bri|`|A6dKo6O4aa	Because they are too stupid to speak in a language that the rest of us can understand.|`|AA12045802	They want to scare people away.|`|Ve18FAnGaa	its easier then speaking in feet?

iPNOVR6Gaa	Two points: <br>  <br>  1. Catholics don't worship their statuary.  They do not pray to the images.  If they happen to be looking toward a carving of Christ on the cross while praying, they are not praying to the carving, but to He who it represents.  Get a dictionary and look up "idol" and maybe you'll understand this.<br>  <br>  2. This question has nothing whatsoever to do with Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered, so why did you post it here?  Weird!|`|yQNit56Qaa	1) well, my parents go to church but the priest does not teach ANYTHING that's on the bible<br>  <br>  This makes me think that you have not actually attended a Roman Catholic religious service.  I have, and in my admittedly limited experience (I've only attended a couple dozen different Christian religious services), the Roman Catholics read more from Scripture during service than any other sect (except *perhaps* the Episcopalians, who are about equal).  I happen to know that this is a standard practice in Roman Catholic services - it was not something particular to the church that I attended.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) when i was younger i was catholic, and i asked the priest about a question i had, well he didn't answer me. he said that the bible was only meant to be read by religious leaders and that we must only listen to them.<br>  <br>  In my (again, limited) experience, that is an *extremely* unusual response.  I have done some research into Roman Catholic beliefs, and at *least* since the middle of the 19th century, reading the bible has been encouraged by the Roman Catholic Church.  In the early 20th century, a fairly significant effort was made, by official (papal) decree, to encourage Roman Catholics to read the bible.  I think this particular priest you mention was advising you in a manner contrary to official Roman Catholic doctrine.<br>  <br>  <br>  3) now that i'm in another religion, i'm finding a lot of stuff that catholics do that is not in the bible.<br>  and i want your input on this.<br>  <br>  Well, here's my *general* stance.  First, I am a Fundamentalist Christian.  Nevertheless, it is not reasonable to forget that the first Christians - the Christians we admire most highly - did stuff that was not in any bible or any Scripture.  There are religious practices recorded in New Testament Scripture (such as the surrogate baptism for the dead) that nearly all Christians do not practice today.  My point is:  there is lots of stuff that Catholics do that is not in the bible because at one time *everything* that Christians did was not in the bible, because for the first 300 or so years of Christianity there *was* no bible.  Christianity is **not** based on the bible.  The bible is a useful source for the formation of doctrine - I believe that it is the foremost modern source - but it is not the *only* source, and for several centuries it was *not* available for the formation of Christian doctrine.  During that period (and afterward) Christian doctrine was decided as we see in Acts 15 and by the "passing down" (orally) of the teachings of Jesus and the apostles.<br>  <br>  <br>  4) have any of you ever asked a priest why you guys worship images?<br>  <br>  Now I suspect that you are misleading us about your upbringing.  Official Roman Catholic doctrine specifically prohibits Roman Catholics from worshiping images of any sort.<br>  <br>  <br>  5) what do you think of the scripture above?<br>  <br>  I am "leery" of Roman Catholic statues (well, more:  the praying for intercession).  However, the verse you mention is clearly taken out of context.  Notice, for example, how God instructs Moses - in the very same book - to construct the holiest artifact ever known.  This is the ark of the covenant.  God instructs Moses to mount two images of cherubim on the "mercy seat" (the lid) of this most holy artifact, so holy that  - generally - only the high priest was permitted in its presence.<br>  <br>  Now, if your quote means "no images ever" - then how do you explain God ordering the use of images on the holiest object known to the Jews in the very same book?  This is a case that is *exactly* like "thou shalt not kill".  If we take that passage out of context, it means<br>  a) thou shalt not kill people - ever<br>  b) thou shalt not kill animals<br>  c) thou shalt not kill plants<br>  d) thou shalt not kill disease-carrying bacteria (which we do with antibiotics)<br>  <br>  NOW, if we read Exodus, we realize quickly that when God himself wrote "thou shalt not kill", what he meant was "thou shalt not murder".  Even the killing of other people is *expressly* permitted by God in the same book that says "thou shalt not kill".<br>  <br>  Similarly "thou shalt make no images", when the making of images  is *expressly* COMMANDED by God in the same book - and that intimately with the most important and sacred artifact used in the worship of that same God.  The passage here, clearly, means "do not make images for worshiping", just as "thou shalt not kill" means "do not murder anyone.  You can kill anything but a person, and you can only kill a person in war or as part of a legal execution."<br>  <br>  <br>  6) do you think the catholic religion follows the bible or man's rules?<br>  <br>  Both - as do all Christian sects.<br>  <br>  <br>  7) what do you think of priests who have admitted that they are atheists?<br>  <br>  That's what's known as an "oxymoron".<br>  <br>  <br>  8) and of all the things that priests are doing to innocent children?<br>  <br>  You mean, baptizing?  Teaching?  Something else?  You really should research this - compare the statistics on Roman Catholic officials convicted of pedo|`|Cpr6Ff5laa	definitely of all the sections to post this in, this is probably one of the worst, but people pick and choose what they like in religion. if they don't like things such as divorce, which is overlooked by the church even, and you're supposed to be stoned to death for cheating and stupid things like that, and you're going to hell, blah blah, no one listens to things like that for example<br>  <br>  the bible was created by ONE man, who used other BOOKS as REFERENCES, (bishop eusebius)  to please a king who wanted all the works of christianity in one book<br>  <br>  the book was written in their time, for their time, so it is extremely biased, mis intrepreted, and full of crap, go search up bible contradictions on google, and you will get TONS of pages where the bible contradicts itself, further proving it's flaws.<br>  <br>  i'm not saying religion is a bad thing, but it is for the weak.<br>  <br>  it's helped tons of people not commit suicide, change their lives, etc.. <br>  <br>  that's why i say it's for the weak, but i've outgrown my imaginary friends and their fairy tale rules.<br>  <br>  now im starting to rant, so i hope i helped.|`|AA12146958	The bible was written by man. You can read different versions of the bible. Catholics do not worship images as in something other than God. They have statues that represent God to them.  They are still worshipping God not the image.|`|BDSC8R3Aaa	You really were not taught anything about Catholicism. How sad<br>  <br>  I am not the best informed person to answer, but I shall do my best<br>  1 - We don't worship images. We worship ONLY the Lord God<br>  2 - The Church follows the Bible and the Tradition. Both are considered important ( by the way, the Tradition is NOT man's rules )<br>  3 - I don't know of any priest who has admitted to be atheist. If they are, they should leave the priesthood<br>  4 - About the children, well. That is more likely to happen within the children's family, teachers, etc.<br>  The unworthy priests, luckly, are a small minority. Sadly, it happens in any human group ( by the way, it has also happened in protestant denominations, but these don't get so much publicity )
08QtgdpOaa	I don't really have an opinion on this. Because on one hand, I understand why someone would do that. But on the other, they turned down an opportunity that could have lead somewhere.

The 'victim' doesnt have to be the weak one--the abuser can also be the weak one seeking to punish the strong one.|`|qTRzRi8gaa	I think it's just sort of like an intuitive thing.  That's how most people read other people.  It's not just like they have a checklist or list of things to look out for.  You just get a feel for someone and eventually a light-bulb just sort of goes off.  I think it's an unconscious thing.<br>  <br>  Often I find myself sensing weakness and I don't even go looking to find it. I imagine a person with an eye out for weakness to exploit would be a lot better at finding it.<br>  <br>  Not that I claim to be an expert.  It's just how I read people is generally entirely intuitive.  If someone asked me how I came to a conclusion or a judgment about someone, I wouldn't be able to say, a person just picks up 'vibes'.  In this case, it would be vibes of 'weakness'.<br>  <br>  So most likely, signs of people who look for assurance in other people.  They would be the easiest to manipulate.<br>  <br>  But it's likely not a conscious thing.  They probably just notice they can get away with certain things, with certain people.  And so, they push the boundaries of that and exploit that.<br>  <br>  But this is just my best guess.

For the first 40+ years of my life I tryed living the role society expected of me. I had 2 long term relationships as a guy. I treated both women very nice, married one and had a child with her. We divorced eventually, I had never really loved her. Two years later I met a woman that I loved with all my heart and treated like a princess. That lasted 5 years. <br>  <br>  With that back ground in place I had always been told I was a good looking guy but had no real confidence around women. I was born transsexual and tryed to live the role I was expected and that everyone assumed I was. A guy. It all started to make sense to me after I transitioned to my true self.  I had a look and reputation many women find attractive. To put it bluntly I looked like a bad a s s. I had a hard body from years of hard work, I was a very hard core biker that could back down most people with just a look. I was the typical hard a s s appearing guy that a lot of women like. Once both the women I had relationships got to know me  they found I was very gentle kind and loving. I would buy just because presents. I would listen to them and actually hear them. I was a nice guy that looked like a bad a s s.<br>  <br>  It occurred to me during transition and talking with my therapist. I had taken a job and life style that were so typical male that no one would suspect a thing about me. I was in very deep denial about my transsexualism. But once in a relationship I would treat the woman how I dreamed of a guy treating me if I had been born female.<br>  <br>  I think many women, including both  the ones I had relationships with were are attracted to the bad a s s look and hope to find the nice guy. In most case's however the guy that looks like a bad a s s is just that and they do not realize it until it is to late. Both my ex wife (now dececed) and my ex girl friend were in relationships after me with guys that had the bad a s s reputation, were very nice in the start and slowly became very abusive. Both had told me no guy had ever treated them like I had.<br>  <br>  Sorry this is so long but that is my perspective.|`|8DBGYlFhaa	Well for me, I really mean it when I say that I want a nice guy.

Old people die in abjact misery, starvation and extreme indignity, children are tortured, maimed and killed.  Whole nations are consumed under the tyranny of megalomaniacs who live comfortable and pleasurable lives.

AA11227341	in general, no! in the Christian household the woman--wife is subject to the man--husband.  God made woman for man.  Sadly, some so called Christian man abuse their position--forcing the wife to have sex when he has an urge--an erection, to be a pretty much a slave, gives her no word of judgment, sees the wife pretty much as just a vassal for his sexual needs.  <br>  However, if a man does these things, can he really be called a Christian?  Remember that we are known by our deeds.  <br>  So man should love their wife and have her by his side not near his feet.  for if one loves his wife, she will love him with all herself.|`|zPfgFXU5aa	It is "Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord," <br>  <br>  But the Bible also instructs, "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave Himself for it" (Ephesians 5:22,25). <br>  <br>  A man who under-stands that Jesus Christ sacrificed His life’s blood for the Church will likewise love his wife sacrificially and passionately. <br>  <br>  He will honor her, respect her, protect, love, and cherish her as much as he does his own body, as he is instructed to do (Ephesians 5:28). <br>  <br>  He will never say or do anything to harm or demean her. It is in this atmosphere of love and security that a godly wife willingly submits herself to the protective arms of her husband. <br>  <br>  She does this not because he is better than she is, but simply because this is God’s order for His creation.<br>  <br>  <br>  A godless world rejects the God-given formula to make marriage work. It thinks it knows best, and suffers the heartbreaking consequences of destroyed marriages and ruined lives. <br>  <br>  <br>  The Christian ideal of marriage is not one of an authoritarian and chauvinistic male holding his cringing wife in submission like an obedient dog. It’s the very opposite. <br>  <br>  While most of the great religions treat women as inferior to men, the Bible gives them a place of dignity, honor, and unspeakable worth, expressed so evidently in Proverbs 31.|`|91d4fbc3c75e4f7b862432c431187afcaa	In the garden of Eden, God made man & woman equal, But since the woman sinned, then God made the woman a little lower in authority then the man.

Lusting after her is a sin, whether you are a man or a woman.<br>  <br>  All sex outside of marriage is a sin, be it fornication, adultery, homosexuality, lesbianism or even simple lust or masturbation. There are no special categories.

We also have the Holy Spirit described as the 'comforter'.  The three are separate deities but they are all interconnected with each other.<br>  <br>  Just because Jesus is the son of God, does not mean He is NOT God.  Just because God is the Father of Jesus, does not mean He is NOT Jesus.|`|iAXmdQOEaa	I read those verses and those people were not demons.  It says that they had demons in them,  meaning....   they had ailments of some sort.   People in those times thought if there was something wrong with you, you had a demon in you.   They didnt know what epilepsy was or other ailments.   That's all it was.   <br>  <br>  Second,  Jesus is not God.  The scriptures tell us that all thru the bible.   People take the verses out of context and create religions out of it.  Hence the trinity.|`|k03dYskYaa	That proves Jesus is not God. <br>  The demons knew from their experience in the spirit realm that Jesus was not God. There is only one true God, Jehovah.<br>  James confirms this when he says "You believe there is one God, do you? You are doing quite well. And yet the demons believe and shudder." James 2;19.<br>  When Jesus died, the pagan Roman soldiers standing by knew enough to say that what they had heard from his followers must be right, not that Jesus was God, but that “certainly this was God’s Son.”—Matthew 27:54.|`|HGPxEhMSaa	The demons where the brothers of Jesus , even thought they chose the wrong path , they must have know exactly who & what Jesus was .

Not call him God?<br>  <br>  Why does someone call their father "dad" instead of "pops" or "father" or "old man" or "Homer"?<br>  <br>  <br>  2) Could it be they too understood that Jesus is not God ?<br>  <br>  It is possible that they did not realize that Jesus is God.  It seems unlikely, but it is certainly possible.<br>  <br>  However, to address your point:  there were people of that same time period who understood that the earth was flat, that bats were a type of bird, and that many animals procreated by means of spontaneous generation.  Understanding can be faulty - but the passage that you mention does not indicate that there was anything faulty in the understanding of the demons who addressed Jesus.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|wRBfUgI2aa	Most people were never taught that demons are angels who went bad.  Colossians 1:15-18 shows that Jesus was used by God to create the angels.

If you knew anything about Scripture and the Old Testament.|`|AA10945101	By the tradition of the time, calling someone the son of God was the same as saying they were God!  According to the tradition of the time, a son (especially the eldest son) had the rights of the father when he became an adult.  An adult son could speak for his father, enter into contracts in his father's name and much more.  A son was afforded all the privileges and honors due to the father and in a legal sense, the son was essentially the father.  <br>  <br>  By claiming to be the son of God, Jesus was basically laying claim to all the property, possessions, power and respect due to God. At one point Jesus said something along the lines of "if you've seen me, you've seen the father".  You may want to disagree that this was a claim to being God...and based on our modern rules of inheritance it may not make sense, but everyone who heard him say it knew exactly what he was saying...he was claiming to the birthright of God!|`|e4Mu7ci9aa	That is the way I read those scriptures , it would appear to me that the demon would know the difference between God & his son .<br>  This is one of the reasons I find Jesus is God in the flesh so hard to accept because if he was God in the flesh would they not have acknowledged Jesus as God , not the son . Would he still not have been God too them ?|`|AA10054998	Jesus was the son of G-d.  That was always something that He claimed to.  He was the "only begotten son."  However He is also G-d the Son; second person of the Godhead and the savior of all humanity.  I think you need to spend more time studying the Bible before you make claims about something that you obviously don't understand.|`|kE29abUUaa	Jesus never claimed to be God.<br>  Calling Jesus God is just of twisting of everything. The man never claimed he was a deity. He simply claimed to be a son of God. That's up to interpretation though. Since he could of meant that he was some sort of heir, or that everyone is the son or daughter of God.<br>  <br>  Saying Jesus is God is just a twisting of everything.<br>  <br>  If Jesus is a deity...<br>  Well, The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Three deities? That's polytheism, not monotheism. The belief in more than one deity.<br>  <br>  I'm really wondering how everything got warped around. I thought there was just one God, not three as many Christians say there are?|`|YOt6uTSzaa	My opinion:<br>  <br>  Before the appointed time...significant.<br>  <br>  Jesus the Son of God they would recognize....<br>  <br>  But Satan wanted nothing to do with Christ the risen Savior...it was not the appointed time......<br>  <br>  The death and Resurrection of Jesus the Christ who would show the world He was God born in the flesh that dwelt on earth and defeated satan by being the sacrifice for mans sin so that all may live, a redeemer to God and have eternal life.|`|91d4fbc3c75e4f7b862432c431187afcaa	Yes these demons knew that Jesus is the only begotten Son of God.

sxXoLSPxaa	forget it. hell aint half full.|`|Un3YxFvRaa	You can accept Jesus only if you recognize and exercise your gift of faith.  It is not something anyone can "sell" anyone on.  And, by the way, every religion in the world make absolute truth claims regarding the way to salvation…<br>  <br>  <br>  ? Christians proclaim that salvation comes by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. <br>  ? <br>  ? Hindus claim that salvation (liberation) is achieved when a person transcends this world of illusion by building up enough positive karma (good works) to escape the cycle of reincarnation. <br>  ? <br>  ? Muslims state that the possibility of salvation* results from submitting one’s life to Allah and faithfully carrying-out the Five Pillars of Islam.  (one of which is killing unbelievers)<br>  ? <br>  ? Buddhists say that salvation (Nirvana) is the result of detaching one’s self from the desires of the physical, material world. <br>  <br>  Each of the world’s religions claims to promote the true path to salvation, but each of these religions provides a distinct and contrary path from all of the others. Thus, one of these paths to salvation is true, or none of them are true, but they cannot all be true at the same time; this would be a violation of the Law of Non-Contradiction.|`|PYD9JyIzaa	faith comes by hear - hearing by the word of god - the best way to hear god's word is to go to church and hear his word being preached while u read along and don't be afraid to raise your hand and ask questions of that which u do not understand - peace be with u|`|RPd66ldYaa	Anyone can accept Jesus, even if you don't fully understand what you might be accepting. If you do accept him - if you are sincere in your prayer to him and in your heart - HE will change you.

We were PUNISHED by nuns for not using the right hand and use the hand of the devil.<br>  <br>  I am now ambidextrous (thanx to the nun's attempts to correct my devious ways), I still prefer my left hand.

There was a false idea that they were, and that is why the Latin word for left (sinister) came to mean evil. However, it doesn't matter if you are left or right handed.|`|FteB0LOraa	If we are all created equal, then what difference does it make? What happens if you have no arms? What if you were right handed and lost that arm? You would be forced to become left handed or learn to use your feet and I have seen a couple of people who can use their feet better that alot of people who have arms.
lJ2baVliaa	Jesus says... "Why do you ask me about what is good?" Jesus replied. "There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, obey the commandments." (Matthew 19:17<br>  <br>  John 14:15 - "If you love me, you will obey what I command."<br>  <br>  John 15:10 - "If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father's commands and remain in his love."<br>  <br>  1 John 2:3 - "We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands."<br>  <br>  1 John 3:24 - "Those who obey his commands live in him, and he in them. And this is how we know that he lives in us: We know it by the Spirit he gave us."<br>  <br>  Matthew 7:21-23 - "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'"<br>  <br>  James 2:14 - "What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?"<br>  <br>  James 2:18 - But someone will say, "You have faith; I have deeds." Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do."<br>  <br>  James 2:19 - "You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder "<br>  <br>  Matthew 7:16 - "By their fruit you will recognize them."<br>  <br>  I think the misconception is that if we believe we are saved no matter what we do... that is wrong.  The point is... if we are truly saved we will WANT to do good deeds and we WILL want to OBEY!! :)<br>  <br>  Those who do not produce good fruit are not of God, even if they think they are... as it says in Matthew 7:21-23<br>  <br>  EDIT: Daniel... the Scripture you are referring to may be: "Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.

k03dYskYaa	Jehovah's Witnesses.<br>  <br>  The Bible says: “This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments.” (1 John 5:3) Love for God moves people to respect the Bible’s moral standards. For instance, God’s Word has laws on sex and marriage. Sexual relations are permitted only within marriage, and marriage is to be permanent. (Matthew 19:9; Hebrews 13:4) When a woman in Spain who studied theology attended a meeting where Jehovah’s Witnesses were eagerly studying the Bible’s moral laws, she noted: “I left feeling upbuilt, not only by the enlightening Scriptural talks but also by the unity that exists among these people, their high morals, and their fine behavior.”|`|YQOT68xFaa	Nobody is perfect. There aren't a whole lot of people around whose lives give a true representation of Biblical Christianity. I suggest that, if you want to see what it is supposed to look like, you read your Bible and ask God to make your life that way.<br>  <br>  PS - tolerance isn't always the right thing. While we are not allowed to judge others and think ill of them because of sin, we also are not supposed to embrace sin and welcome and accept it. There is a balance that must be reached.|`|yQNit56Qaa	Well, two of those that you mention are not denominations at all.  A denomination, by definition, does not represent Christianity accurately, as a truly accurate representation of Christianity would be inclusive of all, or very nearly all, Christian denominations.  Read Acts for a "true representation of Christianity" by a "denomination".<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	Jesus preached. If you want to know which way to go, look to Jesus. If you find a denomination that goes too far away from what Jesus preached, you have a reason to doubt it. But like many of us, you will have to make up your own mind.<br>  <br>  I am not a part of any denomination. I see it as what Paul was talking about with the Corinthian church:<br>  1 Corinthians 3<br>   5 What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe—as the Lord has assigned to each his task.<br>  <br>  I think Christendom is guilty of doing just what Paul was referring to with the Corinthians. They have set upon themselves large doctrines to separate for themselves a 'congregation' that is trusting them to teach the truth; when God said He is the one to have the truth.<br>  <br>  So if a Christian church claims to follow after Christ as he is revealed in the Bible, then they have the same source I do for what the truth is in the written form. It's just that people are used to trusting with their eyes rather than with their spirit. So the intimacy with the spirit is lost for the sake of a dead person's doctrine.|`|IIhiSprlaa	None<br>  Catholicism seems to be the most loving in my opinion, but most crazies from offbeat churches will bash them and say otherwise|`|0kcOZxZMaa	All Religions were mans attempt to define God and his wishes and to further find mans place in Gods "Kingdom", for lack of a better word.<br>  <br>   Not one Religion I am aware of hit the nail on the head and Western views are silly to the point they are not viewed seriously by those with spritual intuition.<br>  <br>  Western Religions have butchered the idea of God by placing "God" as a being to be worshipped. God was viewed as angry and in sitting in judgment over mankind. Many in the West still cannot escape this idea. This view is largely external, God being "outside" of mankinds reach but by only a narrow alley man could transcend, IF, they "obeyed" certain laws written down (by other men).<br>  <br>  Eastern views are more internal. They place the concept of God within each to be discovered; yet, they also have idols to be worshipped.<br>  <br>  The western "Bible" was 40 books placed into one binding by vote of Constantine, Emperor of Rome. The councils of Trent,Nicea and Laodicea were commissioned by Constantine to come up with a book of refernce as he wanted to know Gods word plainly. <br>  <br>  In the end Constantine viewed many edits of his book and he chose a winner that was bound into the bible we see today. Of course we know Constantine was the first Roman Emperor to be converted to "Christianity" some 350 years after the symbolic (another story) crusifiction of the Christ. I say "the Christ" as Jesus Christ was not a personality incarnate but a symbolic model for mankind. Another story also.<br>  <br>  So, the bible editor was the Roman emperor named Constantine as he chose the book to be called the Christian word of God.<br>  <br>  With that said we have modern Christianity interpreting a book ( a group of 40 books actualy bound inmto one) approved of by Rome to interpret.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, no book is the true representation of Christianity as none are approved of by Rome as the Vatican has no authority over ancient Rome as Constantine himself is the sole authority by Roman law. <br>  <br>  Some can argue Constantine is dead and I counter argue that anyone whom wrote in the bible is also dead yet you follow that law that was approved by Constantine himself. The bible was a gathering of works by many and not of divine origin but of man-made interpretations alone.<br>  <br>  In regards to Chrstianity and the bible, find out what Constantine thought about the biblical works and this will be the new religion for the week...<br>  <br>  What is more important, Christanity does not represent the word of GOD at all and only interprets how man views God, which means we are largely unaware of God.<br>  <br>  Thomas Pain once wrote " believe in a cruel God makes a cruel man"...|`|x38Fb1UZaa	The Orthodox Church is evangelical, but not Protestant.

Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

And not that soft sweet stuff, I mean ripping the clothes off, primitive, partly painful mating.  We all like "off the wall" things.  That's why porn is a multi billion dollar industry.  You're good.  ^_^|`|631c8fd5c39d806e031079d8fccb75f9aa	As long as you're aware of other people's rights and feelings I think you're pretty normal.  This isn't an uncommon fantasy lol.<br>  <br>  Everything's a matter of degree, I think.  Anything between two consensual adult humans is okay, in my book.  Even if I don't like or understand it.|`|fc9205d542b3f8b1281ff1f85cc2e6f9aa	I like watching that too, even though I'm a gay man. I love seeing a woman dominating a hot straight guy.<br>  <br>  One porn had this girl put on a strap on and totally bang the guy. That was hot! And he liked it! <br>  <br>  We all have some type of porn that we secretly like. Some probably just like straight vanilla and others like something a little more extreme. But as long as it's all in good fun and nobody is forced (at least not in real life) then I think it's fine.|`|4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	That's one of the tamest fantasies out there I think I have ever seen, so that tells you something. :P It's fairly common.<br>  <br>  So, don't worry. You're perfectly normal.|`|b9082e593baa61d6020c92bab2fa8deaaa	As long as it feels good to you, it is normal.

AA10895799	If U believe in God and Jesus and U feel U R suffering from black magic, talk to yr parents again about it and ask them to take you to a large, conservative church, for safety reasons and have them pray for your release of evil spirits.  believers can do this themselves by pleading the Blood of Jesus and all problems will cease.|`|Aa6XHuENaa	I want to understand you.  Unfortunately, your writing is preventing me from doing that.<br>  <br>  Crazy people typically think that they're sane and that everyone around them is crazy.

If you want understanding in this matter, look for someone in Buddhism, Hinduism or a Wicca n. <br>  <br>  Go to a local spiritual store. Tell them of whats going on. I'm sure they will be happy to support you... and sell you things.|`|FteB0LOraa	It is very hard for me to believe in that invisible man that is living in the sky. I have always been told that he is there watching over everything, but I can't figure out why so much bad stuff happens if he is watching over us. If you are bad, you will go to hell and burn forever - But, He loves you. What's up with that? I guess it all leads to one question. Why are we here? I have found no answer yet and do the best I can at everything I do and if others think badly of me, then maybe they are wrong. Is there really a right or wrong? You can drive yourself crazy trying to figure all this stuff out. Just do what is best for you and do the best you can. Maybe you are right and the rest of the world is wrong. Just because the majority vote wins or rule's does not mean it is right.|`|u1qgyGFNaa	my mom doesnt believe in god, lol
SMHnpVraaa	That's normal in ANY relationship.  Everyone feels that way once in a while, i bet she feels the same way sometimes aswell.|`|EmN2dQg2aa	i think jealously to an extent is normal..but not when it consumes you. just remember that she chose you, shes with you. so whenever you think someone is checking her out or she is checking someone out, do something to remind her how great you are and why she did choose you, how proud you are to be with her etc. thats what i do.|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	It's normal. She's only human she's going to look.Im sure she has felt the same way. The thing is she's with you and not any of those other women. Just make sure you dont push her away. Because it can and does happen.|`|pjomniPGaa	Yes, it is normal. But you must trust her. Relationship needs to grow up with communication, understanding and trust. Have confident about your self. Believe in your positive sides that make you worthy.|`|C14muaIjaa	that is perfectly normal in any relationship.<br>  just try not to let your jellousy get the better of you becasue you wouldnt want it to destrooy a perfectly good relationship :)<br>  x<br>  Nadine|`|naqawnpJaa	yeah it is
SMHnpVraaa	If you are broken up and he is with someone else then there is nothing you can do.  If you aren't happy with your girlfriend try and end it nicely and find someone else.  It will take some time but eventually you will get over your ex, unless you two end up getting back together if he dumps his boyfriend.  But do not cheat, it isn't fair for your girlfriend and his boyfriend.|`|yQVAJQtzaa	Well, are you a closet gay and you're miserable with her?<br>  <br>  Or are you bisexual who happens to not be over his ex?<br>  <br>  If the first, break up and be happy.<br>  <br>  If the second, life sucks buddy, try to make the best of it.|`|b371fd5225e0f0948944cb7d323618b7aa	can't be mad at him when you are doing the same thing. jealousy is an ugly emotion.|`|fN4fpRntaa	i think you stated the answer to your own confusion, you're jealous of your ex-boyfriend having commenced a new relationship and obviously you still hold him near and dear if I'm not mistaken. do not get hung up on the fact you two are not together anymore, I suggest you take a confident stance and pursue to date another man... it will help you regain a sense of worth, which we all posses of course, just don't let it diminish from your control. if you're going out with a female, but also date men, don't you think it's a bit unfair not letting her know the circumstances? she is human too, and will get hurt, like you would if you found out you where being dated by a double dipper. i'm trying to be as supportive, but do make up your mind and then whatever complications you may face in the near future should disperse into the realm of "what used to be"|`|899c6a371bce238646502edb0cee925aaa	If you like the girl, then keep dating the girl and forget about your ex as much as you can.<br>  <br>  If you don't like the girl, then tell her you can't go out with her anymore.  I'm sure there are better things to occupy your time anyway.  I have a pet peeve for deception especially of this variety.|`|Jb5fQkQ1aa	ok honestly you don't love him if you did you would still be together. Second I think you don't want to fall in love with your girlfriend stop fighting your feelings for her and learn to get over him obviously he moved on it'll take sometime to heal the pain but I don't understand why you were with him in the first place if he was your best friend it must be propinquity affect that's all not love please stop confusing lust, and friendship as love and move on learn to love your girl. Stop playing with fire or you will get burn.|`|FBRQq5sBaa	Is it me? If it is then I will not date you I do not like other dudes pen15 the only pen15 I love in the world is mine own|`|tTWEiGSzaa	Um... firstly r u REALLY gay or straight. secondly, theres nothin u can do bud! just try and find someone u really love and not hide in the closet. thats the worst thing u can do!
7KF8nrEgaa	Well, I do know of a few girls that once liked men and because of their experience decided to become lesbians....but not very many.  You're motive is going to help you achieve, um, lesbian status.  Being a lesbian is more than kissing girls though, and if you're not attracted to the same equipment you have....well you won't like lesbian life.  I don't recommend trying it out either, because there's a lot of emotional, spiritual, and physical changes involved in it.  You could also risk breaking a real lesbian's heart and screwing it up for every bi chick out there.  I lost a lot of friends and family members when I broke out the closet, are you prepared for that?|`|spbqfjvbaa	The same way you become:<br>  The race you are<br>  Have your natural eye/hair color<br>  Become the height you are<br>  <br>  You don't become a lesbian.

You can choose to repress/try to change, but you're going to be who you are.|`|HCL7FpTqaa	practice licking carpet|`|8UnSNDPxaa	haha why do you want to??<br>  thats basically like asking how you can become black. gays and lesbians are born not made sorry.<br>  Its whatever you feel, you can call yourself a lesbian and have sex with women, but only you will know if you enjoy it.|`|usIma0vIaa	well you can't become that you have to be born with things.|`|899c6a371bce238646502edb0cee925aaa	You have to lick the carpet and chew on a box.|`|FBRQq5sBaa	It's pretty much like losing your virginity,<br>   It just....Happens|`|SMHnpVraaa	You cannot "become" a lesbian, you could be a lesbian but people are born the way they are.  You may be bi, or even bi-curious but that is it, you cannot change who you are.|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	Ummm...how can you become a lesbian....? It's not really something that you become. Are you straight? Why do you want to be a lesbian? The more you tell in your question the easier it is to get answers.|`|AA11672322	you can't really "become" one...<br>  you can be one...not become one...<br>  not unless theres this really great girl who just happened to pop into your life and....yea..you fall for her...maybe...|`|JwokyINXaa	Just simply become a lesbian If that's what you want|`|FEAT2Ovzaa	You already are.
UQTAN7cgaa	I know that freemasonry is NOT a religion.<br>  <br>  to some others:<br>  <br>  Tim H --- It is NOT a group of individual claiming power over the earth, where did come up with that? There is no pysical evidence of a link between the historic templars and freemasonry; freemasonry claims no linkage. freemasonry has never been interested in a NWO, nor was it involved with the illuminati. freemasonry does not ask people to join --- you answer is looking more and more like FICTION, it is not a cult... you have no idea what freemasonry is, do you???|`|fuujE5Peaa	Gee...did I miss the memo?  I'm supposed to be powerful and not a 9-5 schmuck in a cubicle writing software?  I better call the Grand Lodge to fix that (not).<br>  <br>  Definitely NOT a religion.  There are references to religion, as with any ancient society, but it is NOT a religion.  We are encouraged to research and study OUR OWN beliefs but are never told what to believe.  That's why there are Freemasons from every conceivable religion that believes in a supreme being.  <br>  <br>  The only almost exception is in the York Rite where you must profess to either be a Christian or, at least, willing to defend the Christian belief to progress to Knight Templar....but no particular "flavor" of Christianity it endorsed or required other than that.|`|F7YzHVyUaa	Not a religion.<br>  <br>  Tim H. needs to tighten his tinfoil hat.  Don't be so weak minded and easily influenced by pure crap that your hear some fool say.  Do a little research and find out for yourself what freemasonry is about.  You'll see that all of the things you say are untrue.  Stay away from the conspiracy websites and Coast to Coast AM if you are this easily influenced, they're full of nonsense.|`|YMUKmsdVaa	this group has deep religious beliefs and values.|`|53DHTn0jaa	I dont really know about them|`|SMHnpVraaa	I don't think cause I have no idea what that is.|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	It's a group of powerful indiviuals claiming right over the earth, originatng in Babylon, spreading to Europe throught the Knights Templar in the "holy" crusades and then to the americas in colonial times<br>  <br>  they want to overthrow all world governments and create a new world order, like the illuminati...... My dad was asked to join, he declined<br>  <br>  They are a cult, a treasonous group of powerful indiviudals, religion has to have belief in a power, not in a collective ethos or ethic, so it isnt a religion

hdFn4Dobaa	The name of Judas Iscariot is one that even today carries with it the stigma of betrayal and deception. Even in his introduction to us in Scripture he is referred to negatively"  ................. and Judas Iscariot, who later turned against Jesus' (Mark 3: 19 ). It is probable that this infamy did not come to him until after the betrayal of Jesus. He seem to hold a place of honor and respect as a member of the twelve. He was trusted enough that he was given the money box ( John 12: 6 ).<br>  <br>  This job of treasurer may be  contributing factor in Judas fall. He seems to had a problem with money. John tells us in John 12: 6,  that Judas " often stole from it.......<br>  <br>   It seems that the other disciples were unaware of it until after the fact. <br>  When Jesus sent him on his way to finish his work of betrayal, the disciples thought he was running an errand for Jesus ( John 13: 29 ). During supper when Jesus pointed out He was going to be betrayed, Judas was not suspected by the other disciples. On the contrary, they began to question whether or not themselves were the ones who would do such a thing ( Matthew 26: 25 ).<br>  <br>  What he did was seen by the desciples as an act so evil that it could only have been do through collusion with the Forces of Darkness ( Luke 22: 3 ). The betrayal was premeditated ( Luke 22: 4 ) , mercenary ( Matthew 26: 1 ), an designed to be performed in such away as not to incite the populace against he Jewish leaders and teachers of the Law ( Luke 22: 6 ). One of the things that made it particularly repulsive to the disciples was that the betrayal was initiated through a Kiss of a friend (Mark 14;: 45 ).<br>  <br>  Right after Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus, he realized the consequences of his betrayal would be for Jesus. He was so overcome with guilt and sadness, instead of repenting, as Peter had done after he denied Jesus 3- times ( Luke 22: 61 ) .<br>   Instead, Judas threw the money at the feet of those who had used him to get to Jesus an took his own life ( suicide ) ( Mathew 27: 5 ).<br>  <br>  Jesus' assessment of Judas was more to the point. He said, "The Son of Man will die just as the Scriptures say. But how terrible it will  for the person who hands the Son of Man over to be killed. It would be better for him if he had never been born." He ( Jesus ) spoke  of Judas as being a " devil "<br>  <br>  There had been some commentators who have tried to clean up the story by at least giving him a high and noble motive. Some say that he was trying to force Jesus' hand an cause Him to become more aggressive in establishing His Kingdom. Scripture does not appear to support such claim. The motivation that seems to have been driving him was simple greed.  Then one of the twelve  apostles, Judas Iscariot, went to talk to the leading priests. He said "  What will you pay me for giving Jesus to you?"<br>  <br>   And they gave him 30- silver coins. After that, Judas waited for the best time to turn Jesus in ( Matthew 26: 14 ). This seems to be in line the character of a thief. It is true, there could also have been anger over a continuing misunderstanding over the kind of Kingdom Jesus was bringing. Other disciples seemed to share in this confusion, even after the Resurrection of Jesus prior to Pentecost ( Acts 1:6 ). But to attribute this as a motive to Judas is pure speculation..........|`|rDI7EUVBaa	who the **** is this 'right wing' dude? he scares me, sounding like my grandfather.

I suspect it would be an end to religious tolerance.  This is exactly what happened in the early days of Christianity.  There were many conflicting gospels based on earlier oral traditions out there.  Eventually, a small group of Christians seized control and created the "One Church" or the Catholic Church.  They set about reviewing all of the gospels, and chose the ones that best supported their claims to power and wealth.  The others were deemed heretical and all copies they could find were burned.  It's possible they even edited the gospels they left in to make them more agreeable with each other.  I wonder sometimes if Mary Magdalen and Judas Iscariot weren't vilified to further suppress the teachings in their gospels.|`|inMO8g0vaa	Judas wasn't included because it didn't fit in with the doctrine that the counsel was trying to create.<br>  <br>  Most Christians forget that the canonization process wasn't simply to get an accurate bible, but to establish a unified doctrine, so they could rid themselves of the Gnostics and caprocrations once and for all.|`|MeFeazFiaa	Well th authors of the bibble picked, chose and invented what they wrote.

Someone being Christian does not mean that they are going to lead the country well. I personally felt that Obama was what this country needed to heal. We've destroyed America. He promised green jobs, alternative energy resources, and an end to the war. Preserving the environment was important to me and I think it's important to God, too, that we take care of the planet He created. All we've done so far is pillage the Earth's resources, taking and not giving anything back.<br>  <br>  I understand what Holy Flame means and I am totally against abortion, but at the same time, God gave us all the right to choose to do whatever we want to, even if it is wrong. Technically, isn't it a woman's right to choose whether or not she wants an abortion? Isn't Obama only protecting the right that God bestowed upon us?|`|hYQTOabRaa	John 17:16 "They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world."<br>  <br>  John 6:15 "Jesus, knowing they (the Jews) were about to seize him to make him king, withdrew again into the mountain all alone."  Later, he told the Roman governor: "My kingdom is no part of this world.  If my kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought that I should not be delivered up to the Jews. But, as it is, my kingdom is not from this source." - John 18:36<br>  <br>  James 4:4 "Adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy with God."<br>  <br>  1 John 5:19 "The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one." At John 14:30, Jesus reffered to Satan as being "the ruler of the world."<br>  <br>  Matthew 4:8-10 "Again the Devil took him along to an unusually high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory, and he said to him: "All these things I will give you if you fall down and do an act of worship to me." Then Jesus sad to him: "Go away, Satan! For it is written, 'It is with Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.'"  If the 'kingdoms of the world' did not belong to Satan he would have had no right to give them away and this would not have been a real temptation for Jesus.  Also, Jesus had no reason to except this offer because an earthly government is not his Father's purpose, his purpose is for a heavenly kingdom, "As you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.'" -Matthew 10:7<br>  <br>  If Satan is the ruler of this world then the politicians of this world actually serve him. Since, "No one can slave for two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and despise the other.  You cannot slave for God and for. . ." (Matthew 6:24), NO politicain who claims to be Christian is a true Christian. <br>  <br>  So, may I ask the real question:  <br>  Are you a Christian who voted?  <br>  If so, how do you reconcile that decision with the Word of God?|`|TzY9vkinaa	I sometimes wonder if they actually looked into his views, or if they just wanted the free ice cream.
FOzN3xwzaa	Matthew 7 is talking about false teachings.  The false prophets teach false teachings.  You are to examine what they SAY, not what they DO. <br>  <br>  Because what they DO, are the "right" things, but then they say false teachings.<br>  <br>  They do the right things, which is how they come in sheep's clothing.  They do the right things, so they look like sheep.  But then they start to teach, and they reveal themselves as FALSE TEACHERS. <br>  <br>  This is why you NEVER judge by outward appearance.  Outwardly, they look real.  You are  always to judge by DOCTRINE.<br>  <br>  And the only way you can judge their doctrine, is to study what is true doctrine yourself.  So you must know the Bible to do that!  Read the Bible every day.  :)  And be taught by good teachers that teach the Bible right.|`|hVVALFAPaa	You are not supposed to go out and do your good deeds and 'religious stuff' JUST so people will see how good you are and remark on it.

Having faith is 100 times more than just telling people you Christian, it's a loving heart and acts of kindness.<br>  <br>  In other words there is no reward in heaven for boasting that you are religious but are empty inside.

Meaning, don't pray, etc., in front of people just so that they see that you pray, etc. You are not to do this for recognition.<br>  <br>  Mat. 7:15-16 states exactly what it means. That not everyone that [appears] to be men of God, are. And that they may be leading one into evil, by using the very bible itself, to dupe Jesus' followers.<br>  <br>  These two verses are not contradicting, nor are they meant to go together. They are 2 completely different issues.|`|AA11100929	Matthew 6:1. Jesus is telling his disciples not to be like the Pharsiees and other men that would show a outwardly appearance of righteousness to gain fame or power. God counts individuals as righteous by their actions and heart condition. The key phrase is "noticed by them". <br>  <br>  God wants humble people, not people that get on a pulpit and try to put on a show to be "noticed by them". <br>  <br>  Matthew 7:15-16. Jesus is warning his followers that there would be many people that have a wicked heart, but outwardly, look like a sheep. Their "fruits" are their actions. Here is a scripture that will help you understand what these "fruits" consist of: <br>  <br>  Gal 5:22,23. On the other hand, the fruitage of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith,  mildness, self-control.<br>  <br>  Conclusion. Jesus is giving warnings of religious leaders that would be putting on a show and looked to be righteous or spirit led, but inside their "fruits" were wicked. <br>  <br>  Jesus wanted us to go preach about the kingdom, but to do it humbly. So Jesus wasnt being hypocritical, he was letting us know how to produce fine fruit and how to show your righteousness.|`|U4cYbkNQaa	I interpret the first verse as God doesnt want you to be in church to see what your neighbor has on, what car your friend drives to church, how much the person left in an offering, etc. You are to be in church for worship and nothing else. If you are there for man in the flesh, you should stay at home. The second I feel means there are people who seem to be of the lord, but are fake. They are there for the wrong reasons, and you should know what is true in their hearts. They arent living life for God, only gaining possessions by using his  good name.|`|uOwgkwTLaa	I believe what God was saying is this. Don't go forward preaching and practicing in His name by showing how great You are and with a "look at me, do as I do" attitude. As Servants of the Lord we must be humble, not weak,,humble(there is a difference) and put His reasons before ours. <br>  As for the second part, a lot of people strut around today with the notion that they are doing "God's works" but they do it in ways that are not of the Word of God. Usually putting themselves or their Ministry ahead of the Word and Will of God.<br>   Hope this helps some. God Bless You and have a Great day!|`|zhaHc4FAaa	1 [1-18] The sermon continues with a warning against doing good in order to be seen and gives three examples, almsgiving (Matthew 6:2-4), prayer (Matthew 6:5-15), and fasting (Matthew 6:16-18). In each, the conduct of the hypocrites (Matthew 6:2) is contrasted with that demanded of the disciples. The sayings about reward found here and elsewhere (Matthew 5:12, 46; 10:41-42) show that this is a genuine element of Christian moral exhortation. Possibly to underline the difference between the Christian idea of reward and that of the hypocrites, the evangelist uses two different Greek verbs to express the rewarding of the disciples and that of the hypocrites; in the latter case it is the verb apecho, a commercial term for giving a receipt for what has been paid in full (Matthew 6:2, 5, 16). <br>  <br>  <br>   [15-20] Christian disciples who claimed to speak in the name of God are called prophets (Matthew 7:15) in Matthew 10:41; Matthew 23:34. They were presumably an important group within the church of Matthew. As in the case of the Old Testament prophets, there were both true and false ones, and for Matthew the difference could be recognized by the quality of their deeds, the fruits (Matthew 7:16). The mention of fruits leads to the comparison with trees, some producing good fruit, others bad.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	He is talking about 'any' false teacher that Denies His Holy Deity like Cults!!|`|HBp5r76haa	You are missing the point: In Matthew 6:1 Jesus is talking about hypocrisy - He is warning His disciples not to behave like the Pharisees and the fathers of the Law, who wanted to pray loudly and publicly and only did deeds in order to have men's recognition. To them He says: 13"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to."<br>  <br>  But if your heart has been changed by the POWER of the Spirit of God, if your mind has been renewed with the things of the Kingdom and if you are a New Creation born from above, then you can't but "bear good fruits". So these fruits should be a manifestation of your salvation, and not a way to be saved.|`|89MKzLl3aa	There isn't a contradiction. Matthew 6:1 is referring to how the Pharisees are-hypocritical. Jesus despised  hypocrites, and referred to the Pharisees a lot in Scripture. If you are being righteous just for the recognition or for the "pat on the back", that is being proud and hypocritical.<br>  <br>  Matthew 7 means that we need to protect ourselves from those who teach false doctrine or whatever isn't in the bible or doesn't sound Christian.|`|14dc5a2caf80531c380c037d989d53edaa	The "key" to understanding the Bible is to always remember that Christ was always referring to the Soul of people, not their brains.... although since so few of those to whom he spoke were capable of comprehending his Spiritual references, he spoke to their brains as well.  All those who wrote the Bible comprehended was his speaking to the brain, and not his Spiritual message..... so the Bible is filled with references to the brain.<br>  <br>  Christ meant that to Love God one does so secretly and within ones "heart" not outwardly..... because doing so outwardly creates ego, which is an enemy of ones Spirituality.  Christ was constantly warning people about the war between the MIND [which is an agent of the negative power] and ones Soul which is easily overcome by ones "thinking"... which is of ones brain fed by ones MIND.<br>  <br>  So Christ said that one has to be very careful of those who preach of God but do so out of ego [sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves].  Christ also said do not throw your pearls [of wisdom] before swine.... do not speak of Spirituality to those who hate it and will despise you for speaking it.<br>  <br>  Many Christians misinterpret the Bible in some ways.  They do not get the quiet and inward nature of Spirituality, and try to shout it like beating a pan... just to appear as though they possess it.<br>  <br>  Lastly it is ones Soul that God loves, not ones physical body or brain.<br>  <br>  Peace|`|6354f9b17eeb910a803f8ef20a4505afaa	Often men want to be noticed for monetary rewards or for power or ego and that heart is not right when they practice being good to others in the sight of others.<br>  <br>  When being good to others because Christ says to be good to all is the right reason and the only reason.<br>  <br>  When we give to the poor and homeless on the corner, give as if you are giving to the Lord and don't worry about what the homeless man does with the money.  You've done what Christ said to do and you are only responsible for your actions and not the homeless man's actions.<br>  Give because Christ said to give.

AA11923447	Of course. I have many LDS (Mormon) friends, and they're good people. Same with my Muslim, Hindu, Pagan, Jewish, Buddhist and other friends and collegaues. I'm engaged to someone of a different religion. It's no big deal. All religions (save for the truly destructive sects) have good teachings in them. I have spent many years studying other beliefs and philosophies; in doing so, I have found many similarities between my beliefs (pacifism, social justice, tolerance, inclusion) and other other belief systems. The very idea that people of other faiths are being "led astray" or somehow in league with the devil is downright medieval. My beliefs are right for me, but they may not be right for others. There are different paths for a reason. I'm active in interfaith endeavors, and have learned a great deal from it.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	Sure.  So why don't I agree with them?  Because I've thought about what they believe, and it doesn't hold together.  Mormonism is easy, because it claims to be a Christian belief.  There is a simple way to check that out.  I just have to look at what historic Christianity teaches and compare it to Mormon doctrine.  For other faiths, I look at the questions religion answers:  origin, purpose, salvation/happiness, and the afterlife.  I am convinced that only Christianity gives coherent and self-consistent answers to all of these simultaneously.  I also compare the life and teaching of Jesus to that of their founders.  Last time I checked, only Jesus claimed to be God and was raised from the dead.  That seals the deal for me.<br>  <br>  peace|`|pfNnuD5saa	There is a common ground in all religion.

He has to allow the devil to tempt us, that is part of our free will.  He can't just come down and say "Yep, this is it", but we ARE entitled to personal revelation and THAT is how we can know for sure, what is right.<br>  <br>  I think people of all religions accept the truth that is presented to them.  The gospel encompasses all truth - no matter what it is about, the sun, science, night & day, whatever - so when a Christian goes to church and learns about Christ, they are being taught "some" truth.  When a person learns to be honest, that is some truth.  When a person learns to stay chaste until marriage, that is some truth.  We just believe ALL truth is contained in the LDS church, that all truth was restored when Christ and God came to Joseph Smith and instructed him on restoring the gospel.<br>  <br>  I asked my Christian friend if she could see any good in other churches and she said absolutely not.  She said the "you're wrong and I'm right" type thing.  Well, I can see how she might be blinded.

If we worship him in the right way, we will be happy and will avoid many problems in life. We will also have his blessing and his help. (Isaiah 48:17) There are, however, hundreds of religions that claim to teach the truth about God. Yet, they differ greatly in their teachings about who God is and what he expects of us.<br>  2 How can you know the right way to worship Jehovah? You do not have to study and compare the teachings of all the many religions. You need only learn what the Bible really teaches about true worship. To illustrate: In many lands, there is a problem with counterfeit money. If you were given the job of picking out such false money, how would you go about it? By memorizing every kind of counterfeit? No. Your time would be better spent if you studied real money. After you knew what real money looked like, you could recognize a counterfeit. Similarly, when we learn how to identify the true religion, we can recognize those religions that are false.<br>  3 It is important that we worship Jehovah in the way that he approves. Many people believe that all religions are pleasing to God, but the Bible does not teach that. It is not even enough just to claim to be a Christian. Jesus said: “Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will.” To have God’s approval, therefore, we must learn what God requires of us and do it. Jesus called those who do not do God’s will “workers of lawlessness.” (Matthew 7:21-23) Like counterfeit money, false religion has no real value. Even worse, such religion is actually harmful.<br>  4 Jehovah gives everyone on earth the opportunity to gain everlasting life. To have eternal life in Paradise, however, we must worship God properly and live now in a way that is acceptable to him. Sadly, many refuse to do so. That is why Jesus said: “Go in through the narrow gate; because broad and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are the ones going in through it; whereas narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are the ones finding it.” (Matthew 7:13,?14) True religion leads to everlasting life. False religion leads to destruction. Jehovah does not want any human to be destroyed, and that is why he is giving people everywhere an opportunity to learn about him. (2?Peter 3:9) Really, then, the way we worship God means either life or death for us.<br>  HOW TO IDENTIFY THE TRUE RELIGION<br>  5 How can ‘the road to life’ be found? Jesus said that the true religion would be evident in the lives of the people who practice it. “By their fruits you will recognize them,” he said. “Every good tree produces fine fruit.” (Matthew 7:16,?17) In other words, those who practice the true religion would be recognized by their beliefs and their conduct. Although they are not perfect and they make mistakes, true worshipers as a group seek to do God’s will. Let us consider six features that identify those who practice true religion.<br>  6 God’s servants base their teachings on the Bible. The Bible itself says: “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man [or woman] of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.” (2?Timothy 3:16,?17) To his fellow Christians, the apostle Paul wrote: “When you received God’s word, which you heard from us, you accepted it, not as the word of men, but, just as it truthfully is, as the word of God.” (1?Thessalonians 2:13) Hence, beliefs and practices of the true religion are not based on human views or tradition. They originate in God’s inspired Word, the Bible.<br>  7 Jesus Christ set the proper example by basing his teachings on God’s Word. In prayer to his heavenly Father, he said: “Your word is truth.” (John 17:17) Jesus believed the Word of God, and everything he taught harmonized with the Scriptures. Jesus often said: “It is written.” (Matthew 4:4, 7,?10) Then Jesus would quote a scripture. Similarly, God’s people today do not teach their own ideas. They believe that the Bible is God’s Word, and they base their teachings firmly on what it says.<br>  8 Those who practice the true religion worship only Jehovah and make his name known. Jesus declared: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.” (Matthew 4:10) Thus, God’s servants worship no one other than Jehovah. This worship includes letting people know what the name of the true God is and what he is like. Psalm 83:18 states: “You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” Jesus set the pattern in helping others to get to know God, as he said in prayer: “I have made your name mani

God wanted to "tabernacle" with His people, so He came to live with us for a short time, to experience fleshly life.  and He was born during the Feast of Tabernacles because of that.  He was conceived by the Holy Spirit during the Festival of Lights (Hanukkah) because He is the Light of the world.<br>  <br>  delme|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist?

My Bad>>  No not at all.  There are no verses which are meant to ignore.   On who's authority were you told this?  Which authoritative source did you get this information from.  Be very careful about in who you trust and take your information from.  Yahoo Answers R&S is merely a tool to get opinions, no professionals, no authoritative answers,  just a public site where people post questions and anyone can interject their opinion. <br>  _________________________<br>  <br>  <<So if God is not the author of confusion but peace, and Jesus came to bring division, not peace, isn't the bible very clear, that Jesus wasn't God?>><br>  <br>  OR, could they be, in actuality speaking of 2 different topics. <br>  <br>  1) Corinthians talking about what God "authors" -- what does an author do?  An author creates, from nothing, from its own mind.  Therefore God did not Create confusion,  but peace. <br>  <br>  2) In Mathew, is Jesus talking about what he is the author of? What he will create out of nothing?  OR, is he talking to his disciples and telling them what will RESULT from him.  <br>  Usually when someone talks about "brining" something, they aren't always the one who created it,...but are often times talking about a "result" -- the conclusion or result of their actions.<br>  <br>  IF they are the same,  then we should be able to insert "create out of nothing" into the verse and have it make total sense, because that's what an author does. - they create literature out of their minds. They create worlds and characters, events and stories out of their minds. <br>  <br>  So let's look at the verse in this light and see if it makes as much sense..<br>  <br>  Do not think that I came to author peace on the earth; I did not come to create peace, but a sword out of my mind. 35 For I author a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; 36and a man’s enemies will be the members of his household.<br>  <br>  You see, makes less sense,  so maybe they AREN'T talking about the same thing.  "author a sword" or "create a sword out of nothing"  ?  what?  "author man against his father"?  - makes no sense.  If they are about the same thing,  then why when you use similar words does it make no sense?? Maybe this hints at the fact that they are in fact 2 different topics. <br>  <br>  Let's look at 2 uses of "bring"<br>  A) I will bring the Potato Salad<br>  B) The Economic Stimulus package will bring much fighting in the halls of the Legislature<br>  <br>  In A) - bring is the primary action.  in B) the fighting is the result of the package. - wanted or not.<br>  <br>  __________________________<br>  <br>  So, I think verse #1,  is talking about specifically what God creates,  where as #2  talks about the logical result of Jesus's ministry and teachings. - God doesn't WANT bring fighting, but he acknowledges that this will be the result of his teachings. <br>  <br>  You see, part of reading within context is understanding the culture, the history of that era. <br>  You see the Jews had been continually attacked and subjugated throughout their history. By the Egyptians, by the Persians, then by the Romans. <br>  <br>  A HUGE part of Jewish culture was the belief that the Messiah, would deliver them from all that.  Would be a liberator.  Would ultimately bring PEACE by basically setting up his Kingdom on Earth.  Literally, taking up residence and either destroying or ending the rule of all the kings in the land. <br>  <br>  It was important that Jesus make sure his disciples understood that this isn't what the prophesies meant..that wasn't his mission. <br>  This was important because Jesus needed his disciples to spread his message after his death and resurrection. <br>  <br>  So he is literally telling them... LOOK, I'm not here to set up a kingdom on Earth and create a peaceful world,  like ya all think I am.  NO,  my teachings are going to tear everyone apart.  Jews against Christian,  Christian against Jew,  Roman against Christian,  Christian against Gentile. etc. etc.   Because ONCE my ideas are released on the world.. a **** storm is going to be released. -- mark my words.<br>  <br>  <br>  THAT is his basic message to him.  I don't get all this from JUST this one verse.. I get it from reading the entire bible,  TOGETHER, as it is intended to be.

WlK3KaVtaa	Prayer: A Daily Priority<br>  <br>  The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much. (James 5:16)<br>  <br>  1.  Effective prayer<br>  <br>  For prayer to be successful, it must be based on the Word of God and prayed in faith (Hebrews 11:6). God responds to faith, not emotions. Faith comes from hearing the Word of God (Romans 10:17), which plays a vital role in our prayer life. If we pray according to the Word, we can be sure that our prayers will be answered. Effective prayer is the kind of prayer that God answers and that brings results. Ineffective prayer is unanswered and is a waste of time.<br>  <br>  Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him. (1 John 5:14-15)<br>  Jesus told us that we are to pray to the Father in His name, and guaranteed us an answer: <br>  <br>  And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Most assuredly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you. Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.  (John 16:23-24)<br>  <br>  It is not only God's will to give us the desires of our heart but is also His good pleasure to do so! We pray to God, our heavenly Father, and we do this through calling on the name of the Lord.<br>  <br>  2.The force of righteousness<br>  <br>  Our foundation scripture says that the prayer of the righteous man avails much. Because we have been made the righteousness of God in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:21), we have the confidence that God hears us.<br>  <br>  For the eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their prayers; but the face of the LORD is against those who do evil. (1 Peter 3:12)<br>  <br>  We can approach our Father God with boldness because of what Jesus has achieved for us in dying as our substitute and paying the penalty for our sins. We come “boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need” (Hebrews 4:16).<br>  <br>  Our righteousness is not based on who we are or what we have done, but purely on the victory over sin and death won for us by Jesus. We can never be more righteous than we are right now. It is a finished work of Christ, and therefore, it is a solid foundation for prayer.<br>  <br>  3.Believing we receive<br>  <br>  God has set spiritual principles on the earth just as there are physical ones. His Word reveals those principles to us so that we can operate in them in order to establish His kingdom in our lives and on the earth.<br>  <br>  One of these spiritual principles is the force of faith. It is the prayer of faith that will produce results. Since it is impossible to please God without faith (Hebrews 11:6), everything we do must be based on faith (Romans 14:23), which comes from hearing the Word of God. <br>  <br>  For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, “Be removed and be cast into the sea,” and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says. Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them.  (Mark 11:23-24)<br>  <br>  At the moment of prayer, if you believe that God has heard and answered your request, you have the guarantee that you have already received what you have asked for. This kind of prayer is known as the prayer of faith.<br>  <br>  4.Other types of prayer<br>  <br>  The prayer of agreement<br>  <br>  The Word tells us that there is much spiritual power in agreement. Therefore, when believers agree on anything in prayer, God guarantees that what they pray for will be done. <br>  <br>  Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven. (Matthew 18:19)<br>  <br>  This is known as the prayer of agreement.<br>  <br>  Supplication<br>  <br>  The prayer of supplication involves entrusting our cares and worries to God so that He can be Lord in our lives (1 Peter 5:7).  <br>  <br>  Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. (Philippians 4:6)<br>  <br>  Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men. (1 Timothy 2:1)<br>  <br>  Praying  in tongues<br>  <br>  Prayer in tongues is essential for our own spiritual growth as well as for ministry and for praying the will of God into people's lives, organizations, cities, and nations (Romans 8:26; 1 Corinthians 14:4,14; Jude 20).<br>  <br>  Intercession<br>  <br>  Intercession is prayer on behalf of others. While we can pray with our understanding, we are limited because we do not know all the circumstances or the will of God for each person and situation. As mentioned above, it is important to intercede in tongues so that the Holy Spirit can pray God's perfect will through us. Examples of this kind of prayer can be found in Romans 8:26 and 1 Timothy 2:1-2.<br>  <br>  Spiritual warfare<br>  <br>  We must use the armor of God (Ephesians 6:13-17) so that we are equipped to enforce our victory against Satan and his demons. This shows us very clearly that prayer is very serious business, not something to grasp at in a crisis. We are dealing here with the power of God, the will of God, and the ways of God against the forces of darkness in the world.<br>  <br>  5.  Hindrances to prayer<br>  <br>  Unforgiveness<br>  <br>  An unforgiving heart will stop your prayers from being answered. Jesus told us that when we stand praying, we must forgive.<br>  <br>  And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses. For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your trespasses. (Mark 11:25-26)<br>  <br>  Broken relationships<br>  <br>  Wrong relationships in marriage, business, or our social life will severely hinder getting our prayers answered (1 Peter 3:7; Matthew 5:23-24).<br>  <br>  Wrong motives<br>  <br>  Wrong motives will hinder prayer. God looks on the heart and is strong on the behalf of those whose heart is pure before Him (James 4:3; Matthew 6:5-6; Luke 18:9-14).<br>  <br>  Doubt and unbelief<br>  <br>  Doubt and unbelief will stop prayer from being answered (James 1:6:-8; Mark 11:24). If we constantly speak words that deny our prayer or say the opposite of what we are asking God for, we are short-circuiting our own prayer! Our words must reflect our faith in God's faithfulness to His Word.<br>  <br>  No confidence<br>  <br>  Not realizing who we are in Christ can hinder our faith in God's willingness or ability to answer our prayers (2 Corinthians 5:21).<br>  <br>  6.  The deeper meaning of prayer<br>  <br>  Prayer is walking and talking with God. While He has provided various kinds of prayer to ensure that our every need is met, prayer is more than a list of requests or commands. It is in prayer that we start to develop our relationship with God. <br>  <br>  Prayer can become a lifestyle so that whether we are cleaning our home, washing the car, relaxing, or driving down the highway, we can communicate with our heavenly Father. In order to pray without ceasing as we are commanded to do (1Thessalonians 5:17), our hearts must continually be attuned to the Holy Spirit, being   sensitive to His voice and promptings.<br>  <br>  As we talk to Him, open our hearts to Him, and discuss our thoughts and feelings with Him, the Holy Spirit brings us closer to the Father. In turn, He will reveal Himself in a greater measure, and we will grow more sensitive to His voice.<br>  <br>  Praying in the spirit develops our own spirit and helps us to recognize and respond to Him more readily. We will start to receive greater revelation of the Word of God, and the anointing on our lives will increase.<br>  <br>  7.  Worship is prayer<br>  <br>  Not only is worship essential, but it is actually the highest form of prayer. Worship takes our focus off ourselves, our needs, situations and circumstances, and exalts and honors God alone. It is in worship that we come into the presence of God Almighty, and it is in that presence that we experience the peace, power, and provision of our Heavenly Father.<br>  <br>  Worship cannot be hurried because we must leave behind the cares and concerns of the day so that nothing fills our hearts and minds but the magnificence and wonder of our Creator, Sustainer, and Provider. It is when we abandon ourselves to Him in worship that the answers we are seeking are often manifested.<br>  <br>  So let’s come and set aside time to worship our Heavenly Father. Time spent in His presence will alleviate the pressures of this life and bring us into a greater awareness of His personal love for us and His desire to bless us and meet all of our needs.<br>  <br>  In prayer, we start to grow back into the intimacy and trust that God intended for us right from the beginning. It is in prayer that we begin to know Him and learn to love Him more. It is in prayer that we can praise and worship Him not only for what He has done for us, but simply for who He is.|`|uOwgkwTLaa	yes and yes.

No, that cannot be. And yet from the scriptures, it is also clear that God says He does answers prayer. So does God answer prayer and does prayer change things? Or more to the point, does God change His mind because of those prayers, or were the prayers that are answered always the will of God to begin with? We can only come to one Biblical conclusion if we deem God an all-knowing being. For you can't change your mind if you already know the final outcome. Obviously God uses prayer for the benefit of His people, as a help for them that they may be strengthened and grow in grace. It is truly a privilege for Christians to be able to approach God on a personal basis in supplication and prayer. It is this prayerful communion with God that I believe brings us closer to Him. God graciously uses believers as vessels participating in carrying out His will. And that means building us up that we may gain spiritual strength and fortitude through prayer. We are as clay in His hands used in the service of what He has preordained unto honor. We are not vessels that guide His hand, direct His steps, or that change His mind. We don't really move God by prayer, but by prayer God moves us. When we pray, it is God attending to us, through the communion of the Spirit of Christ. <br>  Psalms 141:2 <br>  <br>  "Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice." <br>  Prayers can only come up before God as the sweet smell of burning incense, if they are brought before Him in Christ Jesus. For it is Christ, the burnt offering, that makes our prayers as a sweet incense. It would be truly vain and egotistical for us to think that sinful man's selfish petitions would change the mind of God. The carnal imperfect will of man in prayer is obviously vastly inferior to the perfect plan of God for him. These two wills must be brought into harmony for any prayer to be answered. <br>  As a practical example, consider the Old Testament story of Hannah. She was a Godly woman who desired a son, and so prayed earnestly until ultimately God answered her prayers and gave her the son she desired. But we have to know that God's mind wasn't changed by Hannah's prayers. God (being omniscient) had always intended to raise up Samuel through Hannah, but it would be in His own good time, not Hannah's. And yet He gloriously allowed her the privilege to petition Him in this regard, that she (and we who come after) might grow in grace and in the trust of the Lord for all our needs. Those who claim that the Lord's mind was changed by her petitions are effectively declaring that they don't think that God was really sure of His will in this, or questioning His Omniscience. Because that implies that God really didn't have foreknowledge to know the end from the beginning. We must understand that the perfection of God's judgments, and man counsel changing God's judgments, are ideas that are antithetical to each other. And in this instance, let's not forget that it was the Lord who shut up Hannah's womb to begin with. and that no doubt so that she could participate in this communion with God, grow in patience, grace, resignation, and also to be set forth an example. For God is not our bondservant to do our will, but we His. <br>  <br>  1st Samuel 1:5-6 <br>  <br>  "But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb. <br>  And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb." <br>  1st Samuel 1:19-20 <br>  "And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her. <br>  Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD." <br>  God shut up Hannah's womb, and she prayed and petitioned the Lord for a son, and God indeed answered her prayer. But there is a big difference between God answering prayer, and God having a change of mind because of prayer. This is what seems to confuse some people. The point being, the Lord had always ordained and intended to raise up Hannah's son Samuel as a great prophet, but He answered her prayer that she might be an example of how God uses us, granting us participation in His glorious salvation program. As a result of this scripture notation, she is a roll model of sorts, a continuing witness to all of us who come after, of the power of prayer concerning God's people. <br>  1st Samuel 3:19-20 <br>  <br>  "And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. <br>  And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD|`|e50c8aae94677952ee9beadc76ab4c1baa	Yes of course, no doubt.

(Acts 3:14; 4:27, 30) The other “holy ones” having a share in the rulership are the 144,000 faithful spirit-anointed Christians, who are Kingdom heirs with Christ. (Romans 1:7; 8:17; 2?Thessalonians 1:5; 1?Peter 2:9) They are resurrected from death as immortal spirits to reign with Christ on heavenly Mount Zion. (Revelation 2:10; 14:1; 20:6) Hence, Christ Jesus and the resurrected anointed Christians will rule the world of mankind.<br>  39 Concerning the rulership of the Son of man and the other resurrected “holy ones,” God’s angel said: “The kingdom and the rulership and the grandeur of the kingdoms under all the heavens were given to the people who are the holy ones of the Supreme One. Their kingdom is an indefinitely lasting kingdom, and all the rulerships will serve and obey even them.” (Daniel 7:27) What blessings obedient mankind will experience under that Kingdom!<br>  40 Daniel was unaware of all the marvelous fulfillments of his God-given visions. He said: “Up to this point is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my own thoughts kept frightening me a great deal, so that my very complexion changed in me; but the matter itself I kept in my own heart.” (Daniel 7:28) We, though, live at the time when we can understand the fulfillment of what Daniel saw. Paying attention to this prophecy will strengthen our faith and bolster our conviction that Jehovah’s Messianic King will rule the world.|`|AA12084096	Peter wrote of a new heavens and a new earth.

He wants us to choose Him, and serve him and just be His children, because we want to be.  <br>  <br>  Think of God as your "daddy" not your "Father".

THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ENDORSING IT SINCE THE BEGINING OF OUR GREAT COUNTRY.<br>  First, the following excerpts from the Library of Congress web site:<a href="http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel04.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel...</a><br>  <br>  IV. Religion and the Congress of the Confederation, 1774-89 <br>  <br>  The Continental-Confederation Congress, a legislative body that governed the United States from 1774 to 1789, contained an extraordinary number of deeply religious men. The amount of energy that Congress invested in encouraging the practice of religion in the new nation exceeded that expended by any subsequent American national government. Although the Articles of Confederation did not officially authorize Congress to concern itself with religion, the citizenry did not object to such activities. This lack of objection suggests that both the legislators and the public considered it appropriate for the national government to promote a nondenominational, nonpolemical Christianity. (Bill comment: nonpolemical meaning non-controversial) <br>  <br>  Aitken's Bible Endorsed by Congress: <br>  <br>  The war with Britain cut off the supply of Bibles to the United States with the result that on Sept. 11, 1777, Congress instructed its Committee of Commerce to import 20,000 Bibles from "Scotland, Holland or elsewhere." On January 21, 1781, Philadelphia printer Robert Aitken (1734-1802) petitioned Congress to officially sanction a publication of the Old and New Testament which he was preparing at his own expense. Congress "highly approve the pious and laudable undertaking of Mr. Aitken, as subservient to the interest of religion . . . in this country, and . . . they recommend this edition of the bible to the inhabitants of the United States." This resolution was a result of Aitken's successful accomplishment of his project. <br>  <br>  Congressional resolution, September 12, 1782, endorsing Robert Aitken's Bible [page 468] -- [page 469] Philadelphia: David C. Claypoole, 1782 from the Journals of Congress Rare Book and Special Collections Division, Library of Congress (115) <br>  <br>  From the Leadership U web site:  <a href="http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/cdf/onug/contcong.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/cdf/onug/con...</a><br>  <br>  The Continental Congress: <br>  <br>  The Continental Congress of the original 13 colonies of what would become the United States of America was established to resist the unfair tax practices and tyrannical laws and policies imposed on the colonies by Great Britain. On September 6, 1774 -- less than two years before the colonies formally declared independence from Great Britain -- the Continental Congress made its first official act "a call for prayer." And on May 16, 1776, the Continental Congress appointed an official national day of fasting and prayer for the colonies: <br>  <br>  "The Congress....Desirous...to have people of all ranks and degrees duly impressed with a solemn sense of God's superintending providence, and of their duty, devoutly to rely...on His aid and direction...Do earnestly recommend Friday, the 17th day of May be observed by the colonies as a day of humiliation, fasting, and prayer; that we may, with united hearts, confess and bewailed our manifold sins and transgressions, and, by sincere repentance and amendment of life, appease God's righteous displeasure, and, through the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ, obtain this pardon and forgiveness." (Bill comment: the first officially sanctioned Thanksgiving in the new nation) <br>  <br>  The Continental Congress on September 11, 1777: <br>  <br>  "The use of the Bible is so universal and its importance so great that your committee refers the above to the consideration of Congress, and if Congress shall not think it expedient to order the importation of types and paper, the Committee recommends that Congress will order the Committee of Commerce to import 20,000 Bibles from Holland, Scotland, or elsewhere, into the different parts of the States of the Union." <br>  <br>  Whereupon it was resolved accordingly to direct said Committee of Commerce to import 20,000 copies of the Bible. <br>  <br>  <br>  Congress agrees to print Bibles: <br>  <br>  In 1777, with war plaguing the land, the Rev. Patrick Allison, chaplain of the Continental Congress, petitioned that body for a specific need – the printing of the Holy Bible. After America had declared its independence, the Revolutionary War had interrupted the supply of Bibles. Printed Bibles had previously come to America from England and Holland, but at this time of war we were often cut off from the rest of the world. As a result, Bibles were in short supply. <br>  <br>  The committee which received Rev. Allison's petition then submitted it to Congress on Sept. 11, 1777. The report stated: "The use of the Bible is so universal and in importance so great, that your Committee refer the above to the consideration of Congress, and if Congress shall not think it expedient to order the importation of types and paper, the committee recommends that Congress will order the Committee of Congress to import 20,000 Bibles from Holland, Scotland, or else where, into the different parts of the States of the Union." <br>  <br>  That mandate for 20,000 Bibles never went into effect, though, because publisher Robert Aitken printed the New Testament in Philadelphia. After successful print runs of this Bible, in 1781, Mr. Aitken petitioned Congress to aid in the printing of the entire King James Bible. <br>  <br>  The Congress responded with this resolution: "Resolved, That the United States in Congress assembled, highly approve the pious and laudable undertaking of Mr. Aitken as subservient to the interest of religion as well as the progress of the arts in this country, and being satisfied from the above report, of his care and accuracy, in the execution of the work, they recommend this edition of the Bible to the inhabitants of the United States, and hereby authorize him to publish this recommendation in the manner he shall think proper." <br>  <br>  Mr. Aitken then published the only Bible ever recommended by Congress and it is today a rare treasure.|`|AA10239241	You mean stripping Christmas as its Federal Holiday status?

The first amendment of the constitution says "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."<br>  <br>  This does not mean that religion should not have any say in government, it means that government should not support any particular religion and thus making it a state religion. Is it okay to have the Ten Commandments posted in a government building...why not, it is the basis for many of our modern laws.<br>  <br>  Thomas Jefferson said "We are teaching the world the great truth that Govts. do better without Kings & Nobles than with them. The merit will be doubled by the other lesson that Religion flourishes in greater purity, without than with the aid of Govt."<br>  <br>  He didn't say that the government would be better off without religion. I am Baptist, and being such, I believe in Separation of Church and State as being that government shall not restrict the practice of religion and shall not establish a national or state religion.<br>  <br>  If you actually think that taxing churches will solve the economic problems of this country, then you need to go to back to school and study economics.<br>  <br>  You are very naive my friend about the extremely imprtant role that religion plays in this country.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I did not say that Jefferson was a Christian, I said that he did not say that government should not be influenced by religion, he said government should not influence religion.<br>  <br>  Jefferson said "I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between Church & State."<br>  He did not say anything about religion having no involvment in government, only the other way around. I am not saying that as a Christian, I should force my beliefs on everyone else by making laws about it. I do not believe that. Involvement in politics by churches really should only go as far as to advocate laws that prohibit the restraining of any religion by the government. I am politically involved to preserve my rights, and because I believe a free-market capitalistic society to be best for its people. <br>  <br>  Do you honestly believe that taxing churches will raise the $8 trillion the gov't is telling us is now required for the economic bailout?<br>  <br>  $8 trillion = $8,000,000,000,000.00|`|dDprsKZYaa	Where do I sign?|`|P0uh2Ckiaa	Slightly backwards on at least one count: if churches paid taxes they'd essentially be buying into government services. Taxes go a LOT of places, and people who pay them are entitled to certain protections and services from the governments they support. If churches paid taxes, they'd essentially be able to argue for legal representation within the government - an open say in policy that affects them, a right to make and overturn the rules along with every other political interest group on the market.<br>  <br>  Separation of church and state is an ideal but it's fraught with loopholes that allow some degree of overlap between the two. Making churches pay taxes wouldn't further the separation, it would narrow the gap.

Therefore the world does not know us, because it did not know Him.<br>  <br>  a. Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God! Having just mentioned being born of Him, John speaks in amazement about this manner of love that makes us children of God. He wants us to behold it - that is, look at it and study it intently.<br>  <br>  i. It is of great benefit to the Christian to take a good, intense look at the love of God bestowed on us.<br>  <br>  ii. Bestowed on us speaks many things. First, it speaks of the measure of God’s love to us; it could more literally be translated lavished on us. Second, it speaks of the manner of God’s giving of love; bestowed has the idea of a one-sided giving, instead of a return for something earned.<br>  <br>  iii. What is it that makes us slow to believe the love of God? Sometimes it is pride, which demands to prove itself worthy of the love of God before it will receive it. Sometimes it is unbelief, which cannot trust the love of God when it sees the hurt and pain of life. And sometimes it just takes time for a person to come to a fuller understanding of the greatness of God’s love.<br>  <br>  iv. Behold means that God wants to see this and He is not ashamed to show it to us. "'There,' he says, 'you poor people that love me you sick people, you unknown, obscure people, without any talent, I have published it before heaven and earth, and made the angels know it, that you are my children, and I am not ashamed of you. I glory in the fact that I have taken you for my sons and daughters.'" (Spurgeon)<br>  <br>  b. That we should be called children of God: The greatness of this love is shown in that by it, we are called children of God. As God looked down on lost humanity, He might have merely had a charitable compassion, a pity on our plight, both in this life and in eternity. With a mere pity, He might have set forth a plan of salvation where man could be saved from hell. But God went far beyond that, to call us the children of God.<br>  <br>  i. Who calls us the children of God?<br>  <br>  The Father does ("I will be a Father to you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, says the LORD Almighty," 2 Corinthians 6:18)<br>  The Son does (He is not ashamed to call them brethren, Hebrews 2:11)<br>  The Spirit does (The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, Romans 8:16)<br>  ii. There is a sense in which this is a totally “unnecessary” blessing that God gives in the course of salvation, and a demonstration of His true and deep love for us. We can picture someone helping or saving someone, but not going so far as to make them a part of the family - but this is what God has done for us.<br>  <br>  iii. In this, we gain something in Jesus Christ greater than Adam ever possessed. We never once read of Adam being called one of the children of God in the sense John means here. He was never adopted as a son of God in the way believers are. We err when we think of redemption as merely a restoration of what was lost with Adam; we are granted more in Jesus than Adam ever had.<br>  <br>  iv. If we are truly children of God, then it should show in our likeness to our Father, and in our love for our “siblings.”<br>  <br>  v. It is important to understand what it means to be the children of God, and that everyone is not a child of God in the sense John meant it here. God’s love is expressed to all in the giving of Jesus for the sins of the world (John 3:16), but this does not make all of humanity the children of God in the sense John means it here. Here he speaks of those who have received the love of Jesus in a life of fellowship and trust with Him; But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name. (John 1:12)<br>  <br>  c. Therefore the world does not know us: Because of our unique parentage from God, we are strangers to this world (or should be).<br>  <br>  i. This shows the great danger of a Christianity that works so hard to show the world just how much like the world they can be; we can not be surprised or offended to find out that the world does not know us.<br>  <br>  d. Because it did not know Him: Ultimately, we should expect the world to treat us as it treated Him - rejecting Jesus and crucifying Jesus.

To which do you refer; "agapao??" or "agape??" or "phileo??" or "thelo?  ethelo??" or "philadelphia?" Do you even know which of these Greek words appears in the original from which you quote?<br>  <br>  It's "agape," which is divine, or unconditional love. Human love would be "eros" in the Greek, and "eros" never appears in the New Testament, so most if not all who answer your question, INCLUDING "CHRISTIANS," cannot even understand the question since the only form of love they know is "eros."|`|AQIhcBiuaa	To me personally, it means that we will also be ridiculed and misunderstood by those of the world for our belief in Christ just as he was when he was on this earth.

If a student takes it upon his/her self to engage in prayer during these times, or creates a "club" that is not funded by the school that centers around religious affiliation, than that is typically accepted. If a teacher were to ask a class to follow in prayer, than that is unacceptable unless they are teaching in a private school with a specific religious affiliation.<br>  <br>  This has mostly become an issue in the case of sports and the practice of coaches leading their teams in a prayer before a game/match/whatever. This was typical practice for awhile, but it is now greatly discouraged (or flat out against policy) as players on these teams tend to come from different religious backgrounds and it should not be imposed upon them to follow in a prayer that is not of their religious belief. Yes, they can always opt to not participate, but how does it look when a couple players sit out of any team activity? Not good, and the pressure is always on team mates to work together as one unit, in all activities.<br>  <br>  I don't believe that individual prayer could ever really be banned from school without stepping into dangerous territory... This country was more or less founded by those who were attempting to escape religious persecution, and to deny people the right to pray on their own would be crossing that line from protecting people's religious rights, to completely denying them. Allowing teachers/coaches/whoever to lead students in prayer is also risky as they are seen as role models and people in position of power, and imposing their religious affiliation on students could also be seen as a type of religious persecution to those who do not share their religious beliefs.<br>  <br>  I hope that was somewhat helpful! It's difficult to answer a question of that depth briefly.|`|PMdBZIHVaa	I don't think prayer as such has been banned, but enforcing a specific religions view should be.<br>  <br>  For example, as a Pagan, I would not want my children being forced to pray to the christian god, as we are not christian.<br>  <br>  I would assume people of other faiths feel the same.<br>  <br>  As an example, in a local school in my area, a teacher told an eleven year old student who was being raised pagan, that his parents where going to hell because they where not christian.<br>  <br>  This of course caused the child to be extremely distraught, and was completely inappropriate (not to mention plain old cruel) on the teachers part.<br>  <br>  Fortunately she was fired.|`|zWj6HXHNaa	It can be done but it shouldn't.<br>  <br>  I'm against school led prayer, however the school could appoint a certain time for students to partake in their religion.

When people say these things, they are referring to the fact that it is against the law for teachers at public schools to lead children in prayer. The reason for this is that US schools used to lead daily prayer, and it was always christian. This caused non-christians much discomfort as you can imagine. Some people believed it was their right to make the kids pray to the christian god even against their or their parents will, so laws were passed to stop this kind of forced indoctrination.<br>  <br>  Anyone of any religion is free to pray in school on their own, so long as they aren't bothering anybody.|`|AdqaXEWYaa	The supreme court looked into this issue and made the following statement, more or less that to ban prayer in school or any other public forum would be anti constitutional, however any prayer in school could not be led by a member of the faculty, staff, or any other paid or unpaid person working in the school. A parent who volunteers at the school could not lead a prayer service, but a student could. Some student groups meet in schools for religious observation, and some school are used as a public meeting place for different religious groups, which is ok, as long as they aren't sanctioned by the school or its members. This does not apply to schools that are private or chartered, or any school that publicly states its functioning as a religious entity, such as a parochial school.|`|Xu4x19y6aa	If a child, of any religious variation, wants to say a prayer in school, it should be allowed.

No, I look away.

If it is the US, then you praying by yourself, is not what they were referring to.  Public prayer in this case, means you being lead in a prayer, by someone else, usually a person of authority such as a teacher or principle, and that you have no choice to not pray.<br>  <br>  Other countries have different laws.  Turkey, an Islamic country does not allow public prayers in school.  France, a Catholic Christian country, does the same.<br>  <br>  While I grew up in the good old USofA, during at time when people first started protesting prayers in school as well as requiring children to recite the pledge of allegiance, I currently live in the UK, where prayers are part of the fabric of school life. They even have state sponsored prayers, in state sponsored religious courses, but they don't force everyone to join in.<br>  <br>  Having seen how un-religious people become when a state requires prayers and religious teachings in all schools, and believe me the British are not a very religious people as a whole, I have often thought, that the best way to destroy religion in the US, would be to allow the religious to force prayers in schools.

Everything is way too PC now a days if those who want to pray, pray so what, if those who dont want to pray dont, so what...<br>  People make to much of a fuss about people doing such a peaceful thing as praying.

And that doesn't mean every liar is instantly smitten. This was done as an example.  Just like the Christ rose Lazarus from the dead.  That doesn't mean every Christian that dies is risen from the dead, does it?  Of course not.  So Peter's actions were for those two specific, not the Body of Christ at large.<br>  <br>  Back to the Question:  No, the current church should not copy exactly the church in the book of Acts.  After Pentecost, the church was new and growing and under intense persecution.  It was communal for a purpose.  That purpose is past.

Yet, here we are today, just now sprouting churches that resemble the early church. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately in many of today's modern churches, they believe they have grown past, become much more mature then the early church. <br>  <br>  One of the most dangerous things I see is the churches who are claiming they are growing in the spirit, past having need of the Word of God. In other words, they are teaching things they feel have been given by God that supercede the bible by way of the Holy Spirit. <br>  <br>  Yet, that is not so. For if anything, and revelation from God will not do away with his Word, but bring more understanding of the Word of God. <br>  <br>  It is written we are not to add or take away from the Word of God. Today many churches do just that.|`|vciEtUcPaa	It should be identical in every way except that the methods due to the times have changed.The Word should still be preached without compromise and the power of the Holy Spirit would be in abundance.There should be as the church in the book of Acts be fellowship and ministry every day;from house to house.If persecution comes to the U.S.A. as it is in other countries,then the house church concept will flourish.Just as it has in China.If you want to look at a book of Acts church,then look at China.|`|6D2jlvgkaa	Of course no church on earth  ( including the one to which you belong to ) resembles the first Church recorded in the Book of Acts .Every one violates the Bible verses with selfish interests . 2 Timothy 2:9  says " I also want women to dress modestly ."

The early church were saints, they had no sin and were righteous people. This was because of putting their faith in this true gospel.<br>  <br>  The gospel today has been contaminated by the devil. Just like he did to Eve in the Garden, he through Constentine in the 4th century changed this true gospel dropping one part of the atonement, for he being a pagan could not read the Bible or even understand it.<br>  This deception has been with us ever since, hence the many different churches with different fundemental beliefs. <br>  Surely there is only One Father God, One Jesus Christ, One Holy Spirit and One baptism?<br>  But this is where the deception comes in and today most people believe in one part of the atonement rejecting the other part. This one part (the blood on the Cross) of the atonement for sins, cannot do anything for nobody, hence churches filled with sinners each one trying desperately to get rid of their sins with their constant repentance prayers.<br>  <br>  This true gospel is still shining brightly, and it lies hidden in the Bible. Jesus even said that if we seek we will find it.<br>  <br>  God in these last times has again appointed His servants to preach this authentic and original gospel in its purest form. You can reach it by going to this website. This true gospel is being preached through  Free Book distribution throughout the world.

We live in a more civilized society. We don't bury people as soon as they die like God wants the Christians to bury their dead!<br>  <br>  The Bible writers made it clear that CONTROL BY FEAR is deeply rooted in “God’s Plan of Salvation”… So if you think that you got saved GOOD FOR YOU!!! Make sure that you pay your FULL tithe and offering to the Church on time or God the Holy Ghost will zap you on the spot and the Church people will give you a quick Christian BURIAL without notifying anybody in your family. This is the Godly way of “doing” overdue Church account holders after Jesus Christ did away with the gross LAW of his Daddy God in the Old Testament days! Then they were dealing with only one God. In the New Testament we have 2 additional identifiable deities one is a make believe “sweet Jesus” and the other one is God the Holy Ghost! This last one is very touchy and unforgiving about money issues.<br>  <br>  Act 5:9-11 (NIV) Peter said to her, “How could you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord* (*alias “The Comforter”, alias “The Helper”, alias “The Paraklete” by not paying the FULL tithe and offering to the Church!)? Look! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door* (*in a truly Christian funeral nobody in the Church notifies anybody the death event to any spouse or relative! Have you noticed how cold bloody is Saint Peter about tithing?! God won’t allow him to do any counseling on money issues!) and they will carry you out also.” At that moment SHE FELL DOWN AT HIS FEET AND DIED* (*Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus! The Bible writers say that Saint Peter expected that the Ghost of God was going to slaughter her on the spot “at his feet”! Just like her husband was Divinely slaughtered a few moments earlier! The lady died without knowing that the Ghost of God killed her husband the same way! In his Popish authority Saint Peter made no intercession whatsoever for any of them! That ought to teach everybody a big lesson to get serious about giving to the Church and how truly Christian funerals are conducted!). Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband (Praise the LORD! That ought to teach moron Christians a big lesson on giving to the Church!). GREAT FEAR SEIZED THE WHOLE CHURCH AND ALL WHO HEARD ABOUT THESE EVENTS* (*Holy solution! There is nothing like a Holy Mafia option to keep Christians paying their dues to the Church on time and IN FULL!).<br>  <br>  It works all the time! Just have somebody slaughtered in the primitive Church and the rest will learn AND FEAR! It is the wanking Bible writer way to teach anybody a lesson! What if Ananias and Sapphira had children at home? Who cares? No Bible College student would dare to ask this question to their “God sent” teachers of the “Word”! Too bad the CNN or even FOX News was not there to report…! Not even the Mafia operates like that! You don’t need too many neurons in your brain to figure out that the Bible is a bloody religious fantasy book written to control religious people into submission to the Clergy! Some moron atheists don’t have the slightest idea how it is that Christians are so masochistically submissive! It is all a form of sexual gratification! Check with Kinsey!<br>  <br>  Any member of God the Holy Trinity puts to shame any mobster boss intimidating and killing anybody without mercy just to get your attention about paying your tithe and offerings IN FULL and on the spot to the Church… NO RAIN CHECKS! The Bible writers were very smart! They thought of everything! Although today the preachers use a more civilized "sow the seed and harvest bountifully" scheme to get your money. They do it with a CLEAR CONSCIENCE AND CLEAN HANDS and it is perfectly legal in most countries where politicians take FULL advantage of people’s religious gullibility like in the USA!|`|ajrnlFczaa	The way that our church today should resemble the first church:  We should be expectant of the Holy Spirit to come.  Today churches have their own program and there is no room for the Holy Spirit to move.<br>  <br>  How a Christian should handle additions and deletions of doctrines that are not in agreement with the first church:  First of all pray about it.  Is it something that God would not approve of, is it Biblical?  Then talk to your Pastor and/or Elders.  See where they are coming from.  If after that you know it's not Biblical, ask God if you should leave and join a different congregation.  Some are forming house churches because of the swaying from Biblical beliefs that seems to be penetrating the churches right now.<br>  <br>  It seems to be all about religion any more and religious ceremony.  What happened to waiting on the Lord and allowing Him to move in all His Glory?

2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	When I was in law school we talked a great deal about the nature of proof. "Proof beyond a reasonable doubt", Proof "by the preponderance of the evidence", proof as more likely than not. <br>  <br>  Personally I follow logic and reason. in the event that there is conflicting evidence on an issue, I apply Occams razor. (Google it).<br>  <br>  I strongly suspect most of the answers here are considerably less than honest. It is especially interesting to see people reciting the old line about how they don't believe in anything they can't see or feel. Do they believe in liberty? Do they believe in Democracy? Do they believe in Socailisim or the Free Market?  How do they justify their political views if they only believe in things they can touch and see?  I must have missed that day in school when the civics teacher brought in a bucket full of equality and a big lump of liberty passed them  around so we could all touch it. <br>  <br>  When you get past the BS, for  most people the REAL answer to this question,  depends on if they are EMOTIONALLY willing to be persuaded or not. If they aren't emotoionally ready, no amount of proof can open a persons mind.<br>  <br>  Abortion is an excellent example of this.  If someone has had an abortion, then no matter how much proof is supplied to them that abortion is murder, they will not be willing to accept said proof. Why? Because accepting the proof would mean admitting to themselves that they had paid someone to murder their own child, and for most people such an admission is to emotionally devastating for them to accept. Therefore they will NEVER admit that abortion is murder, no matter how much evidence is provided to them. They will cling to illogical and incorrect arguments like a drowning man clings to a life preserver, simply because they are not emotionally able to deal with the consequences.<br>  <br>  This is especially true in spiritual matters. People who don't want to change their lives won't be willing to accept a message that would require them to change their lives, no matter how much proof is attached to it. Unless and until someone "hits bottom" and are emotionally willing to make radical changes in their lives, most people simply won't listen.  (See Luke 16:27-31).<br>  <br>  7"He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father's house, 28for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.' <br>  <br>   29"Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.' <br>  <br>   30" 'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.' <br>  <br>   31"He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.'

Sn0CViR7aa	Jesus is referred to as the "Son of Man" 88 times in the New Testament. What does this mean? Does not the Bible say Jesus was the Son of God? How then could Jesus also be the Son of Man? <br>  <br>  The phrase "Son of Man" is a reference to the prophecy of Daniel 7:13-14, "I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought Him near before Him. And there was given Him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve Him: His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed." <br>  <br>  The description "Son of Man" was a Messianic title. Jesus is the one who was given dominion and glory and a kingdom. When Jesus used this phrase related to Himself, He was assigning the “Son of Man” prophecy to Himself. The Jews of that era would have been intimately familiar with the phrase and to whom it referred. He was proclaiming himself as the Messiah.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Bruce|`|ISPIa0n5aa	This sounds like some kind of contradiction at first glance, but in fact there is no contradiction. An examination of Scripture reveals that the phrase "Son of Man" carries broad significance.<br>  <br>  First of all, even if the phrase “Son of Man” is a reference to Jesus' humanity, it is not a denial of His deity. By becoming a man, Jesus did not cease being God. The incarnation of Christ did not involve the subtraction of deity, but the addition of humanity. Jesus clearly claimed to be God on many occasions (Matthew 16:16,17; John 8:58; 10:30). But in addition to being divine, He was also human (see Philippians 2:6-8). He had two natures (divine and human) conjoined in one person. <br>  <br>  Further, Scripture indicates that Jesus was not denying His deity by referring to Himself as the Son of Man. In fact, it is highly revealing that the term “Son of Man” is used in Scripture in contexts of Christ's deity. For example, the Bible says that only God can forgive sins (Isaiah 43:25; Mark 2:7). But as the “Son of Man,” Jesus had the power to forgive sins (Mark 2:10). Likewise, Christ will return to earth as the “Son of Man” in clouds of glory to reign on earth (Matthew 26:63-64). In this passage, Jesus is citing Daniel 7:13 where the Messiah is described as the "Ancient of Days," a phrase used to indicate His deity (cf. Daniel 7:9). <br>  <br>  Further, when Jesus was asked by the high priest whether He was the “Son of God” (Matthew 26:63), He responded affirmatively, declaring that He was the “Son of Man” who would come in power and great glory (verse 64). This indicated that Jesus Himself used the phrase “Son of Man” to indicate His deity as the Son of God. <br>  <br>  Finally, the phrase “Son of Man” also emphasizes who Jesus is in relation to His incarnation and His work of salvation. In the Old Testament (Leviticus 25:25-26, 48-49; Ruth 2:20), the next of kin (one related by blood) always functioned as the "kinsman-redeemer" of a family member who needed redemption from jail. Jesus became related to us “by blood” (that is, He became a man) so He could function as our Kinsman-Redeemer and rescue us from sin.|`|9f3fef8c85fa161e18f4848f36e97fb8aa	The meaning of the phrase "Son of Man" is that Jesus was truly a human being. Jesus also was fully God (John 1:1), but He was also a human being (John 1:14). 1 John 4:2 tells us, "This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God." Jesus was the Son of God  but he was also the Son of Man – He was in His essence a human being.|`|19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	In the Book of Daniel,(can't think of the chapter) Daniel has a vision where he sees "The Son of Man coming in the clouds of Heaven, approaching the Throne of the One Of Great Age."<br>  <br>  Christ Identified Himself as the Son Of Man, in the Book of Daniel.|`|vQ75GgNnaa	He is the second Adam.Where the first Adam failed He succeeded.<br>  He restored all Creation and Mankind in God's Grace.<br>  By being human He has given mankind the opportunity to know God through Him.<br>  Man was created in God's image and is therefore a reflection of God.<br>  He is saying that God wanted all of us to be like Adam before the original sin and He is showing us how to do it.

In calling himself this, He humbled himself for our sake.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I believe that Jesus wanted it to be clear to us all that He genuinely understands us.  Thus, He became human for our sakes - as we say in our creed each Sunday.   That He is not only divine but also human makes it easier for us to trust Him.  <br>  <br>  God The Father is so great,  so obviously and genuinely awesome,  that we might be afraid to approach Him at all, even in our prayers.    I believe that is why He really became human, while still retaining His full divinity.     This was to make Himself more tangible and approachable to us.  God has always loved us,  and as our Creator He has always perfectly understood us,  but a reasonable person might mistakenly doubt that.   Because He is so profoundly utterly superior to us,  we could doubt that He understands our petty little lives,  thinking He has no thoughts about such small things as our daily lives.<br>  <br>  Jesus proved He is God by performing miracles,  and He proved He knows what our lives are like by becoming one of us.  He didn't have to learn anything - God is and has always been omniscient,  but we needed proof that He knew us perfectly.   He gave us that proof by showing Himself to us bodily,  and while He performed miracles before our eyes He emphasized that He is "The Son of Man".  In that way we were able to learn that this being is awesome but not remote.   <br>  <br>  God is both mighty and humble.  That He is mighty was obvious to the faithful before He came to Earth.   That He is willing to be truly humble was obvious after He came to Earth.   For God to humble Himself so plainly is dazzling to me.    I accept by faith that The Eucharist really is the body and blood of our Lord.  This is one matter of faith in which I am able to be strengthened by reason.  <br>  <br>  The real presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist makes sense to me because it very much parallels the way Jesus humbled Himself to become incarnate in the first place.   Jesus humbled Himself almost 2000 years ago by becoming "The Son of Man",   and He humbles Himself at every Catholic mass when He comes to us in the form of a little wafer of plain bread and the form of simple wine.   <br>  <br>  Every celebration of The Eucharist reminds us of how far Jesus is willing to go to approach us.  He doesn't merely approach us either.  At The Eucharist,  Jesus enters us in a way that is more intimate, selfless,  and perfect than any merely human relation.   He taught us that He is the Son of Man to make us realize how real He is,  and how humbly loving He is.  Jesus reminds us of His awesome but humble love every time we receive the Eucharist.<br>  <br>  I hope and pray that many thousands - maybe even millions,  of people are moving closer to fully accepting this beauty during this season of Lent,  and that this Easter will be deeply and beautifully reassuring and uplifting for all people who receive the body of our Lord.    <br>  <br>  I am Roman Catholic.<br>  Peace be with you.|`|BY02DhfWaa	the title falls into two groups A. those in which it refers to CHRISTS humanity ,His earthly work, sufferings , and death .<br>  Matt .10: 23; 13:41: 16:27, 28:17:9, 24;27,|`|o4UrRbTvaa	Without a long copy/pasted answer....Because he was born of a woman.

rV1uAtt3aa	I'm curious - who's arguing against?<br>  <br>  Being an atheist, I've heard a lot of arguments - here are the top 5 I could think of:<br>  <br>  1) There is a God because life it too complex to have originated without a creator<br>  <br>  2) Without a God, where did the universe come from?<br>  <br>  3) The Bible tells us so<br>  <br>  4) 1/3 of the world's people can't all be wrong<br>  <br>  5) If you believe in God and he exists, you gain eternal life; if you believe in him and he doesn't, you lose nothing; if you don't believe in him and he exists, you miss out on the big reward (Pascal's Wager.)<br>  <br>  I find all of these arguments weak.  Perhaps someone else can come up with a better one, or better define one of these to make a decent case.|`|9m2LvlWdaa	god won't accept your proposal. He's already engaged to Fireball and Losasha.|`|AA10351261	Evolution has a far LESS chance of being the way the world came into being than creation. Google it and see. You can get some facts and figures from there. The fact that the world exists, life exists, and the complex the order of things point to creation being true. Creation aka Intelligent design- by God. The chance of shuffling up a deck of cards, throwing them up in the air, and the cards falling back down in suit and numeric order has a better chance of occurring than does evolution being correct.<br>  One of the oldest and the best selling book ever written says that God exists.  There must be a viable reason. <br>  You will have people say that they can't accept religion/God as being factual because they have never seen God and that there is no proof. First re-read the above. The world and life itself are proof. Second-If they say that they have never seen God/Jesus. These same people have never seen Christopher Columbus either. They have never seen an actual photo, heard an actual recording, seen an actual film, personally talked to or personally saw Columbus. They have only what history records. They accept Columbus that they have limited proof of but not Jesus. Why? The Bible contains a lot of history too and there is a lot more written about Jesus than there is about Columbus.  Jesus is the center of more books, radio, personal wittiness (preachers, evangelists, etc.) than almost anyone else. Third-A person(Jesus) did come in person. But they reject this. People saw and heard Him-but some reject this too. Jesus died for us, to forgive us our sins and make Heaven attainable. Jesus loves all of us so much that He gave His very life showing His love--but people reject even this greatest act of love. Why?  Christianity is the only religion that teachs that God (Jesus) dies to forgive people and attain Heaven and not the other way around. We don't attain our own salvation (we can't) God/Jesus does it for us. Why reject it?|`|XxWovDNCaa	Ask first for one credible shred of evidence that supports the existence of their god, that cannot be applied to any other god.<br>  <br>  That'll stop them cold.|`|IhzeHAx4aa	You already lost|`|Kg5KX432aa	sorry, but you're screwed. There's no sound argument for the proof of "god"|`|86PUxs1jaa	The question is a positive assertion that God does exist.  You are on the Pro side, which means you must provide evidence to substantiate this assertion.  The burden of proof is on you.  <br>  <br>  Be aware that, to win, the Con side needs only to refute your claims, which are impossible to substantiate with actual factual evidence. They do not need not prove that God cannot or does not exist.  If they're smart they won't even try.  Your best chance of winning depends mostly on the Cons screwing up and attempting to prove their own position, rather than systematically refuting your impossible assertions.  <br>  <br>  It's like a court trial.  The Prosecution (that's you) has to prove the assertion that God exists is true.  The defense (the Cons) need only attack your arguments and evidence well enough to demonstrate that you've failed to make your case.  If you can't effectively prove your assertion that God exists, they automatically win by the rules of logic.  <br>  <br>  You also need to understand that it is totally impossible to prove that God does not exist because there are an infinite number of possible ways that He might -- an infinity of unexamined possibilities will always remain to be refuted.  If the Cons do screw up and attempt to prove God doesn't exist, you can skillfully rebut them by simply offering any other possible way that He might exist.  If the Cons are smart and limit themselves to merely refuting your arguments -- you've pretty much lost.  ...unless you can somehow manage to lure them into attempting to show God does not or cannot exist, which is impossible to prove.    <br>  <br>  Be sure to remain polite and do not smirk, laugh, or make fun of your opponents.  I once lost an important debate for my team because I stupidly laughed at something ridiculous the other side said.  Since we atheists tend to be a bit arrogant, it's possible they may make the same error.  If they do, be sure to politely mention their rudeness and your supposedly hurt feelings in your closing arguments.<br>  <br>  In your opening arguments, do not make the mistake of asserting that you know God exists because you can hear his voice in your head or you feel his presence in your heart.  This leaves you wide open to the rebuttal that, since you cannot present your feelings for all to examine, they do not constitute valid evidence.  It is a common logical error for believers to presume their own perceptions and feelings are objectively real.  (See Solipsism.)  Remember, the Cons have only to discredit your arguments to win.  At the start, be very careful what your side claims is evidence or proof, so you don't make your team vulnerable to skillful rebuttal.  Save the appeals to emotion for your closing!  Be sure to mention the argument that one can subjectively feel God's presence because it does have great emotional appeal, but only use it in your closing arguments, when the Cons  will be unable to question the validity of such a logically weak position. <br>  <br>  Never attempt to use the Bible as direct proof of God's existence because the common Christian assumption that the Bible is God's inerrant word cannot be substantiated.  It is the epitome of circular logic to attempt to use God's supposed word to prove God's supposed existence.  First you'd have to prove God actually does exist, and then prove the Bible actually is His inerrant word, before anything in the Bible could be considered valid evidence of His existence.  Either save the Bible for your closing arguments, when the other side can't use it against you, or mention it sooner and deliberately gamble the Cons aren't clever enough to see the rather obvious circular logic.  <br>  <br>  Whether evolution is (or is not) a valid concept has absolutely nothing to do with whether God does (or does not) exist.  Don't even open that can of worms unless you are prepared to prove that the author of Genesis (Moses, 3500 years ago) knew more about living organisms than all of the modern world's biologists combined.  <br>  <br>  As for team strategy, because your team is Pro, it is best to use your most logical and careful speakers first, because they'll be less likely to set your team up for a skillful rebuttal.  Use those speakers best at appealing to emotion last, where their impact on the judges will be greatest and the Cons won't be able to use any logical errors they may commit against your team.  Always remember, the Cons will have the last oppurtunity to speak and, if they're smart, they'll use their most logical speaker last.    <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|3GO5k5nNaa	I would suggest that you might want to listen to the following lecture which explains about the Existance of God and answers the evolutionary agurments against it.<br>  <br>  It is delivered by a Muslim speaker, however, the relationale is very good.<br>  <br>  The sound track has a slight buzzing noise, but it is still very clear.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5653496523327915187&ei=1pmuSbYYltSoA97biKkP&q=shabbir+ally+world&hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a>|`|szsSPSmPaa	"There is a god" isn't a question.

All of them in wisdom you have made. The earth is full of your productions.”<br>  Rom. 1:20: “His invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made.”<br>  New Scientist magazine said: “The lay view persists—of scientists having ‘disproved’ religion. It is a view that commonly expects scientists to be nonbelievers; that Darwin put the last nails in God’s coffin; and that a succession of scientific and technological innovations since have ruled out the possibility of any resurrection. It is a view that is wildly wrong.”—May?26, 1977, p. 478.<br>  A member of the French Academy of Sciences stated: “Natural order was not invented by the human mind or set up by certain perceptive powers. .?.?. The existence of order presupposes the existence of organizing intelligence. Such intelligence can be none other than God’s.”—Dieu existe? Oui (Paris, 1979), Christian Chabanis, quoting Pierre-Paul Grassé, p. 94.<br>  Scientists have identified over 100 chemical elements. Their atomic structure displays an intricate mathematical interrelationship of the elements. The periodic table points to obvious design. Such amazing design could not possibly be accidental, a product of chance.<br>  Illustration: When we see a camera, a radio, or a computer, we readily acknowledge that it must have been produced by an intelligent designer. Would it be reasonable, then, to say that far more complex things—the eye, the ear, and the human brain—did not originate with an intelligent Designer?<br>  <br>  Does the existence of wickedness and of suffering prove that there is no God?<br>  <br>  Consider examples: Does the fact that knives have been used to murder prove that no one designed them? Is the use of jet aircraft to drop bombs in time of war evidence that they had no designer? Or is it rather the use to which these are being put that is causing grief to mankind?<br>  Is it not true that much disease is a result of man’s own poor living habits and his spoiling of the environment for himself and others? Are not the wars fought by humans a major cause of human suffering? Is it not also true that, while millions suffer from lack of food, there is more than enough in other lands, so that one of the underlying problems is human greed? All these things give evidence, not that there is no God, but that humans are sadly misusing their God-given abilities and the earth itself.<br>  <br>  Does God really care what happens to us humans?<br>  <br>  Yes, indeed! Consider the evidence: The Bible tells us that God gave man a perfect start. (Gen. 1:27,?31; Deut. 32:4) Man’s continued enjoyment of God’s favor, however, depended on obedience to his Maker. (Gen. 2:16,?17) If man was obedient, he would continue to enjoy perfect human life—no sickness, no suffering, no death. The Creator would provide man with needed guidance and would use His power to safeguard mankind against any calamity. But man rejected God’s guidance; he chose the course of self-rule. In trying to do something for which he was never designed, he has brought calamity upon himself. (Jer. 10:23; Eccl. 8:9; Rom. 5:12) Yet, over the centuries God has been patiently seeking out those who, because of love for him and his ways, are willing to serve him. He sets before them the opportunity to enjoy all the blessings of which they have been deprived because of man’s imperfections and misrule. (Rev. 21:3-5) The provision God made by means of his Son to redeem humans from sin and death is a marvelous evidence of God’s great love for mankind. (John 3:16) God has also set an appointed time when he will destroy those who ruin the earth and will cause lovers of righteousness to enjoy life in harmony with his own original purpose.—Rev. 11:18; Ps. 37:10,?11; see also the main headings “Suffering” and “Wickedness.”<br>  I<br>  s God a real person?<br>  <br>  Heb. 9:24: “Christ entered .?.?. into heaven itself, now to appear before the person of God for us.”<br>  John 4:24: “God is a Spirit.”<br>  John 7:28: “He that sent me is real,” said Jesus.<br>  1?Cor. 15:44: “If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual one.”<br>  <br>  Does God have feelings of the sort that we associate with living people?<br>  <br>  John 16:27: “The Father himself has affection for you, because you have had affection for me and have believed that I came out as the Father’s representative.”<br>  Isa. 63:9: “During all their distress it was distressing to him. .?.?.

Obviously, however, they never thought that some of their children may not share that passion. We are all different, and parents should not inflict their lifestyles on unwilling offspring.

It does tend to be the clingier type of people that belong to churches, because they need something to believe in, can't quite cope with themselves, therefore end up bothering the vicar when they don't really need to... I've seen it all in the past with methodist ministers.

You just have to get them to be intellectually honest, one way or another.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit - The following is an EXACT description of religious belief.  By your "definition", the old "cargo cults" from WW2 were not delusional.  The number of people that share a delusion does not change the truth, mate.  Seriously... how can you honestly think that that makes a difference?:<br>  <br>  <br>  Indicators of a delusion<br>  (Munro, 1999)<br>  <br>  The patient expresses an idea or belief with unusual persistence or force. <br>  That idea appears to exert an undue influence on his or her life, and the way of life is often altered to an inexplicable extent. <br>  Despite his/her profound conviction, there is often a quality of secretiveness or suspicion when the patient is questioned about it. <br>  The individual tends to be humorless and oversensitive, especially about the belief. <br>  There is a quality of centrality: no matter how unlikely it is that these strange things are happening to him, the patient accepts them relatively unquestioningly. <br>  An attempt to contradict the belief is likely to arouse an inappropriately strong emotional reaction, often with irritability and hostility. <br>  The belief is, at the least, unlikely. <br>  The patient is emotionally over-invested in the idea and it overwhelms other elements of his psyche. <br>  The delusion, if acted out, often leads to behaviors which are abnormal and/or out of character, although perhaps understandable in the light of the delusional beliefs. <br>  Individuals who know the patient will observe that his belief and behavior are uncharacteristic and alien.|`|AA11297267	I don't think that.<br>  How ignorant or delusional someone is comes through very clearly in the statements they make here or in person.  There's usually no need to lump everybody into one category beforehand -- as soon as they open their mouths (or type on their keyboard), their level of ignorance is perfectly clear.

I am a roman catholic and I am often tempted to believe that all other christian denominations are mindless fundamentalists. I am also temped to think that all atheists are nihilistic idiots.

Should you wish to contest any of my points or any parts of them, feel free to do so and I will elaborate on them:<br>  <br>  1. You can believe there's a god without being sucked into religious fundamentalism. However, by doing this you provide a moderate "cover" for the true fundies.<br>  <br>  2. Scientific facts themselves are not 'per se' incompatible with a belief in a god (or leprechauns for that matter). <br>  <br>  However, the scientific method and a scientific way of thinking (which is the only way of reaching scientific facts), is demonstrably incompatible with a belief in a god. I can formally demonstrate the flow of logic for you if you really want, but to make a long story short: beside a few logical tools, the scientific way of thinking relies on evidence to judge on the veracity of existence claims. As the case for the existence of a god is completely devoid of evidence, it's just not reasonable to think said being exists.<br>  <br>  Thus, you're not necessarily denying any specific scientific facts when you believe in a god, but you sure as day are denying science and reason as a whole.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit 1:"Invisible Talker: Refute this: The world is not 100% logical despite what humans try to make of it."<br>  <br>  What is there to refute? As is with the case for god, you give zero evidence in favour of your assertion. What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. Besides, my quarrel really isn't with random statements you pull out of your hat. I already answered the original question and my logic is sound. Admit it or point out a flaw in my reasoning.
2a93295e665a94d49d03426e34243078aa	????????A rude comment?  ...or, a doctrinal one?  Also, leave from where?  From a Sabbath School class?  ...or, from the Church?  Actually, no-one has a right in either case.  So, what I'm really asking is whether the comment and the response were in front of other witnesses.<br>  <br>  ????????If private, then I would just respond back, "I'm sorry, but you do not have the right to ask any peaceful member of God's church to leave."  If it escalates further, then my response would be the same as if the original comment and response were not made in private.  In such case, I would ask the elder if he would like to go with me to discuss this in a more Christian-like manner with the pastor present.<br>  <br>  ????????If the elder says, "No." at that point, then I'd relate to the elder that I'm going to go discuss it with the pastor anyway -- with or without the elder present.  If the elder then apologizes, then I would not go to the pastor unless the elder causes more "trouble" later.<br>  <br>  God bless.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  ????????It is a touchy situation.  Apparently, the elder was uplifting EGW over the Bible and your husband called him down for it.  If I've understood the situation correctly, then your husband should not have said something in such a "public" venue.  A more private conversation would have been much better (Mat. 18:15).  If, on the other hand, the elder was NOT uplifting EGW over the Bible and your husband was merely offering up a comment for consideration by the class, then it is best to have documentation of support for such a comment before offering it -- however, the elder would seem to be more in the wrong in this case.  Which of these two sceanarios is correct?  This also begs the question, though...  Did your husband actually leave the class?  Further, were you in the class, too?<br>  <br>  God bless.|`|1UokhVRXaa	James 3:16-17<br>  (16)  For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.<br>  (17)  But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Of course not!

2a93295e665a94d49d03426e34243078aa	????????The problem revealed by your question is one of definitions.  There is a difference between passing judgment upon someone and judging the difference between right and wrong.  Jesus said we are to judge the difference between right and wrong -- but not to pass judgment.<br>  <br>  Luke 7:43  Simon answered and said, "I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most." And he said unto him, "Thou hast rightly judged."<br>  Luke 12:57  "Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?"<br>  John 7:24  "Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment."<br>  <br>  ????????In fact, one of God's Statutes is that we are to judge righteously:<br>  <br>  Lev. 19:15  Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor.<br>  <br>  God bless.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	We are to judge righteousness rightly.... and we are fruit inspectors.<br>  <br>  If nothing but filth is coming from your mouth, and you love your porn, and you beat your wife....

Ultimately I can not judge your salvation.|`|XN0cYCATaa	Should We Never Judge?<br>  <br>  "Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment"; and "You have rightly judged."; and "Yes, and why, even of yourselves, do you not judge what is right?"; and "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel land and sea to win one proselyte, and when he is won, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves". (Jesus' Words in John 7:24; Luke 7:43, 12:57 and Matt. 23:15)<br>  <br>  There is an extremely serious error that is being believed by the vast majority of people caught up in christian religion. This error is literally making those folks unwilling and unable to discern truth. And what is this error? It is believing that all "judgment" is wrong. If this is true, then what is to be made of Jesus' Words above? In the verses above, Jesus clearly commands people to judge, commends people for judging, and judges himself.<br>  <br>  The key point to understand is that not all judgment is wrong, just various types of judgment. The types of judgment that are wrong according to Jesus are condemnation, as well as hypocritical and self-righteous judgment. On the other hand, right judgment is commended by Jesus as we see above. Right judgment includes the judging of truth versus falsehood. The sincere, serious and sober judgment of our own sins, as well as the gentle, and compassionate judgment and correction of other's beliefs or sins.|`|68149b1f13e1ba3a68e7e708172ff96baa	I think that sometimes people mistake "judging" peoples fruits as the same as actually judging the way God does.<br>  <br>  <br>  Too many christians ( and I have been guilty too) take on the role of God and try to Judge people as if they have that right.

Commandments of Men.. for the Word of God. Matthew 15:9 & Mark 7:7.<br>  <br>  FIRST... If God has called Something SIN... then it is wrong, no matter WHO does it.

And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?<br>  (1Cor 6:3)  Do you not know that we shall judge angels, not to mention the things of this life?<br>  (1Cor 6:4)  If, then, you truly have judgments of the things of this life, set those who are least esteemed in the church to judge.<br>  <br>  Jesus even said to JUDGE!<br>  <br>  (Luke 11:42)  But woe to you, Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, = = and pass over judgment = = and the love of God.

Romans 2:3.<br>  <br>  "But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at naught thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ" Romans 14:10.<br>  <br>  "Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way" Romans 14:13.<br>  <br>  "Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another? " James 4:11-12.<br>  <br>  Edit: "The Apostle" has missed it and is reading into God's word something that is not there as evidenced by his reference to "righteous judgement" as defined by Jesus himself in John 7. "Righteous judgment" is judging according to a single standard. Jesus, in John 7, is rebuking the Jews for using a double-standard.
AaVfzRamaa	I my Bible there is no reference to Generation in the book of Revelations? (KJT) Since GENERATION means the act of producing or begetting offspring. A generation  of people is composed of those who descend<br>  from the same parents. The statement, This is the book of the generations of Adam (GEN 5;1) means in effect, "This is the book of the descendants of Adam,"  In the sense of the reproduction itself, A generation is about 30 or 40 years. (Job 42;16; 1 Nephi 12:11-12. In the sense of measuring time by the lives of men, A a GENERATION since the Abrahamic day has been about a 100 years. (Gen. 15: 13-16; Ex. 12: 40, 4 Nephi 18. 22) From the standpoint of the measurement, A generation from the time of Adam to the flood  would have been nearly a 1000 years. Gen. 5. A generation may be measured in the terms of the life of the oldest persons who have lived in a particular period. (D. & C. 45: 30-31. 84: 4-5) It may also refer to a contemporary people living in a given age. (D & C. 5: 8-10|`|uOwgkwTLaa	Psalms 22 :30- A seed shall serve Him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a Generation<br>  <br>  I am not sure about a Revelations Scripture, but, the above can be translated as the seed(a person) shall serve the Lord for a Generation. Since we are to serve God all our lives as Christians and believers, then a Generation is a lifetime. In today's World, that could be 80-100 years but back at the time that it was written, 40 was the usual life span of an individual(not counting those Blessed and Chosen by God).<br>  Hope that helps some even if it isn't a direct answer to the Revelations question. Thanks and have a great day.

Perhaps a bit more context would help.<br>  <br>  Hint:  Click "edit" then "details" and tell us more about the question, if you can.  <br>  <br>  Okay, I'm going to guess that the question is about contrasting being saved, versus not being saved.  The question seems to presume that everyone who answers has already been saved, so perhaps you should describe how your own life has been changed by having been saved. (I'm an atheist and think such superstitious propaganda ruins people's lives and undermines our civilization, so I can't help you there.)  I suggest you think of ways that being saved has changed your life and write about that.  Notice how Sue L's answer is vague, describes nothing but her own emotions and is filled with essentially meaningless poetic figures of speech.  Try to sound like that.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Addendum:  Sue L, your personal emotional experiences have nothing whatever to do with anything that is actually objectively real.  You are a naive Solipsist and presume your subjective mental experiences are the basis of reality.  They aren't.  Objective reality does not depend on your thoughts, perceptions, or emotions.  I honestly thought you'd be pleased when I suggested JJ style his answer after yours.  My error, for not realizing you are just another tiresome Christian bigot.

Life is worth living because God put you on earth for a holy reason; that should be enough, but I can understand why some may believe they need "inspiration"  If you don't know why life is worth living without this " inspiration you're talking about, chances are no " inspiration" will fully make you believe that life is worth it.

So much of the scientific community is functioning on the notion that life comes from a chemical combination and yet no one can bring a dead body back to life. All the elements, chemicals, air, and physical matter that is present when a body is alive can be there when it's dead, but no scientist, doctor, or holy man can bring a dead body back to life. So called learned scientists claim that they will prove so much "in the future" but they cheat the innocent public in the mean time. We see life being created everyday from life. For example, when a living man and woman create a child; when a living tree drops a seed; when a living organism grows. No where in scientific history has life come from "dead" matter. If you find a scientist who is claiming to have created life you will see upon close inspection a manipulation of life's natural processes. <br>  <br>  In closing "Life comes from Life" <br>  <br>  Much of science requires a huge leap of faith. <br>  <br>  Please take my advise and study books written and translated by A.C.

Most historians believe it arose due to a combination of factors like the economic situation arising from the Treaty of Versailles, religious and economic tensions between the larger population and Jewish people, etc...

He may or may not have been born into a Catholic family, but he was no Catholic. Darwins theory of natural selection and survival of the fittest influenced an American woman named Margret Sanger. She came up with the eugenics idea. It was not well received in the States. Hitler embraced her ideas and put them into cruel practice in Europe. He also was trying to re-paganize Germany. He wanted to put the Teutonic pantheon of gods back into play in his reich.

What they didn't do during the war they are guilty of but they didn't start the fire.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Kiowaros, you are correct no atheist will claim that killing was done in the name of atheism because none has ever been.  Name one time where anyone has ever said, we does this in the name of no god.

Christians however, do.<br>  <br>  Edit2:  It's between you and god, nice quote mining.  The rest of the time Hitler speaks of his actions being directly from your god and the horrors of the Jews and Jesus.  Reality is he was in fact Christian.  Don't try to dodge it.

But that wasn't enough, Hitler and the rest of Germany wanted to expand and take *all* of Europe -- and when they started to do that, other nations stepped in to stop them.<br>  <br>  Hitler didn't have Darwin-inspired eugenics ideas -- he had racist ideas.  He considered Germanic peoples to have a god-given destiny to rule the planet, and was driven as much by his Catholic upbringing and German racism as anything else.  Hitler was a Christian, perhaps only outwardly but who can see what's in another person's head?  He did frequently justify his actions, and rally the German people around him, through references to god.<br>  <br>  By the way, I personally have never said that christian beliefs have been at the heart of every war -- that would be silly, since there has been war as long as there have been humans, and christians haven't been around that long.  *Religious* causes, however, have indeed been a contributor or the main cause in a very large percentage of the wars human beings have fought.<br>  <br>  Peace.

wM7pprr1aa	Many Christians are scared by the idea that morality is a simple social construct — as opposed to being some sort of divine commandment — because it leads to the additional concept of "moral relativism". They want to believe that some (or all) morals are absolutes. In other words, "God said don't do it, so just don't do it. EVER."<br>  <br>  The truth is, all morals are relative. This should neither scare nor surprise anybody. The world is constantly changing, society is constantly changing, life is constantly changing. Advances are made in the sciences, in technology, in medicine. New knowledge is gained which did not exist before, potentially changing moral judgments. Things which were once impossible become possible. Every situation you face in life is slightly different from any other that you've faced before. This is what makes life interesting!<br>  <br>  This scares some people, but it doesn't need to be frightening at all. Except for the few sociopaths among us, everyone on the planet is quite capable of making the simple logical judgments that are required to make the moral decisions that life demands of us. As demonstrated previously, "good" and "bad" are not difficult concepts to figure out.<br>  <br>  It is true that we may disagree in certain areas what constitutes good or bad. Abortion is a perfect example of such an issue. There is almost no agreement, even among atheists, on whether abortion is a moral or immoral act. Most people believe it depends on the circumstances, and what those circumstances are will differ from person to person.<br>  <br>  That's when, as a free and democratic society, we get together and enact laws. We sit down and argue about it, and eventually reach some sort of agreement on when exactly something is good or bad (or at least, when it is permissible and not permissible; leaving the moral value judgment out of it completely). This rarely makes everyone happy; some percentage of people will feel that their particular morals are not being upheld. But it is an unspoken understanding that we have about living together in a democratic society. It's the best we can do… since there is no god coming down from on high and dictating it to us.|`|yhTPcF81aa	What about selling your daughter into sex slavery?  Is that Just?

Not my understanding that morality is evolving along with human understanding.<br>  <br>  The point is simply that a never changing God, who is perfect and morally absolute, wouldn't order the death of children, or the punishment of stoning for a woman who is raped, that is clear in the light of our evolved moral understanding.  Basicaly we are pointing out that your notion of a morally absolute and perfect God is silly.|`|RNNsvSh9aa	No.<br>  <br>  The golden rule always applies.<br>  <br>  I dont want an angry mob to throw stones at me until im dead.<br>  Therefore stoning is wrong.<br>  period.<br>  <br>  Unless the first line was wrong for the ancient hebrews, stoning was also wrong back then.|`|ybFg4umCaa	God isn't affected by social norms though. He is supposed to be beyond that. He is supposed to be omniescent and would therefore be a moral absolutist and his moral judgements would be the same now as they were then.

If we *didn't* have this characteristic then the next time the grass rustled and we incuriously ignored it, then we would likely end up as a lion's breakfast, so having a certain amount of false positives is the price we pay for being able to protect ourselves from real threats.  Religious belief is largely an accidental by-product of that aspect of human nature, bestowed upon us by evolution.<br>  <br>  This can even be shown in the laboratory, by stimulating a certain area of the brain - the subject often reports a sense of a presence, an intelligent agent - so this may well be a part of the brain which has evolved to deal with this aspect of human nature.|`|QcviYozHaa	Peace..<br>  <br>  His signs are all around us, 1st is the earth, the sun, the moon, Us, the function of male and female of every species...<br>  <br>  He is The 1 God, the 1 and only, He does not Beget Nor is he Begotten, There is nothing like him.

For instance, dad believes in science and fact, mom believes in the christian god.  I think the christian god is a popular object of faith because it offers an appealingly rigid structure to those who need a higher power.  It also offers a large group of people with common interests, readily available literature and meeting places.|`|b1PvVoB0aa	For someone who claims that theism is illogical you use some pretty bad arguments.<br>  <br>  Burden of Proof. You assert that there are no logical or scientific arguments for God (not god), so you need provide support. A negative assertion still needs to be proven. If I assert that there is plenty of logic and science that proves God's existence, then I need to provide support.<br>  <br>  Appeal to Ridicule. You claim that our arguments are laughable. That is not logical.<br>  <br>  God is eternal. The Bible is very clear about this. If He is eternal, then he doesn't have a beginning or an end. He doesn't come from anywhere. If God "came from" somewhere, then that place would have existed before God did, and you have a real chicken/egg problem.<br>  <br>  Many people choose a religion based partly or entirely because of emotions. Atheists are no different. They usually choose their philosophy for some emotional reason. <br>  <br>  You have never heard of the Ten Commandments if you think religion causes us to do things like lie and kill.

The figure 365 does not only represent the number of days in the calendar, but it is also the figure that shows the astronomic relationship between our world and the sun. When our world completes its round around the sun, it has revolved 365 times around its own axis. In other words, when the world has completed its cycle around the sun, this means we have lived 365 days on earth. It is important that the word “one day” has been used 365 times in the Quran, because the world’s revolution around the sun takes 365 days. The exact number 365 is not accidental! This word alone is enough to show that there is a conscious order in the Quran.

The fact of Jesus' birth, the place, the nature, and the purpose are clearly taught in the scriptures (Matt. 1; 2). However, God did not see fit to explicitly reveal the date. We do know that Jesus was born during the reign of Herod the King (Matt. 2: 1). History informs us that this Herod died in 4 B. C. Hence, Jesus would have been born no later than 4 B. C. We also learn from the Bible that a census was being taken at the time of Jesus' birth, in fact, Joseph and Mary were at Bethlehem to enroll when Jesus was born (Lk. 2: 1-7). Quirinius, the Governor of Syria, conducted this census. Based on the believed date of this census, some place Jesus' birth at 6 B. C. Some scholars believe Jesus was born in 5 B. C. In the center column reference of some versions of the King James Translation, we read regarding the time of Matthew 2, "The fourth year before the common account called Anno Domini (A. D., dm)." This date, I believe, is the product of the work of Dionysius Exiguus, a sixth century monk. <br>  <br>      The real matter of importance. The matter of great consequence is that Jesus was born of a virgin, just as prophesied 700 years earlier (Matt. 1: 23; Isa. 9: 6). Jesus lived a sinless life and died a sacrificial death (Heb. 4: 15; Matt. 26: 28). Jesus claimed to be the Son of God and proved that claim by many undeniable miracles (Jn. 20: 30, 31). <br>  <br>      Christians celebrate the glorious death and resurrection of Jesus each Lord's Day when they observe the Lord's Supper (Matt. 26: 26-29, Acts 20: 7). Jesus is the truth, the way, and the life (Jn. 14: 6). This same Jesus who experienced such a humble birth is coming back as the exalted judge of all men (Matt. 25: 31-46).|`|AQIhcBiuaa	As a Christian, the exact date of his birth does not matter to me.

I love it when theists try to stump atheists with "gotcha" questions such as "who started the big bang".  They invariably say something along the lines that "if there was a big bang then it must have been started by God because something can't come from nothing, except for God.  He can come from nothing."  or some such nonsense.  Don't even bother to ask them why, if God can always have existed, can't we simplify things and say that time always existed.  The "God is different" response is never followed by an explanation, even a theoretical theological one.<br>  <br>  It could be that the reason questions like this get so many insulting responses is because the questions aren't particularly well thought out.  Don't blame the atheists when the theists ask a poor question.|`|QVO9b0a8aa	Nobody created the universe, the universe's creation was spontaneous.<br>  <br>  Nothing controlled the big bang, just like nothing controls gravity. <br>  <br>  And, who knows what it was like before the big bang?

Okay...the Universe was NOT created.  It expanded from a singularity.  What happened before that is something we do not know as of yet.  In science, it is perfectly okay and even encouraged to say "we don't know yet."  The laws of physics determine the paths of the comets and it is simply not true that they come close to hitting the Earth daily.  We actually were hit by a comet in the Tunguska event.  Here's the info on that:  The Tunguska Event, or Tunguska explosion, was a powerful explosion that occurred near the Podkamennaya (Lower Stony) Tunguska River in what is now Krasnoyarsk Krai of Russia, at around 7:14 a.m. (0:14 UT, 7:02 a.m. local solar time) on June 30, 1908 (June 17 in the Julian calendar, in use locally at the time).<br>  <br>  Although the cause is the subject of some debate, the explosion was most likely to have been caused by the air burst of a large meteoroid or comet fragment at an altitude of 5–10 kilometres (3–6 miles) above Earth's surface. Different studies have yielded varying estimates for the object's size, with general agreement that it was a few tens of metres across.<br>  <br>  Although the meteor or comet burst in the air rather than directly hitting the surface, this event is still referred to as an impact. Estimates of the energy of the blast range from 5 megatons to as high as 30 megatons[5] of TNT, with 10–15 megatons the most likely—roughly equal to the United States' Castle Bravo thermonuclear explosion set off in late February 1954, about 1,000 times as powerful as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan and about one third the power of the Tsar Bomba, the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated. The explosion knocked over an estimated 80 million trees over 2,150 square kilometres (830 square miles). It is estimated that the earthquake from the blast would have measured 5.0 on the Richter scale, which was not yet developed at the time. An explosion of this magnitude is capable of destroying a large metropolitan area. This possibility has helped to spark discussion of asteroid deflection strategies.<br>  <br>  Although the Tunguska event is believed to be the largest impact event on land in Earth's recent history, impacts of similar size in remote ocean areas would have gone unnoticed before the advent of global satellite monitoring in the 1960s and 1970s.<br>  <br>  There...you have an answer....now stop whining!<br>  <br>  Edit:  I knew this would be a waste of time!

5yFnjp56aa	Calling Sikhs as Hindus is selfish, however calling them brothers is never wrong. All humans are one race and are brothers and sisters. It is also the aim of Sikhism to preach brotherhood.  More they say Sikhs are Hindus more we get chances to share Sikh ideology with world. No need to get upset. These hymns from Guru Granth Sahib(Sikh Scriptures) will show the difference:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=KeertanPage&K=1136&L=11&id=48599" rel="nofollow">http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=KeertanPage&K=1349&L=11&id=57691" rel="nofollow">http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=KeertanPage&K=556&L=9&id=24590" rel="nofollow">http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani...</a><br>  <br>  Sikhism was started by Guru Nanak(1469-1539). Japji and Asa dee War are his famous writings. <br>  It is a religion of modern age means it does not conflict with science. It does not believe in any kind of superstition. It talks about universal brotherhood. It does not have any upper or lower caste. There is no satan, hell or heaven. There is no fasting or any importance of rituals. It talks about service of mankind and sharing your wealth(worldly as well as spiritual). Man and woman are equal and God does not have a gender. It talks about fighting against injustice. It brings peace to heart. It talks about music and its good use. It is only religion among major religions(fifth in number, jews are sixth) where you get first hand information written by Sikh Gurus and Bhagats rather than written by someone else after several years of death of their prophets. It does not give any special importance to priests. Sikh place of worship is called Guruduara where anyone of any belief or gender can go and free food called langar is served. Hindus have killed thousands of sikhs, burnt their religious places, holy books, raped ladies, abuse children etc etc the list goes on.|`|7RQ6XQnPaa	SIKHS ARE REAL HINDUS AND THEIR HISTORY IS OF HINDUS|`|0Mi6AQwxaa	SHOUT SHOUT let it all out ........what happened to you, someone molested you ? <br>  <br>  Anyway - im just cutting and pasting here, so that you can shout out even more<br>  <br>  SIKHISM <br>  <br>  To understand Sikhism you have to understand Hinduism. Hinduism is not Christianity and Islam which are codified religions, and have a book and a prophet. Hinduism has originated from various rituals tribal customs and social life over the centuries. Hinduism has 1000’s of Gods and Goddesses and various diverse thoughts. <br>  <br>  Predominant amongst these thoughts is a way of life called Sanatan Dharma which more than 60% of the Hindus follow, and this is generally mistaken as Hinduism, and the other thoughts are treated as offshoots of Hinduism. The real truth is that Hinduism means Sanatan Dharma AND all the other thoughts. Sikhism is but one of these thoughts. <br>  <br>  Firstly, the British with their policy of divide and rule, and secondly, political turmoil and hatred between Hindus and Sikhs has put the idea of a separate identity in the mind of us Sikhs. Many of my co-religionists will say – but we have different ideas as compared to Hinduism. Sure - I agree that we are different in ways but there are 50 – 100 major different thoughts within Hinduism and we are BUT one of them. <br>  <br>  Do you understand ? Whereas fundamentalist Sikhs we say that we are 1 amongst 7 great world religions the fact is that there are actually 4 great religions. One - Christianity has various branches - Catholic, Protestant, Methodist, Adventist, etc. Second – Islam has various branches - Shia, Sunni, Ahmediya etc. There is Judaism and finally Hinduism ( which is a collection of various beautiful thoughts like Buddhism, Sanatana Dharma, Sikhism, Jainism, Arya Samajists, Vaishnav, Shaivaites Manbhum, Santhal etc ) <br>  <br>  So Sikhism is born out of Hinduism. Guru Nanak was born a Hindu, he was a traveling holy man who followed a custom of Sant Mat ( or Saint Tradition ) quite popular amongst saints those days. It was a thought he inculcated in his believers and told them to learn it. His believers were called Sikhs as Sikh means – ‘to learn’ We had 9 more Gurus. Yes Guru Nanak also took some minor feedback from Islam but that is the nature of Hinduism – to absorb from everyone.

B5cuNTxQaa	It is an attempt to mix science with magic.<br>  .|`|0lnamekJaa	I believe you are refering to the practice of Eugenics:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics</a><br>  <br>  Eugenics is a scientific field involving the controlled breeding of humans in order to achieve desirable traits in future generations.[2] Eugenics was at its height in first half of the 20th century and was largely abandoned with the end of World War II.[3] At its zenith, the movement often pursued pseudoscientific notions of racial supremacy and purity.[4]<br>  <br>  Eugenic was not confined to any one country or culture, but was practised around the world and was promoted by governments, and influential individuals and institutions. Its advocates regarded it as a social philosophy for the improvement of human hereditary traits through the promotion of higher reproduction of certain people and traits, and the reduction of reproduction of certain people and traits.[5] Today it is widely regarded as a brutal movement which inflicted massive human rights violations on millions of people.[6] The "interventions" advocated and practised by eugenicists involved prominently the identification and classification of individuals and their families, including the poor, mentally ill, blind, 'promiscuous women', homosexuals and entire "racial" groups——such as the Roma and Jews——as "degenerate" or "unfit"; the segregation or institutionalisation of such individuals and groups, their sterilization, their "euthanasia", and in the worst case of Nazi Germany, their mass extermination.[7] The practices engaged in by eugenicists involving violations of privacy, attacks on reputation, violations of the right to life, to found a family, to discrimination are all today classified as violations of human rights. The practice of negative racial aspects of eugenics, after World War II, fell within the definition of the new international crime of genocide, set out in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.[8]<br>  <br>  The modern field and term were first formulated by Sir Francis Galton in 1883,[9] drawing on the recent work of his cousin Charles Darwin. From its inception eugenics was supported by prominent people, including H. G. Wells, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, Emile Zola, George Bernard Shaw, John Maynard Keynes, William Keith Kellogg, Margaret Sanger, Winston Churchill, and Sidney Webb.[10][11][12] Its most infamous proponent and practitioner was however Adolf Hitler who praised and incorporated Eugenic ideas in Mein Kampf, and emulated Eugenic legislation for the sterilization of "defectives" that had been pioneered in the United States.[13] G. K. Chesterton was an early critic of the philosophy of eugenics, expressing this opinion in his book, Eugenics and Other Evils. Eugenics became an academic discipline at many colleges and universities, and received funding from many sources.[14] Three International Eugenics Conferences presented a global venue for eugenicists with meetings in 1912 in London, and in 1921 and 1932 in New York. Eugenic policies were first implemented in the early 1900s in the United States.[15] Later, in the 1920s and 30s, the eugenic policy of sterilizing certain mental patients was implemented in a variety of other countries, including Belgium,[16] Brazil,[17] Canada,[18] and Sweden,[19] among others. The scientific reputation of eugenics started to decline in the 1930s, a time when Ernst Rüdin used eugenics as a justification for the racial policies of Nazi Germany, and when proponents of eugenics among scientists and thinkers prompted a backlash in the public. Nevertheless, the second largest known eugenics program, created by social democrats in Sweden, continued until 1975.[19]<br>  <br>  Since the postwar period, both the public and the scientific communities have associated eugenics with Nazi abuses, such as enforced racial hygiene, human experimentation, and the extermination of undesired population groups. However, developments in genetic, genomic, and reproductive technologies at the end of the 20th century have raised many new questions and concerns about what exactly constitutes the meaning of eugenics and what its ethical and moral status is in the modern era.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Evolution involves three main processes.<br>  1.

In other words, he can't say...

dc0a07ce34883d4af43a326a660d000aaa	This was a 'piling-on,' without a doubt.<br>  <br>  Jesus attacked the tree because it did not have any fruit on it.  The problem is that it was winter, and the tree was not suppose to have fruit on it in that season.  Jesus either did not know anything about fruit trees and seasons, or He did not care.  He decided to show what a jerk He can really be by behaving like a violent, spoiled child - just like He did when He used a weapon to attack the businessmen at the temple.<br>  <br>  That Jesus was just not a very nice guy, according to the Bible.
h11oTtQraa	All of the Old Testament, is an example of Jewish tradition and culture. Plus, when Greeks and Romans started to settle in their areas around the Holy Roman Empire, they were tolerable towards Jewish customs. <br>  <br>  Now when Jesus came a long, Jewish people (Hebrews) thought of him as a false prophet. Which I can understand..Just imagine believing in God and suddenely some guy is walking around spreading rumors that he's the son of God and does all these miracles. They saw him as a false prophet and knew he was threat by jeopardizing believers and non-believers. Therefore, they felt the need to get rid of him before he does anything bad. <br>  <br>  Jewish tradition believes that the Messiah has still not come to Earth yet.

Solomon's Temple was rebuilt and renamed Herod's Temple.<br>  2.  The High Priest was chosen by Rome.<br>  3.  The official language of Israel was Latin...not Hebrew.<br>  4.  The official currency was Roman and not the shekel.<br>  <br>  So while it is true that Rome tolerated the Jewish religion, it is also true that Roman influence was felt at all levels.  <br>  <br>  Understand, that as there isn't a clear definition that defines Judaism, the are multiple answers to this question that are all equally right...according to that sect's POV.<br>  <br>  The biggest impact on the Jewish religion was that the era of the prophet ended about 500 years before.  As Michelle R said:  ***from a big-picture perspective, where G-d's will for these current times is truly unknowable, there is nothing wrong with that.  The problem with applying one religion's yardstick to another religion's belief system, is that it will never measure up. Orthodox Jews may believe that Reform Jews are not practicing true Judaism because they don't see the laws as binding***<br>  <br>  Since Jews believe, ***G-d's will for these current times is truly unknowable***, then <br>  <br>  1.  believing the Torah is or is not binding<br>  2.  naming the Temple after Herod<br>  3.  having a high priest selected by Rome<br>  4.  having to exchange the money of the people for Shekels in the Temple<br>  <br>  are just symptoms of the issue of not knowing God's will as Michelle R says.  <br>  <br>  To answer your question specifically:<br>  <br>  Mark 6:***34When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things. <br>  <br>   35By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. "This is a remote place," they said, "and it's already very late. 36Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat." <br>  <br>   37But he answered, "You give them something to eat." <br>        They said to him, "That would take eight months of a man's wages[e]! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?" <br>  <br>   38"How many loaves do you have?" he asked. "Go and see." <br>        When they found out, they said, "Five—and two fish." <br>  <br>   39Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass. 40So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. 41Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all. 42They all ate and were satisfied, 43and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish. 44The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand***<br>  <br>  Yes, He did.|`|znt2s3sMaa	They read from the Torah, observed the Sabbath and other commandments and ordinances, and believed that by doing this, they would go to Heaven.

Many (perhaps most) of the Catholics in my city do keep lent, but don't know any Christians outside of the Catholic Church that keeps lent.|`|WjRqYf6naa	Those who keep Lent do so as a remembrance of Jesus's sacrifice for us. I do not belong to a group which observes it, but I do admire the discipline involved.|`|nHizaTiDaa	It makes them feel like they are "doing" something holy.<br>  <br>  And that is not all Christians who "do lent"- that is a Catholic thing, and probably Orthodox, too?<br>  <br>  It is the Weeping for TAmmuz ancient pagan thing, that those churches incorporated into her rituals.

However I do fast and self-sacrifice often, when I do, its between me and God. I use the time I would use doing those things to pray, to read my bible, and to meditate on the word.|`|znt2s3sMaa	Because they believe in Jesus, and it is a remembrance of the temptation He endured in the wilderness when He was being tempted by Satan.|`|vNvtwuBfaa	Christians don't bother with lent.  Lent is a Catholic tradition.|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	I wish I knew, bud. I wish I knew.|`|xelkbdbdaa	Catholics keep lent. This is not a practice of most other Christian denominations. I guess they believe that not eating meat on Fridays (a rule that has changed over centuries) will keep them from meeting the evil one.|`|lqt3wTQvaa	because it's a time when we sacrifice something, like Jesus did...|`|4bqm1zTCaa	It's a man made thing so i wonder.
l8N2uC6Iaa	Welcome Home!!!!  May your journey be blessed and fruitful.  <br>  <br>  No you can't go to confession yet but you can always contact your pastor and chat with him.  You can do everything everybody else does during the mass except communion.  Feel free to sit/kneel/stand as they say.  <br>  <br>  My prayers will be with you.|`|FmazIF6Maa	Congrats on finding your path. Catholicism is a beautiful religion. I am no longer Catholic, but I was raised Catholic and still have respect for the Church and it's teachings. <br>  <br>  Ignore the answers coming (I'm sure they are) about how you are a sheep to join a religion. These people say everyone should raise kids to make their own choices like your mom did, but if you choose a religion, they'll ridicule your choice.<br>  <br>  Also ignore those that will spout that the Catholic Church is evil or misled. They are ignorant and generally don't understand it. Don't let them put a damper on your enthusiasm. <br>  <br>  <br>  I was Catholic to around/about the time I was 20. I remember through my adolescence wanting to get closer to God and finding Catholic Prayer Books, that would list prayers for different occasions. <br>  <br>  Also, if you haven't already, learn the rosary.  In Catholic school, we used to do one section of the rosary every morning. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	The best resource for knowing what to do is to get a copy of the book, "The How To Book of the Mass" by Michael Dubriel. It's short, easy to read, and VERY helpful. You can pray, sing, and more at Mass, and that book will show you how.<br>  <br>  As you have not been baptized, you have no need to go to Confession. Baptism will wash away all your sins, little and big, when the time comes. <br>  <br>  You can also practice Catholicism every day. Call the parish priest and explain that you need a spiritual guide. Perhaps there is a religious sister who can coach you along for a week or two, to help you adopt a Catholic lifestyle. Prayers like the Daily Office, the Rosary, and the Chaplet of Divine Mercy are available to EVERY person, whether they have been baptized or not.|`|FGcwxZz0aa	I am a convert to Catholicism after 50 years as a Protestant and 25 years as a minister.

Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.<br>  <br>  Our Lady has 117 titles. She selected this title at Fatima: "I am the Lady of the Rosary."<br>  <br>  St. Francis de Sales said the greatest method of praying IS- Pray the Rosary.<br>  <br>  St. Thomas Aquinas preached 40 straight days in Rome, Italy on just the Hail Mary.<br>  <br>  St. John Vianney, patron of priests, was seldom seen without a rosary in his hand.<br>  <br>  "The rosary is the scourge of the devil" -- Pope Adrian VI<br>  <br>  "The rosary is a treasure of graces" -- Pope Paul V<br>  <br>  Padre Pio, the stigmatic priest, said: "The Rosary is THE WEAPON"<br>  <br>  Pope Leo XIII wrote 9 encyclicals on the rosary.<br>  <br>  Pope John XXIII spoke 38 times about Our Lady and the Rosary. He prayed 15 decades daily.<br>  <br>  St. Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort wrote: "The rosary is the most powerful weapon to touch the Heart of Jesus, Our Redeemer, who so loves His Mother."<br>  <br>  Pope Pius XII: “There is no surer means of calling down God’s blessings upon the family…than the daily recitation of the Rosary.”<br>  <br>  Pope Pius XII: “The Rosary is the compendium of the entire Gospel.”<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent book on the rosary, written by St. Louis de Montfort.

Your story is very much like mine. I too was denied the sacraments (due to my parents divorce, dad's an atheist -- he meant well and it turned out for the best. I know a lot about my faith and didn't come into the sacraments blindly.) until I was an adult. All good things for those who wait!<br>  <br>  Anyway, read Catholicism for Dummies for a good all around informative tour of the Faith. As far as the Eucharist: read Scott Hahn's The Lamb's Supper. That'll keep you busy for a few months. <br>  <br>  You can email me (click on my picture) and I'll hook you up with a Catholic yahoo group who have a few who are preparing for conversion. Unfortunately there is quite a bit of anti-catholic bigotry on Yahoo! Answers which I am sure is filling up your question right now as I type. <br>  <br>  Regarding confession -- no, you can't go -- yet.<br>  <br>  Again, congrats, and welcome home to the church!
V8Lyc2Jlaa	America was formed by immigrants. As is the case everywhere, immigrants are either people who couldn't bear to live back home, cause it was to oppressive/ medieval/ dangerous etc., or who didn't stand a shot in their old countries because they were uneducated/ dumb/ lazy/ creeps and sought their fortune elsewhere.<br>  They married, they had kids, the ones turned to be brilliant scientists etc, the others turned out christian. :-)|`|AA11297267	Yes, it's ironic.<br>  I personally think that at least some of the religious fundamentalism is a direct reaction to the advances we've made in the sciences...a backlash, so to speak.  With our uneven education system, the scientific knowledge we've gained doesn't always make its way to "the people" in an understandable form, and so when science appears to contradict beliefs the reaction is more extreme than it needs to be.  If we weren't making good scientific progress, there would probably be less of a reaction -- and nothing to fight against.  Where there's little progress, there's no reason to fear the change progress brings...<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|AA11367986	Maybe America's greatness comes FROM her belief in God.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord"|`|RVsl8ZKfaa	The US really isn't that great, it just sucks less than most of the other countries.<br>  <br>  [edit:] Also, your first sentence is debatable.|`|XxWovDNCaa	That is a conundrum to be certain.<br>  Luckily, the number of these people is declining.|`|AA10096992	In many ways, we've succeeded in spite of widespread human stupidity.|`|qSHO1wQtaa	Sorry to show you reality, but the US isn't great and has not made the greatest of contributions to science, technology, and medicine.

Those stories linking Jesus to have a relationship with Mary Magdalene and they brought children into the world were pure invention and most came mainly from Gnostic ideas in the early century and they had nothing to do with Christianity. Its primary goal is to destroy Christianity. The early Christians didn't have anything to do with it.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11.

Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

6w1e6zUVaa	Yes they do.... however most won't.  The irony is that most never question.  Which means that if Judaism was the first religion taught to them they'd most likely think the same thing, "Don't question just believe."|`|TEX1iYQgaa	What makes you so sure we haven't?<br>  <br>  The problem with liberals and with atheists, is that they are incapable of doing things like that. They don't have the intellectual honesty required to use the same level of scrutiny on their own position as they do on their opponents' <br>  <br>  Christians on the other hand, by very nature are a self-examining group. A lot of us do question our beliefs, we do want to know why, and we do want answers that make sense. Our beliefs are made stronger because of our intellectual honesty and our critical thinking.|`|WwCBomTMaa	Absolutely. I try to learn from those that do not share my beliefs.

But objectivity is a tall order.|`|PE7OS0f6aa	Yes, sure.  Why not.|`|aLmfkOcFaa	I don't think we owe it to ourselves. But we should defenitly try to look trhough the eyes of an atheist sometimes. I mean, when you're arguing with an atheist, it's hard to convince them of God's existince by merely saying "it's in the bible". One thing that I've discussed plenty of times is creation vs the big bang theory. I mean, look at it this way, at the very basis of both theories, something is being created. But, the big bang theory doesn't go any further than "two atoms hit each other in a vast space that didn't even exist yet until the two atoms hit each other to make that space" whereas creation has a creator, someone outside creation, that made everything. To me the creation story is just much more believable than the big bang theory. But yes, I do look from the ourside in, and you know what I see? I see a bunch of people, loving, working, eating, fellowshipping together, no matter their skin color or sex. What I see is a religion of love. And that's with as little bias as I can muster.|`|KgCUpE5naa	As a member of the media, I've had to teach myself to be objective in difficult situations.<br>  <br>  From the outside looking in, it often looks as though Christians are trying to control everything. So it's reasonable to see why people may dislike them<br>  <br>  However, from the inside looking out, TRUE Christians are simply trying to live their lives in peace, and build a better world for our children. Just as you will try to fight to impose your beliefs, we will fight to retain ours. <br>  <br>  Some Christians, though, do take it a little too far. But then again, there are extremists on all sides.|`|YLUeS2MOaa	Well I used to be a practicing catholic, back when my family could make me go to church. But after reading the bible recently, and examining it literally, I simply can't believe these stories anymore. There are so many fantastic things that happen in the bible, and religious people just take it at its word. If someone had tried to invent Christianity today, you'd be a youtube laughing stock. People just didn't know any better back then, and had no scientific understanding of the world. Nobody knew why volcanic eruptions and tsunamis and earthquakes and plagues and all other natural disasters happened, so religion was invented to give humans all the answers.|`|l6Jew1qAaa	It would be great if it were possible.

I've been a Christian all my life, but have attended many non-Christian events and services, and am active in interfaith events. I'm questioning my beliefs right now, and am looking at a wide variety of alternative paths. One thing that I'm finding helpful is to break Christianity down into its various doctrines and examine them as if I've never heard of them before. I ask myself, "Do I really believe this?" Sometimes, the answer is "yes", but many times it's "no". Taking a serious inventory of one's beliefs is good for everybody, not just Christians.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Not sure what you mean by that.

But when it came to the last, it was taking a little longer. <br>  She was inside for about twenty-five minutes, yeah it was a little long, but she figured he would be okay. That was until the office was disturbed by the sound of multiple sirens in the parking lot. <br>  <br>  So when she went outside she could see a frantic woman screaming at officers and paramedics that there was a child locked alone in a truck, my mum's truck. <br>  <br>  So my mum stepped over to the woman who was intent upon officers breaking the windows immediately.. and was attempting to unlock the door, but was cut off to be lectured by the woman and even an officer stepping in to talk about child and infant safety even when you think you're not going to be that long... now all of this could and probably should have applied to Rudolpho as well...  <br>  <br>  but almost everyone on the scene, couldn't help but breakout in laughter, when she finally opened the door and they found out that Rudolpho was a pekingese. <br>  <br>  ...

We where gonna go clubbing with our friend that went to a near by college. Well We got off work at 10 and we where on our way. So Here I am sayin oh oh I know a short cut and got us lost in the middle of no where but we finaly find our way back and carrie says lets just go the easy way forget the short cuts. So our friend calls us and says well just meet at the club and gives us directions. In comes our first run in with the cops. We pull up to a road block and they ask for my drivers licence. I hand it to them and he says why are yall all the way in Bougaloosa. I do not get along good with cops...So I smart off and say "To party with a friend that goes to Pearl River. That a problem" Well he lets us go and we get to the club. (note that if you have never been to bougaloosa OMG is smells so bad, like rotten butt) Ok so back to the club....we get there are its this little whole in the wall, that honestly looks like if you go in....your not coming out. ITS A DUMP.  So it takes 8 bucks to get in which leave us with 4 dollars total. We meet up with our friend and she is drunk and we are like dude seriously we just spent 8 bucks to get into this **** hole? Well our friend is like well lets go back to my dorm. BTW I left out a important part of the story. I had a huge crush on this girl we went to see lol. We go back through the road block and they see my drunk friend in the back seat and they ask me if I am drinking 2. I say " you can't be serious, I just came though here are 15 minutes ago, you really think something has changed since then?"  They give me a breathalizer, I pass of course. They tell us tp be careful and we are on our way. We get back to the dorm and our friend says " its cool yall can come up, but if we see the campus police yall gotta hide" so we do... We stay there hanging out for about an hour. Then The campus police knocks on the door, She hides us in the closet because we are not suppost to be there this late.  After the campus police leaves me and carrie high step it to my car and leave. We think we are in the clear when we mear the exit and who is sitting there in there...the damn campus police. He asks where we are heading and we say home and he is like oh ok yall are staying at your house tonight instead of the dorm, we look at each other and just say yea....Then he saya ok well let me see your college ids and you can go.... Umm yea we didn't have college ids. SOOO he makes us get out of the car. and he says do yall have any drugs or anything I should know about. and we didnt. He says I can take you to jail for tresspassing and I am like dude chill we were just dropping our friend off she was drunk and we wanted to walk her up to her room and make sure she was ok."

It was in Orlando, all women company of recruits. About the fifth week in training, most of my company is gone, working at various jobs around the base. Six key recruits, the ones I depended on to actually run the company, were in the barracks. As I entered and went down the passageway to the compartment, as I neared the corner that led to my office, I hear the unmistakeable (and loud!) sounds of a woman having one hell of an orgasm.<br>  I stopped...if I caught one of my recruits doing the dirty, I'd have to send her back in training, meaning I'd lose her. What to do, what to do?<br>  While I'm dithering, the sounds die down...and then I hear all six of the recruits laughing, and my Yeoman (company clerk) says, "That was nothing...check this out" and she starts in to HER version.<br>  Fake orgasm contest. (I used to think women were so innocent!)<br>  So I came around the corner, got to my office door before they noticed me.<br>  "Attention on deck," one shouted, and they all, blushing, came to attention.<br>  Ordinarily I would have immediately said "At ease," but I couldn't resist.<br>  Once I sat at my desk, I deliberately said, "Carry on."<br>  They all scooted towards the door, and I - in my parade ground voice - called 'em back to attention.<br>  "Evidently you have forgotten the meaning of 'Carry on,'" I growled. "Carry on" means to continue what you were doing before you came to attention."<br>  Then I leaned back in my chair, pointed at the Yeoman, and in a light voice said, "Yeoman, I believe you werre up?"<br>  She bolted, the other five just about died laughing.<br>  It took the Yeoman a couple of days to forgive me, but it was worth it!|`|qMcTeBavaa	The process of attaching the drywall to the stud is known as screwing off. It's easiest with two people. One to hold it in place while the other one screws it to the stud. My boss happened by a few seconds after my coworker had run out of screws. I explained the predicament. He told me to "Stop screwing off and start screwing off!" <br>  <br>  There was also "Catch Damon in his Underwear week." For five straight days, it seemed like I couldn't keep my pants on. From a coworker walking in as I changed from shorts to jeans, to having to make a quick change from shorts to jeans while a coworker drove, to my belt giving way in a client's office.<br>  <br>  To give a backstory on the last of that week. My boss hated the multitool I carried. He actually threatened to fine me for using it. There might have been a few drinks involved, but I spotted something I couldn't resist while I was shopping.

VgHU5b70aa	Well, it depends on his personality. If he's the sporty type then you could always get him a football or soccer ball or you could also try tickets to the next football, or basketball game. If he's more of the funny type then I would suggest maybe a funny card or maybe a simple fart machine or a more mature joke book. Lastly, if he's the sensitive, caring type I would try his favorite wine/beer or a caring card since you haven't seen him in awhile.

However your question is a little narrow as you assume those that do would be believing in Christianity (choosing my words deliberatly).|`|qTRzRi8gaa	I'm not a Christian, but I believe in a higher power.  It's complicated, though.  I don't really believe it cares all too much about our personal affairs.<br>  <br>  Basically it's like this.  The Universe is one giant, interconnected system ordered and made possible by natural law.  Without natural law, there could only be chaos.  Thus, there is something that allows everything to exist as it does, ordering it and giving constancy to all things.<br>  <br>  That force which orders the Universe is my vision of 'God'.  Therefore, God, to me, is simply natural order.  The Predatory tiger feasting on the gazelle, the blades of grass swaying in the wind, it's all 'God', or at least, a part of God, because 'God' is what makes it all possible, in my belief.  Therefore, God would essentially be the interconnectedness of all things in the Universe, as everything exists in a sort of harmony.  Anything that is 'wrong' or 'evil' would simply be that which disrupts of destroys that harmony.  It's pretty naturalistic.  I often see nature as a primary means of seeing divinity in the world.<br>  <br>  But, God doesn't necessarily have self awareness, or a will of it's own, in my belief.  It may, or it may not.

Most of the conflict really, is with people outside of the LGBT community who feels somehow gays or gay men are breaking some fictitious rule of _od. But everyone has a right to believe whatever they want, right or wrong. <br>  So no, we don't have a problem with our sexuality and _od, and we know so many people do have a problem with us.

mptnpn9maa	You know you are unconditionally loved when the person who cares for you allows you to be you, appreciates the person you are despite differences you share. When someone values another, faults and all and there are no conditions, that's unconditional love.<br>  <br>  You know you are unconditionally loved when you do something you recognize as less than perfect and your loved one doesn't judge you or make you feel stupid or judged. Oddly enough, once you recognize the pure nature of their love, you may just feel badly anyway because you did the "bad/foolish thing" and they still love you none the less.|`|YUAegpPoaa	I think UW is right.<br>  <br>  I think it exists and until you have tested it unconditional feels no different than conditional love.

In my experience, quite a few people talk about loving unconditionally, but not all that many actually do it.  If you're the one who is giving the unconditional love, you know you're doing it, and from what I've seen, it's possible to love yourself, your fellow human beings and everything in God's creation unconditionally.  Thanks for asking this question, and best wishes to you!|`|AA10847209	Hmm. I think my little dog "loves" me at least semi unconditionally; don't know about anyone else.

And as most of us didn't in fact receive it as children (even if our myth-making selves are convinced we did - because, for example, being 'very much cared for' often means ' being kept as a good girl/boy close to parents so you could never go out and discover who you really are'), we find it pretty difficult to give or experience receiving it as adults.  Which doesn't mean we can't work towards it.<br>  <br>  And I'd say being sick for a year is a darn good test of someone else's capacity for semi-unconditional love.  If the person finds their own inner 'stuff' being too challenged (eg because they're not getting what they feel they need from you), then the love wasn't adequately unconditional in the first place.  But the difficulty is always in finding the place that really is 'loving unconditionally' rather than being co-dependent, collusive or whatever.<br>  <br>  Ah well, that's not what you asked.  What does it feel like to receive it?  I only know this in odd moments, largely with my best friend rather than a lover.  I still worry that she'll get fed up with me, though.  I suspect the fault is in me rather than any lack of unconditional love on her part.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, I think I'm only saying that this is too difficult to answer without a ten-hour rambling conversation.  It's the most complex human emotion, the one we most need and long for and I suspect I can only grope towards understanding it by testing what I might think against someone else's response, again and again.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Actually, I think Siva said what I've said, only more succinctly.|`|83zdE9rTaa	It seems the closest we get to even observing it is when we see "Mother and Child".   (I love my wife unconditionally, but she probably doesn't know that for sure; and visa versa I think.)<br>  <br>  Edit: What Jeffiner said is included in my book "Love and Optical illusions".  The problem with her strategy is that it can lead to "I will test my mate's love by being mean or cranky or worse,  and if my mate still loves me (after that)  I will know he/she loves me unconditionally"  --- Sometimes the plan works and sometimes (most of the times) it leads to a separation and even a "reverse heartache".<br>  <br>  Edit: "After being sick for a year"?  If this applies to you, we need to ask ourselves "Who is really being tested?" (If my wife was sick for a year, My love for her would grow stronger, if she gave me a chance for my love to grow for her. I feel that any man's love would grow stronger under that circumstance if his wife gave his love a chance to grow. )|`|BLnXhWoTaa	[i had a very long response that i just deleted... let me think over a cigarette...]<br>  ok, i think i have it now.  all hail nicoteinos, god of burning tobacco!<br>  <br>  puppy love is kind of like idolatry.  it puts the object above the subject.  it would feel flattering at first, but like all things that remain constant, you would begin to take it for granted or even eventually resent it.  you'd know it from whether he puts you at the center of his life or maintains his own separate interests.<br>  <br>  all relationships should be built on equality and mutual consent, regardless of the level of intimacy.  so, maybe he feels like he made a mistake and wants to patch things up; just make sure you're consenting.  don't let guilt or pity lead either of you on.|`|UjWlvh1naa	when no matter what happens , no matter what you do, they still love you the same.|`|QC7vlfPPaa	The love of a parent who has raised you is (usually) unconditional.

Most people when they love seek some form of gratitude or reward for their love. Sometimes immediately and some think they will be rewarded in the next life.<br>  But for unconditional love to occur it is not a question of reward or reciprocation. Rather it is the act of loving itself, even if it's unrecognised. Whilst i believe such a thing exists i cannot say it is common.<br>  <br>  As how to recognise such serendipity, well that is beyond my experience.<br>  <br>  (((Angels))) <br>  <br>  _()_

Eventually, she dragged me down with her.  *I* would start looking for things to complain about.  It made me a very unhappy individual.

I watched the show when it first came out, and I haven't watched it since.  The show is just a mockery of what true love should be.  Those women on the show knew ahead of time their feelings would be hurt and they went through with it anyway.  But back to my original point, it just has to do with the show being popular for this particular season.  I'm not into it either, and I have seen many make such a big deal over nothing.  Even on yahoo's front page I saw a picture and an article about it.  My suggestion to you is to ignore it.  Eventually the hype will die down.  Look at American Idol for example, when it first came out, it was the rave of the U.S. now it has lost a lot of ratings.  Everything has a time and a season.

If you push yourself on someone then they may feel intimidated by you or end up being with you because they feel like they have to. Try getting to know the person real well and go from there. Conversation is the best thing. Find out what he likes and doesn't like, throw in some things you like, flirt a little and walk away if he comes back to you then pursue it, if not then find someone else you don't feel you need to convince.

On the other hand, tattoos are reasonably permanent, so you should be sure that you want it and that it will look good for a long time.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	it's your body and you aren't hurting anyone so why not?

It is all about loving your fellow man enough to care whether they have food to eat and clothes to wear and shelter... and not worry about the small stuff and just do your best to be a good example of kind and loving behavior.|`|tk9UWU4Waa	I would say No. In the bible it doesnt directly say that tatoos are bad but it does say "to keep the temple of the lord clean and pure without markings."

As nature worshippers they often have knowledge of herbs with which they can treat various illnesses and conditions.I the middle ages they would have seemed like magic. It was the Christian church that demonised them in an effort to get pagans to come to the christian church. People were very superstitious in the old days which is why people like Mathew Hopkirk the self appointed witch-finder general were  able to make money out of persecuting and having murdered innocent people all over East Anglia. They do not actually work real magic or cast real spells|`|iXI7n6Gmaa	Yes, they are for real<br>  <br>  there many types and they work.<br>  <br>  One is doing miraculous acts this rare and not obvious to people<br>  One type is deceiving the eyes most obvious to people<br>  Most popular but not so obvious is changing the chemistry in your body to be sick or change your likes and dislikes.<br>  <br>  all the above are illegal as they almost always require the help of demons and when you poke the demons the evil first come to the intended to but then sooner or later it will return to the originator in a worse measure.|`|9it5nGJjaa	Yes. If you believe in them, it will work. The ones that don't work are love spells/charms, hexes, and curses. If you do any of those, you'll get it back times three.

Most of the spells found in witchcraft are very vague and open to interpretation. In other words, I could say that you are going to die and I'd be right. I never said when, I just said that you would. Just the same as a "seer of the future" can say "you will fall in love" and not say when or that the relationship would work out. It is left very open to interpretation so that they can be right 98% of the time. The spells work the same way. There are spells to make people fall in love with you, and if the spells don't work the book says "you weren't believing hard enough." There's always an excuse. I wouldn't waste my time with it if I was you. And if someone puts a hex on you, laugh. You'll live.|`|tk9UWU4Waa	yes, it is real.

AA11923447	Sometimes. Normally, it's not my favorite genre, but there are moments when it's very appropriate. I'm a classical musician, and can appreciate certain trends in metal toward dark, symphonic sound and rhythmic complexity.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	Don't care for it.|`|45d9fceab12827344dbecb725d325592aa	be careful music puts off good and bad vibes.

However I think that it takes talent to create any kind of music.|`|TzY9vkinaa	not usually|`|4VouLn4waa	That all depends on what you define has heavy. If your thinking lof bands like White Capel as being heavy then no that is not beautiful nor does it take much talent. The vocalist can only scream lows from what i have heard every 5 seconds there is a breakdown. That goes for most death metal bands. And thrash metal is a completely different genre. Bands like metallica (kill em all- ...and justice for all) can be considered thrash metal, and they are not heavy at all compared to most metalcore, grindcore, metal, and screamo bands. <br>  I do love it though. I prefer bands to not speak directly about God because that can kill a song. Its fine if they speak about him in a not obvious way like As I lay Dying and The Devil Wears prada. But its all good|`|pqveENjUaa	I definitely appreciate it. Not my favorite, but it is great. My favorite parts are rapid (and i mean blazing fast) chord progressions or arppegios (i think thats how its spelled?)<br>  <br>  Personally though, I prefer breathy music with an ancient feel to it, like the ending part of Aerials by System of a Down|`|gKwKxJyNaa	honestly it scars me...only because of the loud music, i'm more of an Alternative type of girl...but hey music is music and it's amazing that they can creat such....unique music|`|AA10075527	RARELY !|`|PKsldf8Caa	I love it....that's all there is to it.|`|Fm7z09Kwaa	Nope|`|v80N4JB0aa	It is the Best, I love it alll!!|`|IeTAvwpbaa	I don't really like it. It sounds angry to me.|`|tk9UWU4Waa	As long as the lyrics are praising God then there is nothing wrong with it. I'm 19 years old and my dad plays the drums in A hard Rock/ Metal band. I hear people all the time saying thats not right to do, but nowhere in the bible does it say "thou shalt not headbang" As the lead guitarist in his band would say, "lets take the message to the masses!"
iZrNlSIJaa	I think the idea of a pen pal is a great one because it is a good way to learn about other cultures. However, the idea of an inmate pen pal makes me uneasy because they are part of the criminal element, and some of these people are not sorry for what they've done. I understand that they may be lonely in prison and would like communication with the "outside," but it isn't enough to tug my heartstrings. I don't have a desire to purposely and knowingly communicate with a criminal, reformed or not.|`|O4jGlC2caa	Yes, as long as the person on the outside approaches it with caution.  No last names.  No actual address or phone number on the letter.  I would want to know who I am writing to.  If I am writing to a woman who's only crime is killing her husband who abused her for years, that's one thing.  (Yeah, such woman do go into jail if they, say, shoot the husband in his sleep rather than shooting him as he is attacking her.)<br>  <br>  On the other hand, I would not write to a rapist, child molester, or murderer.|`|f48d10d4bec5b5e25f9894010aed2c69aa	yes. most inmates have depression and other mental illnesses. they need help and any way to make them feel like someone cares is a good thing.|`|AA11605393	NO <br>  <br>  bad idea--sets you up with criminals...why would you want to do that? put yourself in danger like that?!|`|ZhhH5cAdaa	Yes!<br>  <br>  It stops the inmates from going thru the yellow pages and calling me!<br>  If I have to ever explain to my husband again that I don't know these people, I will scream.<br>  <br>  But on the con side, they sort of prey on desperate women.|`|p3tVyimaaa	yes, if inmates are writing it keeps them occupied, if their occupied writing, their staying out of trouble, which means I'm not getting shanked.|`|ErRrJ2tbaa	Yes if it is used to rehabilitate inmates. Meaning to help them work out there issues.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	I think it is outrageous and should be stopped. And it attracts lonely women in desperate search of love and the inmates feed on that and use the woman for whatever they can get. As for someone coming from the USA to Ireland and the "lol" a man from Scotland traveled to the USA and attempted to kill Teresa Saldana an aspiring actress and he stabbed her multiple times and only the intervention of a passerby saved her life, also the man who killed John Lennon traveled to NY to attain his goal, people, if they are disturbed enough, will travel anywhere in the world so distance does not guarantee safety, "LoL."|`|aZXnW6AUaa	yes

It is simply a Western 21st-Century Orientalist viewpoint which sees Islam as existing in a hermetically-sealed bubble unaffected by the change of time, even though the Western view of Islam at the beginning of the 20th Century was very different from today.|`|VBYEE67Caa	Christians/non christian and every other kind of belief/non belief society had their time too(killing innocents) Haven't we learned yet that people are people and that like liquor, drugs, and the devil made me do it, politics, bad marriage, bad upbringing, poor, rich etc..religion is used as an excuse to go ahead and do what they want.  <br>  <br>  personally, i don't waste my time hating<br>  <br>  Love.

But I think that Christianity probably gets the most world-wide hatred. <br>  <br>  And if I can point out something, it's really only the radicals that are so constantly portrayed in the media that are out killing people. True followers of Islam aren't trying to kill everyone they don't like. Just the ones who have taken the holy scriptures out of context. Just like the radical Christians who are killing children in Africa under the belief that the poor kids are witches raining torment on the country side.|`|l6Jew1qAaa	Really? They [Christians] started it. Check the history of the Crusades. Check out the Inquisition. Extremists from any religion...markedly Christian and Islamic...will stop at nothing, using their religion as a shield and an excuse for their bad behavior. Many of the white "hate" groups base their propaganda on so called Christian beliefs. Their precepts are skewed so out of proportion they are unrecognizable to most Christians, yet they call it "Christian." I personally am a Christian, but I am one that believes we should love one another as brothers and sisters, no matter what color, ethnic background, other religion, or whatever; and we should not judge others. I don't hate Islam or any other religion...I do hate extremism that leads to killing and gives [whatever] religion a bad name. You are right...Caucasians Rock...but so do everyone else!|`|KGhA6cWwaa	no, innocent killing is in no way restricted to a single religion, where did you get that rubbish? <br>  there are murderers who are Christian. and virtually all other religions.<br>  I can think of one specific group, in the recent past who used bombs and attacks on civilians to achieve political goals, staunchly christian.<br>  they were the IRA. does this make all Catholics killers? <br>  No. because a single extreme group does not represent anyone who follows their religion.<br>  <br>  I think islam is one of the better religions, few religions teach their members to be as respectful or do as much good.|`|AA11668191	No, but I'd say Islam is easily the most feared, mostly because Westerners don't know very about it. It's not that there isn't anything to fear, only that there is a blanket fear of the whole religion because of a few extremist groups. It'd be like if someone thought that the Branch Davidians in Waco represented Christianity as a whole.|`|kX0T1urdaa	Not just hates, but fears. Who needs someone wanting to chop your head off.<br>  <br>  The way they treat their own families is scary and disgusting. I just read about a man who killed his wife and 2 daughters and buried them.  <br>  <br>  Later when someone else was buried in the same area they found the girls alive. When asked how it was possible were alive, the girls said a man with nail prints in his hands fed them and kept them alive and kept their mother alive so she could feed the baby. This caused quite a stir in the Muslim community I can tell you. I still  have that story in my inbox. Later (I am at work now) I will copy paste the whole story so everyone can see it as it is written.<br>  <br>  A Muslim man in Egypt killed his wife because she <br>                    was reading the Bible and then buried her with their <br>                    infant baby and an 8-year old daughter.<br>                   <br>                    The girls were buried alive! He then reported to the police that an<br>                    uncle killed the kids. <br>                     <br>                    15days later, another family member died. When they went to bury<br>                    him, they found the 2 little girls under the sand - ALIVE!<br>                    The country is outraged over the incident, and the man will be<br>                    executed. The older girl was asked how she had survived and she says:- 'A man<br>                    wearing shining clothes, with bleeding wounds in his hands, came every  <br>                    day to feed us. He woke up my mom so she could nurse my sister,' <br>                    she said. She was interviewed on Egyptian national TV, by a veiled <br>                    Muslim woman news anchor.  She said on public TV, 'This was none other than  <br>                    Jesus, because  nobody else does things like this!' Muslims believe Isa (Jesus)<br>                    would do this, but the wounds mean He really was crucified, <br>                    and it's clear also that He is alive! But, it's also clear that the child could not<br>                    make up a story like this, and there is no way these children could have<br>                    survived without a true miracle.  Muslim leaders are going to have a hard time <br>                    to figure out what to do with this, and the popularity of the Passion movie doesn't help! <br>                    With Egypt at the center of the media and education in the Middle East , you can be sure this<br>                    story will spread.  Christ is still turning the world upside down!   <br>   <br>                    Please let this story be shared.

If they were, the media would be all over that like Oprah on a fake holocaust story.<br>  <br>  Compare that to the 4250 or so US soldiers that have died in Iraq since the conflict started.  Even if you assume that every one of those was killed by a Muslim (which they weren't), that's still far, far fewer Americans killed in Iraq than are killed in the US every year.<br>  <br>  The fact is that Christian Americans are killing a awful lot of innocent people every day.<br>  <br>  The highest number is India though - and admittedly at least some of those are probably Muslims.|`|RVsl8ZKfaa	Approximately 17,000  murders occur each year in the US alone.

VLcDWWwmaa	Creole is mixed with African languages.|`|YaMdGqxlaa	There are several creole languages derived from English, French, Portuguese and Dutch. French-based creoles are spoken in formerly French islands in the Indian Ocean,  in the French-speaking Caribbeans and in Louisiana. All these creoles have similarities but they are not necessarily mutually understandable. <br>  <br>  Creole languages contain words from Africa and the words of French origin have been modified over time especially since they were spoken by illiterate people. They cannot be understood by French speakers.<br>  <br>  Here is an example: Ba moin en ti bo (créole martiniquais) Donne-moi un petit baiser.|`|2jeyswNSaa	creole tiny island <br>  France country

I know what you're looking fo, you want him to say it, you want him to tell you he doesn't want you, that he doesn't love you so he hurts you enough to go on. Reread what you wrote to us, he didn't fight for you, he is not interested in returning your calls. That is him TELLING you that he does not love you, need you or want anything to do with you. What more do you want, the last word, prove to him that you're better off. Honey you have to prove that to yourself first. What is there to fix....nothing.

He isnt Superman and he cant save you or help you move on. <br>  You need you to move on. You are the only person that can do it. If you need help, ask one of your friends.

NYU37jfGaa	It is not known for certain if they were lovers, but they very likely were. They first met in 1774, at a masked ball.  In 'Marie Antoinette', Joan Haslip writes:<br>  <br>  'The eighteen-year-old count Fersen, on his first visit to Paris, was handsome enough to attract the attention of any woman.  His tall, elegant figure, his perfect features and vivid blue eyes framed by long black lashes had already earned him the name of "La Beau Fersen" and an air of cool reserve gave him an added fascination.  The Swedish ambassador, Count Creutz, reported to King Gustavus "Of all the Swedes who have passed through Paris since I have been here, no one has been so well received as young Count Fersen nor behaved with a greater modesty and discretion." '<br>  <br>  Axel Fersen left Paris in the spring of 1774, and returned four years later.  Joan Haslip writes:<br>  <br>  'The Swedish uniform of the King's dragoons, with its blue cloak, white tunic, tight chamois breeches and dashing shako with its blue and yellow plumes and been specially designed by King Gustavus to show off the fmale figure to the greatest advantage.  when worn by Count Fersen at the Queen's levee it attracted the attention of every woman in theroom, beginning with the Queen.  Those who were close to her noted her sudden blush, the slight trembling of her hand, the look of suppressed excitement, which lasted no more than a moment before she had regained her self-control and the usual smiling mask with which she greet4ed distinguished foreigners.  Perhaps she lingered too long and took too great an interest in the details, for by the end of the day every courtier at Versailles was aware that young Count Fersen was the Queen's new favourite.'<br>  <br>  Fersen returned to the French court with the King of Sweden on several occasions, and each time it was clear that Marie Antoinette was very attracted to him.  When he returned to FRance in 1787, he sepnt a lot of time at Versailles.  Joan Haslip writes:<br>  <br>  'That Fersen not only went to vERsailles but actually stayed there is evident from letters addressed to his sister.  Behind the state apartments was a warren of small rooms and secret staircases.  Besenval was the first to note the existence of these secret rooms when he was once summoned to a privat audience by the Queen and was sufficiently indiscreet to suggest that Marie Antoinette may have had an intimate life unsuspected by her court.  <br>  <br>  But in spite of all the evidence one is inclined to doubt that Fersen and Marie Antoinette were lovers in these crucial years of 1787-9, when the situation was deteriorating so rapidly that it needed all the Queen's energy and willpower to support a vacilating king and a supine archbishop.'<br>  <br>  Joan Haslip believed that Fersen and the Queen became lovers in 1790.  She writes:<br>  <br>  'Fersen returned to Paris in January 1790 entrusted with a secret mission from King Gustiavus, who no longer trusted his official ambassador.  Fersen remained in paris throughout the following year, a year that saw the full flowering of his amatory relations with the Queen.  There can be little doubt that they became lovers.  In the Tuileries Marie Antoinette looked upon herself as a prisoner who had the right to seize every opportunity for freedom.  What as Queen of France she might have denied herself at Versailles would in her eyus have been permissible at the Tuileries.  Fersen appears to have had no difficulty going in and out of the palace at all hours of the day and night.  In April 1790 he wrote to his sister, Counterss Sophie Piper, "I am a little happier, for from time to time I am able to see her quite freely in her apartments, and this consoles us slightly for all the unpleasantness she has to put up with."  Naturally there was gossip.  The Comete de Saint Priest thought it his duty to tell the Queen that a guard had seen Count Fersen leaving the palace at three in the morning, and had been about to arrest him.  The Count should be warned that his continual visits to the palace would end by getting him in trouble.  But all that Marie Antoinette replied was "Tell him if you must.  Persoanlly I could not care less."  And the visits continued as before.'<br>  <br>  Axel Fersen was involved in the bungled attempt by the royal family to escape from Paris, but the King refused to let him accompany the disguised royal party any further than the first relay station at Bondy.  He may have thought that Fersen would be too conspicuous, being a foreigner, or he may even have been a little jealous of him, if he knew of Marie Antoinette's infatuation with him.<br>  <br>  Fersen returned to France again in 1792 with another plan of escape, but was never able to carry it out.  He seems to have continued to hope to the end that he would be able to rescue the Queen, but his plans came to nothing.|`|9Nw85MAdaa	Well, I recently read "Marie Antoinette: The Journey" by Antonia Frasier and she depicts him as a real person and even includes a picture of a small framed portrait of him. She mentions him continuously. This book is a brilliantly researched biography.<br>  <br>  In "The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette" by Carolly Erickson, he is mentioned numerous times. (This is a historical fiction, but well  researched book)<br>  <br>  Finally, there is the movie, which he is in. Of course, this is a movie, but it took a lot of factual information.<br>  <br>  So, we can conclude that he was real and had some sort of connection to the queen. Whether they were so deeply emotionally involved, I suppose we can never know for sure.|`|KIalyEVyaa	Count Axel von Fersen was a Swedish solider who Marie Antoinette met at a masked ball she was not supposed to attend. She found him very attractive and them met again a few years later. It is speculated they had affairs and that the dauphin of france and marie terese were his children because until he received surgery, Louis XVI was infertile.

It's believed God assigns each individual his/her freedom and responsibilities (basically, their deeds are independent of others).<br>  <br>  Satan:<br>  The Bible views Satan as the fallen angel, while the Qur'an views Satan as a jinn, a different class from angels.<br>  <br>  That's about all I can remember.

This also includes placing additional marks on the address portion of the letter or mailed object, called "bar coding." Bar coding of mail for delivery is usually expressed either by a series of vertical bars, usually called POSTNET coding, or a block of dots as a two-dimensional barcode. The "block of dots" method allows for the encoding of proof of payment of postage, exact routing for delivery, and other features.

In fact this name was shared by three mythic characters.

Diodorus Siculus made an attempt to define each of these three (although it is clear he also became muddled), and his opinion is followed here.<br>  <br>   Briefly, the first Aeolus was a son of Hellen and eponymous founder of the Aeolian race; the second was a son of Poseidon, who led a colony to islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea; and the third Aeolus was a son of Hippotes who is mentioned in Odyssey book 10 as Keeper of the Winds who gives Odysseus a rightly closed bag full of the captured winds so he could sail easily home to Ithaca on the gentle West Wind. All three men named Aeolus appear to be connected genealogically, although the precise relationship, especially regarding the second and third Aeolus, is often ambiguous.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thanasis.com/winds.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thanasis.com/winds.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/agodsandgoddesses/g/Aeolus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/agods...</a><br>  <br>  Halcon|`|kDnN2AoNaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolus" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolus</a>|`|o4UrRbTvaa	<a href="http://www.gods-heros-myth.com/godpages/aeolus.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gods-heros-myth.com/godpages/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.theoi.com/Titan/Aiolos.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theoi.com/Titan/Aiolos.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Mythology/Aeolus.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Mythology/...</a><br>  <a href="http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/agodsandgoddesses/g/Aeolus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/agods...</a>

AA11608181	I understand what people say about not flaunting your holiness, so to speak.  I dislike it when people ask me in person what I'm giving up for Lent because it does feel like bragging, when it should in fact be an act of contrition, humility, and striving towards God.  At the same time, I feel a little more comfortable with it online because it's anonymous and also because I feel there are people out there who can benefit from seeing examples of what might be done and why.  It's not always just about giving things up.  For that reason, I will let you know that I am doing three things for Lent this year.<br>  <br>  1. I'm not eating between meals -  I'm doing this as a form of self-discipline and because for me it serves as a constant reminder of the season.<br>  <br>  2. I've resolved to increase my prayer life by praying to God at least twice every day.  I figure if I can make God a more active part of my life, it will be easier to live it in accordance to His wishes.<br>  <br>  3. I have decided to focus on becoming a more patient person, especially in my interactions with other people.  I shouldn't be so quick to judge or take offense since it only damages my relations with them.  I want to live a more Christian life.|`|WjRqYf6naa	I'm not a Catholic, but let me just say that I admire the discipline involved in the Lenten observance.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	<a href="http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/2009/02/27/what-to-give-up-for-lent/" rel="nofollow">http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/2009/0...</a>|`|ee132737d0e2aeb1472848f439feaf8aaa	Im sorry if it sounds rude but yes we are not suppose to tell what were giving up eventhough most of us do..me included ooppss.

gmaCvh00aa	I don't like segregation simply because it can prevent you from meeting people with whom you might have the potential to become  friends, or even fall in love.<br>  <br>  Segregation doesn't work.  Let's just bury that idea for once and for all.|`|AA10866651	There is no such thing as "equal" segregation.  The U.S. proved that segregation didn't work, which is why it LEGALLY ended back in the 60's.  And there are more races and cultures than just black and white in this country, so black people need to stop acting like racism is all about just them.  White people just need to get a clue.<br>  <br>  If you are so unhappy with the state of race relations in this country, and so hung up on being around only black people, then the ideal solution for you would be to relocate yourself to a country where there are ONLY black people.  Seriously, nobody and nothing is stopping you from getting a passport and leaving the U.S. to go experience how life is somewhere else.  Because all you are doing right now is complaining......|`|dcovK6oqaa	I think that segregation its wrong and stupid. Because we have to learned to live with everyone. not just black people. all types of races. Perhaps God made us different so we learned to accept one another and love one another.|`|8MzVCzi0aa	yeah i try to segregate all the colors in my M & Ms<br>  works too. i start by eating all the yellows|`|9cadfad24a0e7d1fe4d7c324765c15fbaa	My Opinion On Segregation Is This. It's Wrong Let Everyone Be Everyone. There Shouldn't be anymore white on white or black on black in fact In today's society granted there's still racism, You see more Interracial relationships. I'm fine with it I'm Caucasian and I grew up around African Americans and Latinos So I have no problem with any race just a problem with ignorance which is in any race.|`|AA10937211	the schools in my area are kind of segregated. we have 2 towns in one county. the black people are staying at one school and whites are moving their kids to another school. in our sister county they have segregated proms. this country is just one big racial blur|`|cKuppxUQaa	Segregation would be taking a giant leap backwards.

I feel sorry for you. You're the "girl I would never want"
AA11923447	Yes. I got carried away at a large public demonstration, and found myself becoming verbally and physically abusive, just like the shouting, enraged mob around me.

Let's just say that, from it, I learned a valuable lesson.<br>  <br>  <br>  Added: You have asked a unique question. Although I am not pleased with drawing undue attention to myself, your post is worthy of a star. Your query deserves honest answers, and plenty of them. I am interested in seeing the answers you receive.|`|UWKF7x4faa	Yes, but only under the influence of alcohol.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	No, I have always been the voice of reason.|`|s1zitZMOaa	Actually I have in a way. This was not a riot of any kind but many years ago I was traveling and my flight was delayed and then delayed some more and so on. Anyway, it's a long story but I went up to ask the gate agents a question and they were really rude about it - when the other waiting passengers overheard them raising their voices and such they started getting up and walking over there. It went downhill really quickly but I remember that at first with all the other passengers starting to shout and throw fits it made me feel like I should be really angry with the situation too. <br>  <br>  I started raising my voice and waving my hands about too. But after a minute I realized that I had never been angry and I didn't know what I was so mad about all of the sudden. So I just backed up and stood away kind of mesmerized by it. I felt terrible about it because it was basically like I started it because I was up there first. But until all those people started going nuts I was completely calm. It was weird, really weird.<br>  <br>  edit - I'm like Red Queen here, I don't really want to call attention to my weird and unpleasant behavior but your question is quite interesting.|`|IJoM4Q50aa	I think there is no excuse for it.<br>  There is right and there is wrong. People that let them selves join in a mob/riot situation have not learned correct behaviors growing up.<br>  They don't think about the consequence of there actions because there was no serious consequences growing up when they did something wrong. <br>  These people lack self control and respect for others. <br>  I believe these are things that were not taught to them as a child. <br>  <br>  Just my opinion.|`|iu2hnHp7aa	rabble rabble rabble rabble|`|t88527U1aa	No I always had the good sense to get away from it!

But if it happened everyday it would soon lose all its excitement and you'd probably get to hate it!|`|2z1h5mfOaa	Because sometimes what we want isn't ours to get.  Because sometimes it's not right for us.  Because sometimes there's something else that would be better for us but we don't know it yet.  Because sometimes we think that is exactly what we want but maybe it isn't quite because we are not determined enough to get it.  Many more reasons...  And sometimes it's just bad luck.<br>  It's life!|`|kJUCZFwkaa	Γιατ? αυτ? ε?ναι πραγματικ?τητα, η ?ρα να ξυπν?σει.|`|P3JsbI7gaa	cuz lifes not fair.  sucks right|`|aPcw0sz7aa	Because life would be boring that way.

If two girls want the same guy, how would that work? especially if that guy doesnt want either of them lol|`|KszocgnSaa	Lol because you just can't. Humans are greedy by nature and they always want more and if you say otherwise your lying. Plus to get what you want you might be taking something from someone else which in turn wouldn't be fair. Your asking for something that isn't fair and although life isn't fair your asking for something that is very unfair. Why would who ever is up there or where ever give one person everything and not the rest...?

5BVZWhusaa	Stupidity is the property a person, action or belief instantiates by virtue of having or being indicative of low intelligence or poor learning abilities. Stupidity is distinct from irrationality because stupidity denotes an incapability or unwillingness to properly consider the relevant information. It is frequently used as a pejorative, and consequently has a negative connotation. The term has fallen out of favor in medical journals as it is seen as a generic term used to describe a wide variety of conditions.<br>  <br>  Stupidity is a noun of Latin origin representing a quality or state of being of being stupid, or an act or idea that exhibits properties of being stupid.[1] The root word stupid,[2] which can serve as an adjective or noun itself, comes from the Latin verb stupere, for being numb or astonished, and is related to stupor.[3]<br>  <br>  According to Merriam-Webster, the words "stupid" and "stupidity" enter the English language in 1541. Since then, stupidity has taken place along with "fool," "idiot," "dumb," and related concepts as a pejorative appellation for human misdeeds, whether purposeful or accidental, due to absence of mental capacity.<br>  <br>  The modern English word "stupid" has a broad range of application, from being slow of mind (indicating a lack of intelligence, care or reason), dullness of feeling or sensation (torpidity, senseless, insensitivity), or lacking interest or point (vexing, exasperating). It can either infer a congenital lack of capacity for reasoning, or a temporary state of daze or slow-mindedness.|`|bInF0Rhqaa	dictionary: n.

Catholics and Fundamentalists get the same treatment.<br>  <br>  My son and his family are LDS and I know that many of the things said about Mormons here are not true at all.

But yea some people do run other people's religions down not just ours, the LDS/ Mormon faith. There was some muslim guy running down Catholics one night. He posted a lot of inflammatory and BS questions about Catholics. I have a lot of respect for Catholic people. I've met a few online and one of them cheered up my mom when she was sad once so I stood up for the Catholics and said that he shouldn't run them down. I got blocked. heh. <br>  <br>  Then there was a Hindu person who posted a question as to why Christians call his religion a false religion. I said that I respected his faith as well and understood how it felt  to be called all sorts of things. <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqngFhJ07XqW9Lbnukz4pIzsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090301063523AAJklCO&show=7#profile-info-56f857adccfe97c5b5197529fd3759b6aa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  People who block LDS/Mormons from their question are obviously ego tripping.

Yea it's disappointing, but we can make up for it by posting questions that get to the truth of things.|`|AA11713693	Because people do know the truth about the mormon church and so that is why they do it. If they took the missionary discussions and found out what the mormon church is all about then they would not do it.|`|tRcO5uyiaa	I doubt very much that people would devote their day to spreading lies about the Mormon church. Many people believe that the Mormon religion is just a cast-off of the New Testament made up by men. I have researched this religion myself. It does seem very idealistic and I would never become part of something so ritualistic and perceptible. The one thing that bothers me about the Mormon religion is that the men believe that after they die, they become a god. My former employer is a Mormon. He told me that only a couple of weeks after I began working for his office. Regardless, I have no affinity to any religion. I prefer my belief system, simple and direct.<br>  <br>  There are many religions that are bashed (some far worse than Mormon). Catholic, Protestant,  Christianity (originally formed from Judaism), Judaism, Islam (Muslim), Hinduism.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	I usually tell myself that they're just confused.  Most of them have been told that we're a cult and that we believe in strange things all their lives, so of course they're afraid of us.  I just wish they could see past the fear and realize that none of the things they believe about us are actually true.  They'd probably be happier, and I know we would.<br>  <br>  And yes, it does happen to other religions.  Jehovah's Witnesses, Muslims, and agnostics and atheists (though I know they're not an actual religion) are attacked on this site all the time.  We just get the most crap, because the people who dislike our faith are usually the most ignorant, and ignorant people are often louder and more insistent to make up for the ignorance.  <br>  <br>  ...and Mormons are blocked for the same reason.  These people don't want to know the truth.  They'd rather hold on to their own false beliefs about ours, because if they actually listened to us and learned something, they'd have to stop heckling, and they don't want that.  I think mocking our sacred things is the only fun they get out of life.  Just ignore them and let them have their fun.  It'll get to the point where the trolls will only receive replies from other trolls, which may make them feel vindicated but won't increase the contention.|`|BMQlzUkfaa	Hate and bitterness<br>  Fear<br>  Narrow mindedness<br>  An "I'm always right" attitude<br>  Boredom<br>  <br>  These are a few of the things I came up with.

The Catholic Church had technically banned the practice of selling indulgences as long ago as 1567. <br>  <br>  As the Times points out, a monetary donation wouldn't go amiss toward earning an indulgence. It writes, "charitable contributions, ***combined with other acts***, can help you ***earn*** one."

bMuwuAVOaa	There are Urban legends that have been around a matter of a few years or even months. That being said I do not think that it is a story that lasts through the test of time as once such myths did. But the strength of the story. Peace&Love be with you...~M~|`|AiEGi0Zqaa	Well, legends do not necessarily have to be archaic, but the majority of popular ones are. That being said, there is no set timetable about when a story becomes a legend. The most essential aspect of the creation of a legend is that it must be shared throughout several generations of people (1 generation is roughly 20-25 years). That is how current generations of people are still familiar with the legends and myths of cultures that existed thousands of years ago. <br>  Also, a legend is typically only regarded as a myth if it (the legend) explains why something is "the way it is."|`|2vzj65Kfaa	Difficult question, that.<br>  <br>  In this day of mass communication and multimedia we don't have the oral tradition of passing along stories the way we used to.<br>  <br>  That being said, our new myths are emergin mostly in the media of movies.  The big block-buster movies that are enduring for decades as a cultural phenomenon is not entirely on accident.<br>  <br>  It is because they touch a nerve in the human collective unconscious that makes the old symbols new again.  Right down the line, the Star Wars trilogy (for instance) follows the same heroic myth that mythology has followed for thousands of years.<br>  <br>  Interestingly enough, Joseph Campbell came out with The Hero With a Thousand Faces in the late 1940's - and a man named Vogel rewrote it in the early 50's as a pamphlet to help screenwritiers write more exciting movie scripts.  It has influenced just about every successful script ever since.<br>  <br>  If you look at how Harry Potter books have not only struck the imagination of children, but crossed the barrier into practically being serious adult literature it is because there is something bigger than the vaneer of the magical world that Rowling weaves through the tales - it is that (consciously, or subconsciously) her stories follow the mythic journey and we relate to it on a deeper level.<br>  <br>  How long does it take?  Seems like just a few years.  'Jedi' is turning into a religion taken seriously by some.  Art imitates life imitates art, and so on and so on.|`|cgjbw1jKaa	many many moons on the third of nevermore|`|mnaNKujPaa	The word myth and legend have different meanings in different culture or areas of study.

(she wasn't a well person..)  and she drowned her child in a creek in our township...   this happened in the 50s.<br>  <br>  now it's a story that goes on endlessly with many versions...  and she died.. (don't remember how anymore.)  but now they say she haunts that creek and the bridge she stood on and you can hear the cries of the baby...<br>  <br>  they renamed the creek,  'crybaby creek'...   and many kids, couples go by there at certain times to spook each other out or  to bless their child or the birth of the child.. so the family will be protected in some weird way by the woman... (she was remorseful or something.. see, i can't remember any more...)   it's a blessing to void  themselves of tragedy like this one.. to make communication and to send their blessings to the mother and child who now haunt the creek ... so o n and on.. and   O  N    O   N...<br>  <br>  the stories are mixed up now.. and many are now saying it's a myth, it didn't happen..<br>  <br>  but i remember when the story came out of the woman and she turned herself in admitting to the murder  of her child.. and was convicted.. but later turned over to the state she wasn't fit to go to prison.. so on...<br>  <br>  wish i had all my facts straight from when i heard about the story as it happened.. but wow that was a long time ago and i was young!<br>  <br>  but it did happen.. but as you realize...  it became a tradition so much now that no one believes it..  it's just something folks do  for halloween and the like.<br>  <br>  but you can hear crying at the creek... i'm sure it's the area.. the trees, structure of the bridge.. the way the water tumbles around the rocks and other things...  the creatures in the water..<br>  <br>  but it's legend now.<br>  <br>  from what once was human beings and a real news even.<br>  <br>  the town reeled over this for a long time..<br>  <br>  there's many more examples.. but this was the one i can recollect....<br>  <br>  (there was another.. but it's more complex... it happened in our highschool back in the 70s.. a janitor with alot of knowedge  using blackmail to get what he wanted..    haunting the ceilings, vents and the school in it's entirity...)   it ended up on  the national news as the "phantom of WHS"    now days...   it's just legend..  but it did happen.<br>  he was caught.. confessed and turned in a few names with pictures, documents.. the whole shpeal...  what a mess!<br>  <br>  but some say now it never happened.. and it's just a story.. but it did.

X1j7qYkUaa	I've got mates that switched teams, <br>  <br>  one couple which were roommates for over a decade and just sick of bs in dating games - which the m/f dating rituals can be pretty friggin' costly, both pretty geeky and out of shape guys, shot down most of the time when they approached chicks in public or answered ads, maybe my twisted influence of taking them to a bear event - where they were well received and even fawned over by a couple guys as prime grade meat - I have to think played into it some. But the primary events is a story old as time,  one that thought he was a little bi-curious and the other that had a nasty break-up with a girl he helped buy a car for ... got wasted, got stoned, decided to "go gay". They're running on about six years now.  And get a lot of gay tail for being "straight". <br>  <br>  Dudes which enjoyed receiving anal and figured they must be gay or at least bi, even when they weren't *attracted* to other men. <br>  <br>  Several straight "poz" guys which whether it was loneliness or horniness, found themselves on the opposite end of the spectrum. <br>  <br>  Dudes with a fixation or fetish for penis, which isn't exactly a full fledged admission to bisexuality, at least in my mind.  The same with the gay for pay scenarios or dudes that enjoy "gay sex", but really don't have a deeper connection to it beyond just getting off . <br>  <br>  And I believe it's fair to say that the majority of the "bi-curious" individuals isn't so much a question of sexuality, but rather a question or fantasy of what sex with someone of their own gender would be like... although sometimes it is.  <br>  <br>  then there's me which for all intensive purposes I'm bi, maybe I lean more to one side than the other when we're playing the duality game, but even so, there are choices in where I market my interests. <br>  <br>  While it doesn't change my attractions nor would I say my attractions are purely a choice ... there are choices which are made to how and where I market my interests. <br>  <br>  My opportunities viably can be presented as an open playing field - I don't believe it's so much of a predominate attraction to one above the other nor in general are my attractions purely physically based - the things which turn me on aren't necessarily overtly masculine or feminine, or isolated to features and attributes associated with being strictly male or female, or otherwise exclusive to anatomy.   <br>  <br>  But I suppose in a way, I also find myself developing a safety net or a realistically achievable plan if I'm looking for a casual fling, that likely involves a closer level of social compatibility, tolerance of what details I either present or reveal, as well as the frequency and sheer number of options in the pursuit of one rather than the other.  <br>  <br>  And that is a choice - which otherwise makes the suggestion of being labeled predominately "gay" as a product of my choices. <br>  <br>  However, my opinion on sexuality is not one of choice. <br>  <br>  Of course, I've limited this to an aspect of sex rather than taking the kissing jessica stein route... or the routes in which sexuality can also be defined.|`|evB63qWvaa	This argument can go both ways (no pun intended).  A person can't help what they like.  I mean, if you like something, you never really choose to like it, you just do.  But then again, others argue that you make the choice as soon as you sleep with the guy or something to that extent, because you can choose not to sleep with him and what not.

Kinsey reported that all of us have homosexual tendencies. On the sexual continuum, some people's tendencies lean way further to homosexuality and some are closer to the 100% heterosexual end.

I feel that a person is bi when they engage in sexual activity with the same sex. Therefore, I would have to say that my husband made the choice to be bi. He doesn't have any type of attraction or emotional connection with guys, he only enjoys having sex with guys. His first encounter with a guy didn't come about because of any type of outward or emotional feeling or longing. He was bored and when it was suggested to him, he was like okay. My first encounter with a girl went the same way. However, I have an actual attraction for women. I don't feel emotionally connected but I can look at a woman and desire her whereas my husband can't look at a man and desire him. So, with me, my attraction for women is not a choice. It is something that was there since I was about 6yrs old. My husband isn't the same way, so I feel that there are actually people out there who make a conscious choice to only deal with the same sex but there is an alternative- to not have sex at all. The same alternative applies in a hetero situation and a person can choose to have sex with the opposite sex or not.|`|G9R6VZOXaa	Yes me.

Since that time the ancient culture has been wiped out, and the Arab and Islamic Culture has replaced the native Egyptian culture. <br>  <br>  The Egyptian culture was to a large extent gone already, as Alexander the Great had Conquered Egypt about 900 years before. Following that Greek, and then Roman, and then Christian culture came into Egypt, so much, though not all, of Ancient Egyptian culture was gone by the time the Arabs came.<br>  <br>  The Ancient Egyptians were genetically Semitic so they were of the same genetic stock as the Arabs and the Jews. (Note, there was a brief time when Black Africans ruled Egypt, but this was long after the Pyramids, etc. had been built. A King of Nubia came north, and conquered Egypt and made himself Pharaoh. I don't recall his name, but it is rumored Will Smith is going to make a movie about the guy.) <br>  <br>  In any case, the current residents of Egypt are probably pretty close, genetically, to the Ancient Egyptians. Some, perhaps many,  are probably direct descendants. The Arabs were never the majority in Egypt, they just enforced laws that encouraged people to adopt their religion and culture, so over time the Egyptians adopted the customs and religion of their Arab rulers. <br>  <br>  In terms of language and culture though, Ancient and Modern Egypt  are very very different.|`|T1beLIQqaa	The Arab Semitic Whites have been in Egypt since about 5,000 B.C.. For about 1,000 broken up years out of this, they were ruled over by Turks, Romans, Iranians/Persians, Greeks-Indo European Aryan Whites, a small amount of Asiatic, and the Black Nubians-people of Kemit-Sudan(ruled Egypt from 800-700 B.C.).Egypt annexed part of Black Nubia in 1520 B.C.-present day Sudan, being the remainder).Egypt is, and, has been about 65% Arab Semitic White, 30 % Black Nubians,some Nilotics, admixture of Black Arab semitic White-Berbers, Hamites, Moors, and 5% all other ethnic groups.This is proven by skeletal measurements(mainly the skull) and DNA(haploid testing of the mummies).

e6brEEbOaa	As a Christian I whole heartily agree.  <br>  <br>  The vast majority of morality out there has nothing to do with the bible. <br>  <br>  For instance a woman has the right to choose to kill her baby.......not supported in the Bible.<br>  <br>  Or young heterosexual couple who decides to live together is no big deal...definitely not supported in the Bible.<br>  <br>  A CEO who take millions in bonuses while laying off thousands of workers....not supported in the Bible.<br>  <br>  A father abandoning his wife and children to marry a younger woman...not supported in the Bible.<br>  <br>  Politicians stealing money from taxpayers to subsidize farmers so that they do not farm any food....not from the bible.<br>  <br>  There are countless examples as you say.|`|0lnamekJaa	Exactly... <br>  <br>  The problem is that most Christians have not actually sat down and READ THE BIBLE from cover to cover... <br>  <br>  I understand... it is a tough read...

Came Not To Send Peace ? ? ? <br>  "Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own household." (Matthew 10:34-37)<br>  <br>  Comment<br>  These words of Jesus confirm the unbelievable notion that Jesus did not come to establish peace, but rather to send the sword and to put man against his family. So much for family values. (See also Luke 12: 51-53, Luke 12:49 and Luke 14:26.)<br>  <br>  ? ? ? I Come To Send Fire ? ? ? <br>  "I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?" (Luke 12:49)<br>  <br>  "Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division: For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law." (Luke 12:51-53)<br>  <br>  Comment<br>  Jesus did not come to send peace, but rather fire and division among the family. So much for the idea of a pacifist Jesus and the modern concept of "family values." (See also Luke 14:26)<br>  <br>  ? ? ? Jesus Not Entirely Good ? ? ? <br>  "And behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments." (Matthew 19:16-17)<br>  <br>  Comment<br>  Most Christians believe that Jesus, not only lived as the Son of God but God in the flesh. Consider that Jesus here calls "none good but one, that is, God," pointing to an entity separate from himself (also see Matt. 5:48)<br>  <br>  Also note that because of the belief that none other than God "is" good suggests that Jesus must not have behaved in an entirely good manner himself.<br>  <br>  Some early Gnostic cults (judged as heretics by the orthodox church) believed Jesus as the Devil in the flesh and these verses suggests that He was the opposite of good-- Evil in the disguise of God.<br>  <br>  ? ? ? Jesus' servants would fight ? ? ? <br>  "If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. " (John 18:36)<br>  <br>  Comment<br>  Jesus here gives Pilate an excuse for his predicament and, amazingly, makes the claim that his servants would fight for him if this world represented his kingdom. If Jesus' servants would fight for him, then what does that say about a peaceful world on earth or in heaven?<br>  <br>  In effect, Jesus here complains about his deliverance to the Jews which would lead to his crucifixion, something that God supposedly ordained for the purpose of salvation of sinners (according to believers). So much for that theory.<br>  <br>  ? ? ? Eat Your Children ? ? ?<br>  "And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD they God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straightness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee:" (Deuteronomy 28:53)<br>  <br>  "And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates." (Deuteronomy 28:57)<br>  <br>  Comment<br>  Here we have the horrific calling for cannibalism. It comes even more barbaric considering it calls for the devouring of their own sons and daughters.<br>  <br>  Hardly anyone today accepts cannibalism, yet many fundamentalist Christians would have us believe that cannibalism or some other depravity will result if we choose not to believe in God or to choose another god. (See also II Kings 6:28-29)<br>  <br>  ? ? ? Happy To Kill Children ? ? ?<br>  "Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones." (Psalms 137:9, KJV)<br>  <br>  "How blessed will be the one who seizes and dashes your little ones Against the rock." (Psalms 137:9, New American Bible)<br>  <br>  "Happy the man who shall seize and smash your little ones against the rock!" (Psalms 137:9, New American Bible)<br>  <br>  "a blessing on anyone who seizes your babies and shatters them against a rock!" (Psalms 137:9, Jerusalem Bible)<br>  <br>  Comment<br>  Ask a Christian friend whether he or she should feel happy to dash a child against the rocks. Your friend will most likely stare at you in horror, much less believe this idea exists in their sacred Bible.<br>  <br>  Many Churches have found this verse quite embarrassing. It gives no wonder why priests, Jews, and Christians alike, who quote from Psalms 137, always leave out this last verse. (See also Isaiah 13:16; Hosea 13-16)<br>  <br>  ? ? ?  Hate Them!  ? ? ?<br>  "Surely thou will slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men. For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain. Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies." (Psalms 139:19-22)<br>  <br>  Comment<br>  A message of hate from the, supposed, inspired words of God against anyone who takes God's name in vain or who goes against God.<br>  <br>  Faith in one's belief produces a barrier to further investigation. Religious groups that differ in beliefs from other societies cannot see past their own barriers. When hate enters into the prison of their beliefs, the seeds for violence to act out against other societies come to full bloom.<br>  <br>  ? ? ?  Hate Your Family! ? ? ?<br>  "If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple." (Luke 14:26)<br>  <br>  Comment<br>  This remarkable statement of hate by Jesus directly contradicts the idea of a loving Christ. If one must hate their father, mother, wife, children, brethren and sisters and even themselves, in order to become a disciple of Jesus, one must question Christ's idea love, family, and decency. (See also Luke 12:51-53, Matthew 10:34-37.)<br>  <br>  Note: A few desperate apologists attempt to dismiss this verse claiming that the word 'hate' here really doesn't mean what it says. The problem with this approach boarders on complete deception and the ironic dismissal of the Bible and Biblical scholarship. The word 'hate' here comes from the ancient Greek word 'miseo' which means hate (from the primary 'misos' [hatred]). If any synonym could substitute for this word, it would come from a word like 'detest,' 'loath,' or 'despise.' Moreover, virtually all Bibles translate the term as hate. To deny this intent means to deny the Bible and the alleged word of Jesus.<br>  <br>  ? ? ? Jesus Reveals Himself ? ? ? <br>  "I am the root and offspring of David, and the bright and morning star." (Revelation 22:16)<br>  <br>  Comment<br>  This verse presents the most shocking revelation in the entire Bible. On the very last page, it reveals Jesus as the "bright and morning star". In other words, Lucifer-- Satan!<br>  <br>  In Isaiah 14:12, St. Jerome, translated the Hebrew "morning star" into the Latin term "Lucifer" (light bearer), a name commonly ascribed to Satan by Christians, and represents the fallen star, an ancient symbol for the fallen or evil one. The mourning star actually appears as the planet Venus, the brightest "star" in the sky (but the ancients did not know about planets). Venus always appears low on the horizon, thus it looked like a fallen star (fallen angel) to the believers.<br>  <br>  Although the Isaiah verse describes the fallen king of Babylon, Christians have, for centuries, ascribed Satan as taking many forms. And what more powerful form could an evil being take than to pretend himself as the saviour of the world? This would certainly explain the hate filled verses attributed to Jesus and the blind followers who inherit ignorance. Thus, a conclusion, based on Christian beliefs of Satan, and the belief in the "inerrancy" of the Bible, one must conclude that Jesus has revealed himself as Satan!<br>  <br>  What a Revelation!<br>  <br>  ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ <br>  Penn & Teller: The Bible: Part 1 Of 3<br>  <a href="Http://Www.Youtube.Com/Watch?V=_Tgdqm9mo5s" rel="nofollow">Http://Www.Youtube.Com/Watch?V=_Tgdqm9mo...</a><br>  ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ <br>  Penn & Teller: The Bible: Part 2 Of 3<br>  <a href="Http://Www.Youtube.Com/Watch?V=1r1usmsyu3q" rel="nofollow">Http://Www.Youtube.Com/Watch?V=1r1usmsyu...</a><br>  ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ <br>  Penn & Teller: The Bible: Part 3 Of 3<br>  <a href="Http://Www.Youtube.Com/Watch?V=5rdjd3xtrza" rel="nofollow">Http://Www.Youtube.Com/Watch?V=5rdjd3xtr...</a><br>  ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ <br>  Penn & Teller: Signs From Heaven Part 1<br>  <a href="Http://Www.Youtube.Com/Watch?V=Jhh5qea5s54&Feature=Related" rel="nofollow">Http://Www.Youtube.Com/Watch?V=Jhh5qea5s...</a><br>  ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ <br>  Penn & Teller: Signs From Heav|`|AA11690436	Actually, at its heart, the Bible carries the same moral imperative that has been guiding humanity for at least six thousand years.

We are not blindly rigid in our beliefs or actions.<br>  <br>  Morals come from socio-culturing, parents, peers, and life experience.<br>  <br>  Many Christians claim that only those who believe can live a moral life and those who do not believe in god have no moral compass. That implies that one lives a moral life, not because it is the right thing to do, but because god expects us to be moral. Again, the fallacy with this reasoning is that mitzvahs and morals should be followed because god or a holy book dictates rules to us and not for personal philosophical or spiritual reasons.<br>  <br>  Whose morals are based upon a stronger footing?<br>  <br>  ATHEISTS - who have an intrinsic sense of positive and negative behaviors and actions, understanding that each situation is unique and calls for flexible rules and reasoning. Atheists possess an internal compass – call it a golden compass -- to help guide them toward positive and negative outcomes. Atheists possess great courage by taking a stand on something they comprehend, not some set of rules blindly followed.<br>  <br>  BELIEVERS - who would have no sense of morality in absence of god or bible. Believers whose only sense of morality comes from an external source yet possess no internal compass to guide them through life. Believers who have to constantly ask, "What would Jesus do" because they are completely devoid of internal sense making or judgment. Believers only have a book to point to for their beliefs.<br>  <br>  From responses I've seen in R&S, some Christians are jealous of us, believing we atheists are getting away with something. That we get to live a life without morals and then don't have to suffer the consequences. Not sure by what irrational logic they arrive at that conclusion. As an atheist I am moral, kind, and selfless because it is the right way to live. I have no expectation of any reward for proper living. Wouldn't a true Christian be good in absence of salvation, or are they only good to be saved?
z74a7wvlaa	JW believe Jesus is not God. Jesus as an angel is just another twist of the JW to convince  themselves they are OK. It is pointless to discuss the depth of the divinity of Jesus of the bible with JW as they believe in another Jesus, their discreet slaves - intermediary between their God and the JW people only. They wrote a corrupt bible and there's no way you could parallel your bible and NWT translation.

They got the answer for you!) <br>  <br>  Job 9:24 (NIV) When a land falls into the hands of the wicked* (*like the USA falling into the hands of Obama?), he* (*God) blindfolds its judges. If it is not he, then who is it*? (*Certainly not SATAN!)<br>  <br>  Lamentations 3:37-38 (infallible King James Version) Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not? OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE MOST HIGH PROCEEDETH NOT EVIL AND GOOD*? (*Preachers lie, they say that “God is GOOD”, but not firstly EVIL… read it again FIRST EVIL and then “good” as a teaser!)  <br>  <br>  Exodus 4:11 (NIV) The Lord said to him, “Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the Lord? (This Bible God loves to brag about his endeavors! How barbaric can you get? Only dedicated Christians know!)<br>  <br>  Amos 3:6 (infallible King James Version) Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be EVIL in a city, and the lord hath not done it?* (*ALL THE EVIL IN THE WORLD COMES FROM GOD… NOT FROM SATAN…!!! Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus is in control!!!)<br>  <br>  Proverbs 16:4 (NIV)  The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, EVEN THE WICKED FOR THE DAY OF EVIL* (*Hey, without customers Hell burns itself out!

I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The Lord has afflicted me; the Almighty* (*NOT SATAN, but God Almighty! PRAISE THE LORD…! Sweet Jesus!

God is also at the mercy of the weather conditions! You need to have a very low IQ and be very dishonest to qualify as a “minister of the Word of God”!), when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you. Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they* (*God’s people) will look for me but will not find me* (* yeah, what does God have to do with all that anyway? The Bible writers were not that smart!)<br>  <br>  There goes the “I’m with you to the end” or is it only a teaser joke? This God is real only in the clever mind of the Bible writers and the masochistically oriented Christians! <br>  <br>  Jeremiah 11: 14 "Do not pray for this people nor offer any plea or petition for them, BECAUSE I* (*God) WILL NOT LISTEN WHEN THEY CALL TO ME IN THE TIME OF THEIR DISTRESS.<br>  <br>  Nothing scares primitive religious people more than the idea that their God doesn’t listen to them! It still works today! The Christian idea that this whimsical God always listens to them is wishful hoping that the chances are just right for God to answer on the spot, or later on, or never! It is just like praying to a stick or a rock or any other more benevolent Heathen God and getting the SAME IDENTICAL RESULT!<br>  <br>  Romans 9:11-15  Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad–in order that God's purpose in election might stand: not by works but by him who calls–she was told, “The older will serve the younger.” Just as it is written: “Jacob* (*Israel) I loved, but Esau* (*Arabs) I hated.”  What then shall we say? IS GOD UNJUST? NOT AT ALL!* (*Saint Paul says so… because he is telling you he speaks for God!)  For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”* (*the Christian clergy preaches you all the opposite that God is “no respecter of persons” when the Bible writers made it clear that he very picky just for the heck of it! BTW, one of the reasons why Christians do not favor Palestinians at all unless they convert to Christianity is in this Bible story that is taught in Sunday School session not over the public media!  If the Palestinians convert to Christianity there is no guessing of what will happen. Christians favor for Israel will be put on hold! Except for Christians in America most Christians elsewhere don’t give a hoot about politics!) <br>  <br>   Malachi 1:4  (NIV) Edom* (*Esau… Arabs) may say, "Though we have been crushed, we will rebuild the ruins."  But this is what the LORD Almighty says: "They may build, but I will demolish. They will be called the Wicked Land, A PEOPLE ALWAYS UNDER THE WRATH OF THE LORD* (*How would you like to be one of them? No FREE WILL FOR YOU! NO Salvation, either! God doesn’t like you for ever just for the heck of it! AND GOD NEVER CHANGES!)<br>  <br>  Isaiah 45:7 (infallible King James Version) I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and CREATE EVIL: I the LORD* (*NOT SATAN, but God) do all these things.<br>  <br>  Job 42:11 (infallible King James Version) Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over ALL THE EVIL that the LORD* (*NOT SATAN, BUT GOD!) had brought upon him:* (*God had a plan to have ALL of Job’s children slaughtered! The heck with family love and affection…!!! Isn’t God so wonderful?! Life is so cheap in the Bible!)<br>  <br>  When was the last time that a Christian blamed God for any of his/her misfortune? They only credit Satan because that is what their favorite preachers tell them to do!  The only way that the Bible writers thought to pacify this whimsical sadistic God was sacrificing God the Son Jesus Christ after beating him up to a pulp to be properly tenderized and thoroughly marinated in Roman soldiers’ spit for a crucifixion number totally naked as a “spotless Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world!” There is no historical record that the Roman soldiers ever dressed any of their victim’s genital area in a white diaper before hanging them on any cross no matter how holy! In fact, there is no record that the Romans crucified anybody in Jerusalem outside of the Bible record. The Romans were known to IMPALE their victims driving a pole into their rectum and making them stand on it until after a few days later when the thick pole reached the heart or lung killing the victims by their body weight! Jesus hardly suffered a sissy’s death hanging from a nail holding him by his 2 hands. BTW, it is a SCIENTIFIC FACT that no human being can possibly be hanging any length of time by their own weight nailed to a “cross” by their hands while conducting a long conversation with his peers on the other crosses like Jesus did! Anybody with any measurable IQ can tell you that! This fact alone proves the deceitful mind of the Bible writers who invented Christianity! Spiritually speaking, of course! So how religiously primitive can you possibly get in our society today believing that the Roman soldiers would build a perfectly square and artistically looking cross for future generation of Christians to worship? Is there any thought given to the victim of any crucifixion to LOVE THE CROSS, rectum impaled pole or what have you the way Christians do? BTW, JWs are much closer to the truth about any Roman crucifixion bit. Based on historical records, they believe that Jesus was nailed to a pole instead of a cross! Nails were not manufactured that easily then to be used on common criminals. I know that Jesus was capable of pulling executive privilege, but there in no record in the Gospels that the Romans made an exception with him!  300 Years after the alleged crucifixion, Saint Helen found only 3 crosses in Jerusalem! This is a fact! Check the Early Church Father writings!<br>  <br>  Still Christians to this day delightfully snack this Jesus Christ spit flavored Meat and drink of his Holy Blood for “salvation” in the sacrament of the Holy Communion or Lord’s Supper so they can go to Heaven when they die (John 6:53). Europe is waking up out of the Dark Ages of Church domination and superstition far ahead of us here in America! I guess that religious gullibility will still be in effect until our IQ, common sense and self esteem improve to a decent level… Hey, are we still evolving or what?  The Bible writers were very silly to credit their idea of a God with so much EVIL when they could have done a much better job blaming the Devil all along…! They would have kept me fooled to this day, too!|`|AA11124121	in all examples..NT & OT alike,,Satan is <given> power to confront Creation.

He believed in the old adage " Spare the rod and spoil the child " It didn't take but three times in my raising to convince me. The first time was a learning experience and the last two times were refresher courses. It sure did work too and worked well.

In psychiatry, the definition is necessarily more precise and implies that the belief is pathological (the result of an illness or illness process). As a pathology it is distinct from a belief based on false or incomplete information or certain effects of perception which would more properly be termed an apperception or illusion.<br>  <br>  Delusions typically occur in the context of neurological or mental illness, although they are not tied to any particular disease and have been found to occur in the context of many pathological states (both physical and mental). However, they are of particular diagnostic importance in psychotic disorders and particularly in schizophrenia and mania in episodes of bipolar disorder.|`|T8v39Aw9aa	Christianity - and other religions, for that matter - offer the reassurance that this life is not the only one we have, and that we will be reunited with our loved ones when we pass away.  It also gives people someone (the deity, whichever it is) to turn to for support in times of need.  Believing that It is listening when you talk is a comforting thought.<br>  <br>  Atheism offers none of these reassurances - it conjures instead the existential dilemma and forces one to face the facts that they are going to die eventually, that there's nothing waiting for them when they do, and that they are alone in their decisions.  This is pretty hard stuff to face - that's the whole idea of angst and existential courage.<br>  <br>  ADDITION: Haha, I love it when people give thumbs up/down based upon whether or not the answer agrees with their personal beliefs rather than whether or not the answer is sound.  While my response might seem to be supporting organized religion, I'm simply answering the question!  I'm actually agnostic.

Even today, not all Africans are black - there are lots of people of European descent living there.  Questions of race are just that, questions of race.  If it were asking your continent of origin, you'd have to say North American.  If the form were asking from what continent you ultimately descended, only then would you be correct to put African.

uK3tkaOJaa	Oh god yes.  Thing is, as a mommy, I get very very defensive about that question when it comes to my kids.  They hear the question too and it bothers them.<br>  <br>  I have Rock Star kids in the morals department.  A teacher told my daughter that she modelled "compassion" for her classmates.  They volunteer hundreds of hours a year.  The other daughter belongs to clubs that help children in Africa and she's the President of the Students Against Destructive Decisions chapter at her High School.  They are the most loving and kind people in the world and they've been inside a church once.  And yet, upon finding out about our Atheism, their classmates have asked them things like "Does your family love each other?"  It's terribly offensive and they just don't understand it.<br>  <br>  Thanks for the link.

But it says in some narrations: “The end of the world will not occur so long there remain on the earth those who say, Allah! Allah!” So how after most people have come to believe, will most people become unbelievers?<br>  <br>  <br>  T h e A n s w e r : Those whose belief is weak deem it unlikely that what is narrated in a sound Hadith, “Jesus (Upon whom be peace) will come, he will act in accordance with the Shari’a of Islam, and he will kill the Dajjal,” will come about. But if the reality of this is explained, no reason remains to deem it unlikely. it is as follows:<br>  <br>  The meaning expressed by this Hadith and those about the Sufyan and the Mehdi, is this: at the end of time two currents of irreligion will gain strength.<br>  <br>  One of them: Under the veil of duplicity, a fearsome individual named the Sufyan, who will deny the prophethood of Muhammed (PBUH), will come to lead the dissemblers, and will try to destroy the Islamic Shari’a. To oppose him, a luminous individual called Muhammed Mehdi of the Family of the Prophet will come to lead the people of sainthood and perfection, who are bound to the luminous chain of the Family of the Prophet, and he will kill the current of dissemblers, which will be the collective personality of the Sufyan, and scatter it.<br>  <br>  The Second Current: A tyrannical current born of Naturalist and Materialist philosophy will gradually become strong and spread at the end of time by means of materialist philosophy, reaching such a degree that it denies God. A savage who does not recognize the king or accept that the officers and soldiers in the army are his soldiers ascribes a sort of kingship and rulership to everyone and to all the soldiers. In just the same way, the members of that current, who deny God, each ascribes dominicality to his soul like a little Nimrod. And the greatest of them, the Dajjal, who will come to lead them, will manifest awesome wonders - a sort of spiritualism and hypnosis; he will go even further, and imagining his tyrannical, superficial rule to be a sort of dominicality, he will proclaim his godhead. It is clear just what foolish buffoonery it is for impotent man, who may be defeated by a fly and cannot create even a fly’s wing, to claim godhead.<br>  <br>  At that point when the current appears to be very strong, the religion of true Christianity, which comprises the collective personality of Jesus (Upon whom be peace), will emerge. That is, it will descend from the skies of Divine Mercy. Present Christianity will be purified in the face of that reality; it will cast off superstition and distortion, and unite with the truths of Islam. Christianity will in effect be transformed into a sort of Islam. Following the Qur’an, the collective personality of Christianity will be in the rank of follower, and Islam, In that of leader. True religion will become a mighty force as a result of its joining it. Although defeated before the atheistic current while separate, Christianity and Islam will have the capability to defeat and rout it as a result of their union. Then the person of Jesus (Upon whom be peace), who is present with his human body in the world of the heavens, will come to lead the current of true religion, as, relying on the promise of One Powerful Over All Things, the Bringer of Sure News has said. Since he has told of it, it is true, and since the One Powerful Over All Things has promised it, He will certainly bring it about.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2946&t=The+Fifteenth+Letter" rel="nofollow">http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2946&...</a>|`|LZJPMl8raa	You would know by all his glory.|`|t88527U1aa	All believers would be gone!|`|OtKCAeQZaa	For he shell descend in a cloud ,and ye shell see and hear his voice and it shell pierce your heart.

Love someone else, but don't love yourself. <br>  <br>  If you can't love yourself, then you can't love anyone else. If you can choose between your life and someone you profess to love, then your love isn't unconditional.  It is conditional: you love on the condition that it is THAT person as opposed to yourself. True love doesn't make such distinctions. <br>  <br>  "I am in love" is an emotion; it is infatuation.  It is not love. <br>  <br>  True love does not try to posess, control, or change another person.  It accepts that person just as they are.  It lets go of that person if letting go is in the best interests of that person.  It lets go of that person if happiness is to be found elsewhere.

Go back even 250-300 years. Marriage WAS all about Social status and wealth!!!! Marriage, for the most part in most past cultures, wasn't about love at all. As a woman, your family married you off to the richest guy they could! And you had NO say! <br>  <br>  2. Divorce was either extremely hard to do, or virtually impossible! Why do you think the Henry the VIII, started the church of England? The Catholic church wouldn't allow him to get divorced! So he started his own church, in order to get one! And she was lucky. He killed several wives to get rid of them!<br>  <br>  3. There used to be a social stigma associated with it. To get divorced was a scandal, and you often had to prove infidelity or other issues just to get divorce.<br>  <br>  4. Life-span, and just trying eek by!<br>  <br>   Let's face it. When you get hitched at 12, have lots of hard labor to perform, squeeze out half-a-dozen kids or more, and die at 45-50, you don't have much time to think about whether or not your happy. Your just trying to survive. Love doesn't really enter into that situation either. You just get hitched to the available guy in the village, and get on with things.<br>  <br>  I find it even funnier, that the divorce rate is highest among Christians. I guess pushing that whole "wait till your married" thing, almost forces teenagers and very young 20-somethings, to make rash decisions because they really only want to get laid, but have to do it "the right way". I've seen it happen. <br>  <br>  I also know, that many get married young because they DO think they are in love. But as they get older and change, as most people do from high school to their mid 20's, they realize that they don't love that other person as much as they thought. Or realize, that they never really loved them like they should have to get married. They just wanted to "do the right thing".<br>  <br>  So wake up and join reality. It's only been in the last few 100 years or so, that marriage has truly been based on love, and that YOU and I get to choose who that person is!|`|psLk5fDGaa	It isn't the people, it's our culture.

Things that for whatever reason, we tend to place on the back burner. <br>  <br>  Most people tend to forget that the divorce rate has sky rocketed only after divorce became socially acceptable. I feel that many of our grandparent's and ancestors were unhappily married but stayed together for the stability and because it was frowned upon not too. <br>  <br>  Also, people forget that in most other countries love has very little to do with marriage.

Single mothers are now rewarded for their indescretions, in the form of welfare hand-outs, draconian child-support requirements made on the father (whoever he is...a lot of times, the women don't even know for sure...), and other services..., and can even have their unborn son or daughter legally murdered, in cold blood, simply on their whim (legal abortion), all payed for by the ones of us who DO exercise some responsibility.<br>  <br>  If I had my way, both adultry, and becoming pregnant out of wedlock would be punishable offenses. They cost the rest of us easily as much as crime does monetarily, emotionaly, and spiritually. They are a drain on public funds, and blight on moral society. And, yes, men do bear a small part of the responsibility, however, men do not get pregnant. Women do, and they know this. It is a woman's responsibility to say 'No', and to take steps to avoid pregnancy, because she has the most to risk.<br>  <br>  Of course that will never happen, because in today's world, nobody has to be responsible, and everybody is a victim.....everyone except honest taxpayers......|`|eK5QBP6gaa	they try to  act like an adult but really ther silly little kids they like to stand out but they just got no sense atall they dont look like adults to adults they dont inmpress them so y do it|`|dMXdjv3Xaa	I'm guessing they enjoyed the act and didn't expect a baby.|`|L2fN1ZUVaa	Gawhd!<br>  I noe wut the **** is wrong wif ppl these days..<br>  I feel sorry for em !!|`|kafpYPC1aa	I think it's poor sex education & many kids seem to grow up fast.

tzkxtKgeaa	1: It gives you something to talk about.  Sports make life more interesting and give you something to think about.  You get to see players, go to their games, and meet with other fans due to where you live. <br>  2: Borders do exist in a (psycho)logical sense.  Example:  Chinese control of the media.  There are many other secluded countries that do the same.  This means they are completely closed off to much of modern thought.  This also heavily ties into national religions.<br>  3: Saying you hate a country means you hate what they stand for.  It's usually an ignorant though, but often times the stereotypes these thoughts are based on are very true (Ex. American consumerism).  Most of the time they really just hate that person's government, so they can also blame the people who voted the leader in assuming they are democratic.  <br>  4. Where you're from throws some soft walls up for where you are going to go in life.  In Africa it's much more difficult to get ahead in life because the don't have the money to move or  the education to get the job.  <br>  <br>  People can say it's better to live where they are because due to their circumstances, it does not get any better.

H8WqMK1eaa	Excellent question.<br>  <br>  I have been exposed to countless religions and belief systems...including atheists...<br>  <br>  I have had atheists try to "de-convert" me out of theism...using very interesting tactics--attempting to appeal to my sense of logic & reason...as well as fear that I am actually being delusional.<br>  <br>  In fact, I did not make a choice to believe in God any more than I made a choice to be a heterosexual.|`|AA10721549	you can be born atheist. you cannot be born reliigous<br>  <br>  quote> It's the same argument of people "being born into their religion"< fail.<br>  <br>  you are inevitably born into atheism, the rest is indoctrination mixed with superstitions. because atheism is no religion , "being born into atheism"=/= "being born into their religion" just turned around|`|yH4N9D0Xaa	Actually, I think Agnosticism is the default.  Atheism requires you to take a position on the subject, so you can't be born an Atheist.  It IS a choice to take that stance.  I know of some people who think logically and can be reasoned with, who don't take stock in their religion, but follow it anyway, out of habit or fear.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	I am an Agnostic.  I have made an examination of various religions and philosophies in my life, and have chosen to be labeled an Agnostic as that best fits my world view.  I possibly may not have much choice about my perspective on the world, but I certainly have a choice as to how I will label myself to others.  <br>  <br>  The reason I picked Agnostic is that is seems the most open minded way to consider the possibilities.  I am implicitly accepting no other point of view, and implicitly rejecting no other point of view.  However, I do at times explicitly reject some behaviors I find disagreeable based on my personal point of view.  <br>  <br>  In my perspective I find some Atheists and some Theists both to be a bit overly wound up about their beliefs.  Both sides spend too much time and effort repudiating the other side in my estimation.  The funny thing is that both sides have a tendency to drag out the same old arguments that didn't work to convince the opposite side the last time they were used.   <br>  <br>  Personally, I have disagreed with the behavior exhibited by individuals on both sides of that debate many times.  When courtesy and tolerance are replaced by name calling and bickering, then I will step in and chastise everyone involved at times.  I get my negative thumbs, and redirect their animosity perhaps by doing so, but I remain civil none the less.<br>  <br>  To answer your question: Yes, I think that some people are raised into Atheism just as they are raised into Theism.  I also think that some people choose both sides as well after consideration and contemplation on the matter.  I also tend to think that the people who make a deliberate thought out choice have a more solid claim to their belief, than the people who are just following along with how they were brought up.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	The popularity of an idea does not necessarily mean it is "forced" onto anyone.  Although there are certain to be people out there who instill their children with the belief that no god exists, I think they are the exception more than the rule.  The people that are "born into their religion" generally attend church with their parents on a regular basis and are directly told that there is a God that must be worshipped and obeyed.  In my experience, atheists don't attend any atheistic gatherings, and usually allow their children to investigate religion and churches for themselves to make up their own minds.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	I've never once said that atheism is a choice.<br>  <br>  As to religion, it's a matter of CONDITIONING, not birth.<br>  <br>  If you had identical twins, separated them at birth, and had one raised with atheists and the other with Christians, it's a sure bet that they'll grow up with the same belief system as their parents.|`|0c44db9bf3337a894a67a66af6d2192baa	This is a good question.  I don't know if belief (as in religion) is a choice.  I think it is a construct.  All of a persons small beliefs (as in small bits of knowledge) are put together to form a larger belief system.<br>  <br>  That's why, I think, there are so many different types of religion.  And even those that are not religious can be "spiritual".  There are as many types of Christianity as there are Christians.|`|p8nDiI3Vaa	In life we are all given the ability to choose. This is because choosing comes from God. Many would like to refer to it as free will. Through the many signicant creations that man has created, he still cannot find God(rockets + airplanes + space probes). It would not be logical to say that God does not exist because think about it. The computer you type on where did it come from? The shoes you wear, where did it come from? The gel you put in your hair, where did that come from? Certainly not God, but perhaps man created it, right? My point is for everything that is, there is always a creator behind it. So it would only be logical that for something as sophisticated as this creation of us human beings, there must've been somebody to create us as well. Just as a computer turns on it has it's life(ability to work). Just as a human breaths the first breath of life and opens their eyes we have the ability to work or to experience life way beyond the complications of what the computer has to offer. Human beings are the most significant creation that God has ever created, bar-none. I understand your argument but behind everything in this world there is a creator and nothing just sprang up. The earth didnt create itself and then then give humans the same ability. Something more livelier and immaculate did this. Think about it my friend! Think about it!|`|z4Yeofq8aa	I just realised that atheism was the logical default due to a lack of evidence for God.

It is just like praying to a stick or a rock or any other more benevolent Heathen God and getting the SAME IDENTICAL RESULT!<br>  <br>  Romans 9:11-15  Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad–in order that God's purpose in election might stand: not by works but by him who calls–she was told, “The older will serve the younger.” Just as it is written: “Jacob* (*Israel) I loved, but Esau* (*Arabs) I hated.”  What then shall we say? IS GOD UNJUST? NOT AT ALL!* (*Saint Paul says so… because he is telling you he speaks for God!)  For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”* (*the Christian clergy preaches you all the opposite that God is “no respecter of persons” when the Bible writers made it clear that he very picky just for the heck of it! BTW, one of the reasons why Christians do not favor Palestinians at all unless they convert to Christianity is in this Bible story that is taught in Sunday School session not over the public media!  If the Palestinians convert to Christianity there is no guessing of what will happen. Christians favor for Israel will be put on hold! Except for Christians in America most Christians elsewhere don’t give a hoot about politics!) <br>  <br>   Malachi 1:4  (NIV) Edom* (*Esau… Arabs) may say, "Though we have been crushed, we will rebuild the ruins."  But this is what the LORD Almighty says: "They may build, but I will demolish. They will be called the Wicked Land, A PEOPLE ALWAYS UNDER THE WRATH OF THE LORD* (*How would you like to be one of them? No FREE WILL FOR YOU! NO Salvation, either! God doesn’t like you for ever just for the heck of it! AND GOD NEVER CHANGES!)<br>  <br>  Isaiah 45:7 (infallible King James Version) I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and CREATE EVIL: I the LORD* (*NOT SATAN, but God) do all these things.<br>  <br>  Job 42:11 (infallible King James Version) Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over ALL THE EVIL that the LORD* (*NOT SATAN, BUT GOD!) had brought upon him:* (*God had a plan to have ALL of Job’s children slaughtered! The heck with family love and affection…!!! Isn’t God so wonderful?! Life is so cheap in the Bible!)<br>  <br>  When was the last time that a Christian blamed God for any of his/her misfortune? They only credit Satan because that is what their favorite preachers tell them to do!  The only way that the Bible writers thought to pacify this whimsical sadistic God was sacrificing God the Son Jesus Christ after beating him up to a pulp to be properly tenderized and thoroughly marinated in Roman soldiers’ spit for a crucifixion number totally naked as a “spotless Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world!” There is no historical record that the Roman soldiers ever dressed any of their victim’s genital area in a white diaper before hanging them on any cross no matter how holy! In fact, there is no record that the Romans crucified anybody in Jerusalem outside of the Bible record. The Romans were known to IMPALE their victims driving a pole into their rectum and making them stand on it until after a few days later when the thick pole reached the heart or lung killing the victims by their body weight! Jesus hardly suffered a sissy’s death hanging from a nail holding him by his 2 hands. BTW, it is a SCIENTIFIC FACT that no human being can possibly be hanging any length of time by their own weight nailed to a “cross” by their hands while conducting a long conversation with his peers on the other crosses like Jesus did! Anybody with any measurable IQ can tell you that! This fact alone proves the deceitful mind of the Bible writers who invented Christianity! Spiritually speaking, of course! So how religiously primitive can you possibly get in our society today believing that the Roman soldiers would build a perfectly square and artistically looking cross for future generation of Christians to worship? Is there any thought given to the victim of any crucifixion to LOVE THE CROSS, rectum impaled pole or what have you the way Christians do? BTW, JWs are much closer to the truth about any Roman crucifixion bit. Based on historical records, they believe that Jesus was nailed to a pole instead of a cross! Nails were not manufactured that easily then to be used on common criminals. I know that Jesus was capable of pulling executive privilege, but there in no record in the Gospels that the Romans made an exception with him!  300 Years after the alleged crucifixion, Saint Helen found only 3 crosses in Jerusalem! This is a fact! Check the Early Church Father writings!<br>  <br>  Still Christians to this day delightfully snack this Jesus Christ spit flavored Meat and drink of his Holy Blood for “salvation” in the sacrament of the Holy Communion or Lord’s Supper so they can go to Heaven when they die (John 6:53). Europe is waking up out of the Dark Ages of Church domination and superstition far ahead of us here in America! I guess that religious gullibility will still be in effect until our IQ, common sense and self esteem improve to a decent level… Hey, are we still evolving or what?  The Bible writers were very silly to credit their idea of a God with so much EVIL when they could have done a much better job blaming the Devil all along…! They would have kept me fooled to this day, too!|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Beats me!!<br>  <br>  Just try reading a small sample of Christian postings on here!!!<br>  <br>  Intolerant, egotistical, hate filled and bigoted!!

He wasn't the only god; he was the god of the Jews.  He did things like wrestle with Jacob, talk to Moses on a mountain top, and tell his followers to smite the _____ (fill in the name of your favorite OT bad guys, here.)  This guy was ancient; he'd had his origin in a number of other religions and societies.  He was just the kind of god the early Israelites could get behind.<br>  <br>  But, the Jews, being an intelligent and imaginative people who liked to keep current (just like we do, today) picked up new ideas about God over the next 1000-1500 years; adopting ideas from the Persians, the Greeks, the Egyptians, and so on, until, by the time of Jesus, they had many sects teaching very different philosophies; some that taught of miracles and introduced intermediaries for God (angels, prophets, etc.)  There were many men in that day who would go from town to town preaching their beliefs and "performing miracles."<br>  <br>  Into this new age world came Jesus, another one of these men, who taught this freaky new lovey-touchy-feely stuff.  He got some followers who dug his act; but he also pissed off the fundamentalists of his day.  In the end, the fundies had him put to death and so he became a symbol for his followers, who really were into his whole "loving God" concept.|`|LjsRfaskaa	When murderers are questioned they do not perceive themselves as being evil.

It helps provide meaning to experience and understanding to knowledge; it is a fundamental facility through which people make sense of the world,[1][2][3] and it also plays a key role in the learning process.[1][4] A basic training for imagination is the listening to storytelling (narrative),[1][5] in which the exactness of the chosen words is the fundamental factor to 'evoke worlds'.[6]<br>  <br>  Imagination is the faculty through which we encounter everything. The things that we touch, see and hear coalesce into a "picture" via our imagination.<br>  <br>  It is accepted as the innate ability and process to invent partial or complete personal realms within the mind from elements derived from sense perceptions of the shared world.[citation needed] The term is technically used in psychology for the process of reviving in the mind, percepts of objects formerly given in sense perception. Since this use of the term conflicts with that of ordinary language, some psychologists have preferred to describe this process as "imaging" or "imagery" or to speak of it as "reproductive" as opposed to "productive" or "constructive" imagination. Imagined images are seen with the "mind's eye".<br>  <br>  Imagination can also be expressed through stories such as fairy tales or fantasies. Most famous inventions or entertainment products were created from the inspiration of one's imagination.<br>  <br>  One hypothesis for the evolution of human imagination is that it allowed conscious beings to solve problems (and hence increase an individual's fitness) by use of mental simulation.|`|AA12193600	It was realized in the heavenly office of Human and Deity Relations, that some spin control needed to be utilized for some of the bosses programs.

I suggest you sit down with your parents tell them that their questioning of your sexual preferences bothers you and try and explain what you're really feeling, otherwise I'm afraid it could come to worse blows later on if their ideas keep building and you say nothing.

Please read it with your bible!<br>  <br>  ‘O?Jehovah, Put Me to the Test’<br>  “JEHOVAH is the examiner of hearts.” (Proverbs 17:3) That should be extremely reassuring for all of us. Why? Because unlike humans, who judge merely by what appears to the eyes, our heavenly Father “sees what the heart is.”—1?Samuel 16:7.<br>  Actually, even we ourselves are not the best evaluators of our own deepest motives and innermost inclinations. Why? Because our “heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate. Who can know it?” Well, God knows it, for he declares: “I, Jehovah, am searching the heart, examining the kidneys.” (Jeremiah 17:9,?10) Yes, Jehovah understands “the heart”—including our inner motivations—as well as “the kidneys,” our deepest thoughts and emotions.<br>  Why Tested?<br>  It is little wonder, then, that King David of old said to God: “Examine me, O?Jehovah, and put me to the test; refine my kidneys and my heart.” (Psalm 26:2) Was David completely clean in action and in speech, so that he had nothing to fear if Jehovah put him to the test? Of course not! David, like all of us, was imperfect and unable to measure up perfectly to God’s standards. Because of his weaknesses, David committed several serious wrongs, but he nevertheless ‘walked with integrity of heart.’ (1?Kings 9:4) How? By accepting reproof and correcting his way. He thereby showed that he genuinely loved Jehovah. His devotion to God was complete.<br>  What about us today? Jehovah knows that we are imperfect and that we may sin in speech and deed. He does not, however, determine our course of life by using his ability to foreknow our future. He has created us as free moral agents, and he respects our free will—a gift that he has graciously given us.<br>  Still, at times Jehovah does in a sense test our inner person, including our motives. He may do this by allowing us opportunities to reveal our heart condition. He may also allow various circumstances or challenges to reveal our innermost inclinations. This gives us the opportunity to show Jehovah how devoted and loyal we are. Such tests allowed by Jehovah may prove the quality of our faith, whether we are “complete and sound in all respects, not lacking in anything.”—James 1:2-4.<br>  An Ancient Test of Faith<br>  Tests of faith and motives are not new for Jehovah’s servants. Consider the patriarch Abraham. “The true God put Abraham to the test.” (Genesis 22:1) When those words were spoken, Abraham’s faith in God had already been tested. Decades before, Jehovah had asked Abraham to move with his family from the flourishing city of Ur to an unknown land. (Genesis 11:31; Acts 7:2-4) Abraham, who may have been a homeowner in Ur, did not purchase any permanent residence in Canaan, where he lived for decades. (Hebrews 11:9) Abraham’s status as a nomad put him and his family in some danger from famine, armed bands, and pagan rulers of the area. Through all of this, Abraham’s faith proved to be of the highest quality.<br>  Then Jehovah put Abraham to a greater test. “Take, please, your son, your only son whom you so love, Isaac, and .?.?. offer him up as a burnt offering.” (Genesis 22:2) For Abraham, Isaac was not just any son. He was the only child of Abraham and his wife, Sarah. Isaac was the son of the promise, Abraham’s only hope that his “seed” would inherit the land of Canaan and be a blessing to many, according to God’s promise. After all, Isaac was the son whom Abraham was expected to have and who was born after a miracle from God!—Genesis 15:2-4,?7.<br>  You can imagine how hard it must have been for Abraham to understand this command. Would Jehovah require a human sacrifice? Why would Jehovah let Abraham taste the sweet joy of having a son at the sunset of his life, only to ask him to sacrifice this same son?<br>  Without having clear answers to these questions, Abraham promptly obeyed. It took him three days to reach the selected mountain. There he built an altar and placed firewood on top. Now came the climax of the test. Abraham took hold of the slaughtering knife, but as he was about to kill his son, Jehovah through an angel stopped him and said: “Now I do know that you are God-fearing in that you have not withheld your son, your only one, from me.” (Genesis 22:3, 11,?12) Think how richly Abraham was rewarded by hearing that! Jehovah’s prior estimation of his faith was correct. (Genesis 15:5,?6) Thereupon, Abraham sacrificed a ram that replaced Isaac. Then Jehovah confirmed the covenant promises about Abraham’s seed. Understandably, Abraham became known as Jehovah’s friend.—Genesis 22:13-18; James 2:21-23.<br>  Our Faith Is Also Tested<br>  We all realize that God’s servants today cannot escape tests. In our case, however, the test may be more in what Jehovah allows to happen than in what he tells us to do.<br>  The apostle Paul wrote: “All those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted.” (2?Timothy 3:12) Such persecution may come from schoo|`|qBOPQQQpaa	God gave men free will and in that circumstance, he cannot predict what you will decide to do in all things.....if he can, he didn't give you free will and the teachings of a reliable just God are false.........|`|t88527U1aa	We live in the world the test of faith is living here and still exalt the living God!|`|AA11297267	Good question.<br>  Awful answers (for the most part!).<br>  <br>  Not a single christian admitted that it's a conundrum...that there shouldn't be any reason to "test" you, since god supposedly already knows what's in your heart and what you will do.

QnH9QuQwaa	Often Atheists on here say that they read the Bible more often and know it better than Christians.  Every time I disagree I get tons of thumbs down.<br>  <br>  So why not quote scripture?  They claim to already know so much about it, so they should understand and recognize it.<br>  <br>  Once I got 18 thumbs down for saying that it's not true.  Now you're telling me that I was correct.  Atheists don't have a Bible and quoting it is like quoting a foreign language.  Good.  I will cut and paste this question next time.|`|yPy4gFZ9aa	cause thats the way they think.... the bible substitutes their brain...|`|AA11690436	Well, I think it's only fair that we put up with a little verse spouting, if we're going answer their questions with blanket denials, "There's no heaven, no hell, and Jesus didn't even exist, much less as a Son of God."<br>  <br>  It's all part of the R&S party. <br>  <br>  Tell you what.  Every time someone mentions John 3:15, or ANY chapter and verse from Revelation, take a shot (I do vodka).|`|Kz7BsZk6aa	That's all they have to fall back on to support their beliefs.

I do, rarely, post links to an online Bible for reference  if someone should want to look it up for them self... for the most part I have found it a total waste of time to quote the Bible on YA... to any one... there is almost no honest interest in any of The Truth of God here...<br>  <br>  If you do get a quote with the Chapt and Verse given you can look it up to read the related verses at:  <a href="http://www.htmlbible.com/kjv30" rel="nofollow">http://www.htmlbible.com/kjv30</a>|`|s7pqFa1eaa	They are incapable of independent thought, they refer to their guide book for every argument.<br>  <br>  You are right, there is truth and wisdom to be found in any book, the bible has no lock on that.|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	It's annoying, and I have to scroll down more!

I call it Irrationalism.|`|xLKPKgZXaa	Because this is 'Religion' and Spirituality and Christians use the bible as part of their religion. Also, the majority of atheists who use this site claim to know their bibles very well indeed and delight in trying to prove us wrong by quoting bible verses themselves.<br>  <br>  If the atheistic questions to which you refer have nothing to do with any religion (and you claim that atheism is not a religion) then these questions must be being posted on R & S by mistake when they were actually intended for another section of Y.A.<br>  <br>  Perhaps a more careful choice of section is required for atheistic questions in future and then we won't upset you.|`|641c55ed860a473abbc5c57c2b35186aaa	What they don't realize or seem to care about is that they are writing scripture to people who don't believe in the bible...so it is going to go in one ear and out the other, if they even read it at all. No one likes to be PREACHED to especially if they are an unbeliever.  I think it is best to just share your view in your own terms and let them decipher how they will.  A person really needs to be filled with the spirit to understand the scripture, otherwise is can scare the begebies out of you.<br>  <br>  I, more often than not, quote scripture to those who claim to be believers.|`|CB9a6q9Waa	Because that's what it's for, hence why each paragraph is numbered, makes it easier to skip other paragraphs of the same story so they can use a specific one to lay down an argument with it when most of the time the paragraph in that chapter has nothing to do with the question. Who am I to say that the clown from Stephen King's "IT" that eats children isn't real or was real if all I have to do to prove it is quote the novel?|`|hdFn4Dobaa	We quote to tell you and all who have ears to hear, where to go find it, so that you know that it came from the Word of God, not ourselves.<br>   <br>  Also, for the ones too lazy to look it up for themselves, or do not possess a Bible, or do not know how to read the Bible,  we help them out. We teach, because we love you....may not like what you are doing, but we still love all humanity.<br>  <br>  When sin separates a person from God, and the Bible declares that it does, that individual cannot receive Spiritual truth. The natural man does not receive the things of God, for their foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are Spiritually discerned.<br>  <br>  The man who is not a Christian can't understand and can't accept these thoughts of God, which the Holy Spirit teaches us. They sound foolish to him because only those who have the Holy Spirit within them can understand what the Holy Spirit means. Others cannot take it in. <br>  <br>  To the non-spiritually reborn person, the voice of God is just too much noise. He or she may be able to learn law and principles from another person, but the Spirit of God lacks a channel through which to communicate to the unregenerate individual.<br>  <br>  Our main goal is to help others to find Salvation ( a free Gift of the Lord ) , but we cannot make you recieve the Word of God and grow from it, or even to feel the love of the Lord. We nurture the seed of faith that God has implanted into all of us dear. <br>  This seed of faith is a remarkable thing---------and the ground in which it falls upon has to be watered, tilled, weeded, and nourished or fed with supplements, so that it may fall on good ground and reap a harvest of good fruit.This good fruit can only come forth when the ground is fertile.<br>  <br>  Christians have experienced God, and come to the realization that there is nothing greater than the Knowledge of the Lord. We love humanity, and do not desire the destiny of non-believers to be the same as that of  of Satan and his followers. We are instructed by the Lord to be a fisherman of men ( humanity ). We are still family, and Judgement Day is very near, God loves His Creation dearly and give us Grace. From His Grace, we have Salvation  through Jesus the Christ.|`|K3Ndzuabaa	"When the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."

Everyone else just sees it as a book written a long time ago, and usually as just a fictional story book based on historical events that was written a long time ago. The bible is only effective ammunition against people who believe it. Against atheists and other religions, its about as good as me trying to use Mort by Terry Pratchett to explain to people that the Grim Reaper is real.|`|l6Jew1qAaa	I can't speak for all Christians, only myself. I don't quote chapter and verse to non-believers, or even to other Christians...because it would be pointless--atheists don't want to hear it and Christians already know [or they should]. I do paraphrase from the Bible, because my religious beliefs are based on the teachings of Jesus, and the only place I can obtain those teachings is from the Bible. If I answer atheistic questions, if they pertain to religion or values, then I answer based on my belief and values systems, past experiences, and any knowledge that I may have that would enable me to answer the question. If part of the answer comes from the Bible, I don't always say so...I just use faith based knowledge to answer.

Good and Evil do not exist because of knowledge of god.  If you believe in a creator being that created everything, and if you believe that nothing other than this creator existed before the first act of creation.  Than would in not stand to reason that good and evil either solely exist because god created them, or because they were part of this god to begin with.  <br>  <br>  Also I am 36, I am well educated and successful, I have read your bible many times, and I am positive that you have never ever read yours from cover to cover.|`|pqveENjUaa	Everyone has their own set choice of morals.

They know for some reason that killing a person is bad. They know stealing is bad. Without knowing it, they are following god's word of not doing such things.<br>  <br>  Besides, there is more to just knowing good and evil. Heck, the devil knows what he is doing. Many times, when he tempted Jesus, he used the scriptures. It comes to show, that it doesn't matter how much you know about the scriptures if you act like a devil yourself.<br>  <br>  Anyways...Many atheists don't believe in god when they do believe in the divine rules such as gravity and other physics laws. They can't explain it but they sure do believe in them. They know wind exists by the feeling we have. Scientist know black holes exist. Can they prove it? No. But they know it does by its surrounding objects. They know that plants use photosynthesis. Can they explain it? No, but they believe in them. What about the scientific method? In honest terms, isn't it a method of figuring out the hypothesis using predefined terms and laws that we see around us? I don't get why atheist believe in many things they can't explain or see, but refuse to believe in god when they clearly see his creation around us, including ourselves.|`|crVFU6lBaa	If that were infact true, then all atheists would kill people - and no killers would be Christian.<br>  <br>  As it happens, not all atheists kill people, and there many murderers and serial killers that are Christian.<br>  <br>  You fail.|`|EoDeSDnmaa	I am a believer, but this is not fair nor accurate.

This means the second death, the lake of fire.<br>  <br>  Notice that Hades or Hell itself will be hurled down to lake of fire. So if hell is place of torment, how come it will be hurled to lake of fire? Hell pertains to common grave of men, it symbolizes a place where a large part of human is sleeping in death.

It is noteworthy that at Revelation 11:10 (KJ) reference is made to ‘prophets that torment those dwelling on the earth.’ Such torment results from humiliating exposure by the messages that these prophets proclaim. At Revelation 14:9-11 (KJ) worshipers of the symbolic “beast and his image” are said to be “tormented with fire and brimstone.” This cannot refer to conscious torment after death because “the dead know not any thing.” (Eccl. 9:5, KJ) Then, what causes them to experience such torment while they are still alive? It is the proclamation by God’s servants that worshipers of the “beast and his image” will experience second death, which is represented by “the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone.” The smoke, associated with their fiery destruction, ascends forever because the destruction will be eternal and will never be forgotten. When Revelation 20:10 says that the Devil is to experience ‘torment forever and ever’ in “the lake of fire and brimstone,” what does that mean? Revelation 21:8 (KJ) says clearly that “the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone” means “the second death.” So the Devil’s being “tormented” there forever means that there will be no relief for him; he will be held under restraint forever, actually in eternal death. This use of the word “torment” (from the Greek ba′sa·nos) reminds one of its use at Matthew 18:34, where the same basic Greek word is applied to a ‘jailer.’—RS, AT, ED, NW.|`|44eaCT4Zaa	First I don't believe in the bible or god..

It is evident from the cited texts that there is no release possible from “the second death.” The situation of those in “the second death” corresponds to the outcome warned of in such texts as Hebrews 6:4-8; 10:26,?27; and Matthew 12:32. On the other hand, those represented as gaining “the crown of life” and having part in “the first resurrection” are free from any possibility of harm by the second death. (Re 2:10,?11) These, who are to reign with Christ, receive immortality (deathlessness) and incorruption and hence are beyond the “authority” of the second death.—1Co 15:50-54; Re 20:6; compare Joh 8:51.<br>  <br>  Illustrative Use. Death is personified as a “king” ruling over mankind from the time of Adam (Ro 5:14), along with the rule of King Sin. (Ro 6:12) Thus, these kings are spoken of as exercising their “law” over those subject to their dominion. (Ro 8:2) With Christ’s coming and the provision of the ransom, undeserved kindness began exercising a superior kingship over those accepting God’s gift, “with everlasting life in view.”—Ro 5:15-17,?21.<br>  <br>  Though men, disregarding God’s purposes, may try to make their own pact or covenant with King Death, it will fail. (Isa 28:15,?18) Like a horseman riding behind war and famine, death is pictured as bringing mass mortality to earth’s inhabitants.—Re 6:8; compare Jer 9:21,?22.<br>  <br>  Those spiritually sick or distressed are described as “arriving at the gates of death” (Ps 107:17-20; compare Job 38:17; Ps 9:13), and those passing through such “gates” enter the figurative “house of meeting for everyone living” (Job 30:23; compare 2Sa 12:21-23), with its “interior rooms” (Pr 7:27) and a capacity for victims that is never completely filled. (Hab 2:5) Those going into Sheol are like sheep shepherded by death.—Ps 49:14.<br>  <br>  “The pangs of death.” At Acts 2:24 the apostle Peter spoke of Jesus as being ‘loosed from the pangs of death, for it was not possible for him to continue to be held fast by it.’ The Greek word (o?din′) here translated “pangs” is elsewhere used to mean the pains of childbirth (1Th 5:3) but may also mean travail, pain, calamity, or distress generally. (Mt 24:8) Additionally, it was used by the translators of the Greek Septuagint in rendering the Hebrew word che′vel in texts where the evident meaning is “rope.” (2Sa 22:6; Ps 18:4,?5) A related Hebrew word means “birth pangs,” leading some commentators and lexicographers to suggest that the Greek term (o?din′) used by Luke at Acts 2:24 also had this double meaning, at least in Hellenistic Greek of apostolic times. Thus some translations render the phrase in this verse as “the bands [or bonds] of death.” (NC [Spanish]; Segond, Ostervald [French]) In numerous texts the danger of death is represented as reaching out to snare the threatened one (Pr 13:14; 14:27) with ropes that encircle him and bring him down into “the distressing circumstances of Sheol.” (Ps 116:3) Whereas other texts, already considered, show that there is no consciousness in death, and it is obvious that Jesus was not in any literal pain while dead, nonetheless death is presented as a bitter and distressing experience (1Sa 15:32; Ps 55:4; Ec 7:26) not only in the pain usually preceding it (Ps 73:4,?5) but in the loss of all activity and freedom that its paralyzing grip brings. So, it may be that it is in this sense that Jesus’ resurrection ‘loosed’ him from “the pangs of death,” freeing him from its distressing gripes.|`|qCY7pvj1aa	For the most part when ever the bible speak of a fire like destruction, its normally refering to complete or definite death. If you do research on hell you will find that in biblical times it was just a place were for the most part were they burn trash and other things in a big hole. <br>  <br>  <br>  For example: Jesus Christ associated fire with Gehenna (Mt 5:22; 18:9; Mr 9:47,?48), as did the disciple James, the only Biblical writer besides Matthew, Mark, and Luke to use the word. (Jas 3:6) Some commentators endeavor to link such fiery characteristic of Gehenna with the burning of human sacrifices that was carried on prior to Josiah’s reign and, on this basis, hold that Gehenna was used by Jesus as a symbol of everlasting torment. However, since Jehovah God expressed repugnance for such practice, saying that it was “a thing that I had not commanded and that had not come up into my heart” (Jer 7:31; 32:35), it seems most unlikely that God’s Son, in discussing divine judgment, would make such idolatrous practice the basis for the symbolic meaning of Gehenna. It may be noted that God prophetically decreed that the Valley of Hinnom would serve as a place for mass disposal of dead bodies rather than for the torture of live victims. (Jer 7:32,?33; 19:2, 6, 7, 10,?11) Thus, at Jeremiah 31:40 the reference to “the low plain of the carcasses and of the fatty ashes” is generally accepted as designating the Valley of Hinnom, and a gate known as “the Gate of the Ash-heaps” evidently opened out onto the eastern extremity of the valley at its juncture with the ravine of the Kidron. (Ne 3:13,?14) It seems obvious that such “carcasses” and “fatty ashes” are not related to the human sacrifices made there under Ahaz and Manasseh, since any bodies so offered would doubtless be viewed by the idolaters as “sacred” and would not be left lying in the valley.<br>  Therefore, the Biblical evidence concerning Gehenna generally parallels the traditional view presented by rabbinic and other sources. That view is that the Valley of Hinnom was used as a place for the disposal of waste matter from the city of  Jerusalem. (At Mt 5:30 Ph renders ge′en·na as “rubbish heap.”) Concerning “Gehinnom,” the Jewish commentator David Kimhi (1160-1235?), in his comment on Psalm 27:13, gives the following historical information: “And it is a place in the land adjoining Jerusalem, and it is a loathsome place, and they throw there unclean things and carcasses. Also there was a continual fire there to burn the unclean things and the bones of the carcasses. Hence, the judgment of the wicked ones is called parabolically Gehinnom.”<br>  It is evident that Jesus used Gehenna as representative of utter destruction resulting from adverse judgment by God, hence with no resurrection to life as a soul being possible. (Mt 10:28; Lu 12:4,?5) The scribes and Pharisees as a wicked class were denounced as ‘subjects for Gehenna.’ (Mt 23:13-15,?33) To avoid such destruction, Jesus’ followers were to get rid of anything causing spiritual stumbling, the ‘cutting off of a hand or foot’ and the ‘tearing out of an eye’ figuratively representing their deadening of these body members with reference to sin.—Mt 18:9; Mr 9:43-47; Col 3:5; compare Mt 5:27-30.<br>  Jesus also apparently alluded to Isaiah 66:24 in describing Gehenna as a place “where their maggot does not die and the fire is not put out.” (Mr 9:47,?48) That the symbolic picture here is not one of torture but, rather, of complete destruction is evident from the fact that the Isaiah text dealt, not with persons who were alive, but with “the carcasses of the men that were transgressing” against God. If, as the available evidence indicates, the Valley of Hinnom was a place for the disposal of garbage and carcasses, fire, perhaps increased in intensity by the addition of sulfur (compare Isa 30:33), would be the only suitable means to eliminate such refuse. Where the fire did not reach, worms, or maggots, would breed, consuming anything not destroyed by the fire. On this basis, Jesus’ words would mean that the destructive effect of God’s adverse judgment would not cease until complete destruction was attained.|`|zyxY4dbMaa	What was the purpose of the Rich man and Lazarous story if not to teach us that we want to make decisions for life with God while we are here.|`|4hsl2toNaa	It is symbolic of the second and final death from which there is no chance of a resurrection.

The NIV is popular and has been around for over 25 years now, but is suspected by some of having protestant bias in certain places.  The Jerusalem Bible and New Jerusalem Bible are good too, but consider they are the official catholic bible in English - so they have the advantage of including the extra books that catholic bibles have, if you want them - these are the ones Crazy Pirate refers to as "spurious additions in Greek" (so do the KJV and the RSV, originally, if you can get hold of the full version).

So most people who desire to read it must rely on a translation.<br>  Today, the Bible is the world’s most widely translated book—parts of it being available in over 2,400 languages. Some languages have not just one translation but scores of them. If you have a choice in your language, you surely want to use the very best translation you can find.<br>  To make an informed choice, you need to know the answers to the following questions: What different types of translations are available? What are the strengths and weaknesses of each type of translation? And why should you be cautious when reading some translations of the Bible?<br>  From One Extreme to the Other<br>  Bible translations cover a broad spectrum of styles, but they fall into three basic categories. Interlinear translations are at one end of the spectrum. These translations contain the original-language text along with a word-for-word rendering into the target language.<br>  Paraphrase translations fall at the other end of the spectrum. Translators of these versions freely restate the message of the Bible as they understand it in a way that they feel will appeal to their audience.<br>  A third category embraces translations that endeavor to strike a balance between these two extremes. These versions of the Bible strive to convey the meaning and flavor of the original-language expressions while also making the text easy to read.<br>  Are Word-for-Word Translations Best?<br>  A strictly word-for-word translation is often not the best possible way to capture the meaning of each Bible verse. Why not? There are a number of reasons. Here are two:<br>   1. No two languages are exactly alike in grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. Professor of Hebrew S.?R.?Driver says that languages “differ not only in grammar and roots, but also .?.?. in the manner in which ideas are built up into a sentence.” People who speak different languages think differently. “Consequently,” continues Professor Driver, “the forms taken by the sentence in different languages are not the same.”<br>  Since no language exactly mirrors the vocabulary and grammar of Biblical Hebrew and Greek, a word-for-word translation of the Bible would be unclear or might even convey the wrong meaning. Consider the following examples.<br>  In his letter to the Ephesians, the apostle Paul used an expression that is literally translated “in the (dice) cube of the men.” (Ephesians 4:14, The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures) This expression refers to the practice of cheating others when using dice. In most languages, however, a literal rendering of this allusion makes little sense. Translating this expression as “the trickery of men” is a clearer way to convey the meaning.<br>  When writing to the Romans, Paul used a Greek expression that literally means “to the spirit boiling.” (Romans 12:11, Kingdom Interlinear) Does this wording make sense in your language? The expression actually means to be “aglow with the spirit.”<br>  During one of his most famous speeches, Jesus used an expression that is often translated: “Blessed are the poor in spirit.” (Matthew 5:3) But a literal rendering of this expression is obscure in many languages. In some cases, a strictly literal translation even implies that “the poor in spirit” are mentally unbalanced or lacking in vitality and determination. However, Jesus was here teaching people that their happiness depended, not on satisfying their physical needs, but on recognizing their need for God’s guidance. (Luke 6:20) So such renderings as “those conscious of their spiritual need” or “those who know their need for God” convey more accurately the meaning of this expression.—Matthew 5:3; The New Testament in Modern English.<br>   2. The meaning of a word or an expression may change depending on the context in which it is used. For instance, the Hebrew expression that normally refers to the human hand may have a wide variety of meanings. Depending on the context, this word may, for example, be rendered “control,” “openhandedness,” or “power.” (2?Samuel 8:3; 1?Kings 10:13; Proverbs 18:21) In fact, this particular word is translated in over 40 different ways in the English edition of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.<br>  Because the context can affect the way a word is translated, the New World Translation uses nearly 16,000 English expressions to translate some 5,500 Biblical Greek terms, and it uses over 27,000 English expressions to translate about 8,500 Hebrew terms. Why this variety in the way words are translated?|`|nQvcqVkNaa	Bible scholar Jason BeDuhn wrote a book in 2003 analyzing various translations of the NT.

bqkfu6Diaa	Sociopath is a scientific term. Christians, who already have problems with science, will refuse to believe that a person is incapable of feeling sorry for their actions. Or in rare cases, such as mental retardation where it's pretty obvious that the person is very different and incapable of functioning like we do, Christians will claim that this person gets something like a free pass to heaven. Since the retarded person is incapable of understating salvation, the rules do not apply to them.<br>  <br>  And if you are capable of understanding, Christians will cut you no slack. If it doesn't feel wrong, that is no excuse. They will say that the devil has clouded your mind or something to that effect. They will expect you to pray to God and ask him to show you how it is wrong and help you understand.|`|y1JJhQ0Vaa	If I'm not mistaken, sociopaths know right and wrong, but do not feel guilt for their actions. So, if they do good, why not? If they do evil, shall they not be punished? The soul of a sociopath is presumably no different from normal peoples', and after purgatory would probably be sorry. After that, Heaven, aye what? If there is no good in them, I'd suppose they'd just stop existing instead.<br>  <br>  <br>  Second question: Lust, for example, is a natural feeling, not a sin. Acting on lust, or exciting one's lust for pleasure, though, might well be. Lust is meant to be a motivation to keep humanity going. Acting in such a manner as to contribute to that is perfectly alright, and certainly the very existence of lust is no-one's fault.<br>  <br>  P.S. I am not a Christian, just working within a framework I am somewhat unclear about, so please forgive me if I said anything contrary to authoritative Christian doctrine.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	God is  justified in his dealing with his children.

Even you...|`|C0eo1wSTaa	Questions like this one totally debunk the trinity, hell torment and immortal conscience heresy of the present day Christianity. <br>  They(the sociopaths) will be resurrected and given a second chance as a new perfect being at the final resurrection. That's if your definition is correct and they are mentally ill. <br>  Of course if you believe in hell torment that is not a possibility. But I believe what the bible says: the penalty for sin is DEATH, and God's gift for us is LIFE AT THE RESURRECTION all of this makes perfect sense.  <br>  Jesus was dead for 3 days, he said that himself, and he wasn't in heaven at that time. He was unconscious and his spirit(not his conscience, that's a big difference) was with God.That's because he was the Son of God, not God himself. God can't die and God can't live in a finite reality and come to Earth as a human. <br>  <br>  The conclusion is this and it is simple to understand: all humans die like Adam did and all humans resurrect as Jesus did. Those who are perfect( bible respecting, bible reading, bible understanding Christians) will not come to judgment. All the rest will be given a period of time to repent and learn the real theology.This is where the sociopaths fit in.After that period Satan will test them once again. After that period of time they will be judged and the ones who deserve to live will live forever just like the Christians did. The rest will be sent to the second death, that means total destruction forever, even their spirit will be destroyed. But as you can see almost everybody who is sincere with himself and God will be given a chance. <br>  The only ones who are not going to be resurrected are the people who fight against the holy spirit(God's will and active force). That includes all those who mock God just to get him angry and those who reject God knowing what they are doing is incorrect. <br>  Another beautiful thing is that all the people who haven't heard the gospel( like the Indians and all of the pagan religious people who lived before Christ's resurrection and pretty much all the people of antiquity) will be given a second chance. They also weren't tormented in hell for thousands of years as the heretics claim.|`|AA11690436	Well, Universal Unitarians believe that all paths lead to God.

YfwgvPaCaa	Here is your answer.<br>  The Jewish version of head covering - the kippah or yarmulke worn by both men or women - is to remind them that they are not above God and heaven. To affirm their submission and devotion to their God. <br>  The traditional use of scarves or small kerchief or handkerchief on top of the head for women, as well as some men - in most Abrahamic religions usually Catholicism or Greek orthodox - is to remind them of their lower status in the cast system because of Eves sin but also to remind them that they are there in reverence of God and that (a woman's hair was a source of temptation for men or a sign of beauty and self ego) their very presence should be of the utmost submissive state. <br>  Many beliefs believe in some sort of head covering and many have different reasons. But for the beliefs you stated, this is their reasons. <br>  It is in reverence, devotion, and a sign of submission to their God.|`|AORcLwTNaa	Islamically , it stops men from looking at women inappropriately, and it respects a woman|`|DIlNnjf8aa	In Islam, the Holy Qur'an instructs both men and women to cover themselves properly.

Men are also required to dress modestly.<br>  <br>  Note: Rafal's answer to why Muslim women wear head scarves is ridiculous. That just implies that men are completely helpless to "temptation" and that if women do not cover up, they deserve to be harassed or raped. The Muslim head scarf for women was supposed to be a sign of modesty. However, the tradition has been twisted, and now women are forced to wear full body coverings (burqa), sometimes having to cover their eyes as well.

0sOnf2YQaa	This is not how God intends for you to live.<br>  Without realizing it, you are engaging in two <br>  distinct and unprofitable acts.<br>  <br>  1. Not trusting God<br>  2. Coming close to convincing yourself you care more than God does.<br>  <br>  Had you never been born, these same individuals would still be in need of salvation and could only receive it the same way they can now - through Christ alone and not through you.<br>  The lake of fire (often spoken of as hell) is indeed real.<br>  People that cannot accept God's holiness, wrath and justice will chide you for believing Him regarding it.<br>  Do not be afraid to trust God or be swayed by double minded people that would encourage you to disbelieve the Word of God because they they themselves do not trust God and may think you foolish.<br>  The man or woman that stands firm on the Word of God WILL appear foolish and there is nothing you can do about it but to take your eyes off of them and put them on Christ where they belong.<br>  <br>  Continue to pray for people but pray for yourself as well - that God would ease your heart for you are carrying this burden in a way He did not intend.<br>  Yes, praying for people is a burden but you are bearing it as if you are going it alone - and you are not.<br>  <br>  You are also expecting to see immediate results for your faithfulness for preaching the Gospel, yet that is not usually the way God works.<br>  Often times, an indidvidual will meet several people sent by Christ over the course of time and you will not neccesarily be privy to what happens next.<br>  Years ago, I worked with a young woman that gave her life to Christ immediately following a shift at work.<br>  But you know what? I was not the first person to share the Gospel with her.<br>  The seed had been sown years prior.<br>  I am convinced that this is one way that God ensures that if we look honestly at the situation and outcome, we will see that we did not "save" them but Jesus Christ the Saviour did.|`|SOlh57iKaa	Thats because the common teaching that God punishes people by burning them forever is not found in the bible.|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	Ecclesiastes 7:8 says that God knows the end from the beginning.<br>  Jeremiah 29:11 says God's thoughts toward us are for peace, not evil.<br>  Winning friends and family over to Christ is not your responsibility.

I have a been where you are, to a certain extent. I will not try to convince you that God does not exist. If you come to that conclusion, it will be in your own time. But I will share with you something that I was told when I started to have some of the same questions you seem to be asking. When I asked about the eternal burning hell of the bible, a friend and trusted pastor told me this.  <br>  "Hell is not real. It is simply a metaphor."  <br>  I was shocked. What did he mean hell was not real? He went own to tell me that "hell" was actually a garbage dump. Just outside the city of Jerusalem was a valley, called Gehenna where garbage was dumped. The fires here were always kept burning, to keep down the trash and the smell. Bodies of criminals and people that were denied proper burial were burned here. It is also thought that is place, because it was outside the city walls and not subject to Jewish authority that it was used as a place of religious child-sacrifice to Moloch by the Canaanites outside the city. He tried to call by fears by telling me that Hell was not a rely place. That after death those that were not saved simply died. Nothing else...death was the end of their existence. There are even references to this that are supported by the bible.  <br>  The word "Hell" was first used in Joshua 15:8 in the Hebrew scripture "Then the border went up the valley of Ben-hinnom to the slope of the Jebusite on the south (that is, Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain which is before the valley of Hinnom to the west, which is at the end of the valley of Rephaim toward the north."  <br>  The word Gehenna traces its origin to the Hebrew Gêhinn?m (also Guy ben-Hinnom) meaning the "Valley of Hinnom's son". <br>  Do you see the connection? Please look it up for yourself, see if I am telling the truth.  <br>   <br>  What my friend that pastor did not know was that when he told me this, I started to rethink everything I thought I knew about religion. If "Hell" was not real, then what else was not real. How would I pick and choose what was real and what was not? Doesn't the bible say not to "add to or take away" from the scripture? I truly do feel sorry for you, and I hope that you find some measure of peace. But please, try not to work yourself up to much. It will only do you harm in the end.|`|0fc4be2c7fe0b3251308b8c4479f2d3baa	It is a sad reality to envision the majority of mankind, absent from God's glory.  It is distressing to see the wayward and know that you can't do it alone and even then you can't save everybody.  <br>  <br>  You can only lead a horse to water.  You can't make it drink.  Basically just arm yourself with the truth and just plug along.  I had a problem with this for awhile, especially when I first started in the youth ministry.  So many teens with so varying ideas, views and backgrounds.  I oft felt that I had to save each and every one of them, and would distress greatly before that challenge.  It is still my challenge, my goal, but I understand that I can only do so much.  Unfortunately, many (so-called) Christians are guilty of not doing enough.  Most sit idly by, shying away from Gospel conversation, even when it is started by someone else.  Society has us programed that it is necessary to fit it, which means don't stand out.  Peer pressure, don't offend anyone, don't say the wrong thing, what will they think...all common fears.<br>  <br>  It is extremely difficult and sad to envision so many a lost soul, turning their backs to the Creator.  But there is always a chance, and never give up on anyone, because our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, hasn't given up on us, as evident of his Death, Burial and Resurrection.<br>  <br>  Do not be overcome with discouragement, for every soul saved is one more soul pried from Satan's grasp.

It sounds like you've developed something of an obsession, and it will be very difficult for you.  You've been victimized by both dishonest people who want to control you through fear and people like yourself, who are only trying to do what's right.<br>  <br>  Understand that the god that has been described to you is impossible.  God could not love us and still send us to Hell.  God might be just, but infinite punishment for finite crimes is not justice.  <br>  <br>  Understand that the god described to you is capable of presenting every man woman and child on earth with irrefutable proof of its existence.  Understand that this would not violate their free will (which apologists typically use as an excuse for why God does not do so).  Understand that the concept of free-will doesn't even appear in the bible anyway.<br>  <br>  Consider how utterly terrifying Hell is, but that it is not a difficult or inventive thing to imagine.  Hell could be imagined by anyone who simply takes the threat of something physically distressing, like torture and fire, and expands it by saying it will go on forever.<br>  <br>  Think how terrifying Hell is.  Understand that once a child is indoctrinated with a fear of Hell they will fear it forever, that the fear is so strong that even if they stop believing in it they will still fear it, that it will haunt their memories.  Consider how useful it would be to anyone wanting to control and subdue others to be able to inflict such fear on them, and consider again how easy the concept is to invent.<br>  <br>  I know it's frightening.  I can't really imagine how hard it must be for someone like you, ensnared into a religion that believes in a truly monstrous god, to break free.  But please try.  You know what you've been told about God terrifies you, you know you consider your god a monster for inflicting such torture on people, except you're so afraid of your monster-god you're afraid to even think it.<br>  <br>  You are afraid of a bogey-man, and that bogey-man is so frightening that you can't even consider the possibility he's not really there.  But you'll live the rest of your life afraid of him if you don't.<br>  <br>  It took me several years to lose my belief in god, and I never had a solid picture of a monster in my head like you do.  But the way I did it was by asking questions, looking for the source of the knowledge religious people claimed to have, searching for arguments that proved the existence of God, and coming up empty.  You can do the same if you're willing to actually question instead of assuming whatever answer you're given is valid without thinking about it.<br>  <br>  Try things like this:  Assuming an ultimate creator-god exists, we know for a fact that not all writings claiming to have divine authority are authentic, or there wouldn't be such a diversity of religion in the world.  Knowing that, you can't assume any ancient writing has divine authority simply because it claims to.  What sort of measures would the real God put in place to make his directions unmistakable?  Do these measures exist anywhere?<br>  <br>  Any time any person tells you something about God or what God wants, ask yourself how they could know such a thing?  If you ask God a question out loud he doesn't answer in kind, you know that.  So all these people who claim to speak for god, are they really speaking for god, or are they just arrogant?|`|qG4ozrH1aa	Simple 2Tim 2:15.

When you die, you sleep until our Heavenly Father will come on the clouds to take us home. The hell they are talking about in the Word is actually death. There could be only eternal life or death. When that hell comes it will be rain of fire from heaven that will devour the unrighteous people. In the first place we shouldn't be worried or afraid. If we are right with our Heavenly Father. Then there is nothing to be worried about. Our Heavenly Father doesn't want us to live in fear. He wants us to live peaceful. Go and read revelations about what will happen...|`|D3EGS7nvaa	I have a somewhat Christian Inclusivism philosophy.<br>  <br>  God's universal and final judgment is according to the actions and motives of humanity--NOT to one's "exposure" to the gospel. <br>  Romans describes a moral purity that is theoretically attainable by ANYONE. <br>  God "will give to each person according to what he has done." To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life. But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger. There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile. For God does not show favoritism. (Romans 2) <br>  <br>  Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait till the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men's hearts. At that time each will receive his praise from God. (I Cor 4.4) <br>  <br>  All a man's ways seem innocent to him, but motives are weighed by the LORD. (Prov 16.2) <br>  <br>  Since we cannot demonstrate that Christianity is better than all the other options, however, the happy conclusion is that we are not obliged to do so. Instead, we should follow the apostolic pattern. Do we really think that Jesus' early band undertook a comprehensive study of all of the religions available in the Roman world in the first century and then concluded that Christianity was the best option? No. "We declare to you what was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the word of life" (I John 1:1).<br>  <br>  God has not confined his goodness to Christian cultures. He has sent not only his rain on the just and the unjust, but his law, a sense of himself, and the institutions of human civilization to all peoples, however much those gifts have been repressed, confused, adulterated, or corrupted (Rom. 1). There is beauty, goodness, and truth almost everyplace we look in other religions and civilizations, however much we must also question or even condemn therein.<br>  <br>  Richard Swinburne argues that a person who has done something wrong is under obligation to atone for the action. Atonement involves four features (though not all are required in every case): repentance, apology, reparations, and penance. "They are all contributions to removing as much of the consequences of the past act as logically can be removed by the wrongdoer. The consequences are, first, the harm caused by and distinguishable from the act of causing it and, second, the purposive attitude of the wrongdoer towards the victim manifested in the causing of the harm."<br>  <br>  In repentance, guilty persons acknowledge that they have done the wrong act, take responsibility for it, admit that it was wrong, and affirm that the action is contrary to their present ideals and purposes (what Swinburne terms "distancing oneself from the act"). Repentance is necessary only in cases of subjective guilt, that is, where persons know that what they are doing is wrong and intend to act in that fashion, or act negligently in a morally culpable way. Objective guilt, which results from objectively wrong actions done with neither knowledge of their wrongness, the intent to do wrong, nor morally culpable negligence, needs no repentance, since the moral norms of the offender remain the same as before the wrongful act was committed.<br>  <br>  Swinburne's second feature of atonement is apology to the victim, which is the public expression of repentance. Apology, he holds, is necessary for forgiveness, for whether the guilt is objective or subjective, one has harmed another by the wrong action. The third and fourth features are reparation for the wrong done and penance. Reparation is an attempt to make good or compensate the other for the harm done and losses suffered. Penance is the something more required to show that the apology was sincere, that one truly wants to distance oneself from the wrong actions. Though generally necessary for atonement, reparation and penance are not required for less serious wrongs.<br>  <br>  Christians teach that our sins require atonement. Swinburne understands this to mean that offenders are obliged to repent, apologize, and give as reparation and penance something of value to God whom they have offended. However, due to the enormity of the sin, which is against the holiness of God, and the poverty of their own good, they lack adequate resources to make proper reparation and penance. However, Christians can appropriate Christ's life and death as a sacrifice, "an offering made available to us men to offer as our reparation and penance.... It is simply a costly penance and reparation sufficient for a merciful God to let men off the rest." God allows the Son to sacrifice himself so that we can apply the merits of his innocent death to atone for our sins. <br>  <br>  After their death God informs nonchristians of good will about the salvific death of Christ and makes available to them for their acceptance the grace that results from Christ's death. This solution requires that individuals live again after their death and at that time be given a chance to apologize and request God's forgiveness.<br>  <br>  Cannot the offended (God) forgive those who by repenting have expressed deep sorrow for their actions, even if they have not apologized to the offended? That someone is sorry for his or her action but has not apologized to the offended is not very plausible if the offender knows whom and how he or she has offended. But it is more plausible in certain other types of cases, for example, where offenders are ignorant of whom they have offended or have no way of contacting those whom they offended. Here it could be sufficient for the offended simply to know that the offender sincerely repents of the offense and has apologized to those whom he or she thought was offended.|`|e1da218fa360d619acec56b3218b6e6caa	Keep praying for your friends and family that are non-believers.

GGmaSpHDaa	The Message is a paraphrase of the Bible and was written by a wonderful Christian Scholar and Pastor, Eugene Petersen.  According to Petersen, he wrote The Message as a catchy and earthy rephrasing of scripture to reach people who for whatever reason couldn’t relate to a regular translation and never read the Bible because of that. <br>  <br>  Petersen has stated plainly that it not intended as a substitute for a regular translation.  Petersen does a good job of getting the general meaning of Scripture across in a fresh and sometimes entertaining way.  <br>  <br>  I think that if one can’t handle a regular translation, The Message is a great place to start.  A regular Bible reader would enjoy the Message for a fresh rendering of familiar passages or as an aid when a verse in a regular translation is difficult.  Because The Message is a paraphrase, it lacks the precision of a translation and therefore shouldn’t be one’s regular main Bible for study. <br>  <br>  The Amplified Bible in the New Testament was completed in the late 1950s, before the easy reading translations and paraphrases were completed. The Old Testament was then completed a few years later. The Amplified Bible gets its name due to its paraphrastic amplifications of passages and alternate renderings which try to provide helps within the text itself. <br>  <br>  The Amplified Bible was originally completed by a person with little original language training. After the author’s death, the publishers, The Lockman Foundation later hired some scholars to revise and correct inaccuracies. <br>  <br>  I’m sure Christians found the Amplified Bible helpful. But I think high quality paraphrases and translations made since are more useful and have obsoleted the Amplified Bible.  Even the revised Amplified Bible isn’t regarded very highly for its accuracy. Plus, alternate words are provided without clues as to why one might be preferred over another, a prescription for error by the reader.<br>  <br>  After 20+ years of reading the Bible and studying translation differences, my conclusion is this:  Many of the questions new readers have of the Bible are well known and are covered concisely in the notes of good study bibles.  I think the best approach for reading scripture is to get a thick study bible that uses a regular translation. Refer to a paraphrase like The Message in difficult passages.<br>  <br>  If after looking at study bible note and reading the passage again in The Message, there is still a question, then jot it down and move on.  You will be surprised that by continuing to read and reread the Bible, how many of the questions vanish as other parts of scripture provide keys to understanding.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  After posting I saw your additional details.  Keep The Message you just purchased.  It will be helpful and you can use it as described above. <br>  <br>  The KJV is very difficult for most modern readers because of the changes in English over the last 400 years since it was written. <br>  <br>  If you read at a 10th grade or higher level, I recommend replacing the parallel bible with the ESV Study Bible.  The ESV is an essentially literal translation.  It is the product of recent scholarship, so is it more accurate than the KJV and much easier to read. The study notes are excellent. <br>  <br>  The ESV text is a little easier to read than the NKJV. But with the ESV study bible notes I think they will help you quite a bit.  You can checkout the ESV Study Bible for a limited time online to see if it is for you. <a href="http://www.crossway.org/page/news.2009.03.02" rel="nofollow">http://www.crossway.org/page/news.2009.0...</a><br>  <br>  The next step in easier reading is the NET Study Bible which you can read online or download a free copy at Bible.org.|`|IHzv611caa	I don't k now much about the amplified version, but the Message is not the best option.

And through the darkness of unbelief, he descends to the lowest of the low and falls to a position fit for Hell. For belief connects man to the All-Glorious Maker; it is a relation. Thus, man acquires value by virtue of the Divine art and inscriptions of the Dominical Names which become apparent in him through belief. Unbelief severs the relation, and due to that severance the Dominical art is concealed. His value then is only in respect to the matter of his physical being. And since this matter has only a transitory, passing, temporary animal life, its value is virtually nothing. We shall explain this mystery by means of a comparison:<br>  <br>  For example: among man's arts, the value of the materials used and that of the art are entirely different. Sometimes they are equal, sometimes the material is more valuable, and sometimes it happens that five dollars' worth of art is to be found in material like iron worth five cents. Sometimes, even, an antique work of art is worth a million while the material of which it is composed is not worth five cents. And so, if such a work of art is taken to the antiques market and related to a brilliant and accomplished artist of former times, and announced mentioning the artist and that art, it may be sold for a million dollars. Whereas if it is taken to the scrap dealers, the only price received will be for the five cent's worth of iron.Thus, man is such an antique work of art of Almighty God. He is a most subtle and graceful miracle of His power whom He created to manifest all his Names and their inscriptions, in the form of a miniature specimen of the universe. If the light of belief enters his being, all the meaningful inscriptions on him may be read. As one who believes, he reads them consciously, and through that relation, he causes others to read them. That is to say, the Dominical art in man becomes apparent through meanings like, "I am the creature and artefact of the All-Glorious Maker. I manifest His mercy and munificence." That is, belief, which consists of being connected to the Maker, makes apparent all the works of art in man. Man's value is in accordance with that Dominical art, and by virtue of being a mirror to the Eternally Besought One. In this respect insignificant man becomes God's addressee and a guest of the Sustainer worthy of Paradise superior to all other creatures.However, should unbelief, which consists of the severance of the relation, enter man's being, then all those meaningful inscriptions of the Divine Names are plunged into darkness and cannot be read. For if the Maker is forgotten, the spiritual aspects which look to Him will not be comprehended, they will be as though reversed. The majority of those meaningful sublime arts and elevated inscriptions will be hidden. The remainder, those that may be seen with the eye, will be attributed to lowly causes, Nature, and chance, and will fall utterly from value. While each is a brilliant diamond, each becomes a piece of dull glass. His importance looks only to his animal, physical being. And as we said, the aim and fruit of his physical being is only to pass a brief and partial life as the most impotent, needy, and grieving of animals. Then it decays and departs. See how unbelief destroys human nature, and transforms it from diamonds into coal.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  SECOND POINT<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2880&t=First+Chapter" rel="nofollow">http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2880&...</a>|`|YLUeS2MOaa	Religion was the first way people ever came up with explanations for things they couldn't understand, and the reasoning stuck.

gwM3ZXuEaa	Good afternoon, teachers and schoolmates!<br>  <br>  Today, I would like to share a story of mine with you.<br>  <br>  It was a sunny afternoon. My family and I were happily riding bicycles together when we saw, and entered, a castle with special pictures on the walls. It seemed that there were many stories in these pictures. There were many kinds of colorful fish in the lake of the castle, and beside the lake were also colorful flowers and trees. The scenes of the castle were so strange that I thought there must be something wrong, and most of all, there were not any people.<br>  <br>  After leaving the castle, I saw a forest where many animals lived. Suddenly a rhinoceros rushed toward us. I was scared by the roar and the rumbling of its steps, so we left in a hurry. Being sure that we were out of danger, I lay on a grassy lawn in the breeze. It was a very wonderful feeling.<br>  <br>  When we rode again, my brother and I were chasing each other. I rode faster, faster and faster. Then I felt that I became lighter, lighter and lighter. I was flying up in the sky! I could see higher and farther! I enjoyed viewing the beautiful green landscape, breathing the crisp fresh air and listening to the happy chirps of little birds.<br>  <br>  Then I saw a splendid outstanding building. Wow! It was the famous Taipei 101! I had ridden from the country to the big city. In the meantime, however, the landscape was transforming! The tall green trees became tall buildings. The sweet scent of flowers became the foul odor of sewage. The happy chirps of birds became noises from the factories. The bright blue sky became dirty gray because of the automobile exhaust.<br>  <br>  I felt that the air was running out! I could not breathe any more!<br>  <br>  I shouted, “Mother, Father and younger brother, where are you!”<br>  <br>  Then I woke up. Oh! Oh! It was a dream, and my face was covered by a blanket! I could breathe again.<br>  <br>  Although it was a dream, it gave me an inspiration: we have only one Earth, and we have to protect it!<br>  <br>  <br>  Thank you for listening!|`|KOd5Spehaa	well you might wanna change up where it says    "There were many kinds of colorful fish in the lake of the castle and beside the lake were also colorful flowers and trees" <br>  "in the lake of the castle"...change that up a bit..|`|bb06GQ5Paa	I think that's good.

iPNOVR6Gaa	I would assume you at least possessed the predisposition to be lesbian or bisexual before you were raped.  If you were completely heterosexual, but hated men, you would choose not to be in any sexual relationship whatsoever, because true heterosexuals are repulsed by the idea of having sex with the same sex.|`|FpMS47sXaa	With cases of abuse and rape, the situation can be different. For most gay people, we have no control over who we like. However, it has been know to happen to people that have suffered a horrible experience as you have. It's the minds way of protecting the person from what they perceive as a threat. It's actually a pretty normal psychological event.<br>  <br>  My advise is to seek counseling. It is possible that you are not actually gay, but it would be wise to seek out someone you can talk to about this, that can give you proper analysis.<br>  <br>  I hope all the best for you.<br>  <br>  Remember, you are not a fault for what has happened to you. You are a victim on this crime. You need to know that you are a wonderful special person. The criminal is the bad guy. Don't allow this crime to have this effect on you - in the long run - this guy isn't worth it. You control you - not him.<br>  In time, this will mean more to you, than you realize right now.|`|mYe6TDmzaa	For some maybe yes.  For me no.

I am sorry that this has happened to you. Please seek some counseling not to deal with your sexuality but to deal with the pain that you have endured as a victim.|`|VCz1CtiLaa	I have a cousin who is a lesbian, she had a very abusive father and a mother who didn't care about her. To my knowledge she has never been with a man. I have always thought people were born gay and I still feel that way, however I do think nurture plays a big role as well.|`|b1233d2957b6685f6644485ce17a6f62aa	No, I don't think so. There are many rape survivors who are straight, and there are lesbians who have never been sexually assaulted.  I'm bi, and have been attracted to women a couple of times.  I was never assaulted.|`|3sKU83sPaa	Well, everyone faces different situations and everyone has a different outlook on their sexuality. It is personal for you, and you're really the only one who can answer this question. <br>  <br>  For me, sex isn't really an issue - men and women are both attractive and beautiful. I prefer being in a relationship with a woman for various reasons, but mainly because I haven't met any really good men. My girlfriend is great, and I don't see how anyone can best her (male or female). <br>  <br>  There were no good men in my life when I was growing up and I had a similar situation happen with the rape, but when I look back, I have to admit that I was always into women. <br>  <br>  My advice would be for you to really examine yourself - especially if this is important to you. Take some time to just sit and think - or grab som paper and a pen and jot a few things down. Think about any friends that you had crushes on as a kid (males or females), write down the different factors that you feel may have contributed to your like/dislike of men or women, and consider anything else that may have had something to do with it.<br>  <br>  Many people say that you are born gay, many others say that it is a result of life. While these are both strong opinions, neither one is provable in any way. There are many, many theories about sexual orientation. While the jury is still out for you, I would urge you to consider anything that makes sense to you. <br>  <br>  The truth is, no one can give you an honest answer to this question, but there is nothing wrong with forming your own theory.<br>  <br>  :-)|`|hONahfP2aa	Absolutely.<br>  <br>  I'm Bisexual, i have been since i was very very very young, But i was molested when i was 11, and since then i have been leaning much more towards women. Before that, i leaned more towards men. <br>  It can definitely have an effect on the way you perceive love, the way you fall in love, who you are willing to love, and your outlook on people in general. I definitely tend to scope out people who look like the man who molested me, i am much more judgmental now, i hate that about myself, but i can't help it. I am constantly trying to overcome my tendency to judge, but it happens.<br>  But it is in no way a bad thing to love girls instead of boys.<br>  I hope you aren't ashamed, you should be proud.<br>  Live your life the way nature intended you to be, it's the only right way.|`|po4j4xhAaa	Are you really attracted to women or are you just afraid of men?<br>  <br>  I'm sorry that such a horrible thing happened to you.  Please get counseling to heal yourself.|`|cVewVL0Taa	It could....but not for me. I've never had anything traumatic happen to me with men... I just like women. That's it.

Amen.|`|2SEVDjpnaa	We exist within the universe. If God exists (and I believe he does, although I can't test this, scientifically), then he must exist outside the universe and must not be bound by the same laws of time and space that we are.<br>  <br>  If you are to still say "Well, who created God?" It all goes back to some un-caused cause- a 'God', or 'being', of some sort.|`|SRFfK0BPaa	The atheist Bertrand Russell wrote in his book "Why I am Not a Christian" that if it is true that all things need a cause then God must also need a cause. He concluded from this that if God needed a cause then God was not God (and if God is not God then of course there is no God). This was basically a slightly more sophisticated form of the childlike question, "Who made God?" Even a child knows that things do not come from nothing, so if God is a "something" then He must have a cause as well, right?<br>  <br>  The question is tricky because it sneaks in the false assumption that God came from somewhere and then asks where that might be. The answer is that the question does not even make sense. It is like asking, "What does blue smell like?" Blue is not in the category of things that have odor, so the question itself is flawed. In the same way, God is not in the category of things that are created, or come into existence, or are caused. God is uncaused and uncreated - He simply exists.<br>  <br>  How do we know this? Well, we know that from nothing, nothing comes. So if there was ever a time when there was absolutely nothing in existence then nothing would have ever come to exist. But things do exist. Therefore, since there could never have been absolutely nothing, something had to have always been existing. That ever-existing thing is what we call God.<br>  <br>  God is the father of creation|`|jN5SXl5Caa	He came from Alpha Centari or a far away star in the sirius constellation.|`|exRfWIRKaa	The fertile imaginations of superstitious men.|`|iYelQdukaa	Science will NOT give you the answers you seek, but Only The <br>  Word of God...

For every material effect, there had to first be a cause and the cause had to be sufficient to have given the result.<br>  <br>  This basic law of cause and effect is used and understood in everyday life.<br>  <br>  If, for example, a truck was going down the highway and all of a sudden spun out of control and crashed, a person may ask, “What caused the truck to do that?”<br>  <br>  Now suppose the driver says it was caused by the truck colliding with a mosquito and the force of that impact caused the truck to spin out of control.  No one would believe that because a mosquito is not a sufficient cause to have resulted in the truck spinning out of control.<br>  <br>  So what caused the universe we see around us?  The Christian would say God.<br>  <br>  Then people try to use this same reasoning to ask, “What caused God?”<br>  <br>  But notice, I said, “every material thing had a cause that came before it and was greater than it.”<br>  <br>  God, however, is not a “material thing”.  He is spiritual.  Science does not deal with the spiritual.  God cannot be tested, measured, observed, directly examined or experimented upon.<br>  <br>  God may better be described as energy instead of matter.<br>  <br>  The same system of science tells us, “Energy can neither be created, nor destroyed.”  Science, therefore, even recognizes that there is something that is eternal.  God is in that eternal realm!|`|IS7Xubkfaa	If God is what people say He is,  then He always was and always is. It is hard for mere mortal human beings to grasp the concept.

zc47c39daa	Until you can rule out all possibilities, you can't determine whether it's spirits or not.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, go with your gut. If you truly feel there are energies, spirits communicating in your house do research on your home. Previous owners, anyone deceased live in that house before they died, etc. This can help when trying to conclude whether or not it's spirits.<br>  <br>  Are you absolutely positive it is no one outside of your home? Next to your home? Back yard, people walking by, etc? When it occurs search for the source. I know some people just want to conclude it's spirits, but it's also important to really look into the situation before doing so.<br>  <br>  Your mother being sensitive to energies can result in you inheriting her genes. I did through the female side of my mom's family. (I'm a walking weirdo. x) ) But really look into the situation.<br>  <br>  I don't think your crazy or a whack job, etc- I think you just want some answers. Do your research, search for the source, and maybe try meditating on the problem to find a solution. Good luck!|`|BQ0y50Nvaa	There may not be many explanations as to what you are hearing, but I guarantee you one thing, ghosts are waaaaaaay down on the list of possibilities.

Often, after departing this world, a spirit may have left some unfinished business here that is preventing them from moving on to the next plane of existence, taking the next step in a wonderful journey. <br>  <br>  When this happens next, try to be calm and think soothing thoughts, do not fear, most spirits in general mean no harm. When you hear the voices, clear your thoughts and open your mind. Try to catch the message the spirit may be sending you. Often it is just a simple task that you can perform with no harm to yourself or others, and you may be able to help this poor spirit move on to the next step level in this evolution of our continued existence.|`|XGPML3Lsaa	Ive been thinking along these lines myself...but i'm torn.

In our day we can say u are hearing voices due to a mental or physical condition or abnormality.  You might be developing schizophrenia for all we know but what our society says its NOT is the spiritual world, the world that the majority cant observe, feel, or measure.  BUT THERE are THINGS we cannot EXPLAIN! I feel like I'm super sensitive I know when there is someone in the room that others cannot feel, or hear but I feel the presence.  I hear the whispers others aren't sensitive enough to pick up! You may be the same way! Especially If ur mom had the sensitivity too, thats where mine comes form|`|j4gxic8Oaa	Yes, it is quite possible you are "clairaudient".("clear-hearing") This is like "clairvoyant" ("clear-seeing') except it involves hearing instead of seeing spirits. It could also be that you need more B vitamins in your diet as well; people who are vitamin B-deficient frequently report "hearing voices". There may be a connection: Vitamin B deprivation may weaken the psychic aura and make some people more psychically sensitive (This is only my own theory). You can try taking vitamins and see if the "hearing voices" thing decreases. If not, then you are most likely a clairaudient.|`|vBIwaQ0qaa	It is possible, I don't doubt you at all. Try putting out one of those hand help tape recorders or any other device that tapes sound/voices. If anything is going on it will show up on a recording device.<br>  <br>  I have heard my name being called, as plain as day. It's my mom's voice and when I turn around to look, no one is there. It's her voice, I can't mistaken it. She passed away 24 years ago this coming July.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8i4BMbEsaa	wow! You must be a descendant of the Ghost Clan. I hear that only the people who have someone in their family that became a ghost when they died can see and hear them. You could be one and it's a wonderful gift. Don't even try to get rid of it, having it will keep you and those close to you safe from evil spirits forever.|`|Qcp2HtoUaa	Maybe you are just hearing your neighbors talking inside their homes, it's happened to me and for a second I thought of ghosts, but it was actually my neighbors TV I was hearing.  :D|`|5ijejr55aa	i beleive that ppl CAN actually hear and see them, i also saw a report on TV that claimed two teenagers could hear ans see them, and they said it was kinda passed on in the family...|`|kX0T1urdaa	No. Most likely demons.

Listen closely.|`|4PK0hiWeaa	It's either ghosts or auditory hallucinations.|`|AA12384132	Brenzie, If one or both of your parents are sensitive to certain aspect of the paranormal, Then the chances of you being just as sensitive to similar aspects of the paranormal is very good.... Now I know that many people here on yahoo answers can be very rude and very jealous to people that are gifted in a multitude of aspects... But nevertheless there are people that can hear paranormal creatures communicate... But you need to understand this... No one can communicate with the dead period, So what you are hearing is demonic sources that are messing with your head and yes the unwary can get caught up into a BS situation and these people are made to look insane when they are not even close to being insane... So what you will have to do is to find your own way to shut them down so that you can no longer hear them... And once you find that method to shut them out You will be able to find your points of normalcy once again... Now if you have any questions drop me some e-mail and I will see what I can do to help you.........|`|psLk5fDGaa	There's a good chance that being a sensitive is hereditary. I'd try to pay more attention to what they say next time you hear it. Maybe your answers are closer then you think. Be careful about messing with the paranormal... You should really weigh out the outcomes before doing anything rash like an EVP.|`|sy7ytm9Kaa	Check your area to see if your home sits near intersecting streets or neighborhoods.  Same thing happens in my home, but it is due to the positioning of my windows allowing for voices to carry into my home from an intersection of two neighborhoods about 1/4 mile way.|`|9vTWgiGgaa	You might be. Who knows. Only the sensitives can hear them. When I was eight years old, I used to hear them too, but as I grew older, they kind of stopped. They start when I'm home alone.|`|dQcPV4Rqaa	WELL THIS WILL PROBABLY BE THE STRANGEST ANSWER THAT YOU GET...BUT I SWEAR IT IS THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH....HERE GOES...<br>  <br>  I HAD A VERY GOOD FRIEND WHO BEGAN HEARING VOICES, HE HEARD THEM WHEN HE WAS ALL ALONE...THERE WERE NO OTHER HOUSES NEAR HIS HOME, AS HE LIVED IN THE COUNTRY.<br>  THIS JUST STARTED HAPPENING OUT OF THE BLUE..NIGHT, DAY IT DIDN'T MATTER...IT HAPPENED WHEN HE WAS HOME ALONE OR THERE COULD BE A WHOLE HOUSE FULL OF PEOPLE AND HE WOULD BE HEARING VOICES OF OTHER PEOPLE WHICH WERE NOT PART OF THE GROUP...<br>  <br>  HE HEARD THEM INTERMITTENTLY, SOMETIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT...HE WOULD WAKE  UP FROM A DEEP SLEEP ON OCCASIONS AND HEAR VOICES...SOMETIME HE WOULD HEAR MUFFLED MUSIC TOO...IT WAS BEGINNING TO DRIVE HIM NUTS..HE FINALLY WENT TO HIS DOCTOR AND EXPLAINED WHAT WAS GOING ON. THE DOCTOR GAVE HIM A THOROUGH EXAMINATION AND FOUND NOTHING NOTICEABLY WRONG...<br>  <br>  A FEW WEEKS LATER HE BEGAN TO HAVE A TOOTHACHE..AND WENT TO THE DENTIST...UPON EXAMINATION IT WAS FOUND THAT HE HAD AN OLD FILLING, WHICH WAS MADE OF SILVER MERCURY...WHICH NOT ONLY IS POISION.  BUT ALSO HAD BEEN KNOWN IN PRIOR CASES TO ACTUALLY PICK UP RADIO SIGNALS TRAVELING THROUGH THE AIR. THESE SIGNALS WERE TRANSMITTED TO THE PERSON WHO HAD THE FILLING...IT WAS LIKE LISTENING TO THE RADIO..AT TIMES, WHICH WAS EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS...THE TOOTH WAS PICKING UP A NEARBY RADIO STATION. <br>  <br>  ONCE THE DENTIST REMOVED THE FILLING, THE TRANSMISSIONS STOPPED AND NO MORE VOICES...YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE A MERCURY FILLING DO YOU?? JUST ASKING..<br>  <br>  OR THE OTHER CASE MIGHT BE...YOU ACTUALLY HAVE SOME "PARANORMAL" EVENT GOING ON...THERE ARE CLAIRAUDIENT  PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE GIFT OF RECIEVING MESSAGES FROM THE OTHER SIDE....THAT COULD VERY WELL BE THE CASE...IF IT IS THEN ACCORDING TO HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT, IT CAN BE A BLESSING OR A CURSE....GOOD LUCK !!
vouUQQzBaa	:P Perhaps you might be interested on the article below ;)<br>  <br>  <br>  In case you were wondering, "werewolf syndrome" is an unfamiliar discovered disease that is actually called hypertrichosis. It is a condition of excessive body hair that affects mostly the upper body, limbs, and face. The hair is usually thick, unwanted, and can also grow in small patches.<br>  <br>  There are different types of this condition such as congenital hypertrichosis, which is unpigmented, fine, soft hair that grows excessively and persists through life. Naevoid hypertrichosis is where an abundance of hair grows thickly in one spot or place, with normal hair surrounding it. Acquired hypertrichosis occurs on a individual after birth, unlike the other types of this disease, which usually occur before birth.<br>  <br>  Statistics show that there is a one out of a billion chance to get this disease. Also, only 19 people in the world alive today have hypertrichosis. This disease can be mild or severe, although severe cases are rare. In the severe cases, it is unmistakingly due to genetic defects. Some of these people have been featured in sideshows with names like "bearded lady," "werewolf man," and "dog-boy."<br>  <br>  You may have heard of the two brothers named Victor "Danny" Ramos and Gabriel "Larry" Ramos. These brothers have excessive hair on their face and chest, almost looking like fur. The only visible place they do not have this hair is around their eyes, mouth, and upper ears and hands. They both have worked as acrobats, and even their two cousins have this disease.<br>  <br>  This condition has also appeared in some forms of media. In the movie 'Fur: an imaginary portrait of Diane Arbus' the main character in the movie has severe hypertrichosis. Also, the film 'human nature' shows a woman with the disease. In three novels by Patricia Cornwell, her character Jean-Baptiste Chandonne suffers from this condition.<br>  <br>  To further explain this disease, it is caused by an androgen excess disorder. Androgen hair is hair follicles that respond to androgens, which allows for the rate of hair growth and heaviness of the hairs to increase. In most cases, hypertrichosis is genetic, but even certain drugs and toxins (like mercury) can cause excessive hair growth. Also, it can be caused by malnutrition or an untreated infection. For most cases, this disease is a cosmetic problem. Possible treatments could be bleaching of the hair, waxing, which is only temporary, or permanent removal called electrolysis or laser destruction of hair follicles. Electrolysis is somewhat expensive and prices range up to 25 through 150 dollars.|`|63PBNGEeaa	Id say see a strink|`|szyrw5P0aa	keep some duct tape near your dogs in case of an urge|`|hhBQe6Jdaa	i love dudes with long hair...<br>  <br>  idk maybe you just...i think you need to see a doctor bout your teeth and there ll b alright...also use deodorant and ur hair is awsome...they can cover ur ears and long hair is just cool...<br>  <br>  n if you love dogs maybe like "trisexual"<br>  <br>  idk how to spell it lolz|`|4I70V3FAaa	Yeah right.<br>  <br>  Maybe you were some sort of dog in your past life, or you just want to believe your a dog, and just convinced yourself.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think the second one is your case.|`|ZAqTOjs6aa	Sounds like your a freak. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://freaks.monstrous.com/" rel="nofollow">http://freaks.monstrous.com/</a>

You have every right to feel hurt. <br>  Happy Birthday!|`|wch6Ojd7aa	Sounds like she did do it on purpose. I`m guessing you guys had a recent quarrel and perhaps she was offended more than you think.<br>  <br>  I would give you two choices:<br>  <br>  You can choose to act childish and get revenge for her and your fathers` next birthday by doing the same, (which might start a chain reaction)...<br>  <br>  Or you can forgive her, sit her down and honestly tell her how hurt you are, maybe try and solve the bigger issues.

u7LSohRyaa	I used to think I would but then I realized he's not as liberal and caring as I thought when I reconsidered the Sermon on the Mount. There's still so much I don't know about him. Why should I leave my family and form a pretend family with a bunch of people who could dump me the minute they see me sinning? It's a trap! Better to just leave that stuff alone and stay with people you trust!|`|2k8TEiRtaa	He is talking about His disciples during His time on earth, The Nation of Israel. Because only He can offer eternal life. You don't understand what your reading. He came to save the Jews from the Law because they could not keep it. The word hate, is not literal "hate" as we see today but a translation from the original greek to english when the King James version of the Bible was translated. Neither are many words in the Bible. Like "hell", "easter" among others. I would detach myself from these things. If I were a Jew in His Time.|`|AA11229634	I love how you took the scripture out of its context. It really shows that you know what your talking about.
pqveENjUaa	Depends on what you want to believe. Atheists are going to tell you that you have a psychological disorder and should see a therapist because they believe in medicine and not religion. Christians might tell you that it's a demon in your home and that you should get a priest to exorcise the spirit because they believe in angels and demons. Some profound ghost hunters might tell you that it's just a visual imprint on the fabric of time from long ago, that lacks consciousness and is more like a hologram, playing itself over and over again because they truly believe in hauntings and want to justify them scientifically. We believe that you simply have a spirit in your house that can do you no harm unless you invite it to because we believe spirits are just bodiless, and thus emotionless, existences all around us.<br>  <br>  All of these answers are perfectly good answers. It really depends on your beliefs.<br>  <br>  You could try asking it to leave? And seeking a therapist.

A lot of the times demons and other evil forces will "dress-up" as innocent people. Little kids, old nice ladies, stuff like that. They use this to get close to your energy and then they can use it against you. Next time you see him say. I do see you, but it is your time to cross over. There are people waiting for you on the other side. It is ok to go, it will be ok. If you want to stay you can, but you can not hurt or harm any living thing in this house or out. Then go from there. If he leaves or you don't really see him anymore then he was probable human and hopefully in a better place. <br>  Also, if it has eyes, look into them. They are the window to the soul or lack there of. Also if you are seeing this ghost listen to your gut feeling. Not the first reaction, which will most likely be fear since it is something we don't fully understand. But more what you fell in your heart (technically it's the feeling right below your solar plexus but above your belly button). Just be careful and burn pure white unscented candles.|`|olopisx7aa	Um, I'd either scream bloody murder or I'd try to talk to the ghost and see if he talks back lol.

QFLtTeKEaa	Well, we have medical marijuana where I live in Oregon.  I've been to the coffee houses in Amsterdam a few times, too.<br>  <br>  We always say, "Who would you rather deal with a drunk or someone stoned?"  The point is that people don't tend to get high and beat their wives, start bar fights, or get very aggressive at all.  They just tend to eat too much and say really stupid stuff.<br>  <br>  Even if marijuana isn't legal, in a college town in Oregon, it might as well be.  Many of us wonder why spend the money putting the people in jail for something most of us do.<br>  <br>  Is it a gateway drug?  Well, if you're the type of person who when presented with one piece of chocolate runs out the door, buys a cake, and eats the whole thing, then maybe for you yes.  And, anyone who breaks a speeding law isn't going to become a wreckless driver.<br>  <br>  That said, I hate smoking pot.  I don't do it, because its boring and almost everything is more fun.  So, yeah, legalize it.  Use the hemp products like our founding father, George Washington.  But, don't be a pot head.  Addictions are sad.|`|VLcDWWwmaa	I think so. While it is not exactly productive to use it, it is not as harmful as some things that are legal (e.g. alcohol, addictive painkillers, etc.) I do think that if it is legalized, however, there should be restrictions placed on usage; for instance, no driving or operating machinery under the influence. Many people claim that pot smoke is more harmful than cigarette smoke (I don't know if it actually is), but even if that were the case, there aren't addictives in it that will cause you to smoke packs upon packs of them as people do with cigarettes. As for a comparison with alcohol, no one has EVER died of a pot overdose (many people have died from excessive drinking), and people who do marijuana become relaxed and/or happy and do not go out and start fights like drunks. Not to mention, if it were legalized and regulated by the government, that would be more funding for our communities and school systems.|`|IJoM4Q50aa	Yes. The biggest reason is because our law enforcement is wasting there time arresting pot heads when they could be out there arresting Real drug dealers, robbers, murders and rapists. Not to mention how much more room there would be in jails and prisons for the ones that need to be there. The only reason it is illegal is because the government can't find a way to tax the sale of it. There afraid they are  losing all the money. But, there losing way more paying cops to arrest them, court costs and jail time.|`|cUy4cFnzaa	helltothemotherfuckingno<br>  <br>  if peeps want it bad enough they can risk the law, otherwise, it's a poopy product and makes hot sex hard bodies into flabs of gross!|`|4INE794zaa	Well, there are two ways you can look at it. <br>  <br>  On one hand, if it does become legal, then the government will be able to tax it, and make money off of it. The prison population will be cut down, as many are there for ridiculous drug offences. <br>  On the other hand, it will need to be government regulated, prices, where to sell it, how it can be marketed. No doubt corporations manufacturing it will stick a bunch of added crappola to make it more addictive, more potent, etc. More laws will need to be implemented to keep people from driving while stoned.  ( There should be more laws now concerning driving under the influence) People will still steal, and hurt others, to get the money to purchase it. <br>  <br>  Perhaps the US should do as we have in Canada. Decriminalize amounts under 28.35 grams/1 ounce. Amounts that can only be deemed personal use, not for the purposes of trafficking. Then, your jails would no be so full.|`|wigtXCBTaa	NEVER, unless it's in California|`|73b2c46bf81e2be1d93af950383a79e8aa	I would have agreed back in the day - but now I gotta say "no".<br>  <br>  I would like to see it de-criminalized - and palces for people with addictions get cheap or free drugs - <br>  <br>  They tried this Switzerland and it worked really well - what street dealer can compete with "free" - although you have to go 'sign-up' and stay there while you took your drugs - but it would take the 'kick' out the drugs by shining a theraputic light on em.<br>  <br>  If pot simply gets legalized and is sold for taz profits - your gonna see a lot trouble from it.<br>  <br>  You will see horrible bad car accidents (death) , kids going to other worse drugs - heroin, crack, booze, coke, etc...<br>  you will lives being hurt by a druggy culture which feel empowered to be blatant about it.<br>  <br>  You will see innocent kids like 3rd graders finding themselves struggling with 'stoner' parents -<br>  <br>  So I gotta say - "decriminalize" yes - but NOT open it up for the legal status of ciggarettes - <br>  <br>  keep it really on the low-down - it would just be better.|`|SBjV8GlFaa	I don't think so! They are making smoking cigarettes illegal everywhere, so why should pot smokers get to smoke dope, when the cig companies are making billions, and can't even smoke them anywhere, anymore. Very confusing issue.|`|hii5wweQaa	of coarse prohibition dose not work never has never will|`|Xtqq71KGaa	yes.
bR4BgFLlaa	Yes, eventually  but maybe not in our life times. Public opinion is changing all the time towards marijuana and when mass public opinion changes legislation follows eventually. That said there is too much money to be made from other synthetic drugs in the drug market for a natural drug like marijuana to be palatable to the ever powerful drug companies...
eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	As I've said elsewhere:<br>  <br>  Everything comes from somewhere, in my opinion... But I don't think Traditional Vampires (the kind you see in most books and movies) exist as they are portrayed, if at all. Maybe they do or did at some point, I don't think anyone can know for sure, but even if it were so then I doubt you're going to find any. I would think that a being like that relies on keeping its existence secret.<br>  <br>  Either way, there are Modern Vampires, which would be people that need to feed off others in order to stay healthy and/or feel good. They for sure exist, and can be anyone. :] I've been around the community for about five or six years now, and there's all sorts of people there... good and not-so-good.

We know ourselves better than anybody (at least for most of us), so we should be the only ones that can decide what things we should give up.<br>  <br>  <br>  That's how the brainwashing begins, too. Next they'll be telling people these things are a sin.|`|2d2ZuimCaa	Can you explain to me what lent is and where it is in the Bible ? Isaiah 64:6 " But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away." Psalm 39:5 ' Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity."|`|CrNrqvQFaa	I'm not Catholic, but I disagree. A sacrifice meant to honor the deity you believe in should be a more personal choice and thusly mean more. <br>  <br>  Also, it's very circumstantial. For instance, maybe someone is a single parent and thus the sole breadwinner and works at a job that requires s/he be on the computer alot? Asking them to sacrifice that for lent would mean they would probably get fired and would throw the family in peril.<br>  <br>  Besides, while some people overdue it and we got along before cell phones and laptops and computers...they are incredibly useful now. And you never know in this day and age when a cell phone might save your, or someone else's life.|`|AA11796124	<<What do you think about being told what to give up for lent?>><br>  <br>  Not a bad idea. Haven't you noticed all the people on YA posting questions looking for ideas on what to give up for Lent?<br>  With those people in mind, it's not wrong for clergymen to offer suggestions on what to give up for Lent.<br>  <br>  <br>  <<What do you think about the Roman Catholic church asking people to give up their gadgets (texting, phones, laptops,..) for lent?>><br>  <br>  And yet another has taken things out of context. The bishops in question were not asking people to stop using their gadgets altogether. What they SPECIFICALLY asked was the abstinence of "TECHNOLOGY FOR PLEASURE". The listing of the various gadgets was merely for the sake of giving examples.<br>  <br>  I mean, let's be real. No one would, or could, give up using all those gadgets for 40 days. However, it is entirely within the realm of everyone's ability to pick at least one of those gdgets listed and stop using it for recreation for the duration of Lent.|`|96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	The best thing to give up is religious delusions an superstitions dear...|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Here's a suggestion: Don't give up your phone or your laptop ... just give up!

There are a lot of translation companies that can help you. I have a lot of experience in translation of personal documents including Polish, but it's a little hard to give you advice since I do not know what exactly you might want to know. <br>  <br>  Process itself is rather simple: you can give it to a translation company or do it your self if you can. If you need it certified then the company would certify their translation. If you do it yourself you would have to certify it yourself.

What is it?<br>  <br>  R2R: “Mankind is naturally going to Hell when they die, because they are not perfect like God is, but God made a way for people to go to Heaven instead!”<br>  <br>  Me: (I looked over at a friend behind me who was visiting.  He translated for me):<br>  <br>  Richard (my visiting friend): “What they said was, that if you believe what they believe, you will not be tortured in Hell forever.”<br>  <br>  Me: “Oh, OK- I wasn’t sure – thanks!”<br>  <br>  A cold breeze came through the house as I turned back to the visitors at my door.  The sky was beginning to darken, showing the first signs of night – I shuddered.<br>  <br>  Me: "Boy! I don't want to be tortured at all! What is it that I have to believe?!?!"<br>  <br>  R2R: "It's really simple. You have to believe that you are unacceptable because this book (The 1611 KJV Bible) says so - and it doesn't matter whether you're good or bad, 'cause A really, really, really big and powerful being invented you - and since you are not as big or as powerful, you are unacceptable.  You are bad because your great, great, great, great, great... Grandparents disobeyed this big, big, being – you see, friend, you inherited their sin!” (smile)<br>  Me: “Wow! Do tell me more about this being!”<br>  <br>  R2R: “I’m glad you axed!  This being is composed of three parts and these three parts are one being and one of these beings (the one that is most important to us - became a man - Jesus, like you, over 2,000 years ago and walked on water and turned perfectly good water into an adult beverage, for a party!<br>  <br>  This was a mere man, but at the same time, this book says that the "fullness of the Godhead was in him...  So he was inextricably GOD also.  Before Jesus (God), men had to kill animals that had no blemishes on them to atone for their sins, and burn them on an altar, but since Jesus was sinless and perfect, God killed him for a final sacrifice, so that all we had to do from that point on was simply believe!"<br>  <br>  Me: “This story is incredible, I must say!  But honestly, I think that I’d rather make animal sacrifices still, than force my brain to believe something so silly!”<br>  <br>  R2R: “Wait! There’s more.  You have to turn away from your evil ways - even though you are not judged because you're evil, but by your faith instead.  If you are evil, it means that you have no faith, if you have faith, you will not desire evil - and you have to read this book as much as possible and let it magically transform you, as the third part of God, the Holy Ghost, reveals the truth of it to you.”<br>  <br>  Me: “How do you expect me to believe all this stuff?  In fact, why would anyone believe it? Of course no one wants to go to Hell, but am I expected to believe something before I know it to be true?”<br>  <br>  R2R: “That’s the beauty of the transforming power of the Holy Spirit!  You first believe, like a child – by faith!  You ask the second part of the threefold God (Jesus) to come into your heart and save you, because you do not want to perish, because you are evil.  If you do this, and really try to believe it – and read this book and pray to God, eventually your belief will become knowledge, and you will come to KNOW that it is true!”<br>  <br>  Me: “I’m truly sorry, but I prefer NOT to brainwash myself into believing things just because I may be afraid of an ancient story that says I will go to Hell if I do not.”<br>  R2R: “If you do not believe this book, you will be choosing to go to Hell, where you'll be tortured by the ruler of all evil – Satan - forever!<br>  <br>  He will torture you because God will allow him to, like he did Job. Or Maybe the Devil just likes to torture people forever, either way,<br>  <br>  If you believe like we do, you get love, peace, healing, every desire fulfilled, streets of gold, mansions, heaven, happiness forever!<br>  <br>  But, if you do not believe like we do, you get tortured, you will gnash your teeth, you will be surrounded by flames that never go out, you will be alone, there will be horror, nightmares, and Hell!!!!!<br>  <br>  So as you can see, it's really a super easy choice, isn't it?  Only a fool would reject such an offer!"<br>  <br>  Me: "So you hold these beliefs strongly?"<br>  <br>  R2R: “Honestly, we do not consider these beliefs – we consider them facts.  My friend, we know all this to be truth."<br>  <br>  Me: “Then count me among the fools.  Your claims are not only ridiculous, but also insulting to every fiber of decency and integrity and common sense in my being!<br>  <br>  Any God – whether he made me or not – who demands anything of me (especially wholly unreasonable beliefs)   -  any self-proclaimed “Christ” whose only alternative to self-imposed brainwashing is an eternity of torture is not worthy of even a glance from me in their general direction.  <br>  <br>  With all due re|`|jTFHNLS7aa	Get yourself and your parents checked by a Psychiatrist.

FGcwxZz0aa	Jesus sacrifice gave mankind a means of forgivness of our sins so that we can receive eternal life. Limbo is theological speculation and not doctrine. We pray that God will be merciful to children who die without baptism. <br>  <br>  The Church from the beginning has practiced the Baptism of children. The reasons are very clear in Scriptures.<br>  <br>  (Joh 3:5 DRB) Jesus answered: Amen, amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.<br>  <br>  To the first Christians that baptized their children it was understood by them that Baptism is the doorway to salvation. St. Peter said the following:<br>  <br>  (1Pe 3:18 DRB) Because Christ also died once for our sins, the just for the unjust: that he might offer us to God, being put to death indeed in the flesh, but enlivened in the spirit,<br>  <br>  (1Pe 3:19 DRB) In which also coming he preached to those spirits that were in prison:<br>  <br>  (1Pe 3:20 DRB) Which had been some time incredulous, when they waited for the patience of God in the days of Noe, when the ark was a building: wherein a few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water.<br>  <br>  (1Pe 3:21 DRB) Whereunto baptism, being of the like form, now saveth you also: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but, the examination of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  The effects of Baptism are the regeneration of the soul (born again), eradication of original sin and actual sin and its effects on the soul. A baby does not have actual sin but does have original sin. Through Baptism we become members of the Body of Christ, of which St. Paul says the following:<br>  <br>  (2Co 5:17 DRB) If then any be in Christ a new creature, the old things are passed away. Behold all things are made new.<br>  <br>  (1Co 3:16 DRB) Know you not that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?<br>  <br>  Baptism is the sacramental doorway into the Church: <br>  <br>  (Mat 28:19 DRB) Going therefore, teach ye all nations: baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.<br>  <br>  The Bible teaches that everyone should be Baptized:<br>  <br>  (Act 2:38 DRB) But Peter said to them: Do penance: and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins. And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br>  <br>  (Act 2:39 DRB) For the promise is to you and to your children and to all that are far off, whomsoever the Lord our God shall call.<br>  <br>  (Act 2:40 DRB) And with very many other words did he testify and exhort them, saying: Save yourselves from this perverse generation.<br>  <br>  (Act 2:41 DRB) They therefore that received his word were baptized: and there were added in that day about three thousand souls.<br>  <br>  (Act 2:42 DRB) And they were persevering in the doctrine of the apostles and in the communication of the breaking of bread and in prayers.<br>  <br>  St. Peter at Pentecost said to the adults to repent but did not exclude children from Baptism, instead saying that everyone should receive the Holy Spirit not just those of age to repent. He said it is “to you and to your children”. That is why people in the early Church brought even their smallest children to be baptized as do parents today. <br>  <br>  There is no necessity to repent for children to be Baptized according to Scriptures. The command to repent is not binding on infants nor to mentally incapacitated people as the intent of repentance is not to exclude those incapable of such an act. They are not to be condemned because of their lack of ability to repent. Certainly the same understanding should apply as we understand St. Paul’s statement in 2 Thessalonians 3:10 where St. Paul says that someone who does not work does not eat. Are we to deny children or the mentally handicapped sustenance? Certainly they should not, nor should they be denied eternal life.<br>  <br>  The Old Testament required circumcision at eight days old as a sign of the covenant of God. The child had no knowledge of why he was being circumcised yet the parents brought the son to the synagogue to have this done. God accepted the child into the covenant for what the parents had done just as He accepts the Baptism when the parents present their child to be baptized. The Scriptures tell us clearly that Baptism replaced circumcision:<br>  <br>  (Col 2:11 DRB) In whom also you are circumcised with circumcision not made by hand in despoiling of the body of the flesh: but in the circumcision of Christ.<br>  <br>  (Col 2:12 DRB) Buried with him in baptism: in whom also you are risen again by the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him up from the dead.<br>  <br>  We must remember what Christ said when there were those who attempted to forbid the children from coming to Him:<br>  <br>  (Luk 18:15 DRB) And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them. Which when the disciples saw, they rebuked them.<br>  <br>  (Luk 18:16 DRB) But Jesus, calling them together, said: Suffer children to come to me and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.<br>  <br>  (Luk 18:17 DRB) Amen, I say to you: Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a child shall not enter into it.<br>  <br>  Can there be any doubt by a proper understanding of Scripture that children should be baptized? Certainly a complete understanding of the Scriptural verses shows clearly that children have the same need for Baptism as adults and that they should not be held away from this act by their parents or the Church lest they put the child in grave danger and the parents and/or Church are disobedient to the spirit of the teaching of Jesus and the apostles.<br>  <br>  In Christ <br>  Fr. Joseph|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	I don't believe in Baptizing babies.  I believe you should be baptized when you are old enough to make your own choices about what you believe and I believe that is what is Bibically correct. I have never seen the word 'limbo' in the Bible and don't believe in that either.|`|cdc288ac537ecf1efe5ace9f795fe44aaa	You are wrong. Jesus our Great Almighty God and Saviour died so that we would have chance to go to Heaven Before that only Enoch and Prophet Elijjah only were sent  to Heaven by a chariot of Fire. The Book of 1 Peter said Jesus descended to Hell to release souls to Heaven even when him hid divinity and humanity laid dead on the cross<br>  What a Miracle.<br>  Baptism in the name of The Father., The Son and the Holy Spirit. As Jesus said to the priest Nichcodeamus unless a man is born again in the spirit , he cannot enter the kingdom of Heaven<br>  The Roman Catholic does believe in the state of Limbo(purgatory)<br>  In the Gospel of Joh and in the Passion of the Jesus Christ He said to his Mother Look i made all things new. He was refering to the salvation of the human race through baptism. that does not mean we cannot sin<br>  The Cathecism of the Roman Catholic Church tell us that while people are destined by God to do his will , they have a right to accept or reject, This shows how much freewill is determinedd for a person's choice<br>  The Roman Catholic Church accepts the state of Limbo|`|1aa8b20a9151f0263c0e250dfc8c3448aa	Just another ritual...|`|zefFTf8Aaa	The Baptism of infants <br>  <br>  1250 Born with a fallen human nature and tainted by original sin, children also have need of the new birth in Baptism to be freed from the power of darkness and brought into the realm of the freedom of the children of God, to which all men are called.50 The sheer gratuitousness of the grace of salvation is particularly manifest in infant Baptism. The Church and the parents would deny a child the priceless grace of becoming a child of God were they not to confer Baptism shortly after birth.51 <br>  <br>  1251 Christian parents will recognize that this practice also accords with their role as nurturers of the life that God has entrusted to them.52 <br>  <br>  1252 The practice of infant Baptism is an immemorial tradition of the Church. There is explicit testimony to this practice from the second century on, and it is quite possible that, from the beginning of the apostolic preaching, when whole "households" received baptism, infants may also have been baptized.53|`|wxBFZ41Taa	No, we are never told that the death of Christ "erased" original sin, nor was that ever taught by the Apostles.<br>  <br>  Sin caused a permanent chasm between us and God. It separated us from God and nothing we can do will change that.  Jesus Christ died on the cross as the perfect sacrifice for us, and through he we can cross the chasm. His sacrifice gives us the grace to approach God and not go to hell as we deserve. But sin still exists, it can still lead us to eternal death. <br>  <br>  So we baptize our babies, as did the early Church, to remove the stain of original sin and join our babies to the new covenant of God. Just as the infant Jewish boys were circumcised as an outward sign that they were joined the God's covenant, so our Christian babies are baptized to join them to the new covenant. St. Paul tells us that baptism replaces circumcision...and who was cirucmcised...babies!|`|mNyhRGowaa	"We" do not baptize infants. This is a choice made by a person that is at their age of accountability. The baptizing of infants is a showy money making product that the catholic church has been selling for years.|`|P5rczL0Saa	Baptism has nothing to do with salvation. Baptism is an outward expression of an inward change.   Jesus PAID for all our sins, past, present and future. It is up to us, however, to REPENT of our sins so they can be forgiven.  Infant baptism is not Scriptural.<br>  It is not what we do, but what He has done that saves us. If it is what we do (baptism) then why would Jesus have had to die at all?   Nothing we can do to save ourselves!|`|xI48JiUUaa	Because He ordered baptize to all persons (babies, childs, adults, women, men, old people).<br>  <br>  The Baptism is in order join to the Church, not only to forgive the sins|`|jrqXRqqCaa	baptismal is one of the sacrament of becoming a christian.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Because it is 'man' that does what is NOT Biblical in the first place!!

Catholics NEVER said such a thing. <br>  <br>  2) The Church never recognized Limbo. It was speculative theology, an attempt at confjecturing about something we had no revelation or Faith belief about, What happens to unbaptized babies.<br>  <br>  3) Infant Baptism, like Protestant Original Sin, is another huge change. For 1600 years EVERYBODY baptized babies. POPE Luther handed down his doctrine about Scripture and Sacraments etc. and the world said "Sure, Whatever !!!".<br>  <br>  <br>  Become a Catholic, avoid the confusion.|`|HGadAqG9aa	i dont know. i think its because the catholic church thinks that it represents real baptism, but it doesnt mean anything because the child being baptized is unaware of the whole ceremony.

6ec6afa27ccfe7badb1528fec2817bfcaa	I don't really remember the details in the donkey skin story (and I am too lazy to look it up).. but to get you started:<br>  <br>  Cinderella was pretty submissive. She did not do anything to change her situation, and had to wait for a rescuer (the fairy) to create some miracle by which she finally got  rescued (once more, by the prince)from her fate in the kitchen. Even during the research by the prince's servants (who fits the glass shoe??) she did not come forward straightaway.<br>  <br>  The moral was: "be good and good will be done to you". The first "good" here being submissive, do chores for others, and not step forward to claim your rights, which was supposed to be "right" for females: the sisters who did stand up for their needs were supposed to be "bad".

Vy3QlUA9aa	I don't believe in Reward and Punishment based religion.  Your virtues should be altruistic. You must be righteous just for righteousness sake, not expecting any reward such as inheriting the earth.  Who cares about inheriting the earth.  That is the wrong motive.|`|p5cglKf0aa	FIRST QUESTION<br>  <br>  What wisdom does it spring from, Adam (Upon whom be peace) being expelled from Paradise and some of mankind, the sons of Adam, being sent to Hell?<br>  <br>  T h e A n s w e r : The wisdom of it concerns the charging of duties; Adam was sent charged with such a duty that the unfolding of all mankind’s spiritual progress and the revealing of all mankind’s potentialities and man’s essential nature being a comprehensive mirror to all the Divine Names, are the results of it. If Adam had remained in Paradise, his rank would have been fixed like that of the angels; man’s potentialities would not have unfolded. In any case, the angels, whose rank is fixed, are numerous, and there is no need for man to perform that sort of worship. Indeed, since Divine wisdom required a realm of responsibility appropriate to the potentialities of man, who would traverse infinite degrees, he was expelled from Paradise for his well-known sin - sin being the requirement of man’s nature and contrary to that of the angels. That is to say, just as Adam being expelled from Paradise was pure wisdom and pure mercy, so too is it just and right that the unbelievers should be sent to Hell.<br>  <br>  <br>  As is mentioned in the Third Indication in the Tenth Word, the unbeliever only committed one sin in a short life, but within the sin was infinite wrongdoing. For unbelief is an insult to the whole universe, it reduces the value of all beings, it denies the testimony to Divine Unity of a11 creatures, and is contempt towards the Divine Names the manifestations of which are to be seen in the mirrors of beings. Therefore, in order to avenge the rights of beings on the unbeliever, the beings' monarch, the All-Compelling One of Glory, casts the unbelievers into Hell, and this is pure right and justice. For an infinite crime demands infinite punishment.<br>  <br>  <br>  SECOND QUESTION<br>  <br>  Why are devils created? Almighty God created Satan and evils; what is the wisdom in it? Isn't the creation of evil, evil, and the creation of bad, bad?<br>  <br>  T h e A n s w e r :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2943&t=The+Twelfth+Letter" rel="nofollow">http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2943&...</a>|`|xLKPKgZXaa	Read the book of Revelation chapter 21.

History is littered with the crimes and atrocities committed by Christianity. Sounds more likely that Christianity has numbered its own days by its own evil actions. <br>  <br>  And it does not say the Christians will inherit the earth, it says the meek. Christians are not meek, they are vicious murderers, torturers, rapists, stone people to death, steal peoples property and lands, burn people alive, give small pox infected blankets to people, cause millions to suffer from unwanted pregnancies, spread aids, etc etc etc. The list of atrocities is endless. And you think you are going to be saved because you are a Christian.|`|AA11297267	The hebrews, whose scripture the old testament is, didn't have any concept of an afterlife.  Their "heaven" was simply where god was, and they didn't have "hell."  Their god Jehovah was their protector in THIS life, not in any afterlife.  When you understand that, the Psalm makes perfect sense, because they expected their god (and they did consider him just one of many gods, he was simply *their* god) to help them "possess the earth" right then and there -- no waiting for an afterlife.<br>  <br>  The concept of an afterlife and the punishment/reward of heaven or hell in that afterlife is entirely christian, and was added onto hebrew belief.  So the psalm makes no sense in that context -- because it wasn't written in that context, but in the context of the here and now.<br>  <br>  Of course, it's all just a fairy tale...but it makes more sense when you understand the context of the fairy tale :)<br>  <br>  Peace.

07TvvktDaa	I myself being a half-Filipino, half-Thai (Filipino father and Thai mother), and having lived in both countries, this is what I can say:<br>  <br>  Yes. If you marry a Thai woman, you have to support her family too (just like a Filipina). Although this is not mandatory, it is usually expected of the children to support their aged parents when they're grown up. This is part of the asian culture in general. Also, in the Philippines or Thailand, there is no such thing as home-for-the-elderly (unlike in the US or Canada) where retired or old-people can be entrusted to be taken care of. So parents are much on their own when they become very old, unless the children will provide support for them.<br>  <br>  Thai women are more materialistic. If a neighbor shows-off a new TV-set or nice pieces jewelry, the Thai woman usually nudges her husband to buy the same things for her too (as what the neighbor has).<br>  <br>  For a Thai woman, financial matters takes a higher priority than the affairs of the heart. If she has to choose between a handsome/dashing (but poor) suitor or an ugly/beer-bellied (but rich) suitor, she usually chooses the second one. Some people here might wrongly judge that she is only after the money. But the fact is that she's actually sacrificing her own heart and feelings in exchange of providing better financial future for her family left behind, something that a Filipina or other asian woman wouldn't dare to take.|`|aMkWajC7aa	i hve no idea about thai women whats their culture but for filipino women yes its their culture to help their parents if they can but if you cant then its jst ok, it depends on how you tell your husband and if your husband agree on that...not all filipino parents ask support from their married children, if their children wants to support them then its fine and that would be great and be appreciated but if they will not they will not force you...you can give if you have but u cant give if you dont have its like that.....hehehhehe|`|IgFXv2Tfaa	nothing they are all beautiful whilst young|`|94c0ec021388b26b975de66b616f1c70aa	Now that is a good question and you may be too young for the answer!|`|hii5wweQaa	about twenty bucks

The term was coined by a French psychic researcher, émile Boirac (1851–1917) in his book "L'Avenir des sciences psychiques" ("The Future of Psychic Sciences"), which expanded upon an essay he wrote while an undergraduate. The experience of déjà vu is usually accompanied by a compelling sense of familiarity, and also a sense of "eeriness," "strangeness," or "weirdness," The "previous" experience is most frequently attributed to real life, although in some cases there is a firm sense that the experience "genuinely happened" in the past.<br>  <br>  The experience of déjà vu seems to be quite common among adults and children alike; in formal studies, 70% of people report having experienced it at least once.[citation needed] References to the experience of déjà vu are also found in literature of the past,[1] indicating it is not a new phenomenon. It has been extremely difficult to evoke the déjà vu experience in laboratory settings, therefore making it a subject of few empirical studies.

I know teens who drink and smoke regularly and i know teens who write worship songs and plan open mic nights at church. I know teen parents and I know foster kids. There's so much diversity..i love the weahe here usually because we have awesome snow right now, just like the day I was born, yet we also have hot summers, breezy autumns and stormy springs. <br>  Depending on the school you go to, everything can be completely different, from dress code to curriculum. Different schools have different schedules and get different days off. Different schools have different relationships with each other. Most schools that i know of try to encourage some type of uniform, especially in the last few years. In new York and California, they have something called Regents, which are standard exams, for each subject - physics, chemistry, living environment, earth science, english, math A, math B, global history, u.s. history - and the high school diplomas are as follows: regents diploma, advanced regents diploma, advanced regents diploma with honors(if your average on all of the regents you took is 90 or higher).

It permeates the world in which we live. (Ephesians 2:1-3) However, Jehovah God will not allow his clean worship to be corrupted. Christian publications, meetings, assemblies, and conventions give us timely warnings against unrighteous conduct. We receive sound Scriptural help to “cling to what is good” in God’s eyes. (Romans 12:9) As an organization, therefore, Jehovah’s Witnesses are striving to be clean, virtuous. But what about us as individuals? Indeed, are you pursuing virtue?<br>  2 Virtue is moral excellence, goodness, right action and thinking. It is not a passive quality but an active, positive one. Virtue involves more than avoiding sin; it means pursuing what is good. (1?Timothy 6:11) The apostle Peter exhorted fellow Christians: “Supply to your faith virtue.” How? By “contributing in response [to God’s precious promises] all earnest effort.” (2?Peter 1:5) Because of our sinful nature, it takes real effort to remain virtuous. Yet, God-fearing individuals of the past have done so, even in the face of immense obstacles.<br>  He Pursued Virtue<br>  3 The Scriptures contain many accounts of those who pursued virtue. For instance, consider virtuous Hezekiah. His father, King Ahaz of Judah, evidently worshiped Molech. “Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and for sixteen years he reigned in Jerusalem; and he did not do what was right in the eyes of Jehovah his God like David his forefather. And he went walking in the way of the kings of Israel, and even his own son he made pass through the fire, according to the detestable things of the nations whom Jehovah drove out because of the sons of Israel. And he kept sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places and upon the hills and under every luxuriant tree.” (2?Kings 16:2-4) Some claim that ‘passing through the fire’ signified some sort of purification ritual and not human sacrifice. However, the book Molech—A God of Human Sacrifice in the Old Testament, by John Day, observes: “There is evidence in classical and Punic [Carthaginian] sources, as well as archaeological evidence, for the existence of human sacrifice .?.?. in the Canaanite world, and so there is no reason to doubt the Old Testament allusions [to human sacrifice].” Furthermore, 2?Chronicles 28:3 specifically says that Ahaz “proceeded to burn up his sons in the fire.” (Compare Deuteronomy 12:31; Psalm 106:37, 38.) What wicked acts!<br>  4 How did Hezekiah fare in this vice-filled environment? The 119th Psalm is of interest, for some believe that Hezekiah composed it, doing this while still a prince. (Psalm 119:46, 99, 100) So his circumstances may be indicated by the words: “Even princes have sat; against me they have spoken with one another. As for your servant, he concerns himself with your regulations. My soul has been sleepless from grief.” (Psalm 119:23, 28) Surrounded by practicers of false religion, Hezekiah may have become an object of scorn among members of the royal court, so much so that sleep was difficult. Yet, he pursued virtue, in time became king, and “continued to do what was right in Jehovah’s eyes .?.?. In Jehovah the God of Israel he trusted.”—2?Kings 18:1-5.<br>  They Remained Virtuous<br>  5 Also exemplary in virtue were Daniel and his three Hebrew companions, named Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. They were forcibly taken from their homeland and exiled to Babylon. The four youths were given Babylonian names—Belteshazzar, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. They were offered “the delicacies of the king,” including foods forbidden by God’s Law. Moreover, they were compelled to undergo a three-year training course related to “the writing and the tongue of the Chaldeans.” This involved more than simply learning another language, for it is likely that the term “Chaldeans” here designates the learned class. Thus, these Hebrew youths were exposed to warped Babylonian teachings.—Daniel?1:1-7.<br>  6 In spite of enormous pressures to conform, Daniel and his three companions chose virtue over vice. Daniel 1:21 says: “Daniel continued on until the first year of Cyrus the king.” Yes, Daniel “continued on” as a virtuous servant of Jehovah for over 80 years—through the rise and fall of several powerful kings. He remained faithful to God despite the intrigues and plots of corrupt government officials and the sexual vice permeating Babylonian religion. Daniel kept on pursuing virtue.<br>  7 We can learn much from God-fearing Daniel and his companions. They pursued virtue and refused to be assimilated into Babylonian culture. Though given Babylonian names, they never lost their identity as Jehovah’s servants. Why, some 70 years later, the Babylonian king addressed Daniel by his Hebrew name! (Daniel 5:13) Throughout his long life, Daniel refused to compromise even in small matters. As a young person, he had “deter|`|wM7pprr1aa	Both, as well as intellectual honesty.|`|11bc4cae873dd3e9feff6c81fac05c17aa	Neither self-restraint, nor diversity, nor selective tolerance.

Yes, it is normal and natural to feel attracted to the man you're planning on marrying.  In fact, I'd say it is recommended.<br>  <br>  2.  I don't know of anything you can do that makes it okay to be alone with a non-mehram before nikkah.  I might be wrong, but...<br>  <br>  3.  In your case, since your feelings are obviously strong, I would recommend that you don't spend any more alone time with your intended.  You don't want to commit zina.  You'll feel better about everything if you don't.  Trust me.<br>  <br>  4.  You should not seduce your intended.  Not only are you sinning, but you're leading him to sin also.  Do you want him to be punished in the afterlife because you couldn't control yourself?<br>  <br>  5.  Will he satisfy himself elsewhere?  I don't know your intended.  But I can tell you, mine wouldn't.  He would wait a year for me, I know it.  And I would wait for him.  When you love someone it's more than carnal desires, and no one else would suffice.  So if your man is trustworthy, then trust him, and see if you can't hasten the day of your nikkah.<br>  <br>  Mabrook on your engagement and good luck with your marriage.

You dont need to seduce him he has already agreed to marry you, so he must like you and desire you already. 9 months is gone in the blink of an eye and you both will be so happy that you waited.|`|aYi8oEkJaa	i understand that you just want to be with him.. it natural like you said. <br>  <br>  you told that he has seriously repented right? .. perhaps that is why he does not want to touch you.

Please don't seduce him, you both would be sinning if you engaged in intercourse.

Would u really want your future husband to go hell?<br>  <br>  Be patient, for allah is with the patient...<br>  <br>  Peace|`|gndbaRgaaa	I am not going to judge you<br>  Listen to him, If he wants to wait be glad.

Patience is the key sister|`|ou20w5sCaa	Bismillahi Rahmani Rahim<br>  <br>  Salaam Alaikum wa Rahmatullah<br>  <br>  First of all, there is no such thing as "engagement" in Islam.  If you have not done the wedding, then you are not permitted to touch or be alone together.  In a marriage, the wedding consists of the permission of the girl's father (or other guardian if the father is deceased), the agreement of the man and the woman, two adult male witnesses, the man giving the woman a mahr (marriage gift), and announcing the marriage.  Only if this has been done are you married.  Reading surat al-Fatihah has no effect on you and does not give you the permission to be together.<br>  <br>  I would STRONGLY advise that you immediately do your marriage and then you are permitted to touch, kiss, or be intimate if you want.  You can put off the wedding banquet, the walima, to such time as you both agree.  I'm sure he has feelings for you as you do for him, and asking you to put off acting on those feelings for almost another year is foolish and will cause both of you emotional harm.  <br>  <br>  Talk to your parents and tell them that you wish to marry now, and if it is not possible to do the walima now you can put it off.  InshAllah they will understand that you wish to be able to have a halaal relationship with your intended, and this is the only way for it to come about.  And Allah knows best.<br>  <br>  Fi Aman Allah,<br>  <br>  Nancy Umm Abdel Hamid

h6NUE6VTaa	Ruling on perfumes containing alcohol <br>  assalum Alalykum<br>  I would like to ask you if wearing perfume such as CK Eternity, or Aramis which contains Alchol SD, or Alchol denat. Thanks Brother.<br>  Assalum Alaykum<br>  <br>  Praise be to Allaah.<br>  We need to talk at length about the issue of perfumes that are said to contain cologne or alcohol. If the percentage of alcohol is very little, we say that it does not matter, and a person may use them without any concern, such as if the alcohol content is 5% or less. This does not matter.<br>  If the percentage of alcohol is very high, so that you can detect it, then it is better not to use it except where it is necessary, such as for sterilizing wounds and the like.<br>  In cases where it is not necessary, it is better not to use it, but we do not say that it is haram. The most we can say is that this high alcohol content is an intoxicant, and no doubt consuming intoxicants is haram according to the texts of Islam and the consensus of the scholars, but is using it in ways other than drinking it permissible? This is open to speculation, but to be on the safe side we should not use it. If you say that it is open to speculation because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, al-ansaab [animals that are sacrificed on stone altars for idols], and al-azlaam [arrows for seeking luck or decision], are an abomination of Shaytaan’s handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful. Shaytaan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allaah and from al-salaah (the prayer). So will you not then abstain?” [al-Ma’idah 5:90-91], then we look at the general meaning of the phrase So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination), and say that alcohol should be avoided in all cases, whether it is drunk or applied to the skin, or used in some other way. If we look at the reason why, Allaah says, “Shaytaan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allaah and from al-salaah (the prayer). So will you not then abstain?” We may understand this to mean that only drinking it is forbidden, because applying it to the skin does not lead to that (enmity and hatred, etc.). So, in conclusion, we say that if the percentange of alcohol in this perfume is low, there is no need to worry about using it, but if it is high, then it is better to avoid it unless it is for a need, such as sterilizing wounds and the like.<br>  Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 24<br>  <a href="http://www.islamqa.com/en/ref/1365/perfume%20alcohol" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamqa.com/en/ref/1365/perfu...</a>|`|QcviYozHaa	Peace..<br>  <br>  Yes Unfortunately it is because its an intoxicant...The prophet said that even if 1 drop of alcohol went on ur cloths u must wash it straight away..He even said if 1 drop of alcohol came onto ur skin your prayer wouldnt be accepted until that 1 drop is out of ur body....(But if alcohol comes by mistake and u did not know then that is a different situation and allah is all forgiving)...<br>  <br>  Some people "think" that u can wear it because they arent drinking it and alcohol is only forbidden because of drinking and losing control of oneself.

TwcAQPupaa	My husband is the Elder's quorum president and he was called to go and help give blessings to a family who was sick.  It was a great opportunity for me to sit down with the kids and explain the importance of having the priesthood in our home and how blessed we are that daddy is worthy to hold the priesthood and magnify his calling.  I don't know how much they understood, as they are very young, but I felt it was important.

77b2610047fd4e5f740d75e96c9a88a2aa	Here's the wiki link: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_Services" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitaria...</a><br>  <br>  And here's all the links you get if you search it: <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=UTF-8&fr=slv8-hptb7&p=lds+humanitarian+services&SpellState=n-4165770622_q-c85U4YI1IvcGoKu6e2%2FlYQAAAA%40%40&fr2=sp-qrw-corr-top">http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=UTF-8&...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  well trav...come on.  This info is out there for everyone.  Straight from wiki, here is a list of things the church provides for non-Mormons  (notice that the church has donated halaal meals):<br>  Emergency Response is the part of the LDS Church’s humanitarian efforts of which most people are aware. Funds and supplies in this area are used to help victims of natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, tornadoes, and hurricanes, as well as other disasters such as wars or political unrest. Supplies in this area are gathered and stored before a crisis so supplies can be sent literally within hours of an emergency. Volunteers are also on call so if they are needed they can be reached and organized within a few hours. The LDS Church is renowned for its ability to organize its members in various regions of the world to respond to emergency and facilitate distributing goods.[2] <br>  Wheelchair Distribution is another program of the LDS Church crucial to helping those in need. Studies estimate that only one percent of the disabled in the world have wheelchairs. For the rest, being without a wheelchair means for adults that they can not provide for themselves or their families, and for children it often means not being able to attend school. By providing wheelchairs to those in need, the Church hopes to help people become more self-reliant which is an important tenant of LDS beliefs.[3] <br>  The Clean Water Service provides clean water and wells to people who otherwise would most likely contract deadly diseases because of the dirty water. Studies estimate that nearly 3 million people, mostly children, die each year from diseases related to unsanitary water.[4] <br>  The Neonatal Resuscitation program sends doctors and volunteers to areas where infant mortality rate is high. They are able to teach people in the area how to resuscitate newborns as well as provide simple medical equipment. This service is greatly needed as it is estimated that 4 million newborns each year. Approximately 10% of these suffer from asphyxia during birth. Nearly 90,000 of these infants die because those who care for them do not know how to resuscitate them.[5] <br>  The Vision Treatment Training program teaches facilities and medical personnel in developing countries how to treat preventable or reversible blindness. There are 45 million people in the world who are blind, and in developing countries being blind often means poverty. So this program helps reduce this problem.[6] <br>  In addition to these efforts, the Mormon Church also has over 250 job development and placement centers around the world. In 2001, the Church began the Perpetual Education Fund which provides money to cover tuition and other school expenses to people in developing nations. As of 2004, tens of thousands of individuals had been given assistance. So far this program has operated primarily in South America and Oceana. The LDS Church has also begun producing a nutrition-rich porridge named Atmit to help during acute famines. The Church Welfare program owns farms, ranches, canneries, and other food producing facilities to provide temporary food relief for families and individuals. LDS Philanthropies frequently works with other charities and NGOs such as the Red Cross, Catholic charities and even various Islamic charities for which the LDS Church has produced halaal food.[7]|`|AA11297267	Most of their "service" is within the church system, at the church welfare farms or bishop's storehouses or other such places.  They also consider it "service" to go to the temple and be baptized for the dead and other such rituals.<br>  <br>  When I was a teen, our monthly "service project" was to go up to a chicken ranch and either shovel chicken poop, candle eggs, or pack eggs.  At the time I thought the church owned the ranch.  I now live in the town where the ranch is, and what do you know...the church doesn't own it, a local mormon family does and runs if for-profit (though they do "tithe" in eggs to the church welfare system).  So basically what I did my teen years was work my butt off shoveling chicken poop so that a local business could make more profit and give the church more tithing.  What a scam.<br>  <br>  There are, of course, mormons who do real community services -- and that's good.  No amount of community service, however, can make up for the absurdities of their proven-wrong beliefs.  Sorry.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|rx20pKgOaa	Alissa - it's the end of the tri and I am a special education teacher trying to help my students get some passing grades!

There are over 2,000 projects that church is currently involved in right now. Some are started and fully funded by the church, but the majority is actually other churches and non profit organization without LDS church affiliation that the LDS church financially supports and physically supports. You can also go from this page to other links that give you lists of what you can do to help current projects, i know one right now that they are trying to get people to do is to put together hygiene kits and send them in... there are others as well. hope this help.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.providentliving.org/project/0,13501,4607-1-2008,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.providentliving.org/project/0...</a>|`|uD8d5V9Saa	A question asked by a mormon, to mormons, so they can make themselves look good.<br>  I am waiting for some mormon to ask again " Why are mormons so happy?"

78KEwtUXaa	When you say "the same rights as people," do you realize what that entails? Are you saying we should charge someone with murder if they kill an animal? On that same note, why not charge an animal with murder if it kills another animal? Do we have to give them homes and occupations? Should we outlaw the sale of meat, fur, milk, and eggs? How far to you plan on going with this? Can we not kill a spider in our home? Heck, why not include plants; make it illegal to mow your lawn! The point is, that humans have dominion over animals. Since animals can't progress technologically, can't communicate with humans, and can be a vital rescource to human life by eating them, testing medicine and products on them to make sure they're safe for humans, and using their fur, they are not entightled to all of humans' rights. I'm not saying we should torture animals for fun or kill them for sport, but if animals have a genuine use to humans, their discomfort of even death is worth it. I think we need to make people our main concern.|`|xL6McXTfaa	no, animals should not be able to vote, or petition, or peacably assemble, it wouldn't make sense.  I do think that animals should be killed more humanely though.|`|hQSQx83Taa	It's possible that I'm intentionally misinterpreting the question here, but humans have a lot of rights that can't even be applied to animals, such as (in the US) freedom of speech. So... no. They shouldn't. It wouldn't make sense. <br>  <br>  I do think that cruelty to animals should be illegal, however, which is what I think you're really asking.|`|16ce5c8b2b4e1c765742c42329522cc5aa	No.  Animals do have rights and should be treated with kindness but I dont think a fully grown lion should be sitting at the table next to me in my favorite restaurant (smile)|`|NjSWQFBYaa	No, they taste too good.<br>  <br>  <br>  Besides, God told Noah and his descendants (us) that we have the right to eat meat. God said the same thing to peter in the N.T. If God said that eating meat was OK, then why should I listen to you instead?<br>  <br>  ==edit==<br>  <br>  I agree that it is wrong to be unnecessarily cruel to animals, but I will still eat them.<br>  <br>  BTW, you misspelled "poll".
4r6d8Aieaa	I want that heart that beats for me.<br>  or<br>  I love that heart that beats for me.<br>  <br>  I want to meet you(conocer por primera vez)<br>  or <br>  I want to know you. (saber todo de ella)<br>  <br>  Walk beside me. (anda a mi lado)<br>  or <br>  Walk with me. (anda conmigo)<br>  <br>  under the sun<br>  <br>  I don't want to be away from you. (No quiero estar lejos de ti.)<br>  or <br>  I don't want to leave your side (No quiero dejar tu lado.)<br>  <br>  give me your eyes in dark times<br>  <br>  give me your hands with your love<br>  <br>  Look inside of me. (mira dentro de mi)<br>  <br>  you do it better than me<br>  <br>  I dont want to dream anymore<br>  <br>  I want to be junto a ti. (I want to be together with you.)<br>  <br>  Give me your feet to start to walk again  (Dame tus pies para empezar de caminar de nuevo)<br>  <br>  Give me passion to look for you more and more (Dame la pasión para buscarte más y más.)<br>  <br>  Give me passion to look at you more and more. (Dame la pasión para mirarte más y más.)<br>  <br>  I just want to know what are you thinking|`|MBH7xIwUaa	"I want that heart that beat for me"<br>  <br>  "I wanna meet you" means I want to see you and introduce myself to you, "I wanna know you" means I want to understand who you truly are and find out who you are as a person.<br>  <br>  "Walk next to me" is asking someone to walk somewhere with you. "Walk to me" is asking someone to walk to where you are.<br>  <br>  I would suggest saying "I don't want to part from you" "I don't want to leave you" "I don't want to part from your side" or "I don't want to leave your side" <br>  <br>  "Give me your eyes in dark times" makes sense as a sentence... though I don't understand what you mean by it.<br>  <br>  "Give me your feet to start to walk again" makes sense as a sentence but I don't understand what you mean.<br>  <br>  "Give me passion to look for you more and more"<br>  <br>  And everything I didn't say anything about seemed correct to me.|`|MSST8jNlaa	1. I want your heart to beat when you think of me<br>  2. I want to get to know you.<br>  3: Walk beside me<br>  4. Under the sun<br>  5, I don't want to separate us.<br>  6. Lend me you eyes in dark times<br>  7.Lend me your love with your hands<br>  8. See me for who I am<br>  9. You do it better than me<br>  10. I don't just want to dream anymore<br>  11.???<br>  12. I will pick you up when you fall?<br>  13. Give me passion so I can find you?<br>  <br>  Tried to clean them up as best as I could.|`|oa0rN2zwaa	omg i love these words they are soooooo romantice u must be falling for someone|`|578p57Syaa	1. the second one<br>  2. both correct but meet it just to see and maybe talk to but know you is to really know everything about them<br>  3. both correct but next is directly to the side and walk to me is more like come to me<br>  4.neither are correct but you could say i dont want to leave your side<br>  5. sort of correct but wierd<br>  6.i think its correct but nobody really says that<br>  7.No, not sure what you mean<br>  8.correct<br>  9. Its not possible to do that but its correct<br>  10.You started writing in some other language...?<br>  11.Neither.<br>  12.Not really any sentence like that|`|287ryVgFaa	LOL @ see my interior...|`|3906f43b843cc7c4980882fdeb0526a7aa	Most of these phrases are not used in English so I'm not sure what you are trying to say, but here are my best guesses:<br>  <br>  1. "I wish your heart beat for me" would seem to mean I wish you were mine.<br>  2.  I want to meet you or know you are both correct.  Meet implies just getting together like for a date, to know someone would be to take time to learn much more about them.   <br>  3.  Walk next to me is walk along with me, walk to me is to come to me from some where else. <br>  4.  Under the sun is used to make a sweeping comment like "I love all people under the sun."<br>  5.  I don't want to be apart from you would be like saying I never want us to be separated, or you could say I don't want to part with you.  ( part is an action word that means to take things away from each other, but apart would describe things that are already separate)<br>  6.  Give me your eyes isn't used in English and does not make much sense.  Something similar would be "stand by me in dark times." or maybe "In dark times I think of you and feel better."  <br>  7.  Give me your hands is not used either.  We say "lend me a hand" which means please help me."   <br>  8.  The word interior is not used in reference to body or soul, only for things like a house interior.  I think what you are trying to say is "you see me on the inside" which would mean to know how I feel. <br>  9.  You do it better than me is OK.<br>  10.  I don't want to dream is OK.<br>  11.   I have no idea what junto and ti are.  This is apparently from a song but makes no sense in English.  <br>  12.  Like before, we don't say "give me your feet or hands or eyes, etc.  It would make more sense to just say "help me to walk again."<br>  13.  Give me passion is like saying make me love you, which makes no sense.  If you are passionate about someone you already have the passion, why would you need to ask them for it?  I would say instead " Every time I see you my passion grows."<br>  14.  I just want to know what you are thinking is very beautiful and is fine just as you wrote it.   <br>  <br>  I hope this helps --- Good Luck!|`|AA11564934	sweet bouncing buddha, i was going to help with one or two, but wow...|`|tK7XacH7aa	1) I want that heart that beats for me. The first one is just confusing.<br>  <br>  2) I wanna meet you - this is an informal way of saying that you want to get to know the person. I wanna know you - well this is a more formal way of saying it, but the best way to say it is. "I want to get to know you"<br>  <br>  3) Walk next to me - that's like walking right at your side. Walk to me - is saying you want the person to come to you. I'm not sure what you're trying to say, but you said it right both times<br>  <br>  4) Under the sun - sounds good<br>  <br>  5) "I don't want to be apart from you." In this case you don't need to say side and in the second one you said "apart of your side" which means to physically be a part of the person.<br>  <br>  6) Give me your eyes in dark times<br>  <br>  7) Give me your hands with your love<br>  <br>  8) See my interior - well I'm not sure what you're trying to say, but sure<br>  <br>  9) You do it better than me<br>  <br>  10) I don't want to dream anymore<br>  <br>  11) I want to be with you - don't use spanglish<br>  <br>  12) ?? How about "Hand me your feet so you can start to walk again"<br>  <br>  13) Give me passion so I may continue to look for you

When I see someone picking their nose I wish they'd go deeper and pop a vessel in their brain!|`|7gH7sgi6aa	Honestly ~ The WORST.

A thorough reading of all of his comments regarding women leads us to believe that he was talking about the order in the church.<br>  <br>  He was very much fed up with the squabbling and even went so far as to tell the Corinthians that he was glad that he hadn't baptized any of them (he later recanted and admitted that he had baptized some).<br>  <br>  One of the things that I think we fail to recognize in Paul's Epistles is that these are letters of instruction for specific groups of people and the instructions for one group may not necessarily apply to a different group. While certain teachings are important to recognize in Paul's letters, such as his teachings on the resurrection, other instructions have to do more with practices than anything else. The comments about the place women have in the church (at Corinth) is a practice and not a doctrine.<br>  <br>  Edit Add. Rico JPA may have it right with his comment about the 4th century joke book. It certain fits in with the rest of the problems in Corinth that Paul wrote about.<br>  <br>  2nd Edit Add: I tend to ignore question that repeatedly challenge practices in various churches. I see comments about the passage you mentioned and I go on to the next question. Cutting and pasting responses is a waste of time. People like the one you are talking about really don't want a response. They just want to rant.<br>  <br>  We see the same thing leveled against various denominations on a continuing basis and the same issue rehashed over and over again... some of which are purely political in nature (Obama and Prop8, for instance).|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Actually he's worse than ever:  Earlier on a question regarding learning Greek he answered with it didn't matter 'cause 1 cor 14 says the same in all languages.<br>  <br>  Bet this guy has a "Great" love-life:  I think not.|`|AEZ75dJ7aa	I say we should all pray for him.

They can be whatever they want to be...|`|hmU2udmRaa	who is he?|`|ploioYqraa	I don't get it.|`|l6Jew1qAaa	God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. If He didn't want women to preach "back then" He doesn't want women to preach today. However, there is no indication anywhere that God has a problem with women preaching. Some men have a problem with women preaching, and if they do, they need to go somewhere and listen to a man preach, instead of complaining about women preachers. I don't know who this person is, but really, who cares if he is ranting and raving about female preachers? Let him rant. It doesn't really mean anything in the big picture.|`|gSxYuDEEaa	The Bible does not condone female pastors.  The only one in leadership in the Bible was Deborah as a judge in the book of Judges, but if you read closely you will see she too was advised by men around her.  this is not a discrimination against women, just an instruction by God through Paul to keep the church and the roles of men and women in orderly fashion.  women can teach (IE ladies ministry leaders) just not pastor.|`|nrXCCf76aa	He needs at Joyce Meyer.

I don't know what to say|`|AA11690436	I'm not 100% certain, but I think Corinthians is the only epistle in which Paul makes any sort of mention of women not speaking in Church.  So maybe he was just in a snit about the women from Corinth.   <br>  <br>  The recently rediscovered 4th century joke book, "The Laugh Addict" has a lot of jabs and loud mouthed Corinthian women.  Maybe they were famous blabber mouths.  Maybe Paul just like Thessalonian women a lot better?  Who knows?|`|WjRqYf6naa	I've just quit answering his questions.

Its an excellent video, and will help u tons with your hw.|`|koynaDYbaa	I done that essay too:<br>  Here's mine...<br>  FEEL FREE !!<br>  ...<br>  <br>  <br>  “Euthanasia should be legalized in the UK” – Do you agree? Show in your answer you have got more than one point of view.<br>  <br>  In my opinion I don’t think Euthanasia should be legalized in the UK for a number of reasons.<br>  Firstly it could cause a lot of problems in the UK, for example people finding ways of faking death, possibly murders or even selfish family members forcing Euthanasia. I don’t think it would be safe to take these risks. <br>  Secondly I believe life is sacred and we shouldn’t end it by just taking the easy way out. We have been given a gift to be able to live and I don’t think we should be given the power to end it. We as humans have been born naturally so we should die naturally as well. I believe in the sanctity of life meaning that each and everyone of our lives is unique because it comes from God.<br>  I think trying to carry on living despite having an illness, for example, is a sign of courage and strength and much better than just wanting to die. The UK would become an unhealthy society if more and more people would be willing to end their lives.<br>  I also believe the final stages of life are very important and should be celebrated with friends and family healthily and naturally.<br>  If Euthanasia would be allowed for certain illnesses then where would the bottom line be? Where would it stop? It would become a habit and more common which I don’t think is right.<br>  <br>  On the other hand I also believe in free speech and if people really want to end their lives then it is up to them to make the decision, nobody should force them to or not to. <br>  If someone is critically ill and really feels it is the only way out then I understand their circumstances. If it was one of my family members I wouldn’t force them not to, but I would still advise them in trying to keep faith with God and to be strong.<br>  <br>  In conclusion I think instead of Euthanasia being legalised, more hospices helping the dying, ill or depressed should be opened to help them go through everything. Such as Dame Cecily Saunders’ hospices.|`|UibsALccaa	This is such a controversial topic and I still haven't decided if it's right or wrong. But I'm think I disagree more than agree. I mean if you are in SERIOUS pain then maybe. But then again, Allaah gave us life so what right to we have to take it? For all you know, the pain and suffering your are going through may get you into Jannah.|`|qky7gWosaa	It is absurd to end your life either painlessly or excruciatingly. Suicide/Murder is forbidden in Islam, end of. I disagree with Euthanasia.|`|0iTNDPzoaa	No only God has the right to take away lives when he wills.
Ex4Lv68yaa	No, I don't agree.  In my opinion, we are eternal beings living in several different realms of reality.  When I pass from this life I believe I will continue on in another realm or reality.<br>  <br>  Even Astrophysicists are exploring Multi-Universes and parallel realms.  There is also the possibility that we may exist in many other realms at the same time!  :)  I may be living in another realm doing something completely different that what I am doing now.  "Neat."  :)<br>  <br>  The possibilities are endless...  Why would there be this extremely vast and endless Universe for there to be only one go around at Life?  :)  That wouldn't make any sense.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	If you consider death a separation from others (which is one of its definitions) and that separation is permanent, then I agree. However, if there is any possibility that the separation is not permanent, then it is obviously not the end.<br>  <br>  I don't know if you are asking about life after a person dies (beyond death), NDEs (Near Death Experiences) have been well documented and noted in the medical community. Whether these count or not is open to debate, but they (and their consistency on a number of points) suggests that there is an existence of some kind after this one.|`|355JLlcLaa	Yes, I agree.<br>  <br>  I think it will be - or rather, not - like during the billions of years before we were conceived.<br>  <br>  The pathways in our brains and nervous systems, as well as the ways other parts of our bodies are configured, are what go to make our personalities and the notion, or illusion, of self. There's no such thing as a soul.<br>  <br>  After we're dead that configuration is gone, and it can start to go before death. We as persons will be no more; and in the same way we could not have been here "before".<br>  <br>  The molecular components of my body will of course be distributed and some may reappear in other living creatures, but they will then go to make up the new individual, but that isn't the same thing as me coming back or rebirth.<br>  <br>  Those who are left to mourn our passing will hopefully have some happy memories of us once they get over their grief.|`|b23e3ca87d32dda5732ada9427cb2644aa	I don't give opinions wisdom of man is nothing top an all knowing God who said because you sinned you will die. A lier Satan said God is a lier and you will not die who do you believe. God is the cause of everthing good we are a cause of the bad. God is life sin is rebellion to God/Life. God is eternal if you live for God and accept the salvation God gave through Jesus you get Life(which is eternal) seek knowledge once you see both sides of why Go id, and the other side of God not being even though God can't be proven not to be and you believe if you want to you will find God.|`|kPmzj4Rcaa	Well, i'm agnostic [:<br>  I do believe there is a god out there somewhere - just i need some kind of proof.

I think that maybe there is some kind of after life, but yeah until i die, i'm not sure ?|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	No, cause the Bible says that those who believe in Jesus will go to Heaven.

Now we are talking<br>  I do agree.<br>  i believe the death is about the body so once the body is dead that's it. But the soul does have everlasting existence in heaven like promised in the church. the reason is a belief of course.<br>  <br>  The argument is probably that some people believe in life after death and some don't. The church indeed promises life after death. But what is usually understood with life is our lifestyle on Earth. I do downbeatthat life in heaven even if i am let it would be quite the same so i call it existance. Another argument for me is that life is something that can come to an end. And as once you are in heaven you stay there, you can't really call it a life.|`|Ac3Z0RLuaa	No, for two reasons. <br>  <br>  A) I believe death is just the beginning of your life in Heaven (or just the continuation of your life in Heaven)<br>  <br>  B) I believe after being in Heaven for a certain period of time you reincarnate to earth, thus you begin a different life on earth.<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW I said this if you were talking about the whole afterlife thing. If your talking abour "raising the dead", I can't help you there/|`|qBOPQQQpaa	Once you're dead you are not dead forever......I am living proof that before death I was unconscious, which is being dead, and now I am alive and  here answering your question...........therefore, being dead is not a forever thing...........life is an undiscovered force, energy,  and matter and energy cannot be destroyed, only transformed.....one into the other .........so then, death is going through a cosmic door into another state of being.........|`|iXI7n6Gmaa	The fact that matter is not destroyed is a very strong proof that death is not the end of it!<br>  <br>  We dissolve into the parts that we were created from but the fact that DNA and Genome stays for ever is another Hint that we stay on.<br>  <br>  The soul factor in us will also move on this the life after death that everyone denies.|`|iAtanlT8aa	No, I believe that time works in a loop, not needing to be started or ended, so that once I day, time continues in a loop back to my birth where my life starts over again.  I will live the exact same life again without any recollection of the last one.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	The truth is that death brings IMMEDIATE heaven or hell, depending ONLY on whether you believe in Jesus alone for salvation or not. <br>  <br>  So to be in heaven and not hell, believe in Jesus alone for salvation now! :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|4sUqTjc8aa	Life after death. I have personally seen two ghosts.

True your body and consciousness are gone but your genes can live on in your children also the molecules and atoms that make up your body break up and become something else so they live on|`|qKhGAADMaa	no i do not agree. my reason? because we know too much and we are so precious in God's eyes to accept that there isn't more to life than just living then dying.

Our physical bodies are merely a vessel that contains our true being. We are 1% mind and body, 99% spirit. After we leave this trial life, we are either returned to the heavenly Father in the spiritual realm, or seperated from Him. We get to chose now, not later. God wants our souls to be close to Him, but so does the devil. And he will lie and deceive to prevent us from returning to our real HOME. The devil is the destroyer of souls, but Jesus is the RESTORER.|`|ZNRYqss9aa	People could be reincarnated there is a lot of proof that follows that argument.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	I agree this is most probably true. Our thoughts, memories, personalities, ability to feel are all the product of our organic brains. These stop functioning and decompose upon our death. There is no actual evidence for anything like a soul or spirit that survives death and no knowledge that we have that could explain how it could continue on with any of our individual personalities and memories intact.

TT0rCi8kaa	There are many options open to the poor, in these circumstances.<br>  Drug Dealing, while adding to the social toilet in which they are forced to live, can generate enough Capitol to escape their geographical confines, (so long as the person doesn't fall victim to the lifestyle) and buy a nice little place in the suburbs. For day to day "gettiing by" there is always Street Mugging, which, depending on the street chosen, can be a lucrative little earner. Also shoplifting. That can provide some much needed subsidised goods, into the whole community, an option where everyone benefits. And speaking of benefits, Benefit fraud is always quite popular, and fairly simple to do, with options varying between Invisible Lodgers, to Bogus Children, with horrifying medical conditions. <br>  Then there's always Prostitution, as popular as ever with todays Crackheads, and Tweakers, or even Pimping, they seem to be just as in demand with todays "high powered kerb crawlers",<br>  So you see, there are plenty of options, you just have to "shop around" for the one that suits you.<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Good question.<br>  Yes, a lot of poor people feel trapped and feel like they cant get out. A lot of them get caught up in what I like to call- "poor culture"- which usually has a lot of violence and young teenage sex ( like at 12, 13, 14 yrs old ). Guys get in violence, girls get pregnant. It becomes a cycle. <br>  <br>  Not to mention their crappy schools. I also want to point out they tend not be from the best families that encourage them academically. Half them don't graduate from high school. And they complain about how they can't get anywhere in life... <br>  <br>  Our best bet is to better the schools, so we can teach them better values. We should also make more after school activities so they can be involved in something other than sex, drugs, and violence. We need to make learning more interesting. We need to tell them they are worth something and are smart and can succeed in life. The trap can be diminished.<br>  <br>  Education is the only way out of poverty and they can't go to college without graduating from high school first.|`|ba4R1tf1aa	Yes, but how do some of them rise past that?

It's never too late either.|`|j5YwuVEIaa	Poverty—Finding the Permanent Solution<br>  IN SPITE of negative reports from around the world about poverty, there are those who remain optimistic that something concrete can be done. For example, according to a headline in the Manila Bulletin, the Asian Development Bank reported that “Asia can eradicate poverty in 25 years.” The bank recommended economic growth as a way to pull people from the depths of poverty.<br>  Other organizations and governments have put forth a long list of suggestions and plans to try to solve the problem. Among them are: social insurance programs, improved education, canceling debts developing nations owe to industrialized nations, removing import barriers so that nations with a large percentage of poor people can sell their products more easily, and low-income housing for the poor.<br>  In the year 2000, the United Nations General Assembly set goals to be achieved by 2015. These included the eliminating of extreme poverty and hunger as well as gross inequality of income within countries. However noble such goals may be, many doubt that they can be achieved in this disunited world.<br>  Practical Steps to Deal With Poverty<br>  Since hope for real progress on a worldwide scale is slim, where can a person turn for help? As mentioned earlier, there is a source of practical wisdom that can help people right now. What is it? It is God’s Word, the Bible.<br>  What makes the Bible different from all other sources of information? It comes from the highest authority, our Creator. He has included in its pages gems of wisdom—practical principles that are applicable to all people, in all places, and at all times. If followed, these principles can help the poor to enjoy a more satisfying life even now. Let us look at a few examples.<br>  Have a proper view of money. The Bible says: “Wisdom is for a protection the same as money is for a protection; but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom itself preserves alive its owners.” (Ecclesiastes 7:12) What is the point? Money is not everything. True, it provides a measure of security. It enables us to buy certain things we need, but it has its limitations. There are things of greater value that money cannot buy. Recognition of this fact will help us keep material things in proper perspective, thus avoiding the frustrations of those whose lives center on the accumulation of money. Money cannot buy life, but acting in wisdom can protect life now and can even open up the possibility of endless life.<br>  Live within your means. Our wants are not necessarily the same as our needs. Priority should be given to our needs. We can easily convince ourselves that we need something, when in reality it is a want and not a need. The wise person will first allot earned income to immediate needs—food, clothing, shelter, and so on. Then, before spending on anything extra, he will determine if his remaining funds can cover additional items. In one of his illustrations, Jesus recommended that a person “first sit down and calculate the expense, to see if he has enough.”—Luke 14:28.<br>  In the Philippines, Eufrosina, a single parent with three children, has had the challenge of earning a living and following a strict budget since her husband left her some years ago. While doing so, she has trained her children to recognize priorities in the budget. For example, the children may see something that they would like. Instead of just saying no, she reasons with them by saying: “Well, you can have that if you like, but you will have to decide. We have enough money for only one thing. We can buy this thing that you like, or we can buy a little meat or vegetables to go along with our rice for this week. Now, which would you like? You decide.” Usually, the children quickly see the point and agree that they would like to have food rather than something else.<br>  Be content. “Having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things,” states another Bible principle. (1?Timothy 6:8) Money in itself does not bring happiness. A lot of wealthy people are unhappy, while many poor people are very happy. These latter ones have learned to be satisfied with just the simple things needed in life. Jesus spoke of having a ‘simple eye’ that is focused on the more important things. (Matthew 6:22) This helps a person to be content. Many poor people feel quite satisfied because they have cultivated a good relationship with God and have a happy family life—things that cannot be purchased with money.<br>  These are just a few examples of the Bible’s practical suggestions that can help those who are poor to cope with their situation. There are many more. For instance, avoid such vices as smoking and gambling, which waste resources; identify the more important things in life, particularly spiritual goals; where employment is limited, try to provide a skill or service that others need. (Proverbs 22:29; 23:21; Philippians 1:9-11) The Bible recommends application of such “practical wisdom and thinking ability” because “they wil|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	how about "Up?"<br>  <br>  During the 19th Century millions of people came to American and walked straight off the boat into neighborhoods filled with poverty and crime. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell's_Kitchen,_Manhattan" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell's_Kitc...</a><br>  <br>  The prevailing ethic at that time was one of self reliance and upward mobility.

2V4JHa1Saa	Satyresses are the female equivalent to satyrs, depicted with a human head and torso, generally including bare breasts, but the body of a goat from waist down. They were a late invention by poets and artists and are comparatively rare in classical art. Such a creature may also be known as a fauness, but this nomenclature is rarely seen in English; faunesse is the spelling in French.<br>  <br>  Though not often seen compared to the omnipresent depictions of male satyrs and centaurs, the satyress figure was certainly not unknown to classical artists. Michelangelo included a haggard satyress nursing drunken toddlers at her elderly breasts in his 1533 work, The Children's Bacchanal.<br>  <br>  The Art Institute of Chicago has an example of a beautiful, mature satyress accompanied by putti and a male satyr in a 16th century study by Paolo Farinati of Italy. A third satyr figure is presented in rear three-quarter view and its gender cannot be definitively determined, though the glimpse of the chest suggests small female breasts are present.[2] The Art Institute also holds a bronze candlestand or oil lamp of a mature female satyr seated with her satyr-son leaning against her knee while she holds a light aloft. The tentative date on this work is circa 1500, pushing the motif back into the 15th century.<br>  <br>  Clodion used the motif in a work which is now in the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland: Female Satyr Carrying Two Putti. This young and healthy satyress is striding upright, carrying a squirming cherub in each arm. At least one small terra cotta satyress depicted reclining was created by a student of Clodion in the late 18th or early 19th Century, but is in a private collection.<br>  <br>  Giambattista Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, an 18th century Venetian painter in the rococo style, painted at least two works with a satyress as the main figure: Satyress with a Putto and Satyress With Two Putti and a Tambourine. Although satyrs are generally shown seducing human women, Tiepolo drew Satyr Surprising A Satyress, which depicts a hirsute satyr grasping a relatively bare-skinned satyress around the waist.<br>  <br>  The satyress is common in modern fantasy art. They may be portrayed as normal human women with the hind legs of a goat and a tail. In modern fantasy art, they commonly are shown with pointed ears and horns as well. Aubrey Beardsley has drawn the satyress figure in this style.|`|0byq7c1maa	they mated with nymphs if the baby was male it was a satyr female a nymph.|`|X9XbaBNkaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyr" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyr</a><br>  <br>  Check out this Wiki - apparently in mythology there werent but later on in art they mentioned them.

AA11796124	Yes.<br>  <br>  ENVY - Sadness or discontent at the excellence, good fortune, or success of another person. It implies that one considers oneself somehow deprived by what one envies in another or even that an injustice has been done. Essential to envy is this sense of deprivation. consequently it is not merely sadness that someone else has some desirable talent or possession, nor certainly the ambition to equal or surpass another person, which can be laudable emulation. It is not the same as jealousy, which implies an unwillingness to share one's own possessions. <br>  <br>  Envy is a sin against charity and, though serious in itself, allows of degrees of gravity depending on whether fully consented to and how important is the object envied. The most serious sin of envy is sadness at the supernatural gifts or graces that another has received from God, i.e., to envy sanctity. (Etym. Latin invidia; from invidere, to look askance.)|`|v0BCIQpnaa	Help me out, is jealousy different for Protestants?

I used to believe that card readings and the like had some validity to them but after seeing how people embraced every little snippet of semi-accurate information and completely ignored the missed bits I became convinced that there was nothing more to it than keen observation skills and the natural desire of the average person to want these sorts of things to be true. <br>  <br>  Visit a reader if you wish.

Anyone who predicts dark things and then wants to charge you more money is a fraud.

He urged Timothy: “Honor widows that are actually widows.” (Verse?3) Elderly widows were singled out as particularly worthy of receiving honor in the form of regular financial support. Such ones were cut off from all visible means of support and could only ‘put their hope in God and persist in supplications and prayers night and day.’ (Verse?5) How were their prayers for sustenance answered? Through the congregation. In an organized manner, deserving widows were provided with a modest livelihood. Of course, if a widow had financial means, or relatives capable of supporting her, such provisions were unnecessary.—Verses 4,?16.<br>  5 “But the [widow] that goes in for sensual gratification,” cautioned Paul, “is [spiritually] dead though she is living.” (Verse?6) Paul does not explain how some were, as the Kingdom Interlinear literally renders it, “behaving voluptuously.” Some may have been fighting a battle with their “sexual impulses.” (Verse?11) However, according to Liddell & Scott’s Greek-English Lexicon, “behaving voluptuously” could also have involved ‘living softly or in excessive comfort or indulgence.’ Perhaps, then, some wanted the congregation to enrich them, to finance an extravagant, self-indulgent life of immoderation. Whatever the case, Paul indicates that such ones were disqualified from receiving congregation support.<br>  6 Paul then said: “Let a widow be put on the list [of those receiving financial support] who has become not less than sixty years old.” In Paul’s day a woman over age 60 was evidently viewed as unable to support herself and unlikely to remarry. “On the other hand,” Paul said, “turn down younger widows [for enrollment], for when their sexual impulses have come between them and the Christ, they want to marry, having a judgment because they have disregarded their first expression of faith.”—Verses 9, 11,?12.<br>  7 Had “the list” been open to younger widows, some might hastily have declared an intention to remain single. As time passed, though, they might have had difficulty controlling their “sexual impulses” and wanted to remarry, ‘having a judgment for disregarding their first expression of faith’ to remain single. (Compare Ecclesiastes 5:2-6.) Paul averted such problems, further declaring, “I desire the younger widows to marry, to bear children.”—Verse?14.<br>  8 The apostle also limited enrollment to those with long records of fine Christian works. (Verse?10) The congregation was thus not a “welfare state” for the lazy or the greedy. (2?Thessalonians 3:10,?11) But what of elderly men or younger widows? If such ones fell into need, the congregation would no doubt have cared for them on an individual basis.—Compare 1?John 3:17,?18.<br>  9 Such arrangements were likely quite adequate for the needs of first-century congregations. But as The Expositor’s Bible Commentary observes: “Today, with insurance income, social security, and job opportunities, the situation is very different.” As a result of a changed social and economic picture, rarely is it necessary for congregations today to maintain lists of elderly beneficiaries. Nevertheless, Paul’s words to Timothy help us appreciate: (1)?The problems of the elderly are of concern to the entire congregation—particularly the elders. (2)?The care of the elderly should be properly organized. (3)?Such care is limited to those truly in need.|`|Wath3T94aa	<a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?t=KJV&x=0&y=0&b=1Ti&c=5&v=1#vrsn/9" rel="nofollow">http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm...</a><br>  1 tim 5:9 <br>  always look at context<br>  "A widow who is put on the list for support must be a woman who is at least sixty years old and was faithful to her husband"<br>  5:12 "Then they would be guilty of breaking their previous pledge."<br>  their pledge, is to the church; to be supported by it as one of the widows would imply that they were a backbone.. constructive and helping as they can.|`|gC5eFMyTaa	If they were to make a Younger Widow, in charge of their local Church.

Will my children hear their mother called names?  I hope not, but it may happen.<br>  <br>  We intend to be picky who we socialize our children around, but that may not be an option, since we want to raise them as Muslims, and one of the best ways to do that is to have them around Muslims a lot.  It's too bad, and I was disappointed to hear that today too.  I also went passed my tolerance level, and spoke out when perhaps I shouldn't (religiously, at least, I should have just kept quiet).<br>  <br>  Anyway, inshallah we will both be luckier as time goes on.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Thanks @ Asker<br>  <br>  To the rest:  The incident (I believe) the asker is referring to was a female member of Y!A calling non-Muslims filth, not a male.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Islam does not mean peace.

rThIVk2maa	Hehehe, i've dealt with this before... the "girl" that just seems to pop up everywhere. <br>  <br>  Your boyfriend likely doesn't know how she feels, or is ignoring her, which I encourage you to do too. When he talks about her, you can say "yeahhhhh... I'm sorry, how is it you two are still friends?" in an incredulous tone of voice. Also being all blissful and romantic together in front of her is likely to annoy her into going away as well. <br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, I suggest you turn your attention to your man.

Are you afraid he's getting a little over there amongst the feces  and dirty bathroom smells?  <br>  <br>  Do you have friends he doesn't approve of also?  Growing together or growing apart, are what we do with each other when we, a man and a woman, are in a relationship.  I think the fact that he discusses this friendship of his is a positive thing.  You feel comfortable with your own relationship, so let his other platonic relationship develop as it should.  He will eventually outgrow it, like an old pair of pants with grass stains on them.

12404275a6e62a47f2d36bd0fb0e6886aa	Just today, actually.<br>  <br>  A member of R&S sent a message informing me of a serious family issue. She is a firm believer in prayer. She is my friend. By praying for her situation to improve, I have not caused any harm to myself (or anyone else) and I have spent a few moments of my time in fellowship with her.<br>  <br>  Saying a prayer may seem to be a small act, but it means the world to the one in need.  It is a show of respect, compassion, and concern.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	I honestly can't remember the last time I prayed. I think it would have been the first couple of years when I was in college maybe a few times. Its been about decade now I guess. What I remember praying most fondly is the prayer many parents teach, ''now I lay me down to sleep... '' which I would follow with thinking of everyone I could that I cared about to bless at the end and imagine their faces as I did so. It became something similar to how some people count sheep but thinking good thoughts and of all the people I cared about was a positive thinking sort of exercise. I still do a similar thing in a secular way with an adaptation of the Buddhist loving kindness meditation.|`|DQjAGWXQaa	When I was 4 or something.

GPznIhzMaa	"Why do young kids complain so much that their life is so horrible and we adults would never understand, like we were never kids?"<br>  As adults, it can be hard to sympathize with kids because our plates are full with larger problems concerning work and bills. However, I don't deny that it is important to pay attention when a kid says he's sad.<br>  <br>  "Why do people treat animals like second class citizens? In the end, when it comes down to us or them, they will be able to kill us faster. When we run out of man-made weapons and are back to using our bare hands. Then we wont treat them as such, now will we?"<br>  I agree. I'm completely against the fur industry and I'm all about wildlife conservation. I have a friend who makes fun of me by saying, "I don't care if they all die." Support organizations like the NRDC and Wildlife Conservation Society. Educating the new generations on this topic is very important.<br>  <br>  "Why do "skinny" people always feel offended when a "fat" person makes fun of them, but it's OK for them to make a "fat" person feel socially unacceptable? Why? Because society says "fat" people don't have morals and should be banned from the public, eye, right?"<br>  Well, some people are so skinny they look unhealthy. On the other hand, sometimes heavier people make fun of smaller people to make themselves feel better. It's just all wrong. Don't participate in it.<br>  <br>  "What is it with ignorant people today?" <br>  There are too many of them.|`|z2YcXSvZaa	1st question- because we often speak to them like we don't understand. all we ever tell kids is that they should be glad they're kids without fully explaining why. so it's like we don't understand because we usually don't take the time to think back to when we were kids and dealing with what they have to deal with. and kids actually have it a little harder these days because it seems like parents pay less attention to them.<br>  2nd question- I agree with you. People treat animals like that because we have an advantage over them by us being able to think logically and consciously. But that's not an excuse. <br>  3rd question- I'm actually a skinny person and I don't like when people pick on me because i've dealt with being skinny my whole life and I can't seem to change it. I don't pick on fat people because being really fat is almost like being really skinny. you get picked on, you're most likely unhealthy, and it's often hard to find clothes that look good on you. It's not okay to make anyone feel socially unacceptable. I don't know what "society" says about fat people.|`|3a5gIvswaa	the first question i think you might have the answer yourself i am sure you did have moments where you thought your elders knew nothing and you knew everything that there was to know about teenage life. the issue of changing times could also be the reason for that the fact that the times you grew up in  are entirely different from ours.<br>  <br>  the second question i think like you said people are ignorant we do not think of animals that way for since we were born there is little harm that they have done to human kind, controling and taming the wild is much easier now.<br>  <br>  question three what we make of the world is what our environment and what the global world presents to and fat people seem to have no dignified place in this world.

AA12006309	Yep, they do.  They're preoperative or postoperative transsexuals, or possibly crossdressers.  They're mostly isolated to the porn industry, as the majority of transsexuals and transgender people would consider being called "shemale" or "ladyboy" to be derogatory.|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	Yes<br>  <br>  They mainly work in the sex industry|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Yup.  Although the better term would be "transwomen" or "T-girls".|`|5ypdHLtGaa	uh yeah, you can look up the pics if you really want to but i'd advise against it.

They exist alright|`|3llK5y7Baa	yes they exist! they walk among us !!<br>  <br>  but i have never met one=/|`|3OZgcntfaa	Urban legends? No.<br>  <br>  Shemale is a type of porn genre. It's derogatory to call a human being a shemale.<br>  <br>  Ladyboy is a term that has been taken from Thailand. The Thai term I believe is actually kathoey. The concept behind the term is similar, but not exactly the same as transwoman. Ladyboy is more of a third sex representation than male or female. These individuals do indeed exist. I'm not sure if the term ladyboy is considered derogatory, you would have to ask someone in that situation.|`|4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	They exist.<br>  <br>  However, these are terms limited to the porn industry for the most part and it is not polite to refer to anyone by those terms UNLESS they identify with them and say it's okay. Most transwomen and transmen see it as very rude and insulting, but I'm sure there's at least one person out there who doesn't mind those terms.<br>  <br>  Rule of thumb, don't use such terms at all unless you're referring to porn. :P If you see a "girl with a penis" or a "boy with a vagina", then use the terms transwoman or transman. It's less likely to get you beaten up.|`|rTscI3Lwaa	*giggle* yeah they are real. and if they are not then wow what a very clever trick indeedee|`|v2ut95Wzaa	Yes, you can have a sex change if that is what you mean??|`|62pCvaXGaa	Of course they do.|`|ufdFei1jaa	They are out there!|`|9gkp06QGaa	yes they do exist|`|C0yagFFoaa	check out al the porn mate, they exist in vast numbers|`|T8EbdV9laa	yes they do.if you mean cross-dressers then we do exsist and walk around you every day. some of just wear panties in public.|`|150ffcb711824f9fc3252407402a28adaa	Well, I've seen some porn previews and, yup - they're real.

In Christianity - Jesus is from the line of David.<br>  <br>  1 Samuel 28<br>  16 Samuel said, "Why do you consult me, now that the LORD has turned away from you and become your enemy? 17 The LORD has done what he predicted through me.

How about the Ammonites? (Ammon Jordan is at least at peace with Israel in modern times. )<br>  The current Palestinians are squatting Arabs, who even the Arab nations do not want back in their own lands. <br>  <br>  The Bible provides testimony of the Title Deed to Israel belonging to the Jews, as King David purchases the land of Mt.

I guess jews for allah haven't read that far yet....<br>  <br>  EDIT: Joshua 10:7 says: So Joshua and his whole military force, including all the fighting men, came from Gilgal<br>  <br>  So I give up, what's Jos?|`|gSxYuDEEaa	Yes God often punished the wayward children of Israel and used foreign heathen lands and people to punish them.  incidentally, those same nations that he used to punish Israel were rebuked and punished for coming against His chosen.  bottom line, be obedient to God and do not come against Israel.

The land assigned to Israel in the 1947 partition was land owned and settled by Jews. They bought much of it from the Arabs who were there. They say it is theirs because they have the receipts. The rest of Israel they won in wars after being attacked by Arab nations. If you're going to say that land won in war is not to be kept, there are a lot of nations on this planet that will have to redraw their borders.|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	I won't worry about it until America is given back to Native American tribes.  Land ownership is tricky.|`|OnWmqs4paa	All right just tell us where you found it!  Why would a professed atheist read the Bible anyhow...|`|AA11690436	Yeah, but then he later told the Jews to slaughter all the Ammonites, and David beat back the Phillistines.  Samuel is the transition between the Judges and the Kings.  God's kinda funny that way.  "I'm going to punish you by sending you into slavery for four hundred years.  Then I'm going to punish the people who I allowed to enslave you.  Plus, you'd better be darn grateful to me for freeing you."<br>  <br>  Jews and Palestinians need to stop looking back and start looking forward.  After World War 1 the British took control of the region away from the Ottoman Turks (and Turks may be majority Muslim but are not in any way shape or form Semitic, like Jews and Arabs).  After World War 2, the British partitioned the land into two segments, and expected one to be the Jewish State, the other, across the Jordan River, was to be the Arab state.  Guess What?  It's called Jordan.  Not that this has worked out a whole lot better than the British partitioning the Jewel in the British Crown into two Countries, India and Pakistan, but you don't hear them going on and on about Mogul Invasions or Hindu Hegemony (oops, I guess you do hear that  if you listen...never mind).<br>  <br>  Still the point is, let's all start dealing with modern political realities and not trying to find out who's got the deed signed by God (cause I don't think there is one.)

What is your purpose?<br>  <br>  If you;re in the woods, enjoy the woods, the silence, the wildlife - you don't need to do a ritual, just being there and being one with it all is sufficient.  feel the energy of the trees, be silent and listen, and watch, no need to clutter the place up with things - just be. A skill that is good to learn. <br>  <br>  Why carry an altar when you have the essence of the natural world all around <shakes head><br>  <br>  Tools and things are nice to have, but they mean nothing and are not necessary, despite what it might say in the latest teen witch book. You and you alone are all you need. Do not be distracted by the externals - everyone rushes round saying oh I need this and I need that - all "nice to have's" but truly ritual is more than fancy words, the words are externals to set in motion inner changes, you can do this in silence, sitting in the woods.<br>  <br>  I hope you have a fruitful time, and leave the altar at home please!!

I don't go on vacations that are discounted because I sit through a sales pitch for a time share, I either pay up front for my vacation or I don't go...sitting through a sales pitch is not a vacation to me...:)|`|y7HD8unTaa	Rumor has it that people are just "dying to get it"!<br>  I wondered why all that digging was going on around the merry go posts of that see-through fence.  My allergies are really acting up from those tractor mowers & workers with the weed-eaters beautifying the outer limits of the plot that thickens with each post I read.  Is this how the feds say "howdy", in the new age of digital?  <br>  I'll TRY not to crank up my music & wake any of the dead people that come a'knocken!  Alert the UPS dude that we'd like our package delivered in good condition...we need our new shoes or we start visiting the dead up close & personal...HOWDY! (now I know why someone else often uses that same word)...I like Howdy-Doody.  He's the ugly one with a hand controling him too.  Funny how life really DOES imitate art!!!<br>  <br>  Perhaps sitting under an elm tree with a cool beverage will allow the sales people time to realize that none of it matters much to those who can see life as a spectator sport.  Just hang up on them or stare at them & say nothing...then go inside & call the 911 operator & report an intruder.   They will run when they hear the sirens.|`|4SF4KGu4aa	In the US, I just put my name on the "do not call list" and also "do not mail list" for a number of things.<br>  <br>  My mother-in-law bought my wife and I grave plots about 25 years ago.

lqP9ayLKaa	Difficult to answer question as any group you chose has an implication that the persecution and suffering of others is less important. <br>  <br>  Equally it is not possible to scale the level of suffering and persecution each historical group has undergone without establishing some seriously arbitrary measuring systems - Were the American Indians persecuted more than the Celtic tribes? The proximity of the American Indian suffering implies yes, but Vercingetorix and Boudicca may think differently. Certainly Australian aborigines may object to being sidelined.<br>  <br>  It is strongly tempting to say Jews - and indeed for the majority of the last 2000 years this racial / religious group has probably been more consistently bullied by the rest of their native countries. <br>  <br>  However this is strongly biased towards the western European history where Christian-dominant nations have persecuted Jews until 1948 when the Islam-dominated Middle Eastern Nations took over. It ignores persecution of tribal/racial/religious groups in Africa, Asia, South America and Australia/NZ. It may well be that Christianity is just an oppressive religion and that its oppression of Judaism is actually greater than any other group but that is another conversation.<br>  <br>  Crucially, this ignores the one group of humanity that is persecuted in a very cross cultural manner - women. <br>  <br>  While some historical cultures have granted women position and authority close to being equal to men, these really are the exception. Even the Jews dont allow their women full equality...|`|rtqeG56Yaa	every race except the white race including white men. END OF STORY. it is very hard to measure the injustices committed upon, black people, jewish people and native indians, so it is very unfair to say which group has been persecuted the most- it is like an insult to the innocent ancestors who built this nation; blacks and native indians. again END OF STORY.|`|oXy5DDZcaa	The most persecuted people ever?

Sure, black people are famous for having been enslaved for centuries.  Gay people have been bashed since homo sapiens became a species.

GpcbuAfmaa	There is a girl I know who speaks really clearly and THINKS she speaks loudly but when she talks it's so quiet, it's like a whisper. You have to strain to hear what she's saying. It's actually quite ridiculous. When i'm in a conversation with her I say 'what' 'sorry?' 'pardon' 'say that again' 'excuse me' so many times that I'm blue in the face!! and I can tell it annoys her too even though she's the one whispering<br>  <br>  Maybe your just not talking loud enough?|`|bb06GQ5Paa	So many rude answers and in the etiquette section too.<br>  <br>  <br>  I know exactly what you are talking about.  They say what just for the sake of saying what.  It's almost like a habit.  I've come across people like that and once I realize what they are doing, I just stop or I say nevermind and they will go ahead and answer my question.  If you heard me the first time, why'd you ask me what I said?  Idiot.  Sometimes you come across children that do that alot.  They haven't been taught any better so maybe that's the excuse for these adults.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	Jeez Louise, what a bunch of rude, snippy little bitc**s we have here in the etiquette section today!<br>  This is a perfectly legitimate question, and it IS in the correct section!  I have run into the same thing with certain people I have met.  And they do it not only to me, but to everyone they talk to, so I know I don't have a problem being heard or understood.  One character I know even interrupts HIMSELF when he is speaking, to interject, "Huh?" in the middle of a sentence.<br>  I think it's kind of a mental hiccup that allows them to momentarily reboot their thought process, kind of like, "Ya know?", ya know?  There is no way to correct this bad habit in others, but to try and limit your conversations with them to one or two words at a time.|`|rThIVk2maa	"what?" and "huh?" are both too brusque and should be avoided. "Hm?" is slightly more polite, but to communicate properly, you should say "I'm sorry, could you repeat that?" in a pleasant tone of voice. <br>  <br>  Getting others to do this...well, good luck. You can always ALWAYS lead by example though. It's always surprising how much better I get treated when I talk to people, say a cashier, for example, as though that person actually deserved the courtesy of clear speaking.|`|u7LSohRyaa	I agree. My ex used to say that all the time. Most of the time I didn't even want to bother repeating myself since he had already cut me off mid-sentence. I really hate when people use 'what?" as a joke. Dude, not funny. Geeky! I really prefer, "I'm sorry but I didn't hear what you said" or "what do you mean?" That makes me less nervous and gives me time to collect my thoughts. 'What?' is a little vague.|`|hQWucH5uaa	It's "huh?" that gets me!|`|1JSblCBsaa	If people are constantly snapping "what" at you, and not only that, more than 1 person is constantly doing it, I think you'll find the problem is you, and not everyone else.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the reason people say "what" is because it is tiresome to say a whole sentence and it interupts the whole flow of conversation for them to say "say that again" over and over. They are probably saying "what" because it sounds weird to constantly be literally asking someone to repeat themselves. <br>  <br>  It does the same job. I think people who do that are fine as they are obviously into what you're saying rather than being a bit reserved and concerned about being overly polite and picking their words carefully.<br>  <br>  It also depends what sort of situation you're in when it happens (eg a noisy bar, a slow quiet conversation) how rude it may be but all in all I personally don't see a problem with it although I remember being corrected over it when I was young. I don't see how 1 word can be rude. I think it's the way it's said<br>  <br>  I personally find 'huh' bad because it's not even a word LOL and also have you never heard of the word pardon? That's usually the one people think is polite.|`|iP863XM6aa	I think you over react too much over the "what" situation. whenever i say what it cause i literally didnt hear what a person said. I find that Hmm, or huh is ruder cause that to me means they probably spaced out but even then, i wouldnt freak out over it.<br>  <br>  Relax... you may be "perfect" but the rest of the world isnt.|`|4TN6LSVQaa	you are funny. that's my take...<br>  <br>  no. the really annoying ppl are the ones that say "what?what?what?what?what?"   and they know exactly what you are saying/talking about.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	I think some people have Selective Hearing they hear when they want to & play they don't when it's not impotant to them & yes I agree it's rude when this happens to me I clam up then I get their attention it works|`|AA10104545	The polite response is "pardon me?" or "exscuse me?"...what? and huh? are incorrect...and rude.|`|OBwqjS8maa	I'm guilty of that sometimes, but most of the time I remember my manners and say "pardon"?|`|SC91Uwrhaa	RANTING!!!! <br>  <br>  .....you may have the right to post it, but we have the right to laugh at your for being an uptight weirdo!|`|08d3778f46ccb1088efa36be8edafa91aa	Has it occured to you that maybe these people have hearing problems?|`|WuhIoS1laa	Actually, I find "huh?" to be worse than "What?" <br>  <br>  'Huh' sounds more like a wordless grunt than an actual word. It sounds more like someone heard the words but is confused by what you said rather than asking you to repeat it. <br>  <br>  Politely, you should say "I'm sorry, but could you repeat that?". "Huh" is lower on the evolutionary scale than "What?"<br>  <br>  If you get a "what' every time you say something (and if they aren't just yanking your chain) then consider that you are doing something wrong. <br>  <br>  You might be too far away, speaking indistinctly, turned away, speaking while there is back ground noise, talking through an audio device with poor reception, or talking to them when their attention is focused on something else.  <br>  <br>  All of these things are very annoying to the listener because they are all within the control of the speaker to correct or time better. In short - make sure you aren't the one being lazy when you talk to them. <br>  <br>  I have a friend that I jokingly call Boomhauer (from King of the Hill). He mumbles his words out so fast, nobody can understand him. He thinks this is perfectly fine. Maybe he thinks it's funny. Maybe he doesn't realize that he's a speed mumbler, except we've all told him we can't understand him. <br>  <br>  In an informal setting, you get tired of saying "I'm sorry - could you please repeat that?" and just shorten it to "What?"|`|6OFHemITaa	Try to be patient with these people!  <br>  Many times people do not hear others speaking to them simply because of the voices in their own head.  I HATE when people say huh?, tho.  To me that sounds like they weren't even trying to listen in the first place.....<br>  And by the way, it wasn't a bad question, some people just think they are funny and some people just don't understand things that bother others.

AA11557192	When I make an accommodation for someone, it is just the right think to do.  Like giving your seat on the train to pregnant woman.<br>  <br>  However when we institutionalize it, it looses something.  And then there will come demands.  Stores near me have only one space for pregnant women.  What if three or four arrive at the same time?  Then we will need to have 6 spaces for them.  <br>  <br>  Add that to the 8 for handicapped.  Then other groups will feel they need special parking also.  I can easily see that we should have elderly parking.  I suspect there are other groups that feel they ned special parking too.<br>  <br>  Soon average people will not be able to park anywhere near the entrance.|`|URO3gDXcaa	i park there anyway.  if they want to complain i will claim discrimination.  we can't have kids.|`|AA11859794	Maybe pregnant women should not be going out shopping especially when they are in their 7, 8, 9th month along. Some women when they get to their 8th month can hardly walk. <br>  Those signs would annoy me too.  I have never seen them but that is so ridiculous. <br>  Some little kids don't like to walk far but maybe it is good for them.|`|6gthdHpnaa	They're okay. Parents and pregnant women should be able to park near the entrance, but I think they should just have one sign that describes all of those people, that way it wouldn't be so confusing.|`|AA11305474	I just saw such signs for the first time last weekend and think we are getting a little too ticky tacky.  I don't mind spaces designated for handicapped, but think these designated spaces are going too far.|`|vYAgIMLdaa	I don't agree with them. Handicapped spaces I can understand. The other folks are right: if you can't walk 100 feet, maybe you should have someone drop you off at the door while they park the car.

In German we don't use euphemisms for that place. We are happy to call it by its name "toilette" or a bit stronger "Klo" (not to be used in posh company). Waschraum could end you up in the laundryroom.<br>  It is more the act which is euphemised "ich muss mal fuer kleine Jungs/Maedchen" and lots of others I could thinks of but would not put down here.

Fortunately not all atheists are like that.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Actually, since there is no evidence, Occam's Razor says belief is unwarranted, so the statement "No deity created anything" is the only reasonable stance.|`|DQjAGWXQaa	It's hilarious because they're the only arguments I hear.|`|uD8d5V9Saa	Thank you for the blank statement Jake.|`|nEc0L0MRaa	Yes it does bug me, I seek more than one reference when I want to know something.

nQvcqVkNaa	The Jews never omitted YHWH from their Scriptures. They had developed a superstition regarding the utterance of God's name but they absolutely would never dare to remove His Holy name from their Scriptures. Their superstition about speaking God's name came from their being punished by Jehovah for their leaving Him and mixing pagan practices with their worship of Him. Instead of taking responsibility for their disobedience, they decreed that their punishment was because someone had taken His name in vain and so banned the utterance of Jehovah's name.<br>  <br>  Jesus and the apostles used his Almighty God and Father Jehovah's name. It is clearly stated by Jesus himself and of course, every time the apostles quoted the Hebrew Scriptures they would use Jehovah's name just as Jesus showed them to do by example.<br>  <br>  John 17:6; Jesus prayed to his God Jehovah "I have made your name known"<br>  <br>  Romans 10:13; Paul quotes the Hebrew Scriptures of Joel 2:32 where Jehovah's name was never removed by the Jews. Peter also quoted that Scripture at Acts 2:21, boldly proclaiming God's name as Jesus did. "everyone who calls upon the name of Jehovah will be saved"<br>  <br>  There are many other Scriptures as well which prove that it is vital to use God's name Jehovah. Here are but a few:<br>  Isaiah 12:4<br>  1 Chronicles 16:8<br>  Psalm 105:1<br>  <br>  As to there not being a J in ancient Hebrew; all Hebrew names beginning with a Y are translated into J in English. If you refuse to use the J then you must also call God's son Yhshua, for that is the name he was called when he was on earth.<br>  <br>  There has been much historical Bible study dedicated to why YHWH is not in the 4th century and later manuscripts that we have of the Christian Greek Scriptures. The Romans hated the Jews and when they took over "christianity" in the 4th century they attempted to make Jesus equal to his Almighty God and Father with their trinity doctrine while simultaneously trying to erase the name of Jehovah who they saw as the God of the Jews. Take a look at the following links for more info on this possibility and others.<br>  <br>  NOTE: the links below are from various sources and should only be referenced for their factual historic statements, not their personal opinionated doctrine.|`|sVyH0jTiaa	They removed God's name but I don't trust silver-tongued (Clergies).<br>  I only trust Jehovah , because I don't trust men that removed his name!<br>  I don't trust men teaching without reading the Bible!<br>  I only trust Jehovah's words, by reading his words.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Most of us are not Jewish.They don't follow all other Jewish traditions,so why cling to that ? Latin-America has no problem with it you can any Latino what God's name is and he 99% will say Jehova'. I have many translations of the Bible,but I don't like the new translations because they have deliberately taken the name out completely.|`|Xt9wIj4Iaa	While most bible translations contain some merit, one cannot trust a translation that alters the original text as much as those versions that leave out God's name.<br>  <br>  God's name was left out because of a Jewish tradition to not pronounce God's name. It started hundreds of years after the Hebrew Scriptures had been completed.<br>  <br>  It has no scriptural basis. It is only based on tradition. Jesus warned about such traditions.<br>  <br>  As for the claim that the Jews never removed God's name: 1) They removed it when reading the Scriptures aloud, replacing it with other words. 2) They remove it from their translations into other languages.<br>  <br>  As for the ridiculous debates about how God's name should be pronounced: 1) There is no scriptural basis for the belief that we must pronounce certain biblical words or names the way they were originally pronounced. 2) The study of ancient Hebrew shows that Hebrew pronunciation slowly changed over time. The earliest record of how Hebrew was pronounced is about a thousand years later than the completion of the Hebrew Bible. In other words, the exact ancient pronunciation of any Hebrew name/word is not known. So there is no point in arguing how it was pronounced. 3) God concerns himself with the "meaning" of the bible - how people live their lives. God is not concerned with technical details, such as the exact vocal intonation of ancient words. That is the realm of magic - something strictly forbidden in the scriptures.|`|FZM15NXtaa	Such a translation assumes that man knows better than God.  God put his name in there.  If a group of men take it out, they are disrespecting God.<br>  <br>  That makes their version useless.  The fundamental purpose of any Bible should be to reveal God according to his own self-revelation, which included his unique, personal Name.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	How can you trust any translation that is not the original writing word for word?  I think being human, there will always be an error.|`|4hsl2toNaa	I can't.   What else have they left out or twisted?|`|5aqYVyvAaa	Well, if people are gonna pick apart Jehovah...What about the translation of the name Jesus?<br>  <br>  The first letter in the name Yeshua ("Jesus") is the yod. Yod represents the "Y" sound in Hebrew. Many names in the Bible that begin with yod are mispronounced by English speakers because the yod in these names was transliterated in English Bibles with the letter "J" rather than "Y". This came about because in early English the letter "J" was pronounced the way we pronounce "Y" today. All proper names in the Old Testament were transliterated into English according to their Hebrew pronunciation via the Latin, but when English pronunciation shifted to what we know today, these transliterations were not altered. Thus, such Hebrew place names as ye-ru-sha-LA-yim, ye-ri-HO, and yar-DEN have become known to us as Jerusalem, Jericho, and Jordan; and Hebrew personal names such as yo-NA, yi-SHAI, and ye-SHU-a have become known to us as Jonah, Jesse, and Jesus. To further complicate matters, there was no letter "J" in the old English alphabet and the letter "I" was often used in its place. Often in early texts of the time, Jesus or Jerusalem would be spelled Iesus or Ierusalem.<br>  <br>  According to this we mispronounce Jesus along with Jehovah as well as many other names in the Bible.

qBOPQQQpaa	I identify with Buddhism, and it is not a religion but a philosophy of life. When you ponder things a little deeper than the print in the text or the words spoken, you get a glimpse that the meaning of life is to love to learn and learn to love, and that the living of life is time spent in a cosmic classroom, the place to learn the power of good and chose to be a soldier in the Legions of Light or the Army of Darkness. When the good lessons are taken to heart and understood then the next thing to happen is to be enlightened, then there follows graduation to a state of Nirvana and never having to return to a world of ignorance and pain ever again.   ...... peace to all sentient beings from a Buddhist|`|pqveENjUaa	Neo-shamanism. It make the most sense to me. Identifying with nature and the elements has been part of me since I was a child. My grandfather used to take me out into the local forests/swamps to explain how nature can control everything. He once took me outside while the edge of a hurricane was striking so that I could witness a small sample of the destructive power of nature, and the very next day (after the storm had subsided) he took me back outside to see the plants growing in the destruction, to teach me the healing properties of nature.

But I've been drawn to Paganism since childhood.|`|r6JskEtxaa	Christianity. I was one before I became atheist.|`|vmv1rP76aa	Several, actually: <br>  <br>  Judaism: I grew up around many Jewish kids in my school, and I've always felt a little something there. I guess maybe its how the faith survived, or possibly a past life as a Jew, who knows? I can certainly appreciate how well-equipped they are and despite accusations of them being "religious", they can tolerate other faiths and love thy neighbor. <br>  <br>  Catholicism: This specific branch of Christianity because I grew up with it, I was raised Catholic (baptized, communion), and while I don't agree with the Christian faith, I can certainly appreciate what many good Catholic laypeople and missionaries do for others. Also, many Catholics I've known are much nicer and less judgmental than Protestants. <br>  <br>  Wicca: I love the entire religion itself, how it encourages actively working with God rather than just praying and expecting a "sign from the sky", embracing that part of God within, how they bring the feminine principle to God, and their general reverence for nature and for taking care of the planet. <br>  <br>  Paganism: A lot of it just rings to me, I love the stories about the Old Gods and Goddesses, and how there are so many different blends and paths, from Druidism to Asatru, and how Paganism can easily coincide with another faith, such as Christopagan and the like (though some get offended with the notion, its still out there and generally more tolerant and reasonable). I also feel Paganism is most logical and reasonable to me (Neo-Paganism and Pantheism, to be specific). <br>  <br>  Shinto: Their appreciation for life and objects and the idea of everything, from the smallest grain of sand to a rock to even animals and humans, have a spirit, a soul, and a life force. Goes well with any belief system and just has a very peaceful way to it that I like.|`|ZaSiPFvtaa	Agnosticism is not a religion, so much as it is a position regarding religion.

If you're really worried about looking pale, try looking into differant sunless tanning products. Using one that only adds a little bit of a color change should look natural on you.<br>  <br>  Also, find colors of clothing that will compliment your skin tone.

It's about the only "religion" I can think of that has no rites, and doesn't deify anyone.|`|hj76FSKdaa	As far as religions based on the Bible, here’s one easy way to tell a cult.  A cult believes that anyone who is not a faithful member of their particular group will go to hell.  So cult members spend a lot of time trying to convert Christians to their group.  On the other hand, a member of an evangelical free church would not be especially concerned about converting a Baptist to his/her religion.  True, they would be some minor doctrinal differences, but no Baptist or E-Free person believes that membership in their denomination is required for eternal life.<br>  <br>  The sad thing is that most cults try to deny that they fit the above definition by making all sorts of specious arguments.  But in the end, it is well-known what they think.|`|EueaG0EBaa	They are all really cults.  The only difference if it is mainstream.  A cult is a group with beliefs that are uncommon.  So you better believe Christianity started as a cult.  As long as more people believe it, it is not a cult|`|Ve18FAnGaa	the difference between cults and religions (whether anyone wants to admit it or not) are simply the age, power, and popularity of the religion.|`|R5MXZ9FFaa	They all are.<br>  <br>  Religion is nothing more than a cult with political influence.|`|j5YwuVEIaa	Cults—What Are They?<br>  FEBRUARY 28, 1993—more than a hundred law-enforcement agents raided a compound of buildings housing dozens of men, women, and children. The object was to search for illegal weapons and to arrest a suspected criminal. The agents, however, were caught by surprise when a hail of bullets came flying toward them from inside the buildings. They returned the fire.<br>  This confrontation left ten dead and several wounded. During the following 50 days, hundreds of government agents laid siege to the compound with enough guns to wage a small war. The standoff ended in a showdown that left 86 dead, including at least 17 children.<br>  But who was the enemy? An army of drug-dealing mobsters? A guerrilla faction? No. As you may know, the “enemy” was a group of religious devotees, members of a cult. Their tragedy made an inconspicuous community on the plains of central Texas, U.S.A., the focus of international attention. The news media flooded the airwaves and the printed page with a barrage of reports, analyses, and comments on the dangers of fanatical cults.<br>  The public was reminded of previous instances in which cult members were led to death by their leaders: the 1969 Manson murders in California; the 1978 mass suicide of cult members in Jonestown, Guyana; the 1987 murder-suicide pact engineered by cult leader Park Soon-ja of Korea, which resulted in the death of 32 members. Significantly, most of these people claimed to be Christians and professed belief in the Bible.<br>  Understandably, many who respect the Bible as the Word of God are appalled at the brazen misuse of the Scriptures by these cults. As a result, over the years hundreds of organizations have been established for the purpose of monitoring cults and exposing their dangerous practices. Experts on cult behavior predict that the coming of a new millennium in a few years may trigger the proliferation of cults. One news magazine noted that according to anticult groups, there are thousands of cults “out there poised to snatch your body, control your mind, corrupt your soul. .?.?. Few are armed but most are considered dangerous. They’ll seduce you and fleece you, marry and bury you.”<br>  What Is a Cult?<br>  The term “cult” is used loosely by many who may not be fully aware of its connotations. To prevent confusion, some theologians actually avoid using the term.<br>  The World Book Encyclopedia explains that “traditionally, the term cult referred to any form of worship or ritual observance.” By that criterion, all religious organizations could be classified as cults. However, in general usage today, the word “cult” has a different meaning. The same encyclopedia notes that “since the mid-1900’s, publicity about cults has altered the meaning of the term. Today, the term is applied to groups that follow a living leader who promotes new and unorthodox doctrines and practices.”<br>  Endorsing the popular usage of the term, Newsweek magazine explains that cults “are normally small, fringe groups whose members derive their identity and purpose from a single, charismatic individual.” Similarly, Asiaweek magazine notes that “the term [cult] itself is vague, but it usually denotes a new religious creed built around a charismatic leader, who often proclaims himself to be the personification of God.”<br>  The language used in a joint resolution of the 100th Congress of the State of Maryland, U.S.A., also conveys the derogatory connotation of the term cult. The resolution states that “a cult is a group or movement exhibiting excessive devotion to a person or idea and employing unethically manipulative techniques of persuasion and control to advance the goals of its leaders.”<br>  Clearly, cults are generally understood to be religious groups with radical views and practices that clash with what is accepted today as normal social behavior. Usually they conduct their religious activities in secrecy. Many of these cultic groups actually isolate themselves in communes. Their devotion to a self-proclaimed human leader is likely to be unconditional and exclusive. Often these leaders boast of having been divinely chosen or even of being themselves divine in nature.<br>  Occasionally, anticult organizations and the media have referred to Jehovah’s Witnesses as a cult. A number of recent newspaper articles lump the Witnesses with religious groups known for their questionable practices. But would it be accurate to refer to Jehovah’s Witnesses as a small fringe religious group? Cult members often isolate themselves from friends, family, and even society in general. Is that the case with Jehovah’s Witnesses? Are the Witnesses using deceptive and unethical techniques to recruit members?<br>  Cult leaders are known to use manipulative methods to control the minds of their followers. Is there any evidence that Jehovah’s Witnesses do this? Is their worship cloaked in secrecy? Are they following and venerating a human leader? Pointedly, are Jehovah’s Witnesses a cult?|`|5aqYVyvAaa	Great question you get a star!!! Here is the definition of a cult. <br>  <br>  In our modern world of the new millennium, the word "cult" has become largely overused and is now a catch-all for any group, religion or lifestyle which someone doesn't understand, or with which they happen to disagree. This is a dangerous trend, as many of the organizations labeled a cult by dissidents are truly legitimate groups. Once the taint of the term "cult" is applied to a particular group, it is often difficult to change that image to the public.<br>  <br>  To avoid careless labeling which could be harmful to a group and its adherents, it is important to know just exactly what a cult is, and how it is defined. A cult, by modern standards, is any group that incorporates mind control to deceive, influence and govern its followers. Although most people think of cults as being religious, they can also be found in political, athletic, philosophical, racial or psychotherapeutic arenas.<br>  <br>  The mind control, or brainwashing, exerted by cults often take the form of at least several of the following elements:<br>  <br>  A totalitarian control over the lifestyle and time of its members - Many cults tend to dictate exactly what its followers should read, eat, how and with whom they should spend their time, and even what they should do in off hours. This totalitarian control is necessary for the leaders to indoctrinate the followers in everything they do, and is also an attempt to separate them from anything not associated with the cult. This is why cults often live together in groups.<br>  <br>  A charismatic, self-appointed leader with complete authority - Cult members are taught not to question the teachings, practices, or ideas of the leader. Many cult leaders truly are charismatic people, and are able to influence people to believe them. It is common that a cult member is not told everything up front when joining the group, but that they are taught increasingly controlling ideas and teachings as they go. In the case of some of the more well-publicized cults that have come and gone, it is also common that the leader's ideas and demands evolve over time, becoming increasingly controlling and restrictive. One very clear identifying element dealing with the leader of a cult is that the leader will always focus the attention and veneration of the members upon himself or herself. At the heart of a cult usually lies a very self-centered and self-seeking person.<br>  <br>  A focus on withholding truth from non-members - Many cults teach their followers to be completely open and truthful within the group, while at the same time they are encouraged to be secretive and evasive when questioned by people outside of the group. This is another form of mind control-instilling guilt in the members if they hold anything back within the group. The members are taught that outsiders wouldn't understand or that they would only make fun of the ideas and practices and requirements for living within the group. Only specially-commissioned members are appointed to recruit members from outside. New members are usually encouraged to keep silent or even lie, especially to their families and close friends.<br>  <br>  The three elements listed above are very successful ways to create a group mentality, an us-against-them way of looking at things. This is essential for any cult that wants to keep its members. The more afraid of the outside world the members become, the more strongly and faithfully they will keep within the safe fold of the cult.<br>  <br>  From this definition a lot of Christian religions and religions in general can be considered a cult, as well as anyone who has a group with strong ideas about something. <br>  <br>  I won't say any specific groups of religions who are and who are not cults because everyone thinks that everyone else except their religion is a cult and I don't want to ruffle feathers.<br>  <br>  But here is some food for thought. <br>  James 2:26 says faith without works is dead<br>  <br>  Who is following the Bible to the best of their ability? The Bible says just because you have faith doesn't mean you'll make it. You have to live your life according to the Bible everyday. Which religion does the best job?<br>  <br>  The Bible says at Matt. 7:13-14 go thru the narrow gate because broad and spacious is the one leading to destruction and many are the ones going thru it, where as cramped and narrow is the road leading to life and few are the ones finding it.<br>  <br>  So yes 1000's of religions are saying the same thing but only a few are right according to the Bible. So again who is following the Bible the best?<br>  <br>  Here's another thing for you. John 15:17-21 Jesus said that the world hated him and will persecute him and they will hate and persecute his true followers.<br>  <br>  Which religion is hated the most? Which religion is it that when someone says they've changed their faith it's the ONLY one that is not acceptable? Which religion is it when people ask questions they will listen until they find out what faith you are?|`|pqveENjUaa	To me it only becomes a cult when it involves social isolation or harm to the members. Excommunication for instance, is a signal of cult potential. But where a certain religion that I'm not going to name for honest fear that it will find a way to torture me doesn't allow it's members to associate with even their family members is DEFINITELY a cult. Can anyone think of it? The one with all the powerful lawyers? The one that has been known to trump up so many law charges against you simply for disagreeing with them that you have to spend almost literally every day of the work week in court defending yourself to the point where you can't make any money, lose your job, your house, and commit suicide? It's out there. I'm just not going to name it.

It's also no good if you want conversational fluency. It's more suited towards vocabulary building.<br>  <br>  Try Pimsleur. It's a great start towards conversational fluency.

XTDeAfTqaa	Rules are rules, young lady. They are put in place for a reason. I'll bet you won't be tardy again will you?<br>  You could always use that detention time to study your English since you will need to talk to your Principal not your priciple. ;~)|`|bb06GQ5Paa	I agree with you.  A thief won't get the same punishment as a serial murderer.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Bring a note from your mother. And it is PRINCIPAL not principle. Learn the difference.|`|T6wCgLSvaa	Eh... I'm kind of split down the middle on this.<br>  <br>  Yes, I agree that rules are rules...<br>  <br>  But I also think that's the stupidest school rule I've ever heard. <br>  With that kind of logic, teenagers might be motivated to skip MORE.<br>  If your gonna get the same punishment (regardless of how late you are), then why even bother going to class? lol if they had that rule in my school, NOBODY would be in class... seriously.<br>  <br>  I also think that some of the people on here are exagerrating about how if you're late once, then you will automatically be fired. Yes, I DO agree that the responsibilites in the real world are MUCH greater than in school, but I don't think they're that harsh. Of course, this might depend on what job you have, and how great your responsibilities are, but my mom has been late to work a few times (not very many, but a few), and they didn't just fire her on the spot.<br>  <br>  I think you should have a talk to your principal in an mature, adult manner to see if he can compromise with you.<br>  <br>  Also keep in mind, however, that **** happens... and people won't always do what's fair. Sometimes you just have to suck it up.|`|rThIVk2maa	Well, the punishment is fair to all, anyone who violates the rule gets the same treatment.<br>  <br>  This is good preparation for later in life. For example, when you don't show up to your job on time, you could lose it, or be docked pay. <br>  <br>  Half an hour detention is not the end of the world and is far milder than what you'll face once you graduate, so just make it a point to be there as early as you can, no matter how unfair this may seem. I know it sucks, but just wait until your paycheck hits your bank account "just a little" overdrawn. <br>  <br>  No mercy out there my friend, good to learn that now.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	Let me begin by saying that I sympathize with your displeasure, and I believe that you should take your argument to the principal.  That is only fair.<br>  However, a rule is a rule, and if it is applied equally to all, then it is a fair rule. You knew in advance the potential punishment for being late, and while it was not your fault, you were still late.  Sometimes things happen beyond our control but we still have to suffer the consequences.  As someone else pointed out, if your bank account was "only $5. overdrawn", you would still be held accountable.  Likewise, if you were driving "only 5 miles per hour" over the speed limit, or if you were "only 5 days late" paying the electric bill.   A boundary is a boundary, and unless there is a grace period or some leeway or a justifiable excuse, you will be held responsible, whether it is really fair or not.<br>  Good luck with the principal; maybe you can get the rule altered.|`|gNomUwkzaa	Avoid this in future by getting to school yourself<br>  <br>  walk<br>  cycle<br>  learn to drive if you are old enough<br>  get a bus<br>  train<br>  etc...<br>  <br>  If you are an adult you'll stop depending on your parents.|`|AA12146958	You broke the rule and why is irrelevant. You want to be treated with respect then earn it by obeying the rules.|`|fHpPgMlZaa	First learn how to spell principal.<br>  <br>  You were late and suffered the consequences.I don't see the big deal.|`|3kboRgkzaa	I agree with you completely! Your principal should listen to your side of the story, not just the fact that you were late to school. I also agree that punishments should be given out based upon the degree of your "crime". Talk to your parents about it if something like that happens again since the principal may pay more attention to thier word than yours.|`|AA11071040	I am sure this is not what you want to hear, but the rules are there to help you to become more responsible.  Do you think if your mom would have given you a note to excuse your tardiness it would have made a difference?  Once you get into the real world excuses are just excuses, you don't get detention, you get written up and fired.  While it isn't fair that you would get the same punishment for being 5 minutes late as someone that skipped first period (are you sure about that?) late is late.  So to be honest, I don't think you have much of an argument.  If you want to be treated like an honest adult, than act like one, take your punishment and don't be late again.|`|WuhIoS1laa	That was well thought out argument - I agree. <br>  <br>  Under their rules, if you are going to be five minutes late might as well not rush. You could miss the first half hour and it would be the same detention. <br>  <br>  They might be able to save some administrative effort and time by reducing the number of people given detention if they just get warnings until a pattern of lateness is clear. And it would be fairer.<br>  <br>  I recall when I was a kid you weren't late in my school until your name was called for roll call. Different times, different schools, different rules. <br>  <br>  I think they will probably give some lame 'well those are the rules' responses, but I think it's worth a try.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|i6tyscumaa	I'd have got my mum to ring the school.<br>  If it was a family thing (ie your brother getting dropped off) obviously it's not your fault.<br>  However, its a common excuse to use, i understand why they don't belive you<br>  If a parent rings and camly explains, they should lift the punishment surely? If they don't, thats CERTAINLY out of order, i mean, it wasn't your fault!<br>  <br>  I understand why your annoyed. Teachers sometimes let all that power go to their heads, especially in my school :|<br>  <br>  I don't want to sound annoying, but try not to let it get you down! <br>  Good Luck!xx

I am sure there are homes and facilities for people like him, what happens when the stray animals finish lol I am sure your dog maybe his next menu..|`|zlHgIltOaa	No. Some of those "stray" animals could be lost pets.

If you see him doing it again then call the cops.|`|sy7ytm9Kaa	While I am not familiar with the law concerning the consumption of strays, how about you and your dog bring him some food and make friends?   He wouldn't eat the animals if he had food.  He wouldn't eat dog if he met him and got to know the both of you (hopefully!).|`|M8X0dIOZaa	No, he is not allowed to hunt anything inside city limits. Stray animals can be diseased, can have rabies, that is why it is against the law, even if he's homeless. He can go to the local shelter for food or go to a city that has one.
eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|vhlORK4Waa	Victoria Marie<br>  <br>  I am sorry to break the news to you, but vampires as you imagine them do not exist.

You cannot become a physical vampire (fangs, pale skin, need for blood for survival). You can ONLY assume the physicality of a vampire by perhaps buying a set of fale teeth that resemble fangs, painting your face pale, and drinking blood (although good luck finding a donor). <br>  <br>  Vampires, while interesting, are not real. They were made up a long time ago and grew into the popularity they are in today.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Mr Scary - your proof that vamipres exist is what you saw in a movie?? That's like saying that all witches practice the way you see in "The Craft". <br>  <br>  I don't understand why people want to be vampires anyways...eventually you will want to die, living forever would suck after about another 100 years.|`|d9d7dbffacb9c5256ef7afd69e6023b6aa	If you'd read vampire books too, then you would have a fairly good idea of what is commonly accepted as "the way" of being turned into a vampire.<br>  <br>  It comes down to about the same thing as faster than light space travel or 'mind powers'. It is commonly accepted in fiction, because it can be imagined, and is a 'cool' concept. It doesn't make it any more real, though.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	.No man or women can become a Vampire no matter what .it does not excites in our world. it is only a myth a story made up in movies.

(The ending scene  was very romantical and touching I think.)- If you know that movie you probably know that vampires have put in a lot of efforts for making humans do believe as they are just nightmare creatures. <br>  <br>  So, with other word it can be pretty though to meet a vampire on the street. <br>  <br>  However, I know that there are people on MySpace for example that claims to be vampires. If you just promise to be extremely careful when you approach them I am pretty sure that they can answer your questions about becoming one.<br>  <br>  For my own part (and I have spoken with at least one person claiming to be a vampire) the main is to never harm another human being. Just to have fun and enjoy the life safe and happy is enough for getting the right to call yourself a vampire.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately I have earned the right to call myself Mr Scary Scarecrow instead.|`|WuhIoS1laa	You don't.

Is it possibly so you can be Bella and marry Edward someday?  Because I can tell you – vampire or no, that will never happen, and honestly you don’t want it to happen.  <br>  <br>  Second – it is very unlikely that vampires exist.  I only say this because I have no proof either way – and neither do you.  People saying their vampires doesn’t mean they are.  I can say I’m a vampire a million times a day and it still won’t make it true.  <br>  <br>  Just be happy with what you’ve been given – a mortal life.  Now make the most of it, and try to forget about Edward – because trust me, he doesn’t exist in human OR vampire form.<br>  <br>  Sorry :( I know it sucks but it's best to move on and forget about it.|`|Ux9lRTaSaa	oh hay i'm uh vampyre too<br>  i will mak u becom wun.<br>  <br>  Get real.<br>  Vampires are NOT real, they never have been, and never will be.<br>  Where's your proof they exist?<br>  You can't prove vampires are real anymore than I can prove ghosts are real.|`|AA11138696	You cannot become a vampire because they do not exist
2xaVpnNNaa	i think this is a bad direction society is coming to because, PC can only do so much. i read Fahrenheit  451....we dont want those kind of societies. but we are headed that way. <br>  <br>  the problem with being PC is, that, you seriously can not avoid insulting someone. a person can turn ANYTHING into an insult.<br>  <br>  so how can you really be PC???? why go out of your way, to keep from insulting someone, who is likely to be offended by anything you say anyways??|`|cLGmnUcgaa	yes, it seems like it has. what happened to the days of saying what you think and feel and the other people actually liking the fact that you said it because you were brave to do it?! now if even one person slips with ONE wrong word, everyone goes a little nuts. we all have different opinions, and that is NEVER going to change, no matter how bad we want it to. but i agree, its not one race one religion one stereotype, its a lot of them!  i think it is an unhappy direction we r heading.  im young, and in school when a teacher is saying something or teaching us something(which is their job) someone will spill out the words "well thats racist!!" even if it isnt even near racism. so my question is whats going to happen next?|`|pDmTRG82aa	yes and while some people get all sensitive some people act fake just to get along
pDmTRG82aa	good question. kind of for the same reason why at funerals they only say the good things about eh dead person. but I agree, unless the negative things are discussed, they will remain that way. now if people acknowledge the negative things then maybe something will be done about it.<br>  <br>  but yeah on this section if you're gonna ask about any stereotype or any tendency in any race, you're bound to have at least one person calling you racist.<br>  <br>  about the flaw. Im hispanic(well its not considered a race but its used on appliations so I'll go with it. and I am mexican btw)<br>  <br>  these are some negative tendencies Ive seen in people of my race in the US<br>  -many tend to get involved in gangs<br>  -do horrible in school<br>  -some expect a person to understand them completely when theyre trying to speak english. not realizing that its their english thats holding them back<br>  -excessive drinking at times.<br>  -many are too catholically brainwashed, few like me are atheists. but many are highly religious and that can sometimes affect their judgment<br>  -and having way too many kids. 2 should be the max. 3 and above is just way too much|`|NAL9SZuXaa	because there isnt an answer to thoes kind of questions...i would say, most of the questions asked (negative questions) are moot questions, which means that they can go on, & on, & on with no final answer (except an irate/insulted individual)<br>  <br>  *believe it or not, some people are sensative to certain topics & feel the need to say something in the name of their race...no one wants to feel like they are the worst of the worst<br>  <br>  *i dont agree with belittling oneself (because we have enough of that going around)....i feel that it is best to be happy with what makes you special than what makes you scum|`|HLqzrBNmaa	Its political correctness and its what's wrong with USA to some extent. I notice its more permitable to target white people though.|`|pfke6Jieaa	oh they are not hiding the negatives in my race trust me. but they also never show any good things from it. all people get stereotyped and it usually in a negative sense. no one is covered from them.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	White- lots of serial killers and pedophiles are white.<br>  <br>  But you can't say these things about minority races because they are considered racist and stereotypical. Stereotypical...yes; racist...not if you are pointing out facts.|`|IwqTI7Rfaa	A lot of Caucasians tend to be in denial about what black people or native americans or any other race has been through in history.  Maybe they are ashamed, or uncomfortable about it but a lot of them say "I understand..." when we can never understand.  We can try to understand, but we can't.  And I am a caucasian, and though I feel mistreatment (understatement) of how slaves, blacks, and "minorities" have been treated (and still are) is unjust, it is not my fault, and I don't deserve any of the hostility I sometimes get for being white.  The flaw in me is I am sometimes afraid to voice this, for fear of starting a fight.  This is a flaw, because if things are not out in the open, it shows I don't know how to relate to other races-when I like to tell myself I have no prejudices.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	The reason why we can't talk about the negative side was well explained by Attorney General Eric Holder when he called us a "nation of cowards".  Cowardly people are unable to talk about their races' downsides.
Zexhg9Lbaa	Look at the opal's answer. What is he saying? Feeding the world? Wow, just a minute. Who created this terrorists? Who gave them guns and rockets? Who is extreminating into other countries for their resources, who?   <br>  Don't be so smart pal. Economic  slowdown who created it? Some stupid american banks.|`|AMYzmL06aa	As an american, I recognize that we probably do come off as far less intelligent because in some ways, some of us are. Unlike other countries, education isn't as high in value to us. We don't learn two languages growing up, we don't always go into computer or medical science fields, but, in other ways, that doesn't make us less intelligent as a people. This is biasing; in common society, the lack of skills is considered less intelligent, but as pointed out, it is an opinion.|`|QFLtTeKEaa	Well, I traveled a lot and most of my close friends are foreigners.  Do we "come across" as unintelligent.  Yes, it's true.<br>  <br>  However, I think there are unrealistic expectations for the population of a country with our type of wealth and power and we tend to focus on the foreigners who are translated online or tv, who are the more educated in their countries while we see the average Americans on our own media.  <br>  <br>  By the way, it's spelled "too insulted."  Please don't be insulted, but our standards of education are lower than they should be.|`|WKsGpvEIaa	No, it's not just you.  The vast majority of Americans are fat, lazy, and a waste of resources.  I'm from San Diego, CA originally, been to Iraq, served 5 years in the military, and been through a lot of stuff.  Having said that, I currently live in Ohio.  Living here has given me an obvious "superiority" complex.  Small town living and close knit breeding habits seems to dilute the gene pool and produce useless examples of human life.  There is a reason this country is ran by a select few people, because the rest of them are to lazy, stupid, or unmotivated to go out and do something with themselves.|`|tuko08W3aa	it just depends on who your hanging around with I meet pretty much different people and only associate with ones I like but if you are hanging around idiots you would probably notice those the most so what does that say about you?|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I live in Ohio. I just wanted to say that because another person said they are living in Ohio too right now. <br>  <br>  Anyway, I would not say Americans are less intelligent. I would say, however, that they are not as intellectually stimulated as other cultures. For example, many Americans have absolutely no interest in politics, current events, foreign affairs, and foreign languages! It seems to me many are more interested in celebrities and material goods. We're in a recession and people are complaining that they can only buy the things they NEED. That tells you how materialistic our people are. At least we can still eat. Anyway, I think it is just because of lack of interest.<br>  <br>  Not all Americans of course.|`|4MLtp9g1aa	Yeah.....it is just you.|`|vYAgIMLdaa	I am not from the USA but travel there a lot and lived there for a few years. The people are not less intelligent, just less educated as to the ways and events in the rest of the world. They don't seem interested in foreign cultures or international affairs. This does not apply to all and I hope this doesn't offend anyone. Unfortunately the younger generation is headed in the wrong direction: being more materialistic and self-centred, so it will only get worse.|`|GPznIhzMaa	I'm American and I agree. There are very few well-rounded people. A lot of Americans are self-absorbed and materialistic.|`|T588vfJDaa	No me too, most Europeans think so actually|`|HQKuzxulaa	I'm afraid you are correct.
wwzej6rvaa	Meine Ferien<br>  <br>  In diesem Jahr in den Winterferien war ich sehr freundlich, darum hat mir mein Vater eines Tages ein Flugzeugticket nach Schweden gekauft. Das war meine erste Reise mit einem Flugzeug.<br>  Wir standen um 6 Uhr auf, da unser Flieger um 9 Uhr starten sollte und wir zum Flughafen eine Stunde mit dem Bus fahren mussten.<br>  Ich habe viele Sachen eingepackt: Waschzeug, Zahnbürste, Haargl?tter, Papier, Bleistift, meinen Laptop, den Walkman und viele Bücher, die ich noch nicht gelesen habe. Ich werde eine/-n Fotoapparat // Fotokamera mitnehmen.<br>  Aber, die Ferien waren sehr toll! Mein Vater und ich sind in viele Klamottenl?den gegangen. Au?erdem gingen wir in die Oper und h?rten uns "La Traviata" an. Das war mein erster Opernbesuch, genauso wie mein erster Flug mit einem Flugzeug. Jetzt wei? ich wirklich, was eine Oper ist und dass es sehr sch?n ist. Ich habe das erste Mal in Schweden K?sekuchen gegessen, bin  mit der Metro gefahren und im Hotel übernachtet. So viel zu meinen 'ersten Aktivit?ten'... sch?n, oder?<br>  Dann habe ich zwei Freunde in Schweden kennen gelernt. Sie hei?en Ewa & Peter. Sie haben uns zu sich nach Hause eingeladen, um mit ihnen Sylvester & Neujahr zu feiern. Es war sehr lustig, wahrscheinlich das lustigste Neujahr überhaupt. Es kann gut sein, dass es die lustigsten Ferien in meinem Leben waren!<br>  Ich hoffe, dass ich wieder nach Schweden reisen kann!

664ef7ac282ab7a5fe638caafbfb05b3aa	The definition of "rich" depends on who is talking and what they think they can get away with.  For example July 13, 1992 President Clinton said that he would only increase the tax on rich people -- people whose income was above $200,000.  However, in reality he pushed through a tax increase of 36% on all families that make $140,000 or more and individuals that make $115,000 or more.  Hmm ... so in that case it looks like rich people begin at $115,000 if you are single.<br>  <br>  Now it gets even more complicated for President Obama when he publicly stated that anyone making $250,000 or more are rich.  He also said he would only tax the rich.  However, in reality part of the stimulus plan that "gives" money to states requires an increase in unemployment benefits.  Those benefits do not come out of thin air but have to be paid for.  If the states use that stimulus money, they will have to raise taxes on people that work in their state.  So since President Obama said there would only be tax increases for the rich, his definition in this case must be anyone with a job.<br>  <br>  A few years ago, we had a governor (Missouri) that ran on the promise of only taxing the rich (obviously a popular campaign slogan).  While in office, he increased the state gas tax.  So in this case anyone that buys gasoline or anyone that rides a bus or anyone that uses products that had to be hauled using gas must be rich.  That would make everyone in the whole state rich.<br>  <br>  Wow, we are really lucky that the fact we live in Missouri makes us rich (at least in politician's minds).<br>  <br>  Concerning your second question about whether it is wrong to be rich, no.  Most of the people that I know that I would consider to be rich had to work VERY hard to get to that point in their lives.  They sacrificed a lot for their money, oftentimes (but not always) including the love of their families.  Is it the government's responsibility to punish people that want to work hard and get ahead in life?  Are we all supposed to be robots putting forth as little effort as possible so we can all be average like the majority in the former USSR?  ... of course no -- we all benefit from other peoples hard work -- there are jobs created and we have higher standards of living.<br>  <br>  In America ANYONE can do well financially if you want to put in the hard work.  I would say the poorer you are, the more the opportunities (college money & preferred hiring statuses), but you still have to work hard after you get into college -- you still have to work hard after you get the job.  I can speak with authority on this because I am one of the people who have done this.<br>  <br>  Think about it.  Research it.  Figure it out.|`|F9EvPa1Uaa	i think you have to make an amount of money, a year, like $90,000 an year and keep saving. Well i dont think rich people are rich while others are poor becuase rich people just saved their money, invest, got a good job, and work hard for it, and had certain goals.|`|PCpC4iS1aa	100 million-100 billion|`|QFLtTeKEaa	I'd be feeling rich if I had a million dollars, but I'd be feeling pretty rich if I had $500, 000 in the bank actually.<br>  <br>  Actually, I live in a house that's worth $500, 000 and sometimes that alone makes me feel rich, but it is all relative as it's not my house.<br>  <br>  I have an idea, let's all donate $5 to me and we keep going until the majority of people asked believe I'm rich ;).|`|Zexhg9Lbaa	More than poor, or maybe couple million dollar.|`|u93oneUXaa	It's all relative.|`|LHnVjJqsaa	just more than the average middle class person. And the second question depends on how those people treat poor people and what country you are in. I believe in America a lot of rich people (besides talentless celebreties, not all celebs just ones with no talent, like Paris Hilton) have worked hard. Paris Hilton's parents worked hard but she doesnt so yeah shes pretty much a selfish glutton. No im not keying in on her for any other reason than the fact that she and her family are a perfect example|`|cDZJgM4jaa	well u have to be upper class but idk the dollar ammount... <br>  no it isn't bad for people to be rich unless they hoard their money. <br>  If you have a little extra you should give to someone who needs it more than you do!|`|AMYzmL06aa	enough to sustain a high life style.rich people aren't wrong for being rich,chances are, they had to work their way to the top like everyone else.
AA11432517	Curse away,"witch". I thought you claimed in another question that you USED to be a witch, but gave it up and now you want to know what the principles of "witchery" are. That doesn't inspire any confidence that you are what you claim to be. Ghosts do not "stalk" you, that's bad horror flix stuff. You do not "combine powers" with a ghost, they don't have any "powers", and they really don't care much about you. And is that a "paranormal" ghost as opposed to a "normal" ghost? As I said, curse away if you think I've said something "bad", but it sounds more like "truth" to me.|`|Fk9RN6taaa	No.<br>  <br>  The ghost is haunting you because you can't spell properly, 4real.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	"combine powers"? <br>  <br>  Um, ghosts don't have "powers" - in fact, they need to draw on energy from their surroundings if they wish to manifest a sound, scent or apparition in attempt to communicate with the living.  Ghosts do not belong here - they need to "cross over", it is not good for their souls to not be at rest, and it is not good for the living when ghosts are around because, even if they mean no harm, they can wreak havoc in our lives by trying to draw energy from us and our surroundings.  <br>  <br>  There is no way a ghost can help you become an "extraordinary" witch - that is solely up to you.  Start with focusing on your education - after all, witchcraft is known by some as "the craft of the wise."|`|M8X0dIOZaa	They are more powerful than you. They may not want you to believe it because they like to trap people by trying to make them think they can be powerful themselves. Threatening people isn't going to make you extraordinary in any way either. Grow up. And it's not "hu" it's "who." Maybe try getting through grade school... high school... college at least, before you start dreaming of being a great witch.|`|jKyoKfnoaa	You aren't a witch - you're a wannabe.|`|vhlORK4Waa	I won't post something bad, but I would ask you to consider what you've written?<br>  <br>  As I just wrote on another question, witchcraft is a practice that can be utilised by those of many faiths and none at all.<br>  <br>  It is not a case of reading out of the latest teen love spell book, or lighting candles in your bedroom.<br>  <br>  First of all why do think you're a witch?  Because you practice witchcraft or magic? Why do you do that? What do you want to gain - there is an element of ethics involved in witchcraft if you follow what might be termed a religious witchcraft path.   People spend a lifetime of hard work, dedication and self analysis learning to utilise natural forces - and I am sorry, but ghostly energies aren't one of them. <br>  <br>  There's an adage in Wicca, if that which you seek you find not within, then you will never find it without. Simply put, where does the power come from - it comes from within - and that takes work, not mucking about with some potential otherwordly spirit  - who knows what it is - imo anyway!<br>  <br>  If you are serious about learning about magic, then please stop threatening people, your post is bound to attract precisely the kind of answer that you are expecting, I have endeavoured to be honest and give you the benefit of 20 years experience of witchcraft. Now you might say I amn't much of a witch, as I don't do much magic  -  remember this well - the more you learn, the less you know, and the more you realise that the fabric of reality does not actually require yanking. Let things work out on their own.<br>  <br>  I am sorry if I haven't told you what you wanted to hear, I am trying to help.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you should focus more on ceremonial magic if you want to dabble with external energies in this way - look up the O.T.O, or the Thelemites. There is training, but it might be your thing?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.oto-uk.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oto-uk.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.oto-usa.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oto-usa.org/</a><br>  <br>  Halcon|`|ZtHKL257aa	humm... pretty sure I've answered you before...<br>  <br>  Ghosts, although they may be real, are not something you can manipulate like a living thing. Sure you should fear them, they know many things you would not dare to dream of, and never, ever, talk about "absorbing" their... well... whatever you call it... Although I don't believe the ordinary spirit would be able to harm such a powerful witch as you yourself claim to be (...) they might have allies that actually do know what they are talking about, and I daresay you don't want to cross seers..<br>  <br>  But, just so you don't curse my weak, human neck into oblivion, a square room, empty of course for your convenience, with a candle in every corner and a bottle ( better if you had a hollow bone, but a bottle will do ) with something to close it afterward in the middle of the room. Then you walk around the room chanting the ancient Icelandic ghost trapping spell ( we are kind of experts in this field... ) "ég er ekki alveg í lagi" ( pronounced "yehch-ehr-ehckih-ahlvehch-e-lahchih" ), and I promise you, the ghost will not want to see you ever again!|`|T5a73kI2aa	You've been watching too many movies or playing too many role playing games.

You might need to want until you are 18 and move into a larger city.  SF is a great place to live.  They have groups and people that do this all the time.

Try to work hard in high school and get a scholarship to a larger college.  CA is very open about items like this in the University system.  The below web sites might have some one that would be willing to email with you or talk to you.  <br>  <br>  I don't have feelings like this so I am not the correct person to give you more information but I have had a lot of friends that were gay or other things which society does not care for.  They basically said that high school was hell but they stated that they were so much happier when they left their small towns and move to CA (I'm from CA).  Each had their own greifs but they all said that they just wished that they know that they were not alone in their feelings.  And you are not alone.  You will survive but moving to a city that is bigger is your best bet.  But in the time that you have left in your small town, try and work on your school and career chooses.  You can only do what you can do with the limitations of you current life.  Also, look up the history of gays and transgender in the library.  The more you know, the better you will do.  <br>  <br>  For Hollaween, go to the good will and pick a few out fits and then put them in your room and were them when people are not around.  But see what information you can find on the internet and the library.|`|AA0MuMt3aa	It's just how you are, and what you choose to be.<br>  Do as you want and what you think is right.

My kids have benefited greatly by reading this book. I can send you one if you would like for free. spreadingoodnews@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  First, PRAY to God to help you to find the means to avoid this behavior which he condenms.

KEEP PRAYING<br>  <br>  Chapter?28<br>  How Can I Avoid Homosexuality?<br>  “During my teens I struggled with an attraction to other males. Deep down, I knew those thoughts weren’t normal.”—Olef.<br>  “My girlfriend and I kissed once or twice. Since I still liked boys, I wondered if I might be bisexual.”—Sarah.<br>  FEW would deny that homosexuality is talked about more openly today than it was several decades ago. And just try to say that you disapprove of it! Likely, you will be bombarded with criticism. Says 16-year-old Amy, “One girl told me that I must be prejudiced against people of other races, because my opinion of homosexuality amounted to the same thing—prejudice!”<br>  Today’s permissive attitudes have prompted a number of youths to experiment with same-sex relationships. “Many girls in my school claim to be either lesbian, bisexual, or ‘bi-curious,’” says 15-year-old Becky. Christa, 18, finds the situation similar at her school. “Two classmates have actually propositioned me,” she says. “One wrote me a note asking if I wanted to see what it was like to be with a girl.”<br>  With same-sex relationships being touted so openly, you may begin to wonder: ‘Is homosexuality really that bad? What if I’m attracted to someone of my sex? Does that mean I’m gay?’<br>  How Does God View Homosexuality?<br>  Today, many people—even some clergymen—soft-pedal the issue of homosexuality. Yet, God’s Word, the Bible, leaves no room for confusion. It tells us that Jehovah God made man and woman and that he purposed for sexual desires to be fulfilled only between a husband and a wife. (Genesis 1:27, 28; 2:24) It comes as no surprise, then, that the Bible condemns homosexual acts.—Romans 1:26,?27.<br>  Some would say that God’s Word is out-of-date. But why, do you think, are they so quick to make that claim? Could it be because the Bible’s view conflicts with their own? Many reject God’s Word simply because it teaches something different from what they want to believe. That view is biased, though, and we should rise above such closed-minded thinking!<br>  But what if you feel attracted to a member of the same sex? Does this automatically mean that you’re a homosexual? No. Remember, you’re in “the bloom of youth,” a period when you’re subject to involuntary sexual arousal. (1?Corinthians 7:36) If at times you feel an attraction to a member of the same sex, be assured that this doesn’t mean that you’re gay. Such inclinations usually fade with time. Meanwhile, you must keep from getting involved in homosexual practices. How?<br>  Pray about the matter. Implore Jehovah as David did: “Search through me, O?God, and know my heart. Examine me, and know my disquieting thoughts, and see whether there is in me any painful way, and lead me in the way of time indefinite.” (Psalm 139:23,?24) Jehovah can fortify you with a peace that “excels all thought.” This can ‘guard your heart and your mental powers’ and give you “power beyond what is normal” to keep from acting on wrong desires.—Philippians 4:6,?7; 2?Corinthians 4:7.<br>  Fill your mind with upbuilding thoughts. (Philippians 4:8) Read the Bible daily. Never underestimate its power to shape your mind and heart for good. (Hebrews 4:12) A young man named Jason says: “The Bible—including such scriptures as 1?Corinthians 6:9, 10 and Ephesians 5:3—has had a powerful effect on me. I read these scriptures whenever wrong desires occur.”<br>  Shun pornography and gay propaganda. (Colossians 3:5) Avoid anything that will arouse immoral desires. This would include pornography, certain TV shows and movies, and perhaps even fashion or bodybuilding magazines that feature lightly clad models. Change negative thoughts to positive ones. “Whenever I have homosexual urges,” says one teenage boy, “I meditate on my favorite Bible text.”<br>  Of course, some claim that there’s no point in doing all this, that you should simply ‘embrace your sexuality’ and ‘accept who you are.’ But the Bible says that you can do better than that! It tells us, for example, that some early Christians who had formerly practiced homosexuality changed. (1?Corinthians 6:9-11) You too can win the battle—even if at this point it’s only being waged in your heart.<br>  What if same-sex desires persist? Do not give in to them! Jehovah condemns homosexual acts. Thus, the person who struggles with same-sex desires is presented with a reachable goal—he or she can choose not to act on those desires.<br>  To illustrate: A person might be “disposed to rage.” (Proverbs 29:22) In the past he may have freely give
Izn1ye9Raa	My in-laws have had lots of experience with jinn.  These are true stories told by my husband. <br>  1.My father in-law accidently killed a jinn when he was building their house when my husband and his bros/sisters were children.<br>  2.My in-laws live in Jizan, Saudi Arabia (Jinn prision where Prophet Solomon peace be upon him sent all the bad jinn). So apparently there's a bunch of ticked off jinn living in Jizan. My in-laws moved there because the heat is better for old people.<br>  3.My husband's uncle on his mother's side (the uncle died when my husband was small) used to live a mile or so away from my in-laws house, and there's a valley seperating his house from my in-laws house. My husband's dead uncle drove through the valley on a motorcycle all the time (there's tons of jinn in that valley), and my husband's uncle's motorcycle started slowing, so my husband's uncle looked at the back of the motorcycle and a rabbit was sitting on the back, keeping the motorcycle from driving fast. It stayed on there for a few minutes & then hopped off, and suddenly my husband's uncle's motorcycle went really fast.<br>  4.My husband, his 2 sisters, 3 brothers, and my in-laws used to live in a house with jinn. The jinn were living there first.  My mother-in-law was trying to sleep and the TV was on because she thought she heard her kids playing, and went downstairs and told them to be quiet so she could sleep.  And when she told my husband and his siblings this next morning, they all said it wasn't them. They had been sleeping.<br>  5. In same house as above, one time my mother-in-law thought she saw my husband sleeping on the couch and told him to go to sleep in his room, and a few minutes later my husband came in from playing outside. A jinn was impersonating my husband.  <br>  6. One of my big brother-in-laws when he was small, a jinn took possession of his body so the Imam had to be called to get the jinn out.<br>  7.Another of my brother-in-laws was possessed by a jinn when he was an adult and the jinn asked for a hot cup of coffee and then drank it down in one gulp.|`|1A1ozEaKaa	i've never had the ... pleasure of meeting a jinn myself, to be quite honest. but my family has. a lot. like my mom's great uncle, may he rest in peace, used to tame them or whatever. actually, in the outskirts of quetta, where my mom's other famli lived (cousins, aunts, etc.) they went to visit once, and appaerntly, a jinn possessed one of her cousins. she asid it was the single scariest thing she'd ever seen.|`|NlQhkgFCaa	Here <br>  <a href="http://www.islamawareness.net/Jinn/world.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamawareness.net/Jinn/world...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.islamawareness.net/Jinn/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamawareness.net/Jinn/</a>|`|AA11647647	There was a rapper named Jinn that was good in rap battles and got signed to the ruff riders label but got dropped because he could battle but not rap.|`|zBqt99avaa	on the weekend I was on the computer and Mustafa was cooking me supper.

wsLngQ8oaa	When I was little I could never wait to decorate. 3 weeks before Christmas, all our outside lights went up. 2 weeks before we'd decorate the house, and 1 week before the tree would go up. My mom passed away when I was about 5 so my uncle used to take me shopping for my dad. I remember Christmas eve we went to Grandma and Grandpa's and had Pasties (it's a pastry with steak and potatoes). After that we'd turn on the radio to listen for Santa sightings (before internet Santa trackers) Then we're go home and help dad put all his gifts under the tree (this way we didn't really get a chance to shake them and figure out what they were). We'd go to bed by 8:00 and we always left coffee and cookies, because my dad said when Santa was flying around outside all night he'd probably like something warm. On Christmas morning we weren't allowed to wake dad up until 5 am, but we were always awake by 2 or 3. So my brother and I went to the dollar store before Christmas and got snacks and had "Christmas breakfast" with our stuffed animals, and made gifts for them to give each other and us. That usually kept us busy until 5. Then we'd get up and open all the present from my dad or brothers, and they'd open ones from me, and of course santa's gifts. Then Grandma Grandpa and Uncle Bill would come over and we'd hit round 2 of gifts. around mid morning, Dad would hall out all the junk food we'd buy and leave them in trays around the house. We rarely ate a big meal on Christmas day. We also generally had a tummy ache by the end of the day too, because we didn't get junk like that all the time lol|`|nG5kgQmDaa	we would have to wait forever for my parents to wake up so we could open stockings.  then we also had to wait for ever so that my dad could get the Video Camera which sort of ruins it.  i would get all my presents and make a big pile of them before i opened them. after i opened them all i would bug my brother to open his. he got Legos for Christmas so he would open one, build it and ignore all his other presents. after i got all mine opened we would have a big breakfast.|`|zYGJh5Odaa	Every wakes up and runs down the stairs to look under the tree.<br>  No one is allowed to open gifts until after we all eat dinner or until every one comes over to my house. Then we can open presents and enjoy them.

On Christmas Eve we always go to Church, then go home and go to bed early.

It's a lot of fun, and we always remember the REAL reason we actually have a Christmas holiday.|`|AA11305474	We would go to church on Christmas Eve, open gifts afterward, light a fire, have a late dinner of goose, apple stuffing, bacon gravy haricort vert, beet salat and struedel.

d9d7dbffacb9c5256ef7afd69e6023b6aa	A myth, in my opinion.<br>  People are mostly water, and in order to burst into flame, you have to have a LOT of volatility. Body chemistry is fairly finely balanced, and if you had enough combustible content, then you probably would drop dead long before you caught fire.|`|2V4JHa1Saa	Spontaneous human combustion (SHC) is the burning of the human body without an apparent external source of ignition. As it is usually thought of as an unproven natural phenomenon, there is much speculation and controversy regarding SHC. In most cases, a small shrunken skull, part of a leg(s) (with the clothing still on), or sometimes both are found in the remains of the person thought to have combusted.<br>  <br>  Possible explanations:<br>  <br>  Many hypotheses have been put forth in attempts to explain how SHC might occur, based on current scientific understanding. These have generally failed to reach a satisfactory explanation of many of the recorded cases, when all the facts of the case are taken into account. As a result, some observers speculate that it is erroneous to speak of spontaneous combustion, and that there must have been a source of ignition. One such hypothesis is the "wick effect", in which the clothing of the victim soaks up melted human fat and acts like the wick of a candle. Another possibility is that the clothing is caused to burn by a discharge of static electricity. Some observers speculate that the likelihood that truly spontaneous human combustion actually takes place within the body is quite low.[1] However, it should be obvious that a meaningful calculation of likelihood or probability of any such event could not be made without a correct model of the mechanism. Another mechanism that has been proposed is that every living body also contains gases- oxygen in the lungs, and methane in the intestines. Electrical discharges might ignite these gases if they became mixed. Finally, this strange phenomenon might be explained by the presence of external non-chemical energy sources, e.g. directed-energy weapons, perhaps in the microwave region, perhaps being tested on human subjects in a highly illegal and unethical way.<br>  <br>  Whatever the nature of the phenomenon, a proper application of the scientific method requires that the physical implications of each hypothesis, in terms of predicted observables, must be compared against the carefully-analyzed details of each of the growing number of cases that have been recorded. Only in this way will the correct explanation eventually be discovered|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Yes but we have not head of any new cases for a very long time years.

I've met several people that have that problem and it is a bit uncomfortable around them, cause you don't know exactly where they are looking.|`|xCifmFfkaa	In these types of cases, don't try and focus on an eye, etc. It's best and most polite to lightly focus on the bridge of the person's nose, which is the center of the face eye-level.|`|BEor9ggMaa	Just say, " Hallo Herr Hahn Auge kann ich saugen Sie Hahn bitte ?? But be polite when u say it or u  may get fired|`|LBB9B8mFaa	Look at the one which seem to be looking straight at you.

I have no idea, but trying to talk to people with that problem really sucks.|`|woK6mApGaa	look at his nose. he wont know the difference|`|2qX4AkCdaa	This is always an uncomfortable situation!! The answer is to not look in either, but look directly in between, at the bridge of their nose, perhaps. <br>  <br>  When someone looks at you, even if they are choosing a certain eye to look at you normally can't tell unless they are darting back and forth between eyes. This is because your eyes are generally in the center of your face. When they look at you it generally looks as if they are looking at you dead center. So if you look between their eyes and make the bridge of their nose your focal point, it will look normal to them and you'll feel more comfortable not looking into their crazy eyes.|`|6OFHemITaa	Straight at the bridge of his nose works for me.  Also, I have heard that looking at the eyes back and forth, but I'd go for the bridge!|`|6b3TGvJ5aa	Look him directly in the eyes - no matter which direction his eyes move, just keep straight focused on his face and eyes.|`|M8X0dIOZaa	Look at his nose or mouth instead. Or look back and forth between both of them like you do with anyone. Likely he won't notice.

His job is to basically make sure the guy is the real deal....he is who he claims he is....all that sorta stuff.  Girls can be naive when it comes the nature of men.   I personally have witnessed many....girl is in love....guy is doing whatever it takes to sleep with her and then move on.   <br>  <br>  If he is saying no for reasons that do not pertain to islam....then no.  You are suppose to find someone who can do some investigative work and make a decision with the girl's best interest in mind in terms of islam.|`|ou20w5sCaa	Bismillahi Rahmani Rahim<br>  <br>  Salaam Alaikum wa Rahmatullah<br>  <br>  Yes, a woman must have the approval of her guardian to marry.  That would be her father, first and foremost.  If he does not allow her to marry a particular person and she does so anyway, then the marriage is not valid.  <br>  <br>  If the father is forbidding the girl from marrying with no good reason, for instance, if he wants his daughter to take care of him and forbids her from marrying at all, then he can have his guardianship overruled.  Her brother can approve, or if there is no one in her family to act as wali, then the Islamic court can act as her wali after she has gone to them seeking justice.  <br>  <br>  If a woman's family is not Muslim, then her male relatives cannot be her wali, so the Muslim court would act as her wali.  If she is in a non-Muslim country, the Imaam of her local mosque or another upright trusted male member of the community - one who is NOT related to the man she proposes to marry - can act as her wali.  And Allah knows best.<br>  <br>  fi Aman Allah,<br>  <br>  Nancy Umm Abdel Hamid<br>  <br>  P.S.  Please, my sister in Islam, I would ask you to change your avatar.

However her non-Muslim family is not mahram to her and a non-Muslim man does not count as her Wali, even if it is her father.|`|UibsALccaa	UmmAbdelHamid is right. You need a mehram.

3voyKL30aa	Sweetheart, I have always felt the same way.  It is very awkward for me and although it is a beautiful ceremony for some, it is  very uncomfortable for me.  Good thing is that God(all encompassing term) is within each of us and we do not have to kneel in front of a cross.  The purpose of religion is to find our potential as humans, and I have found that personally meditating works a lot better, there are a lot of meditation practices you can look up on the internet.  The book, "Eat, Pray, Love" by Elizabeth Gilbert has been very beneficial to me. Hopefully it will make it a lot clearer to you.  Good luck and remember the closer you get to yourself and understanding yourself the closer you get to "god'.|`|XwuZYLg1aa	I need more information to help you.  Why do you not feel comfortable?  Did someone at church mistreat you?  Do you have feelings of guilt?  Do you think everyone there is perfect and you don't fit in?  Do you think that those there are hypocrites that are just pretending to be Christians?  I might could help if I knew your thoughts and reasons for being uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Let me suggest you spend time with God alone and in studious reflection on His word and your life.  Find a church that is dedicated to being Biblical and not merely entertaining.  Find a group that wants to help each other get to heaven.  That is what assembling with the church is about (Heb 10:24-25).|`|gSxYuDEEaa	Church is for fellowship with other believers.  you do not need church you need Jesus.  Jesus restores your fellowship with God.  with that restored relationship and the Holy Spirit indwelling in you, your desire to fellowship with other believers will increase.  church then becomes a choice, a joyful choice not a "have to" thing.|`|Q7lvSU03aa	There are hundreds of different types of churches.  Some are traditional, some are more modern.  If you are not comfortable at a certain church, try to understand why.  I think there is a good uncomfortable and a bad uncomfortable.  Good is when you are feeling convicted and bad is when you don't agree or like the way they run their service.<br>  <br>  Look on the internet for other churches in your area.  Go and see if they might better fit your needs.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fjMJJnCUaa	Get closer to an invisible lie? <br>  <br>  Wow, nice. Go ahead, go to church and feel that false fulfillment and have your decisions made by a book written by monks couple a thousand years ago<br>  <br>  <br>  Satan bless<br>  <br>  Devil 21:5|`|KntBP2Zmaa	meditate which is just sitting still, don't think, just listen...|`|jOPUBmlJaa	Sigh...<br>  Churches are silly I think.|`|AA11690436	Maybe try a different type of Church.  Ever consider Universal Unitarianism?  Not only do they wonderful congregations, you get to follow your own path to God, while also learning about how others are going about it.|`|TzY9vkinaa	keep going and you'll feel more comfortable over time.|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	Finding the right Church Home for you is not an easy task.... I prefer the smaller congregations... visit as many as you can...  and not just once... unless there is something really off about one.... attend more than just the main service... go to the "Sunday School" as well... and try to attend other functions of the congregations life... get to know the people personaly and allow them to get to know you... It does take time... that is why I like the smaller congregations... it is easier to get involved... if you are not made to feel welcome by any congregation claiming to be of The Christian Faith... let me know... I want to have a talk with them.<br>  <br>  I invite you to visit my site at: <a href="http://mikevanauken.pages.qpg.com/mikesfaith/" rel="nofollow">http://mikevanauken.pages.qpg.com/mikesf...</a><br>  <br>  If you have any questions feel free to contact me from the site.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Jesus is God.  Believe in Jesus and you are close to Him  :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|5pgVIlLFaa	Maybe try another church. I tried several before I found one that made me feel right at home. Certain religions make you feel not worthy while others make you feel loved|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	If you think God is everywhere then there is no way to get closer to him.
WKsGpvEIaa	Everyone has the same "opportunities", but that doesn't mean all can achieve their goals with the same effort.  Anyone can go to Harvard, but the well off student has a better chance of making it than a poor person.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I believe we do. It is all your attitude and how hard you are willing to work for your dreams. <br>  <br>  Yes, it is true that a person who is from a richer family has a better chance of succeeding than a person born into a poor family. Richer people have better education, that is true. <br>  <br>  Now, we all have choices. There is something I like to call "poor culture." There is a lot of violence and sex and a lot of poor people make bad choices. A lot of the guys get in trouble and become violent. The girls get pregnant young and drop out of school. Only half the poor population has a high school degree. How sad is that? Their schools are not the greatest, but they could at least graduate. <br>  <br>  There are grants and scholarships AVAILABLE to low income students who wish to go to college. All they need is the GPA, which requires a lot of studying and dedication. <br>  <br>  As far as I am concered, a poor person can do it. He/she also needs support from his/her family which unfortunately many don't.|`|d3A83djHaa	I agree with you.  A person that goes to an inner city school has a much lower chance of even going to college, let alone an ivy league school.  A wealthy person is usually well enough connected to get into whatever school he/she wants.|`|tuko08W3aa	it depends on, if they have a good sense of discipline and people who will be there for them, if you care for your kids and are concern about what they are doing then they will succeed but if you are self absorbed and don't care about your child and leave them to their own choices then they will not succeed and waste away its a fact that a child attendant will not succeed like a child that has concern parents or family members to look over them

e1a7697c7943bcffd2fa613b82800630aa	At death the spirit leaves the body and the person goes either to paradise, a place of rest, or spirit prison.  Resurrection takes place when the spirit is reunited with the glorified physical body.  We may look to Jesus as an example of how this works.<br>  <br>  1 Peter 3:18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: <br>    19 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; <br>  <br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 15:40 There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. <br>    41 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. <br>    42 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: <br>    43 It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: <br>    44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.|`|VncSMLMpaa	We are mortal - we die. Jesus was mortal - he died, but because the LORD God is his Father the grave could not hold him. Jesus was sinless although "he was tempted in all points like as we are".<br>  <br>  When Jesus' friend Lazarus died his sisters were very sad and told Jesus that if he had been there their brother would not have died. Jesus wept. He wept because of the suffering of the family.<br>  <br>  When Jesus called Lazarus from his grave he had been dead there for four days. His sisters thought he would stink. But Lazarus came out still bound up with the grave clothes. Jesus said that they should release him. Did Lazarus say that he had been in some better place? Was he sorry to be back? Nothing of the sort. The Bible says :<br>  <br>  Psalm 115<br>  17 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.  <br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 9<br>  5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.  <br>  <br>  Psam 6<br>  5 For in death [there is] no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?  <br>  <br>  Acts 2<br>  29 Men [and] brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.  <br>  <br>  Acts 2<br>  34 For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  <br>  <br>  John 3<br>  13 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, [even] the Son of man which is in heaven.|`|p6wwiQG3aa	How About God.....they both have that in common<br>  <br>  other than that.....they are vewry different|`|gSxYuDEEaa	the body dies, the soul lives on.  the resurrected body is the immortal soul, clothed in a body that is fit for our heavenly dwelling.  just as a fish's body is designed to live in water and our bodies to live on land, so too our new bodies will house our soul in a body fit for heaven.|`|oBmLIDHtaa	Similarities are that they are both myths based on bronze age superstition.<br>  <br>  There really aren't that many differences.|`|A9oWuOFBaa	Both are complete fiction.|`|p15pj8jnaa	Maybe I can shed some light on the topic.

He is much stronger and faster than you are. You know that he is merciless because you have seen him kill some of your friends. No matter how hard you try to outrun him, he keeps getting closer. There seems to be no hope. Suddenly, though, a rescuer appears at your side. He is far more powerful than your enemy, and he promises to help you. How relieved that makes you feel!<br>  2 In a sense, you are being pursued by such an enemy. All of us are. As we learned in the preceding chapter, the Bible calls death an enemy. None of us can outrun it or fight it off. Most of us have seen this enemy claim the lives of people dear to us. But Jehovah is far more powerful than death. He is the loving Rescuer who has already shown that he can defeat this enemy. And he promises to destroy this enemy, death, once and for all. The Bible teaches: “As the last enemy, death is to be brought to nothing.” (1?Corinthians 15:26) That is good news!<br>  3 Let us take a brief look at how the enemy death affects us when it strikes. Doing this will help us to appreciate something that will make us happy. You see, Jehovah promises that the dead will live again. (Isaiah 26:19) They will be brought back to life. That is the hope of the resurrection.<br>  WHEN A LOVED ONE DIES<br>  4 Have you lost a loved one in death? The pain, the grief, and the feelings of helplessness can seem unbearable. At such times, we need to go to God’s Word for comfort. (2?Corinthians 1:3,?4) The Bible helps us to understand how Jehovah and Jesus feel about death. Jesus, who perfectly reflected his Father, knew the pain of losing someone in death. (John 14:9) When he was in Jerusalem, Jesus used to visit Lazarus and his sisters, Mary and Martha, who lived in the nearby town of Bethany. They became close friends. The Bible says: “Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.” (John 11:5) As we learned in the preceding chapter, though, Lazarus died.<br>  5 How did Jesus feel about losing his friend? The account tells us that Jesus joined Lazarus’ relatives and friends as they grieved over this loss. Seeing them, Jesus was deeply moved. He “groaned in the spirit and became troubled.” Then, the account says, “Jesus gave way to tears.” (John 11:33,?35) Did Jesus’ grief mean that he had no hope? Not at all. In fact, Jesus knew that something wonderful was about to happen. (John 11:3,?4) Still, he felt the pain and sorrow that death brings.<br>  6 In a way, Jesus’ grief is encouraging to us. It teaches us that Jesus and his Father, Jehovah, hate death. But Jehovah God is able to fight and overcome that enemy! Let us see what God enabled Jesus to do.<br>  “LAZARUS, COME ON OUT!”<br>  7 Lazarus had been buried in a cave, and Jesus asked that the stone sealing its entrance be taken away. Martha objected because after four days, Lazarus’ body must have begun to decay. (John 11:39) From a human standpoint, what hope was there?<br>  8 The stone was rolled away, and Jesus cried out with a loud voice: “Lazarus, come on out!” What happened? “The man that had been dead came out.” (John 11:43,?44) Can you imagine the joy of the people there? Whether Lazarus was their brother, relative, friend, or neighbor, they knew that he had died. Yet, here he was—the same dear man—standing among them again. That must have seemed too good to be true. Many no doubt embraced Lazarus joyfully. What a victory over death!<br>  9 Jesus did not claim to perform this amazing miracle on his own. In his prayer just before calling out to Lazarus, he made it clear that Jehovah was the Source of the resurrection. (John 11:41,?42) This was not the only time that Jehovah used his power in this way. The resurrection of Lazarus is just one of nine miracles of this kind recorded in God’s Word. To read and study these accounts is a delight. They teach us that God is not partial, for the resurrected ones include young and old, male and female, Israelite and non-Israelite. And what joy is described in these passages! For example, when Jesus raised a young girl from the dead, her parents “were beside themselves with great ecstasy.” (Mark 5:42) Yes, Jehovah had given them a cause for joy that they would never forget.<br>  10 Of course, those resurrected by Jesus eventually died again. Does this mean that it was pointless to resurrect them? Not at all. These Bible accounts confirm important truths and give us hope.<br>  LEARNING FROM THE RESURRECTION ACCOUNTS<br>  11 The Bible teaches that the dead “are conscious of nothing at all.” They are not alive and have no conscious existence anywhere. The account of Lazarus confirms this. Upon returning to life, did Lazarus thrill people with descriptions of heaven? Or did he terrify them with horrible

NzQjMBCfaa	I believe so, God says alot of things about marriage in the Bible. From all the way from beginnings of time with Adam and Eve, he created and man and a woman, not 2 men. It says husbands ought to love their wives, not husbands ought to love their husband. But of course all we can do for those is pray for them. It happening in our world, but its not pleasing to the Lord. Here are some scriptures about same sex marriage and what marriage is really suppose to be.<br>  <br>  Romans 1:27   <br>  In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. <br>  <br>  1Corr 6:9Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders<br>  <br>  Hebrews 13:4   <br>  Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral. <br>  <br>  <marriage existed even in the Bible Days><br>  For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; <br>  <br>  <br>  Ephesians 5:28   <br>  In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.|`|pqveENjUaa	Nope. Several religions did come up with their own marriage ceremonies though. That is why the whole gay marriage debate even exists right now. A lot of Christians believe that their religion founded the concept of marriage, and thus they believe that they should have complete control over it. <br>  <br>  While i agree that the individual performing the ceremony should be given the right to refuse to marry someone by his own set of beliefs, i also believe that legally the government should have no power to prevent gays from marrying. If someone wants to marry two gay people, he should be allowed to.|`|JAZqgHpGaa	Right on.<br>  <br>  I could go for that.<br>  <br>  Then again, I think that married couples put less of a strain on society and therefore should get some sort of break with regard to taxes.<br>  <br>  Marriage has its roots in natural history.  If you allow "marriage" to be synonymous with pair bonding.<br>  The quasi religious idea of "marriage" is probably an aberration or illness.|`|81SiImlSaa	Actually the word marriage is Latin (specifically Roman) and was a pagan ceremony used to bond families much like the modern version today.  Another rather interesting fact is that marriage between same sex was common and was practised up until the Council of Nicaea, which of course changed everything and suddenly gay people were evil.  <br>  <br>  God did not create marriage.  Man did.  PERIOD!|`|Ve18FAnGaa	kind of.  people need to recignize that the government can define a term (in legal speak) as anything they like.  that is usually the courts job because legislators will create the law and then judges will define it based on their action in a case regarding it.  a legal definition of marriage would not stop churches from defining it differently.   it would also not stop them from only issuing marriages to people they chose (as they do now).  <br>  if churches are soooo concerned about the term 'marriage' then i agree, we should just remove it all together from our law.  they can then continue to marry people and if those people want tax breaks then they can file for a civil union.  ..like any other consenting adults no mater what gender.|`|Aa6XHuENaa	No.  Marriages existed long before the abrahamic religions decided that they own the concept.  <br>  <br>  Realistically, the "sanctity of marriage" as fundies preach about it (as it existed in biblical times at least) was basically a contract by which a man would sell his daughter to another man.<br>  <br>  The definition has clearly changed since then.  Why not again?|`|b1yr0KDEaa	Nope. Religion co-opted marriage, but it didn't invent it. People have gotten non-religious, "civil" marriages for centuries! Read "The Woman's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets" by Barbara Walker to get the full story.|`|tO9QjrEkaa	I think it's unfair that marriage is only outlawed for a select few. I DEMAND EQUAL RIGHTS! Outlaw marriage for me too!|`|78fc8bc2259086fa893dc874f9f06ecdaa	Marriage exists in so many different religions I think either it's proof that all religions stem from the same root or that marriage is something independent of religion.|`|T5BshhZWaa	jajajajajajajajajaja<br>  DUMB REASONING|`|yOK32PM9aa	No, from economic and domestic alliances which predate any religious interest in them.|`|AA11690436	Well, unless you believe in a literal interpretation of Genesis, marriages have been around a lot longer than almost any currently practiced religions.  And here in the U.S. in addition to any service you have done in a church, you need a civil marriage license.  And you can married by a judge or some other kind of non churchy marriage officiant, and have it still be a legal marriage.  Allowing same sex marriages DOES NOT require any church to perform such marriages if it has an objection.  It does afford the same rights to same sex couples, however, who choose to married by a Judge or some in some religious denomination that doesn't object to same sex marriages.  In fact, as of this date, there are types of congregations that WILL perform "commitment" ceremonies, but it is the STATE that will not recognize that marriage.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I didn't mean to imply that marriage was older than religion itself, just older than most currently practiced religions.  If you read accounts from ancient Summeria or ancient Egypt, both of whose histories extend back to at least six thousand years, you'll find accounts of their marriage practices.  Also, if you look at the archeology of neolithic sites, the burials and households indicate family structure was more or less what we're familiar with (and we can, with reasonable assurance, assume neolithic peoples practiced some form of animistic or shamanistic religions).<br>  <br>  The wiki article goes into a little detail about the history of the institution.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage#History" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage#Hi...</a>|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Religion did not invent marriage. It has existed in one or more forms in every culture on earth for as long as there have been people. In many cultures, marriage had nothing to do with religion at all. It was simply a personal matter. <br>  <br>  In the Amazon, there is a tribe where marriage is polyandrous (one woman with more than one husband). That's the only form they practice. It's not a religious belief, just their culture.<br>  <br>  Marriage in the Bible also took more than one form. The most common was polygamy.|`|i6QfwNTJaa	marriages were in existence way before any religion, so what do u think about that now?<br>  and yeah it would be wonderful, not to have any responsibility to ur kin etc... NOT. it has been around for a reason and i for one think it is a good thing.<br>  and the gays should be allowed to marry, sure, probably not in a church but should be ok in a courthouse. <br>  but u know how that song and dance goes. needs to be extended till someone gives up the cause. that works perfectly for churches.|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	no, marriage was more of a legal contract between 2 men (the husband and the father of the bride).<br>  <br>  but i agree, we should have civil commitments only, and marriage should be only a religious thing, not a government thing. that way each group can define marriage as narrowly as they like, without taking away the rights of other americans that have different religious beliefs.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	from God....no it doesnt....for them its about $$ and collecting taxes|`|FIXKYCIGaa	Marriage is predominantly a legal institution. Members of the clergy are authorized by the state to perform marriages, but so is a judge and in some cases even a notary public can perform the ceremony.  The clergy perform the ceremonies based on their beliefs but the proof that it is a legal institution is A, a marriage doesn't have to be performed by a member of the clergy, B, permission to get married (a marriage license) is issued by the state and C, the clergy can't dissolve a marriage.  Obviously there are shades of gray such as when the couple gets legally divorced but the church views them as still married, however that Church view has no bearing on their legal status.<br>  Bottom line is the church is extraneous to the marriage process and really shouldn't have any say as to who, outside of members of that specific religion, should be able to get married.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	Europe already puts this into practice.<br>  <br>  In most European nations, you are specifically prohibited from having religious elements during the civil-office ceremony, and the church is specifically not empowered or even allowed to touch the legal contract.<br>  <br>  The state handles the union, the church handles the marriage.<br>  <br>  Would that the USA figured it out already.|`|8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	The "separation between Church and State" is a puffed up slogan that no serious politicion or lawyer believes, not even Thomas Jefferson.<br>  <a href="http://www.catholicleague.org/research/dreisbach.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholicleague.org/research/d...</a><br>  <br>  How well will it go over with people when they are told they cannot get married?

Originally, it was simply a means to consolidate wealth or power. Neither love nor any sort of spirituality played a role. But that's just one of many many things that have changed regarding marriage over time.|`|ce26AOVzaa	marriage was given to the lust of the flesh to bless it. God hates the love of a man and woman for really if you see with your eyes it is like the beast and men and a woman. There is no a man and a woman. You bounce around on each other on the flesh.  So God put marriage their so he can bless it, and you do not get thrown into hell. Heaven has no home for marriage and his will is suppose to be done ON EARTH, as it IS IN HEAVEN. the only reason he excepted it is because no one sees and it is honorable to be married and pretened you love one another.<br>  <br>  marriage is nothing but a beast between man and woman.|`|2ogimlBxaa	No, actually.

In today's society you don't know if the people are carrying a gun or if they have a knife and if they do if they will use it.<br>  It is easier, and of better manners to just move on and look for a better spot.  It could save you a lot of time and agony and also let it go and know your are a more mature and better person.  Do not let it ruin your day or keep it pent up.  Release it right away knowing you did the best thing.  Good luck.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|WuhIoS1laa	Ah, parking lot etiquette. I hate it. Because nobody follows any.<br>  <br>  If it would have been silly to do parking lot gymnastics with your cars to get into the spots you originally intended, it kinda makes sense that he took the first available spot. Then you would take the one he originally intended to take when it's freed up. <br>  <br>  If I suspect someone five cars away of trying to snipe a spot, I will position my car so they can't. If I can't do that, then there's nothing to be done. Unfair, but move on.|`|OBwqjS8maa	Ugh why are people such jerks when they get behind the wheel? Knowing me, I'd be silently cussing him out and stewing over it all day but I wouldn't say anything. I'm not a huge fan of confrontation. But hey, if you feel like you could ***** him out, why not? He deserves it!|`|AA12146958	Parking is first come first served. He beat you to the spot. You just go find another spot to park.|`|mQZDizMVaa	This is exactly why I'm one of those drivers who avoid waiting for a parking spot: usually the spots furthest away from buildings, or malls are empty, and that's where I park. I don't mind walking.<br>  <br>  My motto is "The Less I Have To Deal With Fanatics Who Think They Own A Parking Spot, The Better."|`|rThIVk2maa	Stay away from violent and unpredictable drivers. The proper response to this is the same as you would respond to any other potentially dangerous person: get away quickly, especially if you're on the road or in your car.<br>  <br>  By treating him this way, he will feel embarrassed, which is the point. It also keeps you safer, because you don't know quite if this person is insane or not and it's better to just stay away from him.
7gH7sgi6aa	According to the Big Book of Etiquette, indeed you do.  This is your way of acknowledging the fact that you received the card and that you appreciated the fact that they cared about you and your family during your time of grief.  Keep it simple and very polite, but personal if they are good friends.  If you hardly know them then keep it more simple and polite.  Good luck.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	Only if the card contained a gift of cash or a check.

ZtHKL257aa	I would like to know why you're asking, not because I'm making fun of you, but because I really am intrigued.<br>  <br>  But now for my answer, and pay attention, this is not what I believe every "were-creature" goes through, but at least it is what my area's legends have told us!<br>  <br>  The curse it self is not necessarily brought on you by bite, actually, I don't believe it happens that way at all. Sages say it has something to do with heritage, that your family is somewhat "special", and that most people of your bloodline actually possess the curse, but only a few have the right spirit too, the mind of the "changeling" as we call it. Some say you are born with a mark, some physical deformity that actually helps the "change" when the time is right. It has actually been proved that certain deformities that are not supposed to have any hereditary link are more common in certain families than others.<br>  <br>  They say that you don't start feeling the curse for real until you reach puberty, but always a sensitive child before that. Intellectual, strong willed and a habit of being able to do things that others would not have believed possible before.<br>  <br>  When the change starts, it is supposed to start slowly, your hearing suddenly becomes much better, your eyesight becomes "complicated", not being able to read a book because the fine fibers of the pages keep irritating you for example, and you can tell what the people living three miles away are having for dinner. <br>  <br>  After that it gets interesting, thoughts in your head that aren't yours, memories of the past that don't make any sense, cravings, voices, the sense of knowing without a reason... you become so distant from the living world that there is no wonder that the great sages once talked about when the "changelings" became alone in the crowd, although today I would call it something close to a clinical depression.<br>  <br>  I bet you've sometimes felt super hyper on a good evening, getting the craving to go out and dance in the rain or just play airplanes on the street ( yes, you are the airplanes ). Imagine feeling like this regularly, and then suddenly discover a pattern; when the moon is full, half full, new moon, half empty...<br>  I found this hard to believe at first, but then I realized, the moon controls our inner timing, why couldn't it control the mood swings of mythical creatures.<br>  <br>  Now, I don't know a lot more about the adolescence of young were people, but stories have told about people found by lakes, rivers, ponds, waterfalls and more recently in the showers, badly scratched and even so badly that they'd bled out... sightings claiming they looked like they'd been trying to scratch out of their own skin...<br>  But, that was before the time of Aloe-vera...<br>  <br>  The full grown were man is more complicated, there are a lot of different stories of them, but all stating them being unable to control their lust to become what they were meant to become, but some seem to be more capable of control after the actual change, even to the point of being "domesticated". The change itself, it is complicated, and whether or not they can control it seems to be, again, dependent on the person itself...<br>  <br>  Menu, I believe, consists of whatever the creature wants, although blood seems to be the obvious choice... don't know why, but all cultures seem to have this in common... <br>  <br>  I've got more if you want, just e-mail me and I'll answer your questions ( allij@torg.is )|`|HEDSOHq1aa	i don't know much about werewolves<br>  but, the guy above me is not correct on the sight part. we wolves' eyes lack the foveal depression on the retina<br>  <br>  if any human had the ability to change into a wolf, i wouldn't call that a curse|`|BhEsZMG8aa	Since they don't exist, no.|`|LVv2tmWRaa	Depends on the kind of werewolf, or rather the superstition. Some countries believe that werewolves change based on their temper, not only the moon. And there's another one about them changing when a certain plant (wolfsbane) is in bloom, which would make the change seasonal.<br>  <br>  As for eating habits, I'm pretty sure most people believe that werewolves eat raw meat, if not humans.|`|fKZoljSCaa	I think that every turn (transformation work) is painful, lycan's are animals, so when they change the bone structure must change as well. But they can't control it, they can fight their hunger and attacking humans by gorging themselves with blood in packages. However if they (vampires and lycan's) don't have there blood while in turning mode they will die.|`|5Zs7IDweaa	Werewolfs / Lycans do exist yes.<br>  For you information ( if you do not know) the "curse" is like a second soul or energy flow that takes over the body under full moon.<br>  i do know know that much, but from what my friend (who is a vampire) they can control them self, depending on their mental strenght, strnght of they "curse" and theyr'e control over their'e energy/shakra flow.<br>  <br>  I whis i could answer you better but im still a novice vamp.|`|KqNy8dHXaa	well from folklore, not those fake movies  they can control it, but it would be really hard to do so. you had to be really focused. at times, have you noticed the moon might still be in the sky? they eat what wolves would eat, meat, deer, dead carcasses, and a last resort, humans. they have wolf like personality's, not dog like.  although younger children might act dog like if they had the curse.

2V4JHa1Saa	We too live in a home with spirits.Alot of them.The thing to do is not be afraid of them.They want to communicate.I feel the Ouija Board is very dangerous.You think you have problems now; Mess with that board and things will get alot worse.With the board you can bring the bad spirits in and they're harder to get rid of than the passive ones.Get some holy water and go in every part of the house.Sprinkle even in your closets.Say prayers asking them to go into the light and be at peace.Remind them that they are deceased.Plus sprinkle salt around the whole outside of your place.Good luck! And remember they can't hurt you.You'll do great. and also i have a cousin who sees spirits on a daily basis and i was being followed by an evil spirit i didn't know was there until she moved in and i spent more and more time with her and it got angry because i wasn't all to him anymore and i had to rid of him ... hopefully what happened to me is not the case for you|`|Y6odIQgJaa	Buy some sage from your local herb shop and burn it in the house.  Carry it with you as it burns, to each room and closet.<br>  <br>  Then daily, burn incense while telling (not asking) the spirit to move toward the light.  Do this until you feel it has done so.<br>  <br>  Please don't worry about it.  I think you have a poltergeist from your description, nothing evil.  I had one when my daughter was little and I got it to move on in the way I stated above.<br>  <br>  Sounds like your fiance is just razzing ya about those "fiery eyes."|`|dFBccLExaa	Best way to protect yourself and your home is with a cleansing/blessing and wards/shields/barriers.

Because your problems and the solutions you find are going to always be as unique as you yourself are.<br>  <br>  Which is not to say that others cannot offer advice about what will and what will not work, but ultimately only your own effort is really going to count in your life.  <br>  <br>  To this end, we have some guidelines about what perspectives will allow us to see the problems and solutions most clearly, but we don't have a long list of "thou shalts" and "thou shalt nots".

I don't think you should be open with it to everyone unless you are emotionally and physically ready. Perhaps you could talk to your parents about it, would they be understanding? There is nothing wrong with being bi, its perfectly normal and don't let ANYONE tell you otherwise or get you down about it. Be proud of yourself! I'm sure it would help if you went onto bi chat-rooms just to talk to others and hear their experiences, you'll be able to relate to them and it will be good to talk to someone that has been through what you are going through at the moment. Going onto aol.com or yahoo.com and going to chat and communication, you'll find safe chatrooms to talk to others, if this is no good just go to google.com and enter safe bi chatrooms and remember to stay safe and go into the right age group on chatrooms.

a2f1a6b961af33c6049c53468b288e28aa	I ran across this last month:<br>  <br>  Journal of Addictions Nursing, Volume 14, Issue 1 Spring 2003 , pages 43 - 47  Abstract <br>  "Thirteenth-stepping" is a euphemistic term used among members of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) to refer to people (particularly men) who target new, more vulnerable members (typically women) for dates or sex. Previous research suggests that women frequently experience sexual harassment in AA meetings and even in chemical dependency treatment settings. The objective of this survey study is to describe the frequency of various 13th-stepping experiences in a sample of women involved in AA.<br>  <br>  Fifty-five women, aged 17-72 years, completed an anonymous survey to describe their experiences with 13th-stepping by men in AA. Results showed that at least 50% of the participants had at least occasionally experienced seven of the thirteen 13th-stepping behaviors listed in the survey. Also, compared to women who had never attended a female-only AA group, women who had attended such groups reported more 13th-stepping experiences from their attendance at coed groups. Two of the study participants volunteered that men they met in AA had raped them.<br>  <br>  It is important that chemical dependency treatment providers be aware of 13th-stepping in AA, particularly when treating women. Especially vulnerable women, such as those with histories of sexual abuse, should be referred to female-only groups when possible. When women's groups are unavailable, women should be adequately prepared to protect themselves from 13th-stepping. <a href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all?content=10.1080/10884600305373" rel="nofollow">http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content...</a>|`|2948461bc351babded4abfbd847dceecaa	I was and from that experience vowed never to interfere with a newcomer's journey in recovery.

AA11173607	the only reason why God gave them a rule like "dont eat that fruit" is to give them free will. God wants us to chose between worshipping Him and not being a Christian. if He had created them with a dislike for all fruits, they wouldnt of had the free will choice to obey or disobey -- they would have just been living|`|6hfRXDqcaa	then you wouldnt be here asking that question. He had already created angels who do not have freewill. freewill can make us better than angels or as worse as devil just based on your choices during your life. ...besides, He had  forgiven adam and eve before sending them to earth (this according to islam belief) So sending to earth was not a punishment.|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	what fun would there be in that?|`|IqqaA2wIaa	that isnt true...<br>  <br>  ok I misread that its so negative.....HE ALWAYS GIVES US A CHOICE....HE DOESNT WANT ROBOTS....HE WANTS WILLINGNESS|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	Because it is not actually the fruit that made them sin but curiosity to find why some thing is forbidden.

It was one of two trees in the garden, the other being the "tree of life".<br>  <br>  These trees are thought to represent two originally separate traditions which the biblical author has brought together to express his view of the origin of the human condition. The first tree belongs to a distinctly Israelite tradition. The "knowledge of good and evil" probably means the capacity for rational and ethical judgement. This attribute belongs supremely to God, who forbids humans to acquire it. After the first human pair has defied his command, God condemns them and their descendants to a life of toil and pain. <br>  <br>  He drives them from the garden in order to deny them the fruit of the tree of life, which would bestow the other divine attribute, eternal life (Genesis 3:22-24). Thus humans are like God in one respect but, unlike him, they die. In this distinction lies the vast potential but also the limitation of human existence.<br>  <br>  A sacred tree that confers eternal life occurs in many mythologies and is common in Near Eastern iconography. Numerous myths of the region explain that humanity is mortal because one person failed to eat a magical food that would have made them live forever (one example is found in the Mesopotamian epic of Gilgamesh). But the story in Genesis is alone in stressing that humans continue to suffer death as a direct consequence of their disobedience to God's command.<br>  <br>  Sorry about this.

VkzmH1GKaa	A few years ago I was working in the life insurance business. The company I worked for went to people's homes to collect monthly premiums and show new products. In doing business that way you really get to know people and find out very person things. I have went in homes in the middle of family crisis, deaths, births and so on. <br>  <br>  While introducing a new agent to clients on the route he was to work once we made a stop out in the country. We had laptops that we used to do business. We entered a home through an old screen door where an older copule lived. The wife called us into the living room where her husband was sleeping in a recliner, which he usually did. After the introductions, the new agent took a seat on the couch and opened the laptop. He then proceeded to speak with the client making small talk and reviewing her account. The wife was standing in the kitchen door listening while watching her pots on the stove. On the couch next to the agent the couch cusion was a small indentation that looked like a bed had been made there. The agent reached over and looked inside. I heard him say to the wife oh you have baby daschound puppies. He started petting the bed area. The wife laughed and then said those aren't puppies that's a gopher rat that got in here and had babies. <br>  <br>  The laptop flew in the air as the agent bloted for the door. He went straight though the screen door and was down the road out of sight.

ECB8u72Taa	The title of duke or duchess isn't inheritable in the way that you're suggesting.  In order to have the title you should have inherited the duchy or dukedom.<br>  <br>  Sons and daughters of a duke are known by the honorary title of "Lord Firstname" or "Lady Firstname." The eldest son will frequently hold some lesser title given by tradition in the family to the heir. The degree of that title would depend upon the titles available to the family -- it would not necessarily be the degree immediately beneath the rank of Duke.<br>  <br>  However, if you're really interested in obtaining such a title, you can buy a title.  Duchies such as Uphall, Redmile, Stanton, Stoke, Uphall, and Cudworth are known to be for sale by the square inch in order to sell titles.  It's silly really.|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	No, you are american it would be illegal for you to hold a royal title.|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	no, the direct descendnt from king stephen is probably an average joe bloggs, many things appen, familys are ovrthrown, people lose their wealt, the duchy becomes obsolte<br>  <br>  if that were ten I would be King of The United Kingdom|`|W3rXCrr9aa	The usual thing is that to be a Duchess you'd have to be the wife or widow of  a Duke. Or if your father were the Duke and the title were inheritable to heirs general rather than just males, than if the oldest child is a girl she would be a Duchess in her own right.  But if your father were a Duke, you'd know it. <br>  <br>   I don't know the rules for each place that has a nobility so I won't  quite say 'impossible" but it is extremely unlikely.  If all direct descendants of Dukes were themselves Dukes and Duchesses, it would be quite a common thing to be one, whereas it's actually quite rare. . I'm also a direct descendant of a duc but I'm certainly not a duchesse. :)  <br>  <br>   But even if it doesn't mean you have some noble title, researching your ancestors can be a fun framework to learn some history, and for the nobility  there are often records going back a LONG way.  Like in my family  i think  to about 800 AD!   What you need to do is research that particular title, that line, and learn something of the rules  in that country or province.  Do you know the name and title (the Duke of _______) of your ducal ancestor and where he was from?  That's what you need to start with. <br>   I'll give you some links for researching nobles.|`|NYU37jfGaa	No.  Normally, the eldest son of a Duke inherits the title of Duke, and his wife is a Duchess. If there is no son it goes to the nearest male relative.  I think there are a few hereditary titles than can pass through the female line, but I am not sure which.   A Duke's children do not all become Dukes and Duchesses, if they did then there would be millions of them by now, and it would all be getting a bit silly.|`|jfDggfMCaa	I am the direct descendant of a King and that doesn't make me one.<br>  The own son of that king,my gggggreatgranddad,was relieved by own will of taking after the charge and duty to claim the crown and didn't wrangle in feud with his siblings for it,killing each other and bringing war to the country.He and our branch of the family was always admired for it,and earned the respect of the throne holders,to whom we lend our best efforts not only out of national loyalty but because we all are related more or less in a kingdom with the passing of time,and before time through ascendant(s).<br>  Nobilitas per factam,non cartam.|`|08d3778f46ccb1088efa36be8edafa91aa	No. You would have to be the eldest son of the eldest son etc's wife|`|fkpyU4GBaa	It depends on the type of Duke he was, where he was a duke of, and the way in which the ducal title is transmitted.  <br>  <br>  If he were british and the dukedom was granted to 'heirs male' then female descendants can't claim to be duchesses.  If females can inherit the title, and you can prove that your father is the eldest son of his father, your grandfather is the eldest son of his father, and so on back to the duke; AND you are the eldest daughter without brothers then you could be a duchess after your father dies.<br>  <br>  If the duke was Russian (ie a Grand Duke), and the marriages of himself and his male line descendants were to women of equal status then you would be a Grand Duchess. If he were Austrian in the same senario you would be an Archduchess.  <br>  <br>  There are also some german royal families who are automatically entitled to use duke or duchess as their title from birth.<br>  <br>  Best suggestion find out where he was the duke of|`|MbaP0u6iaa	No. <br>  <br>  1. The title of "Duke of X", like "King of X", can belong to only one person at a time; that will be the head of the family. The title "Duchess of X" is reserved for the Duke's wife, although a Duke's widow can have the title "Dowager Duchess of X".<br>  <br>  The vast majority of European dukedoms pass through the male line only, so if you're female you couldn't inherit or transmit the title even if you were the eldest daughter of a duke.<br>  <br>  Conventions about titles for younger sons and daughters of dukes vary across Europe. In some countries they have courtesy titles - e.g. in Britain they would be Lord Firstname Surname and Lady Firstname Surname. But they cannot transmit those titles to their own children. So just being "a direct descendant of a duke" gets you nothing at all.

The Egyptians had a 10 day week with 36 weeks in the year and after the harvest they had 5 days rest and relaxation. I am not joking about the 7days I am sure it was a arbitrary as just that|`|XSEWADI0aa	The Bible does not specify the length of each of the creative periods. Yet all six of them have ended, it being said with respect to the sixth day (as in the case of each of the preceding five days): “And there came to be evening and there came to be morning, a sixth day.” (Ge 1:31) However, this statement is not made regarding the seventh day, on which God proceeded to rest, indicating that it continued. (Ge 2:1-3) Also, more than 4,000 years after the seventh day, or God’s rest day, commenced, Paul indicated that it was still in progress. At Hebrews 4:1-11 he referred to the earlier words of David (Ps 95:7, 8,?11) and to Genesis 2:2 and urged: “Let us therefore do our utmost to enter into that rest.” By the apostle’s time, the seventh day had been continuing for thousands of years and had not yet ended. The Thousand Year Reign of Jesus Christ, who is Scripturally identified as “Lord of the sabbath” (Mt 12:8), is evidently part of the great sabbath, God’s rest day. (Re 20:1-6) This would indicate the passing of thousands of years from the commencement of God’s rest day to its end. The week of days set forth at Genesis 1:3 to 2:3, the last of which is a sabbath, seems to parallel the week into which the Israelites divided their time, observing a sabbath on the seventh day thereof, in keeping with the divine will. (Ex 20:8-11) And, since the seventh day has been continuing for thousands of years, it may reasonably be concluded that each of the six creative periods, or days, was at least thousands of years in length.|`|F53OI3rkaa	Because its assumed God is a man, and hence can't multi-task by doing more than I thing in a day!<br>  (bear in mind tho, I think it was the egyptians and the romans who figured out the calendar as such as it is today)|`|tlJV1uBeaa	God wanted the mathematicians to question his creation.<br>  <br>  Spiritually speaking if there is a god, he certainly gives us enough to keep ourselves from boredom.|`|iY6GQsRUaa	Because he was trying to complete it during a moon phase (before the moon became full)|`|iYelQdukaa	It had to of been His choice... <br>  Be blessed.<br>  If Jesus returned Today,, do you know where you would<br>  Spend Eternity???|`|bfuYiSxfaa	he's lazy!  or under Union rules???|`|8Zey1ntAaa	Bah, simple human.

It is metaphor designed to talk about the government in hidden message so as not to be 'punished'. They did not have freedom of speech.<br>  I saw a program on these 'end time prophecies' once (I was flipping channels so I can't say which one). Anyway, there was a huge end time movement in the 1800's. A large part of the American population sold everything and some even built bomb shelters they were so convinced. Obviously, it has not happened. There's even a Bible verse where J. Christ says 'There are those standing here that will not see the coming of the second generation' (Matthew 13:30-I think but you can google it to be sure)<br>  There have been plenty of other end time prophecies. The verses used aways are vague enough to be connected to whatever is currently going on.|`|b23e3ca87d32dda5732ada9427cb2644aa	Yes and that everything man does and believes is covered.

Lots of guys piss me off in school, but non to the point where I write about them on y/a. How much time do you spend thinkng about her? You described her outfits, body, friends, and personality. I don't think I can even remember the first names of most the irritating people I go to school with, let alone their wardrobes.|`|wh3BAc4taa	She says "I guess so." because she wasn't feeling comfortable with people. Maybe she's an introvert and shy? Not everyone is sociable. <br>  <br>  If someone says "I guess so." to me, then I don't consider that rude or mean at all. It's not an insult. <br>  <br>  And how would you know that she didn't want to work with guys that wasn't up to her standards? Maybe she was texting because she was bored or uninterested? It has nothing to do with you, it was probably the assignment. <br>  <br>  Don't judge someone's personality based on ONE EXPERIENCE. Not all beautiful girls are rude and have awful personalities.|`|DQZK3eKfaa	She was probably uncomfortable without her friends....and you guys are probably really boring! And you said "she had to work with to guys that didn't add up to her standard", so don't you think if you were in a group with a bunch of boring girls who weren't as smart as you, you would be bored and be texting too. <br>  Don't act like all girls are like that. One girl wasn't interested in you....ooooh big deal!|`|CFFxtileaa	She might've been pissed cos she wasn't with her friends. It is VERY annoying when that happens.

2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	WOW, you must be really really smart.<br>  <br>  Maybe even as smart as  you think you are.<br>  <br>  In any case, I'm not that smart. I did make it into MENSA on the basis of my ACT and SAT scores back in the 80s. That puts me at about 138 on the IQ test (note that's a REAL IQ test, not the on line ones that give everyone who takes it a 174). I also have a law degree, but unlike you, I'm not to smart to believe in God. <br>  <br>  So you must really be smart.<br>  <br>  Being as smart as you are, I'd suggest you read, and then cleverly dissect, St. Thomas Aquinas' SUMMA THEOLOGICA. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/summa/" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/summa/</a><br>  Aquinas is often considered to be one of the greatest philosophers in the history of Western Civilization.  He has 5 proofs of the existance of God in there, based on pure  logic. Being as smart as you are, I bet you could make him look a dumb ox. <br>  <br>  As a warm up though, you might want to start by taking  apart  mathematician Kurt Godel's version of St. Anselm's Ontological Proof for the existance of God. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del's_ontological_proof" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del'...</a><br>  <br>  This is another good link to it <a href="http://www.geocities.com/sector114/htm/proof.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/sector114/htm/p...</a> <br>  <br>  I'm sure you know all about it, but for the folks who might read this and aren't as smart as you, here's  the history of the Ontological Proof. Saint Anselm (1033-1109) English theologian and archbishop of Canterbury presented the proof. René Déscartes (1596-1660) French philosopher and mathematician improved Anselm's proof. Gottfried Wilhelm Von Leibniz (1646 – 1716) German philosopher and mathematician improved Déscartes' proof. Charles Hartshorne (1897-2000) Professor of philosophy from the University of Texas (1962-1978) worked on logic of Saint Anselm's proof from 1923 in his Harvard Ph.D. thesis to 1965 that he wrote its revised version of the proof in his book "Re-examination of the ontological proof for God's existence".  Kurt G?del (1906 - 1978) German professor of mathematics in Princeton University improved Leibniz's proof.  Melvin Fitting professor of mathematics and logic in the City University of New York, Lehman College improved G?del's proof and formalized it with third order modal logic.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you will be able to make mincemeat out of those ignorant fools with that planet sized brain of yours. <br>  <br>  Now understand that To understand the proof it is required to gain knowledge of the following subjects first. One can obtain the knowledge by reading books or choosing the easier path of going to the nearest University, Math or Philosophy departments and taking necessary logic courses. List of some necessary books that cover the prerequisites can be found in the reference section.<br>  <br>  Prepositional logic <br>  Predicate logic <br>  Proof trees <br>  Modal logic <br>  Possible worlds semantics <br>  Mathematical set theory <br>  <br>  BUT...you were probably doing that straight out of nursery school.<br>  <br>  So go for it smart guy... enlighten the rest of us!|`|D9lMg7A2aa	So then you admit it is a matter of rationality !!

Evolution is an extremely slow process and hard to predict (which is why its called the THEORY of evolution) because no one has lived long enough to witness it and even in the history of intelligent human life, we haven't as a species lived long enough to record it.  At least not in the extremes you are thinking of in terms of this question.

All we're supposed to be able to have is a fish and you have sign some paperwork for it as does your room mate. <br>  <br>  The reason they feed us here is that some people are allergic to animals and that because the vents to all the dorm rooms are connected the dander will float around and send them into a bad reaction.

I remember arguing with one of them about some stuff in the archives at Suitland (the native american extension of the Smithsonians' archives). They were just sooooo positive that this red powder was used as an herb. I said "really? Then eat it. Devils club isn't very tasty when mixed with red clay. But go on ahead, prove it to me" of course, they said they couldn't eat an archival item. So I said "how about I bring you some? We use it to make paint. Face paint. You mix it with the bone marrow of a deer and the fat of a bear." they still were absolutely positive they were correct, and the "modern" indian was wrong....they were trying to claim the stuff was our version of a multi vitamin. Sooo stupid...not to mention the sanitary napkin used by women that they had labeled as a baby diaper (same material, I'll give them that, different weave) but no, they wouldn't listen to me about that either...when a person is an anthropologist, all the sudden they like to believe they are weavers, lingusits, historians, and natural chemists. The way I figure it,. if they were so wrong about some stupid face paint and sanitary napkins, what else do they have wrong with other people and cultures? They were totally off about some of the bigger things too, like the purpose behind certain house structures, the names of certain chiefs, and the origin of some tribal languages. Anyways, I know my people didn't come from some guy chasing mammoths accross a land bridge. I am going to need more evidence then some white guys word.

mOWyzwubaa	46:15 We enjoined the human being to honor his parents. His mother bore him arduously, gave birth to him arduously, and took intimate care of him for thirty months. When he reaches maturity, and reaches the age of forty, he should say, "My Lord, direct me to appreciate the blessings You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and to do the righteous works that please You. Let my children be righteous as well. I have repented to You; I am a submitter."<br>  <br>  <br>  This verse informs us that the sum of pregnancy and breastfeeding is 30 months. When evaluated together with verse 31:14 suggesting the time of breastfeeding as 24 months, it takes simple arithmetic to learn that the pregnancy of the person (nafs) to be 6 months. It is common knowledge that pregnancy is longer than that. We know from modern embryology that the exact time for a normal pregnancy is 266 days (see 77:23). There is extra information to be extracted from these natural and scriptural signs. If we subtract the 6 months, that is 180 days, from 266 days, we get 86 days. We can easily infer that the Quran does not accept the creature inside the womb to be a person (nafs) from the time of conception until the 86th day of pregnancy. Other verses support our inference. For instance, verse 22:5 and 23:14, which explain the evolution of the human being in four stages, does not use the word person (nafs) or human (insan) to describe the early stages of pregnancy. The four stages of pregnancy are (1) sperm; (2) embryo; (3) about four inch fetus (4) a new creature. It is clear that a new creation comes into existence after the 86th day. In other words, the emergence of consciousness/personhood (nafs) starts taking place in the brain of the fetus approximately three months after conception. Do we need to further add that reflecting on the ayat (signs) of the scripture together with the ayat (signs) of nature sheds light on the controversial issue of abortion? Also, see 16:58-59; 17:31|`|koynaDYbaa	Hey there,<br>  I done a similar thing at school but not regarding Islam - We did “Should Babies that have a Disability be Terminated?” <br>  This is mine.. Feel free =)   <br>  You can use some of my points if it helps...<br>  <br>  <br>  “Should Babies that have a Disability be Terminated?”<br>  <br>  Having a baby is a gift that God has given to everyone. Abortion is killing a child that cannot defend for themselves. If a mother feels that her unborn child will be disabled and she decides to abort it, that woman has no respect for life. A disabled child should receive the love that any other baby gets, be given the chance to look into the eyes of a loving family, or have a gentle touch from a caring heartful mother? Whether a baby is healthy or disabled, the mother should be strong enough to except an even special gift. The word ‘mother’ was given to us woman by God to come out of the lips and hearts of all children.<br>  <br>  Abortion performed on the grounds that the baby has a disability is usually regarded as being one of the most publicly acceptable reasons for abortion. Some polls suggest that as many as 75% of British people think abortion should be allowed for disability.<br>  <br>  In my opinion abortions cannot be dismissed simply as women freely “choosing” to abort, just as the diagnosis of a disability does not just “happen.” The act of aborting a child purely because of a disability I think is selfish on the parent’s behalf. How cruel do you have to be to terminate your own child, an equal human being who has the potential to do what ever he or she wants to, if they are able. Aborting a child, whether they are disabled or not is wrong, but I believe that if you abort a disabled baby how would you ever be acknowledged  into caring and loving a “normal” child?<br>  There will always be that guilt and even regret in the future. <br>  Although it is true that some women are pressurised into having an abortion, I don’t believe it should be an excuse. If you really loved your child, no matter who they were, a mother’s love would enable the mother to do everything to protect her offspring.<br>  <br>  Having an abortion for a disabled child, is often the option for parents who think the child will be too much for them to cope with. Everybody has the choice into whether they want to conceive a child or not. Why leave it to until the case where abortion is the only way out?<br>  You could also argue that nobody has the right to play God. Even people who are born, "normal" often become burdens on their parents and society - if we could know in advance that they too would be a burden, would it be wrong to abort them as well? I personally believe that God doesn’t give us anything we cannot handle.<br>  <br>  Unless the baby is born a vegetable, it can still have a fun & full life despite mental disabilities! Killing a baby because it will be deformed is very cruel, next we'll be aborting babies because obesity runs in their family!<br>  The child didn’t ask to be born, nor does it have a choice on how it looks and whether they have a disability. In actual fact, most disabilities a child may have are causes of the parent’s genes! I think people with disabilities are here to be loved, and honestly they are very special too. At the end of the day nobody is perfect.<br>  <br>  Another point of view against terminating disabled children is that there is no guarantee that a “normal” child will not later have an accident of some sort that will disable him or her. What would a parent do in that situation? If the child became handicapped or brain-dead, for example, from the incident would they simply kill the child because they can’t cope? Would the parent’s love stop up to the point of the accident? No, not necessarily, so what is there to prove that a disabled born baby wouldn’t be worth caring for or loving?<br>  Maybe we should kill all 80 year olds when they become an inconvenience! <br>  <br>  Also, you can't really know the extent of the disability until the baby is actually born - there have been cases where babies are diagnosed with Down's Syndrome and other conditions whilst in the womb, and have then been born healthy. Imagine the regret and guilt a mother or father would feel if they were to know that afterwards.<br>  <br>  In today’s society people who are racist, sexist, ageist, etc, are frowned upon. But ironically, many people still agree with abortion. Being racist, sexist and ageist means you dislike a particular person because they are different from yourself. Killing an unborn child is the same. What makes it worse is the fact some people terminate because the baby has a disability; what exactly makes a person disabled less equal and have fewer rights?<br>  <br>  In conclusion, I believe abortion/termination is murder. Every child deserves the chance to live, and many disabled children can still lead happy lives with support from their family. Killing the babies who are deemed to be "imperfect" is nothing more than eugenics (self-destruction of human beings), and I think we should try to look for the posit|`|757ce30489e7f56556925d17f1f49f76aa	Not necessarily.<br>  <br>  There is one circumstance where it is permissible, but still up to the mother if she wishes to have the baby or not, and that is if there is a risk of death to the mother if she has the baby. Other than that, abortion is not allowed.<br>  <br>  If it is for financial problems, Allah will provide for the person. And remember that there are always people who can not have babies, and they would be more than happy to adopt a child, IF the situation meant that the mother could not look after the baby. <br>  <br>  Why should the parents be allowed to murder the poor baby? The baby didn't do anything wrong.|`|UUT4rj3zaa	I dnt agree, coz in sum cases such az rape u mite not want the child or u mite not be able 2 look after this child, yet again I dnt agree coz u can give birth to the baby but if u dnt want the baby then u can give it a away to another family who is willing to take it, or give it to a foster hime.|`|l7UTyy9raa	Like 'She Said' said, there are circumstances where abortion is allowed but only things such as the mother's life being in danger.|`|0iTNDPzoaa	If it endangers the life of the mother then abortion is allowed and only under these conditions.|`|N8QLKpCMaa	Abortionis haram.<br>  <br>  but allowed when danger to woman life .<br>  not otherwise|`|UibsALccaa	Nope that is WRONG!

If the mothers life is in danger by carrying the pregnancy then her life as she has responsibilities is considered above that of an unborn child who has no responsibilities. Also if the fetus as has fatal abnormalities which would result in a term baby etc being born dead this would be most distressing for the mother and if it means an early detection could save her this distress at a later date then an early abortion is permitted for her. I feel sad that some Muslims are rejecting what Allah has made permissible, as with everything he does so for a reason. But of course an abortion just because you don't want it, its the "wrong" sex ( I know ) or you cannot afford it are never reasons to kill your child. Allah knows best Insha Allah.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also I would just like to point out this does not include babies with disabilities, this is not permissible at all.

They have not gone into details concerning cases where the pregnancy results from immorality. This may be because they consider that to come under the same ruling as abortion of a pregnancy resulting from a proper marriage. If abortion of a pregnancy resulting from a proper marriage is haraam under normal circumstances, then it is even more so in cases where the pregnancy results from immorality, because permitting abortion of pregnancy which results from immorality would encourage evil actions and the spread of immorality. One of the basic principles of Islam is that it forbids immorality and all the ways that lead to it, e.g., it forbids tabarruj (wanton display of one’s charms) and free mixing (of men and women). <br>  In addition, an innocent foetus which has committed no sin should not be sacrificed because of a sin committed by someone else. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <br>  “No one laden with burdens can bear another’s burden” <br>  [al-Israa’ 17:15] <br>  It is known that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent the Ghaamidi woman who was pregnant as a result of zinaa away until she gave birth, then after the birth he sent her away until she had breastfed the child and weaned him. She came back with the child who had a piece of bread. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave the child to one of the Muslims, then he gave orders that she should be placed in a hole up to her chest, and commanded the people to stone her. Imaam al-Nawawi said concerning this hadeeth: “A pregnant woman should not be stoned until she gives birth, whether her pregnancy is the result of zina or otherwise. This is agreed upon, lest her foetus be killed. The same applies if her hadd punishment is flogging; a pregnant woman should not be flogged, according to consensus, until she has given birth.” (Saheeh Muslim bi Sharh al-Nawawi, 11/202) <br>  This incident shows us the extent to which Islam is concerned with the foetus, even if it is the result of zina: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) delayed the carrying out of the hadd punishment on the mother in order to save the life of the foetus. <br>  Can it be imagined that the Lawgiver would permit killing the foetuses by abortion in order to fulfil the wishes of those who follow their whims and desires? <br>  Furthermore, those who say that abortion is permitted within the first forty days of a legitimate pregnancy based their ijtihaad on a concession, like not fasting in Ramadaan for those who have valid excuses, or shortening the four-rak’ah prayers whilst travelling, but it is stated in sharee’ah that concessions cannot be connected to sins. <br>  Imaam al-Quraafi said: “With regard to sins, they cannot be taken as reasons for concessions. Hence one who is travelling for the purpose of sin cannot shorten his prayers or break his fast, because the reason for doing these is travelling, but in this case the reason for travelling is to commit sin, so the concession does not apply, because granting a concession on the basis of sin will encourage people to sin further.” (al-Furooq, 2/33) <br>  Similarly, the basic principles of Islamic sharee’ah do not give the same concessions to a woman who is pregnant as a result of zinaa as are given to a woman who is pregnant as a result of proper marriage, lest that help her in her sin, and it does not make it easy for her to get rid of the results of her evil actions. <br>  In addition, the foetus in the case of zinaa has no guardian, because according to sharee’ah the title of father can only be given to the one who has a child from a woman in a proper marriage. This is part of the meaning of the hadeeth: “The child goes to the owner of the bed and the adulterer gets nothing but the stones (despair, i.e. to be stoned to death).” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim). The guardian of the foetus in such cases is the sultan or ruler – the one who is in charge of the Muslims’ affairs – for he is the guardian of those who have no guardian. The way in which the ruler disposes of people’s affairs is based on the interests of the people, and there is no interest to be served in destroying the soul of the foetus in order to preserve the mother’s interests, because that would involve encouraging her and others to persist in this evil action. <br>  It is permissible to resort to aborting the foetus of a woman who has committed this evil action but now wants to repent sincerely, and is very afraid. This is a major principle of sharee’ah, and is subject to the condition that this be done as early in the pregnancy as possible, and that this fatwa be given only in individual cases and not be treated as a general fatwa, lest this concession becomes a means of encouraging evil in the Muslim society. And Allaah knows best. <br>  From Ahkaam al-Janeen fi’l-Fiqh al-Islami by ‘Umar ibn Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem Ghaanim<br>  <a href="http://www.islamqa.com/en/ref/13331/abortion" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamqa.com/en/ref/13331/abor...</a>|`|7Q33v5hOaa	I don't agree.<br>  I believe abortion is only allowed if the mothers life is in danger because it is the lesser of 2 evils.

Matt 10:14 Jesus taught "..whoever will not receive you nor hear your words, when you depart from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.."<br>  Jesus was teaching the 12 Apostles and preparing them to be sent out to preach His word.  Referenced also in Acts 13:49-51 inclusive.|`|89MKzLl3aa	Some Christians feel that it's their duty to save those who don't believe. But, I do agree with you that no means no.

God has never preserved Qur'an. Many 'revealed' verses of the Qur'an were later changed---supposedly by 'Allah' after he realized that he should not have included them in the Qur'an or when a better idea came to him. In some cases some verses were either totally forgotten or their correct recitations were forgotten and new ones brought.<br>  <br>  A verse in the Qur'an Al-Baqara: tries to rationalize and justify these serious scandal that impliy weakness in God. However, the verse ended up confirming, by default, that the Qur'an has actually been tampered with.<br>  <br>  The Al-Baqara: 106 reads, "Whatever a verse (revelation) do Nansakh (We abrogate) or Nunsiha (cause to be forgotten), We bring a better one or similar to it.

Before a theory is given any credence in the scientific community, it must be subjected to "peer review." This means that the proposed theory must be published in a legitimate scientific journal in order to provide the opportunity for other scientists to evaluate the relevant factual information and attempt to duplicate any experimental procedures involved.<br>  <br>  Creationists refuse to subject their "theories" to peer reviews, because they know they don't fit the facts. The creationist mindset is distorted by the concept of "good science" (creationism) vs. "bad science" (anything not in agreement with creationism). Creation "scientists" are biblical fundamentalists who can not accept anything contrary to their sectarian religious beliefs.<br>  <br>  Creationism is NOT a theory<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  The U.S. Constitution is a secular document. It begins, "We the people," and contains no mention of "God" or "Christianity." Its only references to religion are exclusionary, such as, "no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust" (Art. VI), and "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof" (First Amendment). The presidential oath of office, the only oath detailed in the Constitution, does not contain the phrase "so help me God" or any requirement to swear on a bible (Art. II, Sec. 1, Clause 8). If we are a Christian nation, why doesn't our Constitution say so?<br>  <br>  In 1797 America made a treaty with Tripoli, declaring that "the government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion."

You will see them bow and prostrate themselves.... (Al-Fatih)<br>  Through telling of the elevated qualities and characteristics which were the reason for the Companions being the most elevated of human kind after the prophets, the start of this verse describes through its explicit meaning the excellent qualities which would mark the class of the Companions. And through its implied meaning, the verse alludes to the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, who would succeed to the office of the Prophet (PBUH) after his death through the institution of the Caliphate, and gives news of the fine attributes which were what most distinguished each of them and marked them out. It is as follows:<br>  And those who are with him alludes to Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, who was distinguished and famous for being among the Prophet’s special followers and party to his conversation, and again for entering among his special followers by being the first to die. While are strong against the unbelievers points to Umar, who in the future would cause the countries of the globe to tremble at his conquests, and with his justice would descend on tyrants like a thunderbolt. And compassionate among each other gives news of Uthman, who, in the future when the most serious dissension was being fomented, would sacrifice his own life and spirit out of perfect kindness and compassion so that the blood of Muslims should not be spilt, preferring to be martyred wrongfully while reading the Qur’an. And so too, You will see them bow and prostrate themselves [in prayer], seeking grace from God and [His] good pleasure tells that with his complete worthiness to undertake the Caliphate and government, and his heroism, and his choosing perfect asceticism, worship, poverty, and frugality, and whose bowing and prostrating in prayer was corroborated by everyone, Ali (May God be pleased with him) was not responsible for his position in the future and the wars and strife in which he was involved, and that his intention and wish was for Divine favour.
LcYeN6m5aa	I think any major event in people's lives, where they have new responsibilities and seriousness, will change how they view morality - not just having kids.<br>  <br>  Becoming an attorney, becoming a police officer, owning a home, owning a brand new car, getting married, getting divorced, changing religions....<br>  <br>  We're all in constant change - constant flux - <br>  <br>  We also see parents who when they have kids go over the edge unprepared for the responsibility, who start partying.  We also see parents who "partied" before they had kids who continue to do acid, smoke weed, etc,. who don't change.  <br>  <br>  So, to answer your question in a psychologically academically sound manner that is academically responsible and accurate:  <br>  <br>  It all depends.  <br>  <br>  There are trends, but they don't all go in the same direction.<br>  <br>  It also depends on the background of the person and whether the pregnancy was wanted, and the morals of the support system - those can affect it too.<br>  <br>  If this was to be a research question - it would probably be more appropriately narrow:<br>  <br>  Do kids who grow up in religiously/morally conservative, healthy functioning homes with two parents, find their morality becoming more conservative upon having children in wedlock? <br>  <br>  Or the con:<br>  <br>  A sample of 216 parents, 100 male 116 female, with 1/2 each coming from morally conservative traditional families, and 1/2 each coming from broken homes having suffered childhood abuse, were studied to determine fi upon having children, their moral values and judgments changed, either positively or negatively.  <br>  <br>  The definitions of positive and negative are defined below in graph 3c using a series of questions from the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI)(Davis, 2000, p.5-6)......blah blah blah.<br>  <br>  So in the end, interesting question, but I dont' know that the responses you got would neccessarily be representative of anything other than to say some people may agree with you and some don't. <br>  <br>  There are obviously going to be people who didn't change, and some in the grips of an addiction BEFORE childbirth, who got worse!   Is that due to the children?  Or is that due to the drugs? <br>  <br>  I know for me, I became more conservative in some things, but I can see the reason for it, not because of the kids, but because I was prepared for that by my parents BEFORE I had kids.......<br>  <br>  However, Y!A isn't all that academically sound - and is more pop-social-psychology than it is accurate in many instances, but it's a good question!   One I'd be interested to see the research on!|`|PAA4uWPuaa	When I found out I was pregnant I stopped partying.<br>  Also I don't smoke weed anymore, not because I have a moral disliking to it but because I can't be a good parent from jail. <br>  Seriously when my kids move out I plan to resume smoking pot. <br>  <br>  I think becoming a parent made me grow up, not change morals. <br>  I have seen many parents that don't change at all though. <br>  <br>  This has nothing to do with belief in god in my opinion.|`|QMbaeva9aa	I think so. Parents want what's best for their kid, but this only applies if the parents -wanted- the kids in the first place.<br>  Yes, religion would change things. For example, Christian parents would probably be stricter with rules about drinking and dating than atheist parents.<br>  <br>  I used to have two Muscovy ducklings. They were so cute!<br>  (do you have actual ducklings, or three children?)|`|AA10031161	I don't know that the essence of one's morals (perception of right/wrong) change..... but I'd bet that in many cases, priorities change... and that may be the key.|`|AA10096992	It changes their behavior, and often makes them more sanctimonious, but not necessarily more moral.|`|OywIJxobaa	no|`|S4XUl7qWaa	It depends, really. Having a child didn't change my morals because my morals were already pretty solid. It did change how much I focused on myself though, which was hard because when my first child was born I was only 20 years old, barely an adult myself.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say that a parent who stops partying when their kid is born has changed his or her morals though, I would think it was more accurate to say they changed their priorities and their behavior. Maybe they still think that partying is great, they just do it less often because they have a little one to take care of and changing diapers with a hangover kind of sucks.|`|yAvTxh47aa	Eh. I went from being a dabbling Wiccan to a serious Wiccan after my son was born, mostly because I stopped having a social life...that leaves time for thinking.<br>  <br>  My view is that whether having a kid, "finding god" or nearly dying is what it takes for someone to grow up, as long as they grow up, it's good.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, I know many parents who are still in the immature "I am not responsible for what I do" phase of life, whether they blame their lack of responsibility on sin, spirits, booze, drugs, mental illness, it doesn't matter...until they do what they need to be self-responsible (quit, get a therapist, start a drug, stop a drug, use in moderation, whatever) they are terrible parents.|`|ubeFAYLPaa	I wouldn't say it changes your morals, more like it re-focuses your morality a bit.<br>  The reason is because when you have a child, you now have something which is more important to you than anything else, including your own self.<br>  <br>  Difference between athiests and theists?  I guess that many theists put their deity ahead of all else in the world.  I have definittely heard this amongst some Christians, not sure about other faiths.|`|AA12136918	yes  because  you have  to put the child  before  yourself  very  few  can carry on the way they had  been living befor the child  was born  even  just going to  the shops  can become    difficult.|`|xo4iux9gaa	No; but sometimes going crazy is hereditary....you get it from your kids.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Yes, it certainly does...and I think it is because even the most dull of people see the super-moral responsibility in being the one who is responsible for an innocent child acting right or wrong, or loving or hating God, or things like that. <br>  <br>  <br>  The worst people in the world still tend to not allow rotten things IF IT INVOLVES A CHILD.<br>  <br>  To be a godless immoral person is nothing compared to being the cause of a child being raised that way.|`|TzY9vkinaa	I think it does, and it happens to atheists as well. You start to look at the things you do/say/watch/listen to and think "would I want my child to do/see/watch/hear this?" and many people will change if the answer is no.  Others will only watch what they do in front of their child.|`|Et011ogJaa	I would think most of  the time....yes....because to experience parenthood is to put the law of sacrifice into motion...which increases a persons knowledge beyond them self.....to look outside of self is an act of love and love always shapes our morals. The greater amount of love a person has the higher moral standard they will live.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	it was a huge change for me in awareness, selflessness and being cautious.<br>  <br>  I personally think it would be hard to teach morals to kids without teaching God as well.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	1. No. I think a "parent" set of morals which has been developing over time becomes manifest.<br>  <br>  2. No. The process is the same. We digest our experiences with our own parents, and develop a "list" of do/do not do codes, take in information from around us, digest, make a best guess, and go with that. Our personalities do not really change in that process. I would guess the most apparent difference between atheists and theists is how much emphasis is placed on religious-based ideas of parent-child relationships.<br>  <br>  I agree that people tend to change some behaviors suddenly, even such as not cursing and swearing, being more deliberate with finances, etc., but I go back to my first point; all that is already in place.

Just because I happen to care about someone doesn't mean they're above the law.|`|EXurNsB4aa	It's hard to say.  It depends on circumstances, and what I would actually do could differ greatly from what I think I would do.  I think I would turn them in.  There is no guarantee they will face life in prison or anything, and if it was a crime of passion or something like that, I guess they could get a lighter sentence (I would use that to try and deal with the idea of them going to jail forever, which would be very painful for me).  If they were a cold-blooded serial killer or something, I definitely would turn them in.|`|Ovj7Nf25aa	I am a Christian and I adore my two sons,...but I raised them under the terms that if I ever get to know that they do *anything* against the law, I will investigate myself and if I confirm it, I will call the police on them and will give the police all the evidence I were able to gather.  <br>  <br>  I taught them that the law and the rules MUST be respected and that there are "lawful" ways to fight a rule and/or a law that we don't agree with, violating it, it's not lawful in any way.  My sons are grown ups and I still repeat the same words every now and then and I still stand behind those words.|`|SQ6FVuuXaa	I would hide them under the bed and when the police came I would say, "no I have never seen that person before in my life".

Wt398Yueaa	I went to Catholic schools from 1961 to 1971 and at that time the idea of Limbo was part of the religion. Babies who died before they could be baptised went there. They were happy, but Limbo was an inferior place to Heaven. This seemed very unfair, so the rules were changed at the Vatican Conference. Several ways were invented for babies to get into Heaven rather than Limbo. One was called 'baptism by desire': if the parents had wanted the child to be baptised then that was enough. It was all very confusing; I asked one of the monks at school if it was still possible for anyone to end in Limbo. He said that although the Catholic Church still taught that such a place existed, as far as he could tell it was no longer possible to end up there. He admitted that this did not make much sense.<br>  <br>  I am not surprised to learn from some of the other answers that the idea of Limbo has now been dropped by the church. The doctrines of the church have changed drastically over the centuries - though they never told us THAT when I was at school!|`|4644ec1ac391913c8f074e3b205f8168aa	How childish and blasphemous.<br>  <br>  Limbo asserts that God somehow doesn't know what to do with the souls that are His and has to somehow forget about them, though of course not so that they are unhappy, souls who He has given life to and ordered their circumstances and yet He is unable to accomplish His purposes on Earth and is caught out by their unexpected deaths, which apparently He couldn't do anything about.<br>  <br>  Purgatory asserts that you can get a second chance where you don't have a choice in the matter, and so makes out God to be playing games and having to accept those who are obviously unacceptable but for a show making out they've been taught a lesson which He was somehow unable to teach them on Earth.<br>  <br>  They both sound like the fanciful ideas of a child's mind.<br>  <br>  Neither are worthy of serious examination and neither have any foundation in the Bible and both blaspheme against God's Omnipotence and Omniscience.<br>  <br>  The real difference between unreal inventions?<br>  <br>  Why not rather read what God says in the Bible?|`|0EkJQEV9aa	Limbo is the place where unbaptized people go if they have not willing known about their sins, or have been depraved of the Catholic religion.

It started when I mentioned my discomfort at the attitude taken by a Catholic speaker who refers disparagingly to the new Catechism of the Catholic Church and who cites approvingly only the Roman Catechism, which grew out of the Council of Trent. <br>  <br>  My e-mail acquaintance said the other fellow was right to do so, since the new catechism contains “novel teachings.” “What might those be?” I asked. As one example, he said the new catechism does not mention limbo. <br>  <br>  Under the older understanding, he noted unbaptized infants who die, whether through miscarriage or abortion, enjoy complete natural happiness but do not see God face to face. They are not in heaven or hell but in a third state, limbo. Under the “novel teaching” of the new catechism, limbo is not mentioned, but it is said we can hope that God has made some provision through which such infants might get to heaven.<br>  <br>  In the Middle Ages theologians came up with the theological construct of limbo, which never has been a defined doctrine. Limbo does get around two sticking points: the absence of sanctifying grace, which implies no possibility of heaven, and the absence of personal guilt, which implies no hell. Unbaptized infants die with neither, so it might seem that they are destined neither for heaven nor hell. <br>  <br>  The new catechism implies that the infants might be able to achieve sanctifying grace before their particular judgment, though how this might happen we cannot say with any certitude. Some theologians speculate that the infants are given an opportunity not unlike that once granted the angels, before their fall, to accept or reject God. But we just do not know—and perhaps we never will know, down here.<br>  <br>  My e-mail correspondent said, “Well, I think I’ll stick with the solution suggested by the older catechism and will reject the ‘novel’ solution of the new catechism.” Why do that? I asked. Because the old solution is older, he said. <br>  <br>  G. K. Chesterton noted that truth is not chronologically determined. The century of a teaching’s promulgation is not an argument for or against it. An old teaching is not necessarily truer for being old, and a new teaching is not necessarily truer for being new. Copernicus happened to be right, and Ptolemy wrong, about the motions of the planets, even though the former’s teaching was considered “novel.” Of course, it is as easy to point to older beliefs that are truer than their modern substitutes.<br>  <br>  Catechisms are not infallible documents. The Roman Catechism may have erred on the fate of unbaptized infants, and it may be that the new catechism, which offers no particular solution but just a generalized hope, is nevertheless closer to the right answer. It might be better to go with the “novel” teaching, which is more vague, and set aside the “traditional” teaching, which, some say, suggests a deficiency in God’s mercy. <br>  <br>  Where does that leave us? In limbo, so to speak. A Catholic may accept limbo, or he may reject it. He is not a better or worse Catholic for doing one or the other. But he does need to think through the problem—where do unbaptized infants go, and how does his solution, whatever it may be, square with God’s justice and mercy (both together, not just one taken separately)? <br>  <br>  <br>   A little on Purgatory:<br>  Purgatory<br>  <br>  <br>  The Catechism of the Catholic Church defines purgatory as a "purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven," which is experienced by those "who die in God’s grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified" (CCC 1030). It notes that "this final purification of the elect . . . is entirely different from the punishment of the damned" (CCC 1031). <br>  <br>  The purification is necessary because, as Scripture teaches, nothing unclean will enter the presence of God in heaven (Rev. 21:27) and, while we may die with our mortal sins forgiven, there can still be many impurities in us, specifically venial sins and the temporal punishment due to sins already forgiven. <br>  <br>    <br>  Two Judgments<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  When we die, we undergo what is called the particular, or individual, judgment. Scripture says that "it is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgment" (Heb. 9:27). We are judged instantly and receive our reward, for good or ill. We know at once what our final destiny will be. At the end of time, when Jesus returns, there will come the general judgment to which the Bible refers, for example, in Matthew 25:31-32: "When the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate them one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats." In this general judgment all our sins will be publicly revealed (Luke 12:2–5). <br>  <br>  Augustine said, in The City of God, that "temporary punishments are suffered by some in this life|`|68lLAQnKaa	catholics believe that Purgatory is Limbo, you hang out there in limbo until the second coming... not true though... the bible will tell you correctly, let me know if you want more info...|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	cheesepuff is right. you should give best answer to her.|`|xelkbdbdaa	Spelling... and the lack of reference to them in Scripture.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Purgatory has been a teaching of the Christian Church from the very beginning.  It is an integral part of God's plan of salvation.  Limbo was never an official teaching of the Church.  It was just a popular notion that grew up in an effort to explain what might happen to innocent children who die without benefit of baptism.  the Bible plainly states that one canno enter the kingdom without baptism, so the Limbo idea kind of caught on.  The Pope recently discouraged belief in it since it is not official teaching of the Church, and therefore does not have a divine guarantee of truth like the deoctrina of Purgatory.|`|yHfsHp6naa	Purgatory is somewhere you go to dance the limbo.|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	well limbo was a concept and NEVER dogma of the church.<br>  <br>  purgatory is a word given to the concept of what happens when we die. scriptures discate (sorry don't have my notes for references hand) that we all stand before the judgement, that some sins are forgiven in THIS life (implying some in the next) and that we will be tested/metted in fire to be purified.  THAT is what purgatory is all about -- that time when we are being judged, tested and purified.<br>  <br>  EDIT -- taught?!?  by whom? i went to 12 years of catholic school and it was NEVER taught there by the nuns.  that was the only thing that they knew at the time - they wanted to give grieving parents some sort of relief when they lost a child so quickly after birth.  we're not talking recent history on this but well in the past.  <br>  <br>  For purgatory insight check out 2 Cor 5:10, Heb 9:27 & 28 & 12:23, 1 Cor 3:15, Heb 12:29, 1 Pet 1:7, Mt 25:31-46 we will be judged after our death, we will be tested in fire. Where is God going to do this – in heaven? Once we are admitted into heaven – we’re in  ; ) since we do not know God’s time as it is not our time, until we die, who truly, are we to say.<br>  <br>  amazing - all the thumbs down to the CATHOLICS who answered what you asked.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	::EDIT::<br>  OK,  reading Galatic Emperor's answer - he gets 5 stars.  I forgot to say that the Catholic church does not dogmatically state the belief in Limbo one way or another. I also forgot about Limbo of the Patriarchs, etc.  -- He copied and pasted..but found a REALLY good source. So he gets 5 stars! <br>  Bravo!  <br>  _______<br>  Limbo --  the theological construct to describe where souls who have not sinned themselves go until the end of time. It was developed by Theologians to answer the question of where do babies go if they die very early on before they are baptized.  Example, a women gives birth to a still born baby.  Does the baby, who has original sin, but has committed no sin on their own, go immediately to heaven OR to hell?  Theologians theorized they went to Limbo until the end of time. The bible does not directly comment on the baby scenario above..so that is why theologians had to use their scholarly knowledge to GUESS at an answer.  It is not authoritative nor definitive. There is even debate over whether or not babies suffer any in limbo.  Some say they feel NOTHING,  others say they feel only Earthly happiness, but not Heavenly happiness.  -- REALLY no one knows if it even exists. <br>  <br>  Purgatory - There is some verses in the bible which talk about a 'purging by fire' of the 'righteous" this comes AFTER death.  It are these verses that led to the Catholic churches belief in Purgatory, that some of us, will have to work off the temporal punishment of our earthly sins,  even though they have been forgiven.  Kinda like a parent saying.. I forgive you for breaking the window...but there is still a hole in the window,  so you are going to have to do house chores until you work off the cost of replacing the window.  Purgatory is like that.  ONLY the righteous go there..so ALL of them are destined for heaven as their sins have been forgiven,  BUT there is STILL a temporal punishment for their transgressions. <br>  So the idea in some bible verses is that some righteous, who are destined for heaven undergo a 2nd purging before entering heaven.  What exactly this is,  how long, etc.  We don't know.  <br>  In the book of 2nd Macabbees there are some verses concerning Purgatory.   This is somewhat ironic, because MANY Protestants say there is NO biblical support for Purgatory, yet it is the Protestants who split OFF from the Catholic church who actually threw OUT the some of the support for Purgatory in the 1600s when they changed the OT and got rid of 7 books of the OT which they considered "apocrypha" or suspicious.   So in a way, they partially removed evidence for something they centuries later claim is "unbiblical"<br>  <br>  Read more here:  <a href="http://www.catholic.com/library/Purgatory.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholic.com/library/Purgator...</a>|`|tfuPCVzOaa	Nothing, they are both false!<br>  <br>  There is either Heaven or Hell.

Most of the people who answered so far are at least aware it happens and they're also aware that society works so that men are ashamed or afraid to admit to being a victim of abuse.  Male on male abuse is an issue too and is addressed to some extent within the LGBT community.<br>  <br>  I don't think that organizations that assist female victims of abuse necessarily need or should take on the issue of male domestic abuse.  Male allies of those organizations should be urged to found their own organizations and support groups.  I also think that we should be aware that it's still extremely hard for any victim of abuse, man woman or child, to come to terms with it and tell people about it.  <br>  <br>  Police often don't take any abuse claims seriously.  It's very often that someone will make a call, the police will come, and leave, and the abuse starts again.

If you are still determined to do what you set your goal to after hearing what those people have to say then you are a better human being than most.<br>  Good luck with your endeavors and ambitions, I know I sound like a hard-*** but I am rooting for you and it is not going to be an easy road.|`|cc0IPV6Iaa	you mean like with a place to live as well?

Just a thought.|`|szA2U2Tmaa	I honestly think your going to have trouble with this.<br>  i Mean i think its a great idea, but just think of all the people who are gonig to bring you down.<br>  <br>  But i agree 100% with you, i think you should try it.

Think what you are saying.  Your logic would mean that we can choose how to live, but shouldn't be blamed if we lose our temper and kill that person we're mad at.<br>  <br>  No.  It is your responsibility to decide how to live your life.  Actions will always have consequences.  And you're right, we do disobey God.  He understands this.  That is why He gave His only begotten son, to die on the cross to pay for all your sins.<br>  <br>  The astonishing thing is, is how angry people get about this, how they will not admit their bad choices are their own responsibility, and how they will not accept Jesus as their savior.  What does it cost you?|`|2d2ZuimCaa	Man chooses to go in his own way and thinking- just like a child of a parent / The parent knows best but not according to the child. God is willing to forgive us and help us Only if one asks for the forgiveness and will to try to abide by Gods rules.He wants to be their to help us.|`|AA12288361	Every "free will" decision comes with either a blessing or a curse. <br>  <br>  If you used your "free will" to jump off a building, would GOD ever try to stop you?

If you neglect your conscience, you will probably jump and that would seal your fate.<br>  <br>  Every decision made will be evaluated by GOD!<br>  <br>  GOD bless|`|UL3XOKJxaa	My car has a speedometer that reads 160...should I be punished for using it?

Satan did.<br>  <br>  God created man without the knowledge of good or evil. Without being able to tell the difference, man couldn't choose to do evil, but could *only* do exactly what god wanted him to do...Satan, in getting man to sin by eating of the tree of knowledge, gave man the ability to now choose. <br>  <br>  So, God created robots, Satan helped us to be able to think for ourselves.|`|r3TYEHMbaa	Free will doesn't mean no responsibility. It means you make your own choices. There are right and wrong choices. Right choices have good consequences; wrong choices have bad consequences. It's not just in religion; it's in life in general.<br>  How old are you?|`|d7417f76fabaaeaca09baa21844aa149aa	You might want to form that into a real question instead of a rant.<br>  You might make a point, you might have an argument.|`|ATsdSM7saa	Just one of the many irreconcilable flaws in the God hypothesis.|`|654d3871e3f2b2c74ca8fdf30e377c9baa	You can chose..yes<br>  But if you chose wrong...well then that is on you|`|AA10652430	I always hear the "Free Will" speech whenever I say I don't really believe in a God who would let good ppl suffer.|`|uAMzmAwaaa	God gave us free will, but like with everything there are consequences for every choice you make with that free will... God being Holy and Just has to punish evil. so if you do evil he will punish you... the reason why he gave us free will is so we have the ability to choose to love him or not, he won't force us to make choices, but just like any loving parent, you disobey the rules and he will punish you.<br>  <br>  also unlike the case was with Adam and Eve, we know what happens when sin comes into the world, and when we get to heaven we will know what it is like without the corruption of sin, and the difference is so great we won't want to sin, ever.<br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  the Bible is clear we won't be in heaven forever, as according to the Bible after the tribulation those in heaven will come back down to earth for the 1000 year kingdom, then after the 1000 years and the final attempt to overthrow God by Satan there will be a "new heaven and earth" out of the ashes of the old ones and it will be much like how it was in the Garden of Eden.|`|wRBfUgI2aa	Consider in today's imperfect world, we have 10s of thousands of laws.  No one can go even half a day without violating one or more of them.<br>  <br>  Adam & Eve were created perfect in mind, body and spirit.  God only gave them one simple law to show His right to impose His rulership.  simply to not eat of one fruit tree out of many.  God thoroughly explained the benefits and consequences of obeying the 1 law.  It was then always up to them to decide what to do.<br>  <br>  With us, God knows all about our imperfections and does not expect us to be perfect.  He does expect us to try to live according to the standards God set up for imperfect humankind.  Through the Ransom sacrifice of Jesus, we have provision for forgiveness of sins by sincerely asking God for it with Jesus as mediator between God and imperfect humanity.<br>  <br>  None of us are robots.  We have the choice to make in serving either God or Satan.  All of our lives boil down to the simplest terms as this.  We need to all learn of the rewards and consequences of both sides of actions.|`|0vDC99t0aa	i don't know where you have heard that from but i am a christian and god does not give us free will because he didn't want robots. who ever told you that was wrong <br>   <br>  oh  god does not get mad at us he loves us very much every one of us no matter what we are like the devil the is the one who hates us <br>  remember that boy are girl. god does good. Devil does bad|`|qJdWKcSQaa	Not sure, but a very good question.  I'm sure part of it has to do with something like not yelling fire in a crowed theater or yelling bomb on an airplane (there are limits to our freedom).  But that only answers part of your question.  Otherwise, I don't think anyone will be able to give you a satisfactory answer.<br>  <br>  I certainly would NOT look for an answer on this website if I were you . . .|`|FOzN3xwzaa	You do have free choice. <br>  <br>  Believe in Jesus alone for salvation and go to heaven, or go to your death without having believed, and be sent to eternal torment in hell. <br>  <br>  You face similar choices every day.  Walk on the sidewalk and you're fine.  Walk in the middle of the freeway, and get hit by a car and killed. <br>  <br>  Which one is wise, should be obvious.|`|3ccd31e0b38f18f3123974ce88fcb948aa	You really don't know the deal, do you?  Your perception is way off, little one.<br>  <br>  Esther and Barney gace great answers.  By the way, you are NOT right.<br>  <br>  Your generalizations are illogical.  You need to take a course in logic.  Hasty generalizations are unintelligent.|`|qNVP4Q1Saa	Just ask him.|`|iHLt9Juyaa	Yes He did give us free will. He also gave His Sons life as a ransom. Jesus came as God in the flesh, to teach, to suffer, to die and to save us, because we can't seem to obey Him. Jesus took on the sins of the world from the beginning of time to the end. And He only asked us to believe what He did for us.<br>  He will always take us back, because He loves you and He loves me. Yes, you are right, we do disobey Him, but He still loves us.<br>  Does that sound like an angry unreasonable God?<br>  No, He has control of this situation, and you will see it one day.<br>  God bless you.

08H81poqaa	It all comes down to "family".  Religion is just another name for a large family.  We suffer because we are not part of that family who wants us to conform to their ways or be who they want us to be.<br>  <br>  We cannot return to the "average joe" or "robotic-like" life. We are more spiritual when we are around a "family" of positive people who lift us up.  So I guess you are implying that "religion" is a specific religion or church.<br>   <br>  Being "awake" or enlightened we become more spiritual and less religious.  Our relationship with God does not suffer, but our pain becomes more enhanced because others who are dead in themselves inflict us with their "unknown" suffering.<br>  <br>  Peace.<br>  amanda|`|n3Rx3PYyaa	.<br>  Personally, I feel that organized religion HINDERS spirituality and don't feel that religion helps with being more spiritual.<br>  <br>  The One Light (God) is Love...not religion.<br>  <br>  Ask the questions..."What would Love do?"...OR..."What would Religion do"?<br>  Relating as person of Love or person of Religion?<br>  Which one of those two resonates naturally with what's messaged and taught to us by the One Light (God)?  Religion once a week, sitting in prayer, carrying out "acts" and rituals. . .OR...Relating as person of wisdom and Love in day to day life with self and others?<br>  <br>  Ask those questions.  In there you will find the answer.<br>  .|`|2u8teJkJaa	You should be with other believers to socialize but I find they are only human too. I don't care for the same old thing on Sunday that become tedious.

(Can't fit in cuz I see no proof...)|`|f47721b80bdc2a87085e7e08a5558029aa	I think thats a personal question.  Some people enjoy being with others who have similar thoughts, to share and encourage each other.  Some, however, find it more benficial to try to forge that relationship on their own to make it more of a personal bond.  For younger kids, I think group worship is best to help them understand the benefits of a relation with a higher being.  Once a person gets older though, I think it is up to them to decide whether thay are satisfied with what religion has brought, or if they'd like to take time to see what else lies out there.|`|SAqZbQqCaa	Organized religion is like any other organization of like minded people.<br>  It's what people do. They assimilate into like minded groups, establish guidelines for organization, make policies and rules to govern themselves by, and either do a good or bad job at holding it all together.<br>  Whether it helps or hinders might start at the top.<br>  After all, leadership is the key.<br>  Jesus was such a powerful one that business books have been written using his principles as guidelines.<br>  But in the end spirituality is an individual growth.|`|46q6xyKmaa	The main thing about attending a church is that you have Christian fellowship and that seems to be pretty important as a Christian, to be able to share your faith.  I don't believe it is necessary to attend a church to Be a Christian however. To each his own I suppose.  I don't see how our personal relationship with God can suffer unless it is a far-out religion that strays from the truths of the Bible and we find ourselves turning to them for answers instead of God.|`|z2YcXSvZaa	it hinders spirituality because it doesn't allow you to worship God and think for yourself. when people speak of other people forcing their religion on others, they speak of organized religion.|`|fHpPgMlZaa	It seems to hinder most of the religionists I know.<br>  <br>  Gandhi said it best"I like your Christ but not Christians".

There was a recorded 911 call of a girl no older then 8 calling 911 because she need help with...I believe it was math. She called 911 because her mom told her to call someone to help her with homework. Now when a parents says that to a kid they can call the homework hotline. By the way, I think the 911 operator did try to help her with her math a little bit.

kjRmm28oaa	I've always known that I was gay. I never tried fighting it and I was never embarrassed! I knew as a young kid that I preferred other boys my age and that's how it's always been! I've never had to try and hide anything, because people have always accepted me for who I am. <br>  <br>  Most people realize that they're gay in their teens or early twenties. I don't recommend that you try to fight it, because it will just make things harder on yourself. Also, you shouldn't be embarrassed! You should be proud of who you are and try to make the best out of it! If you haven't come out yet, I would suggest that you do it slowly so you don't cause a lot of shock or anything! You don't have to come out to everybody all at once, if you don't want to.Just go at a pace that is comfortable to you!<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything! (:|`|ohK4HIetaa	I realized when i was about 14 though looking back probably knew a lot earlier, i wasn't embarrassed but thought life was complicated enough without this and tried to ignore it. I did try fighting it and would have done anything to change it but as you get older it gets harder and harder since when your younger it is easier to have sexuel relationships or pretend you have one with girls since your hornier. thus it is easier to hide. As i got older i realized i had to move away from the small town i lived in which looking back was the best thing i ever done and i'm now glad i am gay since it pushed me to live in a large city where being gay is nothing out of the ordinary and where opportunity to do what you want i life is greater. Now i'm pretty glad i'm gay since if i was nt i'd probably be in that small town in a crap life i'd hate.

4aveC2aaaa	ok, well alcohol is forbidden. <br>  <br>  it is also forbidden for a woman to wear perfume and walk past men.<br>  <br>  keep in mind there are different types of alcohol<br>  <br>  >>>><br>  According to most scholars, alcohol is impure. Allah says in the Qur'an:<br>  <br>  "Alcohol, games of chance, idols and divining arrows are only a filth ('rijs') of Satan's handiwork." (5:90)<br>  <br>  Some scholars say that it is pure, for they take the meaning of the Arabic word 'rijs' in its abstract sense as describing alcohol and whatever is related to it. This is not labelled as impure in a definite, sensory way. Allah says:<br>  <br>  "Stay away from the filth ('rijs') of idols." (22:30)<br>  <br>  Idols are impure in the abstract sense, and they are not considered impure if one touches them. The explanation of the preceding verse is that they are a tool of Satan, for they cause enmity and hatred and keep people away from the remembrance of Allah and prayer.<br>  <br>  In 'Subul as-Salaam' it says, "Their origin is pure, and their being prohibited does not mean that the object itself is impure. For example, hashish is prohibited but it is pure. But, something impure is not necessarily prohibited. Every impure thing is prohibited, but not vice-versa. That is because of the ruling that something impure cannot be touched under any circumstances. If a ruling says that something is impure, it is also prohibited. This differs from a ruling that something is prohibited. For example, it is forbidden to wear silk and gold, but they are absolutely pure by consensus." If one understands that, then the prohibition of alcohol does not necessarily entail its also being considered impure: it needs some other evidence to prove that it is impure. If not, then we are left with the original position that it is pure. If one claims other than that, he must substantiate it." [End of text from Sayyid Sabiq.]<br>  <br>  Subul al-Salam is by al-San`ani who, more than Sayyid Sabiq, is an author of "Salafi" tendencies who does not follow the fiqh of any particular school although the Subul is a commentary on Nukhbat al-fikar fi mustalah ahl al-athar by Ibn Hajar al- `Asqalani, who is Shafi`i.<br>  <br>  San`ani says in Subul al-Salam, chapter on eliminating impurity (1:50): "The prohibition of consuming the flesh of the wild *** and alcoholic beverages (khamr) which is indicated by the texts does not necessitate their being impure. There must be another proof for such a ruling. Otherwise we remain on the basis that is agreed-upon concerning purity (i.e. all things are pure unless explicitly declared otherwise). Whoever claims otherwise, the burden of proof is on him."<br>  <br>  The above opinion is very close to the position of the Zahiri [literalist] school of Dawud al-Zahiri on the issue and, in our century, was also promoted by Muhammad Rashid Rida and his friends of the early Egyptian "Salafi" movement in Tafsir al-Manar (7:58).<br>  <br>  This opinion is shadhdh [deviating/contradicting consensus], as stated by Sa`di Abu Habib in the article "khamr" of his "Mawsu`at al-ijma` fi al-fiqh al-islami" (Encyclopedia of consensus in Islamic Law) 1:381 #5. In fact the literal evidence -- and Allah knows best -- is that khamr is rijs ("filth") where rijs means najas, "impurity." Moreover there is explicit confirmation of its status as impure in the hadith of Abu Tha`laba al-Khushani in Bukhari and Muslim:<br>  <br>  "O Messenger of Allah, we live in the land of the People of the Book: should we eat in their vessels?..." The Prophet replied: "If you find other than their vessels then don't eat in them, but if you don't find, then wash them and eat from them."|`|t6MHAb55aa	please answer mine.it didn't appear::<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlZD6KG1wZEYt6Yqpx8h.tXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304135056AAnT78p">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|gndbaRgaaa	If that is true my prayers are nto excepted for a while now.

akwVAZcEaa	Pride is not evil in itself but because it focuses one's attention on themselves and tends to make them big-headed.<br>  The reason why God detests it is because it takes away the glory that belongs to Him, not ourselves.   <br>  If you've won something, for example, where did your ability to win come from - yourself or God?   Who was it that made the brain, the muscles or provided the skills that caused the win?<br>  <br>  Sloth laziness is expecting others to do the things you're quite able to do for yourself.

God places, and removes kings and queens.<br>  So pride is saying I, the creation did this myself. Not even acknowledging God gave you the talent, ability, opportunity, to succeed, achieve and accomplish.<br>  So worshipping yourself. The sin of pride.<br>  God made Nebuchezzar lowly like the animal of the field, to show He was God, and remind Neb. his true place. Neb started eating on all fours like an animal.|`|wB3AbJyLaa	According to Christina teachers, the essential vice, the utmost evil, is pride. Unchaste, anger, greed, drunken, and all that, are mere fleabites in comparison: It was through pride that the devil became devil: Pride leads to every other vice: It is the complete anti-God state of mind. Does this seem to you exaggerated? If so, think it over. The more pride one had, the more one disliked pride in others. In fact, if you want to find out how proud you are the easiest way is to ask yourself, "How much do I dislike it when other people snub me, or refuse to take any notice of me, or shove their oar in, or patronize me, or show off?" The point is that each person's pride is in competition with everyone's other pride. It is because I wanted to be the big noise. Two of a trade never agree. Now what you want to get clear is that pride is essentially competitive, is competitive by its very nature, while the other vices are competitive only, so to speak, by accident. Pride gets no pleasure out of having something, only out of having more of it than the next man. We say the people are proud of being rich, or clever, or good-looking than others. If everyone else became equally rich, or clever, or good-looking there would be nothing to be proud about. It is the comparison that makes you proud: The pleasure of being above the rest. Once the element of competition has gone, pride has gone. That is why I say that pride is essentially competitive in a way other vices are not. The sexual impulse may drive two men into competition if they both want the same girl. But that is only by accident; they might just as likely have wanted two different girls. But a proud man will take your girl from you, not because he wants her, but to prove to himself that he is the better man than you. Greed may drive men into competition if there is not enough to go around; but the proud man, even when he has got more than he can possibly want, will try to still get more just to assert his power. Nearly all those evils in the world which people put down to greed or selfishness are really far more the result of pride.|`|d7417f76fabaaeaca09baa21844aa149aa	Sloth is not using the spell checker.<br>  If you can hit a key to check it, you are lazy.|`|67e4501c0c56a505b86d4b14fc9a8330aa	Pride is a sin when we think that we are mightier than or equal to God.

Most of the things you mention have nothing to do with whether someone is goth or not, but for the things you mention that do, no, they're not goth.  You mention for music Manson and Slipknot.  Neither of these artists are goth, but rather metal. Real goth music is stuff like Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and The Sisters of Mercy.  Also, as far as clothes, chains are not goth at all and also just because Gothic Lolita has 'gothic' in the name doesn't mean it has to do with the goth subculture.  It's something entirely different.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	I think all "goths" are fake. Just because you feel a certain way or listen to a certain type of music doesn't mean that you have to make yourselves look like vampire wanna-bes. Sorry for the rant...just had to throw that out there.|`|rlEoPwjEaa	If you have to ask and give a detailed explanation of yourself..you are still a baby wannabe goth.<br>  <br>  You say you dont care what ppl think..but you do. If you did not you would not contradict yourself by saying you dont...and then asking if ppl think you are really goth or not.<br>  <br>  and also..you are actually trying too hard with everything you have said about yourself. its like you are trying to take everything " goth" and roll it all into one just to prove a point.<br>  <br>  Right now you are just trying to find your niche in the world.<br>  <br>  There are older goths of course..these are ppl who have been in the goth subculture for years.... Ive been dealing with the Goth subculture off and on for around 15 yrs. But I do not always dress " goth". I do have the subtle tellings that i do have a connection with it...the dark hair...the pale skin that i dont wanna tan...but my clothing is not always dark and brooding..and i definately do not go around with a f*ck the world look on my face..( i did that when i was a teenager). ( thats just looks wise ofcourse. My musical tastes and what I think about the general population...is a bit more posittive than it was when i was younger.<br>  <br>  Maybe when you are older....and you still have an interest in the goth subculture..then maybe you can graduate from being a baby wannabe goth..to an actual one.<br>  <br>  That is..if it still interests you.
HIMwyeZqaa	So, what are you advocating?  Do you want more women to join you in man hating?  No thanks.  That doesn't seem like very much fun.  I would advise you to do whatever is necessary to lose weight.  I have no doubt that as a young woman I'm in the most advantaged demographic group.  That will reverse on me big time when I become older.  Still, both young men and old women can have wonderful relationships.  Fat advocates of hate are not going to do well at any age.  Rejecting people who don't want much to do with you to begin with is no path to glory.  I would suggest a little more honey in your personality and a lot less vinegar.|`|HLqzrBNmaa	I hate fat people.|`|N9WzNLsRaa	Lol, this is actually kind of funny. Now of course you have men that objectify women, but you also have women that use men. A man (or woman) can only do what you let them, <br>  <br>  I have many male friends that I have never and will never have sex with... What is it that they want from me besides friendship? I'm not giving them anything nor have I ever gave them the idea that I wanted more than a friendship... But they stick around. They hold doors open for me, pay my way (Most times) when we go out to movies or dinner... Even if we go as a group. They call and check on me.<br>  <br>  Then there are men I don't even know personally. Whenever I'm out, I can pretty much always count on the guy that's in front of me to hold the door open whether he's young or old. I remember just last week my mother and I went to the movies, we were going through the door and a guy that was INSIDE already saw us through the glass and he went out of his way to open it for us. This man I'm sure was not attracted to my mother or me... But he did something just to be nice. <br>  <br>  I'm brown skinned, I am not stick thin, I don't have blonde hair, and I'm an A cup. If this was your way of bashing men, then you failed miserably. <br>  <br>  Also, I have seen more snobby women let the door close on people who are in wheel chairs or are even pushing baby strollers than I have men.|`|kGYL8a4Yaa	Hi hater..!<br>  <br>  I don't hate women. I mean, there's women I dislike but that's because of personal disagreements between the two of us.<br>  <br>  I don't like "extremely skinny, with huge breasts", I'm attracted to real women.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  Yep, I'm totally the root of all evil just because you said so.<br>  <br>  You clearly aren't open-minded enough to see that not all men are the same and that all men aren't this 'evil' you talk about.<br>  <br>  edit 2:<br>  Why would I hate women anyways? That would mean I hate my own Mother and Sister..|`|wTqid2ONaa	No fat chicks !|`|jcK6EXpiaa	I see what you mean, Don't think its deliberate, I just think men feel that unless a woman looks like a sex bunny, she is unworthy of love (unless its their mom or grandma) look at how many couples divorce because the husband says "she let herself go..." never mind that hubby has a pot belly and gray hair...and I really think its all about the media, it makes women out to only be as good as they look. My husband grew up without much T.V. , same with most of his society, and they tend to be much more respectful and chivalrous toward women regardless of size and age (in fact, its like the older you are, the more respect you get. Grandparents are literally waited on hand and foot by their grand kids)|`|npTZTzWRaa	I believe you are a man hater, if im not mistaken you have asked questions bashing men in the past, of you hate men so much why not be lesbo, I feel sorry for the guy who winds up with you<br>  <br>  you are the type that gives feminism a bad name<br>  <br>  edit-"Men are pretty much the root of all evil"LMFAO, do you realise that there are many men who feel that most women are evil b*tches, how people can hate a whole gender is beyond me<br>  <br>  its official, your insane|`|hZltMpiPaa	well, not every guy hates fat women...i agree it's a culture-bound stereotype but there are always exceptions especially when you go outside america...|`|HPqCRBq8aa	How can a man hate a women without hating himself. If you hate women, then you must hate men, too.|`|CE4hcUmhaa	Whoa!!!<br>  <br>  Guess who didn't get any beads at Mardi Gras!  Do you always feel this way or only every 28 days?|`|SINgsfVNaa	Nope.|`|xQ6P4bVEaa	you must be a fat chick|`|l2qtG4yfaa	The girls OPENLY hate men but toleratre them for sexual and financial purposes. They don't care about nice guys who actually want something other than sex--and then they get in a relationship with a jerk and complain about every single man just because the jerk did something to them. Start looking around with open eyes and you will see what is going on in both sexes. I see what you are saying about SOME men--and I completely agree with what you said about it (Except that men are the root of all evil---you have some valid points but the way you present them turn everyone against you).<br>  SOME men only give attractive or popular female a chance because they are attractive and popular.<br>  SOME women only give attractive or wealthy men a chance because they are attractive or wealthy.<br>  The thing is--it is apart of society on both ends. But you fail to realize the women's role in this.<br>  The thing is what you have mentioned takes place within the same sex too.<br>  <br>  Females only want to be friends with pretty and popular girl, they never want to be friends with a nerdy poor girl. Same with guys, no guy want to be friends with a nerdy guy.<br>  <br>  You have good but very NARROW view of how certain aspects play a role in people's interactions.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you broaden the view---if you heard the statement "nice guys finish last" it comes from girls don't want nice guys they want the bad boys. I hear girls all the time tell people "he is TOO nice" but then they take the bad boy and then he does something 2 months later and they complain about men in general. It is hypocritical on ALL sides--not just men.<br>  <br>  If you want anyone to actually see some of you valid points I suggest that you broaden yoour view, and take out the extremist man hating ideology.

mFSPvoDJaa	The Mayan calendar ends 12/12/2012, which simply means the Mayans had better things to do than to carve the next B'ak'tun (395 years) in stone. <br>  <br>  The asteroid Apophis will miss Earth by less than 21,000 miles on Friday the 13th of April, 2029, which puts it within the orbits of geosynchronous satellites. The odds of hitting a satellite are like one in a quintillion, and the gravitational effect on satellites will be nil. There is a somewhat higher risk (1 chance in 45,000) for the next close approach of Apophis on April 13, 2036. We'll have to reassess the trajectory after 2029 to see what effect Earth's gravity had on Apophis. <br>  <br>  Apophis is about 1/4 kilometer across---nowhere near as big as Earth! If all our calculations and measurements are wrong and it hits the Earth, it will be like a 880 megaton bomb; that's about 4 times more powerful than the Krakatau volcano explosion of 1883.|`|nbiGJOiBaa	No, the Mayan prophecy claims that the world will end on December 22, 2012.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  I hate it when I get a thumbs-down when I didn't say anything incorrect or offensive o.O|`|gsWha0wTaa	Forget the Mayan calendar and look at the date 21st Dec = winter solstice, This is nothing new, people worried about it 4,000 years back.|`|c05702374b5bc85f3a1502d55060a46eaa	No calendar end, just have cycles end, new cycle begin, no one know when any cycle of Mayan calendar end, 2012 is guess,  some say 12/21/12, others say 12/23/12, no firm basis of either date, is just hoax, only ignorant people believe silly hoax.

k3FpInRAaa	You have no idea how much time I have spent researching and trying to figure it all out.  I have two theories.<br>  The fist is that it is all completely made up, just like the last 3 were.  There have been weird theories about the end of the world since the beginning of time, and I think that is fascinates people when they think the world is going to end.<br>  The next theory is really far fetched, but the more you look into it, the more you will be convinced. It all has to do with outer space, ancient history, and even aliens. Yeah, I know how it sounds, but it is SO interesting.  Maybe it's just me, but I am interested in that type of thing.  I can't explain it all now or you would fall asleep reading, but to find out the big story you can watch this great youtube video.  Type in "ancient technology" and look for the long video (about 45 minutes). I kinda freaked myself out watching it, but it was all worth it of course.<br>  Enjoy discovery!|`|1FARQZfIaa	might have another ice age or possably another world war but i doubt anything will happen|`|4e0pOmt7aa	well the Mayan believed that the world would end in 2012|`|r7Vhc9zNaa	Read the Bible>Book of Revelations (Last book)|`|d3e50521e19f17b9f2f8250119424a60aa	The one theory I've heard that sounds the most plausible is that on December 21, 2012 (the day of the winter solstice), there will be a rare astronomical alignment (as depicted in the Mayan calendar) that hasn't happened in at least 31,000 years. When this happens, it will trigger a change in our thought patterns, allowing humanity to become elevated to a higher consciousness. It makes sense, if you think about it; at about this time, our ancestors were nomadic hunter-gatherers, then suddenly they began populating the Nile and building Pyramids.<br>  <br>  Also, 2012 is the year in which the Earth's magnetic field is to shift; meaning magnetic north will become magnetic south. When it shifts, there will be a very small period of time in which the Earth has NO magnetic field. And in that very small time frame, our minds will be cleansed of any and all negative feeling and bring about an age of enlightenment. You can see this happening now; areas of the globe with weaker magnetism tend to be populated with open-minded and free thinking people, while regions with strong magnetism are usually stubborn and conservative.|`|KFyFmi1Iaa	Some believe that the Mayans just stopped with their predictions after 2012 because they didn't expect to survive this long.<br>  <br>  others believe it will bring a new beginning, such as a revolution of some sort.<br>  <br>  and of course there is the one heard so frequently: we're all gunna die then.<br>  <br>  <br>  Personally I go for the first one.

It's jsut teh beginning of a new age- no big deal, swear. <br>  <br>  what has people in a panic is that the mayan's are REFUSING to release their calander as of yet, only 4, 12 month years, away from the big day when it starts over again.

Like a dad warning his child not to play in the street. The dad's not gonna tie the child up, afraid that he might play in the street (this is where free will comes in-- many people are confused about free will and that topic)-- the dad is just gonna plead with the child not to.<br>  That's the same with God. He loves us (we are all His children whether we want to be or not) with ALL of His heart (we can't comprehend that) and He doesn't want us to go to hell, it was made for satan and his fallen angels, but if we leave our sins unforgiven, we have to pay the price. God doesn't want us to go there, He loves us sooo much that He's gonna plead with us to come to Him.<br>  <br>  I know people get annoyed with comparing God with the wind, but it's true. Also read John 20:29. <br>  We should have faith in Him, not need to see Him.|`|UhKxohnxaa	I understand your point it's something that I was wondering before also but it's explained well in the bible.

God does not want to lose anyone but He doesn't FORCE anyone to follow Him, either (2 Peter 3:9).<br>  Atheists are not forced to disbelieve - they choose to do so.   Most people start off in life without any interest in Jesus or God but change as their lives progress.   That's why we should not be too harsh on foolish atheists as we have ALL been sinners and have done wrong at some time or another.<br>  <br>  As far as 'proof' of God goes, the fact that we exist is proof enough.  The fact is we don't need any more proof than that because there is no alternative.   Evolution is easily disproved.|`|KgCUpE5naa	It's simply free will.<br>  <br>  Whether we choose to follow God or not is our own choise. It's not like God's saying, "zOMG, hai guise, guess wat.

If the fate of our eternal soul is important enough for God to scribe his commandments into stone, why aren’t those tablets sitting in our Nation’s Capitol instead of the Constitution.  Why doesn’t God speak to each and every person individually instead of leaving it to chance, fate, or the compassion of another believer?<br>  <br>  There are more Christians and Theist in the world than Atheist, so statistically there should be a lot less sin, right?  With all these “believers” the world should be a much better place than it is.  Perhaps it is because Non-theist, like me, are so analytical that they can’t appreciate the aesthetics of believing in a higher power.  Aside from the forces of nature, mankind has no other enemy but himself.  It is ironic that we should have to call on a higher power to mitigate the misery that we created for ourselves.  If I were God I would be so embarrassed by my creation I could definitely understand if he said, “You made this mess, clean it up your own damn selves.”  :)|`|71afc901962b777c2e8f21c2f42d3fefaa	Wow,that's a very great question!

I to have been there at a time<br>  in my life asking these questions myself.<br>  <br>  I thought at a moment In my life that I had found God. I heard this message about the Gospels of Jesus, how this God came down from <br>  Heaven in the likeness of man. And this Jesus shared with many <br>  that the kingdom of Heaven is coming soon and that in order to be a part of that amazing day was that I needed to change my mind<br>  about who God realy was in my life; to change my mind about the things that were in or within me that I was giving myself to.<br>  I heard and was able to picture, that this same Jesus went to the this<br>  cross made out of wood and was beaten,stabbed,whipped by a weapon used to hit the backs of those who were to be pushied for wrong doing,(had this whip had metal and glass balls at the end so when it landed on his back it wound rip out his flesh enough to see oragns).Anyway. He was beaten for you and me and being sinless.<br>  <br>  But you know after some time walking with Jesus(praying,reading the Bible,fellowship w/others) I relized that this whole tome it was God that found me where I was at in life.

But why would a loving God condemn anyone to hell? Because we have all sinned against Him and have broken His law. "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).<br>  <br>  It is a fact that most people's consciences tell them not to kill, steal, and commit rape. Our laws also show that it is wrong to do these things. No one protests when our police officers throw people into jail because they have committed these horrible crimes. Why? Because you know that evildoers must be punished. Let's talk about another example: What kind of judge would appoint a murder to prison? A mighty good one would!<br>  <br>  If a judge were to set criminals free without the punishment specified in the law, that judge would be unjust and would have to be dismissed from the bench. In the same way, a mighty good and holy God would also condemn a sinner or a person to hell that chooses to remain separated from Him in their sins. If He didn't, He would not be a righteous and just God.<br>  <br>  When you stand before God one day at His judgment seat, on what basis do you think that you will have a right to enter heaven and avoid the torments of hell? God says absolutely none by your own standards! Romans 3:10 says; "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one". <br>   <br>  Sin separates mankind from God. What is sin anyway? Take a look at God's standard of righteousness and test yourself to see if you have broken any of His laws.<br>  <br>  1). Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Have you always obeyed God's word and put it ahead of your own wants? Do you even know what it says? Have you always put God first in every area of your life? Have you always loved Him with all of your heart, mind, soul and strength? If you answer no to any of these, you have broken God's 1st commandment. <br>  <br>  2). Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image. Have you ever put a material thing like money, a car, or a career ahead of God? Did you ever have your own beliefs about God rather than the ones that are revealed in the Bible? If so, you are an idolater - you have broken God's 2nd commandment. <br>  <br>  3). Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain. Have you ever used God's name as a swear word? If so, you are profane - you have broken God's 3rd commandment <br>  <br>  4). Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Have you always kept the sabbath holy? If not, you are a sabbath-breaker - you have broken God's 4th commandment. <br>  <br>  5). Honour thy father and thy mother. Have you ever disobeyed or spoken evil of your parents? Have you ever been rebellious against them in any way, even as a child or a teenager? If so, you are rebellious and disobedient - you have broken God's 5th Commandment. <br>  <br>  6). Thou shalt not kill. The Bible says that if we hate someone, we commit murder in our hearts. Have you ever hated someone or had evil thoughts toward another person? If so, you are a murderer at heart - you have broken God's 6th commandment. (Matthew 5:21-22) <br>  <br>  7). Thou shalt not commit adultery. Have you always been faithful to your spouse? Have you ever had sex with anyone before you were married (fornication)? Have you ever engaged in sexual fantasies or lustful thoughts about anyone not your spouse? If so, you are an adulterer - you have broken God's 7th commandment. (Matthew 5:27-28) <br>  <br>   8). Thou shalt not steal. Have you ever taken anything that didn't belong to you, no matter how small in value? If so, you are a thief - you have broken God's 8th commandment. <br>  <br>  9). Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. Have you ever told a lie, a fib, white lie, or half truth about someone else? Have you ever spoken anything about anyone knowing that it was not completely and totally true? If so, you are a liar - you have broken God's 9th commandment. <br>  <br>  10). Thou shalt not covet. Have you ever desired to have something that someone else has - a girl or guy, a car, a house, a job, or anything else? If so, you are covetous - you have broken God's 10th commandment. <br>  <br>  Everyone that has ever lived (except the Lord Jesus Christ) has broken at least one of these commandments. Most of us have probably broken most of them. <br>  <br>  HEAR THE WORDS OF GOD!<br>  <br>  "... no murderer hath eternal life..." (1 John 3:15)<br>  <br>  "Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God." 1 Corinthians 6:9-10<br>  <br>  "but the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone..." (Revelation 21:8)<br>  <br>  When you - a murderer, a thief, an adulterer, a liar - stand before the righteous Judge of all the universe, how could He not require that justice be satisfied by exacting the due penalty for your sins in the fires of hell?<br>  <br>  Even though God's own creation had disobeyed Him, He still loved us so much that He gave the ultimate sacrifice so we could be forgiven of our sins."But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8).<br>  <br>  The debt of sin has been paid in full by Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God! When you believe in Jesus Christ and invite Him into your life, He washes away every sin you have ever committed.<br>  <br>  God is holy and cannot allow anyone with sin into heaven. That is why we need the righteousness of Christ to cover us. This must be done by believing in Jesus Christ and by accepting Him as your Savior and submitting to Him as the Lord of your life. Making Jesus your Savior means that you believe that Jesus died so you could be forgiven. Making Jesus your Lord means that you put Him first in your life. Your submitting to His authority allows Him to begin making necessary changes in your life.|`|OUBuIKDMaa	Oh for crying out loud, another one of these....<br>  <br>  <br>  If God really loved us X would/wouldn't happen<br>  <br>  If God really existed He would be able to do X <br>  <br>  and so on and so on....<br>  <br>  If God were able to do X he would do it but since He hasn't He doesn't exist. <br>  <br>  Free will is not the cop out people like you try to make it out to be; without free will we would not have the love to freely love each other or God.<br>  <br>  It's not God's fault that peolpe go to Hell any more than it's a judge's fault guilty people go to jail; choices have consequences so if you don't like the consequneces of your decisions make different ones.|`|0vDC99t0aa	there is enough proof look around you its everywhere.  every thing in this universe came from god. it did not make it self  and it is our fault because he gives us all changes to change some just dont want to take it. and atheists just need to realize proof is every where  and if you want the real truth read the king james bible .<br>  i mean how much more proof do you need. i mean he made every thing on this earth and every thing around it. thats all the proof you really did.|`|SzYUiy30aa	God wants us to go to heaven. he gives us a choice to love him or reject him.

RR|`|jdRKZe18aa	A poster named "Gravity Under Stars" asked this same question earlier today, just slightly different wording.  Not to be redundant...but I answered:<br>  <br>  Well personally I think most people have a faulty view about God, hell, judgment and things of an eternal nature all the way around.<br>  <br>  To stick with your "Loving Father" line of thinking - lets say your earthly father loves you<no doubt> and that He loved you perfectly, was a great father, taught you everything you needed to know about being a good, kind, decent person and then you grew up and decided you were going to commit some awful crime and were sent to prison for it. Is your FATHER than to blame for YOUR choices? Should your father somehow prevent you from facing the CONSEQUENCES of your choices just because he is your father and loves you? <br>  <br>  Of course he wants what is best for you. He wants you to be happy. He wants you to grow and learn and become responsible, accountable, successful and ALL that HE KNOWS you can be, right? WELL, that is the loving HEAVENLY FATHER <and parent> that I know also - HE doesn't SEND ANYONE or THREATEN anyone with HELL - HE OFFERS US "all He has" and we either CHOOSE HIM and live eternally with Him - or we choose the other path that leads to eternal unhappiness and misery. WE CHOOSE - He doesn't choose it for us. HE EVEN provided a way OUT in the event we did choose wrongfully - and HIS perfect SON provides that escape from our own bad choices if we but REPENT - then the way back is clear and we are again saved by His great mercy, grace & love..... BUT again... that is our choosing. Do we reach for that life line and LIVE or not??? It's all about choice & accountability..... as it is with ALL GOOD LOVING parents.|`|WxxA2B7Naa	good question.|`|0yTM98Odaa	This is one of the many reasons why Christianity doesn't make sense.

Why get annoyed when people question your completely illogical beliefs!<br>  <br>  No chance without Jesus- If say I had a child and they wanted to play with matches and petrol, I would not let them!

He gave us rules to follow to have a perfect life on earth. With obedience comes reward and with disobedience comes punishment. He gave us the rules and told us the consequences. Gave us free choose. And it's our decision on what to do with it all.<br>  <br>  Atheists have choose as well. And they choose to deny Him. Not just not belief that He exists but actually deny Him. Hell is open for them. Atheists ahve heard about God, many read the BIble and then argue with believers about it. They still deny it all. Some convert and some Christians change to atheism as well. Once you hear God's word, you use your free will to listen and obey or deny. For people, like an African village, that has never heard of God  or Jesus or Heaven, they will be judged according to their actions and words to other people. They can't be judged on their faith because they were never given a chance to learn about Him.<br>  <br>  God doesn't have to prove Himself. He created it from the beginning and showed Himself to the first people and a few others, incarnated Himself and came to earth. That's His proof. That rest is up to you as to whether you have faith or not.<br>  <br>  Atheists aren't using logical with this. They are closing their minds to the possibility of God existing. They can't even fathom for a moment that there could be a slight chance of a deity in existence. They are freely choosing to deny Him.

For example knowing when to keep letters silent and how to spell certain words will often appear very random from a learning perspective.|`|ab12bf1cc4fcd2264e88fe8e2ee186f2aa	No, if there's only pure English words [no foreign vocabulary, just English words]. <br>  Yes, if there's an influx of too many foreign vocabulary words.<br>  <br>  Also, after so many years of laying down the grammars, and pronunciation, sometimes it could even be wrong, or has an alternative spelling or pronunciation, which makes it seem like "English is so complicated." It's that way because there were no standard spelling rules in English for many years. And there were too many foreign people ruling over the area we now call England or Great Britain.<br>  <br>  English is NOT half Germanic, and half Romance! English were from Anglo-Saxons, whose language resembles Germanic languages. French used to be called Frankish, which is similar to German, but because of Roman Catholics, Latin became the ruling language in churches, so French gradually became a Latinate language. There's nothing romantic about being conquered, by a dead language now. French should retain their Frankish roots and vocabulary! Romance is not a language! That's because the Roman Catholic church forced the religion on the people.|`|Lpc2aAzRaa	any language is hard to learn, but english in particular is easier (not so easy, just easier) in comparison to other languages such as hindi,german, and arabic.<br>  <br>  those other languages are waaay harder, with complicated gramar and such.|`|LddkW0JFaa	I'm a native speaker so my answer is almost worthless.

Did you know it was written by a man who used to captain slave ships, who saw the abject misery of others and was converted to Christianity?  There's even a movie called Amazing Grace, this man is a side story to the movie.<br>  <br>  It's a lovely hymn, and reminds me what mercy God had on me.|`|IFQFt25naa	Actually the song took on a whole new level of meaning(s) once I read this little piece of history.<br>  <br>  In His younger days, John Newton signed on with a slave ship leaving from Africa with its "cargo." He was an experienced sailor and navigator, but his cursing and blaspheming turned hardened sailors' ears red. Soon the ship was caught in a horrible storm and was taking in water. The crew had to pump 24 hours a day to stay afloat. But the constant wind rocked the boat so dangerously that the sailors had to tie themselves to the deck to keep from being swept overboard. At one point, several of the crew tried to throw Newton overboard. They figured that God was punishing him like Jonah of the Old Testament. The captain declared that the only way the ship would make it in to safe harbor was by God's power. He commanded everyone-including Newton-to pray.<br>  <br>  "God, if You're true," Newton prayed earnestly, "make good your Word. Cleanse my vile heart."<br>  <br>  After four weeks of storms and constant brushes with death, the ship limped into an Irish port. John Newton, former "free thinker," former slave trader and atheist, declared his faith in Jesus. He became a relatively well-known preacher and writer.  <br>  <br>  However, we chiefly remember him as the author of the hymn "Amazing Grace”.<br>  <br>  If one really reads the words, the hymn takes on a whole new meaning when one considers that Newton was writing about his own life and the transformation he experienced.<br>  <br>  May Our Creator watch over you and your family.<br>  <br>  - - - <br>  <br>  Oh for those that do not know the words to the hymn, here is a link:<br>  <a href="http://www.constitution.org/col/amazing_grace.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.constitution.org/col/amazing_...</a>|`|d0945a07b59dce3ca7393bc610216aa9aa	It makes bagpipes tolerable.|`|kNCCrjOeaa	o my god i cant stand that song!<br>  that song is my signal to leave the room or turn off the radio. blah|`|7dN1ANT4aa	I feel pretty black whenever I hear it.|`|ni4YME93aa	When I hear it I feel that this is the song everyone that thinks they can sing, tries to sing.

AA12006309	First, I don't think this is a legitimate question.  No one refers to a person as "it".  That's dehumanizing and wrong, not to mention could jeopardize their jobs or their teaching licenses.<br>  <br>  Unless you're intersexed, you should have an idea of your biological gender.  You're not a Barbie (or Ken) doll.  If you're intersexed, your parents should have explained something to you about your condition.<br>  <br>  As far as your gender identity, only you can answer that question.  You're the only one who knows if you're male, female, third gender, androgyne, two spirit, genderqueer, etc.<br>  <br>  I'll place the link below to T-Vox, the Transgender Wiki site.

4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	I'm having some trouble understanding exactly what you're asking, but here's the best reply I have...<br>  <br>  No matter what someone's anatomical sex is, if they identify as male and are attracted to males, they're gay; if they're attracted to women, they're straight. And if they identify as women and are attracted to men, they are straight; if they're attracted to women, they're lesbian. If either one is attracted to both, then they are bisexual. If they don't care and accept people as people, then they'd be pansexual. :P<br>  <br>  Saying that someone isn't "really a man" because they were born with a vagina is pure ignorance and malice. Same for women who happened to be born with a penis. Judging their sexual orientation off that ("You're not really gay", "You're not really straight", etc) is also ignorant. How someone chooses to identify is NOT your problem. don't like it? Then ignore it and keep on walking. It's only the stupid, mean little people who decide to try and tear someone down because they think they know someone's gender and sexuality better than their victim.|`|3OZgcntfaa	How do you apply trans or intersex conditions to sexuality?<br>  <br>  I don't think you really do. They are two different things entirely.<br>  <br>  You can be any sort of sexual orientation and any sort of gender. They aren't reliant on each other. The only trick would be sorting out what you label them.|`|hQSQx83Taa	It's possible, some people are genuinely only attracted to a very specific type of person. (Such as someone who is biologically female and also identifies as female.) <br>  <br>  However, I am not one of those people, which is why I choose not to apply such labels to myself. They're too restricting. I'm just attracted to... whoever I'm attracted to.<br>  <br>  Edit: to go into further detail, let's say you're a guy who identifies as straight. And you fall in love with a girl who, biologically, has a y chromosome. Does that make you gay? Only if you think it does. If it changes your own identity, that's what's legitimate. If it doesn't, and you see yourself as being in a straight relationship (which is how I would see it, for the record), that's legitimate too. If it's confusing to other people, well, that's life, people are complicated by nature. It's unreasonable to expect us to all fit neatly into little marked boxes.
lvF5Tpniaa	I know that you understand what you thought you heard me say, but I'm sure that you realize that what you heard is not what I meant.|`|Mok3ewI2aa	They should be called stoopid.|`|92a39160b5f170df4b5ef1729f3b2395aa	I have always seen my sexuality as fluid. I am not usually attacted to someone just from seeing them, so when I am single I see myself as asexual, because I am not sexually active, nor turned-on by looks alone. When I had a girlfriend I considered myself lesbian, and asexual again when i was single after her. Then when I was with a guy I considered myself straight. And now, asexual again, but with lesbian proclivities, because I do have a preference, but it may just be because it has been so long. I have always been monogomous when I am dating someone, that's what I expect from my partners, so, respectfully, I am the same.|`|B667elmWaa	Labelling is a waste of time.|`|EZyHOht7aa	No, they don't exist. Most of them are just lying to themselves.|`|4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	No, ex-gays do not exist. If they are ex-gay, then they are either bisexual and choose to be with the opposite sex, are lying to themselves or were never really gay to begin with.<br>  <br>  As for your other questions...<br>  <br>  It is in my opinion that most people are a little bit bisexual anyhow, they just aren't bisexual enough to actually "go for it" or choose to ignore it. :P<br>  <br>  Monogamy isn't the be-all and end-all, either. In fact, the idea of monogamy and having only one relationship Forever and Ever as the majority is fairly recent. Most cultures were polygamous until Christianity and the like became popular. But bisexuality can indeed exist in a monogamous relationship.<br>  <br>  If someone "was gay" and are now "ex-gay", they really should just own up to being bisexual, in the end. It's no big deal... people just make it such.|`|6mXvwy7Jaa	I believe that they do exist. They are ex-GAYS, not un-homosexuals. <br>  <br>  They very rarely can say that they do not ever have homosexual feelings, just that they have "learned to control them" and have "chosen a different path".<br>  <br>  "GAY" is seen as a lifestyle choice. there are many people who are emotionally or physically attracted to the same sex but do not consider themselves GAY because they do not act like or want to be in any way connected to Jack from Will & Grace.<br>  <br>  Popular portrayal seems to say that gay is a state of mind, but if so, same sex attraction(sexual or emotional) is a state of body and heart.<br>  <br>  SO I say that Ex-gayness is the giving up of a former state of mind, not a insistence on having had a current and/or complete emotional and sexual transformation.<br>  <br>  I think you are making things too difficult.|`|hikJhinRaa	The only one I know is Ted Haggard . LOL <br>  no , they are  just in denial|`|hQSQx83Taa	This question is a good example of why I find labels to be mostly useless.<br>  <br>  I am capable of being romantically and physically attracted to people regardless of their biological sex or gender. That's not going to change, it's the same whether I'm single, or in an open relationship, or in a long-term monogamous relationship. <br>  <br>  Theoretically I could decide to only date men from now on, but in my mind that wouldn't make me genuinely heterosexual. It would just mean that I've decided to only date men. It's no different from a straight man deciding to swear off women and just stay single. <br>  <br>  I suppose it's possible for someone to stop being attracted to a certain type of person... theoretically. If you're a guy, and you used to get turned on by other men, but you don't anymore, then I suppose you would be "no longer gay". Although truthfully, I can't really imagine that happening unless you were only attracted to the idea of being gay in the first place. There have been certain subcultures that glamorized it, so I suppose that's possible. <br>  <br>  As for what people should call themselves, that's up to them. However you see yourself, however you identify, that's what you are. No one in the world knows what's going on inside your own head, other than you.
rTscI3Lwaa	turst me when i sasy this i met and know a couple of people like this. he is shy and has terible social skills he aint never going to ask you out but he does like you. the only thing is your goig to have to take charge and talk to him engage him get his number text and go on a date.<br>  <br>  you may find that even when you do talk to him it may be a struggle to get anything out of him but after a few days of getting to know each other he will open up alot more.|`|KurbTbCHaa	try and spend some alone time with him and start a conversation. If he likes you than he'll clearly open up without others around.|`|T8EbdV9laa	he likes you and is to shy to say it.|`|pB55nws3aa	He could just be being nice, but I doubt it. It seems like he's shy and doesn't know what to say to you. Maybe just talk to him and see if he wants to hang out on the weekend...like go to the mall, bowling, walk in the park, etc. Get to know him more, and eventually he'll say that he really likes you. Or just take the easy way and ask him if he likes you, lol.
D6FBLQfwaa	To be honest, everyone finds different things attractive. Is he gay? Maybe. Is he Bi? Maybe. Is he straight? Doubtful, but possible. Some perfectly straight men are turned on by little boys (pedaphila). Some perfectly straight women get turned on by girl-on-girl. Nothing is exact in sexual orientaion.|`|36f164873fb212f4be988fa1d87ec37caa	He might be gay or bi... but in anycase he's 40 and it's his business....|`|ocy7FEcaaa	I think your friend is probably Bisexual.

lK4AZ1FYaa	Well, i myself did not choose to be gay, however i am proud of who i am.<br>  my dad recently came out to my family about being gay himself so it has actually made me wonder if i had received something from him.<br>  but im not entirely sure due to the fact that my brother is straight.<br>  but dont you think it would be interesting if they could figure out if i did get a type of trait from my dad?|`|bVQO0BsPaa	I don't think anyone will ever know for certain.<br>  Do we need to know?

I could have been gay, but I decided I wanted to be straight. I mean I really had the chance to screw someone and i tried it and I said no thanks, and I thought I was gay, but I gthought, I'll ignore the feeling and be straight and I am straight as they come.|`|36f164873fb212f4be988fa1d87ec37caa	Born.<br>  <br>  Next!|`|TYQOafA8aa	Learned behavior|`|4Vswcoqeaa	Suppose you have a shoe fetish (quite common among paraphilias).  You've had it for as far back as you can remember.  Now, how could this be in-born?  Shoes are man-made, they didn't always exist.  Of course this can be applied to the myriad sexual abberrations out there. <br>  <br>  Suppose Homosexuality is genetically determined.  Do you think it would be a favorable trait as far as species survival goes?  Absolutely not, it would be like being born without reproductive parts, since essentially, homosexuals are not known for getting women pregnant, if you catch my drift.|`|oYiAX12Xaa	As far as I'm concerned there's not anything to prove whether it's established through experience or whether you're born with it. My personal belief is that someone doesn't necessarily choose to be gay. Not that being gay is bad, but obviously there are many people that are critical of it.|`|BHpqxFaVaa	i think your born with it<br>  but you don't REALLY KNOW you have it till you hit puberty well at lest that's what happened to me. When i was 11 or 12 i starting thinking about stuff like that and it wouldn't go away. i would cry my self to sleep at night about it, so who would chose that, there goes some people's dumb *** thearey. And then when people are ok with that they think thats when here choseing it? wtf they just getting over the **** people put on them.

DHzwr1braa	When you find the answer let me know, cause I want to know. it seems as if they want the bad girl, the one that will do any and everything at least the ones that I come in contact with.

We are really simple. Women are the ones who expect us to read their minds and understand their emotions, even when they don't themselves. Also, many women flock to thugs and jerks when plenty of decent guys are pursuing them at the same time. For the men who do date women like you described, they're weak.|`|YoHroOcGaa	You pretty one|`|gG9KjYRfaa	When a female treats them great, they start to feel intimidated because they want their women to worship them at their feet.|`|mqQUqXxNaa	lol "flock towards the bitches".|`|ncdTxID9aa	Oh many supposed good women don't appreciate good men.  You know what it is, it's people letting their superficial and shallow desires play them.  Come on not most women or men accept a good person who they aren't that attracted to.  Or not most men or women can deal with a complicated person who is very attractive.  People try to accept one thing over the other, or not give the person behind the looks the chance to reveal who they are.|`|jcK6EXpiaa	I actually read that men are very simplistic in thought, even the intelligent ones. Like, they compartmentalise stuff. For example, when a man is brushing his teeth, watching a movie, getting dressed, etc.. their only thoughts are on what they are doing at that particular moment. Women are almost always having multiple thoughts at a time (a skill that is usually female is the ability to easily say something while thinking something totally different at the same moment) so, in a way, we are the most complicated of the genders. I also read that when it comes to sexuality, men are yet again, more simple. They literally fantasise about BODY PARTS while masterbating or whatever. Women think about individuals and situations. Men also become aroused by sexually explicit visuals, while women tend to become aroused by touch, caress, and setting. Men tend to be attracted to women based on image alone, while 70% of womens attraction to men is based on body language, tone of voice and subconcious smell. The way this affects relationships, is that men crave multiple partners moreso then women, and usually cheat because of sexual reasons, and usually have little to no romantic feelings for the women they cheat with, or they confuse lust for love (and realise it too late). Women usually cheat for emotional reasons, and usually have strong feelings for the person they are cheating with. Older men do this too. how many old men have you been hit on in your life? Seriously, in america its like a woman has to either accept that her husband is going to cheat on her with a much younger mistress, or get a divorce so he can run off and pretend he's still in his 20's (my dad is trying this out, so far he has had little success..eye roll) if a man does neither, he is a rare commodity in this country.|`|hQWucH5uaa	Actually that is not complicated behaviour but very simple behaviour: men think with their glands!|`|Onzxe6ysaa	If not SO MANY of you were b*tches we probably wouldn't have this problem.
0bYcYz2jaa	They CAN, if the problem is due to your being top heavy.  Personally, I have a larger frame and can carry the extra weight on top.  Research the procedure thoroughly, think about how it will change not only your physical appearance, but also how you think of yourself.  For most women, our breasts have a great deal to do with our vision of our femininity and any changes will affect you emotionally.  If you and your doctor decide that this will improve your quality of life, then go for it.  If there are other factors involved in your back problems, you should look into alternative therapies.  Sometimes, losing just a little weight will make such a difference that surgery becomes obsolete.  Be sure you look at all of your options before you resort to surgical intervention.|`|HimBbU6caa	I have no idea, but as long as they aren't hanging down to the knees I say leave them as is, if your back doesn't hurt. That's just me thinking like the lustful man that I am though. Seriously, some people have back problems and blame it on everything from large breasts to bad feet. Sometimes a regular workout regiment can cure chronic back pain, if that back pain is just do to inactivity.|`|1K9EzByaaa	Note: I have not had a breast reduction.<br>  <br>  They do. My aunt was considerably top heavy, and at times, took off of work because of back and side pain. She even wore two bras to help the problem. The surgery was a great decision for her.

lkNJNnlSaa	That is a hell of a lot, so yes|`|D1c8cRM4aa	thats a bit much|`|YvvnTrxDaa	You know very well that isn't healthy|`|Ov5nCTUxaa	yes you have a problem.<br>  <br>      * Men should drink no more than 21 units of alcohol per week (and no more than four units in any one day).<br>      * Women should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol per week (and no more than three units in any one day).<br>      * Pregnant women. It is known that a lot of alcohol can damage a developing baby. A small amount probably does no harm. However, the exact amount that is safe is not known. Therefore, to play safe, advice from the Department of Health is that pregnant women and women trying to become pregnant should not drink at all. If you do chose to drink when you are pregnant then limit it to one or two units, once or twice a week. And never get drunk.<br>  <br>  The more you drink above these limits, the greater the risk of developing serious problems such as: liver disease (cirrhosis or hepatitis); stomach and pancreas disorders; depression; anxiety; sexual difficulties; muscle and heart muscle disease; high blood pressure; damage to nervous tissue; serious accidents; some cancers; obesity (alcohol has many calories). See separate leaflet called 'Alcohol and Sensible Drinking' for more details.<br>  What is a unit of alcohol?<br>  <br>  One unit of alcohol is 10ml (1cl) by volume, or 8g by weight, of pure alcohol. For example:<br>  <br>      * One unit of alcohol is about equal to:<br>            o half a pint of ordinary strength beer, lager or cider (3-4% alcohol by volume), or<br>            o a small pub measure (25ml) of spirits (40% alcohol by volume), or<br>            o a standard pub measure (50ml) of fortified wine such as sherry or port (20% alcohol by volume).<br>      * There are one and a half units of alcohol in:<br>            o a small glass (125ml) of ordinary strength wine (12% alcohol by volume), or<br>            o a standard pub measure (35ml) of spirits (40% alcohol by volume).|`|9lT4e8Efaa	thats a bit excessive... why do you drink that amount? because you feel you cannot go without it? in which case seek help, is it a stress reliever or to help you sleep?

eggQk1d7aa	Nostradamus has predicted every single event that people have wanted him to predict. Sometimes, the same prophecy even applies to events over and over again! Amazing, wasn't he?

But that didn't stop a Nostradamus Web site from being the most popular site search engines like Yahoo and Google, and it didn't stop people from buying tons of books and videos about the celebrated mystic. Nostradamus predicted the end of the world would occur in 3797. For those worried about nuclear war, he wrote: "In year 1991 and seven months, there will come from heaven the great king of terror, to raise again the great king of Mongols, before and after Mars shall reign at will." Interestingly, Hitler became fascinated with Nostradamus after Frau Goebbels, wife of Nazi propaganda minister, introduced him to the "Centuries" in 1939. During World War II, pamphlets based on a forged Nostradamus prophecy that Germany would win the war were dropped from Nazi aircraft. Nostradamus said all his visions came from God even though he admitted that the Bible condemned his methods, which included employing the occult. Now listen closely, James Randi, a secular skeptic and noted debunked, wrote a 1990 book on the subject called "The Mask of Nostradamus: A Biography of the World's Most Famous Prophet." His conclusion? More of the same old "classical psychic claptrap"!|`|YhjFiVGyaa	no. its impossible to translate his radings into anything because they were all done in poetic code so if in his day anybody important read them, he wouldnt be executed for trying to be a false prophet.<br>  <br>  really his quatraines can mean anything and everything, but its easier to try to relate them to actual events AFTER they happened because like I said, they can relate to anything.<br>  <br>  As far as the 2012 thing that the Mayans spoke about...the Mayan calendar was 36 years ahead of our own, the Gregorian.<br>  <br>  If anything was scheduled to happen, it would have happened already.<br>  <br>  also, Nostradamus' predictions actually dont end until way after ther year 3000. <br>  <br>  whatever happens to the world will happen. the native indians say something will occur one day, but it wont wipe us out. we are part of the earth and u just have to go with it.<br>  accept the canges even if it means living off the fruits of the land once again.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Yes I do, for some things will come to pass in the year 2012 concerning London were the 2012 Olympics will be taking place.

Just because you're okay with it doesn't mean you encourage small children to participate in it. I don't believe that gay people were once told "Hey, be gay, it's alright" and so off they went. I believe you're either gay or you're not, you don't randomly become gay because then you're not gay, you're just "make believe gay" which basically means you're a poseur. Congratulations.<br>  <br>  "Normal" depends on a variety things and is really more of a personal opinion once you get down to things like this. Are Catholics normal? What about Baptists? Are hunting enthusiasts normal? What about history buffs? Really, it's a style of life that is normal for that individual. What you consider to be "abnormal" is someone else's "perfectly normal". Homosexuality occurs within the animal kingdom on it's own and isn't really much of a news flash anymore. It occurs in nature without any sort of outside stimulus. American society considers monogamy to be the norm, but not all animals practice monogamy. Some are extremely promiscuous. Some animals also eat their young for a variety of reasons. A lot goes on in the "natural world".<br>  <br>  I usually try to stay away from religious arguments because hey, to each his own, but in this case I'll bite. I don't think I'd point to the Bible as the source for how the natural world behaves. It doesn't lend much credibility unless you're a believer. The Bible is not a work on biology or the natural order of things. It's a religious book, not a scientific text. If you believe in it, that's perfectly fine and I don't really want to get into a bashing session about a book that's supposed to help people lead decent lives and be happy, but I don't feel that it gives much warrant with an individual's feelings on random topics. You ask if I feel homosexuality is okay and I say yes, only to have the Bible thrown back in my face. It doesn't make a lot of sense to someone as heathenous as myself to do something like that if you're just curious and wanting an opinion without having others get upset with you. <br>  <br>  Please note that I am not upset and I don't intend for this to come off that way at all, but it just seems a little...

Then that's okay.|`|IJMyRWp4aa	yes,but you dont tell a 7 year old boy to kiss girls so i would tell him to kiss a boy but i would teach him about accepting others for who they are and not being afraid to  be who he wants to be no matter who that person is.|`|pB55nws3aa	It's not a personal choice, you ignorant idiot. Pick up a book and catch up with everyone else, because it's 2009, but you're stuck in the 1800s.|`|uXWbOhDcaa	You should not tell a 7 year old to kiss anyone.....that is perverted<br>  Child abuse takes many forms, you scare me.|`|12w7YjRTaa	yes!|`|iPudBITBaa	yes its normal... but from ur question u are been to biase... to tell a seven yr old to kiss another little boy?|`|isRDHbJgaa	Yes, it's as natural as me being heterosexual!! <br>  <br>  Don't be a homophob!! There have been homosexuals since the beginning of men, get over it, they will stay here FOREVER!! And there is nothing you can do about it. Don't be ignorant!<br>  And you can't tell a 7 y/o to become gay, people are born gay, get it right<br>  <br>  -----------------------------------<br>  Fine, follow your own advice, everyone is different, don't get mad at them!!<br>  ...............................<br>  There is your problem, you believe in Adam and Eve and the bible and god, that crap is too hateful for me, plus I'd like to think I have BASIC common sense, which allows me the benefit of seeing BS when I read it!|`|jYwSKzg1aa	Yes to your first question.  But I can't answer all the rest of that with one simple yes or no.<br>  <br>  No, it is not a personal choice.<br>  <br>  No, I wouldn't tell my 7 year old boy to kiss anyone.  That's too young for him to be thinking of kissing boys or girls.<br>  <br>  Yes, when he's older I would let him know that when two ADULTS fall in love they can get married and live together.  No need to say man and woman.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Ah, I get it!  Not a parent yet.  Here's a tip for the future -- there's not a child alive who will let you get away with giving one answer for three different questions.  At the very least those of us who have kids know there is not one simple answer to your question.  Well, except the only answer you're willing to accept, which is "no".  If you want that answer, try posting somewhere OTHER than LGBT.<br>  <br>  For someone who's "just curious and stating an opinion", you're awfully inflammatory.  It makes you look like a troll.

One must have done something pretty extraordinary to be created a Duke. Unlike a Knighthood, the title of Duke is hereditary. Examples of Dukes include Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.|`|Iqp3ZUAlaa	No. Knighthoods are entirely different honours than PEERAGE titles,which are mostly inherited these days.<br>  Knighthoods means that a UK citizen can use the title Sir or Dame. A duke is a Lord.<br>  The following peerage titles enables a person to put in their names for election by a commitee of peers into The House of Lords in Parliament:Duke,Marquess,Earl,<br>  Viscount,Baron.<br>  A knighthood is just an honour and it is a lifetime honour that is not passed down in the family,while peerage titles are.<br>  Some sites for you:<br>  <a href="http://www.users.chinet.com/~laura/html/titles01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.users.chinet.com/~laura/html/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.honours.gov.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.honours.gov.uk/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Honours/Honours.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Honour...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.lordsappointments.gov.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.lordsappointments.gov.uk</a>|`|GlaV6f0Raa	No, they just get ( Sir ) in front of there name.

AA11189849	You're very literate for a 14 y.o.  Your spelling is exceptional compared to those adults on this site who sometimes cannot express themselves effectively.  So, I am going to guess that you are one of the "smart people" right?  <br>  Okay.  Do not say anything to this person. It will never end.  Just laugh and smirk and walk away like "What a joke this moron is..."  trust me.  It has been done TO ME and I felt all stupid when they did it.  Seriously. <br>  Just laugh to yourself. Make it look real and walk away like it is funny and you are laughing at THEM.  <br>  Eventually, it will get old.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Wait, this is a guy friend?  He is no friend.  Make sure to treat him as your worst enemy. Do not make eye contact, he is now invisible to you.   <br>  I'd TOTALLY avoid him.  I'd pretend he didn't exist and acknowledge EVERYONE around him BUT him.  When he tries to talk to you (and he will) cut him off by interupting and saying, "No, no, you hate me..." and walk away...|`|0F8hauikaa	That's a relief because if you liked me, how would I ever get rid of you?<br>  <br>  Don't be hateful like the jerk that is mean to you, just be smarter (unless you really want to be like him, which I doubt).

NOBODY!  So hate me all you want!'  But don't say it in a mean tone and don't be condescending, just be matter-of-a-fact in tone, like its the last of your concerns.  Maybe don't even make eye contact, just look slightly past him like he's an afterthought.  If he's the ringleader in the group of 'nobody likes you' it'll get old to everyone else after awhile.  But the best thing to do is just be above them in mentality and maturity and don't let them see that its bothering you.  Because kiddo, kids are cruel and if they see that its tormenting you, they'll likely keep doing it just to get a response.  And if that doesn't work, ask him why he's acting like a teenage girl and if he's PMSing!  Or you could ask him if his girlish behavior is a result of him questioning his sexuality.  Okay, that is the less mature route to take...|`|0uWoKa6Faa	just say "ok" to whatever comes your way. it worked for me when i was a few years younger. i'd get everyone frustrated. but it didn't last for long. <br>  <br>  it was a guy saying that to you? why are you worried about every little thing everyone has to say, anyways. <br>  <br>  Insult: "if you were my wife, i'd give you poison" <br>  Comeback: "if you were my husband, i'd drink it"<br>  <br>  lols|`|7Np368AUaa	Say things to make him annoyed and make him think it doesnt bother u<br>  "I hate you too!"<br>  "Awesome!"<br>  "im so hatable arent i"<br>  "i hate myself too"<br>  "ur pretty"<br>  <br>   hope this helps???|`|QdadVLe8aa	if you are with a friend whisper in her/his ear --both of you look at him and burst out laughing...arrange this with your friend first|`|ZXdAimqXaa	I'm a fan of, "Suck a fart out of my *** through a straw."|`|Y4dr9Wfmaa	your mum has AI... oh 14 erm|`|pLJ6JXxDaa	Your mom goes to college!<br>  That one always works.

I think you should stop looking at people by what color their skin is, but who they are as an individual, and not how everyone else is in their racial group.<br>  <br>  Edit: I did read the whole paragraph.

I had a long relationship with a popular black guy from my neighborhood and met alot of girls like you. but thething is if i see a mixed couple, i think its beautiful. there are plenty of bad white men too!!! IT does not bother me in the least way to see a good successful, handsome white man with a woman of any other race, more power to them. I believe if someone is good to you and makes you happy and vice versa, THATS ALL THAT MATTERS, and if her dating pool is so shallow maybe she should get out of the pool and go for a swim in the ocean!|`|hQSQx83Taa	I don't think that in itself makes you racist; he should be less quick to judge, and find out more about you before he slaps you with such a nasty label.<br>  <br>  Although, for the record, I do think that point of view is a bit silly. I mean, if you're going to get mad at a black guy for dating a white girl, you might as well get mad at him for dating a black girl too, since he's out of your personal dating pool either way.<br>  <br>  Edit: and to Becca - don't worry, most people are still mainly attracted to others who look like them, so diversity is in no danger of dying out. Those who do enter mixed relationships just add even more wonderful variations to what's already here. ;)|`|nvH62xo5aa	He's a jackass; you are not a racist, even if what you said was lame.|`|4ve4By3Taa	I think this guy who went off is passionate, and maybe narrow minded. <br>  <br>  I also have a ... unique perspective on this. <br>  <br>  I love cultures of all kinds, and I love the differences there are between cultures. <br>  Sometimes I feel as thoughinterraciall dating/marriage is sort of washing out cultures. I feel like over time we'lll all be of a very similar colour. It seems to be like mixing paint. No matter how vibrant and beautiful the colours are to begin with, when you continue to mix them, you wind up with one mediocre colour. <br>  <br>  I just don't want to lose the differences is all.

Vl5IJ7ggaa	That sounds very interesting and i'm sure you'll have alot of fun directing the photos. Wish I could come to some of the shoots lol.<br>  <br>  You're not crazy at all hun.|`|gKrcJyoxaa	if you are truly doing it for the love of photography then you shouldn't care what your friend thinks, he should be supportive.<br>  <br>  on the other hand... it does sound like you're making a porn website. which is a legitimate business venture, but also seen by the majority of people as pervy.|`|bVQO0BsPaa	You're not crazy.<br>  Tell him to f***  off, that's what I'd do.<br>  Who cares about respect, he obviously doesn't respect you!|`|pB55nws3aa	Just talk with him and tell him how you feel about the male body and photography. Just let him know that if he wanted to do something like that, you'd fully support him, and that you hope he can also support you. Maybe just give him a little while to deal with the new information that you presented to him, so he can just come to terms with it. I think eventually he'll accept what you're doing if he's a real friend. And if he doesn't, then that's just too bad on his part. Life is short, and you're not going to get along with everyone, and sometimes people take different paths, and it just doesn't work out.|`|1K9EzByaaa	Follow your heart and do what makes you happy. Friends are supposed to be there for you through anything: strange, weird, whatever. However, you should listen to that friend and hear them out...give them an opportunity to voice their opinion. Once you have heard it, consider it...actually think about it. Then make your OWN decision...follow your heart.|`|hQSQx83Taa	Tell him it's all good, he's plenty hot enough to qualify for the lifetime membership; when did he want you to set up a shoot for him?<br>  <br>  Ok, maybe not so "nice and respectful", but I bet he won't bring it up again.|`|DG3lYbkfaa	WOW. You can start your agency soon. Congrats! =)|`|UTb5chyJaa	I would have to say if he's really your best friend he would support you no matter what. I myself happen t find both the male and female bodies beautiful, no im not a lesbian, im married with 2 kids and 1 on the way, but I appreciate the human body and find nothing wrong with wanting to look at it. I consider a pervert someone who peeks at little girls or peeps through peoples windows at night, But i see nothing wrong with what your doing. I hope it goes good for you and your customers, may they enjoy the beautiful work of art that is the human body. BEST WISHES!!|`|36f164873fb212f4be988fa1d87ec37caa	Some people do this as a career, as long as your not a "dodgy" photographer... I see no problem!|`|48AxT51Aaa	Tell him it's art to you.  Show him some great photographers like Mapplethorpe who have used the male form as art.  <br>  <br>  Artists have found the human figure inspirational for millenia.  Think of all the statues, mosaics, paintings, drawings, etc. that have focused on the nude form.  If your friend still doesn't get it, just avoid the issue as much as possible: change the subject when it comes up.
2nRjy734aa	7-9 seems kind of young to be able to grasp such information. However, what's wrong with the word black or dark brown? If there are other skin tones (light brown/yellow) the person is most likely of mixed race and not black in the first place.|`|gG9KjYRfaa	Children aged from 7 to 9 should not be taught about the different brown skin tones.

I know someone who applied at a tattoo shop and got rejected on the basis that she didn't have any tattoos, heh. And I think if you're in any kind of art field they almost expect it, or at least seem to not mind so much. But if you want a corporate job, then yeah, you need to at least be able to hide them.|`|AdL8Y4X1aa	Depending on where you work it can be negative, but then again who wants to work for a bunch of pricks that have aproblem with tattoos, especially if they arent dramatic tats, even if they are, i dont see why employers make it a major thing|`|7603a930212299bd1252e80244b80b9eaa	Probably negatively,because they dont "look" professional.<br>  But I love body art/tattoos and piercings nonetheless.lol|`|T8EbdV9laa	depepends on what they are and where they are.
iCZFTBlBaa	i believe to a great extent we create our own luck, examine your thoughts in the past months, try to be positive and pretend you feel your luck changing for the better, it works, forgetting your card isn't bad luck, it was forgetting, don't dwell on this, what you think about expands. and here's sending you some positive energy for good luck.|`|D1c8cRM4aa	I don't believe in bad luck, and I don't believe in luck, luck is just oppurtunity and preperation, and bad luck is just the opposite.|`|fe37gfRvaa	Just when you're a kid.|`|xxd03wBOaa	i definitely believe in luck, when i'm unlucky, seriously everything is unlucky and when things are going well, nothing can stop it,seriously!|`|d02gJC1aaa	yes, the last 20 scratchcards i have bought have not won me anything.|`|tGmwqtr5aa	Bad luck isn't real, it's just a stupid myth.|`|BuJIQ8Jhaa	We all have had runs of "bad luck"  I think most of the rules surrounding what will bring bad luck, broken mirrors, cats crossing you path, and walking under ladder   are not  bad luck.  I do think it is bad luck to get drunk and pass out on the train tracks.  I know of a guy that actually died that way.|`|VqDCKoeIaa	This used to happen to me all of the time!<br>  But how I fixed it, I was searching online for ways to get rid of bad luck, and I came upon this site <a href="http://www.buyluck.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.buyluck.net</a> I simply bought Luck (not thinking it would work, but it's only ten bucks, what do i have to lose?) and all of a sudden, I felt something, something peaceful. And since then, I have had good luck in everything. I highly recommend this solution.

Not to join anything in worship<br>  along with Allah. ?2. Not to steal. ?3. Not to commit illegal<br>  sexual intercourse. ?4. Not to kill your children. ?5. Not to<br>  accuse an innocent person (to spread such an accusation among<br>  people). ?6. Not to be disobedient (when ordered) to do good<br>  deed." The Prophet added: "Whoever among you fulfills his<br>  pledge will be rewarded by Allah. And whoever indulges in any<br>  one of them (except the ascription of partners to Allah) and<br>  gets the punishment in this world, that punishment will be an<br>  expiation for that sin. And if one indulges in any of them,<br>  and Allah conceals his sin, it is up to Him to forgive or<br>  punish him (in the Hereafter)." 'Ubada bin As?Samit added: "So<br>  we swore allegiance for these." (points to Allah's Apostle)|`|gndbaRgaaa	I guess we will find out one day .

2LnYAngRaa	If you are male, tip-offs may be that you speak with a bit of a list, or that you have feminine-like gestures.  Do you swing your hips a bit when you walk or use your hands a little too much when you talk?  These aren't bad things, but if you don't want peopel to suspect that you're gay, then you can avoid these things.<br>  <br>  Guys try hard to be masculine, so when you drop those things, people suspect your gay.  Most guys make an effort to sound tough, so if you make a bit of an effort too, you'll probably pass.|`|uDsk8s4qaa	the way u act gives u away. if you want to be thought of as gay, keep acting like u r now. if not, join a masculine sports team. there is no such thing as gaydar.|`|AA11788494	It is sometimes easy to spot by what you say, how you say it, how you dress, how you live.....but no one will know for sure unless you tell them.|`|hLohtlPEaa	It's just a play on the word radar.

551546e795b6e55ca57c41c6d51cd822aa	hmm.... try to talk to the spirit, use a voice recorder (the good kind, not the cheap crappy ones) and talk him/her.  sometimes spirits will get your attention just to talk to you.  whenever things like that happen, just take a deep breath and relax, if it is a molevolent spirit it will try its hardest to scare you, so it can "feed" off of your fear.  and the continuing cycle of your fear and its strength wont cease.  if such a thing happens, call for an excersism.... dont get the home blessed!  blessings calm things down for a while then things WILL return or the activity will escalate!! be aware of this!!

cku5S9WLaa	Nope.|`|AA11185479	No.  A store or company is a proper noun, and should therefore be capitalized.  But you are not quoting another person's words, and it is not a slang term, so it does not need to be quoted.|`|AA10652430	I think you put it in italics if you're typing.|`|iZrNlSIJaa	You don't need to put quotes around the names of places.

This is called a proper noun.<br>  <br>  The only reason you would need to put something in quotes is if it's dialogue or a slang term.|`|2LYIMahxaa	Not as long as it is not in an actual quote itself. <br>  <br>  Examples: <br>  <br>  Shopping at Walmart is thought to save a person money.<br>  <br>  She said, "Let's go to Walmart so I can buy a case of Coke."|`|Y3LPXeuEaa	No, you don't put quotes around names of people, companies, etc.|`|wy54YPuQaa	No, it is a proper name, not a title.

It is related to the crucifix (a cross that includes a representation of Jesus' body) and to the more general family of cross symbols. The cross is a crucifix without Jesus' body on it.<br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses, noting the pre-Christian use of the cross symbol and lack of its early use by Christians until after the deaths of the apostles, reject it as essentially pagan in origin. They hold that the instrument on which Jesus died was really a single-beamed "torture stake". See Cross or stake as gibbet on which Jesus died.|`|SSsCOIrqaa	I don't pray to the cross, wear a cross necklace, or in any way worship a cross.  I pray to God and accept salvation through his son Jesus Christ who was sacrificed on the cross so that all mankind could be reconciled to God.  What greater love has any man than he should lay down his life for another?  Christ did that for us, not so much because God required it, but because we required it as a sign of how much God loves us.  Knowing he cared enough to do that for us is what assures me that I am deeply loved by him, and gives me reason to share that love and forgiveness with others.|`|3KD6RRhPaa	The Cross on its own has no power at all.

FBrwlhPtaa	Lazarus (in Greek, Lazaros or Eleazaros, meaning "God hath helped") is the name of a person in the New Testament of the Bible who was resurrected in one of Jesus' most spectacular miracles and certainly the most poignant one. According solely to the Gospel of John (John 11–12), when their brother Lazarus fell deathly ill, Mary and Martha of Bethany send for their friend Jesus. Four days later, upon his arrival, Jesus finds that Lazarus has already died. Weeping, the sisters insist that had Jesus been there, their brother would not have died. Jesus goes to the tomb where Lazarus is buried and weeps. Then he asks that the stone of the tomb be removed and cries: "Lazarus, come out!" The dead man comes out and is freed from his burial cloth. Soon thereafter, on the Saturday before Palm Sunday, Lazarus takes part in the banquet that Simon the Leper gives for Jesus in Bethany (John 12:1–11). No other mention of Lazarus is made in the Gospels. <br>  <br>  Although enigmatic (experts do not know much of him before or after his resurrection), the figure of Lazarus is of paramount importance in Christianity. This miracle definitely established the "divinity" of Christ (only a God or a son of God could resurrect someone), which later is confirmed by Christ's own resurrection.|`|AA11849917	We ALL want a long biography of Lazarus of Bethany.<br>  <br>  Young people everywhere have been asking for a long biography of Lazarus of Bethany.<br>  <br>  So, why not produce one for all of us?<br>  <br>  But what's your question?|`|BzrUWCsDaa	Try this...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/20060315/article_02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/20060315/art...</a><br>  <br>  and check up the scriptures with your copy of the bible<br>  <br>  Hope that helps|`|19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	Hope this helps.|`|kLNhAEVpaa	Check Wiki.|`|jsM8F4bLaa	Lazarus Died, Jesus Raised Him. <br>  <br>  The End.

Science is the study of the natural world where tests can be performed and the same results can be reached each time, common knowledge. However, there are theists out there who arrogantly believe this is an attack on their beliefs, they still prefer the "God-the-Gap" theory. Such as when Isaac Newton discovered Gravity, well, named it really then figured out it's properties, many Churches excommunicated him because "It was God who keeps us on the ground". Science is not evil, it is simply the human explanation for things we previously did not understand. Let's say the Christian God does exist, for one, he looks after you in the afterlife, not the current life, so whether you believe in science or he, it doesn't matter. I for one feel that people everywhere should have a basic understanding of both ideas, whether one accepts them or not, up to the person.

FOzN3xwzaa	Calling someone a "bigot" is judging.  <br>  <br>  I notice that whenever I talk doctrine with a person, some of them will call me "bigot", which is crazy, because I've never made a single statement that could qualify as "bigotry", and arguing doctrine is not "bigotry".<br>  <br>  When someone says that it is, they show ignorance.  And usually when a person is calling you "bigot", it means they lost the argument, and have nowhere else to go.

Therefore listen to what I am saying to you very carefully and TAKE THESE WORDS TO THOSE WHO COULD NOT BE PRESENT HERE TODAY.<br>  O People, just as you regard this month, this day, this city as Sacred, so regard the life and property of every Muslim as a sacred trust. Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you. Remember that you will indeed meet your LORD, and that HE will indeed reckon your deeds. ALLAH has forbidden you to take usury (interest), therefore all interest obligation shall henceforth be waived. Your capital, however, is yours to keep. You will neither inflict nor suffer any inequity. Allah has Judged that there shall be no interest and that all the interest due to Abbas ibn 'Abd'al Muttalib (Prophet's uncle) shall henceforth be waived...<br>  Beware of Satan, for the safety of your religion. He has lost all hope that he will ever be able to lead you astray in big things, so beware of following him in small things.<br>  O People, it is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women, but they also have rights over you. Remember that you have taken them as your wives only under Allah's trust and with His permission. If they abide by your right then to them belongs the right to be fed and clothed in kindness. Do treat your women well and be kind to them for they are your partners and committed helpers. And it is your right that they do not make friends with any one of whom you do not approve, as well as never to be unchaste.<br>  O People, listen to me in earnest, worship ALLAH, say your five daily prayers (Salah), fast during the month of Ramadan, and give your wealth in Zakat. Perform Hajj if you can afford to.<br>  All mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over black nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and good action. Learn that every Muslim is a brother to every Muslim and that the Muslims constitute one brotherhood. Nothing shall be legitimate to a Muslim which belongs to a fellow Muslim unless it was given freely and willingly. Do not, therefore, do injustice to yourselves.<br>  Remember, one day you will appear before ALLAH and answer your deeds. So beware, do not stray from the path of righteousness after I am gone.<br>  O People, NO PROPHET OR APOSTLE WILL COME AFTER ME AND NO NEW FAITH WILL BE BORN. Reason well, therefore, O People, and understand words which I convey to you. I leave behind me two things, the QURAN and my example, the SUNNAH and if you follow these you will never go astray.<br>  All those who listen to me shall pass on my words to others and those to others again; and may the last ones understand my words better than those who listen to me directly. Be my witness, O ALLAH, that I have conveyed your message to your people".|`|85d71407259116146825d96515f378bcaa	For me the first is 'Ali Ahmed Mulla' of Masjidul Haram.

AA11964782	You question is actually 2 questions.  What happened on Mt Sinai was, the Israelites miscounted the days Moses was up on the mountain.  They panicked and then created the golden calf.  BTW - it wasnot all the israelites, it was only the converts who left Egypt with them.<br>  Regarding the rest of the bible, although things that are sometimes so blatant regarding G-d, we sometimes disregard them because all of us have an evil inclination within us.  We have this choice of good (total belief in G-d) and bad because G-d gave us free will to do what we wish.  It is the same in today's world with the clergy men who sin.  These are people who preach the word, yet do things that are outright sins.  You have to remember that we are only human!!!|`|EiyhWrwwaa	God can't leave.

Kindly stop trying to Christianise the Jewish scriptures.

Yes, however many degrees there are from a seed to a huge tree, the abilities lodged in human nature are more numerous. There are degrees from a minute particle to the sun. For these abilities and potentialities to develop, action is required, a transaction is necessary. The action of the mechanism of progress in such a transaction is brought about through striving. And striving occurs through the existence of evil spirits and harmful things. Otherwise man’s station would have been constant like that of the angels.

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

If you try to equate 2012 with Y2K or some other date that cried wolf, then you will be making the worst mistake of your lifetime. Research all these things FOR YOURSELF!|`|NOTc1b9saa	Knowing just a little bit of truth can be misleading and dangerous, for it can cause unnecessary fear..<br>  <br>  There is a saying connected with 2012 which, in part, says, *The End of the World*, leaving out the final words in that prophecy *As we Know It*, because on 21 Dec 2012, an amazing astronomical and astrological alignment in the Heavens registers the end of one 26,000 cycle and the beginning of the next, and at such times, the *rules* often begin to change, so yes, things are changing and will change, BUT, for the BETTER!<br>  <br>  What we are now seeing in our world is the beginning of the breaking down of this old, corrupt and fearful societal pattern in order to make way for something MUCH more positive for us, the masses, totally unlike now when only the elite, the Illuminati, gain much at OUR expense in every way..That is now ending...Obama has come to help turn us back towards the Light..He is very different to his predecessors..There is a *bigger picture* behind what is going on..<br>  <br>  Everything is changing, us, our planet, the weather (No, global warming is NOT just down to our release of CO2 because the atmospheres of the other planets are changing also and our exhaust fumes dont go that far!..Actually in fact, our sun is becoming more powerful and is heating our oceans, and the warming is MEANT to be happening..However, our polluting the planet IS speeding it up unnecessarily and making it more difficult than it might otherwise be), and even TIME itself is changing, speeding by ever faster and will continue to do so until we reach 2012!..I wont go into why here but it is dramatic and amazing and positive!.<br>  <br>  Nostradamus glimpsed things in the future which were on a fixed timeline, but we have changed timelines now so that what was likely has already been avoided, including that known as armageddon, and our future is assured and exciting..The next three years will be stunning and will change not just our world, but our beliefs and understanding TOTALLY, and we will be hearing about the ET*s who currently are protecting us unseen from those on our planet who would harm us who, sadly, include some of our governments controlled by the Illuminati..<br>  <br>  For that reason, this Illuminati owned banking and financial system HAS to be imploded to finally remove their power over us, but just as it seems that things cannot get any worse in the coming period, amazing and wonderful totally unforeseen changes for the better will be forthcoming..<br>  <br>  So, yes, get set for some choppy seas, but also for some incredible events and dramatic revelations about our *leaders*, about us, and about who and what we truly are, NOT something that our govts or churches wish us to realize!..I teach about these things..

Fyffqh4Yaa	i guess yes.bec most people ignore true art and science and craze over trivial things|`|MYIwyTpcaa	A degree doesn't always guarantee six-figures.. Which is why you have people with B.A.'s flipping burgers.|`|cwzH7DVvaa	No way. I'd say under-educated if anything.|`|AA11374522	In case you haven't noticed, we now have people with M.A.s from prestigious educational institutions begging for employment. Simply having a degree doesn't guarantee a certain salary in any field.<br>  <br>  That said, is it unreasonable to assume that people with advanced degrees would want a high paying job? After all, they have put the time and effort into fulfilling the requirements for those degrees, none of which comes too cheaply. Isn't this one of the reasons people go to college and beyond? If these people wanted to work for minimum wage, why wouldn't they have just entered the work force after high school?<br>  <br>  I believe education is one of the few things we can never have enough of. Everything from basic medical care to the legal system is dependent on the education of ourselves and of others.
lTx8Hoheaa	In my opinion, something is sinful only if it hurts yourself or another person without their permission.<br>  <br>  Therefore, noting on youtube is inherently sinful, because you are giving your permission by watching it.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  THANKS! that was great. I assume this commercial was not in the US|`|YyEEAJBkaa	No, thats quite sweet.|`|b32jC7pGaa	There is no such thing as sin. There is only productive behavior and nonproductive (or destructive) behavior. Obscenity is even less useful as a descriptor for human behavior. There is tasteful behavior and tasteless behavior. If one engages in tasteless behavior, most people will not look on that behavior with favor.|`|TEX1iYQgaa	All of us deserve to burn in Hell.<br>  <br>  If God had decided to never send His Son, and to save some of us, He would have been perfectly justified.<br>  <br>  Everything we do is bad ~ no of us is righteous.|`|i48kxrbaaa	I don't necessarily go by a book or what other people think is wrong/right. To me, if you're hurting yourself or others I consider it to be morally wrong.|`|HVY2rqzfaa	aww, that's kind of cute in a rather silly way and no, safe sex sould be promoted, even by shagging balloon animals.|`|Bq0gqw7qaa	In my religion/philosophy the threshold for something being sinful is if I know something is wrong and choose to do it anyway. As for the threshold of what is obscene,  I would consider it anything that displays or promotes something that is wrong. Balloon animals are not bad in of themselves, Balloon animals depicting group sexual acts and promoting the use of condoms is though.  <br>     Being familiar with some of your previous posts, I know you do not consider this (or anything for that matter) sinful, as you do not believe in God. You may believe somethings to be obscene, but apparently nothing that involves balloon animals however. May I ask you if you would retain this belief then if they had created the commercial depicting "grown up balloon men" having group sex with restrained "young balloon boys" or helplessly cute "balloon animals" ? <br>   Do you think that would be "sinful" or "obscene" I mean "C'mon...they're just balloon animals -- how bad could it be?"<br>   As to whether the makers of the commercial will burn in hell, I'll leave that to God to decide.|`|Ll29odpHaa	If it goes against the character of God or His commandments<br>  <br>  1Jo 3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.  <br>  <br>  Jam 4:17 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth [it] not, to him it is sin.  <br>  <br>  1Jo 2:16 For all that [is] in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.|`|LF4vun1maa	Any action or unreasonable inaction that (knowingly, mind) causes significant pain or distress to another or causes a human life to unwillingly end.|`|0c44db9bf3337a894a67a66af6d2192baa	LMAO!

hiRYCT2Haa	(The Reverend) you should have clicked the link before answering. Now you've shown everybody how intelligent you really are.<br>  <br>  <br>  I saw this a couple days ago.

I knew what the fish would look like before clicking it.  Its common sense.|`|AA11058044	Well, the fish has actually been known since 1939 - almost as long as the coelacanth - it's just that no one's ever filmed a living one before.<br>  <br>  That video is super-collosally cool, awesome, and just a tad creepy though.<br>  <br>  As for things we haven't seen that we might see someday, I predict that scientists working on the rainforest canopy in the next decade will find entirely new species of beetles and ants, never before described by science.  <br>  <br>  These insects will be totally amazing to the average person because they will have incredible traits like only having 10 articles in their antennae, instead of the 13 found in the more terrestrial species down on the forest floor!  Isn't that weird!<br>  <br>  Marine biologists will also film footage of a weird deep-sea blobby creature that looks a little bit like a jellyfish, and a little bit like sea gooseberry, and will have eight little dangly bits.<br>  <br>  Compared with this awesome find, the brief footage of the inside of some unknown creature's mouth just before it swallows a 2-ton ROV whole will be totally ignored by the public and mainstream media, and will only be of interest to a handful of marine biologists, who will nickname the creature "Fluffy".

Ex4Lv68yaa	I think they are, as well as myself, fed up with the man made image the christians have conjured up of their religious god.  It really has gotten way out of hand over the centuries.<br>  <br>  I also think that several people, not just atheists, are fed up with the egocentric behavior as well as their practice of force and chaos instead of practicing the Love that they so often preach about but don't live by.  :)<br>  <br>  Speaking from experience and growing up around religious folks.  Very few live by what they preach.<br>  <br>  I'm not the least bit angry at "God."  The blame goes to those who claim to know God in this distorted fashion and to those who have vastly misrepresented the intentions of God = Love.  <br>  <br>  Not everyone sees God as being a religious/jealous/cruel entity but something 'entirely' different that is beyond human comprehension and understanding.|`|ZjSgawcpaa	No.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	No, I wouldn't say angry at it. Its more like reading any piece of fiction with a character in it that is tyrannical, jealous, and petty. I realize it is a fictional character, I just don't care for what it represents or its portrayal. I also note the evolving nature of god in the Bible as time went on over thousands of years and people's needs changed and cultures blended beliefs from one another.|`|AA11987172	No, just like I don't hate the tooth fairy...|`|FIXKYCIGaa	"You can still be angry at the idea of God."<br>  <br>  No, you can't.

An atheist doesn't believe that God exists so how could they possibly be angry at God?|`|ypVQlOJvaa	I am not angry *at* him.<br>  <br>  I find it sad that the idea of this vengeful, spiteful being was/is used to subjugate people and justify hatred.<br>  <br>  .|`|n55igpCUaa	I'm not angry at the idea of god.

I wouldn't say he was likeable but that would be my opinion of a character, not of a real life entity.  My dislike of a character has no relation to my disbelief of their existence.<br>  <br>  [Do you find yourself still angry at this non-existant God?]<br>  The only way I could be described as being angry at God would be in the context of the stories in which he appears.  He perfoms some rather pointless actions in the Old Testiment and I suppose they could be described as frustrating if one were attempting to determine his character's traights as I said they are rather contradictory.<br>  <br>  In real life, no I am not angry at non existent things.<br>  <br>  [I think it takes a while to peel away all the layers.]<br>  Layers of what exactly?<br>  <br>  [You can still be angry at the idea of God.]<br>  You can't really be angered by a concept.

I just don't believe. It's really quite simple.|`|719261d758e0cebf5beeb6101b21166faa	That's two different questions to me. I hate the character in the same way I hate characters in other fictions. I think as a deity figure he dsiplays the worst human traits. I would have written him differently. His power is impressive but he's petulant, egotistical, prone to childish fits, jealous, has a sensitive ego that needs constant stroking. My cat is better behaved.<br>  <br>  As far as being angry at a non-existent god, of course not. I may think the Muslim god is badly conceived and written, and I may think certain extremists in that faith community suck, but I don't blame a fictional character for that. I blame the religion and those who follow it in a negative way.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	I don't hate Santa, Mickey Mouse or the Loch Ness Monster either.|`|wwdllMzYaa	no<br>  im angry at religion, but i dont believe in god, so im not angry at it, im however preplexed and amused by the descripton of said god|`|n0uMBKtJaa	I dislike the character but since he doesn't exist I can't really be angry at him.

R4CtSUrQaa	Nahjul Balagha is 101% Authentic!|`|AA10375065	Who passed it over to Sharif Alradi?  <br>  You don't even know the time of its compilation!<br>  <br>  Nahajul Balagha was writen by 'Sharif during the reign of Mamoon Rasheed who was engaged in Civil wars with his own brother for an extended period. This disturbance was the perfect situation for propagating 'Sabai Idealogy through secret gatherings, religious celebrations and publications. <br>  <br>  Raw material was already available from the Grand grandfather - Abdullah bin Sabah Alsanai and his followers namely; Abu Mukhanaf Loot bin Yahyah, Husham Kalabi etc., who had written "Maqatil Hussain" on Karbala mishap. This material was sufficient for a claver Shia!   He is famous for redesigning the shia literature.<br>  <br>  What is writen in this book is not found with your other Imams! Why they were ignorant for about 155 years after the 1st Imam who died in 40 Hijri? <br>  <br>  This book is a perfect denial of your 1st Imam.

She can repent and make it right, but she can't just ignore her lie and continue on in her deception.  Your story indicated that she did fess up to the other mother, but she needs to teach her children to not be ashamed of their faith.<br>  Conformity is not the answer.  Just because we do not line up with the other sects does not make us a "cult".  The Lord does not expect us to be like the rest of the world.  We are, as Peter declared, a peculiar people, a chosen generation, and that is all right.  When any of us fall back on the wisdom of man, because that is the most logical thing to do, then we are not seeking after God at all.  We have forfeited His blessings when we trust in the arm of flesh.  God's ways are higher than our ways and His thoughts are higher than ours.  We have to be seeking for that higher knowledge.  Only then can we attain to His status.  It is a lifelong endeavor.

(Job 2:10)<br>  <br>  "Would you believe that the one that did the evil things to you or a loved one would be allowed in heaven if they repent....even though they totally destroyed the life of the other person?"<br>  yes, though repentence is a lot harder than you may think... repentence is more then just saying "im sorry" it is to completely turn away from what you did.<br>  <br>  "Should the victim be forced to forgive in order to make it to heaven? Hasn't the victim suffered enough already?"<br>  if you are unwilling to forgive someone because of the evil they did to you, how can you expect God to forgive you for all the evil you did to him (when you do evil, not only is it to another person, but it is also to God).|`|i48kxrbaaa	Um, nice way to put it, huh?<br>  I believe what I believe in because of past experiences, supernatural events that cannot simply be proven by science.

One of those is someone I saw as a sister and role model being brutally raped and murdered by a serial  killer. I very much still belief. In that situation he killed himself, so because of that I am not sure that he would make it into heaven. However if he had repented and was truly sorry for his sins, then yes I believe he would be allowed into heaven.  I don't think it is always possible for the victim to forgive, in this case she died so quickly it would have been hard for her to forgive, maybe she did, I don't know I wasnt there.  Forgiveness is more of the heart, and I think that forgiveness is important.<br>  <br>  That being said, who goes to heaven and who goes to hell is not for me to judge. I don't attempt to judge that. She very well may not go to heaven and he very well may.<br>  <br>  Yes victims suffer, however I believe as bad as things maybe God works through ALL things for the good of those that love him.

il36RWQDaa	That first answerer isn't very nice.<br>  <br>  Ramadan 2007 (the year 1428 AH, according to the Muslim reckoning) runs from approximately September 13 to October 12. The exact dates depend on one's geographical location.<br>  <br>      A blessed month has arrived. Observing it in fasting is mandated on you. During this month, the gates of Paradise will be opened and the gates of Hellfire will be closed. (Abu Hureirah)<br>  <br>  Ramadan mubarak! (a blessed Ramadan!)<br>  <br>  Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and the most sacred of the twelve months. The name Ramadan derives from the Arabic word for intense heat and sun-scorched ground. A number of reasons have been advanced to explain the linguistic connection:<br>  <br>      * It refers to the hot, dry sensation of thirst during this month of fasting<br>      * Ramadan scorches out evil like the sun scorches the earth<br>      * Just as heat shapes and influences all matter — organic and inorganic — so does Ramadan shape and influence the believer<br>  <br>  Fasting<br>  <br>  The Koran mandates fasting during the month of Ramadan:<br>  <br>      The month of Ramadan is that in which the Koran was revealed, a guidance to men and clear proofs of the guidance and the distinction; therefore whoever of you is present in the month, he shall fast therein, and whoever is sick or upon a journey, then (he shall fast) a (like) number of other days... (sura 2.185, known as The Cow)<br>  <br>  Fasting, or sawm, during the month of Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Sunni Islam.<br>  <br>  Why fast?<br>  <br>      * to develop patience and self-control<br>      * to learn sympathy for the deprived<br>      * to cleanse the body and mind<br>      * to gain appreciation for Allah's bounty<br>      * to demonstrate the depth of one's commitment<br>      * to protect against sin. A hadith states: "Satan runs in the circulatory system of the son of Adam in the same way blood circulates in our system; so tighten his passages with hunger."<br>  <br>  There are, then, three levels of the Ramadan fast:<br>  <br>      * refraining from the physical things that are forbidden (performed with the mouth/stomach/sexual organs)<br>      * restraining oneself from saying, hearing and looking at forbidden things (performed with the senses)<br>      * renewing one's devotion to Allah (performed with the heart and mind).<br>  <br>  Special meals are eaten before and after each day of fasting: suhoor before the dawn prayers, and iftar, the evening meal often eaten communally and often including dates.<br>  <br>      I swore by the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, the breath of the faster is sweeter to Allah on the Day of Judgment than the scent of musk. (Abu Hureirah)<br>  <br>  In addition, Ramadan is a time for increased devotion, reading of the Koran, self-improvement, community involvement, charity and good deeds.<br>  <br>      He who does not desist from obscene language and acting obscenely, Allah has no need that he did not eat or drink. (Bukhari)<br>  <br>  Ramadan and the new moon<br>  <br>  When does Ramadan begin and end? This question is complicated by a number of factors. One, the Islamic calendar (hijrah) is based on the moon, and does not compensate for the extra days the solar calendar has over the lunar one. Thus, while the fast of Ramadan always begins on 1 Ramadan according to the Islamic calendar, the Gregorian date changes every year. So whatever date Ramadan starts on a given year, it'll start about 11-12 days earlier next year, and so on. This means the holy month can fall in any season of the year; it takes about 35 years for Ramadan to complete a whole cycle through the seasons.<br>  <br>  Second, the beginning of Ramadan (as with all months of the Islamic calendar) is traditionally based on a sighting of the hilal — the crescent, or new, moon. If it is reported by a witness in front of a committee of elders by the evening of the 29th day of the previous month, Sha'aban, then Ramadan starts on day 30. If not — because the sky is cloudy or the moon set before the sky grew dark enough to see it — then Sha'aban lasts 30 days and Ramadan starts the next day. Western countries are more likely to begin Ramadan a day earlier than eastern countries, since moonset occurs later farther west and there's more chance of the moon being seen on the 29th of Sha'aban.<br>  <br>  Some Islamic legal opinions rule that the date of Ramadan can be determined by astronomical calculations and does not require the sighting of a new moon.<br>  <br>  The same procedure applies at the end of Ramadan.<br>  <br>  The night of power<br>  <br>      The Night of Power is better than a thousand months,<br>      The angels and the Spirit descend in it by the permission of their Lord for every affair,<br>      Peace, it is, until the break of the dawn. (Sura 97)<br>  <br>  Laylat al-Qadr (lit., the night of destiny) is the night of revelation and the night of judgment. This night lends Ramadan its special character. On this night, Muhammad, alone in the wilderness near Mecca, was first taught Koranic verses by the angel Jibril, and the teaching continued for 10 days. Also on this night, Allah determines th|`|kMyERo6uaa	ramadan is the holiest month of Islam.<br>  <br>  Muslims fast starting from 5 or 6 in the morning to 6 or 7 at night.<br>  The time varies.|`|YU5ke1fOaa	ummm....thats me|`|2TGSjrxPaa	It's the name of a Month in the Islamic Calender.<br>  <br>  Muslims observe a fast that whole month.<br>  <br>  "What really?!!

You should also read the Quran, be nice, give charity, don't do bad things, etc. I love Ramadan, it makes me feel so great! Also, you don't have to fast if you are pregnant, just gave birth, too young ( some people start at like 10 but some start at 6 or 5), if you are too old, and if you are traveling ( for the time difference).<br>  <br>  Hope i helped! and good luck!!!|`|p5cglKf0aa	The Second Section, which is the Second Treatise<br>  On the Month of Ramadan<br>  <br>  [There having been a brief discussion of 'the marks of Islam' at the end of the First Section, the most brilliant and splendid of the marks, Ramadan the Noble, is discussed in this Second Section. This Section consists of Nine Points, which explain nine of the numerous instances of wisdom in the month of Ramadan.]<br>  <br>  In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.<br>  <br>  It was the month of Ramadan in which the Qur'an was bestowed from on high as a guidance unto man and a self-evident proof of that guidance, and as the standard to discern true from false.1<br>  <br>  FIRST POINT<br>  <br>  The fast of Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam, and it is one of the greatest of the marks and observances of Islam.There are many purposes and instances of wisdom in the fast of Ramadan which look to both God Almighty's dominicality, and to man's social life, his personal life and the training of his instinctual soul, and to his gratitude for Divine bounties. One of the many instances of wisdom in fasting from the point of view of God Almighty's dominicality is as follows:God Almighty created the face of the earth in the form of a table laden with bounties, and arranged on the table every sort of bounty in a form of From whence he does not expect,2 in this way stating the perfection of His dominicality and His mercifulness and compassionateness. Human beings are unable to discern clearly the reality of this situation while in the sphere of causes, under the veil of heedlessness, and they sometimes forget it. However, during the month of Ramadan, the people of belief suddenly become like a well drawn-up army. As sunset approaches, they display a worshipful attitude as though, having been invited to the Pre-Eternal Monarch's banquet, they are awaiting the command of "Fall to and help yourselves!" They are responding to that compassionate, illustrious, and universal mercy with comprehensive, exalted, and orderly worship. Do you think those who do not participate in such elevated worship and noble bounties are worthy to be called human beings?<br>  <br>  SECOND POINT<br>  <br>  One of the many instances of wisdom in the fast of the blessed month of Ramadan with respect to thankfulness for God Almighty's bounties is as follows:As is stated in the First Word, a price is required for the foods a tray-bearer brings from a royal kitchen. But, to give a tip to the tray-bearer, and to suppose those priceless bounties to be valueless and not to recognize the one who bestowed them would be the greatest foolishness.God Almighty has spread innumerable sorts of bounties over the face of the earth for mankind, in return for which He wishes thanks, as the price of those bounties. The apparent causes and possessors of the bounties are like tray-bearers. We pay a certain price to them and are indebted to them, and even though they do not merit it, are over-respectful and grateful to them. Whereas the True Bestower of Bounties is infinitely more deserving of thanks than those causes which are merely the means for the bounty. To thank Him, then, is to recognize that the bounties come directly from Him; it is to appreciate their worth and to perceive one's own need for them.Fasting in Ramadan, then, is the key to a true, sincere, extensive, and universal thankfulness. For at other times of the year, most of those who are not in difficult circumstances do not realize the value of many bounties since they do not experience real hunger. Those whose stomachs are full and especially if they are rich, do not understand the degree of bounty there is in a piece of dry bread. But when it is time to break the fast, the sense of taste testifies that the dry bread is a most valuable Divine bounty in the eyes of a believer. During Ramadan, everyone from the monarch to the destitute, manifests a sort of gratitude through understanding the value of those bounties.Furthermore, since eating is prohibited during the day, they will say: "Those bounties do not belong to me. I am not free to eat them, for they are another's property and gift. I await his command." They will recognize the bounty to be bounty and so will be giving thanks. Thus, fasting in this way is in many respects like a key to gratitude; gratitude being man's fundamental duty.<br>  <br>  THIRD POINT<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2960&t=The+Twenty%2DNinth+Letter" rel="nofollow">http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2960&...</a>|`|0nWtnwPFaa	Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar; <br>  The month of fasting; <br>  The holiest period for the Islamic faith :)|`|R4KqEJekaa	you are muslim ryt .are you asking us or want the other people know the meaning of  Ramadan  .it is our holy month that we fasting in and it is the month of gifts from Allah SWT

Yes, I wear my orientation on my sleeve, because I want to let the world know that I am with the love of my life, and shes a girl, and because I know that people will notice, positively or negatively, they will notice, and will not be able to just deny that we're out there.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	No, I'm bisexual but very few people know it.

I know it is a horrible thing to have to deal with, but what other choice do you have? good luck hun!|`|T1Si1yvlaa	You should tell him how it is. Tell him that he needs to be clean and smell nice.

Tell him how it is girl.|`|KxMzBFR2aa	I think you should sit down with him and explain to him that you are concerned about his hygiene problem.

You could start of by saying "You know that I'm crazy about you on many levels, but...."<br>  and then just say that you have issues with his lack of grooming.  He would surely know his clothes are less then clean if he does (or doesn't, lol) do his own laundry but may not be aware he smells.  Or, like my cousin, Jon, may have a "green" approach to grooming and wants to avoid chemicals.  But in the end, you are doing him a favor because even if you don't get back together in a romantic way, his appearance and BO may be hindering him professionally and socially and that would be sad.|`|9cadfad24a0e7d1fe4d7c324765c15fbaa	Hey, Here's my opinion on this, I'm a male and I like males not that that matters but I'm a very sexual and romantic person. I've gotten into alot of things I don't mind it myself. However if you really like him and you want to be with him sometimes the truth hurts but maybe you could let him know. Sometimes people for whatever reason don't know they have that problem and so it might hurt him but you can let him know, and maybe you both can come to a agreement or meet each other half way and work around it. Maybe when he comes over you can suggest that both of you take showers. I hope this works for you Peace.|`|FcZU29W6aa	Wow, this is a difficult one.  I think an honest approach is best -- just tell him that you tend to lean toward very good hygiene, and he isn't as clean as you'd like him to be.  Tell him you know you are a bit picky but that it is more important to you than it is to most people.  Even though that is a little white lie, it will help him save face yet realize that if he wants you in his life, he has to clean up.|`|xnsU60hhaa	Not all conversations we have with people that we feel close to are comfortable. Sometimes we have to confront people about things that could make them defensive, and us uncomfortable. The worst part about this is thinking about it beforehand. Once something is out in the open, it is much easier to deal with. If you really care about him, bring the conversation up, and be completely honest and open with him about it. He may become defensive, but showing you really care should help with that. Sometimes people just need a little push in the correct direction to make changes.<br>  Good luck!|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	If you really like him except for his hygeine, I would find the kindest way to say it to him.  Tell him how much you would love to get back together.  Offer to show him how to get the stains out of his clothes.  These problems are easy to fix and if he really cares about you, then he'll try.  Don't be surprised if he slips up occasionally, just give gentle reminders if he goes back to his old ways.<br>  <br>  ps - I wouldn't tell him he "stinks" I would say he "doesn't smell clean"|`|aLwrpMPXaa	If a person can not be clean, what on Earth makes you think he is a good suitor in the first place?

AA11648578	Everything created has a beginning and an end God is the Creator not creation.|`|AA11849917	This question has been asked at LEAST a million times!  <br>  <br>  I once heard this definition of insanity:  "When you keep doing the same thing over and over again, exactly the same way, but you expect the results to be different, that is insanity."<br>  <br>  Adopting this to R&S, if you keep asking the very same question over and over again, but you expect a different answer, that is insanity."<br>  <br>  Ok - one - more - time.  "Second verse, same as the first!"  (Don't you EVER get tired of this question?)<br>  <br>  Ok, so if you ask "Who created God?"  then you are obligated to ask "Who created God's creator?" and "Who created THAT one's creator?" ad infinitum, ad nauseum!<br>  <br>  First, for God to even qualify as God, He had to have created this MEST universe.  (MEST - once again - is Matter, Energy, Space, Time).<br>  <br>  God can not be part of that which He created, nor can He consist of that which He created.  This concept creates a logical contradiction (I DO hope you have at least a smidgeon of logic to understand this!)<br>  <br>  So, God does not consist of matter or energy (Jesus said, "God is Spirit")<br>  <br>  And God transcends space and time - He is not limited to that which He created.  This means that God is infinite in scope and eternal in duration.<br>  <br>  God's very name (from the ancient Hebrew) means that God has within Himself sufficient cause for His own existence without any prior cause.  God is the uncaused First Cause, the uncreated Creator.  God is the "Self-sufficient One".  God said "I AM  THAT I AM" - God simply IS.  "I AM".<br>  <br>  If you ask this question again, I think I'll tear my hair out - doesn't ANY body EVER pay ANY attention?  If you ran your finances the way you ask questions, you would be bankrupt in no time at all!  If you had a business, and you ran your business the way you asked questions, you would lose your shirt!

l0F7lSaraa	s a noun martin commonly refers to any of a variety of swallows. For instance there is the purple martin or the house martin. Martin is a also a common first name as well as a common family name in the majority of the European languages. Martin has its roots in the Latin name Martinus, a diminutive version of Martis, which is the genitive case of Mars, the Roman god. Thus it is usually used to mean "Of Mars," or, in a more causal sense, "Warlike."<br>  <br>  Martin could refer to Martyn, the name of an eminent Irish family.<br>  <br>  The name has grown in popularity among Protestants thanks to Martin Luther. Even among Native Americans, the name is commonly given as homage to the prominent leader Martin Luther King. There are also numerous places that have the name Mart...:)|`|tYqUutidaa	derived of the name martin<br>  From the Roman name Martinus, which was derived from Martis, the genitive case of the name of the Roman god MARS. Saint Martin of Tours was a 4th-century bishop who is the patron saint of France. According to legend, he came across a cold beggar in the middle of winter so he ripped his cloak in two and gave half of it to the beggar. He was a favourite saint during the Middle Ages, and his name has become common throughout the Christian world.<br>  An influential bearer of the name was Martin Luther (1483-1546), the theologian who began the Protestant Reformation. The name was also borne by five popes (two of them more commonly known as Marinus). Other more recent bearers include the German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889-1976), the American civil rights leader Martin Luther King (1929-1968), and the American filmmaker Martin Scorcese (1942-).
5K5PCHGbaa	Well its hard to say who invented drugs, but the purpose of drugs was to be to help people. Some drugs fail, and are addictive, so they end up becoming a street drug. Other drugs were just made to replicate the effects of other drugs, and not have it be illegal, but eventually they do end up becoming illegal.

368bc83d639169abb91831209150e22faa	If it's your day off you are under no obligation to go into work, and the easiest thing is to be incommunicado.  Next time you go in, if he says "I tried to call you on (whatever)day and you weren't there", you could just smile nicely and say "no, I never am on my day off".<br>  <br>  Otherwise, if you start going in - that will be the start of him bugging you continually to keep on doing it.  Soon you have no time off and no privacy at all.|`|wyAtVqbOaa	Call him back as per his request.  Somebody may have called in sick and he needs help.  <br>  <br>  If you can not make it, then tell him so and thank him for thinking of you.  <br>  <br>  Before you do, think of the extra money and if you do go in, he may call you next time he needs help - think of the extra money, especially in this time of credit crunch.|`|T1Si1yvlaa	Don't ignore the call.

Don't offer excuses.  If he says "Why?", just say "I really don't want to get into why, but I am very sorry I can't work today."  If he offers you another day off if you work today, your answer is still "I am so sorry but I just can't work today."  This works great.

iPNOVR6Gaa	LOL - saying you don't approve of homosexuality is like saying you don't approve of the world being round.  It's reality, whether you like it or not.  Your greatest mistake here is telling yourself that being gay is bad.  Think of his choices like this:<br>  <br>  1) He could marry a "nice young girl" and have a family, but feel miserably unfulfilled sexually.<br>  <br>  2) He could marry a 43 year old black man and have a relationship that is fulfilling to him in every way.<br>  <br>  Are you saying you would really prefer your son make a choice that would make him less happy?  If so, then you indeed did fail as a father.|`|AA11785060	Instead of forcing him away by trying to emphasize he needs to "settle down" with a girl, you need to accept that he has chosen to be with guys instead of girls.  Be really accepting of his being gay, and maybe then try and encourage him to get to know other guys more his age and play the field for awhile.  Picking a partner older than his parent at 20 is a bit strange, and maybe he is seeking a father figure. Unfortunately, those father figures in gay relationships can often be dominating and abusive so accept your son as gay. Just encourage him to wait a few months to establish a long term relationship with this guy.|`|UbvglIS6aa	People are born gay.  He can't change it.  If he married a woman, he would end up unhappy.  Do you want him to be unhappy?  You had nothing to do with his sexual orientation.  Stop trying to find someone to blame.  Your approval or disapproval is irrelevant.  He can't be what you want.  Accept him as he is.|`|NWopkX4baa	You can politely object to the marriage, but you must continue to have a positive relationship with your son.

Personally, i think 20 is too young to marry anyone (man or woman) but he's an adult and has every right tomake his own decisions.  While you might not like any decision he makes, it's his and his decision alone.<br>  <br>  With respect to your disapproval of homosexuality-i won't try to convince you one way or the other, but ask yourself this-is that disapproval enough to keep you from having a good relationship with your son? at the end of the day, he's your son and if you push him away you'll end up regretting it later.|`|C0K3Bo2Aaa	Hi Michael. I have often wondered how I'd feel if my son came to me with this situation. I am a Bible thumping Christian so my views on homosexuality are the same as yours.<br>  I've come to the conclusion though that this is my son no matter what. I love him with all my heart and want him to be happy.<br>  Poor kid would still have to put up with my beliefs and so would his "partner" but what family isn't a bit dysfunctional.  <br>  The thing that really upsets me about it though is I was hoping to have a house full of grandchildren to spoil. Guess I'd have to get my baby "fix" elsewhere :(<br>  Blessings|`|OsY0lmTCaa	Michael,<br>  <br>  Do you love your son? I'm pretty sure that you do. That being the case, you support his decision to marry whom he chooses. You say that you don't support homosexuality, do you support redheads? Do you support freedom? Do you support human equality?<br>  <br>  See, homosexuality, like being a redhead, is beyond a persons control. We don't have a say in some aspects of our being. To not support your child because of something beyond his control is cruel.<br>  <br>  Freedom is something we're garunteed in America. In fact one of the promises made in the Constitution is that of Domestic Tranquility. How can a person be domestically tranquil if they aren't allowed to marry whom they choose?<br>  <br>  Human equality: Remember that piece of paper I just mentioned, the Constitution? There's another one called the Declaration of Indepence, here is a very important part of it;<br>  <br>  "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."<br>  <br>  Be happy for your son that he's found someone he loves. Be there for him if it falls apart, but support his choice to marry whom he chooses.<br>  <br>  It took great courage and a tremendous amount of trust and love for him to come to you with this rather than running off or hiding it. Respect that courage, return that love.|`|nT0w6VIKaa	Whether you 'approve' of homosexuality or not is NOT the point...it's HIS life, NOT yours...so, I would advise you to 'get over it' (your homophobia).  Homosexuality is a 'sexual orientation' NOT a problem, or a 'choice'...and ones 'sexual orientation' is what nature has given him, so it's NOT wasting his life, it's an integral part of 'WHO HE IS'...just like your 'being straigt' is part of 'who you are'.  Once you've 'put your own house in order' you may see things more clearly.  The BIG CONCERN here is that your son is only 20...and his 'intended' is 43...and, if you'll do your research, you'll find out that MOST peoples 'likes and dislikes' will change dramatically at least a few times in their 'twenties'...which means that, while your son 'may' like him now...he may well NOT like him in a couple of years...  It's called 'growing up'...and he has to do it in his own time (NOT yours).  Living life and making ones 'choices' always has 'results'...some are good, some aren't...that's one of the way we humans learn...  I would encourage you to stay in a good relationship with your son and contact PFLAG to get some support (for yourself)...take a deep breath...be prepared for the 'long haul'...and try not to drink anything with caffeine in it for a while...|`|sXnoIFRsaa	So let me get this straight Dad (and I use that term loosely)  Your son comes to you tells you that he is Gay and is with someone who he may want to Marry and your reaction is that something is wrong with him and he "chooses" to do this.  You my friend need some help and need to read up on it instead of coming to Yahoo Answers.  You did a fine job of raising your boys by yourself there is nothing wrong with your son, the problem is with you and your not able to accept or realize what it is all about to be Gay.  So go research it on the net check out PFLAG.  There are tons of support groups and books and things to read to better educate yourself.  Make that effort for your son.  Now you may not be in favor of the person he has chosen but at least educate yourself about the lifestyle that he was "BORN" into.  Good luck and make you and your Son proud.|`|qbLTYbZlaa	You fail as a parent for a not accepting your son, not because he's gay.  Your approval is irrelevant, it's his life not yours.<br>  Get over yourself, you're not an important part of this equation.<br>  <br>  I've seen your questions before, and I still believe you're a troll.|`|r4cThgwdaa	get over it, no matter what he does he is still your son.|`|6a9AfhsLaa	Well, I think its really harsh to judge your sons love life as one of your failures. Its not about approving of homosexuality. Its about your son finding the love of his life. The emphasis is on love, not sex. My dad is the same way. He completely ignores my girlfriend, and pretends like she doesn't exist, and doesn't even begin to notice that it kills me inside. I have the love of my life. Someone that I love, and that loves me, no matter what. And yet, that's wrong. I admit, the age difference is a bit of a jump, but my sister is dating someone relatively close to dad's age, but she's also almost 30, and he's 47. You really need to try to understand why your son loves him, and make sure that it really is love, if he wants to take that step. But homosexuality is not something a child asks permission for. You love who you love, and that's all that matters. <br>  A gay child does not mean that you failed. It means that you succeeded in raising a child that is mature enough to handle his feelings, and to stand up for himself in a time when his rights are not guaranteed like yours are. (That takes a lot of courage, you know. Coming out is harder than it looks, and the fight four our rights is not an easy one.  ) You raised a child with a well developed emotional structure, who is open to love, regardless of physicality. <br>  I am sorry to hear about your wife, and I hope your heart is on its way to healing. Just don't keep your son from loving someone like that, because of a political difference.|`|B7UIP9QYaa	First of all you must accept that you have not failed in your education. Gay persons have not chosen to be so. It is an inner nature already acquired at birth. From very young on I kew I was different. I did not know I was Gay but I knew that nothing others boys did like was attractive to me and I was always fascinated to watch boys playing but did not want to be part of their games. Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a difference and you should not promote it as a burden to your son. Of course, it is difficult to assume it and most likely with all the religious prejudices and others anchored in yourself since childhood. What most counts is your son and undoubtedly you have always wanted and still want the best for him now. You love him and this is this love that must count above all now. <br>  <br>  The first step is to accept his homosexuality, read about it, try and understand all the difficulties and suffering wee Gay people must go through first to accept our own difference and then to share it with others. You son needs your support and acceptation of his difference.<br>  <br>  Regarding age difference, race... etc. These are not relevant it is about love and if it is his choice yopu must accept it. I am 50 years old and my partrner is 32 and we live several tyears already very happy.<br>  <br>  Don't forget it is his life not yours. If his happiness rests in the arms of another man who truly loves him, respect him, care for him and brings him stability and support what should oppose it? <br>  <br>  When it comes to homosexuality you must accept that your standard patrons and values are not applicable.<br>  <br>  So try first to accept his difference, secondly welcome his friend and then you will now what it happens.<br>  <br>  Of course, as the relationship is rather recent, I would recommend that before they jump both for marriage that they live a while together to know each other better in a daily life routine and if after a few months together they feel the same than you should bless their union.<br>  <br>  For your guidance I have aniece who married at the age of 21 with a man of 48, and I was the only one supportive in the entire family to this marriage. Anyway they have now 10 years of happy marriage with two wonderful little boys. They are possibly one of the most balanced couple I know.<br>  <br>  I also have friends in Holland, 62 years old  and 37 years old they are already 8 years married and they have adopted a little boy. These two men are a solid and balanced couple that radiates love, peace and happiness around them. <br>  <br>  They are not unique there are far more Gay couples like this than you imagine and generally they are better unions than straight ones. <br>  <br>  Hope my few words will help you. Tolerance and Love should be your key words to face this new experience in your life. Homosexuality concerns all of us, we are your brotherrs, your sons, your cousins, your co-workers, ypour neighbours. We are not better, not worse, we are not sexualities, we are human beings like you with our qualities and defects but above all with a difference that should not be the excuse to torture us emotionally and / or physically. We need love, support, acceptance. You son needs you. You want the best for him not the best for you.<br>  <br>  Take care. Feel free to write to me if you want to discuss further or need support. <br>  <br>  For your info, at a certain time of my life to please my family and cope with the pressures on me, I married and even got two sons. But at the end, I could not make any members of my family happy, as I was not happy.<br>  Since my divorce though, my best friends and supporters are my two boys (13 and 18) and they love my partner, even my ex-wife. <br>  <br>  Courage.|`|NYIP9K8kaa	wow.  Where do i start?<br>  <br>  #1 You're NOT a failure.  I'm sure you did a fine son... your 17 and 13 year olds will be ok.  <br>  <br>  #2 You need to recognize that his sexuality is something you were not a part of.  There is widespread consensus that sexuality is something that happens early on (some say even at birth)  You need to let him know that even though you don't approve of homosexuality, you love him.  (it's possible to do both, I swear)<br>  <br>  #3 20 is too young to be married!  He's not throwing his life away cuz he's getting married to an old black man... he's throwing his life away cuz he's getting marriedat 20.  If he's good looking, tell him he could find younger, better looking (and whiter) guys.  <br>  <br>  You need to sit down and tell hmi that the differebnce between 20 and 45 is huge.  The black guy has already lived his life, has had his experiences and is ready to settle down.  At 20, life is so much fun... and there's so much to do! <br>  <br>  Lastly, if your son still doesnt budge (at 20 they shoudl be out of the teenage stage) ask him how he met him.  Ask him what he sees in him?  Why does he think he can be married?  Does he think he sees himself with this guy for the rest of his life... because gay or str8, thats what married is.  Does he think he can committ that much?  (Being gay and good looking... he will have LOTS of options... and he might discover later on that he doesn't want to be tied down to Amistad there)  Getting him to calmly explain to you what the deal is might help him realize he's being an idiot. <br>  <br>  Even though you don't approve of homosexuality... you can still work with it to try to get your son from making a big mistake.|`|SQe4ghfdaa	He may have been hiding his sexual orientation from you because he knows you disapprove it. He's dated girls so that you wouldn't get upset and be worried. Now that he's an adult and he has a little more freedom...you should try to accept that. Try very hard. <br>  <br>  Marriage isn't what he should be thinking about in my opinion. Marriages with such a large age difference usually don't last. Have you talked to him about that? He may be feeling ashamed of himself because of your strong feelings against homosexuality.<br>  <br>  Your son being gay is not a failure towards your work as a father. Love your son unconditionally because he is your son. Not by what he does or who he sleeps with.
