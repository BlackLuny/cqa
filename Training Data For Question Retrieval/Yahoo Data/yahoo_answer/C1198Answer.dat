A scar cannot be removed. Cosmetic surgery(Laser skin resurfacing) is the closest to getting rid of any scar.And that might take alot more than one visit. So, if you have the money to risk then take that risk and find out,If not then you will be insecure for the rest of your life if it bothers you that bad. Sorry.|`|tUhs5Fyfaa	no yes no|`|iX2g7dTeaa	Maybe,,, it might work,    you should try scare recovery products and put them on your face|`|yW6KCd7iaa	what really helps to fade acne scars is to put on a face lotion with sunscreen on everymorning and night.      go to www.murad.com and they have products to help get rid of acne scars!!|`|AA11492142	I reccommend cleansing internally to address your acne scars  You'd be surprised how much toxin you can remove through diet  The human body is an incredibly efficient machine. So responsive to all we give it  You really are what you eat|`|7tnb4On2aa	If you input aspirin mask into your search engine, there are all kinds of testimonials and recipes as to the positive affects on acne scars.      Personally, I tried it once on a scar on my knee.   It burnt my skin terribly.   I have very sensitive skin.  Might I suggest you do a patch test on your leg prior to attempting to put it onto your face?
Dg0D8SCZaa	if it's a new item, wait. not all stores in a chain get merchandise at the same exact time, and sometimes stores have to sell out of existing product before they can put new stuff out. keep checking, or order online.|`|hQsvuxs3aa	it takes time, so wait....
nOMWG8SMaa	It really depends on your hair. Some hair doesn't soak up hair dye as easily, so the color fades a lot faster than on someone else.     If you've found that your hair is especially stubborn with keeping the color in, try shampoos and conditioners that elongate the life of your color.     Try brands like John Frieda, Redken, and TreSemme|`|LhfvlEWlaa	Yes. It is your going to have to dye it brown a couple more times for the color to actually stay in.    I had to dye mine 3 times before the blonde stopped coming through the dark color so fast.      Before you go and spend a lot of money on professional dying I would doSally'ss Beauty Supply dye first then doProfessionall after acouplee times of the cheaper dye.    (:|`|85506e5e2813d419f217dfc74dc60aa4aa	Red is the fastest fading of all colors. The red dye molecule is so small that it just slips right out of the hair shaft. So yeah, it's normal for hair to fade that fast, especially when you are coming from a blonde color. Just grab another box of the color you like and go for it. It should stay a little longer this time.
0atD75b8aa	I personally don't think it will suit you.  You have a very very pretty face, and just from my opinion I dont think it would look so great.|`|c5anDswjaa	Youve got such a pretty face! Eyebrow wouldnt be my first choice on you though, I think youd look great with a labret stud, a silver one with a "diamond" in it.. But if you really want the eyebrow then do it, youre hopefully doing it for YOU so you shouldnt worry about what everyone will think :)|`|fe992osaaa	no dont do it ur so pretty it will ruin u sooo bad and ur soo pretty!!!!  please dont do it ur to pretty!  hope this helps!!!!!|`|w2Z1SV1Gaa	No, don't get it. It will ruin the oh-so-cute "girl next door" look you've got goin' on.  =)|`|9cBLKOe8aa	I think a small silver barbell would look really cute on you. As long as you don't wear tacky jewelery it will look good! I have my eyebrow pierced too, and it's not gothic :P|`|nftcTLXKaa	omg u should definitely get it... u should put those small hoops. they suit u. u'll look even cuter than b4!! good luck! :D|`|jsCjGUPuaa	no u hav too much of a baby face i want to say it wouldnt look right.. i dont think that any facial piercings would fit your face... but then again i could be wrong|`|wqtwzzPeaa	I honestly don't think it's for you.|`|r98neii5aa	nope i don't think you should, get your belly done or your tragus. it'll suit you more :)|`|ZDc6dlY7aa	it depends on the person when it comes to an eyeborw piercing. i just so happen to be 15 myself, and i have seen quite a few people at my high school with eye brow piercings. i honestly think that it won't look bad, i mean, if you want it, then go ahead and get it, because there's absolutely nothing wrong with them!|`|iRRNMbQKaa	I think a nose piercing would look super cute on you ^_^|`|MfvPu75oaa	No, don't get it. You look so pretty, you'll regret it.

MWV5yxY4aa	I'm a fan of twilight, but I dislike the bracelet.|`|z9HZm6Ezaa	Love it:)  I love Twilight:)  It's about theee best book  i have ever read. It's amazing  I have not watched the movie  yet. . .but i am dyingg to see it.|`|JeOOPaYhaa	i think it's kind of tacky to wear twilight jewelry.|`|lHRF0TDcaa	no it looks a bit tacky....sry|`|dWvBhfvWaa	i do like it but i dont think you will have to explain to A LOT of people what it means so i'd try and go with something that atleast has the word cullen on it|`|RIbhvrBTaa	Ew...why would you buy a bracelet from a book series? Are you THAT obsessed?? I mean the books were good and all, but do people really have to read them over and over and over again, discuss why they didn't like the actors in the movies, and base their whole lives off those books? Seriously...what is wrong with you people?|`|EyAAFfaMaa	What was the point of even adding those stupid crests? It's not in the books, and they added it without ever even mentioning it in the movie.

H2yac1kUaa	ehh, depends what the guy's style is and how they look in them.    normally, no, but some people can get away with it    i'm NOT trying to be racist here, but i think that african-americans look REALLY good in them!|`|MitVhIK9aa	some do, some don't.  it just depends on the look they are aming for and how they look thereselves.  [=|`|ELuDCTSHaa	it depends on the girl but i think they look real real good|`|DV3Zn46Aaa	I think it depends on who they are, where you live and who you hang out with. I live in California and I think they look AMAZING on some guys and okay on others. But, my cousins live in Michigan and they think it's weird. But I'm black so that might be a factor huh? =)|`|jDscsH9Baa	NO|`|MWV5yxY4aa	It depends on the guy, if it works for him then yeah, but if they look weird, then no.

I prefer a guy in Skinny jeans.|`|IHYSej5Raa	I think they don't look good on boys or girls...    Loose fit is the way to go.|`|gmeQLvJ7aa	No. Only if your skater, if you're not then it looks weird.|`|wAOD7CCzaa	yeah all the ladies i know like guys in skinny jeans XD|`|Dg0D8SCZaa	no. regular guy jeans look best.|`|1vCoaf08aa	I think they look gay.

I like regular and skinnys on guys.|`|oZtbDrMcaa	Well ya. It depends. Some guys that are skinny and have no bulkness to themselves don't look good in them.

6xijgfxDaa	Why is so many people copying what I do?  I don't really think its intently.But okay, like my hair this semester was platinum blonde on top, and light brown on bottom.Nobody else at school had that hair color, till then somebody got it.  And then I started wearing beads, you know like those small necklace beads that are commonly worn.Well they went out of fashion at school since last year, I started wearing them for like a week or so, then everybody else started again.    And now, I barley just got my hair done a dark auburn.Nobody else had it that color there, and now there's a girl with the same hair color, except for the highlights I had.    I mean I'm not trying to say I'm great or anything, but what is wrong with people?Why are they doing this?I don't think they look at it and say their gonna do the same thing (even though one girl said she was gonna do the same hair color as me), I just don't get it.    Why are so many people copying me?|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	Maybe because your style isn't that original?|`|hQsvuxs3aa	lol your superficial|`|GmghrL4Iaa	maybe they like your style|`|7AFLaiYjaa	OMG for real.   GROW UP|`|nIflCWKOaa	I doubt you're even old enough to come up with the ORIGINAL idea, are you older than god? jesus? I think NOT. So, get over yourself. Maybe those people seen someone else and said "i want to be like..." NOT you.. loser..!!!!!!!|`|JqDkLWeTaa	I'm a nice person. But ireally hate it when people do what u do say omg im so amazing everyones copying me u kinda sound like a ***** or somthin obviously ur not but thats how anyone would take it not everyone wants to b like u ur not that amazing people might c it and think hey thats cut and do the same thing or hey maybe that would look like cute on me|`|ilTdInlFaa	oh god that guy 3 above me made me crack up|`|24cUKZDgaa	oh my god,  people like you are pathetic.  Everyone can do whatever they like,   You tend to notice people that have the same thing more after you get it.  I doubt it has anything to do with you.  So go get a life and stop looking around at what other people are doing and focus on yourself.|`|DV3Zn46Aaa	Because when people see something that looks good on one person, they think it'll look good on them and they try it. Or maybe you reminded them that "Hey! I have those beads I haven't worn in forever! I'll wear those!"    Or! Maybe you think they're copying you.|`|jyi4OZi1aa	Immitation is the highest form of flattery.  Perhaps people are too afraid to try something different until they see that it looks great on you, then they're not afraid to try it out??|`|cJPOs7Tsaa	Get over yourself. Regardless of what you may think, you're not "all-that-and-then-some."    Dark auburn? C'mon.... isn't that the most common hair color ever?|`|SKwyAVScaa	hahah diesel.    and they're probably not copying you.  there's so many people so someone's bound to have the same thing as you.  even if they are you should be flattered that you inspired them|`|rB82Ujlgaa	ok since everybody is being kinda rude I will tell you the truth usually what happens like a trend starts and just about the same time you was going to start they were also but they  were a little late because it took a little longer or someone thinks something is outta of style n they want to wear it but no one else is so when they see you wear it they think i guess its alrite|`|EZmDdNl2aa	UR LYK SOOOOO FABULUS!!!!!!!1!!1111!|`|xvtev56jaa	I don't really think its intently.But okay, like my hair this semester was platinum blonde on top, and light brown on bottom.Nobody else at school had that hair color, till then somebody got it.

Why are so many people copying me?|`|lHRF0TDcaa	get over yourself.....     you probs copied off someone else when you got your hair done or wore the beads or whatever thats what people do|`|yuy2xq8Haa	possibly because these so many people who are copying you actually look up to you, and admire your sense of style.    take it as a compliment.|`|iOY7mALWaa	LOL that dude on tha top is FUNNY!|`|uOI4Zy73aa	Maybe people are copying you because you have good taste. I would take it as a compliment honestly. They must like what they see!   Also it's true that once you notice something or do something you see it around you more often.   Example I was looking for a car online and found a really stinkin cute one. The next day I swear I saw 4 just on my way to work. I'm sure those cars have always been driving around the city but I never noticed them before until I started paying attention.    What you should do is wear some really ugly stuff and dye your hair poo green and wear that around for a week. If people copy that, then you know they have some issues. And you should confront them. :)|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	There are certain people who set trends, maybe you are one of them. Be honored.
Ymx4Im2baa	For dark circles use cucumbers and caffeinated tea bags wet. For swelling under the eyes use hemorroid cream.|`|bM4zYt44aa	stop doing drugs and get some sleep. That or you're anemic (spelling) and you need to eat more iron rich foods like spinach or take a supplement.|`|1vGz87tyaa	put creme foundation on there|`|oJ2U6Izlaa	There are creams and ointments to cure this.  You could also go to a spa and they have treatments for this.    here's a site with all the info.    http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Rid-of-Black-...|`|Kb0p6mcJaa	sleep more.  use a new kind of solution.  hold ice under eyes for 5 mins each morning.  & some foundation.|`|f57L7TKRaa	1. Place moist tea bags over your eyes for ten minutes. The caffeine in your standard black tea increases circulation and decreases dark circles.   2. Preparation H (I'm serious! It totally works. I used to use it when I did pageants.)  3. Buy a cheap eye cream at the drug store and chill it in your fridge before you apply. The coolness brings down swelling.|`|77FNePxFaa	Unfortunately dark circles will really never leave from underneath your eyes. Preparation H does not help with dark circles it helps with puffy eyes. Vitamin K will help a little as well as using Concealer.|`|1E0sjoqHaa	dab concealer over the circles and cover with powder|`|O0rpPItWaa	get more than 8-9 hours of sleep. eat and maintain a healthy diet. hope this works.|`|IHYSej5Raa	I was a swimmer and always wore eye make up--So I constantly rubbed underneath my eyes.  Now I have annoying bags too.  I use a shade lighter concealer than my powder and apply it underneath my eyes.  My sister is training to be a make up artist, and she says that green based make up works very well (as weird as that sounds).  Hope this helps!  Good luck!|`|AA11221923	seriously, what I'm about to say works.  I know that it's going to sound like a joke, but it really does work.      Preperation H  put it on before you go to bed    just don't get any IN your eyes b/c it hurts like hell|`|0atD75b8aa	What I would recommend is to wear some "Concealer"  You can get this product at any make up store.  1. Drugstores  2. Sephora  3. Any little places at the Bay  lIke: Estee Lauder, MAC, Nars...etc|`|z1yPORFGaa	home method that work for me is  ice-cubes and fresh green cucumber peels - put them separately under your eyes  first ice then cucumber.|`|7tnb4On2aa	Honestly?  I'm 50 and still have dark circles, in spite of various creams over the years that claim to treat or rid of them.   Some are ok, but you have to keep using them(I think they are tinted to cover the dark circles)on a regular basis.   I find this bothersome.    Dark circles are actually blood pooled in that area.  Some of us are more prone to them than others.      I just put concealer there now.    The creams are too much of a hassle, plus not the best moisturizers for the delicate eye area.      I once tried a vitamin k(vitamin k is the blood clotting vitamin)cream, and that didn't even work.      Honestly, we just have to learn to live with them and embrace them.|`|F5yFjbIpaa	I too suffer from this annoying problem,my dark circles are very very bad ,some days i look as if i actually have two black eyes ,i use physicians formula physicians strength concealer in soft yellow,it is awesome i have tried everything and this works very well,it is in a tube ,and it lasts all day!|`|7OKRI3dHaa	You can get cucumber or lemon slices under your eyes. thats all i got xD

L4mGoBb3aa	yes you should take it out!! sound like it might be infected. you should get it done by a professional.|`|MZWdvdEwaa	Shows how smart you are by letting your idiotic friend punch holes in your face for you.|`|fe992osaaa	you shouldnt have done it at all|`|IHYSej5Raa	To avoid some major pain in the next few weeks, I would take it out.  It sounds like its getting infected.  Just wait for a professional who knows what they are doing to pierce it.|`|eXMI11kkaa	see a piercer. if it's infected, don't take it out as it will trap the infection in without medicine. see a piercer to see if it's infected.|`|ua9zB4vTaa	Definitely take it out. And to clean it, use boiled water [let it cool!] mixed with a quarter teaspoon of salt. Take a cotton bud, dip it in the salt water, and hold it to the infected area for a few minutes twice a day. Try not to clean it more than that as it may get even more irritated. Don't get it pierced too soon again either, make sure it's completely healed, otherwise you'll be faced with the same problem again.    Good luck.
cUs60ETLaa	why in the world would he ever want his dick pierced..   why would you want his dick pierced?   like seriouslyy. thats sick!

z4y1O7nZaa	Geez, looks like we have a slew of UGG supporters.  I agree, they're comfy-- you don't have to do the UGGs though, you can get any fleecy boot (l have some from Minnetonka).  Also, Merrells make really comfy warm shoes.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	UGGS :) i live in them in the winter|`|FMcu6BNpaa	Ugg boots.

fDWaM4XCaa	Go onto a website and find their size chart. Just measure yourself and see.|`|bNphTSCiaa	i am a 0 or 2 in pants. and a 0 or 2 in dresses  so for me i am the same in pants and dresses  i guess it depends on your body shape.
ggia15Sbaa	Depends on the girl, but most girls look good with some curls in their hair since it adds more style and character.|`|hvjWpq2naa	Yes, they do, specially those girls that are ethnically black or usally curly haired.  (example, Beyonce Knowles). the only type that can carry off the curly bit are long haired french girls or irish. its a package deal. we are talking about woman that are trying for  supermodel type exposure?|`|JINK3IHiaa	Depends on the girl really, but most girls look good with like a wave going on.|`|XWdc2qk4aa	depends on the girl. we mainly notice how things work all together. no guy says things like, "she'd be hot if her hair had more curls"|`|kigMX323aa	im sorry i might be wasting your time by writing this because i am not a guy but id just like to add my 2 cents to this and i really would like to know what guys think i try to do my hair different every day but it is naturally super straight so that is easiest and i like wearing my hair like that.
b0YL0NcVaa	Alright, this is answer is coming from a curly headed 17 year  old(as yourself).      I have a history of dying my hair and frying it. Here is what to do.    1. Get Cholesterol hair conditioner- it's EXTREMELY affordable. Leave it in when you can, for as long as You can. I actually used to sleep with a shower cap on just so I could leave it in at night.  2. Can you get it cut? Cutting your hair helps a lot. I had a nightmare cut one time and couldn't cut it for a year. Big mistake. The more you cut it, the healthier it will look and feel.  3. Use a silicone based frizz agent. I use frizz ease. Sometimes I can just leave conditioner on, without the frizz ease, and gel it.     It's really good that you don't wash it all of the time. Try baby powdering your roots to soak up the oil on the third day. If it doesn't work, you can just wash it out.    I hope it works!|`|1o6bzLVbaa	try using 3 minute miracle from aussie. it's like conditioner.  http://well.ca/images/large/products/aus...|`|yVRpdx5laa	i have curly hair that i straighten and color too.  your doing good not overwashing it though. its not disgusting for those of you who don't know. it helps keep the natural oils in your hair and it redistributes and allows for moisture and less dryness.   i use tresemme shampoo/conditioner &&  garnier length/strength and sleek shine  i rotate every month. it helps keep moisture in my hair for some reason and adds to the shine.  i always add a little dab of my conditioner on the ends of my hair too and work it through the rest of my hair *its thick* but very little on the roots of my hair.  after i do that i use biosilk a little goes a long way. the serum really helps make my hair look glossy whether its straight or curly.  thats all the products i use because the more product you use the more it dries it out. also if you use a straightener try switching to a hair dryer and do it on a low setting. then touch up the areas that arent as straight as you want it. i understand it can be time consuming but try substituting it at least twice a week instead of every day straightening.   deep condition! :) i go to a salon and get it done and my hair feels so soft and smooth after. the curls get a lot more defined and theres no frizz.   hope i helped|`|6HgiNCmqaa	you can dye your hair but try other brands. maybe there is something in the dye making it dry?|`|LwCAph6Paa	try aussie shampoo and conditioner|`|RGSSYFPyaa	Try "Perfect 10"  it will smooth it out amazingly,  OR  my favourite that i ussse everyday ..  Loreal' studioline, hot straight. (heat protection)    TRY using, blonde expressions hair shampoo and conditioner  it will bring your colour out wayyyyy more  :)
0atD75b8aa	WOW!  I really liked you as the Blonde, it looks very flattering on you!|`|kUTALUQqaa	Definitely Blonde!|`|fDWaM4XCaa	I think blonde. I think light brown suited you the worst.|`|xqfbtYkHaa	Ur gorgeous! I like Lightish brown or blonde best :)|`|bhyVC2mtaa	blonde :)|`|MV0lMuDMaa	Chocolate Brown|`|XzksDeE3aa	O_O    Blonde for sure! You are very nice looking no matter what color though =)    (im not a pedo, im 15)|`|SQjJxaOqaa	blonde  most people cant pull of blonde  but you do beautifully|`|JN0TCcoraa	I think the light brown looks great! It's not too overwhelming (as the black was) or too fakey (as the blonde was). It brings out your skin tone and makes you that much more beautiful.|`|3QQla8BVaa	Blonde.|`|WuEcETAlaa	they all look really nice, but i think blonde is the best on you xx|`|wZDrrTBqaa	OMG u are so pretty like model pretty  u can pull off everything but my favourite is the second pic  ?|`|CF4K2dVAaa	Definitely blonde.   :)|`|czL2wo5Oaa	i think that light brown looks the best then chocolate brown  i dont like blonde that much|`|wqtwzzPeaa	Blonde, I'm guessing it's your natural hair color though.|`|UFfJDWONaa	blonde! the first pic of the blonde was amazing! the chocolate brown wasnt bad either, but i wouldnt recommend it over blonde :)|`|W0S7gQDaaa	I think you should stick with blonde because its a prettier color for you.|`|3omfTUQ0aa	like a red color|`|BgVtUdMjaa	Lightish brown makes you look like an earthy kid of girl  Blonde looked really good on you. It made you look like a girly kind of girl.  Chocolate brown looked good on you...  We cant really see your face with the black one but im guessing it looks really good with your blue eyes.    Overall i think you looked best in blonde|`|RwcTDenZaa	i like the black best. it's edgy.|`|d107a66f105e195f090c296ea6ac5b01aa	I think light brown and blonde looks the best. The black is okay, and it brings out your eyes but it doesn't really match your skin tone. So i'm really stuck inbetween light brown and blonde; i think i'm leaning more torwards light brown becuase blonde is too typical. Either blonde of light brown, you're really pretty.|`|nmzafTVFaa	light brown by far  it looked really natural
aKvxy3xBaa	Yes, the salon should have the products to straighten your hair. If they didn't they wouldn't have given you an appointment. You will just have to get use to having straight hair, it's different and you'll probably love it.|`|6RgghI66aa	It's your choice whether you want to go to a hair salon or not. The best advice I can give you is go to a hair salon that you can trust and they can provide great maintenance for your hair.     I learned that from different salons, different people put different things in my hair, and my hair may look like it's all that, but I realize the day I wash my may hair it's all crap that they're putting in my hair. After that my mother, my aunts, and I  just do my hair at home. There are good hair salons that I went to reccommended by my aunt and they're great. But you just need to know the people.     Not all hair salons are bad, just go to hair salons that you know you can trust and that they will do great for your hair. So if you want to do your hair at the salon...go for it girl, it might be a great experience. Good luck!! :)|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	I would go to a salon who is familiar with your hair, if not you could get in trouble. I would go to a hair salon where they knew how to do the best job possible on my hair type.|`|kUTALUQqaa	The hairdressers are professionals and know exactly how you want your hair, if you describe it to them properly. A good tip is NOT to go to a hairsalon that doesn't know good english. Even though they are professional hairdressers they wont understand you because you speak english to them very fast. They would know how to cut your hair properly in their country because everyone speaks that language (Arabic, Spanish, Farsi etc)|`|Cx7AYmDTaa	Your hair stylist is a professional. Talk to her for a little bit, if you feel comfortable with her handling your hair, go on with the appointment. If you have a stylist you know and love, go with them instead.|`|ke0dsgkkaa	You can and should talk with the stylist, let them know how you are feeling, your frights. What's their experience and all (not to question their ability), but they should understand the questioning, it's your hair. If you have doubts then go somewhere else. Best to you!

rD8iToGIaa	I've heard actors put panty liners under their arms, you could try that or it may be the material of the shirt.  Certain materials do that to me, ones that don't breathe as well as others or it could be a hormonal thing, you may grow out of it.  Also, don't shave every day.  I tend to be sweatier the days I shave and you shouldn't need to shave everyday especially in the winter.  You shouldn't be too embarressed to ask your mom, she's your mom!

Wear white shirts or black shirts. Those clinical deoderants i dont think work ive tried them and i ddnt like them.

Dont be afraid to ask your mom i was and i neva did and lived with it and it sucked!!!|`|vLF2uz9saa	well u shouldn't shave every day that's just plain stupid.

4UrUzpAHaa	Color Oops Extra Strength Hair Color remover.  They sell it at Walgreens.  Might want to give that a shot!|`|402001bd835df137698f75c2569b8406aa	As a cosmetolgist, we see this a lot in salons.  Box color is very tricky... this is because it is not formulated for your specific hair type- it's more of a one-size fits all.  Plus it's made from metallic-dyes and salts.  These are bad for your hair because they are very tricky to pull out of the hair if you want a new color.  Go back to the salon and have a professional color your hair... the reason why it is different colors from base to ends is becuase of porosity and new-growth... these all need to be taken into consideration when doing an all-over color.  Stylists have other options other than putting pre-lightener on your hair to lift the color... there are safter methods for pulling color out.

This is because your hair is made up of 97% protein and only 3% moisture(water).  Therefore, when your hair is very dry, and static is an issue- your hair is in need of protein.  You can buy deep conditioners to even use at home.  I recommend Sebastian Potion 9 Masque- and even getting the Sebastian Deep Shampoo and Conditioner will really make a difference.

It polishes hair for high-gloss shine and smoothes flyaways, fixes imperfections, and seals split ends.  So basically it will make any static problems go away while keeping your hair healthy, and it works on everyone.

yHWkQs9Paa	Don't feel bad about asking for help. If your parents and psychologist don't care (which is horrible if you ask me), then you need to go to someone else. You're not gonna be able to tackle this alone. Have someone, a friend or a teacher, who knows about the situation sit with you and help you during mealtimes. You're not gonna be able to stop right away, but if you work at it and have someone to help you, it'll happen eventually.|`|axheoEN4aa	Haha that sucks!

I don't know why you do this. Is it because you think you're overweight? I'f that's true, than this is the WRONG way to go. Food has energy in it and calories aren't necessarily a bad thing. If you eat something that is 200 calories (I know, a lot), then that doesn't mean it will automatically make you fat. Calories are the measure of energy inside of the food you eat. As long as you burn off that food before it is stored as fat, you won't become overweight.     Also, food is energy. The less you eat, or barf up, the less energy you have. You'll usually be tired, grumpy, and lazy. This will probably make you dizzy, too, from lack of food. And, most importantly, most of the water that we get for our bodies is from food. As you might already know, water makes up a large amount of your body. About 55% in a woman. 95% of the blood in your body is composed of water. All that I'm saying with these statistics is: you NEED food.     Good luck solving this problem and I wish the best for you!    -Jess :) :) :P|`|BE12KJZ3aa	editing|`|1ae530958d9d996d277ec8a9a5e5193faa	Tell your parents it's a real problem and have them get you help.

Obviously throwing up on this trip is not an option for you because you'll feel ashamed, so maybe these are your best bet. Take it slow, eat a little bit at a time without throwing up. Maybe smaller meals?    If you can't handle this, [and even if you can] then maybe it's time to talk to someone else. If your parents know, then the worst of it is behind you. Find an adult that you trust and let them know that you need, and want, help. If you've tried to stop and know you should, then you're halfway there. Just please get help before this becomes even more serious than it already is. Good luck.|`|85CeIpPvaa	Seriously, you need to get help and ask to be put in a hospital. If you dont you will get very sick . Your body will feed off your fat and you could die!!! You need to get help. Until then just try to eat and not throw up if they see it then just fake being sick or something.

I like Physician's Formula felt-tip black eyeliner pens, and Rimmel London's Special Eyes pencil liner in "black magic." Mascara... try LashBlast or Eyelights. Eyelights play up your eye colour. For foundation I use Cover Girl TRUBlend liquid foundation. It sort of blends in with your skin and looks very natural.|`|23Zz2yrPaa	Mascara:  Lashblast|`|rdB2Pbldaa	I have really thick hair, too! After I wash/condition my hair, I rinse my hair with really, really cold water, which makes it sleek and shiny. Then I put leave-in conditioner while it's still damp, then let it air-dry.    For easy breezy waves, I curl them with a large curling iron (about 1 1/2 inch), then brush through with my fingers while the curls are still warm. Just toss your head back and forth (pretend like you're in a shampoo commercial!) to give it that natural, breezy look. Good luck!|`|1FAakFh0aa	ok i have a different hair tyoe to you so i cant really answer but straight thick hair sounds good to me!!  thats like the ideal!      anyway im 19 and have tried so many makeups, like teh midprice stuff like loreal and maybellinne and more pricey things like mac and benefit and lancome, and only now do i have sorted what makeup i love!      ok maybelline foundation, superstay silky, it has  half primer and half foundation and comes out of teh pump together.    and maybelline mascara, the one with the white primer (again) onone end of the tube and the mascara on the other.      and eyeliner i think mac is the best, i think mac is good when you need pigmented makeup, like eyeshadows or eyeliner, when oyu want the colour to last!|`|EPMijsZ3aa	hey ya a good foundation is aqua smooth by covergirl i mix mine with a moisturizer but you can do what ever you want.a good mascara is loreal paris carbon black voluminous.last but not least a good eyeliner is covergirl cg smoothers eyeliner.      well i hope i helped if not sorry!!:)

w2Z1SV1Gaa	I've had luck with using Milk of Magnesia. I know, it's gross and sounds weird but it DOES work. You can buy a bottle from Wal-Mart for about $2 and it will last FOREVER. I shake the bottle up and then take the lid off of the bottle. Then I take a q-tip and rub it in the lid (since it has the MOM all over it and it's easier than sticking a little q-tip inside the whole bottle!  lol) and then dab the q-tip on the problem areas. Let it dry then rinse off. It will take about 3-4 applications (i.e. 3-4 days) for you see a noticeable difference but it DOES work. Just don't let it sit overnight otherwise your face will start peeling (the MOM works by drying up the oil under the skin which is what causes the pimples). This MOM treatment is safe, cheap and very effective. Good luck!  =)|`|vLF2uz9saa	maybe any netrogena products make sure u use a toner and a moisturizer.|`|jVsN7N6maa	I've found that applying a thin layer over my entire face, as the products usually suggest, doesn't work as well as applying a thicker layer to just the problem areas. That is, I don't use it as a preventative-- because it doesn't seem to work for that purpose-- I just use it to help any blemishes that have already came up go away faster. Actually, the benzoyl peroxide irritates your skin, so if you put it everwhere, you have to be extra careful about touching your face; if you just put in on some spots, you just have to avoid those. I think what really prevents new break outs is sticking to a washing and toning routine.    For washing, I use any plain, non-foaming, acne face wash. As long as it washes off without leaving any residue, and does a good job of leaving my skin oil-free (but not overly dry), I think it's a good product. To get the benefit of the medication (usually I use the benzoyl peroxide based ones) I leave it on for a minute or so before washing it off. But the main point of the washing is to clear your face and prepare it for the toner, which is what's actually going to help your skin repair itself.    For toning, what I use depends on the time of day. Have you tried vinegar and lemon juice? Squeeze a lemon into a cup of vinegar, and apply the mixture with a cotton ball and let it air dry. The smell is strong, but this definitely kills bacteria before it can worsen acne infections, so I use this at night before I go to bed. It also makes your skin smoother, but you have to apply it with a light touch, as it stings, especially on inflamed areas. In the mornings, I use witch hazel, or one of those toners that come with acne face wash, again applied with a cotton ball and left to air dry, then apply aloe vera gel to moisture my skin without leaving it feeling greasy. Aloe vera gel is the best moisturizer! If you can find the gel that contains vitamin e also, that's even better. After that dries, then I use a layer of benzoyl peroxide on any pimples or irritated bumps.    I don't like to put anything on my skin at night-- even aloe vera. Really, you should give your skin some time to rest and do its own thing uninterrupted at some point.    Weekly changes of your bedsheets and pillowcases, and showering before you go to bed (making sure you get your hair, too-- that's a big repository of oil) helps A LOT. I think the oils and gunk that builds up on you during the day get into the sheets and rubbed all over your face, otherwise. Whatever the reason, my break outs occur less often and are of less severity since I started doing this.|`|m9ay1tsEaa	You should use Neutrogena Skin ID it works better and faster then Proactive and is fit for you    Here is the quick to find out what your Skin ID is: http://www.skinid.com/econsumer/clearski...

Jh0yyYizaa	No no no,  what the hell are you thinking?  Do you know how bad tanning beds are for you?   Hello skin cancer!!     Even if you don't get skin cancer, when you're 30 years old, you'll start noticing dis-colored and leathery skin and wrinkles - therfor you will look 10+ years older than you are. Is that what you want to happen?   You may think tans are "hot" now, but in the future you will look back and wish you had never damaged your skin.     I can understand the disire to get a good tan 10 years ago when nobody knew the risk of tanning and nobody liked pale, but now since Pale is becoming the new fashion, theres no point damaging your skin for a tan.     Please be a little wiser and think about your future.   Whats more important, a tan now (that will last about 3 weeks) or leathery skin when you're older?   Your choice.|`|JGf3H3Ikaa	There are lots of studies that show tanning is very unhealthy, however relaxing it may be. Skin cancer has increased at least 20% in the last fifty years. A spray tanner can look just as good and would be healthier for you.|`|85CeIpPvaa	I do the whole tanning bed thing and I love it!!! its so relaxing and the ladies will help you with your skin tone and start you off at the right amount of time and work your way up to the full amount of time!

9vLJbiHeaa	Guurl, your 14 and wanting to look older and im 16 and wanting to look younger wana swap? hahaha joking  ok well dont wear too much makeup, wearing alot of make up makes people think your not mature enough to tell what looks good.  go to your nearby mall and go to a makeup stall and ask the counter girl what foundation / cover up will cover you scars. use light brown eyeshadow, mascara and a little eye liner if not no eye liner.  for you hair you should probable make it into layers if you want it straight or leave it the lenght but curl the end to give it a nice bouncy look ( liek seirina from gossip girl) cant spell sorry  good luck with this its gona take a wile to find what suites you and makes you feel liek yourself  --- x ---|`|x3NIn6rSaa	awwww...I'm sorry.

Being yourself is the most gorgeous thing you could be. Don't change for other people, it's their loss if they don't like you for who you are.     Don't worry about never having a boyfriend or never had your first kiss - all that happened for me at 17, and I don't think that's old for those special events.     Remember, you may think other girls your age are happy with themselves but I bet every single one judges themselves and compares themselves to you and other girls too.     If you want to change a little, buy some new clothes and accessories. A new shirt, shoes, or even some nice new socks or undies. Buy some cute clips or earrings.   When I want some choice to a new haircut, I buy one or two hair magazines and get ideas from them.     Hope i've helped.|`|3VizNJV8aa	Well, like 10 people think I'm hot but I honestly don't understand why.  I use liquid foundation to cover up acne and it mostly works.  Never pop your pimples because it leaves major scars!  Know one thing, you don't have to be mature to be pretty, and being pretty doesn't always get you friends.  So don't go too heavy on the make-up or they'll know you're trying hard, which isn't very good.  By the age of 14 you don't always have to have had your first kiss or even a boyfriend.  It's not that important, what's important is to be yourself and have fun, a guy will eventually like you!  And you don't have to be confident if you're pretty.  I have absolutely gorgeous friends and they all act like 2nd graders!  About your hair, if it needs some body, get a wavy perm.  You could also try some light touches of highlights in it, that's what I did recently and lots of people complimented it.  If you get lighter colors of highlights then it brings out some of your hidden maybe, darker brown, natural colors in you hair.  Like my hair is brown, and I recently got a caramel color in my hair, and now i have a few natural red streaks in my hair.  I love it.|`|BLOcQtCTaa	having a nice smile, being smart , and being confident.|`|a509bf79e80b35be114f3270cce0b89daa	I know you want to be beautiful, but it really sounds like your really rushing to grow up.    =p    If you want to look "prettier" just wear mineral powder makeup this will help cover up scars.  And make sure you wash your face! Everyday!    These scars can fade over time, won't go away fast though.  Go to your hairstylist and ask her on some ideas on how to do your hair.     Take things one step at a time, Don't rush into buying a lot of makeup and stuff.

And you're only in 8th grade, so never being kissed or having a boyfriend isn't really that big of a deal. Try to act confident in your own self, the way you are now. Sure, you can cut your hair, and wear make up, but its not going to instantly make you popular and beautiful and get you lots of boyfriends. The best way to be beautiful is to be truly beautiful on the inside, because inner beauty will always shine through.|`|IBkTXqQEaa	Make up makes A LOT of little slutty girls look 'gorgeous' =]  believe me, when i wore make up, i looked really older, and attractive still am ;], Oh and if you have light skin then maby dye your hair blonde?

Because Blush (peachy or light pink) looks great on fair skin with dark hair (and will defiantly make you look gorgeous).   If you have darker skin, then a darker blush would make you look nice too. Wear a bit of mascara and on top lash line eyeliner. It looks natural yet pretty. A bit of gold or blue eyeshadow is pretty too.   With your hair, either leave it out, put it half up-half down or put it in a messy bun with a ribbon.   Putting your hair in two plaits can make you look very pretty as well.     Use a tinted moisturizer for a natural look.     Also, you've never been kissed and had a boyfriend - don't worry about boys at this age, theres plenty of them in the future. I know I probably sound like your mother but Its actually the truth. Boys are everywhere and they will ALWAYS be around, so don't stress. And anyway, how would you feel if you went out with a really awesome guy and he broke up with you? (And it would happen sooner or later).. You'd be heartbroken and would it really be worth it?    Hunny, I'm 15 and haven't been kissed before! But I'm not upset, I'm happy with my life. And I do know that guys have and do like me, so its not a big deal.   Enjoy life with friends and family and the guys can wait!

Shop at designers.|`|b21d93151e888db9c764fbd4e5135eb1aa	perfectly good reason to want to look gorgeous!   but remember those girls who wear makeup and get the guys usually have things their way because inside they feel more confident in their looks; not always because they look better.   i have medium length straight black hair too! i wouldn't recommend a perm because if they mess it up it's really hard to fix and touchups are difficult, i'd recommend some nice long layers and wispy side bangs.   a bit of maybelline's mineral power concealer for your acne scars. oh and may i recommend clean and clear's acne spot treatment?   a tinted moisturizer like covergirl's aquasmoothers with SPF 15 would also help protect and even out your skin.   a touch of dark brown or black mascara and/or eyeliner would bring out your eyes   and a bit of clear lip gloss/lip balm to pull your look together   tell me how you like it :)   hope this helps   and good luck!|`|Mkroj9gPaa	enjoy your youth. who cares what everyone else looks like. be yourself. if youre looking for guys, the right one will find YOU. plus, guys hate girls that wear make up. if you really have to wear make up, i'd just go for mascara. it work wonders. dont try to cover your acne or scars cause its always noticeable and you'll have a cakie face. i think you should straighten your hair or make i wavy by putting braids in at night and then undoing them in the morning. but please, dont rush to grow up. and dont waste all your time one caring what others think. it messes with your head. trust me, i know.|`|adEdGXnsaa	oh goodness..  please enjoy these years as long as you can! that's how i was my 8th grade year and i regret it...i'm already a senior in high school and going to college in august and it all goes by just so fast...so don't rush anything! :)    you shouldn't really wear eyeshadow or lipstick or foundation or not even eyeliner....  all i wore in middle school was mascara :]    try getting layers in your hair? or maybe cutting it short for a whole new look?|`|vZuzT3cTaa	first of all dont make yourself beautiful for others just yourself. if u change who you are then you will be left confused in the end. my suggestion would be try curling your hair, and giving it bounce. wash your face every night before you go to bed i use noxema triple clean. it gets rid of oil, blackheads and just makes u feel fresh! i have been using it since i was about 16 and now im 21, and i have had maybe 5 pimples since i started using it! another thing is make-up. guys like the more natural look. masquera, is always good, make sure it has lots of volume!!!! with a light color towards the inner eye and make it a little darker as you reach the outer eye part. i use eyeliner underneath my eyes, it makes them pop out more, so you could try that. i also wanted to tell you, if u dont like your hair curly, and you want a big change, wash your hair, then while its wet put moose on it, braide it then put a hair thing on the end and then sleep with it. when you make up take the braides out and your hair will be crimped. now your hair will look fluffy. so then what i do is take the top and put it half up half down, but more down then up. you will look great!!!! i get compliments all the time:) but make sure you do it in steps  1- wet hair before bed  2- take a medium amount of hair and put moose on it from top 2 bottom  3- braide it  4- put a hair thing in so it doesnt fall out  5- make sure you do this all over your head, unless you want to first try it with a couple pieces, i usually do about 20-25 braides.  6- wake up and take out all braides  7- then put your hair half up and half down.      and thast it. if you want style tips go to tyra banks.com  shes awesome! good luck tell me how it looks!|`|hgIiF3sdaa	Well, for one thing, i'm 16, and like you, in every way, except the hair, but you don't need make-up and all that to be mature, and beautiful.    I wear barely any make up, because i feel its mostly a waste of time, i only wear foundation and mascara, and i straighten my hair, so its not so frizzy, :D     If you wear tonnes of make up like the other 14 year old girls, you'll look like a walking barbie doll, and you'll just be following the crowd like everyone else, you should just be you, and be individual.

IbX7hzH7aa	Before reading ur question that was my instant thought.    You should ask someone who works in the makeup section.    Some people look good in warm colors because of their warm complexions versus cool tones.    I dont know  if you are into make up stores like Macy's or Sephora. Ask a professional.     Go shopping with a friend who loves to shop or someone who u think looks great with makeup and ask her advice.|`|C5Wlt3rGaa	Actually, it's according to skin color rather than lip color.

qmORT5ISaa	like i've told many people when they're not sure of their piercings.  think of how that area of your skin would look like without the piercing..  now, if you're really serious and really wanna  get it done then you should really take care of it.  the piercing itself doesn't hurt, but the healing process can be a bit annoying (as any other piercing)   personally though, i love my belly ring =D i have a cute little barbell with a little sparkly thing on it...so i don't look like a x-mas tree but still feminine at the same time|`|a3602d85b598b4d25e4051a959507dedaa	personally i like them.    my professor taught something on this, get a titanium one    most people are allergic to the steel|`|1bwLBV2aaa	pros--cute, fun for the summer, buying new barbells :), doesn't hurt at all to get pierced, heals fast with right treatment.    cons--it can take a while to heal, if not taken care of properly.|`|kCghGbopaa	I personaly dont think you should get it.  One, you will regret it.  Two, I hurts, and three  it kindof ugly......|`|md5gjv3qaa	go  4 it!!   u will have a place to hang ur keys|`|DZkkYK0Baa	I've never had a naval piercing but my aunt did...Here's what I know...    Pros: Can be very cute/attractive (that's a matter of opinion) and fun.    Cons: (I think) they are a surface piercing and have a higher rate of rejection, and, like any piercing, they require money and care. This specific piercing can snag on clothing (and possibly rip).     Don't think that just because there are more cons than pros means that you should not get the piercing. I love piercings and body mods. I think they're a lot of fun. Just be sure to have a professional do it or be VERY safe and cautious if you plan on doing it yourself.|`|r2QIbmPIaa	alrighty well i got mine done about 2 months ago and i love it. im 14 and some people say im too young to get them but its my body. theyre really cute, it doesnt hurt as bad as you think it does... its a tolerated pain(like getting a shot it, the pain lasts 5 seconds) looks really cute in the summer! doesnt show through shirts. theres not much cons with it. It doesnt get infected unless your really unresponisble and neglect to clean it everyday. it does take a while to heal but i wouldnt know the difference if it was healed or not. it doesnt hurt besides the first 2 days.  lets just say theyre not tacky, theyre cute and you should get one :]  trust me, i love mine!|`|mKDSnQO5aa	Tacky! It makes you look kind of slutty. The second I see someone with a belly ring i just think slut. Unfortunately first impressions matter:(
DZkkYK0Baa	As said, do not use rubbing alcohol. Your piercer should have told you that you're supposed to use sea salt. I have two top lip piercings, which I got last year, and this is what I did:    I bought a can thingy of sea salt from some grocery store (it's fairly cheap) and put tap water in a cup and microwaved it to make it warm (kind of hot, really, but definitely a tolerable temperature) and added some sea salt (I don't know the exact measurements so I put quite a lot in that little cup of water, like two spoonfuls, which I'm sure is more than enough, but I don't think you can over do it) then stirred it 'till it dissolved. Then I got a clean washcloth and dipped it in the solution and held it to my piercing gently. You can also use q-tips (though, the cotton fibers might snag on the jewelry, so be careful) and dip that in the solution and rub it around the piercing.     I also used mouthwash, though I'm not sure you're supposed to. I only did it a couple of times a week. My piercings healed well. No more rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide!|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Because you're using rubbing alcohol. It's terrible for fresh piercings, as it's really harsh and will destroy the healing cells.    Please read this for proper aftercare instructions:  http://www.articlefit.com/Piercing-After...|`|pGF6Xdghaa	alcohol stings, especially when you get a cut... that's why it stings..  because you just got your lip pierced...  i am pretty sure it's normal: )|`|7aqcathsaa	It's because you punctured your skin, and there's raw flesh being exposed. The rubbing alcohol kills the germs (and maybe even good bacteria), and that's what's hurting. I'm guessing that it's normal, but if it looks a bit red, then it's probably infected. Ask the person who pierced it, or ask someone at a piercing salon if you did it yourself.|`|a7eE92RPaa	Ditch the alcohol. Go for saltwater soaks. Be sure to have a new toothbrush. Don't use the one you had prior to your piercing, otherwise more bacteria.|`|plpCtejoaa	Both times I had mine pierced. I was told to use salt water solution or diluted listerine to swish with. As for the outside they told me to wash with antibacterial soap and rinse really well. Rotate the piercing to keep it loose and from caking up any crust. Mine both healed perfectly, no pain after the first two days.     Good luck.|`|4nRscsX0aa	DO NOT USE RUBBING ALCOHOL ON ANY PIERCING! Clean your piercing with an antibacterial soap (such as dial soap)  3-5 times daily. Turning the jewelry as you clean to ensure the piercing is washed and turn the jewelry as you rinse it. Also you may want to swish a listerine solution (half listering half water) inside your mouth 3-5 times daily for the first two weeks. ^.^  Hope this helps.

I think that is a very feminine area and would look best un-tattooed.  Dont get me wrong I love tats though :p  I think it might look weird if you just have one on your shoulder blade and one in the middle but it would look fine if you everutally got another one on your other shoulder blade to kind of balance it out.

W9B6EJrWaa	You should really make your own:  Go deep into the woods and look for a beehive.  Brushing aside all those pesky bees, dip your hands deep into their hive, and break off as many hunks of wax as you possibly can.  When you return to your home, heat them on the stove, on the very highest temperature.  When the wax is nice and bubbly, dip your whole head into the wax, coating it nicely.  When the wax hardens, take a razor blade and cut through the layers of wax, pressing as hard as you can, cutting around your lips.  Now lift and peel the wax off everywhere except your lips.     See?  Homemade lip balm!

Hope this helps :)|`|A0tWlG94aa	no you should never do that  just use a good cleanser and eat healthily|`|b909a840d0e0744216e0c1754132f74daa	You should never exfoliate more than twice a week. I'd actually try a moisturizer. You may be having all that dead skin because your skin is dehydrated. Is it flaky when it's dry?|`|3JkZPMvYaa	you could do that but only one time a day i suggest you use clean and clear morning burst  FACIAL SCRUB it says its good for every day use but then follow with the same brand of moisturizer
ZnyRwInIaa	Neutrogena makes a serum in a lip balm type of tube that works okay. You will mostly have to fake it. Try rimmel lip plumping products. They are located right in their cosmetic section. The gloss really made my lips look bigger and it also has collagen in the product which will enhance them literally.Buy a lotion with collagen and apply to your lips every morning, and then try the gloss afterward.|`|st5reHVjaa	besides botox?  if u get a lip gloss and some of it is a LITTLE over the edge of ur lips the light'll reflect on it and make it look bigger. but thats only with gloss. if u do it with lip stick it'll look ugly|`|a6hQftotaa	A lip plumper and botox.|`|coC1Mu4eaa	Genetics, Lip Gloss , Sore Lips, and Lip injections.|`|e1FnEHRpaa	lip plumper. Not a big fan of it myself because it kind of burns but it does the trick : ]|`|4C7hSzWCaa	Put a tad bit of lip gloss just on your bottom lip in the center and it makes your lips appear to be fuller. Or you could apply peppermint oil on your lips, I heard it makes them fuller as well. I use a volumizing lip plumper I got from the drugstore for like $8 and I love it! I think the brand is Maybelline.|`|ON8f96Egaa	In the morning, my friend Amy wets her lips, then rubs cinnamon into the lips and then wipes it off a few minuets later when it all dries or until she is ready to leave the house. Its worth a shot. and hers lips are beautiful.
mzNLfY4Caa	Okay. I'll tell you from my point of view...  I am an artist and I see beauty through energy. For example I have seen this girl at school who is chubby, light skinned, with curly hair. The majority of people wouldn't consider this girl to be attractive at all, but when I look at her, I see a very rare and exceptional beauty. She looks like a calm girl, and I am at peace when I look at her face. It might sound creepy but I was just sketching her one day, and I was just mesmerized to how beautiful she was. That is just me and my opinion though. I don't think the standard "barbie" look is the most beautiful, I think it really depends on other people, and that might let you know that people might just not click with you. You should always just focus on the people who care about you, and just love you for who you are. You will come across different opinions for the rest of your life, but if you learn to accept your beauty, and learn to accept yourself, you will have no problem.|`|ebQ4vuUnaa	Beauty is in the eye of the beer holder err beholder    Everyone finds different things attractive, be grateful for the ones that say you are gorgeous.    The whole world is not going to agree that one person is beautiful, we all have our own likes and dislikes.    Best of Luck!    Cinn =)|`|gYyW39wTaa	Beauty is in the eye of beholder|`|MbFS6XFQaa	Ok...why bother asking if you ain't gonna post pics?|`|XLRx5decaa	Because people have different opinions on beauty. Also, if someone says you're not their type, that means you're "okay."|`|b43c053e3ac43caf8628f3280701c547aa	People like average beauty    Your beauty is beautiful beauty so it may not appeal to everyone. But to those who you appeal you will grab them like what Helen of Troy did who launced 1,000 ships.    Average beauty go figure I don't know why people would prefer averageness. Maybe it is safe?|`|0azvQnhyaa	to a guy a girl is usually very pretty unless they are obviously ugly, everyone is different. I'm sure you are pretty and gorgeous because many people have told you that, the guys who say aren't' your type mean that it has nothing to do with your looks, they  probably think your beautiful but type means personality.    you, see if a hot guy was surrounded by 100 hot girls and 99 of them were shallow and mean, he would probably turn them down, if 1 of those girls was humble and nice and funny then he would probably choose her. So a girl can be very pretty but the guy could see her as ugly from the way she acts around him or other people.    now, I'm not saying you are a shallow rich girl, but in their eyes you could just not be the type of girl they are looking for, i mean maybe they have already dated someone like you before and they had a bad experience and they figured "eh I'm not going back there again." So technically this isn't   about your looks at all its about the person inside you.|`|mYTogRrXaa	Weeellll  People just have different taste.  ITs as simple as that.  Like say, I don't like fish.

You seem "exotic" because of your japanese ethnicity. Some people don't like different nationalities and some do. you are definatley more exotic than me.

And I have very fair skin (Irish) and very dark hair (native American) so.. either way. Having confidence will make you pretty to just about anyone. If you think your pretty, that's all that matters!!|`|P5Yh0poBaa	if you look like catherine zeta jones then you must be a babe.|`|c4ZkcK6waa	Nobody is perfect. Its the way the eye and mind works. To me you are just ok. Maybe its because ur trying to hard.|`|0NGv4Vtyaa	Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.    It's probably not you. It's just the guy. He might just be looking to get into your pants or you're really pretty. He also might just be really nice or you're not so pretty. Who really knows. I think that you should believe that you're pretty no matter what people say and if they don't want to date you than they're missing out.|`|QzzhssWYaa	people think diffrent.|`|ySkF6Jidaa	Yea I do think it's because you are exotic. Some guys like girls that are a bit different looking and have something unique/special about them, whilst other guys just like the conventionally looking girl. I think you should feel lucky that you are one of those people that stand out, maybe not to everyone, but there are people out there that appreciate a special kind of beauty that isn't that common.|`|0H8prIJCaa	Hello stranger,    It all comes down to preference. I don't find Paris Hilton attractive at all (but I'm quite shallow so I'm sure if she knocked on my door tomorrow I wouldn't say no!).    Some guys are choosy and only go for blondes. I think ethnicity plays a small role in attraction too, you say your half Japanese then maybe guys find that intimidating because they are only used being with Caucasian or African American women etc. Personally I believe that it's 60% looks and 40% personality that determines how attractive you are. Some guys only go for women who are outgoing and sociable or funny and knowledgeable or quiet and shy. I was with my ex girlfriend for 2 years and one day I shaved my head for no reason and for a good month she didn't want to look at me because she hates guys with shaved heads so much!!! This proves that she wouldn't have gone out with me in the first place if I had a shaved head so you see how particular some people can be over attraction!!    My answer is that if you look similar to the photo provided then you ARE hot and shouldn't be told otherwise. Some guys might be telling you that your not there type because they find your good looks intimidating -a sort of reverse psychology thing- trying to make you feel like your not good enough for them when really your TOO good for them!

There is also a 100% guarantee if for some reason it doesn't work, oh yeah there was no pain involved with any of my moles|`|JJylMVqXaa	Use DermaTend! Definitely    www.dermatend.com    I had a mole removed surgically on my back and have a large scar now due to it. (5 years later it's still there)    I used dermatend on some moles on my neck and it worked great!    Only a tiny mark  and that's because I knocked the scab off accidentally with my towel when drying my hair!

qHGcXRpgaa	i find that im not in control if i date a taller girl so yeah, i get put off my tall women because people generlise height with power and control.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	I've seen some tall women who were exceptionally desirable.  Geena Davis comes to mind.  She's about 6'3", and she was nuclear hot back in the late Eighties.  I haven't seen her in any movies lately though.     And let us not forget Princess Diana.  I think she was about 5'10", and supremely glamorous..  Unfortunately, most tall women I've seen in person are built like NFL linebackers.  That's a fact of life.    And let's face it, most men I know would be intimidated by a woman who looks like she can slam-dunk over LeBron James.|`|6ybAFZuAaa	no definitely not!!! all the models and actresses are tall. and also, when short girls are older theylll be fat and we'll be slim XD|`|OcHJtS2Naa	Actually, a lot of guys do.

Idk.|`|972LCOk4aa	guys have different preferences  some prefer shorter than them, some prefer taller than them and some prefer around the same height  i think tall girls are sexy lmfao even though im not a guy  i'm also pretty tall and i have no problem finding a bf  its just that MOST guys(not all), prefer girls shorter than them but dont let that get to you, there are alota guys out there that like tall girls xD|`|eJ3K8ljyaa	i hope not, cause if so im going to end up being a bag lady that sits on benches in parks feeding pigeons.|`|ZTVmUb4Laa	To be honest I think women are more likely to be turned off by a shorter man than the other way around. Men who like legs tend to like taller women...|`|MQAye9eEaa	no TALL GIRLS ARE SEXY!!! Short girls are a turn-off.|`|iEjCmMMPaa	I think boys just don't want to compete in height. They want to be taller than the girls they date and don't want to be embarrassed to have to look up to her. also many guys won't grow fully until after high school|`|A9ZJKa7Haa	Out of all the guys I know, yes. Look it up on google "Guys prefer short girls or tall girls" you'll see that shorties are more popular. :)|`|69xEpBriaa	I don't think most guys prefer short girls to tall ones. Being tall seems to be an attractive attribute in both sexes. I am sure that girls tend to like taller guys and maybe that's one reason why guys tend to go with shorter girls. That is, it's kinda hard to get a taller girl.   I may be wrong but this is what I thought when I read your question.|`|drj8Z367aa	awwww man i'm 5'2 guess i'm screwed|`|rKz5rBJ6aa	sory but yes, me being a 6'1 girl, i kno, sad rite! well just find a tall guy or convince him to wear heels lol!|`|QzzhssWYaa	i think guys like girls that are shorter then them.|`|clsqhJwWaa	definately not.im really close to this one very attractive 34 year old that looks 25 or so. and he loves tall women!hes only 5'7.|`|1FAakFh0aa	its not that guys prefer one or teh otehr.    guys just want to be the taller one.  and girls will want to be the shorter than the guy they are with.    its called sexual dimorphism!     if you are having trouble now, oyur prob young, when those guys have grown up they will be cool with it, they will be taller. girls get their growth spurt earlier than guys so during teenage years its not uncommon for girls to be taller for a while, but the guys should catch up and pass them out.      im 5'10, and used to be taller than alot of guys i knew, now im 19 and all those guys are now like 6' 3/ 6'4...you know, tall!    and its not an issue anymore.    sorry if im waffling, but basically, girls are smaller than guys. thats the way we want it to look cause other wise it would seem odd. dont worry, their are plenty of tall men out there.    height is a good thing.    all the victorias secret models are tall....do you think tehy would be a turn off to any man in the world? no!
97p19rjxaa	I strongly advise you against getting a tattoo in a language you have never studied, even if you get the help of experts. There may be subtleties of meaning you do not understand, or the translation may not capture the meaning you are looking for. Also, there are many ways to translate even a simple phrase or sentence. You may ask a dozen Latin professors and still end up with multiple variations. Finally, any of us are capable of making a mistake or typo, which will then become permanent on your body. Without understanding the language you will be unprepared to distinguish between the variations and/or errors that you receive. Proceed at your own risk.    I agree with the sentences that dollhaus gave you except that in both cases I would make valens and fortis accusative (two accusatives with verbs of naming, making, etc.). I suggest replacing them with 'valentem' and 'fortem' respectively. But then again, I'm pretty rusty so I reiterate my admonition against tattoos in foreign languages that you don't know.|`|BQ8FuBo9aa	freetranslation.com|`|C9xguzBXaa	OKJAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY... LOOK IT UP1|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	I have no idea unfortunately - it's been almost a decade since I studied Latin! :-( However I just wanted to say that I wouldn't rely on people on the internet for this. Particularly as you are unlikely to find any fluent Latin speakers. Not worth taking the risk of some joker coming on and spurting a bit of bollocks for a 'laugh' and end up getting the wrong phrase inked. I would recommend you find a local school or university that has a Latin department, and forward an email to a Latin tutor there asking very nicely for a translation, hopefully someone will be kind enough to take a couple of minutes out of their day to help you out! In fact I would email a few different places, just on the off chance one got it slightly wrong, I'd go with the majority!|`|84a92b794a6ae292684ad41ae82b80b4aa	10 points please. My tattoos are of JESUS wearing a crown   of thorns. With blood running down HIS face..  Praying hands with moms ( RIP ) rosary beads and cross   trailing down my forearm ending with cross on my hand .   Please NO words !!!!!!!!   Use GODS image some way looking down upon you .   No translation is needed .... This tat is about you and the FATHER.   You are strong and valiant >> Show it in a picture not  words|`|a8c7dd05335ffea47dbc2766a29af9d7aa	I'm taking Latin now and I know that Father is Noster.  What you had for the last part looks right, just take out the first "et" so it can be "strong and valiant." And remember that the verb in Latin comes last in a sentence usually so you should put the verb last ;D Virtus should be virto so that its a direct object. fortis is a different conjugation but i think it is fortem. :)|`|IgLCInDQaa	abbas planto mihi utriusque validus quod fortis|`|bMhLdnsbaa	Abbas , planto mihi utriusque validus quod fortis

DZkkYK0Baa	Well, I actually have kind of red/pink skin in the face as well. I used to not wash my face at night but once I started to, it seemed to help my skin a lot. Remove all makeup at night (baby oil, baby wipes, or baby shampoo are safe, cheap, and common for this) and wash your face with a good acne wash then apply lotion or some other kind of moisturizer once or twice (your skin will absorb this very fast after washing).     Also, my father has rosacea (his skin is very red - his nose is actually kind of purple because of it) and he uses this moisturizer called Aquaphilic on his face to help it. You could try that. I think it's like $8 a jar (which lasts forever) around here. He might use something else, but, if he does, I don't know of it.|`|bLahP9Ivaa	Go see a dermatologist, this sound like acne rosacea.|`|872fcc76954a83920779a9df510b118baa	you can try some of my soap that i made it's all natural.  :)|`|C9xguzBXaa	COOL?

So what you do is you for night time before you go to sleep  1. Wash your face with water  2. Only 1 pump on to your hand and gently rub in circles around your whole face.  3. Wash face  4. With a towel, pat your skin lightly and just leave some a little damp.  5. Put on some "non scented" lotion all over your face    In the morning repeat every step agian!  And keep doing this routine everyday and you will see your skin birghter, clear, and nicer.  I guarentee that you will feel better with your skin. =)|`|3JkZPMvYaa	you should probably use an all natural homemade facial     use cooked oatmeal an egg and a tiny bit of olive oil rub it on your face then leave it on  for 10-15 min then wash off i suggest doin it in the bathroom coz it gets messy and do it before you take a shower the oatmeal should soothe your skin but dont use hot water to wash it off because hot water takes out moisture.. after you should use a thin layer of a lite moisturizer|`|6d366995788df4d6f45713e15e220860aa	Aveeno.

Its amazing.|`|8YfSjmYTaa	don't worry it's normal to have those without consulting your dermatologist. i suggest to you to practice the "water therapy" treatment. first thing you do is when you get out of bed, wash your face with water. then dry it with a soft towel.don't rub just dry it. do this again before you sleep or as much as possible. eating fruits and drinking juices reduces the oil in your face and also by drinking water.it is a safer way than to take cleansers.|`|AA10077147	I agree somewhat with brittney m, but only if it becomes more severe. I had the exact same thing happen to me when I tried PROACTIVE!!! I bought it three times thinking that maybe I just hadn't given it enough time. IT SUCKS! Completely dried out my skin making it more irritated which in turn meant more breakouts! I went to a dermatologist. He perscribed DIFFERIN, BENZCLIN, and DORYX. My skin is so smooth now it's not even funny. I only used doryx for a couple of months because it is a very strong pill, but it gave me lasting results. Now I don't even need any prescriptions. I use CETAPHIL face wash. It's ph balanced for sensitive skin & my dermatologist recommended it. I use a couple of organic toners to keep my skin in check now. The first one is just USDA certified organic green tea that has been chilled. I use this one in the morning under some CETAPHIL spf 15 lotion and it's very refreshing. The other toner is just one part apple cider vinegar to eight parts purified water. They are both full of antioxidants & the vinegar has a lot of alpha hydroxy acids which help quite a bit. You can also use the apple cider vinegar as a spot treatment without mixing it with water. Also, make sure that anything you put on your face says "oil-free, non-comodogenic, non-irritating, or/and fragrance-free"    Good luck! Hope this helps.|`|W3uE4VVxaa	you probably want to see your doctor if that is the case.|`|vZuzT3cTaa	try noxema triple clean. use it when u go to bed. dont over do it. i have used this since i was 16 and now im 21, i have had less then 10 pimples since then. like u im allergic to alot of cleansers. this works the best and its like 4 dollars.

sZUNC9Ghaa	wear a purple or yellow hoodie. that would be cute. a green or blue would be going to far, a red would pop way too much, an orange would pop alot too(pop in a bad way)  so u should wear a purple or yellow one. preferrably neonish purple. or bright yellow. it can have some designs but not to many, or a rainbow hoodie would be awesome too  or animal print such as zebra|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	any colour looks good with jeans.  but with light jeans i say a darker shirt or a bright coloured shirt.|`|l9havFTaaa	A light color would be good|`|9Qi7L1WWaa	purple green and black|`|oSDppSwVaa	likke they are ligght?  i think maybe a dark blue, or red. i like wearring every color with light jeans. i sometimes wear like a yelllow shirt with a jacket over it and then some nice neckalces.    but if they dont have the string acroos them anymore, like if theyre just big holes then i would just wearing like a plain tee-shirt.something pink or orange.|`|JIDrQPE5aa	you want to go with  drk color since they are  light color jean. but dont wear anything that matches your hair or skin tone. like if your really light skinned then dont wer white or yellow, light blue or pink. if your dark skinned than stay away from tan or brown|`|3dHn4gQraa	i say either a plaid top in really any color  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...    or an oversized tee in a lighter color such as grey or white  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...|`|PQv034s8aa	colorful tanks and tees would be super cute, even with one of ur hoodies!|`|y1gsXEwOaa	any color im sure but the color of the jeans lol  glad i could help! :]]|`|Ug59D75laa	Everyone has there own opinion, so try on some of them and decide which looks best. ;D|`|CuhJRewLaa	pretty much any dark color

AA10297143	You can take any computer design, so work with that if possible.  Otherwise, check with the tattoo artist who you expect to do the work and see what she/he has to offer.  I am not a tattoo kind of person, so not much to offer by way of names or designs, however, I have seen many names and sometimes dates encased within a heart and wreaths.  Luckily for you it is only two, but if you have more (maybe, possibly?) then you might want something that can be built upon.  A circle chasing the names/dates might be possible also.
HS5ZSdd0aa	Mine is a good 6-8 inches long and 3-4 wide so it is significantly larger than what you are talking about.  What really depends on is:   1 the placement of the tattoo on the shoulder blade and   2 how big you are, a 2x2 on someone 5'2" is going look much larger and someone who is 6" 2   3 the tank top, because every tank top has straps in different places.    You will most like get partial coverage and why cover it up all the way?  I got mine for everyone to see (yet still cover when I need to dress for work)|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	Um....partially

85KL0eUUaa	*sigh*  60-85 kilos?  60kg at that height would be chubby, 85 would be morbidly obese.  and 140? That's almost overweight.    Now, your ideal weight is 120lb. (100lb for 5 feet, plus 5lb for every inch after that. if you have a small frame, subtract 10%. if it is large, add 10%)    To be skinny-but-healthy, the lowest you could go is 108lb. (it puts your BMI at 18.5)  So that would be what you would want to weigh.  And if you have a small frame, that's what you should weigh anyway.  If your frame is large, do not go lower than 120.|`|yqKi9l9laa	130|`|mQhYZk2eaa	115|`|SCTMtrjhaa	125-135|`|ardSb3jlaa	i would say under 130|`|PHYJcSrpaa	I predict about 60kilos to 85kilos.Some weight around that.

RsDAGnBhaa	Um to get rid of flaky skin, after showering, or while showering rub that area so the dead skin comes off (basically exfolliating) but since you're doing it with your finger pads it doesn't rip your skin or anything.

Df8wTpEKaa	Let your hair grow out a little bit, then go to a salon and have them try to match up a color with the color of your roots. This happened to me too, but I just ended up going a few shades darker than my natural hair color then the more I washed it, it lightened up. :)|`|w1pbRmazaa	Find a hair dye closest to your old hair color and dye it back, then just let it grow out.|`|AA12075153	I'd be happy just to have my hair back!|`|sOlGuPDhaa	idk like a reddish brown right??? well datz wut i tinkkk...|`|pY9Gc3GGaa	hmm well i dyed my hair black too and depending on the kind of dye you used it will eventually fade.   unfortunately hair dye is impossible to wash out all the way, i wouldnt recomend dying your hair again, it might damage it or make it  look wierd.  my advice is look for a strong shampoo and it might start to wash out a little faster.  good luck
AA11455227	Well I just stretched to a 2 from a 10 and it is wierd walking around with a taper in your ear(Iv never had it in more than 10 minutes). I walked around walmart for about 20 minutes getting groceries and I had a girl ask me how I got the hole in my ear so big. I would say a 2 is a pretty good stretch size. Its not something you have to get a magnifying glass to see but its good enough to show off to the guys/girls down the street. Don't go to a 00(double zero if you dont know) because thats what is known as the "point of no return" meaning that you earlobe is completely stretched out and will not go back to regular size so I would stick with a 2 or 0. If you stretch both ears(I only do my left side), stretch one side and after it doesnt hurt to sleep on it anymore, stretch the other side.
RI9itLSRaa	Most people burn the first time they tan(:  It'll be sore for a few days but the redness should be gone by tomorrow night..You can try some ice and a good moisturizer|`|ksZSL3Nwaa	I WOULD JUST HAMMER THE STAND UP SUN BEDS BEST THING I THINK ARE IF U DONT LIKE USIN THEM JUST USE PLENTY OF FALSE TAN LIKE ME.|`|e8Jwbx4Daa	Ow! That sounds really painful. I've had tanning bed burns before too, they are the worst. :(  First off, if you go again (I can understand why you wouldn't, but just in case) you should invest in one of the nicer beds. They really do make a difference! The cheap beds burn you so much more quickly and really should only be used to maintain a tan. This is something I found out the hard way. :) The nicer, more expensive beds are actually NICE to lay in! And I've never burned in one.    Secondly, I used Apple Cider Vinegar on burns usually. It smells so bad, but it really helps. Also, you could try Noxema (you can find this at any drugstore) which helps a lot too. That one doesn't smell great either, but both of them are effective.    Good luck and sorry about the burns!!|`|gfyTOgfCaa	sounds like you were in too long, try a stand up booth next time, its gets your sides better cause you can lifts your arms. aloe solarcaine worked best for me, takes the sting out.|`|aDElEo4Xaa	you have to move around in the bed to make it even|`|fMRcX2WDaa	it only takes two days for the burn to go away for me anyways i love to burn i like the warm feeling when its 20 below out side i know its not good for my skin but i don't do it anymore it coast to much money for a stupid tan|`|t4cJy368aa	Just use a thick moisturizer lotion for your body. Avoid the sun.|`|09AUP79yaa	take a warm bath and moisturize!!!!
85KL0eUUaa	I used to use it.  It is very, very, VERY hard. You have to melt it into an oil before you can use it.  My mother got it at a health food store, try those.  It cost about $20 for a small tub.  Its scar-healing properties are overrated.    Another remedy for stretch marks and scarring (which is better and way cheaper than cocoa butter) is vitamin E oil. Buy it in capsules in a bulk box, and pierce the capsule at one end with a sewing needle, and put it where you want it.

I get great coverage, and my skin looks amazingly flawless! The sales rep at sephora or mac can really help you with the colors. They have in store displays/samples so you can expirement in store. Its great! ,   I got this great make up kit from Sephora with like 70 eyes shawdows, like 50 lip gloss and an assortment of blushes. its about 50 usd and you basically have every color imaginable!

This covers up everything and it is really creamy. For foundation I really like to use Rimmel London's Stay Matte liquid foundation because it's really lightweight but it also covers up really well.   Gold, chocolate brown, navy blue, grays, pinks, purples, greens, and black eyeshadows look really good on brown eyes. Bright blue, black, and brown eyeliner suits brown eyes well.   For mascara you should get a black volumizing mascara. Try Cover Girl's Lash Blast mascara.|`|lPCjNkEnaa	Maybelline Pure Concealer Blemish Treatment Stick, ~$5.10  E.l.f.

MAC, chanel, prescriptives, and clinique are very good.    the color purple is supposed to bring out brown eyes so i would try a good shade of purple. MAC has four or five different types of eyeliners you can choose from, some smudge easier (kohl) for a smokey eye look, some stay on exactly the way you put them (gel). i would always just go with black mascara for everyday. sometimes i like to try purple 'cause its fun and it does bring out your eyes more but for everyday, i like wearing black.    gold eyeshadow also seems to suit you. not too gold but like a lighter, shimmery gold (no glitter!). you have tan skin you said so i think lighter gold would be very good for a more subtle look than purple.|`|Y6FhzwoAaa	foundation- pressed powder that matches your skin tone    eyeshadow- RIMMEL LONDON!!!! and MAYBELLINE NY AND COVERGIRL QUADS AND TRIOS!  they are gogeous  (colored)      eyeliner-maybeline bew york define a line in ebony black         mascara- rimmel london MAXX in black (pink and black tube)        for your brown hair/eyes try nudes!  georgeous and soooo in right now!  and if you want to move it up try GOLD!  its nice and subtle yes fun at the samne time!|`|ZdNhdeVYaa	I seem to really REALLY like MAC makeup however i can be pretty expensive.... if you are willing to spend money on makeup i would suggest to get mac foundation and ask a person who works there to help you find the right shade for you and do a color match as they call it... eyeliner i like avon... and eyeshadow h.i.p ( you can get at walgreens!) and mascara...xxl by maybelline..and coverup mac! hope this helps :)|`|mamQR7JSaa	liquid powder from Covergirl.  its in a compact, either a blue case or black.  as for the colour, it needs to go with our skin colour.  if you have trouble finding the right shade, ask someone that works in the cosmetics department in the store    mascara, covergirl [i think] its in a pink bottle thing with a green lid

Yes,I do think that you are pretty.  And your friend is also pretty.  Do you have more pics of your friend?  Let her know that I think braces are beautiful.  I know a young woman I met a while back that had braces.  She looked so beautiful when she smiled.  GUYS are CONFUSING,I hope your friend knows how wonderful you are.

But you wear a little to much eye-liner on the bottom lashes. I mean on the last picture you look like someone from "Sweeney Tod".  (love johnny deep!... but not murders >.    Your friend likes to keep it natural. Or so it seems. Plus her pic is in a different color-zone (like she was in a kitchen with funky lights)...which can make all the difference. Where-as you were using a more sunny area or some lighter areas in the house.    So i personally think both of you are super pretty (:|`|CreKcqw3aa	i think u just want an excuse to put up pictures of yourself.btw ur friends a lil prettier|`|bZfsk7pbaa	your just really mean.|`|IgzotplRaa	u but ur just fishing 4 compliments so ur freind
rv4Z32VFaa	There could be a few reasons.  Have your recently experienced some kind of stress related situation or extreme illness like a heavy fever lasting for a week? If so then you could be having reactional hair loss. Google telogen effluvium.  Are you taking vitamins regularly? As we get older we all lose hair. Make sure you take vitamins! Centrum is great. There's also a vitamin called Hair, Skin, and Nails. Pretty much anything with Biotin is really good.  What is your diet like? You're 17 I know. You wanna eat cake and chips and chicken wings. I know I do. Eat an apple a day, blueberries, and I just read that Tofu is really good for thinning hair. Eat healthy. Try to squeeze in more fruits and vegetables.  Are you taking good care of your hair? Use a salon shampoo like Nioxin for thinning hair. Condition gently, And always treat your scalp gently! Once a day massage your scalp in circular motions gently.   Lasty, we all lose 50-100 strands of hair daily. So don't stress over it because that will make it worse.|`|9Xxn38ilaa	its normal dont worry about it. if huge clumps start to come out... then you have a problem|`|aMcYK663aa	I have heard that we lose over 100 hairs per day.  However, if you have noticed a huge change, try and go to a dermatologist.  Before you go, see if your hair is just breaking off or if it is coming out at the root... that will be one of their questions.  Stress, diet changes all can aid in hair loss.  Your Doc may also recommend starting taking Biotin - a vitamin that some people swear by for hair growth.
24Xy8qWtaa	Well I'm a straight female so in terms of attractiveness I don't really care, but some girls go way overboard.|`|W840msNTaa	they're cool/hot    but you can't have to many    i'm ok with:  nose stud  anything on the ear  lower labret  madonna/monroe  eyebrow    anything else is kinda bad and a turn-off.    I think others are less open to it than I am. They probably have dislike for them.|`|HiuZs5G5aa	Well for me i only like pericings on the ears. anything else and i find it unattractive. some guys like it some guys don't. i will say if you get one it will definitly lower your range of guys that will find you attractive.    i am a guy by the way.|`|sO5KeGu8aa	As a girl, I like them!  I find septums especially cute and stuff.  Also snakebites and single lip peircings.|`|CuhJRewLaa	their pretty hot    but definately no more than 2 on the face|`|781f1b49265b1eed1172c3bab9e54872aa	they arent bad unless there are too much  i dont like nose piercings or lip rings  ears are fine, as long as there arent like 5  and belly rings are hot hot hot|`|gcYDA1ZRaa	i like themm.  but depends were
jp9OzuXoaa	I don't know if I'd find it "hot", but sure, I'd think it would look cool. But get it where YOU want it.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	I don't know if I would call it "hot" necessarily, but it would be attractive. I would want to get closer to see it, maybe ask what it means. Also, it depends on what you get. Something cheesy or played out would not be attractive.|`|1f8995bd1ea7ed6c5af3096b1f72f755aa	I don't like tattoos.  I want to see the beauty of the woman not art on a woman.|`|LzWGkzSCaa	yea thats hella sexy or on the side of your neck or on your upper body. thats the best looking spots and they highlight your muscles|`|4qPsEQFlaa	dude, def across the shoulder blades. the back is one of the sexiest assets of a guy, and having a tattoo there will give you an excuse to show it off =)|`|dsYE5eSVaa	top of the shoulders and juz a bit going onto the neck looks hott as hell =P  depends what tattoo you're getting though
GbfA7Rr8aa	try a new solution like clear care.. i had the same problem turned out i was allergic to optic free and so i switched now im fine... or maybe the contact on that side is a bit to big so go to ur eye doc and see|`|3JkZPMvYaa	you should defenitly change the contact rite now it has bacteria which is very sensitive in your eyes and if which you should have back up glasses i suggest wearing them , if after a few hours its still red but its not irritating you , you probably have a cold in that eye|`|BcAocj0Naa	it might be that you have a bad contact or your eye is reacting oddly

That being said looking @ models may help they are crazy tiny.     But that just kills self esteem.    Instead of trying to feel fat why don't you set a goal? That way you have motivation and you feel amazing when you reach your goal! Plus that is constructive whereas making yourself feel like crap is destructive in many ways.     Good luck!|`|3gT4kKG4aa	EAT|`|t4cJy368aa	Drink a lot of liquids.|`|2fzjIuTIaa	compare yourself with other people. especially really close friends that are skinnier.|`|txDbluVwaa	if you are a girl:  take off your under garments and put on tight clothes and jump up and down in front of a mirror.

ZIq2IzOmaa	They're called stretched piercings. Gauge refers to the size of the jewelry, not the act of enlarging a piercing. Calling your piercings "gauges" is completely and utterly useless considering the entire continent of Europe does not use the American Wire Gauge System that the US uses. They use millimeters.    So that aside, on to your question:    You can use anti-bacterial soap if you have it handy. Use a plain variety without any weird fragrances, moisture beads, or other extras.     You can also use a sea salt soak which is made by mixing 1/4 teaspoon sea salt with 8oz warm water. Just swab the area with the soak to clean it thoroughly. This is especially useful for fresh stretches or irritated piercings. If you've got a new or aggravated piercing you can leave the jewelry in place and just soak the area for a few minutes.     Some people might be able to get away with washing their ears with a low fragrance body wash, but if you use something really smelly or with other addatives, you're better off just investing in a pump bottle of plain anti-bacterial soap.     Peroxide does not clean a healthy piercing. It is just going to strip the oils out of your skin and dry out your piercing. This can make the area more vulnerable to injury and infections.     My personal recommendation is liquid anti-bacterial soap. It's easy to use and works for the majority of people. You may find that once your ears are healed at a given size, they may not need cleaned every single day. Some people's ears get overly dry with daily cleaning, so listen to your body and clean more or less often based on your skin's response.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	No  Not sure  No    Sea salt soaks or non scented & non dyed soap would be better.    And fyi: Gauge is a unit of measurement, you can't "have gauges" you have stretched ears.|`|y8jIXgOdaa	yeah, peroxide would work best. it bubbles away the bacteria. but... body wash would work too... but not as good.|`|4qPsEQFlaa	DONT use peroxide, thats like the worst ive been told. Def sea salt is bomb for things like that! Baby body wash would work too. Nothing scented or anything like axe body wash though. And i think youre right about calling it an ear gauge, considering they have different measurements to stretch your ear to.|`|SiGVPuFmaa	I love washing my gauges in the shower. I never use body wash though. I use DIAL soap because its anti bacterial & doesn't dry my skin.    hope it works out. peace
dXDroPtfaa	Yes!  I bought some jeans from Abercrombie and they were the super stoned/damaged..And after a couple months of usage the holes got bigger and it looked kind of..Icky.|`|s75GfCGeaa	yeah|`|ADkusTVXaa	My Jeans from Hollister and American Eagle both spread. Make sure (don't be stupid like me) and put your foot on one of the holes, that will make it bigger. And over time they just get larger.
8fe960abd1f73651086929a6f1d5b447aa	the swelling on my tragus didn't go away completely for like, 6 months. it'll hurt for a while. just make sure you take good care of it!|`|1ycL4PZ8aa	It isn't hard to stray from the beaten path, is it? Whatever the hell you have, get rid of it--that means removal or excision. Would someone please explain what piercing is good for?|`|Nj58Vi62aa	Go back to where you got it pierced and ask what to do ! maybe you have swimmers ear at the same time ? you can easily get swimmers ear from not drying properly from a shower ! But i would ask a professional :)|`|tyD7OOFCaa	ok, I'll bite, what is a tragus?|`|853fd2c5ba7e089875fdc909f31d8bd9aa	I've had my tragus pierced since September and it still bothers me at times even if I clean it everyday.  The first time I got it pierced it wasn't swollen and not red, but now it's swollen and bleeds a little at times.  I just keep cleaning it because I know my ears take a long time to heal.  My cartilage took a long time for it to heal.  You're fine, just keep cleaning it with the solution they have given you, but if it gets really bad it might be better to take it out.
KwNpyp3saa	If your school doesn't offer a cosmetology program, see if another school does and if you can get on a program to study there. If this isn't possible and you are thinking about owning your own salon you should take accounting, business and management classes. Other than that, then you could attend a beauty school after you graduate. Good luck.|`|0ac02757252bf3673e5594f1927600faaa	chemistry, and when you graduate h.s. go into cosmetology, hair business|`|E9F6qjRWaa	ummm...its pretty basic. i guess math so you can know angles for when you learn different hair cuts.     some schools have a cosmo. program|`|MgVsTOidaa	check with your local community college, depending where you live majority of community colleges offer summer classes for many different hobbies.

It is so easy for men.  Think about it:  Man: any occasion, interview, hot date, going to church, whatever.  Men cannot go wrong in a suit with tie.  Plus we don't wear makeup.  But women are like:  "how much makeup, what colors" and "dress or pant suit" or "sandals or boots?" good grief.  its pathetic.
z6sTfQ0Qaa	your mom is right! platinuim blonde is just wrong if you're not really bonde blonde to start.... i would advise LOTS of all over high lights pref bleach if your already kinda blonde. this will make your hair look blonde with out too many bad roots ... easier to maintain too! but if you bleach be careful not to do this to much or your hair will begin to split at the ends which is BAD! so do this once every three months to maintain and in between use nice and easy root touch up or if your hair is too thick just get a bottle of nice and easey its really the best at home you can do to not dammage! don't go to a cost cutters, supper cuts, great clips, or any chain salon thats cheap! always invest in your hair! go to reputable local salon. good luck!|`|i4b0xzSWaa	Well when you tell the people at the salon you want 9/10 times your hair is going to look great. But you got to be specific on what you want done with your hair!!!!!!Good Luck|`|402001bd835df137698f75c2569b8406aa	As a cosmetologist, let me start off by saying... whatever you do, please go to a professional to get your hair colored!  I've seen too many people come in with orange hair from trying to color their hair at home!  Now, let me say, I have "dirty-blonde" hair naturally, and am at a golden-blond color right now.  I color it about every 4 weeks, and yes, the outgrowth can be ugly, but if you dedicate your time and money to getting it recolored every 4 to 6 weeks, then it wont be that bad.  Just choose an appropriate level and tone of blonde, so that it will look semi-natural and pretty... there are too many blondes in this world with "orange" hair and an inch of dark blonde outgrowth!  TRASH!!!  Or you could always do hi-lights... they are more natural and don't require as much dedication to retouches.  Hope this helps  :-)|`|59uL6oEVaa	I bleach my hair, then use toner but I have red hair and I try to make it white so you would probably just have to bleach it. Any time you dye hair and you let the roots grow in its going to look somewhat bad.  DONT USE LAUNDRY ROOM BLEACH!!  BLEACH FOR YOUR HAIR IS DIFFRENT!!!  Also get deep conditioner!!!!    ~Go to Sally's beauty supply and the workers will help you out and show you what products to use. Its hard to get and give good info on how long to do it when I can't see your hair, or talk face to face. SO BEST BET GO TO SALLY'S BEAUTy supply!!|`|cZ6SAPIvaa	trust me, blond hair can be hard to manage. before school started i went to get my hair done at a professional salon so they could dye my hair light blond at the top and dark brown underneath but since im naturally a brunette and only 14 years old, they said they couldn't dye it bleach blond because my hair is too young and would get seriously damaged so they used the lightest hair colour they had without using any bleach and my hair ended up looking great but the blond was more of a yellow/gold blond instead of the platinum blond i wanted. for the first few months i LOVED my hair but then my roots started growing out and it made my hair look oily and greasy. since getting just ur roots done at the salon can be expensive, i bought some hair dye at a drug store and my mom dyed my roots for me but when my hair dryed it ended up not being the same blond colour as the rest of my blond hair so the very top was dark blond, the middle was yellow blond, and the bottom was dark brown and my hair looked retarded! but now i dyed my hair dark brown and it looks better :) soo if ur not naturally blond then its not really a great idea but if ur close to blond then go for it but u might get bored with ur blonde hair after about 4 months. good luck :)
rZuxtNl9aa	They're both gorgeous!  I wouldn't have known they were kids sizes if you hadn't told me!

d08430e598590d8554dc748d5d4c5293aa	OMG ME 2! i am a C cup, and i want to be a D or a DD! well, my boob size fluctuates. Usually i can fill out the C cup, but certain times my bra is a little loose (and that pisses me off). Also, my boobs are off to the sides, so most pushup bras (even w/ the sqeeze) do not give me cleavage. it is so frustrating. so whatever makes you happy. if your dream ideal body has playboy bunny boobs, go for it! just remember that there may be complications w/ implants and scarring. if you want to nurse your children in the future, there is a SLIGHT chance that implants will interfere. well... good luck and make sure you consult a competent plastic surgeon. x0x.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	i have DDD's and i hate them its imposable to find a cutie bra that fits no sexy bras for you. also your back will be killing you every single day for the rest of your life.as you get older they will sag down to your knees when your not wearing a bra.. they get in the way they hurt their uncomfortable trust me. stick with what you have c's are a Perfect size not to big and not to small.|`|1bvl5zbkaa	Serious?|`|Z5A33IR3aa	well i guess if you want back problems to go for it|`|DySN1Zdbaa	I think that God made you the way you are, boobs and all.  and that you should just be happy with what you have.|`|C5Wlt3rGaa	Well first of all,  An E Cup?  If most people have never heard of it, than it's probably not good.  Second of all,   That can give you major back problems!  Third of all,  I think humungo boobs are a little gross.|`|xkZbjKNdaa	NO  ur big enough   stick with what God gave you|`|oKoABzNtaa	You aren't nearly mature enough to even consider cosmetic surgery.  No doctor with the merest scruples will touch you.|`|I1SP0tBMaa	if you are a c you are just fine, an e is ridiculous unless you are going to become a porn star|`|dA2zqiZ0aa	absolutely not!!!!!    YOU REALLY SHOULD NOT DO IT TRUST ME MY SISTER HAD A BOOB JOB AND SHE REALLY REALLY I MEAN REALLY REGRETED IT HER BOOBS AME OUT ALL LOB SIDED AND GROSS EEWEY AND I REALLY THINK U SHOULDNT  TRUST ME U SHOULD STAY THE SIZE U ARE!!!!!!!!!!|`|1c8ea5969ab46c77a9c66dea8a748209aa	NOOOOOOOOOO!, don't do it. Fakes look disgusting & come with a whole host of medical trouble. C's are a perfect size & if guys don't like them, make them get smaller hands.|`|pcoa5zH2aa	Don't waste your money.  Your boobs are fine, hun.  Be thankful.  Getting a boob job is slutty unless you're a size A.  I'm not sayin you're a slut.  Just don't do it.  It's a waste....especially if you have a C cup.  You won't be able to fit into anything.  Someone I know got one done (and she's not fat) and now she only wears one dress because it's the only thing that fits her boobs now.|`|kH81xs9Waa	I know a few years is forever right now, but you should wait until you're done growing.  You could be an E cup soon, and think of what a two inch implant would look like on top of those!  Besides, guys are pretty intimidated by HUGE boobs.|`|DJYJqYleaa	GO FOR IT!!!    Circus freaks=HOTTAYS!|`|AA11635143	Stop your screaming, a boob job isn't that important.  whisper.

Hun, it's brains before boobs every time.|`|A0tWlG94aa	you should be glad with what you have.. a size c cup is perfect  to be honest i think boob jobs look really stupid and weird...|`|zN3C2NDzaa	OMG!!!!!Have you lost your mind? First, the damage to the skin on your breast will be irreparably damaged. In the very likely event you have to have this surgery reversed, your poor boobs will look like wrinkled socks hanging limply from your chest. If you are determined to have BIGGER boobs, buy some of those silicone inserts you can put in your bra and extend your reach ( so to speak) Wait till you reach your full potential and remember the bigger the boob the longer it eventually hangs.|`|1Z6ELlIgaa	NO. C's are fine, DD is like the extreme, maybe past extreme, limit. You're fine. Believe, girls with HUGE breasts look like freaks. And not beautyful.|`|M9DWMQijaa	just do with whatever u feel comfortable with|`|JXsLiAJqaa	omg! youll be stared @ and NOT in a good way!! i only think slutz and hookers on the streets are e cups! thats just grossss!! dont do it!|`|vZuzT3cTaa	natural is better..think about this, 4 a boob job, they cut off your nipples then put fat in them  sew you back up. it will take weeks for u 2 look normal again|`|n4NeR353aa	wow. dont do it. its disgusting looking.|`|541706a8fdfa283a86f620e73dd1d9b2aa	When they start to sag 5 years from now YOU WILL regret it. Many guys prefer a lean athletic body with smaller breasts......they just won't admit it since the standard taught to guyz is that bigger is better. You are fine. Besides it would be unethical for a doctor to do surgery on a girl still developing|`|eu0H1js5aa	I have c size boobs too, I think they are troublesome. I don't like them. If I was you I wouldn't, they are already big enough to attract guys, yet small enough not to be a wanna be Pamela Anderson. Big boobs don't contribute a lot unless you are a porno star. When you want to get a job you want people to concentrate more on you, than your boobs. Just keep them as you are. I hope you make the right decision.|`|1wjeXqyqaa	to be honest i think its not suck a good idea r boobs sound good already just keep them|`|AA12062220	if ur already a C i rly don't think u should get a boob job  i've talked to a lot of guys and they all said a girls body is much more attractive when her boobs r in proportion to her body, they don't necessarily like huge boobs  i think u should stay a C, its natural and already a great size!|`|k5KuYkkKaa	You don't need it. Besides your back will hate you for it.|`|tjGFRs1Kaa	NO I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BECAUSE A C IS PRETTY BIG ANYWAYS AND HAVING A BOOB JOB TO MAKE YOUR BOOBS A SIZE E WOULD JUST BE FAKE, AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T WEAR A SIZE E.

LMFAO!!!|`|1fIQXPP5aa	...you're gonna have back probems if you do.|`|AA12133586	u do know that after u get them done u still have to get them out after 10 yrs right? why not just wear a push up bra? girl would kill for ur cup size|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	don't do it.  its really not worth it.

I WAS a C until  igot pregnant and nursed... I was a f-g while nursing and now I am STILL a DD/E. I would give anything to not have this pain, this discomfort, this pain in the *** pair of heavy bags on my chest.     I cants jog, i cant wear normal clothes (you think those big boobs are going to fit into normal shirts that actually fit your waist? think again sweet heart), you cant find bras, and if you do, theyre assugly, and then theres the pain in your shoulders and back from them, not to mention that time and gravity are MUCH harder on larger breasts than they are smaller ones.     Just shut the hell up okay. I would give ANYTHING not to be lugging these things around anymore. I cant believe people pay money and go thorugh huge amounts of risk and pain just to be ravaged by gravity and back pain and frustration.    Be glad for what you have.    Ugh|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	So your goal is to look like a freak?    Size C is just fine.

dA2zqiZ0aa	three words!!    concealer concealer concealer   i have the same problem u won't get rid of it with sleep trust me dont listen to people that say that trust me it really wont help. its make you need just grab a concealer that matches Ur skin tone and u put it under ur eyes were the dark circles are and you just dab it until it starts to blend in right. u might want to get cover up too to even out ur skin  tone because the concealer will not always be ur exact shade then eye liner because ur face will start to look funny. you might as well start using make up haha that's how i started it's not bad at all you don't have to use make up it's just a recommendation     =] hope it helps|`|A0tWlG94aa	concealer and a really good foundation...i would recommend supercover. you can get it many different shades and makes your skin look absoultely flawless|`|AA11161570	Home remidies:  Vaseline at night!  and cucumbers help a lot too!

CFZhTiQuaa	I actually made a shirt using wordle toady. I went to Staples and bought some iron-on printables. They were easy to use if you have a printer that prints mirror images. (I almost forgot to do that so DON'T FORGET) You can also get the printing pages for them at WallMart. They are a good price. At Staples I also got some printable magnet sheets so I can have magnets too!

qmORT5ISaa	well if your relationship with your mom is okay then there shouldn't be a problem =], besides - i think you're at that age..but to each it's own.    the only thing that i would worry about if i were you would be how your eyebrows would look after getting them waxed.  i've tried waxing, threading, and plucking my eyebrows..and the best thing you can do with your eyebrows is thread them! it doesn't damage your skin and if your eyebrows are as dark and bushy as you said they were..then it'd look a lot better than waxing..cuz then it looks like you're missing a patch of your face lol    hope it somehow helps|`|4keGomSTaa	i jjust got mine for the first time today actuallly ;] ITS SIMPLE. ,they usually know that you just want them shaped and you dont have to say anything . but if your nervous just say i want them shaped please. it doesnt hurtttt youuull be fiiinee !|`|3JkZPMvYaa	you should wax i thread my eyebrows its like plucking except much faster it hurts just a little bit the first few times but when you get used to it its nothing .. you should't wax because when you get older the skin under your eyebrows will start to  heng and just thinking bout it ewwwwwww.. not much places do it its mostly like and indian thing but you can youtube it and learn the way that you can do it yourself|`|bhF67mXUaa	You should definetly ask your mom, or atleast your sister who can mention it to your mom or take you to get the waxed.  If that doesn't work then just pluck them yourself (but be carefull not to pluck too much!)|`|KJCHUVe5aa	I started getting my eye brows waxed much earlier than you so I am sure age won't be an issue.

10de9a875cf94a4ef7d681f8c14dd791aa	If you're questioning whether or not you want to keep it dyed then I suggest you just go back to blonde.  I dyed my hair red after my freshman year of high school because a lot of people always treated me like an idiot because I'm a natural blonde.  I was so stupid to do that.  Anyway, I missed my old hair color because taking care of dyed hair is too hard, plus I didn't look good as a red.  I think it would be better if I saw a before and after shot, but I just say go with your gut; if you are tired of worrying about your roots or about your color fading then just go back to blonde.  But if you like your hair better black (I'm assuming that is your current hair color because of your avatar) then keep it!  My mom is a natural brunette, but she has had her hair dyed red for the past 12-13 years, and it looks fantastic on her!  I couldn't see her with any other color.  Hope I was able to help!|`|YOvAZfKRaa	well you need to post a before and after pic cuz idk|`|oRbxIRHYaa	Naw, blond is a myth. :)        Good Luck!|`|sqW4uRqdaa	Yeah.|`|zPA0kiZNaa	I generally think that people with naturally blonde hair look best with blonde. But, it would depend on what it looks like now. If you're tired of it and want to change it back to blonde, you can....|`|et9lDdwoaa	it all an opinon question. personally i dont really like blonde hair. why dont you try dying it a completely diferent color if your not satisfied with the way it is now. i love to die my hair because i can express myself better with the diferent colors, and cause i get boredwith the same color. and if you dye it a diferent color and decide you dont want it, remember it can always be died back =) hope you find a look that works!!|`|7cbef831f7563f52decc4a5d7b871738aa	Most defiantly! You can tell when hair is dyed (by your avatar it looks like it is black). When I get a first impression of a person a notice their hair first and if it is dyed I think fake. So I hope you take my advice and get it back to blonde!       Hope I helped!
Ue9xrUkbaa	My mom and I got it from Walgreens, and it works if you do what the instructions say, but you have to follow it at least 4 more times then what they say, plus you can only work a little area at a time, so it takes at least 30 minutes for each leg. I would recommend not getting this, because although the price, it takes forever, and not very well.|`|FnQWXyp8aa	in my opinion, theres nothing wrong with shaving. And smooth away i would imagine would REALLY irritate skin, think about it.|`|xoXkHOVsaa	I looked this up a little while ago.  People who bought it off the infomercial said it was a scam.  People who bought it at bed bath and beyond, or walgreens said it worked ok.  It's only $10 at those stores, so buy it there to save some money.|`|csuWY67uaa	It works okay, but the hair grows back just as quickly as it does with shaving. personally after using it, i'd have to prefer shaving or waxing.   answer mine, please?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...
lxYWZc9caa	Have you ever heard of Michael Jackson?  Well he's black.  But why would you want to change that anyway?|`|jH8hIB0kaa	Ask Michael Jackson.|`|5af8PNwxaa	Why ?   Why would you want this...we should all embrace our differences - not try and change them.    If they ever did this...to me that would not be ethical, just like the cloning of any human being a copy of yourself.   This would be against everything that a doctor stands for.
wXloRCegaa	If you have oily skin it will show through anything, girl.  There is no foundation or powder that is going to soak it up for you, but what will is this awesome primer from Philosophy.  It's called Never Let Them See You Shine.  So, in between your moisturizer and your foundation just apply a little bit of this primer and it will create a barrier between your face and your makeup, while absorbing the excess oil.  Never Let Them See You Shine is a lightweight matifying primer that dramatically reduces oil and shine while providing a velvet matte finish. The unique formula contains a powerful anti-irritant cocktail that calms and soothes skin while enhancing skin exfoliating and trans epidermal water loss. You will instantly notice minimized pores and a shine-free canvas.    Here's a link...  http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...    If you scroll down the page there are hundreds of reviews on it.|`|sKMA00QNaa	Okay hun, I go though a lot worse so this is what you have to do. It seems like your oily on your t-zone and cheeks so what you need to do is stop using any liquid foundation and buy mineral make up I reccomend Bare Escentuals. Before going to sleep and in the morning use neutrogena pore cleanser morning wash, they have many buy one for oily skin, next before bed and after the neutrogena always moisturize! I recommend Bare Escentuals moisturizer, I tried searching for many oil/shine control moisturizers at the drugstore but I can't find any. Next you should buy a primer that helps oil/shine control or you should totally buy Murads oil-control mattifier! Heard its great I want to get it, so then after the primer you should use the bare escentuals foundation. You should buy the Bare escentuals hydrating mineral veil. Remember oily skin can be genetic or caused by bad eating habits but hydrating the skin with lotions and drinking lots of water helps a ton, also keepy blotting sheets with you! Good luck! Oh yeah hun that philosophy primer didn't work for me at all maybe it will for you since your not oily all over|`|claW4UUcaa	get those blotting tissues for shine control and use a good t zone face wash.|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	No blotting tissues. Get POWDER. That will stop it immediately. I see that your powder is not working-- get shine-proof powder (that's what I have, from Prescriptives, in Holt Renfrew)  -Fellow shiner|`|0L0teu7jaa	Make sure you're ALWAYS using a moisturizer... Not using one actually forces your skin to produce more oil. I would use a translucent powder like Urban Decay's De-slick powder. Please don't be one of those people that keeps putting on more powder FOUNDATION. (Just because it's a powder doesn't mean it's not a foundation)|`|RsDAGnBhaa	Just genes, some people naturally just produce more oil. Uh i don't think there's any permanent way to stop the oil but there's face washes, if you have extra money to spend there's oil absorbing sheets that you can carry around with you to just fix during the day. (i think neutrogena and clean & clear have them) and just carrying a powder with you helps absorb oil too     hope this helps >-|`|TUkDOIR0aa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out several products.The review site is pretty good at http://www.brandsmakeup.com visit and browse the reviews.|`|2U27BgmKaa	Well, make sure that you using a face cleanser, toner and moisturizer everyday. That's the best start. Then, if you continue to get that shiny look, use Urban Decay De-Slick Mattifying Powder. One of these will last you well over a year and work amazing! It's easy to carry around, completely natural so it won't irritate your skin, and works wonders in small amounts. Remember if you skin is producing more oil, it's because of the lack of moisture in your skin it's trying to make up for. By the way, please don't use Maybeline. Is any makeup worth killing bunnies over? Go with a cruelty-free brand that doesn't test on animals.|`|JtcWfQ1uaa	blotting papers for sure they leave the makeup but take the oil, u can get them at walgreens, walmart, sephora or sheercover.com    :)|`|420b488758fd919f03fd6da33dbabf9baa	your pretty lol|`|Yue2YKTnaa	use face wash neutrogena|`|LMPF5X4raa	I use a lotion from MaryKay..its some kind of oil reducing thing. but i would look into their products cuz they're great :)
10de9a875cf94a4ef7d681f8c14dd791aa	Usually the average is about 1/2 in per month.  If you want your hair to grow a bit faster I would suggest using Mane 'N Tail Shampoo and Conditioner.  I tried them after hearing a lot of good things about them and I noticed a difference right away.  You can even find them at Walmart.|`|KFwXBXv7aa	1/2 inch per month    6 inches in 1 year|`|7aK81hsbaa	1/2" per month.|`|AA10739151	Just let it go...it will grow the whole month.|`|402001bd835df137698f75c2569b8406aa	The average person's hair will grow 1/2 inch per month.|`|0krTpGRqaa	It varies a bit from person to person. Some people's hair grows about as fast as a turtle crawls, while others on average grow about 1 and a half inches. Other hair (such as mine) grows pretty darn fast.     It takes on average about 2 weeks for my hair to grow an inch. So that's 2 inches a month. That really adds up as time goes by. I know I probably didn't help much. Just trying to give you an idea.|`|sjzUIWEUaa	it grows abotu 1/2 and inche per month. ~6 inches per year

Even people who dress nice to me are taking care of themselves, but they need personality to go along with it.    I hate people who dress like hobos seriously. Why be sad about life when we are given a life to think about. We have so much money and lucky to have it-- might as well have fun before it ends!    But no one on this earth can be prettiest so yes I think girls who try to be prettiest than everyone is dumb because there is a rule called Eye of the Beholder whether we like it or not.    Why would you want to be ugly? unless your trying to degrade yourself or end up dying|`|z8VRBWPDaa	???????????????|`|yqgjjwbqaa	no way id rather be pretty than ugly!!
s63bm0Guaa	Hair turns grey because  your body produces melanin which gives your hair skin and eyes pigment, and over time your body slows down the process of producing melanin.  therefor hair stats to turn grey, there is no melanin left in it...also your skin becomes paler, and eyes also lighten with age.|`|YB63U3Pgaa	everyone has pre-determined pigmentation which makes their hair the colour that it is. Depending on genes this will happen at different stages in everyone life, looking at your parents will help you know when this "may" happen. Bascially as you get older you sort of run out of this pigmentation and thats why your hair will start to come through as grey. Apart from dying your hair there is nothing you can do to stop this from happening. <br>  <br>  Have you spotted a few grey's lol|`|Zjb4p1TRaa	The pigments in your hair start to change due to age which results in the colour of your hair becoming gray, you may find that it becomes thinner too.<br>  Just like your skin, the pigments change colour.|`|IowG78BGaa	when your body runs out of color pigment for your hair, it turns gray.|`|1a528d2870eb7875be6fd0e16f069929aa	your body change so sometime your body change thing inside of you and it could cause your hair gray|`|bf3bc2c3811507a54ef69dd9118ca5a3aa	Getting older causes gray hair, atleast if it doesn't fall out first (for men).<br>  Sometimes vitamin deficiency can cause premature gray.
lPCjNkEnaa	probably, just be sure to blend it everywhere (into your hairline and jaw bones) so that it doesn't look unnatural. See if people think you've gotten a tan.|`|VN2wyTnFaa	If it's the same exact color as your skin, you can definitely still use it. The only thing that might be an issue is that it might not give you a ton of coverage, but if you're happy with it, go for it. I'd personally suggest using it as a setting powder for liquid or cream foundation, but really it's up to you. Good luck!|`|Jh0yyYizaa	Well why not?  Its designed for your face isn't it?   Of corse you can use it as a foundation.   If it works for you, then great!|`|claW4UUcaa	yeah you can use it for powder. it sounds like you don't need a bronzer. be brave try a bright pink! bronzers are also great when wearing a tank. rub some in your cleavage to make it look deeper.

eMSv7RwYaa	that's quite tall.it depends when you had your growth spurt,if you've had it already then you probably wont grow too much more and you will end up a good height.|`|TO5RtlxFaa	Its taller than average but height usually depends on your parents height|`|4m4NRJJ1aa	I'd say 5'5 and I'm 5'4|`|cjMai5PGaa	that is really tall lol for kansas at least|`|Wlwk1kVAaa	There isn't really an "average height" for any age. As long as You are all in proportion. Eg. Bmi (Body mass index). If you go<br>   to your doctor and ask for help and information on your body mass index I'm sure he/she will measure your bmi. It isn't recommended to measure your own online, as you may have incorrect height/weight information.|`|KGQYogeraa	sure thats how tall i was/am. but now im 15 and about 5'8-ish|`|19DLoSbBaa	No, that's above average.

I think that they would both look nice on you but i think maybe you should go with the lip because monroes sometimes make people look like cats idk why though x]|`|fG6c1mXHaa	the bottom lip would look good, I'm going to show my ignorance and ask,"what is a monroe?"|`|VN2wyTnFaa	Go for the monroe.

I had a girlfriend who got a La Brae (below your lip), and it looked really trashy.  Monroe piercings look doubly trashy.  I don't like them at all.    Remember that when you get a lip piercing, you are advised not to kiss anyone or perform oral sex with anyone for about 3 months, or you run the risk of some SERIOUS infections.    Also remember that people **WILL JUDGE YOU** based on your appearance.  Having facial piercings will limit the types of jobs that you can get.  There is no such thing as a professional-looking piercing on your head outside of your ears.|`|yko1tx4jaa	monroe probably.    or a really small stud if you get your lip.|`|ZnfZiZyzaa	dont get piercings, you to pretty without them. it will just harden you. and when you older your gonna say i hate this wholes. think about the long run. stray from the crowd. it will save you plastic surgery when your older.|`|9vLJbiHeaa	NONE you look reli pretty and a piercing would reli chage ur face i no it sounds gay but its true  but if u really want one badly then a monroe  x|`|4d8vzYbqaa	you must have yellow teeth or something, because I definitely noticed the teeth whitening effect in the first picture. nice try =) hahahaha|`|EL45UeUJaa	Bottom lip piercing, you have a pretty full lip, it would look good :)|`|cvRscoQ3aa	bottom lip|`|W9B6EJrWaa	A plain brown paper bag would really bring out the best in you.|`|Zy5TyS8gaa	monroe|`|YKKrzbP0aa	none

It works as a good anti-dandruff treatment.     -Massage the oil of arnica, marigold, rosemary and southernwood into the scalp. It is very useful in hair loss.    -Make an aloe vera shampoo. When combined with wheat germ oil and coconut milk, aloe vera gel makes a shampoo to promote hair growth. Use the shampoo as often as you wash your hair.     -Use aloe vera gel to treat the areas of the scalp that are going bald. Aloe vera contains an enzyme that helps promote new hair growth for some people. The gel can be applied directly to the scalp, as aloe vera typically has no side effects.      1.Drinking plenty of water and eating plenty of raw fruits and vegetables is probably the best way to achieving healthy hair.      2.Vitamins B, C, F, zinc, iron, copper and protein are essential for hair growth.     3. Brush your hair gently with preferably wooden brushes to increase hair growth.     4.Boil 1 cup of celery leaves with stems, strain and add juice of 1 lemon. You can   rinse your hair with this after washing your hair. It makes your hair look healthy   and lustrous.     5.Lavender oil has been shown to increase hair growth so massage the oil once a week and soak for 30 minutes before washing.     6.If one wants to grow hair, trim the hair once every month.     7.Never brush the hair when it is wet.     8.Massage aloe vera gel over the scalp and leave it for about one hour.After this rinse the hair with warm water. It gives amazing results for hair growth.     9.Rinsing your hair with apple cider vinegar and sage tea helps in hair growth     10.Boil rosemary leaves in water and use this water while washing your hair daily to improve hair growth.     11.Massaging your scalp vigorously with your fingers promotes hair growth.     12.Rinsing your hair with one juiced lemon and one cup of water is said to bring   life and shine back to dull hair.     13.Rub olive oil into the scalp to promote hair growth.     14.Massage the scalp with egg yolk, leave for 1 hour and wash.     15.Rub olive oil into the scalp to promote hair growth.     16.Rinse hair with a mix of apple cider vinegar and sage tea to help hair grow.    hope i helped =]|`|YRcgUOBjaa	i take biotin it is a nail and hair supplement it helps ur hair and nails grow faster stronger and healthier.  hope this was help|`|IwMxsLsKaa	You can't override your genetic hair growth, but here.    - Avoid heating items(flat irons, iron curler, ect)  - Vitamins  - Trims every 8 weeks|`|402001bd835df137698f75c2569b8406aa	The key to having your hair grow faster is both good nutrition/health and hair follicle stimulation.  So, taking a multi-vitamin, like a pre-natal vitamin will help... and so will getting scalp massages or electrode-therapy.  Some salons have this available... its using electricity to stimulate your hair follicles... and it has been known to allow your hair to grow 2 inches in one month! (the average hair growth is 1/2 inch per month)  Going 3 times a week, for 5 to 10 minutes each session will really help your hair grow... and it's relatively cheap.

C0HZ8ZB4aa	The shoulder is the joint, the blade is the bone at the back. When referring to tattoos, I see 'shoulder tattoos' as being on the joint or slightly under, on the outside of the upper arm. 'Shoulder blade tattoos' I see as being actually on your back, round the other side of the joint, on the bit of bone you can feel at the top that you can see move on each side of your back as you move your arms around.    Shoulder blades hurt more as they're right on the bone, although they might be slightly less prone to stretching over the years than the shoulder, if one was to gain a fair bit of weight. For a woman, shoulder blades are easier to hide than shoulders (vest tops) but a man probably wouldn't have much trouble hiding either if needs be. Personally I think shoulder blade tattoos look better than shoulder tattoos, but of course that's just an opinion.|`|84a92b794a6ae292684ad41ae82b80b4aa	A shoulder tattoo will cover more body area on you .   If you want to tell the world how you feel , or want to   show   us your thoughts with a picture , the larger   the tattoo the better seen and understood by others.  The only Cons about a tattoo I feel are , something   copied , stupid , cute, pretty, Asian , tribal ,  s , or words .  Kinda understand ??? 10 points is cool with me .|`|C0K3Bo2Aaa	I've had both. The shoulder is the bicep right. For me the blade hurt more. No fat or muscle for cushioning.|`|pGF6Xdghaa	i don't think there is that much of a difference really..  in case you don't like it you should airbrush it..  or  do it with pen..  good luck!!: )|`|7uzBqsJIaa	A shoulder tattoo is on your shoulder.

Find a good hairdresser. Ask her opinion on cute styles. Always keep her natural texture in mind. Don't go against it. Ponytails are timeless. Spruce it up by adding a headband or making some bangs at the front by leaving loose hairs at the front. Straighten the hair and part it down the middle or put a hairband in. Curl the bottoms. Make a messy bun. Add some cute barettes. Braid some bits. Does she like your hair? Style hers like you do yours. Is she in love with Miley Cyrus? Look up some pictures of Miley and style her hair that way. Ask her what she thinks is cute. Talk to her. She may just be nervous  because of 1st day jitters.

Shortly after my granddaughter turned 9, my daughter bought her a training bra, not because she wanted one, but because she needed one.  Why doesn't your sister ask your mother "Mom, don't you think I need a training (cup) bra?"  I know some can't talk to their parent(s) about sex, but this is entirely a different matter.|`|XyOsRQvgaa	tell your mom you need to go shopping with her for new clothes, and casually stroll into the underwear section and pick one up (: lol. then you get an added bonus of new clothes too|`|z8VRBWPDaa	ask her when she is alone with her. and you could help her. its a girl thing|`|uxuAgrtJaa	Just ask her!

Zjb4p1TRaa	That's crazy!<br>  You must never use just conditioner. <br>  Conditioner is for taming knots and making hair look shiny by adding the right balance of oils back into it.<br>  If your hair is greasy, you're adding more oils and it'll become very unmanageable. <br>  Shampoo first, to clean away the dirty and grease, and then conditioner.|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	No, I use both because using just conditioner alone won't really wash it as well as shampoo would.<br>  <br>  If you want, just buy a two in one and then get a bottle of conditioner.

I read this tip about washing with conditioner only in the book "Curly Girl."  I don't remember who the author is.|`|KGppArcfaa	This is called co washing, its based on the opinion you dont need detergents to clean the hair.

Most hair salons will even wash your hair twice i always do, the first wash will get rids of everyday dirt and grim you pick up and the 2nd i find gives it a deep clean. And you dont need to use loads of shampoo or conditioner a mistake made by so many people. So should only apply conditoner to the mid lenght and ends of your hair and then gently smooth over your roots, if you use to much conditioner you can make your hair lank and unmanageable.<br>  <br>  just to add 2in1's are a waste of time they contradict each other.|`|s63bm0Guaa	conditioner does not "cleanse" hair.<br>  you need shampoo because it has a bit of a higher PH so it will open the cuticle of the hair letting the dirt out.  Then the conditioner is used as a PH balancer to neutralize and bring the hair back to a normal PH (thats why we recommend the matching conditioner to the shampoo) The conditioner closes the cuticle back down, therefor making it soft and shiny and tangle free again.|`|A4yrPokPaa	It depends on your hair type, but you should still occasionally use the shampoo too.  If you have oily hair then its not gonna work out very well for you, but if not then it could help- it makes colors last longer.  You can also just not wash your hair everyday, go to every other or every 2 days before washing it (still take a shower though!!) I have heard that this is better for your hair too, just letting your natural oils moisturize your hair a little more...|`|IowG78BGaa	thats nasty, hun. shampoo opens your hair folicles and deep cleans and gets the dirt out. conditioner closes the hair folicles, and moistens your hair. if you dont use shampoo, you arent getting into the hair folicles, and that still leaves your hair dirty.|`|f2ZNJy48aa	I use both. I put the shampoo in, rinse it out, the put the conditioner in. You can try a 2-in-1 if you want. That gives you shampoo and conditioner in the same bottle.|`|budOTAtgaa	Yeah. I use both also because I guess my hair doesn't produce enough oils. That's what conditioner is used for and the shampoo is to clean and strengen you hair.|`|ExFE9aQxaa	No, wash with shampoo. It removes whatever nasty stuff you picked up during the day. Condition after you shampoo, but only about twice a week.. conditioning too often is bad for your hair.|`|dltzzsCraa	ew no. use both. conditioner does not clean, it gives some moisture back after you wash your hair. the shampoo actually does the cleaning.|`|KIYGztCXaa	I wash my hair with shampoo to remove grease and dirt.<br>  I then use conditioner and leave it on for about 2 mins to moisturize and give my hair shine :)|`|BMSwHyGWaa	idk about that, shampoo gets out all of the dirt. so its necessary, and then the conditioner makes it not dry|`|z2MEWrg6aa	I would for sure use Shampoo, but Conditioner makes your hair smooth and soft.

It's helped me quite a bit in caring for my skin, perfecting my makeup application, and other good beauty tips. If you're not sure, get it at the library and check it out. She talks very simply, shows some of her work and displays age-appropriate stuff. Her tips are timeless. I highly recommend it.|`|pA1UubScaa	AHHMAZING BOOK. buy it!|`|AaYEgDwWaa	Ohh I have it it's Bobbi brown Makeup Maunnel I love it I got it for Christmas from my boy friend
D2bx76kJaa	I use plumbs and brownish reds. are you only using lipgloss or are you wearing more make up than that? I would suggest some coverage to even out your skin tones and a bit of blush on your cheeks and warm tones on your eyes like sable & brown mascarra is very inportant to make your eyes pop and follow with a nice shade of plumb for the lips.|`|R8N2QTU9aa	the second one it will go great with your eyes|`|a1ymHaWAaa	i think coral or peach colors would be good|`|NUvu9vMDaa	none of the pictures show up|`|nCFnFLCDaa	two of your lipgloss links are broken|`|ao5CeroVaa	second one|`|sBgCUQWzaa	HOLY S**T|`|8K52kg4Yaa	Can't see the pictures.|`|3QYwZRrmaa	go lipstick (a light red) lip gloss just looks to kiddy and girly (most guys dont like it)    http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|JFhLlpFRaa	UR REALLY PRETTY AND THE 3RD 1:)|`|b6dd766795b2323f7f9fcbc373494574aa	the first 2 links dont work but i think by the pic of you that you should do something simple maybe just a pink or red no dark red.,|`|zub6aYxHaa	i saw your pictures and i think you would look good in light shades, like a sparkly pink or a peach, redish pinks  because you have fare skin dont go to bright. and ps. i couldnt get to those links|`|wU2SvL6Qaa	i think any light to medium pink like grapefruit or coral would look beautiful on you, and if you want to get noticed you can wear cherry red =]|`|LPJcNXMVaa	Well since you are a lighter skin tone I will suggest :Glossy Gloss -Jelly Pops any color Also Mega Brilliance Lip gloss the light pink  You dont want any dark colors cuz it will bring more attention to your lips .Unless you want that attention        Hope this helps|`|vZuzT3cTaa	light pink or natural colors are the best to use.|`|mWSLri6maa	the 3rd one megaslicks, something peachy pinkish orangish its good for your skintone(:|`|vT4l2caVaa	I like to wear clear lip gloss or those light colored pink ones that juts leave a light shiny sheen on your lips because it looks more natural and my lips are already a pretty pink color|`|XsIPmFAaaa	well, considering the fact that your skin is a ligher tone, you definitely want to stay away from any bright colors. browns are too blah, purple makes people look dead, red is too distracting, and regular lipstick isn't glossy enough. you would look very nice in a pink. nothing too pale, but not too bright. however, darker shades of lipgloss/lipstick will make people's teeth look whiter. :) hope that helps!
gqopFVeyaa	Well, piercing with a gun automatically means you will be waiting longer to stretch. Once you are all healed and ready, you will need to buy the jewelry and tapers (get them as a set off ebay, it will be cheaper)    Once you have that, be prepared to a long process. Your ears were pierced at size 18g. The next size up will be 16g- this will be an easy stretch since it is so small. The sizes 14g and 12g are much the same- easy little stretches, with about a month of downtime to heal.     Now, 10g and beyond is a little harder, and will require longer waits. Wait two months when stretching from 12g to 10g and 10g to 8g. These will require a lubed taper, and might sting (but shouldn't hurt too bad, and should never bleed). 8g to 6g, 6g to 4g, and 4g to 2g, wait three months, and same deal with the taper. Then, 2g to 0g and 0g to 00g, wait four months. Anything bigger, you can wrap your jewelry in tape to gradually stretch, or wait even longer between stretches [even if you don't plan on going this big, I thought I would tell you]    PS. Please follow this, or at least close, as the repercussions are bad- think tearing, blowouts, or scar tissue, to say the least.|`|QAQHJFI9aa	No, that's too big of a jump. You need to go by 2's. 18, 16, 14, 12, etc.      And to the "Amb" person, at least learn how the sizes go before saying anything. A 00 isn't smaller than a 6. It's bigger.|`|fFqzD3aMaa	My brother gauged his out to 1.25" and had to get the flaps cut off, so be ready for a little surgery if you want to make them small again|`|smFjFknKaa	dont you have to slowly make the hole in your ear bigger??|`|bAYVSfdJaa	It's stretching first of all.  And the first rule of thumb is to never skip sizes. Skipping one size is bad,  skipping 7 is just idiotic.|`|capCtdkeaa	I had mine to 12mm and decided to take it out after about 3 years, it has closed up to jus a little hole that you dont notice unless i pull my lobe, so no probs with it here|`|e8f092bbd197b0b3bdad36d4e1287a01aa	no its sounds stupid|`|ys26TNwMaa	a 6 guage? no not right off the bat go to like a double 0 or something so if u end up not liking it, at least u can take it out and still look normal but w/ a six its just there and regretable|`|a7eE92RPaa	I'm not a big fan of gauging. To me it looks either really tacky or just plain gross. I'm a big fan of piercings, don't get me wrong, but I'm not into gauging.|`|EnAtAmHoaa	NOOOOOOO don't do that's it's too drastic a stretch, which is what's it's called "ear stretching"  you need to gradually work your way up to a 6 if you want to do it. the gauge size of the earring they used to Peirce your ear is probably an 18, you'll need to go to a 16, 14, 12, 10 etc you cannot just stretch 6 sizes.  use a taper to stretch you ears, a cone like looking thing, they come in different sizes and then put that size plug in until they aren't sore then the next size and the next and the next. stretching takes time and patience.      BTW a double zero is one of the biggest gauge sizes there they work backwards. don't listen to who ever said go to a double zero    and if you take proper care of your stretches ears they will shrink back. massage them and rub oils on them. but don't do it unless your sure you can live with it forever/want surgery    gauging is not a word, it's called stetching, a gauge is the measure of the diameter of the jewlery

KBSmcV9Laa	I'd take it as a good thing. It probably means its not obvious your wearing make up and as long as they aren't saying it sarcastically then its a compliment!|`|IAWZRnrAaa	It's a good thing. Though I think that guys would give you more compliments without make up - flawlessness is key.|`|p8GOUOShaa	I think its good......  If you're getting compliments then yeah.  Do you usually wear make up? Do they compliment you only when you wear make up or something?|`|dms7WyJVaa	ugh! duh its a good thing. ah-viously!|`|u1kB88CVaa	Depends on how much makeup. If you wear very little it's a good thing. If it's covering up things you are already aware of then you don't need to ask the question, you've answered it already.|`|ByR8wgFaaa	its a really good thing its like great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|8gWftZQpaa	GOOD THING...DUH|`|VN2wyTnFaa	Good thing! It means your makeup matches and looks good. A compliment is never a bad thing! LOL|`|972LCOk4aa	its a compliment so ofcourse its a good thing but its also bad in a way. you shouldnt hide your flaws though, if they found out it wasnt your real skin than they wouldnt like you very much.

2EvkFausaa	I don't know. But I don't find her attractive at all. She's way overrated, just like Paris Hilton|`|1FAakFh0aa	miley DOES look like a beaver!     jessica is hot!   http://blog.joins.com/usr/c/h/chaeleesbs...      try argue with that!|`|P5Yh0poBaa	jealous much? jessica alba's a ****** babe, and im a straight girl.|`|gWleYSuIaa	because she is|`|aV0QmAOtaa	I agree with you! I mean, she is talented and everything, but without makeup and some airbrush, she looks really regular to me. I would prefer my boyfriend picking some worthwhile like, Megan Fox for example. But to be honest, I just dislike Jessica's personality so much. Her family is Latino/Hispanic (her last name is Alba, duh) and just because she is first generation American (meaning she was born here) she doesn't consider herself Hispanic and denies her Latino roots. Personally, being half Hispanic myself, I take that as a slap to the face because i think it's sad that someone would deny their roots and disrespect your family's culture. I've also heard she's not the nicest person in the world, and she's very rude often, so.. yeah.|`|alRLh7yxaa	she's tanned obviously, pretty skin, dark eyes and hair...mostly its blonde hair and blue eyes...idk...she's naturally pretty.|`|XyOsRQvgaa	really? i do ^^ and she's really pretty without make-up too, like in into the blue? it looked like she had no make-up on in that. and she has a really nice body.|`|VmSKQ40Caa	You can not pinpoint the exact reason why they find her attractive.

I honestly think it is a trend. Trends just happen randomly like luck    But she does have a universal average facial appeal. And that universal average body everyone likes (slim not too skinny) and the universal height everyone seem to like (5'5-5'6)    People just seem to love averageness-- NO idea why.    P.S.

e56f34b226a134831834a176960b7128aa	Apply mousse that enhances curls. Then use a hair curler that is 350degrees (F) or hotter, and spray on hairspray. Also don;t touch your hair when you release it from the curling iron, let it cool down. After spraying your hair with hairspray, let the hairspray dry before you touch it.      here is a video that I liked.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBAJJyJZd...       (for curling hair)|`|kFkb6d53aa	I've heard if you curln your hair when its semi dirty that it stays better,and you can curl with curling irion and spray it  and then let it go!...Also there are hair products that helpn your hair curl.|`|iEjCmMMPaa	use hair spray, lots!   or you can scrunch you hair so it is curly/crunchy and it will stay that way throughout the day.|`|mvZTm2pjaa	get side bangs,   andc url ur hair or make it like a wavy kinda loose curl ;D    and..use hair spray and make it thinner pieces and hold it longer, ahhaah    andd...use black eyeliner, mascara, and a goldish bronze tan color eyeshadow  and a light neutral pink lip gloss   with some pinkish bronzer blush      andt hats a classy but casual look for u ^|`|EJL5QoDraa	u can get hair products that will help u curl ur hair, and when I curl my hair I have to blow dry it then when I am curling it I have to use a lot of hairspray thats the only way mine will stay in all day|`|ebQ4vuUnaa	Have you tried spraying it with hairspray before you use the curling iron or whatever type of tool you  use to curl it?

05ff5bb18eb4c096ef430ca99d7dad2daa	I am naturally pale as well and have a white topped flower on my shoulder. It's just fine. The white is still bright, touch ups were easy, the color really pops. As long as you take care of it as well as any other tattoo you will be fine. Sun screen, limited sun exposure, and not submerging it while healing. White is a great color but is hard to get even, like with black. Find a really good artist and they will know how to use it.|`|HS5ZSdd0aa	I just got a tattoo and I am super white.  I mean I supersede pale.  Yellow and white do not show up on me at all.  Yellow looks like I have foundation on that is one shade to dark and white you can't even see.  My suggest for use pale people is to stick with jewel tones.  Blues, greens, purples, reds, pinks, and then blacks and browns.    I say this because it would suck to have to get a tattoo retouched just after it finishes healing because the color did not take.|`|4keGomSTaa	idk but i think white tattoos are absolutely beautiful :]] i heard they loook nice on pale skin too so your in luckk :]]|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	I believe they have a tendency to go either a yellowy colour or a greyish colour over time, and they don't last forever. Talk to your tattooist, it may be the case that with a simple design you could get it touched up once a year or so without it being too detrimental to the work, I can't be sure!|`|pGF6Xdghaa	that might not look right after a while..  try tattoo airbrush first..  good luck|`|MV0lMuDMaa	white wont stay on for long it will be a waste.|`|goCkjhDzaa	I have one tattoo.

5af8PNwxaa	Don't know if you are shy...but if you are not, why don't you get professionally fitted.    Like dresses, jeans, etc not all manufacturers make the sizes the same.  Meaning even though you may be 34D in one brand, does not mean you are.    In large department stores, professional fitters in the bra departments measure you and tell you the right bra for what you want whether it be underwired, push up, strapless, etc.|`|ksZSL3Nwaa	A BOOST BRA I WOULD SAY THEY GIVE YOU ALL THE SUPPORT U NEED REALLY THERE FAB.|`|FB8MI8Llaa	water bra! watch out for corners tho! or a  pushup!

bItnTxBGaa	i'm a 14 year old girl also, so i know what you mean. i used to get pimples all the time. yeah, popping them is the worst thing you could do. Do not get bangs or other hair to cover them up!! the pimples with just get worse. they have to be able  to breathe or something. sounds funny, huh? i use face wash, mostly neutrogena and clean and clear DAILY. if i don't use it for like two days, i start breaking out all over again. the new line from clean and clear is really good. the soft scrub and the mask. especially the lotion! i use it every morning. it moisturizes but is not too oily. i love it! the neutrogena clear pore mask is also good. just make sure not to keep it on for over the recommended five minutes. personal experience. not good. i got all red and it didn't go away until almost two days. that's because i fell asleep with it. bad idea. and junk food makes it worse. but chocolate is fine. well, i guess that depends. it doesn't do anything to me. so yeah. just make sure to wash you face EVERY DAY!! i hope this helps. :)|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	See the question about shower loofahs. If you use one to exfoliate your face a couple of times a day - particularly just before going to bed, they are quite amazing at getting rid of acne. Also make sure you always sleep on fresh cotton pillow cases, never synthetic.|`|e1FnEHRpaa	Well first off stop squeezing your acne..it makes it even worse!! Second you should stick to one kind of product. It is bad to switch them around because your skin gets introduced to different chemicals everytime. I would recomment going to a beautician and having them clean your skin professionally. Maybe even visit a dermatologist.   Also things like steam rooms and saunas help skin because they open the pores and naturally remove the dirt and oil from it. Use the same product, visit a steam room, and moisturize!!!!! every night and day.   Hope this helps!
oX9hnJV1aa	OK Mike, here's a serious, no foul answer.....  Ditch the idea of doing another home made tattoo. As a matter of fact, ditch the idea of being a tattoo artist the way you are approaching it.  Go to a local tattoo shop and hang out. Pay for a little ink. Hang out some more. Find a place where you feel comfortable and get to know the people there.... work your way in to an apprenticeship.   Sure, you can do tats with a home made machine ( not gun), but the quality will never be quite as good as if you were using precision instruments and quality inks. But then you already know that from your posted question.  If you really have an interest in doing quality tattoos... you will find a legit way to get in to it. The other way leads to sub-standard work (no matter your abilities) , worries about who may have caught what at your hands , the health department comin after you...and last but not least your local municipality for working without permits and licenses.. tax evasion etc. If you are good enough at what you are doing.... people are gonna talk..that's how you get references for more work...and big fines if the wrong people learn of your talents.   Dude, dodge alotta bullets and do it the hard / right way. You will get alot more business as well as respect down the road that way. I understand how hard it is to break in to the trade. Be persistent.  Good luck.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Try invisible ink. I hear all the idiots love it.    PS. It's a tattoo MACHINE, by the way.    PPS. How much did you spend on the autoclave? Or wait, let me guess, you don't have one? Well... enjoy your Hepatitis! :-)        Honey, this IS a serious answer. What did you use to sterilise your equipment? It never ceases to amaze me the number of idiots who genuinely don't either realise or care about the reality of this. You won't be so flippant when you're in hospital, matey. Think it through. If you can't afford professional tattoos, get a better job. Everyone else manages it.|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	ugh......    http://www.jokertattoo.net/tattoo-ink-1/...

Just because you have some piercing doesn't MEAN you're gay. Somehow, this "rule" that if a male has only his right ear pierced, he's gay, was created, but it's complete foolishness. However, don't expect to avoid homosexual insults from peers. If you're interested in avoiding those (which I can understand), I suggest getting your other ear pierced. If we're not talking about ear piercings...well, then I've never heard of that for anything but ears.|`|fMfBAgOUaa	No, it does not. Thats just something stupid that little elementry/middle school kids made up when they begged their moms to let them get peircings for the first time...     Get them wherever you want. If someone doesnt like it, who cares.|`|st5reHVjaa	no  its just like in the old days it was a way to say that u were gay.  but it doesnt make u gay.

It means you wanted the right pierced instead of the left it doesn't make you gay. Sometimes people connect having piercings on the right with being gay but sometimes it's the left.  But does having it make you gay....i dunno do you feel like going out and dating members of your sex now that you have a piercing on the right?  Stupid question.|`|7c6bf2a89333b3e48583a9b2b10a3231aa	To the first answerer, your analogy makes NO sense at all.    It doesn't MEAN you're gay, but it is often used as a symbol for people to openly state they're homosexual. However, it's only if they do it on purpose. Just so happening to have one doesn't mean you ARE gay.|`|sqW4uRqdaa	No, people make up silly things like that just to anger people.|`|rS7Ggnslaa	depends... did you intend for this? are you gay? if not.... then no...|`|CcfMfP8zaa	i have no idea how ur mom could come up with that
lEmKvS50aa	Actually, I have multi colored tatts on my neck and a black sunflower that goes down my shoulder into a complete sleeve on my left arm.  My art work is amazing.  Now, as far as a job goes, my entire left side is tattooed from my neck down my arm and I work for a major real estate corporation.  The thing is, I'm a man and I'm required to wear a suit.  Therefore my shirt covers my neck tattoo and sleeve.  So, make sure you get the tattoo low enough that it can be covered by a button down if need be.|`|441GSyaMaa	Yes it will keep you from jobs. Even the military are cracking down on having tattoos (in visible places). So I'd be careful...|`|2UDbOpxTaa	Depends on what sort of jobs you're looking to go for, and also depends on your general appearance. If you scrub up well then I don't see why something small and neat should be a problem unless you're looking to be the queen's corgi polisher or something. Go for it, you only live once.|`|kCdISEGqaa	I won't do neck tattoos.  There are just certain parts of the body that should be left alone.  I am a heavily tattooed woman, but, I leave certain areas untouched, the neck being one of them.  A company can legally discriminate because of tattoos.  They can refuse to hire you based on that alone.  People have been fired because they get tattooed after getting their dream job, even with a great appraisal record.  I own a tattoo shop, and I wouldn't hire anyone with a neck tattoo, sounds weird, but we all have our standards.  I'm not into the extremist fad that's going on right now, but, that's just my opinion.|`|UMzd6FHWaa	Consider your career opportunities. Hand and neck tattoos are highly visible and except for your face is the most visible area you can get tattooed. If you work somewhere either now or in the future that requires body art to be covered during business hours, you'll be hard pressed to meet this requirement.|`|JRRsjByCaa	yeah, neck, and hand, or face tattoo's are not good for almost all people, unless you work a job where they dont care (eg. construction worker, tattoo/piercing specialist, etc.)<br>  and honestly, neck tattoo's mostly never look good.|`|AA12279950	Yes.|`|lEqKoRe5aa	it depends on how big the raven is and what kind of job you are going for. employers tend to steer clear of people with visible tattoos if they are going to be in a customer facing role. so if you just want to work eg in a call centre they probably wouldn't mind, but if you were going to be eg an estate agent, then they might not like it. you might be lucky if you can get it in a place where it can be covered by hair if needs be.|`|zh9Jjddvaa	Absolutely don't do it - you will definitely regret it in the future. I adore tattoos and have some myself but I would never get one in a place I could not easily hide, many employers are against them and there can be a stigma attached to the type of person that has one on their neck.|`|PBMg4OTMaa	Unfortunately it might affect your chances of getting jobs in the future. I really wanted one on my neck but my tattoo artist persuaded me out of it saying that I might not be able to get a job.<br>  Try having it somewhere that is easy to cover up.|`|wyAbkG3oaa	Get it somewhere you can cover it up. Nothing worse than women in a nice evening dress or wedding dress with tattoos showing.|`|c0be28b3edea48ead1b1905ccac2f3b6aa	Yes<br>  <br>  You'd regret it<br>  <br>  People would avoid you<br>  <br>  It'd look crap<br>  <br>  Youd' become a social pariah<br>  <br>  Trust me, don't do it...|`|uIg6an6Jaa	possably<br>  <br>  get it on your sholder blade<br>  <br>  that way it wont be very visable|`|e8aa8e418b72c63acc3e4ab908f8a79baa	yes|`|LYxCuCWhaa	This answer varies. It really depends on what type of jobs you'll be looking for because while some places welcome creativity and diversity, others will single you out in a negative way because of it.<br>  <br>  I have a few friends whose parents own business, and the trend (in my experience) is that the older the person you're asking to hire you, the more prejudice you're likely to encounter. My best friend's dad owns his own company and he talks all the time about how he'll never hire someone if he knows they have tattoos. Other friends of mine have fathers that say they won't hire tattooed people because it's not the "right image for the company". <br>  <br>  However, there are several cases where you should be okay. Just think carefully about your field and then make the decision right for you.|`|nFpOWZy5aa	Yes. You can't hide neck tattoos.

nv0nIj3Daa	you're 14 and you're thinking about getting your lip and belly pierced? Whooo! don't even TRY to pull that kind of bull, when especially when you're so young.|`|gqopFVeyaa	Alright, well first, I think you night to expand your plans a bit. The ears are reasonable when you are fourteen- I was thirteen when I had mine done. But I would say that you should put some more time between your further piercing plans. Say, lip when you are sixteen or seventeen, not fifteen.     That said, for the here and now, here is how you should approach your parents: like an adult. Especially if you act immature, the best thing you can do is keep your cool and approach them as an adult.     First, suggest the idea, idly. Like, if you are watching TV and see a girl with pierced ears and cute earrings, say, "wow, look at how cute her ears are. Can I get mine done sometime?" If they say no, you can ask why, but whatever the answer is (especially if it is something dumb, like, because I said so), just nod and drop the subject by saying, "Well, at least think about it", or the like.     Now that you have established that you want them done, it is time to get informed. Gather any and all information you can. You should know the pros and cons of ear piercing methods (guns vs. needles- needles are preferable. If you don't know why this is, go look it up), what kind of aftercare you need and why (sea salt soaks, as they clean your ears and draw infection out due to osmosis in a hypertonic solution) what the risks are (infection, scar tissue, etc.), where you would get it done (definitely a tattoo place with a good reputation). Even go so far as to make a case on why ear piercing is acceptable in society (who has it, what are the attitudes towards it, employers, etc). If necessary, save up for it yourself.     Next, plan on why you are mature enough for this. Will you regret this, and if so, what will you do about it? Will you be able to do the appropriate aftercare (and if you have a history of not being mature, change, demonstrate you can handle something like this)    Now, present the argument. Begin the conversation in a mature way, like, "Mom, remember when you said no to getting my ears pierced? Well, I would like you to reconsider, and here's why." Present the information in a calm and pleasant why. Tell her that you have done lots of research, talked to professionals, and have it all planned. Tell her what you have found about the process, the health aspects, what society thinks, etc. Then make the argument for yourself, about your ability to handle it.     No matter what she says, you can not get upset, whiny, loud, argumentative, or immature. Doing so will kill the argument. Answer reasonably, ask her to explain herself. If she gives annoying parent answers (because I said so, etc), tell her you are trying to approach her on a mature level and would appreciate if she did, too.     Now, if this works the first time, great! If she still says no, don't push her. This is where bargaining comes in. Point out that your actions show you really want this, and you are willing to trade it. For example, good grades, for a birthday, in exchange for better chores, etc. At least get her open to the idea of trade. And then, don't go back on it! You will have to earn it. And no matter how long it takes, don't be immature about the argument- parents do not appreciate this.     Eventually she will give in, even if it takes a long time. Then, after you have them done, don't mention anything further until way after your ears heal. Then, suggest the idea of more holes casually. She will probably react with, you just got one, don't push it. So, repeat steps, with gathering information, then having a talk, waiting her out, bargaining, etc. Do this for the third set of holes, too.     For cartilage piercings, she might be more resistant. Be honest with the information about pain, healing, etc, but point out that it is still culturally acceptable. This may take longer to swing, but it is possible, with planning, patience, and mature talking.     As for gauging, I would first gather ALL information. Become an expert. Then, I would not even tell her what you are doing at all. I would save up (birthday, holidays, loose change, etc) and buy the hoop earrings- the same style you were pierced at, most likely- all the way up to 12g, because they are hard to notice stretching in. Then, for 10g and farther, buy decorative earrings, not plugs. The ornate spirals, twists, hoops, etc, will hide stretching. Mine are 8g now, and I wear spiraling hoops, and you can not really tell they are stretched unless you are paying attention. If she asks, you can decide whether to be honest (at the risk you will be told to take them out)  or lie (at the risk you will be caught in the lie). If it comes down to it, inform her gently, and hope.     As for piercing your lip and eyebrow, that seems a bit out of reach. Wait until you are older (sixteen/seventeen or older) and have won her over about your ears. If she is an easy sell, you can try, using the steps above, for each, but if she is not, don't push your luck until you are older and can really a|`|kh5ZHIeuaa	Just keep asking your parents and than 1 day if they keep saying no just go to the place and get your piercingand its like if you rally hate the ppiercingthan you could just keep it out and the skin would grow back.

None of us know your parents and the extremes they might go to to punish you for getting piercings without their permission, so yes, it is best to get that from them. But ear piercings? That's just so commonplace now that I'm shocked they'd say no. My father HATES piercings. He's let me get my lobes, my anti-eyebrow, and my upper lip (twice) but I had to bug the **** out of him about it. I'm going to be doing snakebites myself soon as well (with proper equipment and a lot of research).     In this case, I think it's pretty ridiculous that they won't let you get your EARS pierced. What I would do is bug them about it and if it seems to be a definite no, go and get them done with a friend's mom or something and then hide them with clear studs and hair (I'm hoping your hair covers them.

AA10077147	I went to a dermatologist. He perscribed DIFFERIN, BENZCLIN, and DORYX. My skin is so smooth now it's not even funny. I only used doryx for a couple of months because it is a very strong pill, but it gave me lasting results. Now I don't even need any prescriptions. I use CETAPHIL face wash. It's ph balanced for sensitive skin & my dermatologist recommended it. I use a couple of organic toners to keep my skin in check now. The first one is just USDA certified organic green tea that has been chilled. I use this one in the morning under some CETAPHIL spf 15 lotion and it's very refreshing. The other toner is just one part apple cider vinegar to eight parts purified water. They are both full of antioxidants & the vinegar has a lot of alpha hydroxy acids which help quite a bit. You can also use the apple cider vinegar as a spot treatment without mixing it with water. Tea tree oil is also a good spot treatment. Also, make sure that anything you put on your face says "oil-free, non-comodogenic, non-irritating, or/and fragrance-free" And you should grow out your bangs. I had the same problem areas until I grew mine out. Oh & change your pillow cases as often as you can. You'd be surprised how much of a difference a clean pillow can make. Good luck! Hope this helps.|`|TiUfiuEoaa	It is important to keep spot-prone areas clean, so wash the affected area twice a day with a perfume-free cleanser. Do bear in mind that the skin needs a certain amount of oil to maintain its natural condition. Therefore, avoid washing your face many times, that too, with a strong soap. I would recommend Cetaphil and Neutrogena face washes as they are mild and good for cleaning acne-affected skin.  Tea tree oil is considered to be a good anti-acne agent. Sandalwood paste and Fullers earth (multani mitti) are also used by some to dry out the excessive oil.

TDFTZcjYaa	i'm not sure what it's called, but if you take a picture of her to your hairdresser they'll know how to do it.    also, you can dress in kind of a quirky fashionable kind of way. wear clothes that make you look petite, like dark skinny jeans, and wear unusual tops that resemble designer clothes. Wear tight and light colored clothes.    the way you walk also is a big part too. try to be lighter on your feet, very graceful. don't wear heavy shoes. flats are the most suitable for this. they make it easier to walk lightly. walk on the balls of your feet, and think of how ballet dancers dance. that's how you would want to walk. keep good posture as well.    if you do these steps you should be as strikingly beautiful as alice in no time. :)    you don't have to be a vampire to be gorgeous. =)|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	*face palm*|`|e6zJFfd8aa	you sound like taylor... *puts finger on head and thinks* i wonder|`|9bqtCqgDaa	not sure what it called, but get a  pic of alice and show ur hairdresser .|`|rHCVpXw9aa	um, you can just take a pic of alice to a hair cutting salon, and they can cut it like the picture. thats what my friend did, and it wrked.

VN2wyTnFaa	I definitely wouldn't wear them for 4-5 weeks straight, and the Duo lash adhesive is absolutely perfect. You can actually get Duo plenty of places, not just MAC. I got mine from Ulta.

QK2b6Ozuaa	I don't live in Chicago, IL but i can give you some good advice, find places in your area, go there and check the place out. make sure they answer all your questions.  you should be looking for a place that is clean, comfortable, and friendly.  questions you should be asking are....    do they use a needle or a gun for cartilage. they should do the piercing with a needle.    how do they sterilize their equipment? there are many ways to do this, most common is an autocave which if i remember correctly uses heat & steam, if they do not have one ask how they do things.     when you get the piercing they should open *sterile* tools in front of you. they should explain aftercare of the piercing & give you a sheet of instructions.    as long as they are comfortable, friendly & knowledgable & answer all your questions it is a good reputable place.|`|WY9wxqzAaa	not clairs! i got mine done there and they messed it up!!! just a local place should work. local buissnesses need as much customors as they can get in this economy!!|`|csuWY67uaa	Piercing Pagoda.

They use piercing guns which can shatter or collapse your cartilage. If you really want a cartilage piercing go to a professional. I suggest going to a tattoo and piercing studio or parlor, it does not hurt and it is safer to pierce your cartilage with a needle than a gun.    I'm having industrial done at Ink Inc. I live in Texas but here is the link check it out and see if you can find a place like this. (:  http://inkincstudio.com/default.aspx

10de9a875cf94a4ef7d681f8c14dd791aa	Try Mane'n'Tail products.  I always recommend that because I worked at Sally's for a while and a lot of people bought the shampoos and conditioners, so I decided to try them out too.  I noticed a difference right away!|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Not only orange juice you can try and include a few of these food in your diet to make your hair grow fast.

It worked for me|`|KVlaTr9maa	main and tail works, so i have heard...  but im a girly, so i know all about the home way.  m'kay, massaging you head makes hair grow fast, so does brushing because the movement stimulates hair growth. when you cut your hair, it also stimulates hair growth, because just like when you scratch your skin all of the cells are trying to rebuild it. and one last thing...  wow ur parents are REAL jerks.

Box colors are primarily made from metallic salts, which are very harsh on the hair, and also, they are a one-type fits all, and are not formulated for individuals.
Z1PqMi0zaa	one thing you must know about proactive is that it makes your skin go through a process called purging- this means that after about one month- 8 weeks of starting the treatment, you WILL experiance a BIG breakout- which is good, its your skin releasing all the toxins at once.    trust me, I experianced it, start it NOW so that you wont have that nasty breakout on the first day...    I made the same mistake.|`|DLbracM5aa	Do it now to get clear skin ASAP, why wait ?|`|2tH7jIZdaa	i wouldnt recommend it. ud b beter off with a better skin regimne. Try masks weekly they help. and exfoliators. and a mild cleansing gel, i use spectrogel. proactive has bp which dries your skin up so much that it is possible to cause a more pimples altho ppl would say to use moisturizer which i guess u should if u make up your mind on using it but keep in mind that once u use it u cant stop using it or u migh breakout again. u have to stick with it even after your skin clears up.|`|a6hQftotaa	now, you'll have a fresh look when you walk the those high school doors.|`|Uc96X3T3aa	RIGHT NOW!|`|BUAsTM0faa	dont try over the summer! skin is way better over the summer cause the sun actually helps acne and the humidity moisturizes skin. it wont be accurate for winter or any other season. i would recommend trying it now so you know what it does to your skin first, like if you have a bad reaction or something, just in case
sBgCUQWzaa	omg neutrogena micro mist tan. its awesome! even color and color appears in less than 2 hours!!!!|`|claW4UUcaa	i forgot the brand but it's sublime tan. make sure you exfoliate really well beforehand. mix your sunless tanner with some plain white unscented lotion. like jergens. don't use the gloves. it makes streaks. wash your hands asap so they don't turn orange. i used my hair dryer on cool to help dry faster.|`|WziIW0lIaa	I like Jergen's Natural Glow--- or whatever it's called.    I use it because spray tans aren't for me. *says the girl with bad experiences*|`|3a3ZTMWDaa	I've tried a BUNCH of them and the best one I've found is the one by Bare Escentuals. It's in the white bottle called Faux Tan. When you pump it out, it looks a little green, but don't worry. It goes on and doesn't smell bad (a major annoyance of other ones) and it goes into your skin and doesn't rub on off your clothes/sheets as much as others do. It gives a very nice non-orange color that lasts a good while.|`|nG5cKoK6aa	Hello.    When I want to have a nice tan that looks really and doesn't make my skin turn orange or rub off on my clothes is Neutrogena Sun Fresh Sunless Tanner. This works amazing. I used this last year right before prom and I had a flawless tan that lasted for 5 days. The more you use this the better you skin will start to look and feel. Bonus you don't have to worry about skin cancer as much as if you were going to a tanning bed. The only down side with this when you go to apply it you have to leave it on for an hour then shower the rest off. I really hope this helps you out.|`|H331wkQdaa	um i dont tan but lots of my friends do an some tan in the bed an sometimes they burn alot an the other ones ues  spry an it doesnt all ways rub off an u cant get it in different tones

JMs4RDVxaa	It's not the most dangerous, there are other piercings out there that are way more risky. But don't do it yourself, go to a highly recommended piercing place, and make sure the person doing the piercing knows what he or she is doing. There's always the risk of hitting a vein or nerve, but if the piercer is experienced, it shouldn't be a problem.<br>  <br>  I think you should go for it, tongue piercings look so cute!|`|zlXofrG4aa	The most dangerous piercing is the kind done by an unprofessional, unprepared person.<br>  If the person has the qualifications and proper equipment, at a piercing parlor, then you have no worries.<br>  <br>  Anything can be most dangerous if it's done by the wrong people.|`|seMXuWwxaa	No, I don't think you should risk it.  Over all, it is not going to improve your appearance at all, why should you?  The health risks far outweigh the benefit you are going to get from having a piercing in your tongue.

She had to go for a surgery to stitch the pierced area coz the wound was causing her tongue to be infected.
jUGuElKlaa	From the brands you've described, I assume you dress in a style similar to prep or to classic.  I suggest trying:    Gap  Heritage 1981  Levi's  American Eagle (not prep, just plain American youngster)  Express  Polo Ralph Lauren|`|e2J4r10Raa	levis, lee, nautica, docker are always good. or anything from kohls that place is awesome when it comes to sales.|`|5ecd52a3e38827f0b59290da8be919dcaa	american eagle, abercrombie, hollister, aeropostale, pacsun|`|uFBXM4rIaa	keep the levis and nautica.  add adidas, nike, ben sherman, penguin, anything from urban outfitters, american apparel, nordstroms.    i would advise you to stay away from mainstream preppy brands like abercrombie, hco, american eagle, aeropostale.|`|62N5DC8qaa	Sideout seems to be a popular type for kids , altho' my kid's more into element and DC , yes these are expsensive but if you can find a resale shop called  "  PLAYTOS CLOSIT" then you could find many gently used clohes that the teens and kids love to wear but cost so much in other stores, i have found the brands that my kid loves for as little as $ 7.00 an item in good condition and he doesent care that they are used .....other then that shop resale shops anytime you can that is my advice to anyone who want's to shop and save ...|`|i9SZlhI2aa	America Eagle makes really good clothes, quality and looks.|`|PsQFasl4aa	hollister. ambercrombie and fitch. jimmy z's its not about the brand .. its how the clothes look|`|fLAxBDECaa	anything from urban outfitters or american apparel.

It will not make them grow and will have the opposite effect on them. You would also cause premature aging around the eye area. A single eyelash takes 9 months to regrow, a single one. So be careful. Never use waterproof mascera it will crack your eyelashes in half, make sure that when you do use a makeup remover it does not contain any mineral oil or alcohol. This problem can be helped by using Dermalogica makeup remover, it helps add vitamins and proteins to the lashes. What you really need to focus on, is what you are digesting into your system. Make sure you are getting enough vitamins, if not take a daily one. Also you may want to go to the health food store and pick up a product called Silica. It's like a liquid and you take a tablespoon of it. It has extra proteins and people report having stronger, healthier hairgrowth. Apart from that you'll get a whole lot of other benefits|`|pDAapTvDaa	i accidentally cut mine once and they grew back longer within a couple of weeks.|`|vyNe8eqDaa	my step mom ripped her eye lashes off by a eye lash curler by accedent lmao and they did grow back ahha so i have proff  they do =]    hope that helped|`|rcds1PBAaa	no dont trim them they won't grow back belive me my friend cut hers by accident and they didnt grow back. reli dont do it|`|YRcgUOBjaa	don't cut your eyelashes. long eyelashes are the prettiest thing ever when they a short you have to use a bunch of mascara to make them long when they are probably are long now.|`|z6sTfQ0Qaa	hm why would you want less eyelashes?   the more the better the thicker the better!    but if you must they will grow back!    so will eyebrows|`|H6I0vEoWaa	Ew , don't that is soo unattractive gross !|`|claW4UUcaa	i wouldn't do it. if something were to happen that's not something you can easily hide.|`|qEsas2Ssaa	You can do it....they will grow back longer!|`|s1oDY9Tfaa	Oh my goodness, why would you ever want to cut them!

But why on earth would you want to cut them?  Women everywhere spend a fortune on mascara and fake lashes so they look longer.    If you cut them it'll probably look silly and do you really want to put scissors so close to your eyes.    I've never heard of someone wanting shorter lashes...|`|CZwJJetyaa	Cutting your eyelashes is not a good idea. You want them thicker try some mascara that adds volume and length.|`|pIBOSkfsaa	no don't do that, eye lashes are not like that, the reason your hair on head will grow faster after a trim is because all the dead, split ends are removed making it healthier, your eye lashes do not have split ends, sure they will grow back if you trim them but not thicker or longer, just use a good mascara or false lashes.|`|59xQlCjGaa	Yeah. That's what my mom (curses) did to me when I was little.    But don't do it! You'll end up looking like a maniac with no eyelashes!|`|XG4TAjcCaa	They won't grow back :)  don't do that, please.

iHBR5x83aa	Well, I used to ALWAYS bite my nails. There is this nail polish that my mother made me wear, its clear and you can get it at a pharmacy. I used the one called Control it, and it makes your nails nard and so sour its just disgusting to bite them. Another product my friend used was "Nibble no more"  You could also just always paint them and keep them perfect that way, sometimes that helps :)|`|FVNo0vZfaa	well  there is this clear nail polish at Walmart called    "Stop The Habit Stop The Bite"    im pretty sure thats what its called i used it and it helped a lot!                                                          Hope I Helped!!! :)|`|S4gKPOBOaa	mix hot pepper with finger nail polish dab your finger and and nail with it. you will stop or burn your toung off.|`|yPrqB4xfaa	Soak your fingertips in something you don't like.  Like Vinegar  or something it will leave a bad taste on your fingertips and you won't want to bite your nails anymore  but make sure it's something you DON'T like    hope i helped  =)|`|VZFEB85Iaa	I used to do that when I was 4.  I stopped at around.. 10 i think.  However, I peel my nails.  I hate clipping them.  It annoys me for some reason lol.  Then afterwards, I file my nails and then it becomes nice and smooth.  And how I stopped was easy. Will power.  I knew it was kind of weird.. to bite my nails so I just stopped.  Everytime I felt like biting my nails, I sat on my hands and watched TV.|`|YwUvfCTeaa	This was a hard habit for me to break, it took me three different tries to finally get this, i tried nail polish first, that didnt really work... so next i tried bandaids, they kept falling off... so i finally tried a stress ball and kept it with me at all times, and i would pull it out of my pocket every time i got bored, so eventually my stress almost went away and my friends noticed a difference in my attitude (in a good way) and i had better nails too...|`|uQNInPUXaa	I used to bite my nails too.   My mom told me to just keep going one at a time. And that it takes about 30 days to break a bad habit. Maybe you can have someone follow you and when you are about to bite a nail... make them yell at you. About a month later, the habit was just gone. I couldn't bite them anymore. (And now i got braces so it would be really hard to bite them anyways.|`|k2O7M9O2aa	i used to do that ALL the time. if u paint you nails u probably will stop because it chips at it and the chips will get into your mouth and it wouldnt taste so good. haha. try it out :) hope that helps!!! :D|`|ANUqRzWQaa	think about when u do bite ur nails...how horibble it will look...and when u do bite ur nails try biting ur tounge but not to hard thats wat i did...hope it helps|`|sZUNC9Ghaa	ive stopped and here is my method: stop biting one nail at a time. and then 2 nails, then 3, and until you stop completely. u will see ur nails growing and it will motivate u even more. hope this helps|`|7laNYydNaa	ok we are alike in that department uhm I guess there is this nail polish stuff it goes on clear and when you bite your nails it leaves a sour taste in your mouth,I have no clue what it is called but you can get it at a Drug store like Rite Aid,Walgreens,I'm sure Wal-mart has it if you looked maybe even Dollar General or Family Dollar,that and protect 1 nail at a time like your pinky..if you wanna bite your nails do it on the one your NOT protecting|`|dsKglEq5aa	idk??    I have ever since I new I could and I still doo!
ndhMSw8aaa	first of all i wouldnt recommend doing it agen  guys shouldnt wax  2nd it will go away after an hour or so  u shouldve put talcum powder on first and baby oil after|`|9rQzQxexaa	thats happened to me before. its like something underneath your skin or something. but it will go away, in like a day or so. it only hurts for like a day or so. put some moisturizer on it, like aveeno lotion, and try not to think about it. its really nothing.|`|kdMM7OAaaa	really all it is is you pulling your hair by the roots out and it will get irritated. stop waxing and do something that doesn't involve pulling your hair to get rid of it. some girl at my school waxes her eyebrows and she looks like she got electrocuted. dont worry it will go away but it may take a while|`|VKZw1rnqaa	irritation.    and guys should have hair there....|`|wq9qCs2Gaa	you probably shouldnt have shaved that hair, put to make the red dots go away rub baby powder on it for a while before you go to bed.|`|A0tWlG94aa	dont worry this is normal  dont have any hot showers and dont use deodrant for another 24 hours
VN2wyTnFaa	I'm black and hispanic and I've used those products. Pink Luster is okay, but I feel like it leaves my hair feeling sort of greasy. If you're looking for something to put on your hair whenever it's feeling dry, I actually like castor oil. The one I have comes in a jar and has a consistency like vaseline or something, but it doesn't leave that gross greasy feeling. If you're looking for something that you can blow dry into your hair, I'd go for either a leave-in conditioner or a product that I really love from a company Bio-Silk. Just the moisturizer. I'm not a fan of the shampoos or anything else though. Hope that helped!|`|jfiF9XIUaa	They are actually saying that Luster Pink Oil is bad for the hair especially for African Americans (from experience it has broken my hair off) I actually just started using Elasta QP and i'm going to the beauty supply to get some more.
egsqlA96aa	there's some kind of spray that freezes up the moles and they fell off your skin don't know how is called though (I'm totally sure it exist)but ask for it in a drug store or something is not expensive btw.  good luck anyway if that doesn't work out try the laser treatment|`|1bwLBV2aaa	there is laser treatment|`|QA3qpa2jaa	If you want a natural, at-home, inexpensive method, try this website, it worked for me:    http://www.earthclinic.com/CURES/moles.h...    Good luck!
DIxbib1paa	Id say 2 - 3 hours, costing 150 - 170 or $213 - $242|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	All artists work at different speeds, I would imagine on average 2-3 hours due to the amount of filling in. Most artists charge by the hour, my artist charges 60 an hour (which I believe would have been around $120 before the economy went kaput and the exchange rates all bollocksed up!), in which case around 120-180. I'm not usually a fan of tribal but that's not too bad actually! :-)      And richard... who the hell are you? You post the oddest answers. One minute you're perving on about breasts and butts, the next you're reeling off a load of judgemental nonsense. What business of yours is it what tattoo this guy gets? It's not like he's on here saying he's 14 and we have a duty to try and talk him out of it... nor is he on here saying he wants a swastika or something equally ridiculous... he didn't even ask for an opinion! How do you know he doesn't have ancestral tribal roots? How do you know what makes women tick? Personally, I'd prefer a guy with a bit of tribal than a guy who talks out his ar$e all day long like you! Seriously, you're an annoying weirdo - what's up with DAT?!?!|`|84a92b794a6ae292684ad41ae82b80b4aa	10 points please . I am 52 with 3 grown daughters / woman   18 24 25 yrs old. Raised in the 70s Rock n Roll shall never die.   Have 4 tattoos of my own. My opinion is  ( try to hear at least   some of what I am saying please ) Tribal is not KOOL !!!!!!!  A woman not a girl will ever think you are real man .  If asked what tribe do you belong too , Your answer is ???????  Such a gay part of a guys body What's up with DAT ??   A tattoo tells the world who U R & what you are saying.   Please first learn the reason for a tattoo|`|BCD8FaxPaa	prob about 100 pounds and take an hour or two.|`|jeHTjvbaaa	Well my tribal on my arm was $150 and took almost two hours.. so I'm gonna estimate around $300-$600.  Best bet is to go to different shops, one shop wanted to charge me $250 for mine..|`|LEHFUGUhaa	Depending on if your getting that exact tat... if you are it will be spendy. I have a tribal with a wolf head coming out of it on my forearm and it was $150 n took around n hour..... a tat of that size in that pic and color will run anywhere from $250 up too $1,000 depending on the artist you go too.... length wise a tat like that may take 2 sessions one for the outline and one for the color in part both sessions probably could be anywhere from 2 to 5 hours. Price and time all depend on how big the tat is, the tat artist and the detail of the tat.Hope that gives some perspective.|`|M9DWMQijaa	Just call a local tattoo parlor and they will tell u an estimate
PnJYGIneaa	I have one word for you   "Cetaphil"  This product is recommended by deretoligists, and is very helpful.  So before she goes to sleep Tell her to;  1. Wash her facewith water  2. Only 1 Pump of Cetaphil on her hand, and gently rub it in cirlces all over her face.  3. Wash it off with water  4. Dry it with a towel, but tell her to gently pat it to her skin, she may leave it a little damp  5. Then tell her to put on some "non-scented lotion" all around her face    And do the same routine you did here in the morning, and repeat it everyday and I guarentee you that her face will start to clear up, and look nicer, and brighter.    P.S.  You can buy Cetaphil at any drugstore|`|QEPb6sjRaa	Some products claim to help . But they always dont.  In that case you can try this ..

I Hope it helps! :)|`|LnzUMUCdaa	get a prescription from the docter i forgot what i got from mine but it worked good in a few weeks but i didnt have acne just small barely noticiable bumps|`|CcXIbqnOaa	Take her to a dermatologist. Over-the-counter medications are usually only made for one specific type of acne problem, and until you find out exactly what the problem is, you can't treat it.|`|AA10250756	You need to take her to a dermatologist and get her on retin A. I did that for my daughters. That's what works|`|6Apou72oaa	Yeah, she'll have to start eating healthier, for starters.  Get rid of the fries and pizza.  Both are high in fat and will contribute to acne.  Or if she really can't stop eating fries, go for the McCains fries that you bake, and look for a variety that is low in fat.  If she doesn't want acne, she will have to make that decision.  At least she only drinks water.  That's healthy.|`|lxYWZc9caa	If anything, you should take her to see a Dermatologist. They know a lot more than most people on Y!A|`|iEdubUyzaa	im not an expertt, but i use clean and clear persa gel. it comes in a little white tube. you can buy it anywhere and it dries up your skin and take away acne. it makes ur skin REALLY dry if you use a lot on, but its worth it. just get curel lotion bc those lotions are oil free so you can keep your skin less flaky with using it. it works for me. it doesn't take it ALL away yakno? but it keeps it under control and if you keep using it daily, it will really help and if you keep up with it, it can clear up your skin all the way.  but if her acne is like, to the extreme try seeing a doctor for pills that will help.  &&if you do try to use clean and clear, make sure you dont put it on in the morning, bc ..for example..if you use it for your back, and it gets on ur shirt, it will fade ur shirt and you dont want that to happen. i learned the hard way haha.  i also use neutrogena. [cant spell :P] and i use that to wash my face, adn then i put the clean and clear on afterwards before i go to bed. it works well for my skin    sry if that was too long, and i hope this help[=   goodluck|`|EkrGID8gaa	yes actually there is, first she really really needs to cut back on pizza, fries, etc., water should be helping but putting greasy food in your body is just going to make more acne. I remember my best friend had a real acne problem, and in time there were disapearing, she said that she would boil a small pot of water and drench the a clean cloth in the water, spring it, and place it on her face repeatly, not  to hot on her face, you dont want to burn. She would do this every nite. Of course there are other options, you can buy her Pro-Active. Well hope this helps!|`|pcoa5zH2aa	Well if she ate food more healthy that would help, too.  And she should try this:  1. pick a section of zits  2. squeeze them until they are flat (it wont hurt that much)  3. wash face with acne cleaner  4.  apply astringent (it will sting.  that means its working)    do this to your other sections of zits, too.  but not in the same day.  it takes a while for acne to clear up.  if this doesnt help go to a doctor.    I hope this helps a lot,  -Meg ????|`|2600f7cc53939f3eefa5406bdc841761aa	Salam, my father always used garlic when he was young but that does not smell very well.  Proactive acutally helps and the doctor will probably give you the best thing.  But I remember my sister had it bad all over her back and we had to put a prescription cream on her every day and then it went away.  It really takes time and you need to make sure you use it as directed.  She also used the sun but that can be dangerous now days.|`|7aqcathsaa	One thing is that the greasy foods are probably getting to her, and it can make her face more oily as well. I suggest that she washes her face every morning and night, with a simple unscented Dove bar of soap. (:|`|EB9uUa75aa	Go to a skin doctor and get a prescription. My bf had acne covering his face chest and upper back. It was so bad he was in pain.

I've noticed that really greasy foods mess your face up pretty bad. Make her eat lots of veggies and fruits, vitamins. Have her keep her face dry at night no oils. Oily faces are good for acne. also the best thing is to go to the doctor they'll know what is good for her skin type. since we all have different skin. Yeah i hope you get the help you need inshallah.|`|HRvPoQzKaa	No type of food will contribute to acne. That is just a myth. Do your research.    Anyways, take her to a dermatologist.|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	Her diet does not sound very good, but that is NOT the reason for her bad skin.  It has been scientifically PROVEN THAT DIET DOES NOT EFFECT THE SKIN) Hormones,genetics, clogged pores and her oily skin are. Can you take her to the Dr. and let him evaluate her or you can try these cleansing tips for problem skin.  1. Wash face and affected areas with DOVE cleansing bar, 2x a day.  2. Use witch hazel after as light astringent  (Too much alcohol will dry out the skin and make the sebaceous/oil glands work overtime, believe it or not)  3.Drinking water is a good idea, let her continue that.  4.Try Clearasil Ultra Vanishing Acne Treatment Cream...my son had a problem with his skin and it really helped.  5. Make sure she does not try to pop her blemishes and keeps her hands off her face, too  It will take about a week(maybe less) before signs of improvement show, but they will. You are a good Mom trying help your daughter with her skin. Hope it works for her.|`|TrPySdXFaa	U SHOULD TAKE HER 2 DA DOCTOR AND GET A PRESCRIPTION

zpovg4U7aa	you should wear a primer, which is like white mascara but it protects your lashes and makes them stronger. and then apply mascara.|`|usxeet5vaa	It depends on the brand you buy.  Cheap brands are probably horrible, but your eyelashes won't fall out!!!  You should probably get something from Ulta. They're pretty good.|`|J3rdyzNsaa	if you have thick and long lashes then theres no point!! but if you still want to curl them try a eyelash curler instead you can get them from cvs, walgreens, walmart, or anywhere else|`|UKtZS3Wraa	nooo, a lot of mascaras actually make your eyelashes grow and strengthens them. and to remove mascara, you should get some Eye Makeup Remover (they sell it at ur local drug store), dab some on a q-tip, and gently rub it off ur eyelashes.|`|yop2DPYvaa	no not at all, i started wearing makeup in grade 6! just make sure you wash ur makeup especially your mascara off at night...it can dry ur lashes out and make them brittle which can break the lash.|`|9J4PbcIGaa	I don't think it will damage them at all as long as you take your makeup off every night. It's when people dont' take it off that they start damaging their skin. You can buy eye make-up remover that will take the mascara right off.|`|YbO7D6axaa	Actually, most mascaras are good for your eyelashes. Especially Almay's One Coat Nourishing Mascara. It's got botanicals in it that help the lashes stay strong and helps them to not fall out. So no, your eyelashes won't fall out. LOL. And use an eye makeup remover, Olay and Neutrogena sell it (drugstores). And NEVER scrub your eyes to get it off. That WILL damage your lashes and the skin on/around your eyes.|`|QlzFoBS3aa	Not as long as you "gently" remove it each night.|`|aKvxy3xBaa	No. your lashes won't fall out FROM mascara, but you lashes do fall out on their own about every 6-8 weeks. You need to get a make up remover to take it off. I have tried several and I love Avon eye make up remover. Plus you don't want to rub around your eyes, its not good for when you get older, you don't want wrinkles.|`|n3CVPXrVaa	YES...Get one that conditions|`|VRlhfsfeaa	You shouldn't have a problem but if u r afraid don't use waterproof mascara and if you want 2 curl them put the mascara on AFTER u curl them or they will break. Hope I helped! =D|`|Jh0yyYizaa	No, mascara doesn't damage your eyelashes unless its waterproof and you wear it everyday without every taking it off.   I'm 15 and have been wearing mascara since year 8 (which wasn't last year but the year before).   Put vaseline on your lashes at night to make them stronger.     Trust me, if mascara damaged your lashes, nobody would wear it.|`|BUAsTM0faa	it doesnt do that. im 15 too and i use neutrogena volume, and it makes my eyelashes softer, and you dont even need to use makeup remover cause it washes off, but doesnt smear at all|`|VL4mOxbzaa	If you have naturally long eyelashes, you probually wont neped makeu|`|bpxd9cyLaa	i'm 15 and i've worn it to school for ages.  mine haven't fallen out yet.  neither have anyone elses you see wearing it.  it's fine :D  getting the mascara off?  i use soap and water when i can be bothered to.|`|fGSI183haa	mascara was actually only made for older woman who ha very few eyelashesor really thin ones. For younger girls, the eyelashes do fall out but not at once. and they are like hair, they grow back VERY SLOWLY and without noticing them. as almost all girls these days we all wear mascara. so dont worry. if u want to u can, it wont hurt u at all. but why would u want to wear mascara if u have long thick lashes anyways? girls would kill to have those.|`|alDqf8DAaa	No, unless of coarse you use really cheap mascara. So use really good quality mascara, and also if you already have nice eye lashes then you really don't need to use it.    And as for taking it off, buy some makeup remover.  I use Lancome eye makeup remover and it's like an oil base and it takes it off like that!    Also some good mascaras are Bad Gal from Saphora, or Chanel by Chanel.    hope i helped!|`|UxpRkWnkaa	nope|`|4a7f262367ce439921ed41cf674ac9e8aa	Mascara is such an amazing make-up tool to have. Mascara and a tinted lip gloss is a great start for a new make-up wearer. Never wear a water-proof mascara. It is very drying and will break your lashes in different points. If you can find a conditioning mascara, choose it because you won't experience any breakage. To remove mascara properly, either use eye make-up remover or just regular baby oil. Good Luck!!!|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	it'll be fine...get some Mabelline eye makeup remover (not for WATERPROOF mascara..) the bottle is small clear/white with a blue top...look at the bottom of the Mabelline rack. Use cotton balls...then wipe with water after you clean the mascara off.|`|aV0QmAOtaa	It won't damage your eyelashes if you remove it at the end of the day. Makeup won't hurt your skin or damage any part if you know how to take care of your skin (such as using makeup removers, cleansers, etc.)
qOKFuXfLaa	well if you will be working for Dior, you need to dress sophisticated (black pants, blouse and even a black blazer). Some department stores require Dior associates wear stocking if they wear skirts. You need to look very presentable and well groomed.       a counter manager basically means you are in charge of inventory, new hires, closing registers, making sure you meet day (in sales), do timekeeping, anything that a regular  manager would do.

qOKFuXfLaa	you can wear false lashes everyday but it's a pain to put them on and take them off. Not to mention how much you will spend having to buy a new set everyother day since lashes are good for about 5-6 uses.

oOzNMiKtaa	Well first you should start by getting some new colors.     I have colors ranging from yellow to black. Once you get some new colors, just experiment with them. Just so you know(in case you didn't), the lightest color goes on top(by eyebrow) the darkest in the crease, and the middle color goes on the lid by the eye lash line. I love to wear green, purple, brown, yellow, ect. I love all colors. They all work for me because I have fair skin. If your skin is dark brown, then some of those colors wouldn't be flattering for you.     Another thing, you should not be putting on brown eye shadow with a black liner. Those do not go well together, and it is too harsh( the black eye liner) for day time wear. If you choose to wear brown shadow, use a brown eye liner.    If you want, check out you tube. There are some GREAT tips on there.|`|ztR13XyJaa	For your eyes, use three different colors. Put the lightest of the colors on the top of your eyelid and medium on the lower part. Then use the darkest color to define the crease of your eyelid. finish off with eyeliner, mascara, and a natural color on your lips.
gPEtpwNvaa	1) I think there are shampoo's specifically for relaxed hair.  But PLEASE do not use Pantene, its really bad for your hair.  If I had to give your brands though, I like Garnier Fructis.  Herbal Essences, Aussie, and Tresemme are good as well. (:    2) I use Garnier Fructis Sleek & Shine.  I love it!  While it moisturizes well, I'd like something with /more/ moisture simply because I don't think you can go wrong with too much moisture.  Can you?  Hmm.    3) Garnier Fructis smell's fruity-ish.  Idk, it smells good. (:  Herbal Essences smells REALLY good.  Hello Hydration is great for making your hair reallyy soft & it smells like coconut.  Aussie [Moist] is good too & smells like coconut as well.    If you don't want something drugstore, go to Sally's [or some hair place] & browse for yourself, or ask one of the people that work there.  They helped me & they know what they're talking about.   Hope I helped & good luck! (:|`|Tzf6YxOjaa	relaxing the hair can be very very very damaging to your hair (which really what do we do that isnt?)

wXloRCegaa	Lipstick is known to have been invented in antiquity when semi-precious jewels were crushed and applied to the lips and occasionally around the eyes. Women in the ancient Indus Valley Civilization applied lipstick to their lips for face decoration.  Ancient Egyptians extracted purplish-red dye from fucus-algin, 0.01% iodine, and some bromine mannite, which resulted in serious illness. Cleopatra had her lipstick made from crushed carmine beetles, which gave a deep red pigment, and ants for a base. Lipsticks with shimmering effects were initially made using a substance found in fish scales called pearlescence.      During the Islamic Golden Age the notable Arab Andalusian cosmetologist Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) invented solid lipsticks, which were perfumed stocks rolled and pressed in special molds, and he described them in his Al-Tasrif.   Lipstick started to gain popularity in England the 16th century, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, who made piercing red lips and bright white faces a fashion statement. By that time, lipstick was made from a blend of beeswax and red stains from plants.    During the Second World War, lipstick gained popularity as a result of its use in the movie industry, and it became commonplace for women to apply makeup, or "put their face on".|`|kW371HVMaa	i dunno to give your lip color or something??!!|`|bHMPolh1aa	too make yer lips look pouty and sexy and shiny and fake.

A similar technique is used in some varieties of orchids, which have petal formations and color patterns that resemble insects.

wXloRCegaa	Honey you and most of the women in America have the same complaint!  You can have your cake and eat it too.  If you like the MAC foundation initially then all you need is a primer. EASY!     A primer is what creates a barrier between your face and your makeup. A moisturizer will not do this for you! A silica based primer is going to sit on your skin and fill in any fine lines or big pores or dry patches, even out skin tone, help your makeup stay on all day and absorb oil. They allow foundation to "stay put" in hot weather. It helps prevent skin from absorbing talc and pigment from your foundation as well as preventing talc from drawing oil from the skin. Most contain botanicals such as lavender, orange, jasmine, rose, geranium, grape, kiwi and aloe extracts to soothe and refresh the skin.

You're 16, and you might realize later in life, when you're a bit more mature, that maybe you shouldn't have put it in such an obvious, visible location.     You can put it in a place where it's very visible with certain types of clothing, and completely hidden with others.    You say you want a toonie-sized tattoo. What's your definition of toonie? Small? Cutesy? Cartoon oriented?    I got a tattoo about 10 years ago, 2 actually, one of Bugs Bunny and one of Henery Hawk. I put them on my back, right around my shoulder blades. With a tank top, they are invisible. Now, with a girl, you could wear a tank top and cover them, or wear a string tank, and show them off. Or something similar.     Please realize that just a few years from now, you'll want a job, and if that tattoo is very noticeable, you might turn off the person considering you for a job.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	I would put it on either my ankle or my shoulder blade.

hAFxcxP0aa	Braids are great for school. They keep out of your face unlike ponytails which can swish around if you have long hair. Although it is quite hard to learn to do braids, once you know, you know for life.    Braids also look great when done properly, here is a few tips to do it properly.    - Wash your hair with the products you use the most.    - Never use a blow drier. I noticed one person said to blow dry your hair, but do not. When you blow dry your hair it blasts out all of the moisture. If your hair dries naturally on its own it will feel and look better but for a braid, do not let your hair dry at all, get straight into it.    - Get your sister or your Mum to do your hair in a braid or do it on your own while its wet as it is much easier to do when wet. Here is how to do your hair in a braid, this website shows you how to do a braid easily: http://www.wikihow.com/Braid-Hair         Apart from braids there are many styles here are a few:    -  Piggy tails (two separate ponytails)  -  Plaits (so easy to do, just cross your hair over in three different    sections)  -  Elegant side ponytails look great. Curl your hair, it looks stunning!  - Classy Up do, up dos are always classy, even if it is a little messy.    This site shows you picture of the last three do's.    http://www.latest-hairstyles.com    This is for long hairstyles:    http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/long/    This is for short hairstyles:    http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/short/     Hope i helped and good luck, im sure you will look great!    x Em|`|Ue9xrUkbaa	(Just wondering how you can have a non-school appropriate school hairdo)     You can try straightening it, and wearing it down, or in 2 pig tail braids.|`|bHMPolh1aa	well, I can't say much, since my hair's choppy and teased and hairsprayed a lot. But you can go with cute braids, leave it down with a nice bow in your bangs, or go cheerleader pig-tails. those always work. even on me, and I'm punk.|`|ADkusTVXaa	Try this:    1. Wash hair and condition it, then brush it out and dry. (If you have naturally curly hair, you may just want to let your hair air dry so that it drys curly)    2. Spray hair with a heat protectant.    3. Curl hair at the ends and the hair by your face. It doesn't need to be perfectly curly all over since you will be braiding it, it just needs to have some wave or curl.     4. Spray your hair lightly with hair spray.  **If your hair is naturally curly, you might be able to skip steps 2, 3, and 4 unless you want to define your curls.    5. Loosely braid your hair on your left side and secure it with a pony tail about half way down the braid, so that you still have a lot of curly hair at the bottom.    6. Optional: Touch up the curls at the bottom of the braid. Enjoy!    or...    1. Go ahead and wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner if you haven't already. Tip: While you're rinsing out your conditioner, it makes hair easier to manage if you use a wide-tooth comb and comb out your hair.    2. Before you blow dry your hair, run an anti-frizz serum or heat- protecting serum through your hair to make it more manageable. Blow dry your hair with the dryer and a round brush to make a slight curve under at the bottom of your hair. Blow dry until your hair is perfectly dry.    3. Brush through your hair while waiting for the curling iron to heat up. The size of the curling iron depends on how long your hair is; so, short hair use a one inch, long hair, use a wide barrel curling iron.    4. Curl the ends of your hair by making sure the clamp part of the curling iron is on top, and roll the iron halfway up your hair.    5. Brush back the front section or bangs of your hair. Hold it back and pin it down with bobby pins/clip. (Leave just a little bump) Spray with hairspray.|`|DGGNXoXraa	any hairstyle is appropriate for school. but here are some pics of hairstyles and how to do them:    curled and bangs up with a little bit of pouf in it:  http://dresslikemiley.net/hair/hairguide...    straight and parted to the side(this one will look good on you!)  http://dresslikemiley.net/hair/hairguide...    curled and very cute:  http://dresslikemiley.net/hair/hairguide...    in a low ponytail with bangs out:  http://dresslikemiley.net/hair/hairguide...    in low braids with some bangs out:  http://dresslikemiley.net/hair/hairguide...    in a messy bun:  http://dresslikemiley.net/hair/hairguide...    i hope i helped!!btw, i used miley in all of the pictures because she has long hair and u said u had long hair...so yea.    p.s. if u dont already have side bangs, get them! they r sooo cute and u can do lots of different hairstyles with it.     p.s.s if u want to see more hairstyles, just go to dresslikemiley.net and click on "hair" in the left corner.    bye and i hope i helped!!|`|ktmWrcvwaa	Here's a few ways, I'll try to include pictures for most.  1.

Ffgzipq5aa	I wish I had let the tattoo artist draw up a more intricate design for my first tattoo.  Still, it was my 18th birthday and I couldn't wait even a day more so I can't say it's really a regret.  I still love the tat but I think it could have been more defined.|`|N2FBBCAGaa	On one i have total regret. Going for laser removal Feb. 17.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	One on the back of my arm could have done with being about an inch higher with hindsight, the top of it is in line with my armpit crease but I would have actually preferred it to come up onto the shoulder because it looks too low down and 'floaty' in relation to the work on my back (hard to describe without pics!)... but it's all good because I've designed a pretty simple roman numerals tattoo (four lines of family birth dates in r. nums.) to go about an inch higher than it, I've tested out a transfer of the same design and stuck it on and it actually looks better than it would have done with the one I already have a little higher, so all's well that end's well! I do sometimes look at some of my back ones and wish I'd had them slightly bigger, but they're pretty big anyway, I am just a sucker for big tattoos, there's no pleasing me! But the more space left = the more space to work with! :-)|`|bAYVSfdJaa	I wish I would have spent more time on color, or maybe just have gotten the outline first & gotten it colored in later.  The eye of it (it's a lizard by the way) is pretty neat, so is the shading, but I wish the body was colored differently, or maybe even done in black ink.
HRL4t9yraa	When I was 20 I got a tattoo of a lily on my back on the lower right side. There is a little more "cushion" there than in the middle of the back, so it didn't hurt too bad! You could take Tylenol about an hour before you get it (stay away from aspirin though as it thins the blood). Don't worry- a tattoo hurts less than donating blood (in my experience anyway!)|`|7RGtUnQJaa	I can't answer your question but I think the only place that looks good is the lower back.. but, I heard you cant get a needle when you are having a baby if you get a tattoo there.|`|Rivzjjckaa	I got one one the base of my neck and it didnt hurt at all even though it was over the spine, I could hardly feel it.   I also got one on my lowerback which hurt a bit when he did the outline over my kidneys but it was bearable.|`|Ffgzipq5aa	Everybody's pain tolerance is different and what hurts on me may feel like nothing to you.  Personally I have one on my lower back and one on my right shoulder blade.  The shoulder one hurt more but it's also a larger tattoo.  General rule of thumb would be anywhere that is right over a bone is going to hurt worse than somewhere with more "padding".|`|Wz5cj7siaa	I have a few tattoos and the upper middle of your back between the shoulder blades hurts the least but it also depends on the scale and detail of the tattoo.
3da8818f1b538bab7d343b90171547c2aa	Natural oils from skin.  Don't wear eyeliner for several days.  It will get better and you can try again.|`|MkyiYw1faa	why not just go without makeup on those kind of days? Seriously, Im sure you dont look THAT bad without it!|`|sBgCUQWzaa	use some kinda base b4 u put eyeshadow or eyeliner on. it gives tha stuff somethin to stick to.    try:    *urban decay primer potion (best)    *any liquid foundation    *neutral shade eyeshadow    all of these work just fine. after youve primed ur lids, THEN put on wat u want. it'll have good staying power and last all dayy
t8G0ls9uaa	You are all really equal at this point, and on the plain side of pretty, mostly because you are just too young to be considered truly pretty in the looks arena.  You are all also pretty young to be worried about it, because what may look best now might not as an adult.    Any of you could stand out if you realized that most people don't look that great with long, straight hair with no bangs.  Yes, it's kind of a popular look, but most people look better with bangs and some body to their hair.    I think the brunette will be naturally the prettiest as an adult, provided she keeps her weight under control (not that she's big now, because she's not!!, but she's a bit shorter and such).  But, you will all end up being pretty as you get older.|`|VkXv4RInaa	get back to me in about 5 years and we'll talk|`|rd6eRnzTaa	you're all like 5.|`|90ZaNZE4aa	idk   the picture is too hard to look at|`|yUP05L2Iaa	the short one|`|gYyW39wTaa	The one on th right|`|gOI2Bgfjaa	1|`|ALidyPnXaa	None of you are pretty, so you can't   really chose the prettiest. =)  But the middle one is the  best in the bunch...|`|BiJwd0n8aa	far right!|`|yM3QtXgPaa	the one on the left with the long sleeve shirt.|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	Wow.  They are standing on the wall.    Cool.|`|MbFS6XFQaa	They're all plain janes :\|`|oZtbDrMcaa	I think you all are pretty. The one on the left has a pretty smile, the middle has pretty eyes, and the right's face is soft and light. I like this pic!|`|I9SPul34aa	the middle girl.|`|aOx2hovgaa	i like the far right..very pretty.|`|DDDhLFb2aa	left|`|cQ9T3YNmaa	dam my neck hurts now thx.  they are all pretty ;]|`|pHEIxQoBaa	WOAH!!!!   are you guys like clones er sumtin?|`|oSDppSwVaa	uhh they are all sort of pretty.  i think the one in the middle is prettiest :)|`|iEI0lgmBaa	the last one|`|GZRTLEuiaa	hard to tell there all pretty.  i think maybe the middle?  i think the girl w/ the brown hair would be the prettyest if she got side bangs cause right now her hair has like nothing to it.       ~Francesca-|`|nyQMDwWYaa	They are all VERY purrty!  But if you want the PRETTIEST,  I would pick....  the farthest left.    [:|`|5EnengZaaa	oh wow they are all gorgeous...i would say the one on the right though|`|e44113cd9f21585ce32b6f910959288daa	All of them are equally cute.  My problem with this question why would you ask this and set yourself up to be hurt if you are in that particular photo.  Some might and most likely pic you as the ugly one.  Not that you are ugly but everyone don't find the same things attractive.  Then feelings will be hurt over someone else's truth.  Love yourself and stop fishing for compliments and/or degradation.  Neither is attractive in my book.|`|Y6FhzwoAaa	all pretty!!!!  but maybe middle?  idk all pretty tho!|`|KVzDQ19Iaa	Seriously who cares. You're all like... 14 anyway. You'll look back on this picture like as little as 3 years from now and be mad at your appearances anyway.|`|L2g0lm5Yaa	All.|`|B3LZqvPfaa	the one in the back with the boots|`|1UDLn1Boaa	I think they're all very pretty as well.|`|6EAgKSRBaa	the girl in the middle.. her shirt is so cute too :]|`|YI9Js4qraa	I think the one on the right, she's gorgeous!|`|3iHYYELoaa	MIDDLE!!|`|d0BRip3gaa	It was really hard to pick because all of them were really good but, i liked the one on the right the most.
lhOd2hvXaa	Burt's Bees is WELL worth the extra cost!    You'll never go back to chapstick again after using their lip balm.    Good Luck!|`|fALkYOC1aa	I love love love Burt's Bees products.  They are wonderful-- but they are pricey.  I don't know that it was worth it or not.  You will have to be the one to decide that.    Are the products great? --yes.  Are they worth paying double from other brands? -- I would say no...|`|tAe1D6MIaa	burts bees rocks for dry lips, only kind of capstick i use =)|`|3ivRqDQ9aa	there products are awesome!!!|`|BLQsD0w5aa	No offense, but I think carmex works a thousand times better than burt's bee's.|`|uSqc6bUuaa	i love burts bees you made a great purchase|`|ZpltzTIfaa	Yes...I LOVE LOVE LOVE all of their stuff...Great Purchase!|`|3e73d8c98dfc80052c68be6c3ba37270aa	I like a lot of Burt's Bees products.    Some of my favorites:    Peppermint foot lotion  Regular lip balm (peppermint)  Honey lip balm  Lip Shimmers in Watermelon color (Peppermint flavor)  Hand Salve  Bath Oil|`|8yokh359aa	I love those products!  The BB sticks make your lips feel so soft, and they have mint oil or something in them and it makes your whole face feel fresh.   There was a time when I would buy one right after the other, never running out.  I got over it, but its worth the $3 to try.|`|85KL0eUUaa	I have burt's bees lip balm.  I got it off ebay, a 7 pack for $12AUD including postage (although now with the economy I'd probably have to pay more like $20)    It is the second best thing I have ever used.  The first was a weird peppermint balm from a Chinese deli, but the owners moved back to China, and I have not seen it anywhere in a shop and can't find it on the net.    I own more than 150 lip glosses and balms at last count.  and lol they don't sell it at target here in aus, they only have it in david jones (which is our most upmarket expensive department store chain)|`|O9VW6RjEaa	It's a wonderful brand.   I've used their Deep Pore Scrub, and loved it.   (Really disgusting) but I had warts on my face (I don't even know how!)  But then when I started using it, it magically went away, after years of having them there.   And my auntie used their Shampoo and can't get over it. =)  It made her hair so shiny and volumized.   And I love the smell of their products.
4DgEnlKZaa	I have been using the Neutrogena Skin ID System for 2 weeks.  My acne has reduced, but my skin is extremely dry from the treatment. If you have sensitive skin, I suggest you do not buy this.  I have the Cream Cleanser (14), the anti-acne treatment (32), and the hydrator (72).  The Cream Cleanser and the hydrator are both contain salicylic acid, which drys out your skin.  A free spot treatment also comes with it, which contains salicylic acid. 3 out of the 4 products I was sent contain salicylic acid, so it's like I am just using the same thing 3 times.  I am going to cancel my account, because I don't think it is worth the money.  I have used proactiv, and I think Skin ID dries out skin more than proactiv does.  I suggest you go to your dermatologist and get acne cream, like Differin, or see what your dermatologist thinks you should do. Skin ID works, but it makes my skin so dry I only use it once a day, and some days I don't use it because my skin is so dry.  You should not waste money on Skin ID.|`|yzIB8Cbiaa	If you want to use that, take the test and see what it recommends for you, then go to walmart and buy them separately. It's sooo much cheaper and the exact same thing.  However, it neutrogena doesn't work for me!|`|DUOoMBqoaa	I think they both contain drying ingredients. Proactiv was the worst though. Nutrogena has Salacylic Acid and BP in it. I used the Acne Wash system for years and it seemed to work OK. I didn't want to stop using it because I was afraid my skin would break out. Surprisingly, when I finally did switch from the chemical treatments to natural brands like Alba, Juice Beauty, and others that use fruit enzymes and tea tree oil, my skin was WAY better. I would never go back. My face is so soft now, that even when I get a little acne it heals way faster and doesn't stay red.   Oh, one other thing. The Nutrogena sells the pills too, which just contain probiotics which you can get at natural food stores for much cheaper. They actually work pretty well too.  Good luck.|`|x9nEFd0maa	dont waste your money on that ****.  it doesn't work.|`|ZA6A2adbaa	my friend has it and she says it doesnt|`|90I1UlS4aa	It Depends on your skin really my cousin has it and she said it worked but then again my friend has the same exact thing and she says it doesnt. ive tried my friends once when i was on vaction with her. it kinda worked for me. it defiantly works better then proactiv, to me anyway. if u dont wana spend $40 dollars which is alot go to walmart and get it in the skin department its way cheaper and its the same thing. if u decide to buy it and use it, i hope it works for you hun!    All the infomation i typed here is totally truthful!      Much Love  -mindy
bHLCjPIHaa	my best advice. pop it. i no it sounds gross but it wont leave a scar if you put  on moisturizing lotion right afterwords. and if you dont want anyone to notice on monday and you still dont pop it just put some intense coverup on it|`|dBuc8c2Raa	Been there before!    Put some toothpaste on it (not gel, the paste works better) to dry it out.  I would recommend putting it on tonight before bed (use an old pillowcase!).    To lessen the redness and inflammation, try Preparation-H hemorrhoid cream.    If all else fails, pick up some Clearsil Rapid Action Treatment Cream.    Good luck :)|`|SnNpORdoaa	try applying toothpaste overnight...|`|bh880Zljaa	Run a washcloth under some hot water, not to hot that you scald yourself and apply it, you need to keep it heated. Do this for about ten minutes then switch to putting the cloth in cold water and doing the same with it. You will need to do this a few times a day. Heat is known to reduce swelling and cold will reduce swelling. Now the kind of pimples that do not pop are the hardest to get rid of, the only thing you can really is time, you can reduce the look and size of the pimple and keep putting acne meds on it. If its still there you can always use a good concealer. good luck hon!!!!|`|r2QIbmPIaa	ah its a cyst pimple. hate those! well anyone do not pop it! trust me, been there done that. it will leave a scare which is worse then having the zit. hold an ice cube on it for a while and that will reduce the swelling. All you can do with these suckers are just use cover up on them. good luck with that :[|`|axj0rtntaa	put toothpaste on it over night. it might burn when u put it on. then wash it off in the morning. when using ur proactive product put some toothpaste on the zit for a min then wash it off and use the proactive like you normally would. (do not use toothpaste as a mask, you will cry it buurrrnnnnsss :P) if your skin becomes very dry use cream or body lotion[body lotion best]|`|HF3iyIGVaa	Start with buying some rope, and make a nuse.|`|yenUJGsoaa	you can pop it and then wash your face,use face wash like clear ace|`|fkqPs9QRaa	its only one zit, calm down, no ones gonna give u crap about it.  Just whatever you do, DO NOT pop it....  It'l just leave a scar.  My whole face is covered and i gotta go to school everyday with it.|`|CuhJRewLaa	when you try to pop it when its not ready, thats what makes it red is all the blood goin into it, it also makes it bigger    just try not to pop it until you see white on the surface|`|tWePoJYNaa	I have a similar problem. I've been using benzol peroxide for my face and that clears things up.     As for the first answer to your question, if that guy thinks he's funny he should learn how to spell.|`|6qPndPvXaa	put toothpaste on it...it works      lol plbsh is soooo funny  I forgot to laugh since he can't even spell noose...|`|zJNlm5Jyaa	do not use the refining mask and see what happens. if it doesn't work then girlfriend you've got trouble:)|`|DNZFw76taa	alchohol will dry it out, so then u can pop it. Don't worry. By monday it should be gone. Wash your face thoroughly throughout the night and wash your hands before touching your face.
TDFTZcjYaa	try Veet.  it's a bladeless razor and should remove the hair without cutting into the skin.|`|4lqwMnhJaa	No, Nair is very bad for sensitive skin. I thought it would be all right to try even though my skin is very sensitive and it burned! It was very painful :(|`|lxYWZc9caa	I used it, and after a while it got really irritated from the Nair. I would go with waxing|`|LnzUMUCdaa	no u should just stick to the razr but shave while its dry i do that n get barely any cuts or anything
uMNoVPxoaa	If you're not getting enough protein, that makes your hair fall out.  check your diet.  Doesn't sound like anything your doing would cause it to fall out.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Rinse your hair with apple cider vinegar (add around 2 tbsp in a mug of water and use it as a last rinse) this prevents hair  loss. Check out http://usefulinfo-hairloss.blogspot.com/  for more info.|`|lk4ulp69aa	well possibly because if you don't shower for a day the teenage body becomes stinky and gross, meaning that you should take a shower every day! And it's feeling greasy because you probably aren't using the right shampoo & conditioner, or you aren't washing your hair frequently enough, and also, if you use alot of hair products and you don't wash your hair, it will eventually fall out. I recommend that you wahs your hair every Monday and Wednsday just to be safe, use only a handfull of shampoo and condtioner, and take a shower every day.|`|J3HKl0Hqaa	It could be your shampoo/conditioner/hair spray or any product that you put in or near your hair. or you could be allergic to one or the other.|`|8u3e6jnJaa	are you feeling stressed at the moment ? hair loss can be down to stress . or check with your doctor , you may have alapecia - which can be treated ..  the itchiness may have something to do with the shampoo , try a more gentle shampoo - and make sure you wash  it out properly ..|`|Hkk58RGfaa	maybe its a drug (medication) your taking? once my doctor gave me a pill and it made my hair fall out but when i was done it grew back. Or maybe your combing it to hard. Just braid it before bed. Or get a hair cut it woudl grow back thicker.  ps= take biotin it makes your hair grow nuts n nails lol  or go to a pro salon for a scalp treatment|`|nAfiytfcaa	You might be allergic to the shampoo and conditioner. That could cause hair loss. Did you change your shampoo? Talk to a good stylist. They should know what shampoos work best for itchy scalp. My stylist suggested Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo. It worked for me. Good luck!

[;|`|f4DHP9ysaa	erm i used to until i found out he had a girlfriend soooooooooo NO|`|54c33c2b2da66481bc77a67c47e5c81daa	if u want the girl to get the picture of flirting, then maybe he can smirk so show some interest if not going up to the girl in person|`|mji7KtSEaa	Actually that makes me kind of nervous--like he doesn't like me or anything. But it also makes me curious--to really find out what he thinks of me. Not too many guys a know show their shy side.|`|4Euhp1Rvaa	yes, it's flattering|`|iEI0lgmBaa	smirks cus hes shy|`|c5945tSvaa	no0o i would feel like they are laughing at me...  :o|`|6AISCFZCaa	i do actually, it gives me this feeling that felt.....kinda good|`|6YDmNdasaa	It depends .....  Its cute sometimes but then when he looks away and i want to like smile at him or something then i never get the chance to!  But when you know their looking at you because they think your cute or something, and then they do the shy thing ... then id say that's pretty cute =)|`|YI9Js4qraa	I love it! It gives me this really fluttery and melting feeling inside :D|`|3iHYYELoaa	depends how cute the guy is. but if a guy is too shy its not attractive|`|3tDqt9sXaa	yessssss  its cute  :)|`|1rO9Fs7faa	its cutee.   as long as it doesn't come of the wrong way.  i mean she can think that your looking at her because she's ugly or somethingg.|`|Mt3B2K6haa	that's so cute!    lol|`|ICRt7C6Caa	aww thats totally cutee :)|`|2G8lOPN8aa	Only if it his natural response... not if it is some affectated response designed as part of his come on routine.  Nothing is more unattractive than a fake.|`|lb4ADeRzaa	maybe not smirk, but if he looks away then looks at you again  and smiles. Why dont you talk to her on msn or something?|`|HiuZs5G5aa	hahahaha, shy guys are not what most girls are into. some are but most girls are turned off by that.  if you want girls, KEEP EYE CONTACT> its really attractive and shows you have confidence which also is really attractive|`|rOPp8qMxaa	depends on the guy,haha :)|`|HypqcnJaaa	Yeahh, cute lol. You know what's scary though? When he doesn't look away and just keeps staring!!!! Eye contact my a**! CREEPY! So yeah, never do that to a girl. I hope you know that already. :)|`|qWIha03Iaa	I love it!.   Shy guys are cute, but I like a little confidence also.   It'll get their attention, that's for sure.|`|TuBzc1R5aa	cuteeeee! love it|`|n8nGuu70aa	ah-dorable :)|`|6tRN09Sdaa	aww yes some  do. i think its cute, and my favorite part is when we lock eyes. :)|`|Kq2rFuIyaa	yes. but not smirking but like shy smile|`|YPZXcxwBaa	Turn away...semi cute. Doesn't exactly turn you on. Smirks? No. Makes girl think you are arrogant. Shy smile? YES! It makes girls feel protective and want to hug you.    If I were trying to reach girls, though, I would wink. Girls that are available would like it, and girls that weren't wouldn't matter. Don't stare at someone or try to make them look at you, though. That's just creepy.    :-) Hope this helps! :-)|`|ALidyPnXaa	it's super cute ! xD|`|0AQF8pnKaa	yes :)  but for a response, do it a couple of times to show your interested in them.|`|FQuuztpQaa	Smirks?

Seems creep-like.|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	sure i do ; )|`|Sc6oGITNaa	yeah its cute.  it gives me butterflies.    haha.|`|ExL22JZWaa	yes, but it depends what kind of smirk. like if its a smirk smirk she may think hes a jerk, but if its a cute little smile than yeah its cute|`|brHPYhWbaa	YES!!!|`|aD0SdVKdaa	i like it but i would want them to do the same thing over again to let me know he is intersted that maybe come and talk to me.|`|LzWGkzSCaa	yea cus it looks cute like they are innocent and like they look at you but are to shy to look at you in the eyes but yea thats cute.|`|BZcVLM8faa	its adorable|`|eX8i4vwRaa	yeah :)  i think its super cute when a guys shy.    i hate guys who think they can take the lead and just have control over me and be cocky. ugh so annoying.    but what you just said sounds super cute! ?  xo me :)|`|gZ5m3o96aa	thats pretty cute when a guy does that.|`|mBhW5zZ9aa	...until you want him to make the first move and he's too shy, so you never end up talking|`|nhIM65uwaa	Mmm yes, it is,.

PD91hIYWaa	Try it - just because its targeted at older women doesnt means its only for them. Also - try Dove moisturizer. Its great!|`|2j84hXguaa	It will make you 13 again.|`|bCjmjnqgaa	Yes you can try it.<br>  Honestly its never to early to start anti aging. No i am not reccommending that every 13 year old reading this go buy a firming moisturizer, but at every age there are steps you can take and should. <br>  <br>  Although I'm notsure it will help with your uneven skin tone. Try using a moisturizer that helps with uneven complexion- Both Ambi and Aveeno make some. I think Aveeno even has a night cream  & serum for the problem. Palmers makes a cream that fades uneven spots due to sundamage, birth control pills and acne Its called Eventone Success Fade Cream I believe.

LZWZXPOeaa	It was quite nice.  Good sense of pitch.  I'm not quite sure why she chose to overlap her voice to sound like two people singing unison - difficult at best.  But lovely song.  Very good understanding of phrasing for a 9 year old.  I liked the rather innocent picture of kissing - age appropriate.      Keep practicing.  Voices change greatly in the near years to come.

Naturally there are a number of things she can do to improve as she grows but the "incurable" things are not there (like a "tin ear").    Tell her to work on enunciation, on holding a note and "loosening" her throat.  Again, these are more adult things which will come with training as she ages.    I would encourage her to take some lessons and develop her voice as she hits puberty.
Gi1kN8ukaa	Face masks make your pores smaller. What i would suggest doing is putting a steaming hot, wet rag over your face for one minute (3 times). This will open up your pores. Now that your pores are open, you will want to clean them out. This is easier to do when your pores are open. So wash your face. Then put on a mask to seal your pores up and close them. This will make it harder for dirt to come into your pores.|`|J7o7FtZdaa	They help a little bit.|`|aDElEo4Xaa	yes.|`|JXsLiAJqaa	yeah if u get the right one. try queen helene the original mint julep masque. it helps acne and works great

I wear concealer, mascara. sometimes eyeliner, if i have enough time. my mom isn't entirely happy that my sister and I wear makeup, but she doesn't particularly care. I think she figures that it's what's on the outside that counts, and what we look like on the outside affects nothing other than occasionally our confidence.           my mom focuses much more on who we are as people, and how we treat others, than how we wear our makeup. honestly, in the scheme of things, how big is this really? compared to world peace and poverty and genocide? tons of people would kill to have problems as minor as you and your mom's. just have her keep that in mind while you're talking to her about it.|`|A3fYo8eYaa	Your nearly 14. I started wearing make-up at 13. Just ask her is it okay if you start wearing make up as long as you cleanse tone and mosturise. If it's only clear mascara and concealer it'll be fine. It's not like your plastering it on yourself.    Good Luck!|`|0VYyNMQWaa	just say your growing up and you want to wear make up and your more mature now.|`|asIhe7BNaa	Well, sit your mother down when you can talk alone and she won't be distracted, and tell her that you want to begin to learn how to wear make up. A great thing to do is to call a department store, say Nordstroms or Macy's or Sak's, and set up an appointment with one of their make up counters (I suggest Clinique or Dior, because MAC is too wild for a younger person), and have the make up artist show you and your mom a natural palette for your skin tone. That way your mom sees that you aren't trying to grow up too fast. Good luck!

fRBk2G2paa	Ok nice question and lets start from when u get up early morning<br>  <br>  once u get up do yoga for 10 min. Simply inhale and exhale (long breath). Extra oxygen in blood oxidises ur impurities in blood keeping ur skin healthy<br>  <br>  When u wash ur face simply wash it with a face wash clean and clear or himalaya face wash is what i recommend. Select them as per ur face type (normal dry oily)<br>  <br>  Use a good mild soap when u bath. Dove is good. Others common soaps generally make ur skin dry and dont provide nourishment. After using soap take a shower and use a shower gel (pamolive is good) again take a shower. Atleast twice a weak use scrub soap.<br>  <br>  U may go to office or college. Use a sunscreen. We just can avoid the polluting environment. But we can take precautions. Cover urself well when u r travvelling.(like wearing hand gloves, dupatta etc..)<br>  <br>  carry a face wash along and wash ur face only once during tea break/ lunch break.<br>  <br>  Once u r back home <br>  Take multani mitti (makes skin smooth) + 2-3 drops of glycerene/ fresh cream of milk (removes wrinkles and nourishes) add some water/rose water and make a paste. apply it all over ur face/body and let it dry. Once dry wash it off. <br>  <br>  Twice a weak add dried neem leaves powder and methi powder to the above paste. It will keep pimples away.<br>  <br>  Use anne french once a week <br>  <br>  Avoid bleaching it actually spoils ur skin. Once or twice before some important party is ok.<br>   <br>  Diet - Eat healthy. Take lots of fruit. Citrus acid in fruit keeps ur skin young and as rightly brought out by many others drink lots and lots of water.<br>  <br>  And most important...<br>  Always remain happy and keep smiling it naturally adds freshness to ur skin cauz it keeps ur face muscles active and feel good hormones do their wonder.|`|sro58m5zaa	drink lot of water, eat lot of veg and fruits, 5 each day<br>  hv good sleep<br>  u can do fruit mask as well <br>  <br>  cheers !|`|FFN1oismaa	Home Remedies for Glowing Skin & Smooth Skin<br>  <br>  You can transform your dry skin into a super smooth, soft, supple, and glowing skin by using these home remedies.<br>  <br>     1.<br>  <br>        Mash a banana with milk and apply on face and leave it for 20 minutes.

QvN5FhFnaa	i dont own it personally but a guru on youtube called xteener uses it in a few of her videos, so i would check them out :)
zlXofrG4aa	Red is an extremely hard colour to keep.  There are a few ways.  Next time when you dye your hair red put in a protein filler for grays.  It can be found at Sally's.  Blonde hair has been stripped of it's proteins and it needs it back to be able to keep colour better.  After redyeing you need to stop washing your hair as much, omg eww I know but it's not bad for you it's actually good.  If you wash your hair once every 2-3 days it's better than everyday.  "But omg my hair gets too greasy after 1 day!" That's because your hair isn't conditioned to not be so greasy so fast.  It's like going on a diet, your body doesn't want the smaller portions at first because your stomach is still stretched out, after a few weeks it's better because your stomach has shrank so you feel fuller with those smaller portioned meals.  When you wash your hair everyday you're stripping it of it's natural oils and because you're doing it so often your head is creating more and more faster and faster to keep up with you.  After not washing so often your head realizes it doesn't need to make as much oil anymore since you're not getting rid of it everyday.  For the time being to get rid of the greasyness and not wash your hair, rub baby powder into it.  The powder absorbs the oil.  <br>  Also when you do wash your hair you need to wash it with the coldest water you can possibly stand.  Wash your body with whatever temperature you like but when it gets to your hair you need to wash it in cold water.  Hot water opens up the hair and lets the dye out, that's why it fades fastly, but cold water closes up the hair and keep the colour in.<br>  All of this combined will keep your red colour longer.  If you want to keep it you'll do all of this.  If you don't, you'll be doomed to have mucky orangey hair after dyeing it red a few days in for the rest of your life.  Or until you want a different colour like brown.|`|fjTVAbdBaa	red is a really hard color to keep from fading. I can't remember exactly why... maybe the color molecules are larger? I don't remember. Make sure you are using a high quality dye, not out of a box! And also that is it permanent... no brainer. Otherwise, dye it again! Eventually the color will stick. There are also shampoos esp for red hair to help prevent fading. Good Luck.|`|s63bm0Guaa	you will need to color your hair again. then get yourself a PROFESSIONAL color care shampoo and conditioner. <br>  Wella Color protect is really really good. its the only one on the market proven to keep your color 70% longer.

There's a bigger chance that you'll just break off your natural lashes. If anything, I'd say go for a non-waterproof mascara, when you're ready to touch them up a bit, run a little water over a finger, then wipe the lashes upward (don't rub them against your eyes, it'll make a mess). Then after the mascara's a bit broken down, apply a fresh coat. Ta-da! No big clumpy mess! Hope that helped out. Good luck!|`|7mmmGytpaa	try a waterproof mascara so it doesn't run :)|`|YbO7D6axaa	I know you said that if you put another coat on it'll make it clumpy, but if you use a clear mascara for a touch up after you've already put black or brown mascara on, it gives more lift and makes you're lashes look shiny which helps the eyes to look more open, wide and bright. Trust me, I do this myself. :)|`|M48tdQf0aa	once mascara is dried, dont put more on then it looks like a caked on mess.    when your done if you touch up your eyeliner, and maybe put one swipe of mascara on just to make it look more bright youll be fine.    if you have enough time to take it off and redo your  whole makeup routine then do so to look completely flawless.|`|yHWkQs9Paa	What I do is heat my eyelash curler with a blow-dryer for a couple seconds, and curl my eyelashes.

Do your poker-straight lashes need a curl? Or do you just want to pump up the volume?     The look of natural: For a simple day look, go for a formula free of volumizers or fibres. For an ultra-natural look, use clear, colourless mascara. All mascaras can be used for a natural look - it just depends on how much you apply. Just one or two coats will do for a natural look.    on-waterproof mascaras have lighter formulas and don't weigh lashes down as much.
Ffgzipq5aa	The best way to find a good tattoo artist is to look up ones in you area and then go visit them yourself.  That way you get to check out the shop and the artist for yourself.  Remember, having a clean shop, while important, is not everything.  You're going to want to look at the artist's portfolio and spend some time talking with them about what you want done before you make any final decisions.
ddXQeEvNaa	Use a little eyebrow grooming tool (you know the one with the brush on one side and the tiny comb on the other) and the brush to brush them upwards, they should look kind of crazy at, and then trim right along the top edge of your eyebrow. That way you don't cut off more than you should. I wish there was a picture, it's a lot easier to explain that way.|`|AA10755311	Trimming them is alright, which a lot of people are afraid of, but it's not a bad thing to do, and they do it when you get your brows waxed professionally.

This time, its his turn to work|`|PheCncFwaa	well i know everyone says this is stupid but have someone talk to him for you casually and make sure that it doesnt seem like you sent them ........then you can build up on your relationship and talk to him yourself....... like a lot of people i dont like face to face confrentation in dificult situations like yours so thats wat i would do, also try smiling at him when ur around him and make him feel like ur not mad and maybe he'll start talking to you , finally maybe a txt would work just to kinda break the barrier between you two        *im going thru the same thing and i know how much it sucks i know i gave you a lot of ways but i hope one works out for you.. good luck ?|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	Fart.  That's what I do when it gets too quite.|`|YI9Js4qraa	Maybe he's afraid that you're starting to think of him as something more than a friend? Boys can be like that.    You don't want to lose him if he's graduating this year, try to be nice to him in little ways. Say "hi," in the hallways or lend him a pencil!

bAYVSfdJaa	There's no way to heal it better or faster.  And it getting "stuck" is fine, mine did it. I don't think moving it is a good idea, but if that's what you were told, listen to them. As far as the pain, take ibuprofen. Soreness is also normal - it'll be like that for awhile.  You should stop messing with it & just leave it be, aside from when you're cleaning it.     And 8 weeks is too soon to mess with it, by the way.  Bellybutton piercings can take up to a year to fully heal.|`|Nj58Vi62aa	Just go back where you got it pierced and get them to tell yuo ! :) Always ask professionals lol . i learned that the hard way|`|BLQsD0w5aa	You've only had it pierced for a few days. Just keep doing what you're doing, and it'll heal perfectly. I got mine done about 4 years ago and used the exact same products as you. The pain went away fast, and it healed beautifully.|`|HyDBQZhdaa	Yes! definitely. instead of the h2oxygen, use HYDROGEN PEROXIDE SOLUTION!!!!!!!!!!! I used it 2 clean my ears and it worked really well. apply it with a q-tip on the back & front of your ear, then turn it 2 times each way if you can so that it can get in your piercing to heal. The Turning makes a HUGE difference! Trust me. I hope my advice works! it really worked 4 me!

84Dauu2xaa	If you find them too harsh looking, you can get them bleached.  Professionally, don't do it yourself because it's dangerous.  They can control the shade by how long the bleach is left on.  But after that you'll have to maintain it, so it's a little troublesome.  Or you could make the eyebrow shape thinner instead, so it's less heavy and dramatic.  Don't go too far off what's natural, I'm sure lots of people would love to dark brows like yours : )|`|jcGnBgAPaa	i would go have my eye brows done professionally. they can thin them out and dye them if necessary. also, have your hair done. add some highlights, natural one though so you don't get that skunk hair look|`|gzMZRbmIaa	my eyebrows match my brown hair|`|mrrVtKGgaa	????|`|KEgN3KLtaa	My eyebrows only look lighter because I have very fine eyebrows, but if you look close, you can tell they're the same shade of brown.|`|bMhLdnsbaa	they should be the same color as your hair. duh!!!|`|BcAocj0Naa	i would make them kinda thin with a medium high arch|`|LGt8HyBOaa	Get them bleached 2 shades lighter than your hair colour.
XUrgcOMDaa	I'm not familiar with Dylon dyes, but I have used Rit dyes before.  Wool is pretty easy... I'm sure you'll be fine dying that cardigan in your washing machine.<br>  <br>  The only thing to watch out for:  is the stitching really visible on the sweater?  If it's cotton stitching, sometimes it won't dye the same as another fabric, like, in this case, wool.<br>  <br>  <br>  But, really, in my opinion, I think you'll be fine.  You're going darker, so it'll be fine.  Just follow the instructions on your dye container.|`|F32uPjAraa	Dylon should work alright, wool is pretty easy to work with, and you can get wool wet. just do not wring it out.

osp2ELq7aa	That sounds like a great idea, but it may be hard for a tattoo artist to incorporate the scar within the writing.    The most popular tattoo's to cover up scars are Lotus Flowers and Orchids, as these flowers are traditional symbols or signs for new growth and a new begginning. The orchid is popular as on a woman it means refinement, a new start.  The lotus flower is popular, as it begins its life in mud and sludge and grows up through this to finally reach the light and flower into something amazing.    Here is the meaning behind the lotus tattoo.  http://ezinearticles.com/?The-Meaning-an...

VN2wyTnFaa	I really like the way the foundation looks, but it doesn't give a ton of coverage. If you have a lot of acne or anything you want to cover up, then you really will have to rely on the concealer. It's definitely worth the money, and it's all the same products, so they should all work the same. Hope that helped! Good luck!

KTj9g2mGaa	I am 15 and 120 pounds beat that! im still healthy and look fine. just keep exercizing and eat heathy- no junk food. Or if you do eat junk food, just work it off. And have fun when working out! Dance to some music in your room!|`|TDFTZcjYaa	Eat healthy. Watch the biggest loser, they give you tips on how to eat right.    don't stop eating, it slows down your metabolism and makes it worse for you in the long run. Pay attention to the portion size of your meals. Eat 3 meals a day. Fiber One is good for breakfast. Have Yoplait Yogurt as a snack, and chewing gum in the afternoon reduces snack cravings.    also, a 15 year old person at 5'5" and 100 lbs is actually underweight. however, if you still want to lose weight, which you obviously do, just do as I said. Also, don't just do random exercises. running is good, but also do crunches (the right way) and push ups. look at seventeen magazine's website for good ways to work out. try to work out at least 3 days a week, and make a schedule for yourself. work on your thighs, calves, and hips one day; abs, butt, sides the next day; etc. etc. organization is the key. if you have a plan, it's difficult to fall off track. just make a plan and follow it step by step.    try dancing, too. it's really good exercise for all parts of your body.  you need to do different types of work-outs because just running isn't going to reduce all parts of your body.|`|AEF5Hj4faa	Lol..  Your not fat.|`|HiuZs5G5aa	omg. you probably need to gain weight not lose it. if you want to be healthy. what is your height, thats actually what matters.|`|55G0BNCzaa	not eating can actualy make you bloated.

I don't care if not eating is unhealthy, I'd rather be skinny and unhealthy than fat and healthy. Staring from tomorow I am going to just stop eating-it works. It's really easy. Just don't eat for a day and after that day it's easy coz you get used to it. It worked on me before but then i went on holiday and there was so much food i couldn't help but eat it and my mum was like forcing me to eat. And yes throwing up really does make you lose weight.

They can lead you down the road of recovery. By the way i'm thirteen, and 120 pounds and i feel beautiful:)|`|cDwjaxlGaa	please take my advice. i knew somebody just like you, and they wound up nearly dead in the hospital.  Unless you're shorter than 4'6, 100 lbs is fat. That's only a healthy weight is you're between 4'6 and 5'0. Making yourself throw up will give you stomach ulcers, vocal chord damage, osteoporosis, hair loss, digestive problems, irregular heartbeat, organ and teeth damage, dry skin, and menstrual dysfunction. You will have out of control feelings, mood swings, depression, anxiety, the inability to eat with others, and a poor body image.  If you want a good body, eat healthy and exercise regularly, but don't run miles each day. For you to have a healthy weight, you need to gain at least 12 pounds.  http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/  I would strongly recommend therapy. They can help you with your eating disorder, and you'll feel great about yourself.|`|yXi3M5A3aa	I'm 3 inches taller than you (I'm 5 foot 8) and when I weighed 100 pounds at your age I looked skeletal and sick looking. If you lost 10 pounds in a month all that you would be losing is water that our bodies store. You would not be losing much if any fat at all. It's easy to lose water weight than it is to lose fat. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables and drink lots of water. Do cardio exercises like riding a bike, jump rope and walking in addition to running, but you don't want to over exert yourself. Cut out as much sugar as possible. Don't eat candy and other junk food. So just remember those 10 pounds you lose will mostly be water not fat.    Hope I helped :)|`|L5U2pd2Iaa	Stop right there.

It mostly depends on your height. It may not be your weight--it might be your frame size. I your frame is big then here is no amount of weight you can lose to make you look skinny---you"ll sickly. hwy do you want to be skinny anyway--curves are MUCh better. Trust me, i feel your pain though. Im 14 and I weigh 99 lbs. (im 4'11!) I look a little chubby but guess what-I still fee beautiful at least one a day. Your not ugly trust me. Sorry for this being so long.|`|AA11521202	First, you need to stop worrying about the way your body looks. Everyone is special and different in there own way.    Second, if you are actually "fat", try to talk to someone about it that you know in person, like a friend or your parents, brothers, sisters, etc for help. Studies say that when you have someone else that is there for you to help support you, you are more likely to think and act positively.    Finally, making your self throw up CAN really make you loose weight. HOWEVER, it is very dangerous to make yourself throw up. Making yourself throw up is also called Bulimia, a eating disorder. Making yourself throw up can damage your esophagus due to the stomach acid and damage AND rot your teeth for the same reason!    There are many ways to loose 10 lbs a month, u can easily start my eating healthy food like fruits and vegetables and avoiding fast food!    Coming from a 15 year old boy, you don't need to worry too much about your body. If you honestly think that being 100 lbs at the age of 15 is over weight, ask your health teacher at your high school. They can be a great help! Trust me!    PS: the 2nd link is a site that can help you calculate your body-mass-index, which is like a ratio for healthy weight. It is a little old school, but it can give you a ok idea of how under/normal/over weight you are.|`|yqa2sWY7aa	thats like not funny|`|HmNgL3gMaa	post a picture
9WKDuREDaa	Ughhh I have really fine wavy hair too and the best way to "straighten" it is to wash your hair and blow dry it upside down with a hairbrush, this way it gives you more volume and if you have a round brush you can use it as a curling thing to get your hair flippy while your blow drying it upside down of course. That is how I do it and people think i straighten my hair but its an easy trick and it doesn't do any damage at all! Serisouly, people sho straighten thier hair everyday and then leave it natural another it looks really dry and the texture is strawlike it feels horrible!! Just think of those girls with pin straight hair everyday when they are old grannies YUCK their hair will be a messs! haha hope i helped and good luck!|`|MgVsTOidaa	brush it out while blow drying. also apply a anti-freeze oil.|`|lU4uBYcuaa	After a shower blow-dry you hair down!!|`|0x3hLXoBaa	get some hair  product to put on your hair that protects your hair from heat(hair staighters)    also panteen straight shampoo and condictioner|`|sOlGuPDhaa	ermmm ive nver tried diz but it miiigghht help.  ok like use a wet brush nd den get ur straigtening iron which is not turned on nd just pretend ur straighning ur hair as usual but witout turning da iron on....  itz worth a try :) gud luckkk|`|CL0h1D1faa	good question! well i don't know if they have this in the states, but i had my hair chemically straightened before and it turned out great. my hair would dry completely straight and shiny. so i suggest that you go to a hair salon and ask if they offer such a procedure. i think it's well worth it. and it will stay perfectly straight until your natural hair grows out again after you cut it. it is a long process though.. i was in the chair for like five hours and i couldn't wash my hair for two days in order for the chemicals to do their work. but like i said, it was worth it.|`|0DiqkBzUaa	blow dryer.  Use a large round brush and go through the sections of your hair. then put hairspray in and your ready to go!    or possibly chemically straightening it.  this will last you untill it grows out, but you will have to do something with your wavy roots.|`|w1pbRmazaa	Try using straightening conditioner.    Or flip your hair upside-down while it's wet and brush it that way.    That's what works for me.|`|pcLHKXeXaa	A few years ago, my daughter wanted straightened hair (she has a mild wave) but didn't want a chemical straightener. What the beautician suggested was that she let her comb through a regular mild perm instead. It worked beautifully. It didn't do any obvious damage and straightened it well so that no iron was needed. Now I'm a  nurse, not  a hair pro, so I don't know if this really did less damage than a regular straightener would have done, but it did a great job nonetheless!!!|`|oSAPrV8jaa	well u can blow dry it straight with a brush. or get a perm. or use a curling iron...(just dnt curl it)...    hope i helped=]]|`|vGWD8Zncaa	If there's one thing that's overdone these days, it's STRAIGHTENING hair!    Please consider NOT straightening it.    Wavy hair is beautiful and sexy.  Straight is lifeless and dull by comparison  (no offense to those with naturally straight hair)|`|XzdQzO5Waa	Blow drying works..sometimes. Depends on your hair.    But blow drying is just as bad as straightening, either way it's applying heat. You could get like the opposite of a perm to make it more straight, although those can get pricey. I suggest just straightening your hair 2 or 3 times a week, and don't wash your hair everyday. Everything advises you not to do so anyway, and if you wash it everyday, you'll be straightening it EVERYday making it worse.    And it doesn't have to be stick straight all the time. You can scrunch it, or curl it(still heat, unless you use velcro or foam curlers) or you can put it in a cute updo. Like messy buns and such.    I know a few people who wear their hair STICK straight allll the time, and it looks so boring. Mix it up definitely, and add in accessories like headbands.    I added more than what you asked for, but I hope it helps! :)

Did he have a special something that when you think of him, that's what comes to mind?  I like angel wings, and other types of memorial tattoos, but I always talk my clients through the process, and help them try to personalize the tattoo.  I had a client whose brother was a high school football coach, and it was his life.  When his brother was killed in a  car accident, he wanted to memorialize him with a tattoo.  What we did was put the helmet in the venter of his arm, and put in a grassy base with some lights and bleachers behind it.  On the player's bench, we put a folded jersey, and on top of the jersey sat a playbook.  He worked with his brother to help him write his playbook, and it was a closeness they shared.

There's no other love like the love from a brother.  ~Astrid Alauda      I don't believe an accident of birth makes people sisters or brothers.

AA10297143	At first I wondered why this was in Skin and Body, but I can see enough from the fine print.  One thing is a possible mask, but that might not help honestly, nor may it be desirable to be "covered" all the time.  You may want to check with your dermatologist for professional advice.  I suppose it is not quite clear to me if the dog hair is the culprit to the breaking out, or just irritates what is already broken out.  Either way, keeping foreign objects out of the pores is optimum.  My wife uses skin and body products from http://www.nuskin.com and swears by it.  She has used it on me, such as facials, and occasionally I break out anyway, but she swears by it.  I suppose each person is different also, so no one treatment may necessarily work for all.  Give this site a look see and find out if it is right for you.  Good luck.

jcGnBgAPaa	whenever i apply foundation, i always make sure i start out with a good daily scrub on my face. neutrogena or the apricot scrubs are my favorite. Then use a good moisturizer as a base. i like the bare minerals skin rev-er-upper stuff. after the skin prep, i apply my concealer with a brush and blend it in with a sponge and continue in those steps until i feel i cant get anymore coverage. i then apply foundation and blend with a sponge as well. as with anything you put on you face (i.e powder,compact, foundation) you always want to blend down. blending upwards causes the makeup  to stick onto all the little facial hairs and you can totally see it in light. i hope that helped a little bit.|`|1bb29480284b74b7e53f51936d85c768aa	yea your not doing it right  sounds like your over doing it|`|sbiCl376aa	maybe you are not using the right shade of foundation.. go to a department store and invest in a good foundation.. and ask for help on choosing the right shade :)|`|KTMb7rcvaa	You could be using the wrong shade, maybe too light.

Dont not use the sponges the powder comes with, use a blush brush because with the powder sponge it kinda cakes it on, and with the brush, it makes it spread evenly and lightly.  Good Luck!|`|JOR9dSSuaa	nope, you put powder over your foundation.|`|Q0R8XkZTaa	Well it depends...there is powder foundation and powder concealer...but my guess that the stuff you have is foundation...but throw away L'OREAL cuz it is one of the biggest animal testing companies in the world. Look up animal testing on google and you'll seee what I mean.
VN2wyTnFaa	It'll still cover everything you want to, but with the powder it will more likely give you a more matte look than the liquid foundation. Also, you'll have to set your makeup with a powder after the liquid. Hope that helped! Good luck!|`|VitK0Wenaa	I love powder makeup. It looks more natural, it lasts longer, and it is better for your skin.    Bare minerals, you can't beat it.    In reality, all liquid makeup is is a powder with lotion added to it.  I formulate cosmetics, and I believe powder is better than liquid in every makeup.|`|2mLcZXBYaa	i believe if you use the powder it will have a little lighter tint to it....and with the liquids it would be more natural. Personally i prefer the liquid concealer and powder.|`|TbmcWrMcaa	Too much makeup just looks manky, anyway.|`|7V55yPu9aa	Depending on the brand and the texture. I use to mix foundations and it came out perfect i was offered a job to model for a clothing company called Tilly's that's how awesome I did my makeup! So its all about the brand
BQ8FuBo9aa	i think your fine to do them now...i always did mine one after the other because if you wait to long it starts to heal to that size and makes it much harder to stretch..also good tip : put neosporin with pain relief on your ear and earring before you stretch it...it will definately help with pain and help the earring slide right in...have fun!! these piercings hurt like a *****..|`|1y7FRIexaa	I gauged my ears to a 4g 3 nights ago. I only waited a week or less than that to gauge it to a 4g. And it didnt hurt at all. Plus nothing is wrong with them now. I tried going to a 2g but it hurt so i stayed at a 4.|`|yiZpsEYCaa	I have a 2g and i waited like a week to go up a size thats all|`|eXMI11kkaa	wait for 4 more weeks. going up now will just result in extra scarring.
s4aX6bF6aa	I don't know about a nose piercing...i've never had one...but ear cartilage is no big deal...the worse part is getting the piercing...then it's like an ant bite for a minute or two but then it's no big deal...keep it clean like you're instructed to do so and you won't have any problems at all.|`|Enzb2gQaaa	I had my cartilage pierced last year in April and i was soo scared to get it done, but after it was pierced i was like"that was it?!" lol. it hurt for less than 5 seconds, but u dont want to sleep on it cause it will be sore for a few days. Not long though : )|`|9qSF7zT3aa	On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being worst, I'd say about a 6 or 7, but it's quick. I've never had my cartilage done.|`|m40XxkSvaa	I don't have my nose pierced, but a cartilage piercing doesn't hurt at all. For me the pain was probably a 2. It was way better then I had expected it to be.
VN2wyTnFaa	You don't have to buy both. I'd go with Petticoat though. It's got a little pink to it. Good luck!

2ZsRAxkuaa	Yes its normal, but its worse because the piercing is irritated because bactine is not good for piercings. Really not good, it even says on the bottle, not to use for puncture wounds.<br>  Infections have dark yellow/green smelly pus and hurt like hell. But I don't think its that. You'd be complaining alot more :)<br>  <br>  Ditch the bactine and switch to saline, which is much more gentle. You can either buy it premixed cheaply or mix it yourself.<br>  1/8tsp sea salt in a cup of boiled water, twice a day. Its pretty simple, but make sure to only use sea salt, and not too much. It should taste as salty as tears.<br>  <br>  Soap is good but it has to be very specfic, antimicrobacterial[?] or something like that, I never use it though. Dial soap is generally agreed to be a little too harsh. Satin or provon soap is the best thing to use, although its not really nessecary. Saline does more than enough.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bodyartforms.com/products.asp?jewelry=cleansers&filter=customyes" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodyartforms.com/products.asp...</a>|`|IsRk5ZoVaa	NORMAl.!<br>  ClEAN iT GOOD WiTh MAyBE SOME PEROXidE liKE ONCE EVERy TWO WEEkS OR SO.<br>  bUT iT hAPPENEd TO ME.<br>  MiNE WAS blEEdiNG A liTTlE ANd i GOT A BlOOd STAiN UNdER iT iT WAS PRETTy GROSS TO hAVE bUT ThEN<br>  i ClEANEd iT ANd A COUPlE Of WEEkS  iT WAS GOOd yOU jUSS hAVE tOO bE PANTiENT!<br>  <br>  =]]<br>  AlSO;;<br>  bUT iCE ON iT fOR A GOOd 5 MiNUTES!|`|bCjmjnqgaa	you should be cleaning with with warm water AND dial soap (or a similar unscented antibacterial hand soap- dont think you can use dishwashing soap or something)<br>  <br>  You should also try sea salt solution.

I9OVrlzdaa	I would get a spray tan cuz they look just as good AND are safe! You can get them done at tanning salons or do it with self-tanner.|`|kUhcypC9aa	Spray tan. Healthier and reliable too :) x|`|bCjmjnqgaa	First off you have plenty of time!  <br>  <br>  Get a gradual tan moisturizer like Jergens. (There are store brand ones as well) Make sure you get the one for your complexion, getting the darkest one will not make you tanner- esp if you are fairly pale. <br>  <br>  Exfoliate your skin really well. Use the moisturizer as directed. <br>  <br>  You can go to the tanning bed 1-2 a week. Although sometimes to build your base tan you need to go like 3-5 times a week for the first week. <br>  <br>  If you have never gotten a spray tan, you might want to test it out before the wedding. Mystic Tan has several options for color whereas other brands only have a few options. <br>  <br>  Doing a 'cocktail' yields the most results. Its where you tan in a bed and then get sprayed. If you decide to do that you dont really need to tan in a bed as much as i said ( 1-2 per week full strength) One time should be good. <br>  <br>  Be sure to exfoliate, shave, and moisturize before your spray tan. Or else youll have a spotty orangey tan. Dont get sprayed the morning of the wedding or else it will come off on your dress. <br>  <br>  And keep using the gradual tanner. <br>  <br>  You can use self tanners but that can often be unreliable especially on your chest which will be showing.|`|UnqAjpVOaa	Well, you can get spray on tights for about ￡2.00 not only is it cheap for a can but they look really effective. you can spray it all over your body for a really nice glow, so it looks natural and healthy. It washes off as well so you can re apply it whenever you want it. The overall look is much nicer and much more natural then that of a spray tan booth.|`|pOYpmdtraa	Get someone to airbrush tan you so you know its done right and the coverage is even.  Go to a reputable place

DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT leave makeup on overnight. if you wash your face everynight you shud be just fine|`|ZqoJl7haaa	you could die. and you you will pee many colors!|`|6kXi5Iujaa	If you do not take of mascara, eyeliner, eye shadow.etc..  It can be harmful to your eyes :)|`|bljEhh86aa	Your skin needs to "breathe." It breathes in oxygen and breathes out toxins. Sleep is when our minds and bodies are rejuvenated. Our beauty sleep is between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. Hair and nails grow more quickly during these hours than at any other time of the day. Your skin needs to be free of products which will block your pores and prevent the skin from breathing and inevitably cause breakouts. Think of this...if the skin absorbs ingredients into the blood stream from a patch (i.e., smoking patches or estrogen patches), then your make-up can be absorbed also! Wearing makeup to bed one time ages the skin 4 days!    It is the time before bed when you should give special attention to thoroughly cleansing your skin from the day's dirt, grime and oil build-up and use products which will leave you with a soft, firm, wrinkle-free, luminous complexion in the morning. After cleansing and toning, choose a skin care regimen which works for you and stay with it. Read the ingredients; mineral oil, artificial emulsifiers and perfumes are rejected by the skin and tend to clog the pores. Following my tips, you will wake with soft, beautiful, radiant, untroubled skin|`|aV0QmAOtaa	You would be more prone to acne and probably get wrinkles really early in your life. When you remove your makeup and use a cleanser, your face and pores can breathe. If you leave your makeup on overnight then your pores can get clogged with dirt and oil causing you to break out or damage your skin. Also, the way your skin gets damaged causes fine lines and wrinkles! I recommend getting a cleanser that removes oil, dirt, and makeup or a makeup remover and doing this every night and make it into a habit.|`|6d366995788df4d6f45713e15e220860aa	Pimples, oily skin, or dry skin, flaky skin, bad acne, clogged pores.    Just about everything you don't want!|`|D3Ru7ghsaa	eye makeup can be harmful b/c if anything goes in your eye and you dont notice immediately you can get an infection and thats really bad!|`|Lnw6ZYMoaa	Not really harmful, you just would have a better chance at clogged pores. Also you'd get that gross black gloop in the corner of your eye when you wake up.|`|EL45UeUJaa	Most likely pimples, not necessarily acne, but maybe, especially if you have a problem with that before. It clogs up your pores. It may also age your skin a little if you do not wash it off on a regular basis.|`|VRlhfsfeaa	Acne|`|sBgCUQWzaa	yeah. it'll clog up ur pores and cause major breakouts|`|d5ppt4jFaa	your skin would be completely dry!  there will be a small amount of a signs of breakout but most definately black heads!|`|wSMYGzrQaa	Acne, oily skin, bad or clogged pores, sty's, and generally bad skin|`|4a7f262367ce439921ed41cf674ac9e8aa	Yes. It can be very harmful. We need to cleanse our skin day and night because failing to do so will cause clogged pores and a buildup of bacteria that can lead to acne, black heads and milia. Don't use regular soap because it can leave a residue that needs to be removed from the skin. Use a lathering facial wash followed by a water based moisturizer. The skin repairs itself while you're sleeping so you want the skin to be clean and fresh while it is healing itself.|`|KG3MptIdaa	It depends what is in your makeup. Some chemicals are bad to leave on, but generally if you forget every once in awhile you will be okay. The only problem I ever had was I once had too much mascara on and my eyes watered at night while I slept... when I woke up the tops and bottoms were clumped together. Acne and clogged pores are a given if you left it on all the time. I wear MAC and Lancome... go figure the mascara I had used when it clumped together was from a CVS, waterproof Covergirl or something.|`|claW4UUcaa	no one ever taught me beauty rules when i was younger. i'd cake on makeup and have a horrible base line and go to bed with my makeup on. i have large pores because of black heads. it's gross. i will be getting a good skin treatment with my tax money.     as for the eyeliner and mascara it's ruined pillow cases.

Synthetic is not an option with wet and wavy!Hair that is wavy and can be straighten if need is any hair. but if you are constantly going to go from wavy to straight than you need wet and wavy. it is bought wavy and if you want to straighten knock yourself out. to get it wavy again just add water. sensationnel and outre' are personal fav's (check out their websites) .<br>  The difference between a sew in and interlock is that interlocks are braids. they are beautiful but dont tend to last as long a a full weave. they are very very beautiful though. FYI interlock ad tree braids are the same thing. Depending on your choice of hair (wavy always looks good) it will be natural looking. Synthetic is okay but not for long term use (2 weeks +) Since summer is quickly approaching i would go with the tree braids , but if you are constantly in water than go with wet and wavy!|`|yC9cTgDkaa	The sew ins are not for the tender-head folks, sine you have to braid your real hair tightly, then literally sew in your new hair.

For example, I have CURLY hair, and i need my hair to blend in with the extensions, so if i straighten it, then glue them in or interlock them, it will look great, until it rains, or my natural hair reacts to the humidity.  this will lead to one hot mess!  I would do the sew in, because all of my natural hair is bound up, and all that is left is the beautifully different extensions.  good luck!|`|XH1YkgqPaa	just grow it weaves are itchy and natural hair is always the way to go ;)

26d3xsUNaa	of course have you tried conair hair straightener.That is what i use and it works well.|`|MV0lMuDMaa	You just have to buy an expensive straightener.  I bought cheap ones that didnt work well and broke within a few months.  Id finally had it and bought a really nice one that doesnt damage my hair, keeps it straight, and has lasted for YEARS.  I think it was around 60 dollars and well worth it.|`|uOtZUzNOaa	there's not a healthy way for your hair to straighten it.  you can help prevent damage by getting a heat protective cream.  and you should never straighten your hair wet, you'll fry it.|`|P6KPjt1naa	don't straighten your hair wet. it will fry it. straighten it dry & use a good heat protector. i use V05 heat defense and it works well. good luck!|`|o510SIhGaa	Straightening your hair isn't bad for it as long as you are replenishing the nutrients. At least that's what my hair stylist told me. I use Biolage shampoo and conditioner, and I don't rinse the conditioner out. If you have serious hair like me, it will make your hair beautiful and bouncy!  Good Luck!

Ue9xrUkbaa	Hair-I think, you should mix it up. Days that you are feeling more flirty, wear your hair curly, but days that you are feeling more quiet and serene, then go with the more laid back straight.     Makeup-With curly hair, try a shimmery eye shadow with a little bit of purple. Also try a clear lipgloss that keeps your lips shiny, or try a little of a light pink.   With straight hair, try a light brown, or grey eyeshadow. Also use a light pink or red lip gloss.    Oh and girly, you are gorgeous.|`|zddIYf9vaa	I don't know, they both look good and I cant decide! arg    use them both, I guess :P|`|kknSPYxKaa	Straight.|`|7260c9120059c7fb296cfba63b174bb1aa	omg ur so pretty =) lol well ur hair looks super pretty either way so u should just wear it the way thats easier to do, like wear it however it is naturally. hope i helped, but i think u mite look a tiny bit better with curly|`|jsCjGUPuaa	curly|`|WOqCWAp2aa	well first of all your not ugly. and straight hair looks better on you. and you have Beautiful eyes if you put a bit of eyeliner you will look great.|`|2r5yq35paa	Curly.|`|W8cf9Dxjaa	I can't see it very well in the curly pic..but it's def. cute straight!|`|ilt8pNFWaa	flip or layers, and definitely more cowbell, btw you are smokin hot!!|`|uxuAgrtJaa	defiantly curly!|`|722561d7c12f06d39d643393351ba989aa	your hair isnt really that curly, so i like the curly because it looks kinda like loose waves.|`|AA11586880	I like curls, but you have the shape of face for either.

Qtf205ggaa	The link to your facebook wouldn't work for me. SO I cant tell you if it's a good idea. There are a few things you should know about coloring your hair red though. Red fades super fast. If you wash your hair every day, it might not be the best idea. Its really hard to get a shade of red that you want, because every other color thats in your hair right now will effect it. Also, if you ever decide that you want to go back to whatever color you are now, its hard to do. Unless of course youre going super dark. Red is really hard to get out of your hair. If you have to get  it done in a salon it would probably be considered a color correction and thats pretty expensive.|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	No, I would just add highlights to your color, the way it is. Red, I personally do not think will suit you.  I agree  with 'Rawr', the poster. I am a redhead, and it does fade fast and it is, by personal experience, because I have been red before, incredibly hard to get out of your hair. I really love it though, but she is absolutely correct.|`|2r5yq35paa	The link you gave of yourself doesn't work.|`|KASrZrjjaa	hmm that's kind of a funky color  maybe you should try blonde highlights|`|722561d7c12f06d39d643393351ba989aa	no red doesnt seem like you could pull it off

They are fad fashion and guys (like yourself) try too hard by wearing these things to attract girls. Trashy.   I like a guy who can dress for himself without trying to impress. At the same time sophisticated, mature and sexy.   If you wear clothes that are different from what other guys wear all the time, you will definitely stand out. These things include: Nice fitted denim (ie. guess, diesel), NO Skinny jeans, wear shirts that fit nicely and doesn't have a logo that screams (oh look at me!!! i am wearing ____ ), dress shirts (if you are over 18), i love lacoste polos...  Some male brands I love:  Diesel, guess, fcuk, buffalo is okay too...  club monaco...    They are not pricey compared to AF,AE,Hollister, etc
pXP2QF8raa	It's bad. you do have a slight bump. I was 15 when i had a nose job(3 years ago). I had a slight bump and i also has a bulbous nose. best decision i have ever made! also the hardest. I was so scared b/c i knew myself looking one way, and i was afraid to see how i would look after.  But I'm so much more confident now.  i would recommend a nose job ONLY if you seriously do not feel comfortable with the way your nose looks.    Rhinoplasty was not bad at all! They didn't break my nose, so my face was not very swollen.  Months before I had my tonsils taken out. That was a much more painful surgery.  =]|`|4R93xF8naa	dude what is bad with that???  i can't really tell though without your rest of u face, but i honestly think its cute, seriously i don't see anything bad =] =]  there are some people that have it worst, some people have deformed faces, or are born without a nose, or without an arm.   come on now. its cool. =]|`|W840msNTaa	yea i guess kinda long, should have gave a frontal view.    edit: but its not so bad you need surgery|`|WRXNoZPRaa	kinda...|`|CuhJRewLaa	its fine    but seriously? a nose job? come on|`|HiuZs5G5aa	your weird. for wanting to fix something that isn't wrong. and you are crazy for getting surgury. but do you what you want crazy girl.|`|GBEgFS19aa	honestly, its not that bad  i hate mine :(  its so wide and fat, but heey we all have flaws  just accept who you are,  lol im 15 :)  or just wait until your older to get surgery  but now try to use makeup to shade certain parts and itll look better :)|`|uiGx0rPVaa	Appreciate who u r.|`|KbUIttmqaa	cant tell what it looks like without the rest of your face.|`|KVzDQ19Iaa	It's not bad!

I absolutely hate it.  From, the side view.    But, i live with it.   People look past it.  It's not like, they stare & are like, "ew, you have a huge bump in your nose." or anything.    Tons of people have noses like that; celebrities too. Take a look at Jessica Simpson, for example.    It's fine.   It's cute. (:|`|b4622f67dc5f213bc8a77f62e592cfceaa	don;t worry, your nose is fine. :D|`|6EAgKSRBaa	i hate my nose too.... yours isnt bad id rather have ur nose then my nose... i hate noses sometimes...     haha a lot of noses :] lol    but honestly your nose looks fine  :]|`|A9ZJKa7Haa	It's really crooked but I've seen much worse. Don't worry, it's not bad. However, if you got a smaller nose, it would be much cuter!|`|jYKPvZxWaa	leave it,its fine.youre unique   most people who have surgery end up looking worse in a weird way|`|8yokh359aa	Nope.  It is not bad.   I think your nose is cute, and I bet there are tons of people that have survived car accidents, yet have not been able to salvage their face, would do anything to have your nose.  Or how about that little boy in Iraq, who got his entire face burned off by kidnappers? He has had multiple surgeries and still does not look normal. May be you should stop obsessing, because your looks can be ruined in a split second by an explosion, gun shot wound, or car accident, and I bet you would pay any amount of many to have your nose back, if that happened.  We always take things for granted until they are taken from us, and we always say "I wish I would have realized what I had". You should be grateful for your nose and not going on the internet for approval.

It's not about the worst thing the piercing place can do, it's about the worst thing that your parents can do. If they pierced you and it later turned out that they didn't have legitimate parental consent, your parents can sue the people/company that did the piercing. The piercer is covering their ***, legally speaking, and they aren't going to be flexible on this. You'll just have to wait.

TDFTZcjYaa	well the dumb blonde trend really started with Marilyn Monroe singing happy birthday Mr. President. because she is blonde, it just became a trend to call all blondes dumb. I think that it's a stupid stereotype, and the attractive factor isn't the color of your hair, but what you do with it, how you dress, the tone of your skin, etc. There are blondes who are prettier than brunettes and vice versa. in my opinion, people shouldn't turn away from someone because they're blonde because I know quite a few really smart blondes and they have better personalities than brunettes. the color of your hair has nothing to do with your intelligence or your personality. people who think it does aren't worth your time anyway.|`|HiuZs5G5aa	its just a joke kid. very few people actually beleive that all blonds are dumb. its just that the majority of really really hot blonds are well dumb. so thats were you get the stereotyping from. and believe me there are plenty of dumb brunettes also.|`|sO5KeGu8aa	'cause everyone KNOWS blondes are better and they're just jealous|`|HR08enwgaa	there just jealous  blondes are amazing(:  everyone has there blonde moments|`|24Xy8qWtaa	The second one sounds underweight so I'll go with number one.    And people are stupid, don't worry about it.|`|McjaM0hDaa	i agree (i am a blond and all of them think am the same kinda of girl as in those blond jokes, stupid, and dumb, i hate it!!! ) and they are just jealous because most blonds are way hotter!!! and get more guys!!!!!|`|BNSy3xViaa	probably cause most people think blonde people are less smarter than others..  trust me, i dont make fun of my friends, most of my friends are blonde, but sometimes they have... a lot of blonde moments....even i do... and no, im not saying everyone is less smarter than others...it doesnt matter what type of hair you have for people to call you not smarter than them    hmm...not being mean to blondes( not sterotyping either!) but i go with number 2. just, that's my final answer.|`|VZzdTUtEaa	What are you talking about?|`|WRXNoZPRaa	haha..the 1st one seems better....  im friends with lots of blondes...im not mean to them.|`|fZtWkcTGaa	I don't think blondes are dumb, but I find it comical people do. I mean how can your haircolor make you dumb?|`|781f1b49265b1eed1172c3bab9e54872aa	A blonde was speeding in a 35 mile per hour zone when a local police officer pulled her over and walked up to the car. The officer also happened to be a blonde and she asked for the blonde's driver's license.  The driver searched frantically in her purse for a while and finally said to the blonde policewoman, "What does a driver's license look like?"  Irritated, the blonde cop said, "You dummy, it's got your picture on it!"  The blonde driver frantically searched her purse again and found a small, rectangular mirror down at the bottom. She held it up to her face and said, "Aha! This must be my driver's license" and handed it to the blonde policewoman.  The blonde cop looked in the mirror, handed it back to the driver and said, "You're free to go. And, if I had known you were a police officer too, we could have avoided all of this."

jez0O0bXaa	You need to use bleach or a hi-lift dye. You aren't lifting it up enough to get it past the red stage. You also probably have warm undertones|`|sZUNC9Ghaa	is it a while after u dye it? cuz thats just what happens when u dye ur hair. if u have borwn hair it wont show up and it will turn red probably...:) hope this helps|`|SQjJxaOqaa	it will turn and orange color  unless you bleach it  then dye it the color blonde you want|`|CcXIbqnOaa	What is your original hair color?

FmSSjE1saa	Well with all the dying and straighting your hair is probably damaged. However your hair is not ruined for good. To get your hair back natural get it trimmed evry now and then and quit with the bleachin and dying or the possiblities of your hair falling out will be greater.<br>  Now as for your hair growing. Hair grows about 1/2-1 inch a month. If you want your hair to be bra straped length it'll probably take a few months. Take good care of your hair. Go to the beauty polar    every weeks or so and get a trim every 6 to 8 weeks nd wrap your hair at night. And your hair will get back natural and healthy again. <br>  Hope this helps. =)|`|of049X1waa	You could have ruined your hair by straightening and dyeing it, but it will eventually grow back and be natural again.  Just cut off the parts that are ruined, and the new hair that is growing will be wavy again.  However, it is possible that your hair type has changed as you've grown.  Try to go to a hair salon for a consultation and see if there are products you can use to keep your hair under control.|`|jJDy5zAGaa	You have straightened your hair every day so it have been "trained" to go straight.  Try washing your hair every other day, to minimize drying it out and creating frizz, but condition every day.  Curly or wavy hair tends to be more dry than straight hair.  Get yourself some good, moisture rich, curly hair products and wear your hair "curly" as much as you can.  Your hair must be re-trained to be wavy/curly again.  It will take a few weeks but it will happen.  I just went through this with a client.  If your hair is very thick and heavy try having it lightly thinned and textured to avoid weighing it down and dragging any curl you have out.  Also try to go for regular hair cuts.  I know it sounds counter productive but the dead ends have to come off.  If your hair isn't healthy it will not grow.  Good luck and be patient!

qO2slhk4aa	I've never heard that, but will assume it'd make your hair greasy.|`|sjzUIWEUaa	it will probably just make it super super greasy..|`|AA10241705	If I get frizzy hair and don't have anything else, I'll put some lotion in my hands and lightly run them over the top of my hair to get rid of the frizz. I wouldn't do it a lot, and I don't use a lot, but it does work.|`|d5ppt4jFaa	i dont think thats true, maybe it will make your hair smell good but no it wont help that at all. It will probably make it worse. If you need something to stop frizz control i suggest you buy hair serum its like a clear liquid that u put in your hair and it smells good to depending on the brand i guess. I have one from paul mitchel wich you can find at allot of places its the green clear bottle. :]|`|5duNSD9Caa	it wouldnt be bad if u just put a samll amount of lotion and to your hands and just lightly rub in on your hair ....but most importantly   do not put alot because it will make your hair very greasy.|`|haiQ9dmpaa	Err... that would be really disturbing. I'm not even sure what would happen but it would be extremely messy.|`|10de9a875cf94a4ef7d681f8c14dd791aa	I don't know about that rumor, but I read somewhere that beer can moisturize hair.|`|91D2cLEraa	it works but your hair gets greasy like no ****!|`|AA11119697	Yes, it is true.  I just read Seventeen magazine today and lotion can make you hair less frizzy.  Plus really soft! :)  Just keep it off the roots and it shouldn't be greasy.  Plus my friend has done it because it helps with static. :)|`|Q5gvGAvZaa	i'm not totally sure if you can get pimples on your head but i'm pretty sure you can. i wouldn't go for it. if you want to stop frizzes i 100% recommend aussie 3 minute miracle. trust me, i have major experience with frizzy hair and it works amazingly and isn't expensive. like, at all.  hope this helps! :]]  P.S. its just a conditioner btw. no chemicals.
r2QIbmPIaa	what kind of hair are you talking about exactly?

46fouwFfaa	Yes, it is bad for your hair. Your scalp does not get enough oxygen when you wrap it which can lead to your hair thinning out.|`|GqVaHA7Iaa	wrapping is good for your hair because its not loose and being pulled, matted,or mangles when/if you toss and turn at night.  The main thing to know is that you need to have a satin scarf to wrap your hair in because that keeps moisture in the hair. Cotton and other fabrics dry the hair out. If you don't want to wrap your hair, maybe you just pin it down or pull into a loose pony tail, you should be sleeping on satin pillowcases or buy a satin hair bonnet. Satin is the key.
prdLQhAdaa	I find thongs to be uncomfy, but g strings are comfy for me. You should try wearing g strings. Just make sure they are the right size for you and it wont be uncomfy.|`|bCjmjnqgaa	i dont think they are uncomfortable<br>  in fact i find other types of underwear to be uncomfortable when wearing jeans. like briefs and bikinis. <br>  <br>  i almost always wear a thong or gstring. <br>  <br>  The sizing might not be right or the fabric could be irritating and thats why you feel uncomfortable. If not then you just dont like them. Try other types.|`|nKuf2yl1aa	I hate thongs, no matter what they're made of. Thongs.. G-strings.. basically having something riding up my butt is not the most ideal. And there is nothing more unattractive than the 't-bar'; bending over and the thong sticking out.. yuck!  I  also find thongs are really uncomplimentary to most women's body shapes....<br>   I really like Brazillian cut panties (where just the bottom of the cheeks show). Victoria's secret makes really great ones that are made with 'barely there' material, no panty lines and they are soft as butter.<br>  They are a little pricy, and are 'hand washables' but well worth it in terms of comfort and style; Plus pretty much every bum looks great in them.|`|2IxYVm5oaa	thongs are really comfy !<br>  just buy the right size (not too tight)|`|JiEvzbjVaa	yuck, thongs...maybe they it makes them feel more...bare?<br>  idk|`|9dNEw7etaa	I couldn't disagree more. I think thongs are the most comfortable underwear. I can hardly even feel it when I'm wearing a thong. It seems way more natural to me than other underwear. Also, no panty lines.<br>  <br>  It's possible that you're wearing the wrong size or the wrong fabric. All of my thongs are cotton.|`|of049X1waa	It takes a little while to get used to them... at first they feel like the weirdest thing ever but now I am OK wearing them.|`|VSiVFMiaaa	I only wear them to avoid panty lines or to get my finace in the mood (he LoOoves thongs) but I don't understand how some women actually feel comfortable in them because I've worn them every so often for the past couple of years and have yet to even feel the slightest comfort in them but hey you gotta admit that they are cute- especailly the lacy ones.|`|7tRTZhnLaa	They are the only kind of underwear that I wear.. I don't find them uncomfortable at all, it doesn't even feel like I'm wearing anything. Actually I find regular underwear uncomfortable now that I have been wearing thongs for so long. Maybe you are wearing a size too small.|`|89614f830efdaa2e246b256eff5fd08aaa	thongs are uncomfortable coz they're all up in yur business lol,<br>  how can people actually say they like wearing them?|`|m32WmvP1aa	ive never worn one...<br>  <br>  they just dont seem like they would be comfortable.. but i hear they are
3a3ZTMWDaa	It's okay. I think I'd like it better if it were solid black. I just don't like the roundness of the collar--makes it look a little old ladyish. But, if you are young and wearing it with other funky clothes then that woudn't be an issue. I think it depends on your personal style. The girl in the picture makes it look cool, but if I wore it, I don't think it would look right. The cut on the rest of it is very nice, if you are skinny.|`|sZnHP6Rnaa	i like it. the colors go really good together.|`|zYAQrnjcaa	its ok. reminds me of christmas wrapping paper though.|`|igrdohopaa	Yeah but i don't like the colors|`|hF5599sXaa	i wouldnt wear it!|`|CdGOuEmpaa	not really, sorry!|`|bvnzv923aa	It's an okay coat...|`|hQCyBudFaa	it's okay...but nothing really stands out from it.|`|dFmmFub5aa	I LOVE IT!

The best thing to do is either go with an adult, or just walk into the place very maturely.

pOsV0Tu2aa	For a Bat Mitzvah its not appropriate to wear something that reveals your shoulders.  Wear a strapless dress if you must but wear a cute cardigan over it.  Make sure your dress covers your knees as that will be expected of you.  Judaism is big on modesty and this is your friend's huge day.  She's now a woman and you are lucky enough to witness her becoming a bat mitzvah.  So in respect for your friend and her family, make sure what you wear is modest.  I got my dress for my boyfriend's bar mitzvah at Target and it was 20 dollars. :)|`|79ZD7v4maa	omg my bm is on may 2nd and i dont even know what i'm wearing!!! try NYC thats where im going!|`|ZWUBlIfoaa	a dress lol. see you there|`|ZzXK3nAAaa	It's in a house of worship, so strapless and spaghetti straps are out.

Stereotypes are only for people that WANT to be in stereotypes. The truth of the matter is that you're just...you. It might be hard not being able to put a label on the way you are, but I doubt anyone can (anyone the least bit interesting, anyway).       Congrats on liking good music, by the way :)  I do hope, however...you like the classics...|`|26ecb6a986134f697709409245cb1cdcaa	Emo, i'm guessing you surround yourself with those types of people. Please, think about the people you hang around with!|`|dHmDhp2Caa	well you might be punk!  my friends older bro is punk. most of the time he wears black clothes and he like the people that he likes but i don't think he is much of a people person.  and he even has his own band (i think they got to songs recorded)    so i would go with punk of maybe goth|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	Do you worship evil?

You don't know that they have perfect lives they might be really unhappy off screen. Don't compare your life to celebrities , instead start doing something with your own life so you have something to be proud of . Appearance isn't everything if that's what your referring to

hJmVcWekaa	No no!  Actually i don't really like guys who wear them at all!  Mainly because all the guys i know that wear that are really shallow.  I know that's stereotyping and I'm not saying you are but that's just what i think now when i see a guy who wears hollister or abercrombie.|`|vLF2uz9saa	U have no style|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	That is TOO much. You are trying too hard.   I personally can't stand guys wearing A&F or AE or Hollister all the time because then you know that they are just trying too hard. Because lately it has come to a point that AF or Hollister means you are cool or you are hot. Thus, very tacky. Their clothes are overpriced and not necessarily that great. I don't mind when people wear/have a few pieces from these companies...but when you wear them every freakin' day and keep on talking about it...that gets on my nerves!  Go to Armani Exchange, FCUK, Guess...they are have awesome clothes that are sophisticated and stylish for good value.|`|gcfaO4RMaa	Lol no ew toooo preppy|`|Op37pHd3aa	nope.     i like my guys style varied and something unique.|`|sZUNC9Ghaa	ewww no too prepppy! i hate that! try wearing stuff thats not to preppy!|`|RPz9Wxi9aa	uhh everyday?? nooo|`|pKzuhA7Daa	no, actually im repelled by those kind of guys|`|cIF70lGMaa	yes hollister amercian eagle and a&f are veryyy attractive  but only guess jeans are not their shirts  preppy is hot!  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|O02b6UI7aa	No actually I like it when guys just pretty much dress casual...like just a t-shirt with maybe something on it,jeans, and converse of vans. Occasionally its nice to see guys in Abercrombie and Hollister but not everyday.|`|af113de04b81b474729aa2c6d7e7fcf3aa	This probably won't get me best answer, but I have to say it anyway. Girls who only like guys who wear expensive clothes are shallow and stupid. There is so much more to people than what they look like and how much money they have!|`|P7cbL3F1aa	how old are you???  don't let your clothes be more interesting than you.  fashion is what you adopt when you don't know you.  plain n simple, keep it plain n simple.|`|ppvfgdOpaa	Not me.  I like my men rugged....ambercrombie and hollister is too b!tchy.|`|EBKPbkj7aa	no|`|M9DWMQijaa	Well i like guys who wear fox volcom  and other brands like that   but it mostly depends on the guy|`|OnZdaLE2aa	not everyday mix other brands in there too|`|Xlh0y60uaa	honestly, i think it shows that guys have a little style when they wear name brands. it also shows they respect themselves 2 dress nice, which never hurts when trying to impress a girl. trust me, guys who wear those weird logo shirts can seem immature! soo always dress to impress lOL :P

For me it means that my hair is either too high up on my head, or too tight. So try having your hair a little less tight, and it will hurt less.|`|qKIeshVWaa	it hurts because you're pulling your hair too tight. try some looser hairstyles, like grab a clip and do a funky twist with it. also doesn't hurt to give your head a good massage when you take out your hair.|`|aDElEo4Xaa	you tie it too tight, chill.
Sba9LeYJaa	You could use Hair Loss Protuct to stop it, but the majority of hair loss prevention products on the market do very little to regrow hair. At best, they slow down the process of androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness), and in many cases they don't even do that. Fortunately, I know of an all-natural method for you to prevent further hair loss and to regrow hair--it's called Provillus.     Provillus, an oral supplement, works to block DHT, a form of testosterone that is responsible for 95 percent of hair loss. It also works to stimulate the scalp and bring dead follicles back to life. You can use Provillus as a preventative tool, starting the program before hair loss becomes severe, or you can use it after DHT has already begun to take hold of your hair and scalp.    Their Money-Back Guarantee Results for people who have used leading chemical-based hair loss products are inconsistent. While some people will notice somewhat of a minor change, others will watch as their hair continues to fall out at the same rate. Provillus, on the other hand, has enjoyed consistently positive results by utilizing proven natural substances like saw palmetto, vitamin B6, magnesium, and zinc to attack hair loss from all angles. Plus, because it's all-natural, you won't suffer the physical and sexual side effects that other hair regrowth products cause.     When you order Provillus from them, it comes with a money back guarantee. If you are not pleased with the results you get from their product, you have six months to return it for a full refund. I have started using their product only because of the money back guarantee policy they have but I never use it! And my hair started growing back and much fewer hairs are falling now.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Apply a paste of hot olive oil and 1 teaspoon cinnamon powder before bath and keep for 15 minutes.

When you brush your hair next, keep the amount of hair you have lost and save it until the next time you brush it, if it is roughly the same amount of hair you lose everytime you brush it, you have nothing to worry about.    Also, brittle hair is caused by undernurishment, I would recommend using a body and volume booster.    If you are really worried about it,please go and see a doctor. But im sure you will be okay.|`|SMsprdMfaa	I would say not to use chemicals on your hair.Why don't you go for some home remedies.

Causes of Hair Loss in Women:    Causes of Hair Loss in Women: Help!  I Dont Have to Tear My Hair Out Anymore  Its All Over My Sink!We lose hair everyday, 100-150 strands actually, simply from brushing and manipulating.  If you have long hair, this can look like a lot, but, considering the amount of hair on a head, its a tiny amount.  If hair is coming out in clumps, or you notice circular patches of balding spots, however, there is definitely a problem, and treatment will be based upon the specific cause.The following causes should be investigated if you are experiencing more-than-normal hair loss:  1. Diet:  An unbalanced diet, especially one without enough protein, can cause temporary hair loss.  Women who are anemic often experience loss.  2. Menopause:  Because of the change in hormones during this period, hair loss can escalate, and, unfortunately, this can be permanent.    3. Frequent Shampooing:  Shampoos contain a lathering ingredient called surfactant.  This can be irritating to the scalp and cause itching and scratching, thus increased hair loss.  4. Improper Care:  If you manipulate your hair too much, color and treat too much, blow dry and heat with curling irons and hot rollers too much, you will see increased hair loss.  You need only to look at your bathroom floor, sink and countertops to notice this.  Slow down!  5. Psychological/Physiological Stress:  Increased hair loss can occur with pregnancies, major surgery, or a major life event, such as a death or divorce.  These causes are temporary and hair growth will return to normal eventually.  6. Heredity:  Heredity plays a part and comes from both sides of the family.  7. Other Health Conditions:  Thyroid problems, lupus, and diabetes can accelerate hair loss.  Obviously, these need to be diagnosed by a physician.  8. Alopecia Areata:  This is an autoimmune condition characterized by circular patches of baldness.  Basically, the body is attacking the hair follicles.  Cortisone shots in the affected areas are required, and the earlier the better. http://www.regrow-your-hair-free.com
