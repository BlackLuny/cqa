Where it asks what file(s) to search for, choose all files and folders, and type <*.mp3> (leave out the brackets) ---you can read that as "star dot mp3"---. This will find all the files that have an mp3 extension. You can do the *.file extension for any type of file and the search will find them all.

Qf5Ua6zdaa	Deve essere lungo il "meno possibile"! Sicuramente 1 pò di segnale lo perdi; la visione sarà + "nebbiosa"  e con molti "bruscolini"; 10-12 m. non è pochissimo; poi: è un'antenna centralizzata? E' un'antenna singola? Ha l'amplificatore di segnale? Il segnale è scadente, buono o ottimo? Se è ottimo, perderai poco e puoi prolungarlo tranquillamente; se è pessimo, ti sconsiglio di prolungarlo; la maggiore distanza, fa aumentare la "resistenza" (xkè offre + opposizione al passaggio del segnale televisivo) ed accentua i disturbi sul segnale in arrivo al televisore e peggiora la visione. Il segnale televisivo dipende anche da quant'è distante il ripetitore e di che qualità è; se il segnale arriva "libero", cioè senza ostacoli, sicuramente è buono; se ci sono davanti "palazzoni", alberi e ostacoli vari, il segnale arriverà "debole".<br>  Cmq puoi utilizzare i nuovi cavi da televisione che si usano per le "parabole" del satellite, che è meno dispersivo, offrendo meno "resistenza"; il cavo non deve passare vicino a fonti di calore (aumenterebbe la dispersione del segnale); cerca di non fare "angoli retti" xkè il cavo può subire "danni" con il passare del tempo; cerca di fare il tragitto + corto possibile;<br>  attento alle "connessioni" degli spinotti; cerca di non provocare "corto circuiti" fra "l'anima" del cavetto e la "calza"; fai 1 lavoro "pulito" e tutto andrà bene. buona fortuna; cordialmente.|`|AktKJLUXaa	una perdita sostanziale di qualità si ha, soprattutto, se in casa ci sono tante prese e tante televisioni attaccate (anche mentre sono spente, eh)..<br>  se fai come dici (ammesso che io abbia capito bene) semplicemente prolunghi il cavo che parte dalla tua antenna e arriva in una presa, con un altro cavo piu o meno equivalente..<br>  se fai le cose per bene (e se i cavi e le prese sono in buono stato) dubito che tu possa accorgerti di grosse differenze al punto da dare fastidio nella visualizzazione.<br>  <br>  ciao!!|`|IkX8lJjIaa	La lunghezza non è un grande problema, l'unico accorgimento da adottare, è di non creare molte curve sulla linea ed utilizzare un buon cavo 12/10 con una buona schermatura.|`|J0Ej5LcXaa	Diciamo che fino a 10 metri il segnale resta buono, poi può perdere un pò, ma non è detto.

AbRfd29Haa	A DVD recorder has much the same set of connections as a VHS deck. There are separate groups for input and output. Input signals are for video and audio. Following standards, audio inputs will be on RCA connectors, color-coded red for right-channel and white for left-channel. There is usually a video input, also on an RCA jack, this one yellow. RCA connectors look like this:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_connector" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_connect...</a><br>  <br>  Most DVD recorders will also have an S-Video connector, which is a 4-pin "mini-DIN" circular connector, which looks like this:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Video" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-Video</a><br>  <br>  And finally, any DVD recorder with a tuner inside will have an antenna connector, usually a type called an F-Connector:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_connector" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_connector</a><br>  <br>  To hook your VCR/DVD player to your DVD recorder, you need to match the connectors. Run red, white, and yellow on the VCR/DVD output to red, white, and yellow on the DVD recorder input, if you have them, using standard RCA audio/video cables (good chance one of these came with your DVD recorder). If there are S-Video input/output available, you can use that instead of the yellow cable if you have one of these. All of these cables can be found in any electronics store, Wal-Mart, Sears, Best-Buy, Radio Shack, etc.<br>  <br>  You would set the DVD recorder to record on "video input" or "aux input" or something like that. If you have the manual for it, this is all explained... if not, you may be able to find a PDF of the manual on-line... do a search on the model number of the unit. <br>  <br>  If your VCR/DVD doesn't have video outputs, you can use an RF output (radio frequency)... run an antenna cable (F-connectors) from the output on the VCR/DVD player to the input on the DVD recorder. You probably have to select channels 3 or 4 on the VCR/DVD player, and tune the recorder to that same channel. This will work, but the quality will not be great. <br>  <br>  The DVD recorder will work fine recording any videos you have shot yourself. It probably will NOT record any commercially made VHS tapes or DVDs. There's a copy protection trick, from a company called Macrovision, used on VHS tapes, which modern recording devices will not record. DVD players also create this signal when they're playing a DVD with the "copy protect" bit set.

Qf5Ua6zdaa	il consumo di corrente è possibile xkè la "tensione" (cioè i volt) dall'impropriamente detto "polo positivo" (negli impianti elettrici casalinghi, detto fase, di solito è 1 filo di colore marrone, convenzionalmente inteso ed usato, "ritorna al "polo negativo" convenzionalmente di colore blu o celeste, detto neutro, attraverso 1 Utilizzatore (phon, stufa, frigo, tv, ecc.); ma polo positivo ((nella batteria dell'auto codificato convenzionalmente con il colore ROSSO)) e negativo ((nella batteria dell'auto codificato convenzionalmente con il colore NERO; nella batteria dell'auto è presente una bassa "tensione" (((12 v.))) ed un alto amperaggio (((A. in base alla potenza dell'utilizzatore; es. il climatizzatore consuma molto, anche in auto))) perchè "tensione" e "amperaggio" sono inversamente proporzionali: basso amperaggio, tensione alta, alto amperaggio tensione bassa, ma molta "potenza" utilizzata; sono prerogative solo della corrente continua, cioè, ad esempio di quella circolante nelle automobili nei vari collegamenti degli utilizzatori -luci, indicatori di direzione, climatizzatore ecc.- Negli impianti delle nostre case, dalla "fase" transita fino al "polo negativo" (detto neutro), attraverso un "Utilizzatore" (nell'abitazione: forno a microonde, phon, lampade, tv, radio ecc. come già detto), ciò permette al contatore (sia quello tradizionale, ke a quelli moderni "digitali") di conteggiare il consumo; quindi, come giustamente faceva notare MarissaCoop, se nn c'è una spia di segnalazione accesa sul carica batterie del telefonino inserito nella presa di corrente, nn essendoci differenza di potenziale (ritorno di corrente attraverso 1 utilizzatore, come già detto) fra fase e neutro, NON CONSUMA NIENTE; infatti, se hai notato, quando il telefono è in carica, il carica batterie si scalda fino a ricarica completata; se il caricabatterie del telefonino è semplicemente inserito nella presa di corrente, senza Utilizzatore (in questo caso, telefonino), nn scalda, perkè nn c'è passaggio di tensione, nn c'è consumo di corrente ed il contatore nn è in grado di misurare 1 consumo NULLO e inesistente.<br>  Cmq, II° me, è meglio staccarlo dalla presa di corrente xkè, anke solamente il filo a strasciconi per terra può essere pericoloso xkè possono inciampare tutti, adulti e bambini, donne e vecchi.<br>  Per la differenza fra "tensione" (volt) e "corrente" (ampere), è necessario rifarsi alle varie leggi sull'elettricità scoperte e codificate (molto tempo fa, agli albori della scoperta della corrente elettrica) dai signori Watt,  Joule, Ampere, Alessandro Volta ecc. ecc. ke quì nn è il caso di approfondire.<br>  Cmq, concludendo, se nn c'è passaggio di tensione e corrente attraverso 1  Utilizzatore qls, nn c'è e nn ci può essere consumo di corrente (watt).<br>  Spero di nn averti confuso ancora di +!!<br>  Cordialmente, a. v.|`|NnyoG6llaa	ovviamente sì, perchè gli elettroni presenti si disperdono , anche se in quantità non enormi.E mi dispiace deludere anche MarissaCoop ma è proprio così, e la lucina del televisore che dice lei ti porta via 50-60 Euro l'anno|`|fC3xyHxSaa	dipende da come è fatto internamente il circuito. Conviene comunque staccarlo perchè rimane inutilmente sotto tensione. Se si riscalda anche minimamente vuol dire che una parte di esso è in funzione e qualche circuito sta assorbendo energia e quindi consuma corrente.<br>  In genere è sempre così<br>  Ciao|`|nb229fhtaa	Non credo...però forse sarebbe meglio scollegarlo per evitare possibili danni....|`|7LlaFzLyaa	Se vuoi essere sicuro che non consumi , e che non si rovini , scollegalo è meglio|`|0C6EL4l1aa	Ciao<br>  Ti posso assicurare che esso consuma corrente, piccola, ma consuma.<br>  Questo è il problema che riguarda tutti gli elettrodomestici ed apparecchiature collegate alla rete elettrica.<br>  A meno che esse non abbiano un interruttore di linea o generale, ovvero un interruttore che interrompa o la fase o il neutro (o entrambi), come per esempio le lampade da tavolo (non in bassa tensione), tutte le altre consumano.<br>  All'interno delle apparecchiature, in maniera particolare se sono elettroniche, è presente un circuito di alimentazione dei circuiti elettronici, sia esso realizzato tramite trasformatore o tramite circuiti switching.<br>  Chi ha studiato elettrotecnica saprà che una caratteristica del trasformatore è la potenza a vuoto, ovvero la potenza che esso dissipa rimanendo collegato ad una rete elettrica, dovuta alla costruzione del trasformatore stesso, ed in ogni caso non azzerabile.<br>  Diverso è il discorso dei circuiti switching, essi hanno caratteristiche migliori rispetto al trasformatore (miglior rendimento e minor consumo a vuoto), ma i circuiti elettronici (condensatori, resistenze, induttori, ecc) presenti, anche loro a vuoto dissipano una certa potenza.<br>  <br>  I caricabatterie sono realizzati tramite questi due sistemi, ovvero attraverso alimentazione da trasformatore o circuito switching, quindi dissipano energia.<br>  <br>  Il consumo totale di tali dispositivi che rimangono collegati alla rete elettrica nell'arco di un anno si aggira attorno alle decine di euro di spesa.|`|1BLh9zAaaa	Mio padre dice di sì, quindi (poichè se ne intende) vuol dire che sicuramente la consuma. ; ) Boy90rm|`|d0WEuQTEaa	tutte le spine collegate alla presa consumano corrente, nn importa se il caricabatterie nn è attaccato al cel, lui consuma corrente, qst è niente xke konsuma poko il vero problema è ke il caricabatterie si possa surriscaldare e bruciarsi...|`|jNcJXUKwaa	anche secondo me la consuma.. tanto più che il mio filo (senza il cell attaccato) fa una sorta di fischio....quindi.. staccalo, anche xè se di scaldasse.... meglio evitare danni!|`|sPdBO1Msaa	no nn consuma corrente, a meno che non abbia incorporata la luce di standby. in quel caso si, ma si parla di un consumo mminimo, quanto quello della lucina del televisore!<br>  bye

Dgr5Otkwaa	The colors don't really fade on plasma TVs, and they don't need 'recharging' like some people might claim.  You can rest assured that a new plasma TV from a reputable manufacturer is going to look superb for a long time.<br>  <br>  The TV will have what some people refer to as a 'half-life' which is the amount of time it takes for the total BRIGHTNESS of the set to reduce to half of it's original brightness, but this is not going to affect the colors per se.   Also, this 'half-life' will be affected by the brightness that you have your TV set to on a day to day basis.<br>  <br>  If you are curious about the life of a TV, you can call the manufacturer and ask them.  A decent plasma for a good manufacturer will last you well over 10 years.<br>  <br>  Dave|`|JaD5iiFSaa	We've had our Panasonic plasma 50" TV for several years now, and I haven't noticed any fading of color.  It did break once, when the flow of  household electricity wasn't stable (dunno the terminology, sorry), but connecting a "regulator" device (sorry, dunno what that's called, either) has solved the problem. <br>  I don't know if it's just our model, but it takes a full 3 seconds to change channels---the screen goes black in between channel changes for 3 seconds---that's right, when we channel surf, it takes 3 times longer than it used to with our regular TV.|`|dpmMdb1naa	If you buy a high definition one than yeah its worth it.  I have a 1080p samsung and Im quite impress.  I have one for the livingroom and the bedroom.  Im not sure how long it takes to fade but Im guess around like 5 years or so....depending on how much you use it.|`|7ZMY9L67aa	When you are buying a TV there are a few things to think about<br>  <br>  (1)- will you be playing a lot of video games<br>  (2)- do you watch a lot of sports, racing, baseball, football.<br>  (3)- do you watch a lot of action moves<br>  <br>  If so then go plasma, plasma TV sets don't have a motion blur problem like LCD sets do especially when playing games and watching sports you will see a difference. <br>  As far as color fading goes i wouldn't worry about it.<br>  average life span is 10-12 years but accidents and manufacturing errors do happen.<br>  and the nice thing is Plasma sets are typically less expensive to buy.<br>  I recommend Samsung plasmas.<br>  Any further questions feel free to call<br>  <br>

At first I loved it loved everything about it. But I text alot and after a while it got on my nerves since everything was a touch screen. If you like the touch screen and dont text much then its a good phone. I ended up switching mine for the lg chocolate 3. I didnt want a flip phone but decided it was best for me.|`|6B7XB3fQaa	they are pretty okay, but the touch screen kinda sux, you have to make sure it's calibrated or else it doesnt work right

fwdsp3dVaa	N64 is a Standard Definition game console and your 52" LCD is High Definition! Your TV has to upscale the game resolution to the LCD's native resolution. This will make it look bad, especially on a 52" TV!<br>  <br>  I would play the N64 on a smaller LCD, like 19" or 26" instead. It will look a little better, but not as good as your 36" CRT TV.<br>  <br>  A Xbox 360 or PS3 would look awesome on a 52" TV though!!!|`|AA12041546	LOLZ!! <br>  Just picturing Jason sitting down to a hardcore game of Mario.<br>  <br>  But the guy above is right, composite connections look like shite on a 52" HDTV.

wUg7iYU1aa	damn a kid has a 37' TV....well im sure your the one that bought him his TV and XBOX, so really who can you blame. Either way if he is about to get an operation im sure he has alot on his mind, and playing video games is alot better than out drinking and getting into trouble, so make him earn his playing time by doing some chores around the house, may make you feel better about the situation.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	ok, you can put parental control into the xbox so your son can play for a limited time<br>  therefore, it will save some cost.<br>  and after your sons operation, dont let him touch the xbox for a period|`|qGh1HhPwaa	"My son is waiting for an operation and cannot walk far"<br>  Special temporary circumstances mean temporary special rules<br>  After the operation, kick him outside, no electric|`|AA10341097	a TV being on or the xbox does not take up that much power, sure maybe if it is on 24/7 but I'm sure there are different things in the house that ARE on 24/7.<br>  <br>  if he cannot walk, sorry to say but it is sort of mean to take away the one thing that is seriously keeping his spirits high and occupied. Video games are great for a person who can;t walk. Not really waisting your time when you cant really be doing much more with that time.<br>  <br>  Disconnecting him from Live but still letting him play the console makes no sense at all because playing the xbox "on live" does not add or subtract any power usage, when playing on live he is basically just using the internet that you are already paying for so makes no sense to let him play the console but not on live for the reasons you specified<br>  <br>  Overall, ya, you are being somewhat unreasonable|`|J6InMmqIaa	I usually play 2 hours, too much playing is not good. At least make him pause after an 1 or 2, anyway you′re not being unreasonable. <br>  <br>  Make him watch tv, talk to you, play cards, sleep or something else just as long as he pauses then everything is okay. <br>  Talk to him about the electric bill, that′s the worst thing that can happen if you can′t pay it.|`|AA11758665	12 to 15 hours a day is to much for a kid even if he cant walk make him do something anything else.|`|EH433qfRaa	get one of these, just plug in before the power board<br>  :)
5IUnzlgwaa	I phone makes you buy the bundle they wont sell you the one with an active contract without that bundle added on because sooner or later you will be downloading programs and all that to the phone which will raise your data up real quick.

eZDoQPg8aa	If your TV is an LCD, that's the nature of the beast.  The fastest processing LCD only runs at 120 Hz.  And there are still a lot of 60 Hz units on the market.  <br>  <br>  Plasma runs at 480 Hz but some people hesitate to use them for gaming because they are afraid they will burn in.  Panasonic has a special feature that helps prevent any such issues; I don't know about other manufacturers.  However, if you exercise reasonable care and do not leave the game paused for more than a few minutes, you will not have an issue.<br>  <br>  There are some new, faster processing LCD units coming some as early as this year but they are going to be pricey because they are the latest and the greatest.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	This sounds like a processing issue.  Are you sending the PS3 directly to the TV or do you have a surround sound system?  If you're sending it through a cheap surround system you can get lag.

jhNUuz0maa	Possible ways he might have done it. If you have an online account, that tracks the text message, he could have hacked that and got the messages. <br>  He could have cloned the phone, which means, anything sent or received, even a call, he could have listened into. <br>  <br>  Either way its illegal, like federally illegal. He can do jail time for it.<br>  What I would do, change your number, that way it will be a little more difficult for him to do anything. Then, tell him verbally in front of witnesses to leave you alone. If he still does it, then contact the police and put a restraining order against him. If he breaks that, he will go to jail. He can't make your life worse, so you shouldn't be afraid of him. If he makes any threats or contacts you, document what he said or did.

SKkE3fK1aa	She can after getting it unlocked. My advice to you is to just buy the Samsung Omnia from a Samsung Store rather than your from your Network Service (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, etc.).<br>  <br>  If you buy a phone from any Network Service, then it will be locked to that network service. Meaning, that the phone can only be used with a SIM Card from that network.<br>  <br>  If you buy it from Samsung Stores or their retailers, then it will be considered unlocked and therefore you can use any SIM card on it. Also, expect it to be more expensive when you buy in the Samsung Store because you are actually paying for all of it's licenses and rights, unlike when you get in a contract and get the phone.|`|8xjXERVcaa	Yes she can. Samsung Omnia is a phone which will work worldwide.|`|9jyVD565aa	you can use the international version of omnia, code i900 instead of i910.|`|CFPNtjuBaa	yes you can as it is 3g Quad band and it will work

3CJAUyqPaa	The Sony HDR-XR200V saves high definition, highly compressed AVCHD compressed, video files.<br>  <br>  Drag and drop is the correct method - but what you did not tell us is the version of FinalCut you ar using. Only the CURRENT version of FinalCut running on an Intel-chip based Mac will work - Your MacBook Pro is Intel-chip based.<br>  <br>  If what you mean by "HD" is "high definition", no, it is NOT true that all HD camcorders don't work with Macintosh computer. I have been editing HDV video from my Sony HDR-HC1 and HDR-FX1 for years.<br>  <br>  If what you mean by "HD" is hard disc drive camcorders, that acronym is HDD. I have edited video from standard definition HDD camcorders and FireStore external drives on my Macs for years.<br>  <br>  The issue here is the high definition video format used by the HDR-XR200V - AVCHD. It is a relatively new format - if you meet the FinalCut version requirements (you already meet the Intel-chip requirement), then you are good to go.<br>  <br>  The software included in the box of any consumer based camcorder is useless - even for Windows or Vista.

The fact that they may have backlog problems is not your fault.<br>  <br>  I would be inclined to call sales and explain that if they are unable to fulfil their side of the contract then you wish to cancel.<br>  If you are happy with the deal you are getting on line rental and it's just the delivery time that is an issue I would be inclined to ask for a pro rata refund of line rental to cover the period you have been without your phone. You may also feel inclined to ask for an additional token of good will for the inconvenience ( phone calls etc).|`|0PQdeKzaaa	Hi Debbie what you need to do is speak to vodafone about this & when you do dont let them fob you off because at the end of the day if you've taken out a contract with them they will be charging you from the date you took that contract out so theres 2 weeks without a phone & i bet they will still charge you for the line rental (which your not getting) what you need to do is give them an ultimatun either you get the phone like tomorrow or your take your custom elsewhere also threaten to go go to either (am not sure which 1 it is) offcom or offtel these people are the fair trading for telecomunications they will get it sorted for you ! if vodafone are quick enough to have your custom they should be quick enough to sort your phone out ... hope this info helps<br>  <br>  try this site it will take you to the ofcom website & because you've got a justified complaint these will help you <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.telecomsadvice.org.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.telecomsadvice.org.uk</a>
TbTO5SXlaa	First, always remember this: "It isn't the camera, its the photographer."<br>  <br>  A person knowledgeable about light and composition and f-stops and ISO and shutter speeds and skilled in their use will use either camera to make good pictures. A person who lacks that knowledge and skill will use either camera to make bad pictures.<br>  <br>  Lets compare a few features and benefits of the A200. First, it has Sony's version of Image Stabilization (IS) in the camera body. Any lens used will thus become an IS lens. The A200 can use every Minolta Maxxum AF lens made since 1985. I counted 61 Maxxum/Sony lenses on the wikipedia site. Then there are the third-party lenses made for the Maxxum by Vivitar, Tamron and Tokina. A 20 yeard old Maxxum AF lens used on the A200 will be an IS lens.<br>  <br>  Canon and Nikon have their versions of IS in select lenses. Not every lens they offer has it. Plus, you get to pay for the IS every time you buy an IS lens. Nikon and Canon also have great backward lens compatibility but that 20 yr. old Nikon or Canon lens won't be an IS lens. <br>  <br>  If you can stretch your budget by around $100.00 you can upgrade to the Sony A300 which has Live View that actually works with the auto focus. Suppose you're at a parade and the only way to get a picture is to hold the camera over your head. With the A300 you just flip the screen down and you can compose, check focus and shoot - all while holding the camera over your head. If you like macro photography and are shooting close to the ground, just flip the screen up, compose, etc.<br>  <br>  My vote is for either the A200 or A300.<br>  <br>  The A200 with 18-70mm lens is $499.99 at B&H. The A300 with 18-70mm lens is $599.99 at B&H. <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bhphotovideo.com</a> B&H has a 6 month rating of 9.67 and a lifetime rating of 9.50 at Reseller Ratings <a href="http://www.resellerratings.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.resellerratings.com</a><br>  <br>  If you have any doubts about an on-line seller just check them at that site.|`|6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	In terms of image quality etc, the 450D is without a doubt, THE better camera.|`|DESsW5xqaa	The specs are pretty similar. The Canon one has higher resolution, but the sensor size in both cameras are pretty close, so that shouldn't make a huge difference by itself as far as image quality goes.<br>  <br>  Besides the specs, the real deciding factors should be these:<br>  You should think about whether you need any particular lenses and which camera will work with the lenses you want.<br>  <br>  Go to a store that lets you compare the two hands on. Which one feels better in your hands?

They are in constant contact with the nearest cell tower in a receiving mode and thus are transmitting a locator signal to the tower so it can find it in case a call comes in. it is easier to track the phone while you are using it but it can still be done while the phone is on but not in use.

"Oh, My dog is dead and I think you should credit me for my loss" Nextel representative answer "Oh I really sorry for your loss, $50 credit is good for you?"<br>  <br>  No more! <br>  <br>  Now Nextel is under Sprint's policy and they will gave only credits for Real problems, not for satisfy STUPD customers.|`|ae22a3c3fce8c3af162362c74ac63233aa	Sprint is HORRIBLE I switched from Sprint to Nextel then Sprint bought Nextel and the service sucked as bad as Sprint after about a month so I paid them their vig and switched to Verizon all is well now and I kept my # look into it Sprint has been Horrible from the word go and now they have ruined Nextel.
8920a3b688a26671c8ba167adf87b869aa	Hmm, I'll try to refrain from pointing you to the illegal material itself. But the software you're looking for is bittorrent. There's a variety of them, like utorrent, azureus, and bitcomet. I suggest utorrent since it's compact and simple to use. If you look more into bittorrent and how they work, you might be able to find some sites that offer you the files your looking for.<br>  <br>  *hint, a keyword to look for in google is "bittorrent tracker"<br>  just a side note, don't bother looking for it at bittorrent.com, they've got nothing.<br>  <br>  hope i haven't made it confusing or made more work  for you.
AA10979665	Turn your computer off first. Disconnect the old mouse and connect the new one, then turn your computer back on. A window should pop up saying something about 'new hardware,' so just follow the onscreen instructions.|`|1c3e40f2292d26520cd59165ed54c2fcaa	I think your best bet is to go online, buy another mouse, and show your dad the receipt for it--it shows that you are responsible enough to buy another one (assuming you broke it in the first place).  Be honest--it should save you a ton of aggravation.  Good luck.|`|AA11805240	use the enter button to click

If that doesn't work, buy some electrical contact cleaner and spray the contacts in the game cartridge, then wipe with a q-tip and allow to dry. Do the same with the snes, just make sure it's unplugged and has enough time to dry. Doing this should make things work, if not then something inside has broken.|`|b50087bc26ca1056b59dcf138f56bce8aa	basically what i do is blow in the game and blow in the machine both pretty hard, and see if that works, i also turn the system on like 3 times to see if it works. if not i hit the machine a little and then it usually works.|`|02b28130d353316928b55536d986b637aa	I have just the thing for you. Just use a little rubbing alcohol on your q-tip when you clean it, and let it dry for about 15 minutes and it should be alright, if not repeat the same thing. I am a big fan of Nintendo my self.

Blowing inside of the cartridge area works well, and placing the game in at a straight angle, and sometimes being a bit rough. If not, blow inside the console. If still nothing, ask Nintendo. they have useful free numbers.|`|df4369cce56fff331347939a21e784c9aa	I STRONGLY AGREE WITH LEA. <br>  I have an SNES myself and the way you clean the cartridges is to get a q-tip, dip it alcohol and rub it on the outer part of the cartridge. Then wait ten-fifteen minutes for it to dry (make sure it is shiny). DO NOT BLOW ON IT. that causes moisture from your breath to seep into the protected part of the chip. But the alcohol thing should work like a charm. :]|`|fe1a8ac1a9b5073102ab37d4abb0d57eaa	gaming consoles before 2001 (ps2) werent designed to last more then a decade. the ps3 however is designed to be more advanced then any console for 10 years. and the nintendo wii is cheap and good for about 7 years and the xbox 360 is good for about 5 years and the xbox/ps2 will be obsolete in 3 more years when something new comes out. after there is 2 sequals to a game it is obsolete. yeah you can buy a retro release super nintendo on ebay but its gonna cost a pretty penny.

While it is advantageous to own an iPod, it is not necessary.  iTunes will allow you to burn any of your purchased music onto a CD.  So yes, just having a computer is enough.  It's a free download, no purchasing requirements necessary, so feel free to try it out!
b7ec286ba36c5c040ddf9f2ef86e6c3eaa	yeah, lilwhitekid41 is right.  You can also go to the library tab in limewire itself and change it before importing it to itunes.  But you still have to do regardless of whether you do it before or after it's in itunes.  I just right-click on the song and hit the "get info" then click the second tab "info" and you can add all your stuff from there|`|8cc30f1029cd73207f290e48b2383af3aa	this does happen to certain songs to me as well but when I transfer them to itunes I always check how they came up and if they came up bad I right click, hit get info and a window will pop up, if not already hit the tab at the top of the new window that says info and you can edit the name artist album etc. manually I dont think there is anyway that you can change the format

3d1633405645c01eeef71f063cb96efdaa	Favorite 360 game right now is Rainbow Six Vegas.  I have a bunch of other games that I am trading in today at the store I work for.  They include Gears of War, Ninety Nine Nights, and Call of Duty 3.  Beautiful games but I hardly play them and would rather put the money toward Battlestations: Midway and some Wii games.|`|5f4df2ffe569bc597788d527180fad6daa	My favorite 360 game is dead rising. I love it because, well frankly its a bunch of zombies in a mall, you can kill them 1,000 different ways, the story is grand and its replayable. <br>  BUY IT if you like open ended zombie killing awesomeness|`|IZTG16e3aa	Mine is either PGR3 or Deadrising|`|fMJFTqX9aa	My favorite retail game would probably be Gears of War because its amazing in every way with such high production values.  I do have to say that I have a lot of other games that could be put in number 2 or tie for number 1 like R6: Vegas, CoD2, or Splinter Cell: DA.  My favorite arcade game is Lumines Live though (yes I bought it).  I just LOVE Lumines, the gameplay is absolutely fantastic and I have both for the PSP :)|`|pLOXLTFsaa	I dont have one but every one's talking about oblivian.|`|q36FuQjyaa	Um for the 360 it would have to be Halo3 or Halo Wars!<br>  <br>  For regualar xbox that i still play on my 360 it would have to be:<br>  Halo<br>  Halo2<br>  (as you can see im a Halo addict)|`|29fa2f5d1b523e24c5ee82c851d681e6aa	Gears of War.

Microsoft is pretty quick at fixing your system, if they can't fix it they'll send you a new xbox. Hopefully you kept your receipt or else your out of luck. get a intercooler as well.

They are not locked to one server eg. vodaphone.<br>   Often when you buy a phone it will be brought through a phone company, or server and you can not change who you want to provide you with a connection service (the biller). So an unlocked phone means you will have the freedom to choose what company you want your phone to connect to so you can start making and receiving calls or messages. You can choose any company so look for the one with the best service and cheapest rates.|`|GV8fCnabaa	(Tha Hottie) is completely wrong. An unlocked phone means that it can be used with any cell phone company.<br>  <br>  There are two competing technologies for cellphones., GSM and CDMA. If you are buying a phone on ebay, it probably uses GSM technology, like Cingular/AT&T, or T-Mobile. You cannot use a cellphone with one technology with a carrier that doesn't support it. It's like sticking a DVD in a VCR. It just doesn't work. If its not unlocked, it means it can only be used on one cellphone carrier. For example, if it is locked by Cingular, it means that it can ONLY be used with Cingular. <br>  <br>  After you buy the phone, you go to a cellphone store and buy a simcard, so you can get service. a SIM card is necessary for service.|`|07d79fdb7c260e4cf7b58f7d0dd6e140aa	Hi,<br>  An unlocked phone,is It can work with any cellphone company that DOESENT USE SIM CARDS.Such as Alltel,and or verizon wireless.And a locked phone,is where It can ONLY work with phone companys that the phone is assigned to.|`|VdRmngBPaa	It means you can use any service providers sim card.|`|e3052b2263d61d33a9ba08c89baf9588aa	means that it can be used by all the sim card networks

Gdrt18TPaa	I work in special events as well as audio visual. <br>  <br>  I would only recommend Shure wireless mics. The ones that you are looking for are called either a lapel or lavelier mic. <br>  <br>  Stay away from cheaper brands and Radio Shack models because they pic up more noise and feedback more often. (Feedback is the squeeling sound that you hear on microphones usually when people walk too close to the speakers) <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shure.com/ProAudio/Products/WirelessMicrophones/us_pro_PGX14-93_content" rel="nofollow">http://www.shure.com/ProAudio/Products/W...</a><br>  <br>  You'll find that Shure brands are widely used by professionals in the industry and are considered a standard due to their quality, ease of use, and durability.<br>  <br>  Of course - what you plug the mic into (hotel ballroom speakers for example) will make a huge difference on any mic. So if you're considering more than just a mic, consider buying a couple of powered speakers from either JBL or Mackie. This makes it better for you to control the sound. Hotel ballroom speakers are never recommended to patch into. <br>  <br>  Find a professional audio store near you and get them to show you the items that I've listed as well as other options. Again - stay away from Radio Shack or consumer electronic stores because after you buy, you will not have any support and they usually have no idea what they're talking about when it comes to pro-audio, or even general audio! haha. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|915c07cba2714fd5de19058ef8faf54baa	so are you looking for a wireless microphone or a complete system ?<br>  <br>  suggest going to local music store that deals in public address equipment , they woudl have access to information and catalogus for this type of equipment.<br>  you might also be able to rent something to try before you buy.<br>  <br>  they can match up room size and your needs and budget
