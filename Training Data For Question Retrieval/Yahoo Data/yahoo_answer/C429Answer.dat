It wasn't an option to replace it from under the bath.  <br>  <br>  We removed all the fixtures (sink cabinets, toilet), cut out the rotten wood and replaced it with new, thick, treated plywood.  We sanded and puttied to level and then laid the floor.<br>  <br>  As for the source of the leak, I would have to see the leak for my own 2 eyes before setting everything in tile.  It may be the temperature device itself is defective...if it's as simple as some caulk, you're a very lucky person!  <br>  <br>  Personally, I like to replace plumbing fixtures whenever it's convenient to me.  We change the water faucets, etc. every few years.  You wouldn't want to get it all fixed up and find it's still leaking.<br>  <br>  I find all sorts of stuff when I tear up a bathroom.

f4OB1XIHaa	Wow! Do you have a push broom of any sort? I reside in Pennsylvania and it gets pretty nasty during winter, too. I use a push broom to clear my path ways and a snow blower to clear the snow in my drive way. But when doing this, I have my uncle to help me. Snow is thick and heavy. Take caution in doing this so that you won't suffer any health ailments - (i.e.: heart attack, stroke,etc.). A few weeks ago, this woman who resides outside of Pittsburgh was shoveling her side walks and drive way. She was outside too long and suffered a massive stroke! Yep!

y31mee4Faa	You can't get rid of them, but you can remove or reduce them from sound output, though I have no idea where the filters might be available today.<br>  <br>  What you need are filters that clip sound at different frequencies, i.e., scratch, pop & rumble filters.  When vinyl was the recording medium, you could get these add-on filters most anywhere, ready-built or kits to build yourself.<br>  <br>  They were called band-pass filters & could be added to systems that didn't come with this circuitry already built in.  Hi-cut filters filtered out the hisses, scratches & pops, while low-cut filters worked on the rumble (mechanical sound) produced by lower-end turntables...better turntables usually had their own damping capabilities built in.<br>  <br>  You might have to build your own or, if you're not handy around electronics, have someone build them for you.<br>  <br>  Here's a schematic:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ethanwiner.com/filters.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ethanwiner.com/filters.html</a><br>  <br>  Try adjusting your tone controls, bass & treble, they're basically adjustable filters.<br>  <br>  If you are trying to record from vinyl records, I'm almost positive Nero Pro has frequency filtering capabilities.<br>  <br>  Since much of the technology for the filtering you need has grown whiskers, I'd suggest researching scratch-filters-for-records, with the dashes.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck...|`|jiwTWNNtaa	Always make sure the needle is clean, it will collect tiny dust bunnies.

AA12139345	"Frame is still around it" -- if you mean the framework for pouring it... I take it you just did this yourself?  You have to use a good float on the surface (while it is wet) to achieve a smooth finish.  A 'brushed' surface is good for sidewalks, etc, to prevent falling when it is wet or icy.<br>  <br>  If you didn't float the surface properly, your best bet is probably going to be to go with a self-leveling compound, or epoxy.  There are companies that specialize in epoxy finishes, and there is quite a variety of looks you can achieve.  <br>  <br>  Here is a search link to suppliers and businesses - <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=utf-8&fr=slv8-msgr&p=epoxy%20resurfacing&type=">http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=utf-8&...</a><br>  <br>  Have Fun|`|wX3P9Tlcaa	here is a product it is a polymer don't know anything about it or how long it lasts ,similar products i have seen used in a manufacturing setting worked well ,i don't know about outside,you also might find a company that can grind it smooth.|`|jTHJhy2laa	Spray the concrete with muriatic acid.This will begin to eat away the surface of the concrete.When the foaming stops use a garden hose to wash away the acid.It will kill the grass it contacts but that can be reseeded easily.Find a concrete mix that has no aggregate in it and mix per instructions on the bag.Cover the slab with the new concrete and use a float to smooth it.continue to float it until it has the finish you desire.Remember that if it is too smooth you could slip if it is wet or icy.Or you can stop before you add the new concrete and leave the aggregate exposed on the slab.This will be a nonslip surface if that is important or a problem where you live.<br>  I worked for a couple of years for a concrete contractor and that's what we did for several customers.|`|zM9Lj21waa	there are companies that can grind the surface but you may find the end result a little slippery. may want an outdoor carpet on top of that or a spray on non-slip covering like a rhino lining...if the slab is in good shape and height is no concern, pick up the forms a couple of inches and pour a peagravel mix of new concrete on top...

Personally I think I'd choose a pale blue or pale yellow/sand type color.. something like that. You can always spice it up with what you put on the walls, and change that as much as you like.|`|fI2uesEwaa	You could think of your favorite colors, and maybe paint two walls one color, and two more another color. Brighter colors feel happier, and draw more light into the room. You could also go with a color scheme. Use colors that just go well together. (obviously) Things like blue and green, or teal. Red and orange, maybe yellow. Teal and brown go well together, but not everyone really likes it.

If the kids are real young then I would plan on having  them go to grandmas or some where ( you to) if your sensitive to odors.  It can be bad of not noticeable at all. Every carpet is different.  Plan ahead and have windows open and fan blowing out after but not during since some carpets need the warmth to stay "pliable" to work with and be able to stretch it in properly..  Do plan on vacuuming several times.  So have vacuum bags on hand..  Piling and fuzzing is VERY common in staple products ( most carpets are).

Then use some type of hook or wall anchor to put in the hole and pull it out. Otherwise I would even suggest drilling it a few times to try to break it up.|`|mpCDEoriaa	Buy a small plumbing torch from home depot or lowes and melt the damn thing out. Just avoid putting too much heat on the toilet itself. It shouldnt take long at all.|`|691YPESOaa	drill in it a couple of times, and try to bust the bottle into little pieces.|`|pP5BWrCDaa	A good approach may be to duplicate but reverse the initial condition. In other words, if you already have the toilet pulled you can flip it upside down in your tub. Once you have it there you can either use a shower sprayer or other water source (possibly connecting a water hose to a lavatory faucet). Home Depot sells an aerator adapter for just such a task. If nothing else pour water back through with a bucket. After procuring a water source simply let it flow in the reverse of normal direction. The bottle got in that way. The same size should be able to go back through. The oscilation that water flow causes will cause the bottle to dislodge in the same manner it became lodged. I've actually been in this situation several times. I tried all the same things that were suggested above until I tried this way. I usually just carry the toilet outside & blow it out with a pressure nozzle now. Anyhow, good luck & please don't use those pills :)

8apA3Rffaa	As you might suspect anything you put down . will be bumpy and the humps/ bumps will telescope thru and show..depending on just how bad and lumpy It is you can either use a floor patch such as Ardex or dependable to smooth out the rough spots or re applying self leveling compound and mixing it right so it flows smooth. When self leveling compound is mixed right it ll look like thick water and pore and run all over the place. I m wondering if you put in 4 parts compound and 1 part water? It s the other way around.    Anyway what every you do DON T  sand all this down as 1 poster suggested. obviously they ve never done it  to tile thin set ...  You ll be cleaning dust for the next 5 years..  You will have to get the dust thats there now off the floor by mopping or going over it on hands and knees w/ a sponge and water,  this may have to be done a couple of times...<br>      You don t say if you over cement or a wood substrate,If over cement your probably going at it the right way.

Also those self adhesive tiles are not that good anyway even with favorable conditions.|`|umhjqZwLaa	your best bet is to sand the floor down level. then you must,and i mean must, remove all of the dust and debris from the floor. vaccum and mop .the floor has to be clean before any compound will stick.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	I have another idea altogether, which will avoid the sticking problem. Home Depot sells vinyl planks which stick to themselves but not the floor. They're pretty cheap and look good. Check them out. I have them and love them.<br>  <br>  Whatever you put down, if it's vinyl you need a smooth surface. If it's bumpy, those bumps will show through the floor eventually and look like hell. You may need to apply more levelling compound, with a very wide applicator is best, then scrape with the same tool, then sand with a wide sanding block(the kind used for drywall is good), then vacuum really well. You'll have to do all this for any vinyl. <br>  <br>  The other thing you could do to get a smooth surface is to put down some plywood or particle board-type underlayment. Ask at the building supply store what kind is best for your situation.

yHI6rfeUaa	You have talked about different things.  <br>  <br>  1.  You cannot convert polyethylene (PE) in to chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) in your environment.  Polyethylene is a polymer made by polymerization of ethylene.  Chlorinated polyvinyl chloride is made from polyvinyl chloride.  Polyvinyl chloride is made by polymerization of vinyl chloride.  End products of polyethylene and of chlorinated polyvinyl chloride have markedly different properties as they are markedly different in their chemical composition.<br>  <br>  2.  PEX is cross linked polyethylene.  The cross linking of the linear polyethylene chains makes a markedly different product with markedly different properties than polyethylene - as they are markedly different in their chemical composition.  This is why brass compression fittings fail to perform with PE but perform with PEX - they are markedly different materials.<br>  <br>  3.  Although you did not ask, you cannot convert Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to CPVC.  The process entails substantial chlorination of PVC forming CPVC and HCl.  This chemically intense operation requires substantial processing equipment, technically proficient personnel, etc.  It is performed on the PVC resin prior to converting the resin into end product.  CPVC has properties that distinguish it markedly from PVC as well.<br>  <br>  I know you don't want to hear it, but if you want the performance of PEX or CPVC you need to physically remove and replace.  Surely a lot of work but this is the only choice.|`|bg86ji6naa	there are all types of fittings to convert one type to another.

Typical house wiring is 15-20 amps in a circuit.(you can determine which by looking at the circuit breaker)   If your total exceeds the rating of the circuit, you'll need to find a separate line for your fourth lamp.

wKQbNvm9aa	How well does the staple gun work on something else that is easy to staple into?   Try it on some nice soft wood and if there is a problem, it must be 1) bad staple gun or 2) bad staples.   I found when reupholstering that there were all kinds of problems with the staple gun because the wood is so hard.  And I am not that strong and it is hard to hold the gun really tight up against the wood.   I have the best luck with an electric staple gun, though it is not perfect.  I am sure that professionals use pneumatic staple guns or something of that sort.<br>  <br>  <br>  The 'very hard to squeeze' part sounds familiar.  The electric one I have is 'Arrow Electro-matic' and I have had it a few years and it was not expensive when I got it.   It takes less strength to shoot than the regular variety.  Arrow makes staples too, so I always get the same brand.|`|VWMSp0Z9aa	Are you using the correct size staples (sounds like they are too small)and are the staples made for your gun (some staples only work correctly in some brands)? Some guns are very picky. Bring it to the store you purchased it from and ask them to show you exactly what staples work. <br>  <br>  I brought mine to lowes. It was purchased at Sears but lowes did not carry any staples that would work properly in it. Ask an associate- they have an area they can actually test the gun with staples in it (in the staple area). <br>  <br>  I would double check and bring it to a hardware store for a second opinion. You might be able to find a cheap one that gets the job done without any problems.  Good luck!|`|LiqV0tGhaa	The staples are fired out by a narrow blade that just hits the end staple in the staple rack.  I think the firing blade may have got damaged and is hitting 2 or 3 of the end staples, not just the end one.  Perhaps it has got twisted or bent.<br>  <br>  To check this you need to partially dismantle the stapler, perhaps get a guy to show you how this is done (goodbye 10 points).

x9FGHC8Zaa	You should still have it just so that if you decide you feel like cooking something you can. Plus you are right, it would look weird.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	It doesn't matter whether you use your kitchen or not.  It has to be up to speed for anyone for future value of the home.  A well appointed kitchen has to have all the appliances necessary and not the cheapest you can get away with.  If you wish to be a homeowner, be an intelligent one.  These days well appointed kitchens and baths are super important.  Whether you like it or not, they sell the home or not. I would hardily suggest you don't buy a home until you understand  what it means to own one and the factors that are important.  If a stove in a kitchen isn't important what else are you willing to throw away in the home?  You obviously don't understand the basics of home ownership.  Keep renting.|`|Mj5hmRQwaa	If you are looking to purchase a home, I doubt that you will find one without a stove.  If you are building, just leave the opening but not install one if you don't want one.  It is your call.  You need to think about resale.  You are in the minority if you do not choose to have a stove.
mP0LLMVjaa	You cannot just keep painting over the mold. It has to be killed first and then prevented from coming back. <br>  Clean the area with white vinegar. Spray vinegar on the area after it is cleaned and let it dry.

Have him install a ceiling vent fan.|`|FXnHE7mmaa	You cannot kill mold with vinegar. Wipe down the area with bleach..let sit for a few minutes or overnight. Sand down the area in the window sill, then prime it with a good primer, and repaint. Just painting over mold will not stop it..you must kill/remove it first. If this is the only area you are having problems with and you have a working fan exhaust in the bathroom, then the landlord has done all that is expected. Here you either have to have a working window or a fan..you don't need both. You can purchase a dehumidifier to solve your problem.|`|94c2e1a976b337d761ad84ebb0a48658aa	It's your responsibility.  Kill it with bleach.  Wash the area with any household cleaner.  Prime the area with a stain blocking primer, and repaint.<br>  <br>  Keep the door open when not in use.  <br>  <br>  Its caused by the high level of humidity in the room and lack of ventilation|`|sm4wXNOqaa	Mold can be dangerous if you have allergies.  It is easily treated and killed with a bleach water solution.  Just clean the area and spray it with bleach water.  And tell your landlord that you are having a mold problem.  They are ultimately responsible.|`|WzKrZoHQaa	Mould is a fungus and therefore under a microscope it has spores.  Keep copies of everypiece of correspondence to yr landlord - he has a duty of care to his tenants.  The mould can be dealt with but it will be an ongoing issue I'm afraid from within.  Use neat bleach and a old tooth brush or nail brush to kill it off but as said it will return until emtirely dried out - which being a bathroom is just not going to happen, so you are on a cycle I'm afraid.  What about getting some absorbant trays from Hardware store ? These won't solve issue but may buy you time before it returns but it will only be a couple of wks.  landlord must respond within a "reasonable timeframe" but if you have not heard in 2 wks - recontact and keep diary of ALL contact incl telephone calls and general content of conversation as you may need it later.  Good luck
Gzk1TQFAaa	Report it to the building's owner or management.  They probably won't be willing to do anything about it.  Where there's one, there's thousands more!  They could be coming from the walls.  Chances are the whole building is infested.  One thing you could do is to make them retreat.  The over-the-counter chemicals (Raid and the like) will give very temporary relief.  The professional chemicals are much more effective and more expensive.  You can buy them online from www.doyourownpestcontrol.com and other sites.  Google pest control products for more information.  Cleanliness is probably your best defense from roach infestation but that won't stop them.  They can literally live off a bar of soap!  Anything organic is food to them so you'll need to exterminate if you want to get rid of them entirely.|`|07hmAcA1aa	smoosh it.|`|KZ0lKAmTaa	Put out some Borax powder.

IrEudBx3aa	is there anyway to change the walls / carpet / curtain colour? personally i think that a room should be all neutrals or colours that will compliment the room. Try to have a colour theme through out your room. for e.g. my carpet is a dark blue, for my bed i have light blue sheet, white dovet, medium blue pillows, my pin boards are also a different variation of blue.<br>  i also suggest taking down those posters and having pin boards instead, its a much cleaner more effective way to put the things up around your room without it looking tacky.|`|y2nLAYIiaa	I personally love purple , but you should try another color like baby blue or light pink  it seems like it will suit you... and as the person above said try to keep one colour as the theme hope my advice helps :p<br>  <br>  ?,<br>  Chikies

What I would do is look up a list of exotic indoor plants from a-z with images so you can identify what exactly it is. If that doesn't work you can call nursery's or look to to see if you have a master gardeners location in your area usually they have a hotline you can call and ask any questions you have about your plants.
AA11072058	Yes, keep the leaves and other garden debris in your soil.  That is what makes it so healthy.  One of the best amendments you can do to your soil to help it retain moisture is to keep adding compost.  Cotton burr is great.  Start your own compost pile and add grass clippings, leaves and left over fruits, veggies, bread that you don't eat.  Just no oil or meat.  Start an organic fertilizing program.  Check out the Dallas Organic Gardeners Club website at dogc.com.  There is a wealth of info on how to get started.  Are you starting a garden or just trying to get your lawn healthy?  You will find most of your answers there and you can post questions.  If you are starting a flower garden look into native plants.  They are adapted to little rain and the clay soils.  And don't let your age hold you back.  The more you do the stronger you will get.  Just go at it a little at time.  My sister is 64 and she gets out there every spring and works like crazy.|`|5shqstYraa	adding compost should be good and the leaves are good too

brNR9Y6saa	u would have to turn the freezer temperature to be colder.|`|pKGZGe1Gaa	It's called frost. When you open the freezer door the moist air from your kitchen gets into the freezer and condenses on everything. Contributing factors would be the humidity of your house, how stuffed your freezer is and how many times you open the freezer to look longingly at the ice cream.<br>  The most cost effective things you can do to eliminate frost are to keep the freezer right at the freezing point, and if you have a frost free model, make sure that the unit isn't stuffed solid. This enables air to circulate throughout the unit and reduces the frost. You can also try to keep the moisture level in your house low by boiling less water and running a dehumifier, but that's probably overkill for a problem like this.|`|1KNhUPNMaa	liquid gets on them and freezes into nasty ice crystals|`|SSD3jj7baa	they get freezer burt ;) your temp may be set to low|`|be9f617f5a598e41354941dbb40d5e3eaa	It's called freezer burn.

SgGB9Ji7aa	That depends <br>  You have to evaluate what else is on the circuit and then check the “lock rotor amps” located on the face plate {LRA} of the motors or in the spec sheet.<br>  <br>  A normal circuit will allow you 20 amps…. if nothing else is running on it …if your within the range you will have no problem|`|07hmAcA1aa	no or else it will explode, u a$$|`|btVNM1Djaa	my fridge and freezer are plugged into the same recepticle, have been for about 5 years now|`|ispQWeQmaa	I just checked the owner's manual for a monster Amana refrigerator (French doors, 25 cubic feet) and it says it is designed to be used on a dedicated 15 amp line. I think a typical house should be wired for 20 amps at the kitchen fridge receptacle but it should be fairly easy to check that at the circuit breaker.<br>  <br>  The real problem with fridges and freezers is that they use induction motors in the compressor, and the startup wattage on an induction motor is 3-7 times the regular operating wattage. So if you assume your fridge and freezer each draw 300 watts when operating normally, they could each be drawing up to 2100 watts, for a total of 4200 watts if both start up at the same time. At 120 volts, 4200 watts is nearly 35 amps, which could blow the circuit, and if you're not in that could mean a lot of food spoiled.<br>  <br>  I expect you would probably be okay doing this if you have a 20+ amp circuit, as I don't think many fridges or freezers draw anywhere near 2100 watts at startup, but you could always try using something like a Kill A Watt meter to measure startup power use of each device - just unplug it, plug in the Kill A Watt meter, set it to the wattage setting, and then plug in the fridge or freezer to the meter. You'll know within a minute or two how much wattage each appliance draws, and whether it's safe to use both on one circuit. Remember, Watts = Amps x Volts, so just divide the sum of fridge+freezer watts by your voltage (120 in North America) to get the amperage. As long as your circuit is wired to that amperage you should be fine.
SgGB9Ji7aa	Miikeyg is correct, you need a 12 volt source transformer/ballast <br>  If you are hooking up 6 -50 watt bulbs…. you need a 12 volt 300 watt transformer <br>  <br>  <a href="http://expresslighting.com/hatr.html" rel="nofollow">http://expresslighting.com/hatr.html</a>|`|a19b1f4db1d77cea5f81a0935b914989aa	A 12 volt bulb would have to have a 12 volt source.

You could get and adapter like a laptop uses or you could plug it into a cigarette lighter in the car.|`|frUYhmuYaa	NO if it is rated for 75 watt, 250 volt that means that it can take only 3.6watts on 12v(electrical engineering calculations) this means the socket could take a small bulb like 5 watt or smaller. get a better socket or better yet, a set of low voltage track lighting. these usually have built in xfmr's and are much easier to work with. also what is the socket from and are you working with AC or DC?

You can add some stain remover and or laundry soap and scrub with a toohtbrush before you wash as well. You'll be surprised at the stains that white vinegar will remove.I also suggest keeping some all fabric bleach, Vivid or Biz on hand since you work in a restaurant. I think I would just add a little laundry booster of some sort to each wash load.

0a4bd4d0b27788668da04d42dbfa8c22aa	You have to change it . There's a long dip tube on the cold water side as you use hot water , cold water is fed in the cold water side to the bottom of the tank . The way it's hooked up now, the cold water fills to the top . You will not have alot of hot water . If he put unions on the hot and cold lines  you can  disconnect them and pull the dip tube out  and put it in the hot water ( only if you have enough ceiling height ) .The dip tube is usually 6" shorter than the total tank height   . So you may not be able to pull it all the way out .  I would recommend you change the piping .|`|83ef61786e290eb97d6c686cc7478c5caa	Not the best practice but it does depend on the hot water heater and the plumbing system, some units have a back flow preventer which would stop the unit from working being hooked up backwards otherwise it will work the diffrence is at the point where the water enters the tank the hot shoud draw from the top and the cold enter at the botom in other words the cold water tube is longer in the tank and goes almost to the bottom, it will reduce the efficency of the unit and can reduce the amount of hot water that you can use before it begins to cool, its not hard to reverse so it would be the best idea|`|kqE6B7dNaa	i would have someone else correct the problem, he obviously does not know what he is doing. the only problem that you will have with the crossed water lines is that you will have to remember to turn the cold water on in order to have hot water.|`|pFFJN6F5aa	Yes and no|`|fyWGMB9caa	you will get very  little hot water  if installed  improperly
C5UUltHtaa	New condo and there wasn't a doorbell already installed?<br>  Usually the doorbell would be located in a hallway. But if you believe that the open electrical box is for a doorbell then use the wires that are enclosed in the gray jacket you mentioned. That should be wires that come from the button & the transformer, assuming that there is only one doorbell button and not a second button from a backdoor or garage entrance. Since there are 4 wires, you need to determine which 2 to connect to the doorbell. This is where a simple multimeter would come in handy to test the voltage at each wire. (Should be 10 to 12 volts) But maybe you can try different combinations to see which one works. Since the button was installed at construction time, then maybe a transformer was too. 2 of the 4 wires from the gray jacket may be from a transformer. Without a multimeter for testing, then you need to do this: Strip insulation 1/2" from each of the 4 wires. Try touching a pair of wires to the doorbell connection screws. Try different ones until the bell rings. Then note which 2 works. These 2 wires will be from the transformer and the other 2 should be the button. Now take one wire from the transformer and connect it to the doorbell. The other wire from the transformer connect to one of the wires from the button, twist wires together; don't connect to anything else. Then lastly, the other wire from the button will go to the doorbell. But the question is what are the red, white & bare wires for. That may be a 120volt power that comes from a wall switch. It's use I don't know. Or maybe the electrical box in the kitchen has nothing to do with a doorbell at all.<br>  Hard to say without being there myself.<br>  Anyways, hope this gets it for you. Good luck.<br>  <br>  03/09/2009 Yea maybe they never installed a transformer either. Typically it would be install in a basement or crawl space on the outside of an electrical box like this pic:<br>  <br>  (Link) <a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wkdHNv9Uv28/SIZ-FOeV0dI/AAAAAAAAIgU/_HQ93Q1dH3s/IMG_9080.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wkdHNv9Uv28/SIZ-FO...</a><br>  <br>  The 120 wires are connected inside the box and the low voltage wires connect on the outside because the low voltage wires are condsidered safe.<br>  <br>  If you can't locate one and want to install one then most home stores and hardware stores carry this.<br>  <br>  Here is a typical wiring diagram for a doorbell:<br>  <a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wkdHNv9Uv28/SIZ-FOeV0dI/AAAAAAAAIgU/_HQ93Q1dH3s/IMG_9080.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wkdHNv9Uv28/SIZ-FO...</a><br>  Scroll down for the diagram. It shows both one button system and 2 button system.<br>  <br>  Oh and one more thing. If you remove the button that is installed at your door, you can take note of the color of the wires that is connected to the button; that will help you to connect the doorbell.<br>  Also the red & white wires may be for the power for a transformer. Careful though, if it's live it will be 120 volts.<br>  If the box in the kitchen is large enough, the transformer can be wired & mounted inside it. Perhaps the builder intended it to be wired that way.<br>  Hope this helps<br>  Let me know how it went. I have email link in profile.

You can rinse it every so often  to keep odors and bacteria away. In fact if you take the compost makings out every day, anything non porous with a lid to keep the insects away will work.

Mj5hmRQwaa	Red, yellow and orange are stimulating colors but red can also be agitating and best left to accessories for use in a bedroom.  Black is non energizing and neutral - also better left for accessories.  And, I do believe every room needs a touch of black to ground the space. <br>  <br>  Your room needs to be warmed up with warm hues giving you a cozier feeling if you find the blue cold.  Maybe you do not have enough light filtering in.  A gold wall color would sunny it up but...if it were me, I would choose a (neutral) medium "warm" cream, tan, taupe or latte for a sophisticated look which would be nice with black.  And then, bring in your energizing hues in posters/artwork and a splashy rug. You could use red in a comforter, say a burgundy if you wanted to.  You could use black frames on the artwork and use black lamps.    <br>  <br>  I would definitely choose the paint color last and pull from these other items once you have them in place.      <br>  <br>  One last point to mention is that black furniture will show a lot of dust and close in your room more. My professional opinion is that it would be too much. Brown furniture or a light warm pine would be a better choice. Keep it light in scale, nothing bulky for a small room.|`|qQJdi0p1aa	good colors for energy are yellow and sage!! red is a very angry intense color ......|`|aBwQ06A6aa	It's true dark colours make the room feel small, you could go w/ a colour like white, it makes a room feel bigger, or a light tan.

This requires moving furniture as well as smaller items in the room, and you may need a helping hand.

Next, use a microfiber cloth to go over each surface to get more dust off. Move objects off flat surfaces;take your time. A Swifter wand used next will hold minute and hidden dirt. Then, for washable surfaces, clean with a damp cloth moistened with liquid cleaner. You may want to use a product that adds some oil or shine to your distressed furniture.  Clean glass with a Windex-like  cleaner.  Patience and perseverance  will pay off.|`|uheIJLngaa	Gather up the sheets and throw them in the washing machine. <br>  Using the vacuum cleaner, vacuum any and all visible areas, using the attachments to get areas that are up high.<br>  Find several dust cloths and furniture polish and begin dusting. <br>  You might have to dust again, once you've dusted the 1st time, and vacuumed up.

Outside of recessed lights, I would never have an overhead light in any of my rooms and my recessed lights have rheostats.

One overhead light fixture in a room is so 70's and does nothing for the overall comfort feel of a room.  I also no longer do ceiling fans as they are difficult to keep clean but I never have done a ceiling fan with a light for the reasons mentioned above.  No overhead lights in any room unless they are recessed or tracks..

If, however, it only floods the basement while using the washing machine it is one of two things 1. the line between the washer and the building drain is blocked, or 2 you have a gray water system that is clogged up. Either way you will need to call a plumber or rent some drain clearing equipment.|`|83ef61786e290eb97d6c686cc7478c5caa	You have a sewer problem, if every time you use water it comes out the drain pipe for the washing machine if there is constant water inside the washing machine tube and you can see it rise if someone runs the sink in another part of the house, you have a clogged drain, get someone out to snake the drain the problem is common if that house has been vacant for some time solids will dry up in the pipe, and than other matter will get caught on it causing it to eventually clog|`|bbpDgLonaa	Call a plumber or ...you can shut off the water to that pipe, cut out the defective part and replace it with a piece off slightly larger pipe and connect the to ends and the new piece and make sure it's sealed with pipe glue and Teflon tape.|`|DomvY3gdaa	make your self a french drain|`|00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	If you're not sure whether or not you have a septic tank system, then you should call your county health dept., as they would be the permit issuing body and would have a record of any septic tanks buried on your property and where they would be.  It sounds like there's a possibility that the previous owners may have left you a problem, unknowing or not, but you may have to get the septic pumped AND the pipes snaked to get rid of this problem.   There's obviously something clogging the line going either to the street sewer or your septic system and it will need to be removed for water to flow out.   It may be a tree root or a cracked pipe, hard to tell before the repair is actually made.|`|hNfOgNNBaa	The outflow pipe is clogged up and the water is therefore pushing out of your laundry room drain instead of heading off the property.  You need to have a plumber come and snake the drains|`|C5UUltHtaa	If I'm reading your question right... Sounds like it's the washer hose connections at the valves...<br>  Make sure there is a washer at the end of each hose that attaches to your washer.<br>  Turn off each valve then unscrew hose from the valve and look in the end of the hose. There should be a rubber washer there. If there isn't, then it will leak bad no matter how tight you install it. If there is one, then either it's bad and need to be replaced, or the hose connection wasn't tight enough. Check both hot and cold water hose connections.<br>  Hope this helps|`|fyWGMB9caa	the pipe in between the hoses is where the washing machine discharges . if water is coming  out of the standpipe than your drain line is clogged going out to the septic  . that  pipe is the lowest  point in your drain system so every time you use water it will come out the pipe , you need to remove the blockage .|`|OEATSehSaa	maybe thre is a leak with the washing machines pipe|`|yjvv5bDjaa	are you sure it's not from outside?<br>  <br>  if it is...check your drain pipes
