Sorry to disillusion you, but there isn't a writer on here that doesn't have ideas for far more original stories than they could ever write. You'll have to do your own writing.|`|38eb78ef54653766c3ca71d79051901caa	Sorry, I don't understand your question.    First of all, no one publishes story ideas.    Second, if you publish your stories to a community, why would a publisher pick you up?  You've already put it out there for free, there's no money to be made.    Here's a website that might help you:    http://www.writersdigest.com/GeneralMenu...|`|2hQFdy08aa	You have to show them that your story ideas are worth squat by writing the entire book, first.  Once you spend a decade or two getting a good name for yourself, then maybe you can get a contract before finishing a novel.    Ideas are free.  Good writing ain't.|`|YorMkZYAaa	Is this a case of another unknown writer who think he is the sh*t and everyone should bow at his supposed greatness?    It is? *yawn*    Moving on...|`|LVZdzPmpaa	You do not publish story ideas.    There is no community that is interested in "helping" you publish. You're on your own in that regard.     Before you think about publishing, you must first turn your time and energy to writing, editing, revising and crafting a salable story. Until then, any consideration about publishing is a total waste of time.|`|idfDPhiWaa	NO mainline publisher is going to bother with a complete unknown.  In this day and age, you either get a LITERARY AGENT to sell your stories.. or YOU DON'T PUBLISH.|`|QZ2T1uJoaa	Maybe a web site or some place but becareful on those they could steal your idea! Ask a librearian too!|`|fkwYvFBRaa	I totally understand where you are coming from. There are lots of writers out there that are not getting the kind of recognition they deserve because number one, they do not know where to turn to to get their stories across and number two, not everybody has the same level of thinking that they have - which of course results to them turning the book down.     Writers like you have every potential to get started on a publishing career. If you are looking for self-publishing companies to publish your book, I know of a few companies that practically holds court to everything a book needs from getting you your copyright, size preferences, book cover design customization, layout consultation, copyediting and even marketing  at affordable costs.     Publishing companies now have all the resources to publish books with the same productivity and efficacy as that of regular black and white books. Considering the fact that most books are in full color, you should choose a publishing company whose books are of the highest quality, bar none.    It's fun that you get to see your book published with the same expertise and professionalism as the regular books that you see in bookstores.     Self-publishing entirely means that you get to retain full control of your books production and that it gives you the option to publish your work and claim authority of the photos that you have chosen to be published.    Now, perhaps this free information guide will help you get started or just click on the links below.     I hope I have helped.

4F8b4D6Laa	Unlike the previous answerers I believe she is a Mary Sue, because:    - she's portrayed as super smart even though she acts TSTL,    - everyone lusts after her,    - she appears in book 5 after 3 books without being mentioned only to be the most popular awesome girl at school.|`|Rc4Chlw3aa	She's not, not really.    I mean, she's kind of annoying, but her character still has much more depth than Bella in Twilight...|`|810513944bc1fc28c514a617993b162faa	She isn't.    "Perhaps the single underlying feature of all characters described as "Mary Sues" is that they are too ostentatious for the audience's taste, or that the author seems to favor the character too highly. The author may seem to push how exceptional and wonderful the "Mary Sue" character is on his or her audience, sometimes leading the audience to dislike or even resent the character fairly quickly; such a character could be described as an "author's pet"    If she was a Mary Sue she and Harry would have had an epic love story spanning books and books from the very beginning... As it was, she was nearly Voldy-food, and got the guy when he was about to die...|`|kdxxuQwNaa	She;s not. Bella is though.

Far too many aren't!|`|8QjEISWeaa	not at all, that fact that you may take a long time writting a book like that doesn't mean there are smart people who can write a book faster than what you ever think. and if still that was not the case, you can write little by little in a long term of time, so at the end you will end up with a book..|`|1Otoe7S8aa	YES!!!!
R5UIMBvcaa	I've read, seen (at least four different performances), and taught Othello quite a few times, and the only passage I can think of that approaches wit is the scene between Iago and Emilia, beginning, "I have a thing for you."  Well, maybe the conversation between Desdemona (serious and high-minded) and Emilia (down to earth and earthy) as Desdemona prepares for bed the last time.  Oh, yes, there are plenty of innuendos and double entendres, but most of them are too cynical to be very witty.|`|AnC1CgRaaa	Check this out:   http://books.google.com/books?id=jcFRMJx...

OCdUI3wzaa	Wuthering Heights opens with Lockwood, a tenant of Heathcliff's, visiting the home of his landlord. A subsequent visit to Wuthering Heights yields an accident and a curious supernatural encounter, which pique Lockwood's curiosity. Back at Thrushcross Grange and recuperating from his illness, Lockwood begs Nelly Dean, a servant who grew up in Wuthering Heights and now cares for Thrushcross Grange, to tell him of the history of Heathcliff. Nelly narrates the main plot line of Wuthering Heights.  Mr. Earnshaw, a Yorkshire Farmer and owner of Wuthering Heights, brings home an orphan from Liverpool. The boy is named Heathcliff and is raised with the Earnshaw children, Hindley and Catherine. Catherine loves Heathcliff but Hindley hates him because Heathcliff has replaced Hindley in Mr. Earnshaw's affection. After Mr. Earnshaw's death, Hindley does what he can to destroy Heathcliff, but Catherine and Heathcliff grow up playing wildly on the moors, oblivious of anything or anyone else  until they encounter the Lintons.  Edgar and Isabella Linton live at Thrushcross Grange and are the complete opposites of Heathcliff and Catherine. The Lintons welcome Catherine into their home but shun Heathcliff. Treated as an outsider once again, Heathcliff begins to think about revenge. Catherine, at first, splits her time between Heathcliff and Edgar, but soon she spends more time with Edgar, which makes Heathcliff jealous. When Heathcliff overhears Catherine tell Nelly that she can never marry him (Heathcliff), he leaves Wuthering Heights and is gone for three years.  While he is gone, Catherine continues to court and ends up marrying Edgar. Their happiness is short-lived because they are from two different worlds, and their relationship is strained further when Heathcliff returns. Relationships are complicated even more as Heathcliff winds up living with his enemy, Hindley (and Hindley's son, Hareton), at Wuthering Heights and marries Isabella, Edgar's sister. Soon after Heathcliff's marriage, Catherine gives birth to Edgar's daughter, Cathy, and dies.  Heathcliff vows revenge and does not care who he hurts while executing it. He desires to gain control of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange and to destroy everything Edgar Linton holds dear. In order to exact his revenge, Heathcliff must wait 17 years. Finally, he forces Cathy to marry his son, Linton. By this time he has control of the Heights and with Edgar's death, he has control of the Grange.  Through all of this, though, the ghost of Catherine haunts Heathcliff. What he truly desires more than anything else is to be reunited with his soul mate. At the end of the novel, Heathcliff and Catherine are united in death, and Hareton and Cathy are going to be united in marriage.|`|DvToP5h7aa	Wuthering Heights - Emily Bronte    Features: Chapter-By-Chapter Summary and Commentary, Plot Summary, Character Descriptions, Literary Analysis  Themes.    http://www.bookrags.com/notes/wh/    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/wuthering/    http://summarycentral.tripod.com/wutheri...    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...    http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/Bront...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...    http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/t...    ?

ElTNcN2Uaa	Yes. Even BEFORE it was turned into a movie. And the weird thing is, even as I was reading it, I actually PICTURED Tom Cruise as Mitch McDeere.    It was slightly different but a great book, nonetheless.|`|8j70Neqeaa	its firm alright
70266aa4d3e1b7d987168b83ae1804aaaa	It's OK. I see the idea.  Alyssa and Connor get more of a background following their synopsis, I assume, before you place them in the story.  If not, I would suggest you use your current synopsis for, say Alyssa, then start a whole new paragraph giving her padding (life,if you will), of how she arrives in the story and her relationship to it.  Then before you bring Connor in, cut back to his synopsis; and do the same, so that the reader identifies with them and wants to follow them threw the story - as I assume they are to be your main characters, but their descriptive poise is not large enough we need background.  But, all in all, the ideas there, just keep working on it.  Although a brief synopsis of the story may help people comment.|`|ElTNcN2Uaa	It's too long. Everything you SAID could be condensed into one paragraph.     E.G. I was going to the party in SPITE of my parents forbidding it.     Don't make it  too wordy, too long. Your words have to PULL the reader into the next sentence. The reader CAN'T have the feeling of having to PUSH his or her way into the story.     You should actually take classes in creative writing.|`|zYZIw0Mqaa	The blurb doesn't really outline your story, it's more of a frenzy of ideas. I suggest changing the second paragraph to outline the main plot.     The prologue was good, atleast a lot better than the other dribble we read on this =)    I like your style of writing, but as the above person said, practise makes perfect.

EHrbDq0naa	You did fine on your essay!     I saw only two errors and both are because you used apostrophes inappropriately.    In the next to the last paragraph, you wrote:  12th birthday    Take away the punctuation entirely; it's not necessary.  However, if you feel it's needed, then use quotation marks, not apostrophes. I prefer it without.    Three sentences after that you wrote how in the dark'  If the phrase "how in the dark" is quoted from the play, use quotation marks as I did.  Otherwise, it appears you are using that phrase because you couldn't think of a better way to put it and by accentuating it with punctuation, you are drawing attention to it. If that is the case, either reword it or keep in but drop the apostrophes.    Good job!|`|YorMkZYAaa	Your answer is to put it away for awhile and then look for errors. In the meantime, read "Elements of Style" by Strunk and White to learn more on the mechanical side of writing. There is no excuse for you not taking the time to learn and then expecting others to correct your work.
VzvW8Y1paa	Short Answer-- yes.     Long Answer-- all guitars feel a little different to play, but the fingerings should be basically the same.|`|b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Yes.  Although electric guitars in general are easier to play due to lighter strings and the ability to bend them easily and the distance from the string to the fret...  Fingering is the same though on an acoustic,   but you can't rely on your amp and effects to hide your mistakes....|`|ElTNcN2Uaa	chords are chords
LVZdzPmpaa	The "flow" has to do with the writer's ability to tell a story. There are a number of ways to tell a story; there is no "right" way. But the story, as you know, has to allow the reader to follow along without difficulty.    Story telling is a skill that's honed by practice. Reading is also crucial to learning to be a good storyteller. You must first understand how stories are crafted, what makes one more enjoyable than another, and what are the factors that determine this for the reader?     Reading is half of writing. In order to write, you must read until your eyes bleed. If you want to write fiction, you must read a lot of fiction. If you want to write thrillers, read thrillers. If you want to try your hand at literary fiction, read that? Romance? Read that.    There is no great secret formula or special tactic. It's good to start off with at least a little bit of natural talent, but practice is the only way to perfect great storytelling skill.|`|38eb78ef54653766c3ca71d79051901caa	Not particularly.      Sorry, couldn't resist.    I echo Patti's comments.      One thing I do notice in a lot of the stories that are posted here is the "making sense only to the author" syndrome.  Be very careful of that.    Nothing turns me off more than trying to figure out what in the world a paragraph means.    You need to write stories with the reader in mind.|`|M9xINK68aa	I don't think there's an answer to this question.    Why don't you pick up some books on creative writing and take some classes. Nobody can just describe a way to write that helps it flow. You just... write... well.|`|iFORmz1Waa	don't use long words just to impress (unless it's a school assignment or something)  don't use long sentences  basically short and snappy = short and sweet  also take out any unneccesary words, usually things like 'that' and 'as'  if the sentence makes sense without them take them out    use proper grammar or you'll stop the flow  :]
wdYNUJ0Iaa	Here are some great series:    Cirque du Freak, by Darren Shan    Harry Potter, by J.K. Rowling    Twilight, by Stephanie Meyer    The Alex Rider Collection, by Anthony Horowitz    Crank, by Ellen Hopkins (other books in collection include Burned, Glass, and Impulse)        Other great reads:    You Don't Know Me, by David Klass    Shattering Glass, by Gail Giles    Jude, by Kate Morgenroth    The Burn Journals, by Brent Runyon    Invisible, by Pete Hautman|`|R0iHHPqEaa	try cherub|`|QlB3VXWraa	Read the trilogy that begins with "The Butlerian Jihad" by Brian Herbert. It's a prequel to "Dune" and it's even better.|`|AA11165686	Try reading the Uglies series. It's about a society where everyone gets surgery at the age of 16 to become "pretty". The series is by Scott Westerfeld, and the books are Uglies, Pretties, Specials, and Extras. The first three follow the story of Tally Youngblood, and the last one branches off a bit and though Tally is in it, she's not the main character anymore.    You might also like the Bartimaeus Trilogy. It's about an alternate reality of London that is ruled by wizards. The wizards, however, don't have any magic themselves. Instead, they command these demons to do their magic. It's a great trilogy.

He does this by forming a skin-tight barrier around his opponent. The barrier doesn't actually nullify his enemy's powers but, contains them within its field. This in turn causes damage to his opponent by essentially using his/her powers against him/her self.    He also has a secondary power. While his opponent's powers are contained within the barrier, he is able to "siphon" a great portion of the power the opponent has cast. Once absorbed, he is then able to use it (one time only) against his opponent(s).|`|XDNer3Huaa	How about controlling fire and running really fast..|`|mTCjBqHgaa	Well, from his physical description, it seems like he would have a dark personality. I think that astral projection could be a good power, so don't think it's stupid. But I think that you could strech that power out a little bit, since it's your story. Why not have him be able to leave his physical body and appear in dreams? It's your story, so just use you imagination. Story sounds interesting, by the way.|`|LuqtCMCoaa	Definitely sounds like twilight. :P|`|SygvUa0Eaa	This sounds a little familiar to me... Twilight?    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_com...

74edcf791dc4861c0fa85ec65b26f4e3aa	If you go to amazon.com and read the reviews, you'll get a very good idea of the entire book.  It's still under copyright and should not be available online unless through an agreement with the publisher.  alternately, check to see if your local library grants access to books online through netlibrary or other source, and see if Alexander is one of the offerings.

LVZdzPmpaa	I am not aware of a single book devoted to John Lee Love.    Go to http://www.amazon.com    Choose "books" from the drop-down menu and then enter "black inventors."     You'll get a list of related titles. Check out each one and see if any of them contain info on John Love.|`|5478d54ea53fcef0ef93502a7e237c89aa	It's unlikely that you're going to find a whole book on him, if the only thing he's known for is inventing one tool.    Here is a list of books that include biographies of a number of African American inventors.  The only way to find out if John Lee Love is included is to get one of them from the library, or check the description of the book on Amazon.com and see if his name is mentioned.    http://www.librarything.com/search_works...
fhPIdqQqaa	I don't think so. There's usually a statement at the front of a book saying something like, "All references to people, places, things are fictional." In the book Because of Winn-Dixie the dog is named after a real grocery store. I don't think that should keep you from using the name, especially if the company isn't too well-known.|`|9Duha1k4aa	If its some minor company, i don't see why not. Just don't end up naming it Microsoft or Sony.|`|6HOcthxaaa	i dont think there is a problem with that..it isnt plagerism or anything its just a name. whats the name im curious?|`|U2wkJRrMaa	If your book gets published you could be sued for copyright infringement. But if this is just something you're writing for fun, then you can call him whatever so pleases you.    I would just change it if you had any intentions of trying to publish.
U2wkJRrMaa	I don't know any others who write mainly in verse like her, but Chuck Palahniuk is pretty good.    I'd suggest you read 'My Happy Life' by Lydia Millet if you liked 'Impulse'.    Also, 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' by Ken Kesey is a great classic novel that I loved very much. I think you might like it too, even if you've seen the movie the book is fantastic.|`|LfGQjuZnaa	I would say Sarah Dessen and Megan Mccafferty.

I would recommend a book called "The Wasp Factory" by Scottish writer Iain Banks. It will be like nothing you have read before. If it does not make your jaw drop (you will know the scene when you read it) then you are in fact, dead.   I'm ancient and still read kids books if the word is they are good. "Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key" is the best book about being a messed up kid I have ever read. It is utterly heartbreaking and at the same time so funny. Unique in all my story loving years.  I have a thousand desert island books, and these two are at the top of the list.|`|4F8b4D6Laa	Maybe you'll like The Host, it's also by SM.|`|0zr5YEJ6aa	ERAGON  ELDEST  BRISINGR  PRIDE AND PREJUIDCE  EMMA  OHHHH WAIT tHE PERCY JACKSON OLYMPIAN SERIES|`|fhPIdqQqaa	The Book Thief by Markus Zusak (I don't know if I spelled his name correctly, probably not but its close) is possibly one of the best books I have ever read. It takes a few chapters to get into, but don't let that discourage you from reading it!    I also thought Tell It To Naomi (can't remember the author) was pretty funny if you like humorous books (who doesn't?)    A few more:  13 Reasons Why  Maximum Ride series  and Tamar (also hard to get into, but best surpise ending ever)    Happy Reading  : )
hJP9y6kjaa	Maple necks have a clear lacquer finish, as far as I understand.    The link below has some discussion about neck finishing, hope it helps.    For conditioning, I use almond oil, which is the same oil that is used by many professional luthiers. I have also used olive oil to great results. While some use lemon oil, mineral oil, and other such substances, I prefer not to since they contain solvents and petroleum distillates. I clean my neck with water, a clean cotton t-shirt, and a diluted soap solution.    You probably don't need this with a clear-coated maple neck, unless the finish has worn off. If this is the case, I'd go by what they say in the link below.      Saul|`|Ow3O7h4caa	Hi    The maple fretboard is coated with a lacquer finish and get used over time.

I want to start going again, but im worried that everyone will be so much better than me.    But, i would suggest u going for it because your obviously fit as you play soccer. I wish I had started but no one would go with me to the dance classes.    Definitly go for it. :)     Good luck.|`|826IxsmMaa	Of course not. For ballet.. I believe it's better if you start younger so it's not so hard to adjust your posture etc. But who cares! The age you start won't matter at all|`|nglcDsd0aa	I say your never to old to learn something new! =)  Start whenever you want!  My sister started dancing at age 20!
DjCLWseZaa	As was I, as was I. I finally asked a team Jake member. She said that it is because they preffered the Jacob character to the hot but creepy Edward, and they hoped that maybe, just maybe, Meyer would have Bella's love for him (established in New Moon) grow. I agree that it doesn't fit in the story, but neither did the non-existent romance between hermione and harry that so many Harry Potter fans held onto.|`|3Nr9o9UDaa	i am not a team jacob gal personally i prefer edward.  team jacob was created by fans for fans who wish that bella had ended up with jacob.|`|6HOcthxaaa	well i dont know if you read all the books...but mostly in new moon bella considers being with jacob after edward leaves and she is confused about it for a while even when edward returns. so yea i guess thats why...plus its kind of a do you like werewolves or vampires kind of this.            personally im team edward((:|`|bj5Hq83uaa	well i am team edward but team jacob is only there because taylor lautner is HAWT!!! soooo idk|`|FNwYzjogaa	Well Bella lead him on for a long enough time that he fell in love with her. Jacob treated her well and he would have been a good boyfriend to her.|`|Pq8gQsl2aa	There's a Team Jacob because Bella has loved Jacob too. Only she stops loving him after the first couple of books. (?) If you read New Moon it should make more sense. She makes out with Jacob and tells him she loves him, etc. But she loves Edward more. Plus Jacob is a werewolf so it comes back to the whole vampires v.s. werewolves thing.    Hoped I helped!|`|zqxP5exvaa	Well team Jocob people like myself like Jacob better than edward, or think that bella should of chosen jacob!!.....jaob is funny tall dark and handsome (lol)   I understand why a guy wouldnt really choose sides because that would be kinda creepy    lol|`|fI4LqMVMaa	whats so confusing about it?  Wherever there are people who like the sunshine there will be those who enjoy the rain.  There are many people who feel edward exemplifies undesirable characteristics for a significant other:  Jelously and overprotectiveness, irrationality, fear of commitment, stalkerish tendencies, etc.  To those people, Jacob represents a wonderful alternative, and a viable candidate for Bella's affections.|`|ngHD8K8eaa	i am team edward but alot of people i know like Jacob more then Edward because of his personality, they thought that after new moon there was a chance with Jacob, Taylor L. The actor that portrays Jacob is really cute to some girls. Peronally i think Rob Pattinson is way cuter but you could see where the teams come in lol.|`|cpepmfD9aa	There really shouldn't be any teams, but some people think Bella should have been with Jacob. And Jacob does love her. But after  Breaking Dawn it really should have been put to rest.

ahjqc9Ifaa	The rights to another person's life story don't belong to you. If they were a public figure, then you can write about their public life as documented by TV, newspapers, etc.    But if you write about their private life and your work contains anything negative (which it's bound to), you may be open to civil suit.    Either consult a lawyer with a detailed synopsis of what you plan to portray in your script, or fictionalize the real person's life and change enough details that it's not clearly about that person.|`|JlEucUVtaa	Ask a lawyer.
6HOcthxaaa	well when edward says the adoption stuff charlie catches on quickly once he sees renesme's face and see's edward and bella's features. he gets mad about the lies but lets it go. and no charlie doesnt know about vampirism charlie wants to keep it on a need to know basis. and later in the book bella's plans for jacob to tell him about it if she dies, which obviously means he doesnt know yet.|`|3Nr9o9UDaa	no they didnt tell him everything or anything specifically but im pretty sure he at least suspects that nessie is edward and bellas kid.  but no they didnt tell him, maybe someday they would have if the series had continued.|`|dZfrr4rPaa	Yes they did try to pretend that shes adopted but the resemblance tells him shes Bella's but Charlie decides not to ask questions because he doesn't want to hear the answers! He's content just being apart of his daughter and granddaughters lives! They do not tell him that Bella's a vampire, he just knows somethings different but he;s fine with not knowing details|`|c8Nah2iCaa	No, they let charlie come up with his own conclusion 'need to know'|`|ngHD8K8eaa	nope. when he saw jacob phase he really did not want to find out a whole lot more about that kinda stuff. When he looked at Their baby he attempted to figure how they could have done this, in just a months time. He said he would like "as little bit of information as possible." so to answer your question no he did not find out about the "Vampires  bella did not want him to find out either. for his own safety with the Voltiur  :-) hope this helps|`|nOKBoX7Kaa	They don't tell him about the vampire stuff.  Basically they just tell him that he won't want to know the truth so he shouldn't question it. . Kinda.|`|zqxP5exvaa	Well...when jacob phased in front of Charlie, he freaked out and wanted only a 'need to know basis' So Charlie kinda realized when he say Renesmees brown eyes he kinda realized that she was bella's....and then jacob kinda told him that it wasnt a 'need to know' so he didnt really care after that...he was all like "pretty baby" and stuff like that|`|VuGMOf4Caa	Yeah i didn't get this either   Another example of something left unexplained - **** writing
exxHakadaa	The best thing you can do is try to sing lower notes. My choir teacher used to tell us that it helped us learn to sing lower and it made our upper range sound better and clear. It also made us sing higher.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	other than the obvious answer of taking voice training lessons....    find some songs in which the singer uses various ranges. sing along and take notes on the parts that you have trouble on. focus on those parts until you can sing them better. also as i've suggested on here before, if you have a piano or keyboard play each note up and down and sing along with all the notes. also maybe check out some online tutorials on vocal training and breathing exercises.

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Get in touch with your feelings and write what you feel.  Don't worry if you think it's not good enough or something.  It might not seem good to you,  but might be great to someone else.  Besides, you'll always be changing it if you sing it live.  I don't think I've played a song the same way twice in 30 years!
C6SDwznCaa	its too confusing.. too many characters and pretty predictable.
b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	I've been playing for about 30yrs.  Both professionally and (now-a-days) just for myself.  1) Acoustic guitar uses steel strings.  Classical, or Spanish guitars use nylon strings.  Each has its own sound.  I used to have a beat-up old classical that I'd take to the beach and parties and such that had the most amazing sound.  I'd keep it in the trunk of my car, if I ever felt the need to jam.  I miss that old guitar...  2) Well, $400 isn't going to get you a Martin, but it's plenty to get a good-sounding, solid acoustic. Spend a lot of time at Guitar Center and other outlets and PLAY PLAY PLAY...  Try out every single guitar you can in your price range.  Find out which one you feel the most comfortable with,  and which one sounds the best to you.  Stay away from laminates.  Also, keep an eye out for used guitars.  You might get lucky and find a vintage guitar for cheap..  3) The species of wood and its availability is a huge factor in pricing.  Some woods aren't even available anymore.  And they are treasured by luthiers for the quality of their sound reproduction.  Guitars built with some of these woods can run (believe it or not) $100,000 and up!!  And all the frills (inlays, gold plating...) add onto the bill.  Right now, stick to functionality, not frills.  4) Hand made guitars are, in my humble opinion, the Rolls Royces of guitars. Much more care is given, as opposed to ones that come off an assembly line.  (man..my fingers are getting tired..)  5) Again, the brand I chose to play might not be the one for you.  Play play play.  6) I took lessons very soon after I started playing and I wouldn't have it any other way. You learn so much more with someone helping you than you do on your own. BUT, make sure you find a GOOD teacher! That's very important. Also, lessons aren't cheap so make your lessons count. Practice your lessons. Don't show up unprepared cuz you're just throwing your money away and annoying the teacher. Once you feel that you've learned as much as you can from your teacher, you can find a better one (for more money of course) or continue your studies on your own and develop your own style.    I gotta go soak my fingers in ice-water now....  Too much typing!!!
ztrq4W7Naa	The epiphine dot is a pretty good guitar for its price. But i suggest wait a little bit so you could get the casino. I was about to get the dot but the sound did not please me that much. I bought the epiphone sheraton. Also if you are really into the beatles try a rickenbacker.|`|pj4agFiOaa	dots are great but arent that high on the looks chart  look at a rickenbacher if the price isnt too high  epiphone firebirds are great too but are more bluesey|`|mGKQY6OPaa	get like...  wait..ur trying to get a electric guitar or acoustic?  if electric get..- Stratocaster  if acoustic get..- Dean Performer E Acoustic    both cool guitars..i like the stratocaster :D

SygvUa0Eaa	Honestly, it reveals too little. I would keep reading, but just to find out what's going on.|`|yndz0QbUaa	I don't think it reveals too much... it's actually a little ambiguous.  I could do with a bit more info.  But it's intriguing!|`|bj5Hq83uaa	personally. i wouldnt read on sorry!!! its very confusing and a bit like twilight.|`|eo0DKI0qaa	Quite poetic, email me the next set if you write on.    rocknrolltrekkie@yahoo.com|`|sX6ZM0jVaa	It's good but I feel like I read the exact same thing in twilight.|`|KBpw3xGDaa	That is very good!  I would read on.  What did you mean by did it reveal too much?  Yes, you should add.  No, you should not change.  I really did enjoy it. It's very poetry-like.|`|DVXoWIYgaa	I think it's good.... i think you should keep writing.
38eb78ef54653766c3ca71d79051901caa	You need to know where one sentence ends and another one begins.    Paragraphs.  One idea, one paragraph.    The same goes for dialogue.  One speaker, one paragraph, even if it only one word.  The attributions should not be a separate sentence.  They are the continuation of the dialogue.    You rolled off your bed onto the ground?  I think it should be floor.    You have incomplete sentences, spelling errors, grammar problems.    You also need to learn the difference between THEIR, THERE and THEY'RE, YOUR and YOU'RE, TOO and TO.  You are using them all in the wrong context.    The most important thing is that this story is full of plot holes and does not make sense.    Sorry to be harsh.|`|DjCLWseZaa	I love it!!!  Your writing flows well. You might want to shape up your grammar.  I like the end.  Christian|`|u8FZ128Xaa	i like your story so far i think that it is really good!|`|NkjuLwbxaa	I really like it! I thought that it was very good! But yes, at a few parts the grammar was off.|`|h3A5WBPyaa	A lot of it had forgotten punctuation. Other than that, really great story!|`|dTh4cnBVaa	Here is what I like: the imaginative beginning that draws the reader into the story leaving the reader wanting to read more and know what comes next.  It is what we call the "hook" to get the reader interested.   Here is what I do not like:  the awkward sentence structure, grammatical mistakes and incorrect or weak use of some adjectives.  This really needs work so that it flows in a more literary manner.  It needs tightening up.   All the characters are interesting, but need developing before I would commit to a favorite.  The secret to becoming a good writer is to keep writing and to write lots and lots.  Brush up on your language skills and your writing mechanics.   Edit and re-write.   Never underestimate the value of an extensive vocabulary!    Be sure to send us your next chapter...I want to know where Charlotte will end up.|`|VflqP1KQaa	very good ending,

Check out this site|`|47c479f2304b0788f9cb6367693718d5aa	I dont know where you live, but I would suggest you call a local piano technician.  He probably has a copy of Pierce Piano Atlas, and can give you the age of the piano ( for that matter your local library might have it) and tell you the condition ( Pianos usually last about 60 to 80 years before needing reconditioning) and tell you what it needs in the way of tuning and repair.  Vose and sons has been out of business for a long time and I would say your piano is at least 80 years old, and with such a low number I would say it was built before 1912 but that is a guess.  So it will be needing some work.  On the other hand Vose and sons is a highly respected piano and well worth the cost of repair.

Ow3O7h4caa	Hi    I suggest to invest in a good amp or a good guitar. Right now, you are upgrading and willing to spend $500. In the end, your guitar and your amp will have ended costing you $1500 to 2000.00.    Why not invest in a good guitar or a good amp. That way, on your next purchase, you will just need to invest in a good guitar or a good amp but not both. Get it ?    Get a Jackson Dinky. These guitars rock. They have 24-fret which allow soloing on the high resgisters. The necks are smooth and one of the fastest neck on the market. Plus, it has active electronics and EMG pickups. The guitar comes close to a fender sound on some settings.    Your choice......:-)    Here is the link....    http://www.musiciansfriend.com/navigatio...|`|3xJqb2HMaa	look at some Jackson, Yamaha , Ibanez, Epiphone , maybe a yamaha pacifica, Epiphone LP100 or G310, or jackson js20

exxHakadaa	Start by singing scales. Hold out the notes. Do a couple of the major ones, like E flat and G. Then use those same scales and sing solfege. Then you need to sing mama made me mash my m and m's in fifths. Go up as high as you can go then go as low as you can. Then all you need to sing loud and with a lot of air.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	other than the obvious answer of taking voice training lessons....    find some songs in which the singer uses various ranges. sing along and take notes on the parts that you have trouble on. focus on those parts until you can sing them better. also as i've suggested on here before, if you have a piano or keyboard play each note up and down and sing along with all the notes. also maybe check out some online tutorials on vocal training and breathing exercises.

Very strongly.|`|Tp4R14rlaa	I DO........ NOT!!!!!!!!|`|xCgGDcdIaa	I think it's pretty good, but I dont obsess over it.|`|XWdc2qk4aa	people who havn't read many books.|`|i4SVk2Cpaa	definitely dont think it is the 'best ever' but the first book was a good read and the third but personally i hated the second and last book in the series|`|z20d4fI1aa	Read it more than once and you'll see how badly she writes....

WATCH !|`|oboe5c4Waa	So this is my opinion of the Harry Potter and Twilight war that is going on in the world.    NOTE: I have read all the HP books and Twilight books    First: The thing that makes me SOOOOOOOOO mad is that twilighters MUST compare Twilight to HP, where there is honestly no comparison. Stephanie Meyer is good, but J.K. Rowling is way out of her league. The subtle tones and underlying attitudes in HP are much better than in twilight. I read all of these books (HP and Twilght) and Twilight was barely marginal. J.K. was MUCH better. J.K. had a way with words that you can only be born with. Stephanie Meyer sounds like she was trained in it.     NEXT: J.K.'s passion for the Harry Potter books is unprecidented in any other books in the world. While you read Harry Potter, you can feel her emotions flowing through the words and into you. I find my self laughing and yelling at those books all the time. I didnt laugh once in Twilight. All i thought about was "holy crap, now that i started i have to finish. wtf have i got myself into. i hate this!"     THIRD: Harry Potter is just so much more like todays society! I dont mean the magic part of HP, but the emotions in HP. All of HP's emotions are emotions that i myself would feel if i was in that situation. No stupid romantic feelings, no annoying cliches about relationships, and no over exagerated personalities.    FOURTH: Who, honestly had ever heard of twilight before that one commercial about the movie. I can name like 10 people. thats it. I know you did NICOLE!    LAST: The last reason is because of the popularity thing. People say twilight is more popular and has sold more book thn HP. I know people think it has but HP had SEVEN books. Each has sold more than any book EVER! Add that all up, and it grosses more than the population of people in the world. Actually probably not but i garuntee it comes closer than any book ever has. Also HP had all night parties at Borders, twilight did not. HP has millions more male fans that enjoy that book than those that enjoy twilight. Stephanie Meyer created a book that only women, and overly sensitive men can enjoy. Plus, the only reason people know about twilight is because of the movie. Twilight has been out since 2005. It is 2009 and people are just now freaking out over it. HP was popular WAY before the movies ever came out. The only reason half the people in the world read twilight is because of Robert Pattinsen playing edward.    You wanted the truth and here it is. it may be annoying to hear, but it is true all the same    This is my opinion on this subject. I dont care what others think, this is my opinion.      Oh and this a statistic from forbes.com. J.K. Rowling grossed 300,000,000$ this year and HP 7 sold more than 20,000,000 copies in the first 24 hours! SO SUCK ON THAT STEPHANIE MEYER|`|tOd9OuNiaa	i think that there are too many books in the world to choose just one. and besides that, i think it would make more sense if you read every single book that exists, then decide which book is the best. even then, it would be very difficult, but in the end, twilight would be at the bottom of the list.|`|VtFIlYWJaa	um only complete idiots|`|6nJKfktTaa	Yes it is very good, the perfect book in the world!!!

Guilty of a sucker for good romance|`|b27mXVzSaa	No. There are many writers out there who have created more poetic, better written and more imaginative works than anything that could come out of Stephanie Meyer's mind.|`|A5litJrraa	woohooo!! LOVE twilight and other twihards :D:D:D|`|EQm2iCpaaa	I couldnt agree more I live for that book it is my bible.|`|9HCypvHJaa	I love it, but it's not the best book ever.

It may be entertaining, but it's certainly no Crime and Punishment or 1984 or Two Cities.|`|vrcxxRr8aa	No... I can think of many books that are better. Memoirs of a Geisha, Interview With a Vampire, Bard: Odyssey of the Irish, Soprano Sorceress, 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Ill-Made Mute, Jurassic Park, Prey, Sword of the Land, Sabriel, His Dark Materials, Shattered Mirror...

M7W7lZBBaa	a GOOD poem has no set value, a GOOD poem does not need to follow a certain scheme, a GREAT poem travels from your heart to the page.    Their are no rules in poetry, they are simply feelings let loose in a format of your choosing. Anyone who nitpicks poetry only offers their views not their heart so it cannot truly be judged by another without first knowing what was in the heart of the writer.|`|bjrN737daa	A person "who has never attempted poetry" can and should provide feedback on whether the poem is likeable or readable and in fact understood. Crit of technique/style is not necessary unless you know something about format and meter, rhyme and poetic devices. If you enjoy a poem just say so. Say what you think it means. You could be doing the poet a favour in picking the meaning or giving it an alternative meaning the poet hadn't thought of. Negative response will be accepted if given with the reason why. If the comment is "it sucks" stands alone, without reason for the comment, then it holds no usefulness at all and will be disregarded.

IIa4efh5aa	"But if I really say it  the radio won't play it  unless I lay it  between the lines"  -- The Mamas and the Papas    Some truths about the human condition are so difficult to discuss that writing about them in a straight narrative would be the literary equivalent of getting up on a soapbox and screaming at people. Rather than taking an accusatory tone that would demand that people examine their own shortcomings, it is easier to an author to make the same point in a story  containing talking animals or gnomes.    I suspect that C.S. Lewis' Narnia trilogy would have been neither as popular or effective had it been more overtly Christian than it was. By couching it in allegory, he was able to engage readers who otherwise would have bolted for the exits rather than be caught dead with a religious tome.|`|SygvUa0Eaa	It's just a style they choose to use for interpretation.|`|Au1VVDG0aa	because earthly experiences can't describe what happens in hell, purgatory, and heaven

The only reason I caught that was because my sister does the same thing. She hates her teeth so she tries to keep her mouth closed when she smiles. It makes her lips look odd.    Also, a quarter turn with her face facing forward is not a good angle for her. She has wide cheeks so it makes her face look a bit flat.

AA10347754	I acepted what I had been taught until I was about  15. Then I started thinking for myself. I arrived at the same conclusion as you did. For the past 35 years I have strived to conform to my own standards of morals, because that is what I know I should do. Not because of fear of Hell, or a hope of Heaven. If these were my reasons, then I'd be acting on selfish principles only. I wish to be able to look myself in the eyes in the mirror and say: I respect this person. Like I said, I've worked on it for 35 years now, and I think I'm getting there, lol. When I started to analyze and think, that was when I started to learn. About morals, ethics, principles and standards, about duties, about myself.

I believe in gay marriage, I think tattoos are ok, I believe birth controls and abortion are not wrong, I don't believe sex is only for creating children...    I believe it's wrong to lie, use and betray people (especially if they were good to you), it's wrong to cheat on your lover, and it's wrong to murder without good reason. (abortion is not murder).  Yes, I think it is possible for people to be good human beings and they don't need christianity to do it.|`|AA12236041	Until recently I believed that authority figures are always right.

To question these beliefs, these teachings, is a reinforcement of the ways you were taught. One either rebels and adapts them self to the thinking's that best fit ones values, or one clings more strongly to the imprinted ideas and teachings. to explore the beliefs and behaviors of other religions and cultures expands us out of our tiny self world to see and know there are other religions, cultures, worlds to experience|`|AA12018588	well, I was raised catholic and i study in a catholic skool n i have a class that is all about the catholics believes n all that n have mass at the skool the one that i had to go no matter what cuz it was at skool time,n when i graduated from 8 grade I had to mass (the same thing as in 12 grade) but i really dont consider myself catholic im young I know but o keep questioning about the catholics beliefs n I dont consider myself a true catholic.

As for some of the diverse blatherings above me:    I think efw needs to be sure that dogma really is incompatible with logic by actually looking at it first.  Because the foundations of Christian dogma are found most stated in the works of St. Thomas Aquinas, who took his method from Aristotle, the chief figure thought of in conjunction with logic.    As for bareicutie:  I get the feeling that my religion is being dissed.  I'm a Catholic.  Catholicism has been around in every country of the world for almost two thousand years; it was established by the most recognized figure in the history of time (we base our calendars around him) and it has NEVER ONCE changed its dogma.  But I still believe it.  I hardly think myself a sheep for doing so.

I know the common misconception of ~13 billion light years is probably what you're thinking of, but this is a measurement of the observable part only...    Also, in regards to the proposed limited understanding of the human brain... It has been proven that our minds are computationally universal. We possess the ability to solve any algorithmic problem, in other words, anything that any computer can solve, or any group of computers, or any group of people, can always be solved (with sufficient time and space) by a single brain. Although the memory capacity of the brain is limited (at the very least by the uncertainty principle) we have the extraordinary ability to access external memory systems (by use of pen and paper and symbolic recognition, for example) On the other hand, there are known problems which either cannot be solved algorithmically or no solution is currently known. However, depending on some unanswered questions about the composition of reality, it may be possible to solve these problems as well, for example the halting problem, by use of a degree of Turing machines called an oracle. Although such a system may or may not be possible it can fortunately be simulated by a universal Turing machine with an infinite amount of time.    -NPolynomial  http://novaconceptions.blogspot.com

0688c7bc012cb2ff3e5503830d2c997eaa	Moral is having good and wise judgement. ...or lets put it this way. If a girl does not want to have sex before marraige, thats having morals right. If a girl sleeps with every guy she sees, she has none, or she lacks some. the girl who wont until marriage has respect for herself and others, while on the other hand, that other girl will probably end up with an STD. there you go thats my answer for you.|`|69e96ad8e0df797740c322c910ce6fb8aa	Romeo, each culture and religion offer their own views of what is morality - that is how to be good and what is to be good. You don't have to choose between being moral or immoral - no point to bother. These are very culture-specific categories.    I guess you only need to be true to yourself and to your God(s), and remember you are a human.|`|AA11293813	Morality is the foundation of having a conscience.     Having a conscience is the foundation of free will. Free will gives us the opportunity to be human as opposed to being an automoton.    You should be moral because it promotes harmony and happiness.|`|AA10058925	Morality is an innate sense of what is right.  Immorality is used to describe either the lack of that sense or the ignoring of it.  Who says what is right?  Well, it is not who so much as it is what.  Think about it.  If something you do causes pain to you or someone else, should you do it?  Not just physical pain, but emotional pain as well.  It is a natural tendency for humans not to have the desire to "hurt" and to have compassion.  Immorality is the opposite of that.
Y0ffbZKraa	Go ahead, but it's no where near as good as people pretend it is. The characters are flat, the "vampires" aren't Vampires, what little plot there is in the whole series can be predicted from book one, Stephanie Meyers used an excessive amount of adjectives.

The best direction I can offer is to shift the way you think into being completely explicit in what you want to find. A death record is many things.. it could be a tombstone, the dates alone, an obituary, the death certificate itself.. and so forth.   Who? When? Where? then zoom in. The ONLY 'pay' site I have ever used in 30+ yrs is ancestry.com, and even they don't have it all.  I still find tons of info every day..from other sources.

C77c0OE2aa	You can use GIMP for selective coloring. It is free to download.    http://gimp.org    Here is the procedure:    http://www.gimpguru.org/Tutorials/Select...    Here is another method that is somewhat easier than the GIMP tutorial referenced above. This is written as pertains to Photoshop, but the same procedure should work in GIMP with possibly some slight changes in tool names.      First open your photo in your editing program..     Then go to Layer - Duplicate Layer     Click OK     Then go to Image - Adjustments - Hue / Saturation     Drag the Saturation slider all the way to the left to make the photo black and white.     Click OK     Then get the ERASER tool from the tool box on the left side of the screen. It is usually the next tool under the clone stamp tool. Just hover your mouse over the tool, and it will say Eraser.     When you have selected the Eraser, go up to the Brush options box at the top of the screen, and click on the downfacing arrow. Set the Hardness of the brush to 100% so you will have accurate control of selection. You may also need to raise or lower the brush size to suit.     Erase away any black and white from where you want the color to be revealed.     When done go to   Layer - Flatten Image     Then just do a Save As to wherever you want to save the photo.    steve

AA10663661	i am a malayali and i think it is easy t learn tamil because it is my neighbouring state and it somewhat resembles malayalam.If you have heard the song manasukkulle in autograph you must know it. But i think telugu can also be learned because my brother was working there and he learned telugu bit by bit.And by the way if you are worried about the job, unlike tamilians allthe elugu people know hindi.So if you know hindi you can survive in andhra.When we were there, i was worried to go to the market.But you know all of them know hindi which makes it a lot easier.It is like their language.But in Madras you have to speak tamil.And above all i think hyderabad is the best place to go if you have interest in computers.My brother started his career in hydbd and with his experience he is earning 50,000 now. You must be knowing that it is the country IT capital.  P.S- My dear ms.somebody, no language is stupid and you are really rude to have said that.I think  you owe an apology.All of the languages in this world are beautiful and you to not know that is STUPID.  Anybody agree with me?  FOR BIBLIO    p.s - malayalam is a lnguage which happened to start from sanskrit.But tamil is one of the oldest languages and has stood alone from all others.In case of malayalam , you can learn it too for eg; i will give you some....the order is hindi malayalam    neer....neeru  jeevan...jeevan  prem...premam  din....divasam  sheetal...sheetalam  yudh...yudham   mausam....maasam  kaal...kalam  megh...megham  varsha.....varsham  deep...deepam  gaana...gaanam  manushya...manushyan and a lot  and so on  malayalam is more similar to hindi because of its sanskrit origin but the usual tongue has words from tamil also....i am writing this incase you wanted you corrected ....    all the southern languages except tamil have its origin from sanskrit.Malayalam was heavily influenced bu tamil log way back from which it was freed by a poet ezhuthachan....    i hope this helps|`|127db927296546e1a2d4a005de4d5a31aa	OK, YOU SHOULD BETTER GO WITH TAMIL NADU.

Tell them what you need, from money to clothing and books and perhaps they can get their own youths to participate in fund raising for you.    you might have a little problem being from Nigeria though, I only say that because there seems to have been many fake money raising schemes from  Nigeria lately. If you look at eBay for instance, there are many people saying they won't sell to Nigeria and that is because of these scam artists using Nigeria addresses for some reason. But, I wish you the best of luck in your endeavor. I am sure that Church groups can verify each other easily and you won't have this problem.

I do have evidence for the "soul".    The existence of the soul may be shown by analysis of perception in terms of the table, light wave, neural impulse, mental image, and perceiver of the mental image (soul).    The argument is as follows:    Mp:  The most immediately known is most certainly known.  mp:  The self is most immediately known.          Therefore the self is most certainly known.    Reasons for the minor premise from the analysis of perception:    Table:  seen, shaped like a table, does not perceive itself, has size.    Light wave:  more immediate, not seen, not shaped like a table, does not perceive itself, has size (frequency).    Neural impulse (brain):  more immediate, not seen, not shaped like a table,does not perceive itself, last brain activity, has size (electrochemical).    Mental image (mind):  more immediate, seen, shaped like a table, does not perceive itself, not conceived of as having               any size.    Perceiver of the mental image:  most immediate, other than the mental image, perceives the mental image, aware of itself as perceiver of the mental image, not conceived of as having any size.    One has to go beyond the brain to get to the table that is seen in the mind.    The perceiver of the mental images is the same as the self, the soul, the mind, the spirit, the consciousness.  These are all words signifying the same reality.    Therefore, the soul is the perceiver of the mental images, the center perception in an individual, and is not conceived of as having any size (non-physical reality).

I've been blessed to never have something too hard for me to decide. So I had a bull calf with a broken leg, I set the bone braced it, dressed the wound. It got infected the leg swelled, I gave drugs, drained the wound, did everything to keep it healing. One night he was grunting in pain. I found him lying in the straw. He'd broken the brace and shattered the not fully healed bone. His foot hung by tendons he was in a ton of pain there was nothing I could do. I helped him outside and gave him some molasses, it's sweet they love it. When he was done I shot him, he went limp instantly never moving. I decided he'd suffered enough and I hope to never have to make that choice again. way long sorry.|`|zO4GeDVyaa	If your friend is abused by her parents, she should contact your local department of Child and Family Services.

Perch anche tra i fascisti ci saranno state brave persone, per obnubilate che non vedevano e non volevano vedere. Perch non ci si pu fasciare gli occhi da un partito, che poi diventa regime, che all'inizio ha portato ordine e fattivit, ma che poi ha commesso le peggiori nefandezze, soprattutto quella di aver appoggiato quel mostro di Hitler con le aberranti conseguenze che conosciamo.  In quanto agli omosessuali sono persone assolutamente normali, solo con gusti sessuali differenti, ma non pervertiti. La perversione si ha quando si usa la violenza e di etero pervertiti ne conosco un mucchio.  La realt  che i maschi spesso rifiutano gli omosessuali non perch, come dice una psicologia da strapazzo, rifiutano la loro parte omosessuale, ma perch hanno una folle paura di perdere il ruolo dominante maschile. Non a caso i fascisti erano contro gli omosessuali fino alla criminalit. Le donne in genere non hanno lo stesso orrore perch non hanno un ruolo da difendere. Ma esisitono anche donne maschiliste che rinnegano la propria femminilit.   La scusa della non proliferazione dei gay  una balla perch nel mondo abbiamo il problema dell'aumento demografico, tema a mio avviso molto sottovalutato che  il primo responsabile della fame nel mondo. Se in famiglia aumentasse il numero dei componenti la differenza si noterebbe. Ma viene misconosciuto perch non permette di sfogare l'odio.  Se i maschi rinunciassero a questo ruolo costruito sarebbero pi sensibili, infatti i gay sono molto pi comprensivi e intuitivi di molti etero, che spesso sono chiusi nei sentimenti per paura di mostrarsi deboli, cio sensibili.  Comunque una civilt non si riconosce tanto dalla tecnologia quanto dall'ampiezza di vedute, dalla tolleranza, dalla comprensione, ma pure dalla lucidit sui problemi, perch in genere si guardano le cose con estremismo, a seconda dei dettami del partito.  Per me sia il razzismo contro i gay, sia il razzismo contro gli americani sono forme di incivilt.

Ama il maschio muscoloso, forte, potente, che conquista e penetra la storia e i deboli con la sua " spada" solo che, contemporaneamente nega, che questo tipo di amore,possa essere una forma di espressione dell'omosessualit, forse  per questo che odia gli omosessuali, gli ricordano questo aspetto delle sue convinzioni e ne ha paura.

Cos come ci sono gay ottime persone e gay delinquenti.    Io personalmente preferirei essere fascista che gay, ma solo perch mi disgusta l'idea di andare con una persna dello stesso mio sesso. Con questo non vuol dire che essere gay sia discriminativo o patologico.... Lo strovo semplicemente contro natura, ma forse anche l'essere omosessuale  contemplato nelle diversit della natura.

c78a575e839f4afd620bdf67c3257b9daa	Yeah, I've heard of it. A lot of people still search for General Yamashita's gold, which was stolen from all the lands that his japanese forces occupied in world war II.    This is an article from wikipedia:  Yamashita's gold is the name given to loot worth billions of dollars stolen from East and Southeast Asia by Japanese forces during World War II and hidden in the Philippines.    Yamashita's army from 1942 to 1945, during the Japanese conquest and occupation of South East Asia in World War II looted banks, depositorys, Mosques, temples, churches, shops, museums and private homes for the purposes of stealing precious metals and treasures, to be shipped to the Philippines for trans-shipment to Japan. Because of growing Allied control of shipping routes, it became increasingly difficult to transport such cargo safely and much of it was concealed in the Philippines. Some ships on route, were also sunk.    The treasure trove takes its name from General Yamashita Tomoyuki, who assumed command of Japanese forces in the Philippines in 1944. Much of it had been assembled and buried before his arrival. In most cases, the gold and other treasures were buried by prisoners of war who were then entombed with it, in booby-trapped locations. Former President Ferdinand Marcos is believed to have obtained part of his personal fortune from it. In 1995, Philippine government agents recovered two tones of platinum with a value of US$480 million, part of the hoard and aside from these finds, if others finds did occur they are not documented sufficiently to verify.    When the Gold was buried, it was done in anticipation that the Americans may defeat the Japanese and the underground vaults, tunnel, and entrances were booby trapped with gas, explosives and with water. The water traps were created by digging 300 - 350 feet underground in the dry months, at which time the water table was at its lowest.    An recognised study by Robert Szatmary the leading authority on treasure gold bullion purchasing eliminates doubt and opposes the concept of rumors;    The legal case of ROGER ROXAS and THE GOLDEN BUDHA CORPORATION, v. FERDINAND E. MARCOS and IMELDA MARCOS, heard in Hawaii is a legal claim for payment of Yamashita Treasure Gold, stolen by Ferdinand Marcos from Roger ROXAS, who was a treasure hunter that found that trove of Yamashita Gold in underground tunnels. The trove included Gold bars, a Golden Buddha statue, and precious stones. Prolonged legal actions of the highest order caused various Hawaiian court rulings proving that the Yamashita treasure Gold recovered by Roxas, entitled him to a major share of the proceeds. The litigation exposed the vulnerability of treasure hunters who find Yamashitas Gold. The treasure hunter of past was almost powerless in opposing the Philippines Government should it order surrender of discovered Yamashita Gold and treasure, to it.    The Philippines Government have laws are in place clarifying the profit sharing arrangements, relating to recovered Yamashita Treasure. The laws also set out the treasure hunters obligations, the method of sharing the proceeds showing that the "urgan legend" proponants, are ill informed.    Profit Sharing Laws of the Republic of the Philippines    Department of Environment and Natural Resources - ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER No. 2004  33, Amendments to Department of Environment and Natural Resources Administrative Order No. 2002-04, Otherwise Known as the Rules and Regulations Governing the Issuance of Permits for Treasure Hunting, Shipwreck/Sunken Vessel Recovery and Disposition of Recovered Treasures/Valuable Cargoes, Including Hoarded Hidden Treasures. Section 14 (Sharing) offers the following benefits for treasure recovery :    After an audited report of expenses has been evaluated and approved by the Oversight Committee, the sharing of the net proceeds shall be as follows:    a).For Treasure Hunting within Public Lands  Seventy-five percent (75%) to the Government and twenty-five (25%) to the Permit Holder; b).For Treasure Hunting in Private Lands  Thirty Percent (30%) to the Government and Seventy Percent (70%) to be shared by the Permit Holder and the landowner; and c).For Shipwreck/Sunken Vessel Recovery  Fifty percent (50%) to the Government and Fifty percent (50%) to the Permit Holder.    Conclusion: It follows that an actual legal case exists in which payments were ordered, for the benfit of treasure hunters and that the payment orders were based on facts before the court, proving the existence and recovery of stolen treasure gold and;    The Philippines Government have enacted laws proteting its interest in recovered Yamashita treasure gold and laws are not created to support fictional posibilities, but genuine circumstancs.      The "gold" is gold bullion to religious statues. The plan was that the treasure from Asia was to finance Japan's war effort. The treasure had to be transported from the continent back to Japan, via the sea. Most of the stolen treasure from South East Asia was first shipped to the port of Singapore, where it was then relayed to the Philippines. From the Philippines, it was intended that the treasure would be shipped to the Japanese home islands.    However, as the Pacific War progressed, Allied submarines and aircraft took a heavy toll on Japan's shipping. The Japanese then took the treasure and hid it in caves and underground complexes throughout the Philippines, hoping to recover it after the war was over. However, many of those who knew of the locations of the loot were either executed or incarcerated for war crimes, including Yamashita. Thus, the whereabouts of the treasure were lost. Many years later, Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos discovered some locations of the treasure, and his recoveries are known as the "Marcos gold". The Roxas case, proves that Marcos |`|AA12121778	http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/war/games/y...|`|AA11819259	This is taken directly from the link below:      "He was known as the Tiger of Malaya. A skilled commander in the Pacific War, Gen. Tomoyuki Yamashita masterminded the quick capture by the Imperial Army of Malaysia and Singapore against a much larger force of Allied soldiers. Toward the end of the war, Yamashitas forces tried in vain to repel U.S. forces retaking the Philippines.  Yet despite such an illustrious career as a battlefield commander, Yamashitas name these days is most frequently connected to his purported treasure  a vast amount of gold, gems and currency looted from various Asian countries during the war.    According to treasure hunters and a few investigative journalists, Yamashita ordered some of his soldiers to stash the loot in various places in the Philippines during the closing stages of the war."|`|6d898a4ea9e1636a1f965445312b95eeaa	yes but all said now|`|fa6dd0d0c35b5a678011699be4670c2faa	yes, I already heared this yamashita's treasure. actually  I've surprise incountered a site and we had dug it until we had reach to the cement at 60 ft.+5 ft.cement but we had stopped it due to financial problem. we found markers at every 4 ft..we encountered chimecals 3 times that almost killed our men. markers were very will done that all sides had signs like * y A p F M face of japanese gen,. foot, heart,fish, sun etc.....lots of it.including 2 buddhas.

And try to learn from both of those aspects.  Then take those lessons into our next relationsip.    There is a grieving that happens when there is a 'death' of anything - & love qualifies for that too.  We need to allow ourselves to grieve - the grieving process is:  Disbelief,  Denial,  Anger,  Bargaining/Depression & finally acceptance.   For me I have to write about those 5 passages - I will put a heading "Disbelief" & then write about what that means to me in the particular instance.  Then put the next heading & write about that & so on.  This is very helpful in validating the feelings & acknowledging what happened & what we went through, & to help us find closure on it.    Good luck.

l62gZcMEaa	try google|`|A01w1dHqaa	Thanks for the quote. Here's another.<br>  <br>  Cowards die many times before their death. The valiant never tastes of death but once. Of all the wonders that I yet have heard it seems to me most strange, that men should fear, seeing that death, a necessary end, will come when it will come.<br>  <br>  Shakespeare who was most probably Sir Francis Bacon.<br>  <br>  <br>  All fear in life comes from our own minds. Our thoughts of needing to attack another out of fear bring us the thought that someone else can and wants to hurt us. <br>  <br>  A child (innocence) shall lead us.|`|cWuumdy7aa	DEATH is one of the subject matters that most people, particularly the old folks, fear to talk about. Euphemisms such as "passed away," "departed," "gone on," and "no longer with us" replaced the word "death." In polite society, the subject of death becomes taboo. <br>  <br>  But then, man needs to be exposed to death and dying. Carl Jung said, "The question of the meaning and worth of life never becomes more urgent or more agonizing than when we see the final breath leave a body." <br>  <br>  Fear of the unknown is man's greatest fear. "Death is still a fearful, frightening happening, and the fear of death is a universal fear even if we think we have mastered it on many levels," wrote Elizabeth Kubler-Ross in an excellent book, 'On Death and Dying.' <br>  <br>  Well, our failure to talk about death further intensifies our anxiety about it. In truth, all of life is lived in the light of its inevitable end. No one can make sense of life until he comes to terms with its termination. <br>  <br>  But what is death in the first place? Charles C. Colton says: " Death is the liberator of him whom freedom cannot release, the physician of him whom medicine cannot cure, and the comforter of him whom time cannot console." <br>  <br>  Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote: "Our fear of death is like our fear that summer will be short, but when we have had our swing of pleasure, our fill of fruit, and our swelter of heat, we say we have had our day." William Somerset Maugham notes: "Death is a very dull, dreary affair, and my advice to you is to have nothing whatever to do with it." <br>  <br>  David Meltzer informs, "Death teaches us to live; it gives us a boundary to map our living within. Death's hammer breaks through the mirror separating us from light." Isaac Asimov is more direct: "Life is pleasant. Death is peaceful. It's the transition that's troublesome." <br>  <br>  Midrash Tanhuma equates birth and death to ships: "Why do we rejoice over a ship setting out on a journey when we know not what she may encounter on the seas? We should rejoice when the ship returns safely to the port." <br>  <br>  Epicurus urges: "Death does not concern us, because as long as we exist, death is not here. And when it does come, we no longer exist." Francis Bacon likens death to a friend: "Death is a friend of ours; and he that is not ready to entertain him is not at home." <br>  <br>  Among those so-called heroes, death is always part of their existence. The late Senator Benigno S. Aquino was assassinated because of his love for the Filipino people. "Filipinos are worth dying for," he declared. Nathan Hale echoes: "I regret that I have but one life to give for my country." <br>  <br>  Sir Patrick Henry wonders: "Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains or slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take but as for me; give me liberty or give me death!" <br>  <br>  What the difference between heroes and cowards? In the play 'Julius Caesar,' William Shakespeare has the leading character say: "Cowards die many times before their deaths; the valiant never taste of death but once." Heywood Brown also reminds, "He who dies a thousand deaths meets the final hour with the calmness of one who approaches a well remembered door." <br>  <br>  During burial, we often see people crying. It is but natural; they won't see the departing person anymore. "Tears are sometimes an inappropriate response to death," explains Julie Burchill. "When a life has been lived completely honestly, completely successfully, or just completely, the correct response to death's perfect punctuation mark is a smile." <br>  <br>  When it comes to death, there is no rich or poor, beauty or ugly, healthy or sickly. "The sole equality on earth is death," penned Philip James Bailey. <br>  <br>  John James Ingalls agrees: "In the democracy of the dead all men at last are equal. There is neither rank nor station nor prerogative in the republic of the grave." <br>  <br>  But death should not be feared. Saint Paul states: "For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain." Sir Winston Churchill quips: " I am ready to meet my maker, but whether my maker is prepared for the great ordeal of meeting me is another matter."|`|bnRDldxbaa	The way i see it=<br>  Death is all around us & with us every day.

(Phrase Origins)        does not occur as such in any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock  Holmes stories, although Holmes does exclaim "Elementary" in "The  Crooked Man", and says "It was very superficial, my dear Watson, I  assure you" in "The Cardboard Box".  The first recorded  juxtaposition is in the 1929 film _The Return of Sherlock Holmes_  (the first Holmes film with sound).       The original stories never mention an Inverness cape, a  deerstalker hat, or a meerschaum pipe, either.  Those props are due  to illustrators and to actors.

But, ever since Ever was in a car accident which killed her parents and sister, she could hear people's thoughts, see auras, and a person's life story just from touching someone. Thinking she's crazy, she tries to shut herself out from everyone by becoming an outcast at school. But everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste. Ever sees Damen and feels an instant recognition. He is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy, and he holds many secrets. Damen is able to make things appear and disappear, he always seems to know what she’s thinking—and he’s the only one who can silence the noise and the random energy in her head. She doesn’t know who he really is—or what he is. Can she trust him?<br>  <br>  Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld<br>  It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br>  This book is also set in the future and gets pretty intense. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also some romance in it. One of my favorite books<br>  <br>  Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz<br>  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.<br>  <br>  Kissed by an Angel by Elizabeth Chandler<br>  Well, it's kind of three books in one. It's suppose to be about this guy, Tristian, and this girl, Ivy, who are crazy about each other. Ivy also has this strong belief in angels (like a water angel, a death angel, etc) which Tristian doesn't believe at all. But one day, they get in a car accident and Tristian dies and Ivy's belief in angels die with him and Ivy feels as if she has lossed everything. But, Tristian is still there, protecting her as an angel. But the problem is, Ivy keeps doubting about angels so no matter what Tristian does to try to help her, he hurts her more and Ivy feels more alone. Tristian soon realizes that their car accident wasn't an accident and whoever killed Tristian is trying to kill Ivy but can he save her im time?|`|dmOmUdqiaa	Hi, you might want to try my own recently published book, entitled "The Tales of Tanglewood: The Lon Dubh Whistle".<br>  <br>  You can download the first three chapters for free, at <a href="http://www.talesoftanglewood.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.talesoftanglewood.com</a><br>  <br>  Within the pages of the book, readers will discover Colin, a child who is fully aware of the hidden world of myth and wonder hiding within the woods just beyond his home, long kept secret by old magic.

cxDbdhELaa	Religion uses philosophy in an attempt to legitimize itself.|`|MPuvYkJRaa	Both religion and philosophy wrestle with problems like: What is good? What does it mean to live a good life? What is the nature of reality? Why are we here and what should we be doing? How should we treat each other? What is really most important in life?<br>  <br>  Clearly, then, there are enough similarities that religions can be philosophical (but need not be) and philosophies can be religious (but again need not be). Does this mean that we simply have two different words for the same fundamental concept? No; there are some real differences between religion and philosophy which warrant considering them to be two different types of systems even though they overlap in places. <br>  <br>  of the two only religions have rituals. In religions, there are ceremonies for important life events (birth, death, marriage, etc.) and for important times of the year.. Philosophies, however, do not have their adherents engage in ritualistic actions.<br>  <br>  Another difference is the fact that philosophy tends to emphasize just the use of reason and critical thinking whereas religions may make use of reason, but at the very least they also rely on faith, or even use faith to the exclusion of reason.<br>  <br>  The fact that religion and philosophy are distinct does not mean that they are entirely separate. Because they both address many of the same issues, it isn’t uncommon for a person to be engaged in both religion and philosophy simultaneously. They may refer to their activity with only one term and their choice of which term to use may reveal quite a lot about their individual perspective on life; nevertheless, it is important to keep their distinctness in mind when considering them.|`|9ab7c5b30122db984710185845f90cbfaa	Philosophy is just thinking BIG really.

Now is the time for research and to write more novels. You need to find out what genre your manuscript might fit into. Then find out what are the guidelines for that genre. The amount of words typically found in   each genre vary greatly. As does, the POV that is used and style. You want your novel to be unique yet not so far outside of the realm of what is selling that you have little chance of being accepted. You must teach yourself about formatting novels and the procedures for submitting them.Plus, you must commit to working on new material because that is how you improve your craft.  I am not sure what publisher would work for you without knowing what kind of novel you have written. But at your age you have plenty of time to find the right publisher when your work is ready.   You must educate yourself fully about the publishing industry and then it will become clear to you where you should submit your novel.

Boudreaux is a whimsical, cartoon alligator that is from Honey Island Swamp. He goes on different fun adventures with his buddies throughout South Louisiana. His biggest adventure is a more serious one. It's about his experiences of going through Hurricane Katrina. It teaches lessons about life, friendship and family.......through Boudreaux's wide-eyed innocence.  With the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina approaching in August, it is my hope that this book will touch the hearts of all who read it.

One that is worth asking, but not one worth losing your sanity over.. Despair encroaches when we first realize the seeming meaninglessness of life. But who says life can't be simultaneously meaningless and meaningful? I personally believe its both, as paradoxical as that sounds. There are some questions out there that religion doesn't answer satisfactorily for me. If I don't have religion to keep those fears at bay, then I'm pretty much facing the abyss on my own. How terrifying and alone that feels. In face of the harsh absolutes of life (death being, thus far, supported to be an absolute), I still think its possible to create some measure of self-evaluated meaning. That when you think of your own death, you feel less and less that twinge of regret, which clues you in to another question, "Am I living the life I want to be living? Or am I just being inexorably drawn to my death without so much as putting up a fight or taking a stand for my own edification?"<br>  <br>  Who's to say.. Why settle for survival? Survival is what our baser instincts tell us to do. But we have higher capacities to be put to a greater use. One must not waste those capacities, one must not settle for the everydayness or the inevitable! Read Nietzsche and you'll be inspired. You'll find that Nietzsche was very much an optimist.<br>  <br>  For those interested, I highly recommend reading "Staring at the Sun: Overcoming the Terror of Death" by Irvin Yalom. He's big on existential philosophy/psychology. The book helped me learn about my own death anxiety. Like you, I'm asking myself these heavy questions. I think the greater fault is not asking, regardless of the answers.|`|JLg8XNUCaa	Whatever sadness or pain you are going through right now, I will pray for you to endure.  Life is not meaningless.  We have been given a life that can be very fulfilling.  It's up to us to find how we can make a good life with what we have, and to help others along the way.  Please do not allow yourself to be overburdened with this feeling of hopelessness.  Find the strength from within to fight this depression, and think only of positive and good things.  Praying for you right now.|`|tNAGQzNnaa	It depends on how you look at it and it goes on the assumption that our physical existence is all there is.<br>  <br>  I won't tell you to go find religion - most are too illogical for my taste.  But if it's all truly pointless then why do we exist at all? If life is a universal fluke why are we able to ponder our own purpose?  A fluke on a fluke?<br>  <br>  Or is the real problem that you think your specific life is meaningless... well that's all up to you isn't it?  Go out and do something that will impact the world.... and trust me, your suicide might impact your friends and family the world won't give a ****.<br>  <br>  Check the history books - you don't have to be special, the past is full of common people who have done something that ripples through the ages... you just have to get up and do something.|`|fNpiRI9haa	lol i think that way too sometimes.

Hes overrated right now because he is playing a little dinged up. (even though i wouldnt mind seeing Leftwich play) <br>  P.S.  im a Jacksonville Fan so i know a little bit about the steelers since everytime we play its always a brute battle....|`|0KAIZymxaa	I have been trying to figure this one out since the superbowl he played in.  I hate to say it, but this QB is not playing well.  I am a huge fan of the Steelers, but thinks Big Ben needs a stay on the pine for a few games or so.  He has struggled and has been sacks numerous times.  Bring in Byron and things go a lot better no doubt.  Big Ben is hurting the team by throwing picks.  He actually keeps the opponents in the games.  Asking the defense to bail him out is asking too much.  Any other team would have sidelined him for sure.  One thing the steelers organization is known for is that they areloyall to a fault. Don't get me wrong I like Ben, but when it comes to Ws and Ls I like a winner.  Ben if you read this just know you are killing us right now.  Go get healthy and then show us what you got.  |`|zRZKdH1Zaa	Could you please inform me on who Big Ben is?|`|Grhy25bQaa	Like the clock?  I don't know, because it is old and huge?
GFnZS3quaa	it is Dr Rivers that attempts to heal character in Regeneration such as Owen and Sassoon. It is often portrayed that Sassoon and Prior are not actually traumatised. Sassoon is against the war and writes a declaration against it. The way Barker begins the novel with Sassoon's declaration is actually a historical document. If you read the end of the novel Dr yealland is a totally different character to Rivers and tortures is patients to extreme. Don't confuse the fictional characters of people like Owen, Sassoon, Graves and Rivers with the historical characters that Barker has based them on. Enjoy the book

And this has never been as true as when you are carried away by the strength of Naemer ibn El Barud powerful and unbelievable brief poetry. Each poem consist in one verse, each one of them with enough energy to make you ponder for months in its profound meaning and implications. Some of these verses could be in one mind for years, evolving, revolving and convoluting to reach one unfailing conclusion: there was no a better way to express that feeling, that fact, that wisdom. For wisdom is what these verses sublimate. Wisdom of an undeniable Oriental origin.  Each Verse (each poem, each sentence?) reveals an Eternal Truth with enigmatic accuracy, as if worded by an Angel or a Prophet. Each one seems to be the best until another strikes the unfathomable valleys of your soul, with the power of a rising Sun.    But the most amazing fact about El Barud poetry is its profusion. Those perfectly worded poems of one verse are not only present in Por Amor al Amor, but also in its Monoslabos (Monosyllables) divided in three volumes called La maana (The Morning), La Tarde (The Afternoon) and La Noche (The Night), in La Flecha y La Paloma (The Arrow and the Dove), in De Reyes y Vasallos (About Kings and Vassals), just to name a few.     El Barud is not to be read, but to be experienced. And this is a mystical experience. Profound. Elating. Amazing.                --------------------------------------...

Western philosophy is the journey outside your body and soul but Indian Philosophy is the journey towards your inner self. Western philosophy finds its solution outside them self and Indian philosopher seek the question of their answers in their soul. You will find every Indian philosopher is a saint but i don't think any western philosopher is a saint. western philosophy is based on logic and Indian philosophy is based on experience.|`|27a314f59b9c2654c6e82213f612350baa	I am no expert but I see it this way :  EAST - makes you submissive  WEST - makes you fight for more and more|`|8bb7564e6b51f403a948dbb1465c7692aa	I don't kwo what you are refering to in terms of "Easter Philosophy". So what I can say is what makes western unique: greek philosophy invented rational thought which much much later led to science. This legacy from our ancestors gave us the tools to dominate the world. But many eastern philosophies have a lot to offer, things that we do not have in our western philosophy: the power of meditation, the power of concentration, a certain spirituality which makes us stronger, happier and more able to face the challenges of life.|`|293de8d71655f607f483fcafd6b2e22baa	Eastern philosophy is more intellectual and mystical in nature, focus on what is for the good of the community, rather than the individual.  Western philosophy is more regulated by Judeo-Christian based laws, with focus on what is good for the individual rather than the community.    Western philosophy challenges you to look out for yourself, and outside yourself when looking for possible solutions to problems and issues.  Eastern phiolosophy challenges you to look INTO yourself for possible solutions to problems and issues.|`|464d616f730ca742ed9775667997d2acaa	Philosophy is the same. The difference is between persons.|`|AA11966875	I think the best way to sum it up is that Western Philosophies tend to center on material things, and that which can be observed, handled, tested empirically.  Eastern Philosophies tend to be based in an understanding that there is a spirit type part of humanity - termed soul, spirit, chi (qi), energy variously - which cannot be seen.|`|ca59b03b6d896e2be5cd0bccaba4fb1aaa	easterners have past karma where as westerners dont believe in karmas.|`|8f3c9fc7b4fc69cf62ef8458fa845a08aa	west v/s east is not the right way to differentiate.    You have the following philosophies  1. Christian  2. Islamic  3. Hindism  4. Buddhism    The following the major features I would say.    1. Christianity : It wants everybody to follow christianity. Believes in equality of men and women. They were generally agressive to spread the religion.    2. Islam : It also wants everybody to follow islam. Does not believe in equality of men and women. Does not accept other religions at any cost. Most aggressive and spreads intolerance.    3. Hinduism: Does not want everybody to follow it. Believes in peace. But internally creates castes and discriminates people.    4. Buddhism: Preaches non-violence. Probably the best religion to cure current problems in the world.

2AXwOgdQaa	I think it is the male response to the urge each one of us has inside towards Beauty and the need to satisfy that need to possess and own something beautiful, in the form of a beautiful woman, and, I suppose with the unconcious desire of ensuring that ones descendants will be equally beautiful, although it is not always the case!  Woman also look for Beauty in men, although this beauty is generally a little different.  Others find beauty in a persons intelligence, mind, personality, expression, talents, kindness, gestures, characeristics, etcetera.  Certainly it seems that Beauty is the greatest attraction, ?or am I wrong?|`|iKmkRaqBaa	Opposite poles attracts each other.  In choosing wife, days are gone with attraction and looks.New generation wants  a different understanding girl.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Subconsciously, a male is looking for a fertile female. health and youth do NOT enter into what makes a worthy male however, so biologically men have it easier.    We can be old, out of shape and ugly, so long as we have a job and they will want us.    It's sad really, the inequity of life.|`|AA11564934	males are more biologically attracted to physical traits than women are.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	This is instinct, all for the bettering of the group.  Male looks for attractive, etc. female because they are aroused.  Instinct makes it that way.  In so doing, they choose the healthiest, child-bearing possibilities.  The group is endowed with healthy children.    This is all good for all species but man.  Man is attracted to beautiful, yes, maybe even to some degree to potential-mother of their children.  That's where everything stops.  Man has the ability to prevent childbirth.  He can have an unlimited number of partners.    It can lead to greedy dogs, yes.  But that was not the way it was intended.    TX Mom|`|OUbNSXjJaa	It is their philosophy.|`|yuuvBSKsaa	On the primal level you want your offspring to be attractive so you pursue a mate you find attractive.    Now it's not like women don't prefer handsome men, it's just that men get a break on this because women are looking for more.       Human children take a lot of time & energy to raise.  Women typically provide most the time (aka nurture)   Men most the energy (aka money)     Because women must ALSO look for success, wealth & loyalty, Men 'get a break' on their looks.  For men talent, ambition & the willingness to commit get added to their total 'attractiveness', Women are willing to 'trade down' regarding looks.    Women, on the other hand,  are expected to commit to their offspring, and NOT expected to be the primary wage earner, hence LOOKS tend to predominate their attractiveness to men.      Got it?   Success in irrelevant, commitment is taken for granted, so men go primarily by beauty.    Permanence is not required of her beauty, merely that she pass it to her children.|`|OANl5PPoaa	answer to your question is not needs heart it needs the intellectual purity also .as long as my concern. i am  a beauty lover.my way of beautyis like an attractive woman no matter how beautiful she may be BUT if she works as a controler of the public,like police,lawer or the type of work that needs some strictness,she will never be my wife but can be my good friend only.but abeauty with the work that is polite to all and help in the way of healing others emotions to make them nice to each other that is the kind of attractive woman will be mine for ever.iknow what ever she today ,tomorrow she will not be same but her heart who is the source of beauty to a real woman will be there always because i will be 100%there for her to keep that way in my heart. so iam a slave of beauty but do not want to have more than one master.love the beauty and respact the nature.is my slogn. thanks.|`|ca2585b8fcfeb0a5bcda1c6a7dfdca10aa	Stupidity!

But there are definitely two kinds of guys:    Guys that want to get married (or settle down) and guys that just want to get some tail.      The first set of men are willing to look beyond physical beauty to the woman inside:  will she make a good wife, be my best friend, support me and love our children, etc.  The second set NEVER looks at that.|`|E7GwqMotaa	well we live in a world take base on looks ........ actresses singers all have to look top of the line and that's what we all chasing ....      i fell in love in my wife way before i met her that was on the phone and she is the best thing ever happened to me .    she is sexy and good looking but i fell in-love way before i saw her.|`|E3ShF8xdaa	Um not every male is the exact same.  If i posted a question why do all girls choose men with lots of money it would be just as relevent.|`|W4Dek41Jaa	Mhm.  I totally agree, I bet if a guy fell in love with someone over the internet, and later learned they weren't the most attractive person in the world he would loose all love for her.  Which he shouldn't. Also I think that some men THINK they are in love and get married to early then realize that they choose their lover for their looks.  I think as they get older they realize that you can't do that anymore.  Some of them don't even care, and just continue to choose women that they find beautiful and use them for sex.  I can't stand men like that, it's disgusting.  How they treat women like toys.  Then some of them grow up, which are the men that people continue to search for.  Half of them never do though.  But yea, I think it's ridiculous.   [:

I think that the majority of women look for someone they can trust, whom they are compatible and who makes them happy...  it depends on the woman.|`|aCDWwsisaa	A smart girl (or guy) looks for someone they know they will still enjoy talking to (and laughing with) 50 years in the future...|`|yuuvBSKsaa	The fundamental task of life is to reproduce.    Because Human more trainable but less instinctual, they have comparatively long childhoods.   I.e. they require a lot of time & energy.    Women generally provide most the time (aka nurture)  Men generally provide most the energy (aka money)    So EVERYONES looking for good genes - aka handsome/beautiful.    Women are additionally looking for someone who's good at providing (aka successful) and willing to commit.    Men who are looking to commit are additionally looking for loving & loyal companions, and men who aren't are pretty much trying to nail all the pretty girls.    But keep in mind that half the population is below average intelligence, and affluent societies often lose track of their primal instincts & purpose.    So there are a lot of stupid girls & boys chasing stupid romance.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	In philosophy? I searched in Webster dictionary for this word parterner. I am not able to find. I spent hours. Hence I am not able to answer.|`|W5JjCD9gaa	Such an answer cannot be answered objectively, because people's varying tastes render the question as subjective.     What is beauty? What is desire?     One man's conception of beauty may repulse another, thus their desires will vary. Asking another person what they desire in a partner may help you question your own desires, but ultimately, it will not answer them.|`|z15RhXfjaa	Security  Companionship  Trust  Loyalty  Love  Happiness  Laughter  Common interests    Oh and of course, sexual attraction!|`|FoIxsunVaa	Stereotypically, a woman wants a man who can provide and make a safe place for her to raise her children. not all women feel this way, but this is an instinct in most women, even if they are uninterested in or unable to have kids.    Women want another set of contradictory things in men, typically. The want a man who is self-assured and knows who he is and then they want to change everything about him. This is based on the contradiction between typical men's thinking and typical women's thinking.  Men are always in "fix it' mode, which comes off to women as dismissive. Women are usually in "connect" mode which men misinterpret as being needy or insecure.    If you can try and take conversation as interaction rather than as just information you will go far with talking to women. If a woman tries to change you, be flattered, it means she is comfortable with you. Stay true to yourself, but give the appearance of an open mind at least. Realize she is trying to BOND with you by OBLITERATING any trace of you. Enjoy the link and sidestep the obliteration.    Good Luck.

AA12343309	My answer is lengthy and I apologize for that but I want to warn you of the advantages and the pitfalls of genealogy on the internet.    Websites that only have family trees are not worth a plug nickel unless you are willing to verify the information with documents/records. They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.    I recently found I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1956. Hey! we've been dead for 52 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!    I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.    This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.    Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family trees.     Cyndi'sList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.     Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.    However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.    Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.     A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.     They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know.|`|AA11053540	You should start by asking all your living relatives about family history. Then, armed with that information, you can go to your public library and check to see if it has a genealogy department. Most do nowadays; also, don't forget to check at community colleges, universities, etc. Our public library has both www.ancestry.com and www.heritagequest.com free for anyone to use (no library card required).  Another place to check out is any of the Mormon's Family History Centers. They allow people to search for their family history (and, NO, they don't try to convert you).  A third option is one of the following websites:  http://www.searchforancestors.com/...     http://www.censusrecords.net/?o_xid=2739...     www dot usgenweb dot com/     www dot census dot gov/     http://www.rootsweb.com/     www dot ukgenweb dot com/     www dot archives dot gov/     http://www.familysearch.org/     http://www.accessgenealogy.com/...     http://www.cyndislist.com/     www dot geni dot com/    Cyndi's has the most links to genealogy websites, whether ship's passenger lists, ancestors from Africa, ancestors from the Philippines, where ever and whatever.    Of course, you may be successful by googling: "john doe, born 1620, plimouth, massachusetts" as an example.    Good luck and have fun!    Check out this article on five great free genealogy websites:    www dot associatedcontent dot com/article...    Then there is the DNA test; if you decide you want to REALLY know where your ancestors came from opt for the DNA test. Besides all the mistakes that officials commonly make, from 10% to 20% of birth certificates list the father wrong; that is, mama was doing the hanky-panky and someone else was the REAL father. That won't show up on the internet or in books; it WILL show up in DNA.  I used www.familytreedna.com which works with the National Geographics Genotype Program.

Whether modern day or historical statements and witness accounts and rarely rue unbiased or precise. Motivation, character of the scribe and his personal held beliefs are given consideration when analysing data or processing facts to form a historical portrait of happenings and their place in history and the world.    The modern day disasters are embroiled is counter allegatory denials and rebuttals as to cause, culprit and engineered consequence, it can be deduced and rightly in times of yore political affiliations and agendas dictated what words were preserved and works destroyed or edited to suit the purposed of the prevailing regimes in power.  |`|n46X2Zy6aa	well, we might never know.  history is generally considered fact, but why you dig a little deeper, some parts are simply too far fetched or .. stupid.   take, for example, the vikings.   they destroyed many churches, so the church decided that, since they had destroyed so many of their sacred buildings, that they would depict the vikings as the devil.  remember the horns on the viking's helmets? pure fiction. the church wanted to make the vikings appear more "devilish", so they added horns to their helmets.     history can lie!    |`|HhD35Z9vaa	You are right it can be because of lack of document or exageration.|`|M0eyMvqlaa	We really can't.

Also, there is always 3 sides to any story, both parties view and the truth.|`|6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	Most of the "facts" are true, but not the whole truth and many things we now consider important  we know almost nothing about. The interpretation   and meaning of the fact is mostly the opinions of the writer so as our cultural values change we have new histories written reinterpreting the same facts.    If you do not documents  or other evidence to prove something it is not a fact.
b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	In my opinion both. Even in nature, although you may not have "marriages" many mammals stick together, forming family type situations, having a monogamy type relationships such as beaver's, foxes, bats, deer's. One thing to take into account is that they only make up about 3.5 % of the animal world and occurs mostly in mammals. So i believe that it is surely something natural but "pushed" on society...maybe so we don't breed and over-breed.|`|ibmaCfAfaa	Its a socially conditioned response taught to most peoples who follow a belief system where polygamy or having more than one life partner is taboo. In America this is pounded into youngsters heads from birth in most cases (thankfully not in mine).  You grow up, get married (to someone of the opposite sex most of society hopes, lol) and have a family. Much pressure is placed on the young to follow this template, though, this appears to be changing. Many cultures vary; it is best to look at as many as one can before one chooses what manner in which one lives out their life.  Humans dislike change, and this is played upon by this ideology here in the States. If your entire life has been tuned to behave in a certain manner it can be very hard to except different views or customs. Being in the service I saw many cultures, some I found better, some worse than my home country of America was on this aspect of life.  In simple terms, choose your poison, but be prepared to deal with societies sometimes force fed antidotes.

E1Tbhswbaa	I think both songs you mentioned would work well.  The Girl I Mean To Be is a similar range and style to what Wendy has to sing. The song is a little slow, but that suits Wendy.  Wendy's solo song is a lullaby after all.  Lyrical songs are the best when you are auditioning for Wendy.  Just be careful.  I do not recommend you use the british accent in an audition song.  They want to hear you real voice first.  Add the accent in for callbacks.  Either song could work and I would pick the one I was the most comfortable with and sound the best singing.  I hope this helps and good luck.|`|0SGxN0c1aa	i dont think that song is good for wendy, i auditioned and got called back for wendy and Tiger lily, i ended up getting Tiger Lily. i sang i feel pretty it is a great song! i also sung it for Alice in Wonderland (i got chesire cat) and i also sung it for wizard of oz and got dorothy.

lu4eEBdJaa	I would want to live in a world of peace. However, there will never be world peace. Everyone's' lives revolves around the human natures of greed, lust, and envy. Unless we all see our flaws and mistakes, and actually attempt to change them, the world will ever see common peace. |`|AA11870379	No peace, without being subjugated, was ever achieved by peace......In other words, acting peaceful never won a war.  Unfortunately, peace has always been acheived by first fighting your enemy, winning and then establishing a peaceful way of living with one another.  Fighting usually continues until one side triumphs over the other in taking of life or financially.......then the sides meet and settle.....not all the time amicably however.  As humans we all want to live peacefully, those of us who do not profit by war, but there are those who want to force their beliefs on the rest of the world even to the extent that they will kill to acheive their goal.  Usually these people will lose as history has shown us that good always triumphs over evil in the end.  How do you differentiate as to who are the good and who are the evil?  Well, usually the evil show no concern for innocent human life as long as they achieve what they want and they will always declare that the taking of those lives is a necessary thing and therefore permissable in their eyes.  This is the true evil.  I would always choose to live in a peaceful world with equality for all.  Regards, Dick|`|aab54bfcfabb62f5361dd17ce083cbe8aa	How do you seriously dream of a world at peace?

Proper communication and understanding of one another. A world without greed and jealousy...    But how would we keep the world from getting overpopulated is the question?|`|ErwP75Mlaa	I prefer the world as it is now    Mind you the only life in which is not in harmony with nature is the human race. Even if we are long gone, nature will one day return the balance. The universal truth in which I know is that life consumes other life so that it may live, which disproves any concepts of life being sacred. If anything it is cannibalistic in design.    We see China as a overpopulated country who upholds a law on the number children one can have. You have many poverty stricken countries as you do war torn that create a low survival rate to prevent such possibilities. Yet in America we outsource our support through force or donations of aid to these countries so that one day they can grow to be like us.    And what are we in america...we are consumers. And we consume more than material objects, we are plagued by people who live to eat rather than eat to live. Ultimately through peace there is no war and these countries will be able to flourish like us, and as peace spreads and populations rise, and national defense budgets are used to combat only poverty.    Then you will see a rise in the need for livestock to feed these masses of people in each country, who are like the american middle class. Currently livestock accounts for 19% of greenhouse gas emissions. Ultimately through peace you destroy this world, therefore being a contributor to the genocide of the human race and making it nearly impossible for most lifeforms to exist on this planet.

Even if the first thing that comes to me is a plot idea, I scribble that down and then start thinking about the people, because they're the ones who are going to help you out in the end.  Eventually we all (or most of us) hit a point where you just don't know what will happen next, or you know what will happen in the end, but how to get there, or how to fill up the boring space between, is just unknown.  That's when your characters and the strength of their personalities intersect with the plot and carry it forward.    So I take out a blank sheet of paper and title it with my character's name and then, in narrative form (I prefer it to listing), I describe them completely- what they look like, their history, including quotes from them.  Usually what starts to happen is I find myself sneaking into the plot and writing broad sketches of the story.  I do this for all my characters, and usually by then I'm very excited about writing, and the plot is all in place.  I make sure I have the outline of the plot written out (just a few paragraphs or a page), and let it stew in my mind.    When I finally choose to write, I get down a bare-bones structure of each major scene that turns the plot, and call those 'chapters', even though I might change the structure as I write.  This is just to keep me in line.  Then I do whatever writing I'm going to for the day (I usually try to finish whatever 'scene' I end on), and then I write a note to myself of what the next scene should be to remind me for tomorrow.    That's how I wrote my first novel, and it worked for me.  Just remember that everyone has a different method that works for them.

Also when a person who does not get rids himself permanently of his desire and remains immersed in the joy of self, he is not to be known as a m an of steady wisdom. A person whose mind is perturbed in sorrow and has  craving for pleasures, and who is not free from passion, anger and fear is  a non-qualifier to attain  steady wisdom. Such person not qualified of steady wisdom is disturbed when assailed by misery, he is frustrated by blind hope of happiness.

Later  saved my life twice with the technique his group teaches and then married the woman of my dreams. Ikeda is the current president of SGI.  Life Decryption Key  By Generalist 12-08     Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects. This document is intended for people who want to be responsible for their lives, and who accept that causes produce effects. Effects are produced by causes and  we have to make the right causes to get the effects we want. Those who want to control their lives rationally and responsibly, and accept that effects are produced by causes, please read on.    Instead of guiding ones life by the flurry of concepts, hopes, fears, and aphorisms we learn, it is more effective to conduct daily life while using a concise, accurate and short set of reality descriptions. We need a mental key to make the jumble understandable and make decisions more accurate and easier to enact.     The key exists. It is intended strictly to improve the conduct of daily life. It is a primer on how to improve the here and now. The future will be determined by how we deal with the present.     The question naturally occurs, What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?    Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. Think of brain, body, table, car clouds, air, soil, and on without limit. Yet, there is no mind without a brain. There is no car without thought. There is no wood for a table without the intangible life of a tree. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the words Myoho.      Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.    Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is.       The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing.     This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones. It was derived over thousands of years by brilliant people in India and China and finally used as the title of the Lotus Sutra in Kumarajivas translation of the Lotus Sutra. A 13th century Japanese monk named Nichiren recognized it for what it is and realized that anyone could guide their life better by using this key. He discovered the great treasure of life where anyone had access to it and dedicated his life to providing clarification and access.    The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focus the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.    Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.  For more detailed information see   http://www.sgi-usa.org.

If we could focus on the true nature of reality and eliminate the term 3rd world, then we would see much more mutual respect for one another. This would give a more reliable appearance of equality.     Our perspective in the West is that we've been taught that life is infinitely valuable. This is all relative. Elsewhere life is cheap and hard. Once the resources cease to exist which prop up the value of life (police, medicine, available jobs), then it will fall. 150k years ago equality wasn't even a concept.     = works well in mathematics though.

It's impossible to get to and full of guilt. Feel equality if that helps you but if not then why bother? Equality is this idea we have created so that we don't have to communicate our inequalities. Our inequalities are our strengths. We aren't the same for a very good reason. Growth and change. Equality can exist in a certain respect, but that's something I personally don't really care for. I think it's kind of impersonal. Communication is how we change and grow, not through equality.

A?os ms tarde volveran a aparecer, sin compartir ninguna escena, en la produccin de Hal Roach 45 Minutes from Hollywood (1926). Su primera pelcula oficial como do cmico establecido fue The Second Hundred Years en junio de 1927, dirigida por Fred Guiol y supervisada por Leo McCarey, al que se considera con toda probabilidad como padre de la idea del do.    A partir de 1927 desarrollaron su carrera bajo los auspicios del productor Hal Roach; participaron en cortometrajes mudos, sonoros y largometrajes. La aparicin del sonoro conllev la desaparicin de muchos actores de la poca silente, Laurel y Hardy, sin embargo, tuvieron una relativamente fcil transicin al cine sonoro, con el corto Unaccustomed As We Are, en 1929. El acento ingls de Laurel y el acento sure?o de Hardy le dieron una nueva dimensin a sus personajes. La pareja demostr su capacidad para el humor verbal y visual, usando los dilogos para enfatizar, ms que para desplazar, su tipo de humor visual.    Los cortos de Laurel y Hardy, producidos por Hal Roach y estrenados por Metro Goldwyn Mayer, fueron producciones de mucho xito en la industria del cine de aquellos a?os. La mayora de los cortos eran de dos rollos (veinte minutos) pero hubo muchos de tres rollos e incluso uno, Beau Hunks, lleg hasta los cuatro rollos. En 1929 aparecieron por primera vez en un largometraje, en una de las escenas de Hollywood Revue of 1929. En 1930 apareceran por primera vez en color en La cancin de la estepa, donde hacan el papel de contrapunto cmico a una historia dramtica. La pelcula se considera como perdida, pues solo sobreviven algunos fragmentos y su banda sonora completa. En 1931 Laurel y Hardy hicieron su primer largometraje como protagonistas, Pardon Us. Dado el xito de la pelcula, la pareja decidi reducir el nmero de cortometrajes para concentrarse mas en la realizacin de largometrajes. En esta poca realizaran, entre otras, Pack Up Your Troubles en 1932 , Fra Diavolo (o The Devil's Brother), Sons of the Desert (Compa?eros de Juerga en espa?ol) en 1933, Babes in Toyland en 1934. Con el corto clsico The Music Box de 1932 ganaron el Oscar de la academia al mejor cortometraje de comedia.    A raz del sistema de presentar pelculas en programas dobles, Hal Roach decidi cancelar los cortometrajes de la pareja y dedicarse a hacer solo largometrajes. El ltimo cortometraje de la serie de Laurel y Hardy fue en 1935, Thicker than Water. Las siguientes pelculas ya entraran en la categora de largometrajes; las ms destacadas seran obras como Bonnie Scotland en 1935, The Bohemian Girly Our Relations, ambas de 1936, Way Out West (Laurel y Hardy en el Oeste)de 1937 (con la famosa cancin On the Trail of the Lonesome Pine), o Swiss Miss y Block-Heads, rodadas en 1938.  espero te agregue junto a mi devocin por estos grandes,  db|`|ecnygwiraa	Claro, me parecian muy interesantes :-)|`|359d0d710523608a8ca8f288b4b0822faa	me gustaban antes.....pero ya no las veo desde un monton de a?os|`|aFIibqbFaa	No...nunca|`|74kD6mhmaa	no me gustan!!!  bye!!|`|VHurEMmGaa	Pos caro que s.

It is wholly erroneous to suppose that faithfulness in doing one's daily work will insure the rewards of wealth. Barring the occasional and accidental acquirement of wealth, the material rewards of the temporal life are found to flow in certain well-organized channels, and only those who have access to these channels may expect to be well rewarded for their temporal efforts. Poverty must ever be the lot of all men who seek for wealth in isolated and individual channels. Wise planning, therefore, becomes the one thing essential to worldly prosperity. Success requires not only devotion to one's work but also that one should function as a part of some one of the channels of material wealth. If you are unwise, you can bestow a devoted life upon your generation without material reward; if you are an accidental beneficiary of the flow of wealth, you may roll in luxury even though you have done nothing worth while for your fellow men.|`|DfBH8Dr9aa	 No because there are ways to get money honestly and being honest will make you rich in your spirit.|`|9FQVdgnoaa	No, but poor people tend to be honest because they have nothing to protect, nothing to lose, nothing to hide.

Fools may jump into a well regardless but a person like this will jump in knowing the risk and taking it nonetheless.|`|ulsIrphnaa	umm no it all based upon how they are raised because u have ppl that are poor and lie and steal just as much as u do middle class and  upper class   |`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	That's the sole basis of credit.

A person who is honest in the big issues, but less honest in the smaller issues is still considered, I think, as an honest person. For example, if I said to my girlfriend after she got a horrible haircut, and in which she is emotionally distraught in how it unfortunately turned out: that she looks fine, beautiful etc. It is stretching the truth. Could I tell her, no you look horrible; with the idea of being "honest." Yes but I will no longer be considered someone who is being honest, but cruel, unthoughtful, unsupportive etc; true honesty along with other virtues, or qualities is, to my mind, primarily balanced- it does not go to one extreme nor to the other (i.e. someone who gets walked all over v.s.being curel- but balanced); it is constructive (even if it is a little exaggerated), and not deconstructive.|`|4V9dUkUmaa	Not necessirely, they might be not smart enough!

DRHvzDgyaa	We all feel trapped at some point in our lives because life can often be frustrating  when things do not go our way or we make mistakes.  We are always wondering what could have been if we had turned left instead of right.    I have felt this way for many years and have taken steps to gradually move in the direction that I am comfortable with.    It is not easy for others around you to accept this but nothing stays the same for ever.    First step: Evaluate why you are feeling trapped.    Second step: Decide on a course of action that will achieve happiness but take into account the effect it will have on your loved ones around you.  You may want to discuss with them how you feel and why it is necessary to change. They may even support you as they may be feeling the same.  Third step: Initiate change ... Don't look back and keep going.     You have not really given me enough detail in what has "trapped" you so I have had to generalize .  It is easy to feel helpless in these situations but in my experience it helps if you are constantly moving towards your goal, sooner or later you will achieve it.   Sometimes it is even better when the people you feel trapped with choose to follow and your goals are theirs.     It is possible but only you can make it happen    Keep your chin up.      |`|BLIGkqa0aa	I think my life is fantastic because through all the terrible situations i've been through there has always been people to rescue me from my enclosed box.

It is my thought that determinism is like a mattress you sleep on and your free will makes a dent. Over time it will make an impression that will say you are here and you are real. That does not mean that you control the universe but you are a universe of one and you are what you are and there is not force on earth that can change that fact if you do not allow it.

What is so special about those who are successful from those who are not- they bleed like everyone else, they cry like everyone else, they have insecurities like everyone else; they are human like everyone else...what separates them for those who have not? It is their drive; it comes from within. It is believing in yourself when not even your own family believes in you. It is hoping, and striving for something bigger than you even if you don't know if you will ever get there. It is giving everything you have to be the most knowledgeable, the best prepared, the most studied, and then some- to fulfill your dreams.

Probably a good movie MATRIX gives a nice example of that. A world has sort of encoded language where everything is perfectly defined, even the future. I always dreamed of a day when you could just look at things and see the meaning right away. Like know what feels like even dough you wouldn't have to touch it. Know how hot is the potato with out touching it, just see a number that would tell us. See what people think and even see a calculated possibility that would show what next they will think and do. In the end you we have this software in our mind, only PARTIALLY of course. Its not perfect and it works only on a  small scale. Your question clearly defines that everything is already preset to happen exactly in specific way. XD But if you don't know where to read the settings its hard to understand how this will be any good to us now. A very nice question dough.     From another point of view this has nothing to do with our existence because the world is received by us in a fragmented way.   The present, the past and the future.     Not to mention that we can actually see the future. People always that to see the future is impossible, but with the intelligence we have, humans can see bits of future and build  a kind of mosaic that will gives us a partial preview of the future.  |`|a6cDvPnqaa	only hypothetically |`|XC2qF9XUaa	Not to mention recursive.|`|0X6ZVBnWaa	Hypothetically speaking, 42.|`|tQbCQhDKaa	Everything would have a straight answer. 
I6dcRgD6aa	I am 50 but have most of my life I was depressed. I actually listened to this on CD but you can get the book if you like. It is from Abraham-Hicks "The Amazing Power Of Your Emotions". If you don't understand just e-mail me but remind me of your question so I can come back & re-mind myself of the whole story....this will change your life....I have been reading self-help books since I was 14 so I do have background & I am not sure if you can just pick right up on this or if background is needes so ask me if you need help...everyone can benefit if they learn about this...You will be fine.|`|fe8RxYsfaa	I read a lot of books on depression.  Just stand there in the bookstore and read a little bit of the book to decide if it has the right message for you.  A lot of them say "put your problems in God's hands" - well, bs - that isn't how I think, so those books weren't for me.  You have to read a little to know if the book is right for you.  Exercise helps with depression.  It has changed my life.   Try walking or riding a bike for an hour every day.  Good luck, hope things get better for you.|`|MSNVFxJjaa	Read anything by Ellen Hopkins. She is an amazing writer.  Her books are:  Crank  Glass  Impulse  Burned  and Identical    I suggest reading impulse first  it's about three kids who attempted  suicide and they are now  in a treatment center|`|jNKV10DLaa	Learned Optimism - by Martin Selgiman (past president of the APA)    FLOW - by Mihaly CsikSzentmihalyi (name might be off)|`|4ba9cacb930433ec3fc908ec85355a84aa	Because I also suffer from depression, I enjoyed The Bell Jar, by Sylvia Plath. She did eventually kill herself, but the book chronicles a part of youth when she thought she overcame a major depression episode. It's nice to be able to relate to her.    I also love the depression of high-school pragmatist Holden Caulfield in Catcher in the Rye. He's depressed but he's kind of indifferent about it, if that makes any sense.    Just to warn you, these are not about solutions. I find them helpful because I can relate to them, which may not be what you're looking for. If you do decide to read them, though, know that they are great books in their own right-- not just for the enjoyment of those of us with depression.    Good luck.|`|9ea5e8dd576fe0621bb8f8f8c17c8e7baa	Hi Tricia,     Its great to see you are helping yourself. The book I want to suggest you is a little deep but an AMAZING book. really. It's called   Feeling Good by dr.Burns and there is also a handbook by the same author. You might want to give it a try.  Read this short article about the book.   http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...|`|7ccc64759f9856c614b7c01a0e8ff351aa	i would see a counselor, and maybe they can recommend some good strategies |`|dYPsNJL9aa	Bible|`|JxAw7OTcaa	Yes I have read several books I loved that have helped me personally with depression.  I have also a wide range of materials I read for my job about mental health, and I would suggest looking for help from a resource center you may have in your area, that may even have trained counselors available to talk to for free.  Plus there are 1 800 numbers that are there to help people who are in crisis.  It depends upon where you are, or I would suggest more specific places- but look in your local phone book, where there is almost always a suicide prevention number on the front page.  You can also talk to your doctor about your symptoms of depression, and get a physical check up to know if the depression is caused by any physical factors.  I realize that you said you are already receiving help, however I wanted to cover some of these bases with you first.  Not only am I going to suggest resources to you, I am going to suggest ways for you to access your own inner resources or your ability to help yourself.  That is why they call them self help books- go browse through some in the book store and find what appeals to you.  It might sound kind of funny that I am going to suggest a book for you, called "The Artists Way" by Julia Cameron that is not even about depression at all,it is actually about developing your potential for creative living- which if you think about it, is the very opposite direction of depression. By using the resources in this book I have learned to connect with my self in a way that has led me to care better for myself, and discover hidden talents and abilities I didnt think I was good at before. It is a book about being an artist, which might not sound relevant if you are not an artist or dont think you would want to be, however at the start of the book, the author describes her belief that EVERYONE is creative.  Being a creative person does not always mean doing arts and crafts (which are actually very therapeutic and can help to process through the sometimes very complicated stuff we have inside of us) .  The book talks about creative living as a way of opening ourselves to joy, playfulness, and connection within ourselves and with others, living more consciously, and in line with our own values.  These, I think are foundational aspects to look at for discovering the reason why you feel depressed.    Whenever we look for stuff outside ourself to fill the emptiness and pain- whether through alcohol drugs, friends lovers, tv video games, work or anything like that, it is not going to be a solution with lasting value- and usually just leads to addiction to the thing we thought would help us, and disappointment with that, then driven deeper into depression.   For me, personally, this has meant a very thorough self examination of my values and beliefs about myself.  Very much like in the 12 steps programs for overcoming addictions, we make a fearless and complete values inventory, and make restitution where we have done wrong to others.  In our depressive states we can be very destructive towards others too.  Sometimes we have to come back to our true values, as we realize:" I cant stay in this abusive relationship anymore".  That is one example of what you might find from doing an inventory of yourself.  Sometimes these are actually the sources we find for why we are so angry at ourselves- because we have allowed abuse to happen to us, then make ourselves suffer again by blaming our self.  Let me explain it this way:  depression is anger that is turned inward against the self.  You need to learn to be assertive and to work on anger management in connection with depression.    To meaningfully address the depression and the roots of your self destructive behaviour, I would advise looking within to find you inner creative self as a  means reaching the potential in you that you are meant to live a good, healthy, and happy productive life- whatever those things may mean to you as you define them.  Hope this helps : )
8ekoa6szaa	1975.  I fell deeply in love for the first time in my life.    I am now a grandmother and the day my grandson was born WAS the most emotional time I've ever felt.  When my daughter placed him into my arms for the first time I felt something that I never had before.  It is indescribable.

They were the days before I first came in to Yahoo Answers, and before I saw the drivelling crap questions that most people ask.  Having said that, this isn't such a bad question. Not great, but not bad.  My teens were pretty good: they were in the '60s. I remember it, and I was there.  The past decade has seen some grief: this is inevitable as one gets older, but also there have been satisfying moments. I get a great deal of pleasure from my lectures. These are far more satisfying than they were in previous years. Are students getting more intelligent? I doubt it. Am I able to deal with their idiosyncracies better? Probably.  Many past days seem great, but they do seem to improve with the passage of years. Perhaps my memory of them is better than the reality.   I'd say NOW is the best time of my life, because I can savour each joyous moment, and try to ignore the not so good bits.

Long story short we found each other again, after we were both old enough that she couldn't do anything about us being together. We have wondered a lot about what would have happened if all that hadn't have split us apart back then.

Life Decryption Key  By Generalist 12-08     Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects. This document is intended for people who want to be responsible for their lives, and who accept that causes produce effects. Effects are produced by causes and  we have to make the right causes to get the effects we want. Those who want to control their lives rationally and responsibly, and accept that effects are produced by causes, please read on.    Instead of guiding ones life by the flurry of concepts, hopes, fears, and aphorisms we learn, it is more effective to conduct daily life while using a concise, accurate and short set of reality descriptions. We need a mental key to make the jumble understandable and make decisions more accurate and easier to enact.     The key exists. It is intended strictly to improve the conduct of daily life. It is a primer on how to improve the here and now. The future will be determined by how we deal with the present.     The question naturally occurs, What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?    Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. Think of brain, body, table, car clouds, air, soil, and on without limit. Yet, there is no mind without a brain. There is no car without thought. There is no wood for a table without the intangible life of a tree. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the words Myoho.      Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.    Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is.       The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing.     This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones. It was derived over thousands of years by brilliant people in India and China and finally used as the title of the Lotus Sutra in Kumarajivas translation of the Lotus Sutra. A 13th century Japanese monk named Nichiren recognized it for what it is and realized that anyone could guide their life better by using this key. He discovered the great treasure of life where anyone had access to it and dedicated his life to providing clarification and access.    The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focus the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.    Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way.

Un tema muy misterioso, es como resuelven los animales problemas que les causa su medio ambiente.  La especie de adapta y cambia geneticamente, es lo que decia Charles. Pero es muy misterioso el fenomeno, pareciera que es cierto lo que dice ademas Deeprak Chopra: el cuerpo tiene inteligencia (una inteligencia a nivel de las celulas, biologico, distinto del mental o racional).  Vos decime: como hacen las vivoras para fabricar venenos fuertisimos?, alli responderia bien Deeprak Ch.  Y la inteligencia racional de los animales, es tambien apreciable, pero poco interviene en estas "adaptaciones" que asombran a los mas grandes genios de la humanidad.

Pero por ej, con distintos experimentos que se hicieron, se demostro que una base de razonamiento tienen que tener los animales para poder llegar a la resolucion del oroblema.

Tienes razn en muchas de las cosas que escribes, pero creo que los animales, no todos, unicamente razonan por cuestiones de instinto y de conservacin; por ejemplo, las hormigas realizan esas proesas de ingenieria porque de lo contrario simplemente no sobreviven, lo mismo pasa con el uso de herramientas de los primates, (incluyendo al hombre). Mi apresiacin es de que, como dices, somos unicamente diferentes, somos animales a final de cuentas, animales que hemos evolucionado ms rapido que los otros y que por ello somos la raza dominante, pero te has puesto a pensar como sera este mundo si, por ejemplo, las abejas fueran mucho ms grandes que nosotros? o las hormigas? Creo que no seriamos la especie dominante.    Bueno... eso creo yo!|`|hfFWNDDcaa	pes si existe diferencia ya ue el razonar es algo natural en los seres humanos, en algunos  esta mas desarrollados que en  otros pero en fin es algo natural, en cambio la inteligencia se adquiere meiante la recopilacion de conocimientos por medio del estudio y aprendisaje....  en el caso de los seres humanos con respecto a los animales, ellos no razonan, no esta en su naturaleza.   en cambio si pueden ser inteligentes, ?por que no? si a veces hacen cosas sorprendentes, pero las hacen por ense?anza o imitacion...|`|kgnGgNHuaa	El raciocinio es detenerse y tratar de comprender las cosas, es estar fijamente contemplando una idea o tratando de resolver grandes problemas, la inteligencia, claro que todos somos inteligentes, ese t-o-d-o-s incluye a toda especie sobre la tierra, la inteligencia es resultado de situaciones, actos que nos hacen comprender qu debemos y qu no, segn el estado emocional: un drogadicto podra resolver un problema de algebra pero no deja el vicio, es decir, el es inteligente, pero no tiene reciocinio. Un animal, sabe que si hurta la comida del amo, recibir un golpe, pero si este no est cerca lo hara, es decir, tiene la inteligencia de no acercarse, pero no razona que si lo hace, aunque no lo vean, siempre recibir el golpe.

Congratulations and good luck!|`|T5xhG9vhaa	I'm not really familiar with the role, but here are some general things to try:    1.  Read the play several times.  The first time, just focus on the general plot, store, etc.  Subsequent times focus on Nancy.  When she's on stage ask yourself "what is she thinking?"  "Why is she saying/doing what she's doing?"  When she's not onstage, ask yourself "where is Nancy while this is going on?"  "How would she feel about what is happening right now?"    2.  Do some research on her context.  You probably will want to read Dickens' "Oliver Twist," which your play was based on.  Read about what London was like in that time period.  Think about where/how she probably grew up.  What socioeconomic class does she belong to?  Who are the important figures in her life?  What kinds of things does she eat and drink?  What would she have worn?  What are her daily routines like?  What sorts of things would she have been scared of in that world?  Hopeful for?    3. Use your imagination.  Your life is probably very little like Nancy's, but think about what you have in common with her.  Think about how Nancy would react in situations you find yourself in.  How is that similar/different from what you would do?  The goal is to bring this person to life in your imagination.  Tell yourself stories about Nancy that aren't in the play or book based on what else you know about her.    4. During rehearsal:  Every time Nancy enters or exits the stage think about where she was coming from or where she is going.  Build a complete story for what Nancy is doing during time span of the play in your head.  Pay close attention to every direction for her.  Think about what she says and does that is strange to you.  What are her idiosyncrasies, the little things that make her uniquely herself.  What tics, habits, weaknesses, strengths, desires does she have?    If this sounds like a lot of work, it is.  The payoff is having a perfectly clear sense of who this person is so you can portray her as a self-consistent person making real choices.      Also: You'll probably also have to do a lot of voice/dialect work on this show.  If everything's going to be in period dialect, get yourself some tapes and start working on them now!

He started wars with various nations to acquire lands, create German nationalism.|`|RIwGbafvaa	The largest factor was the Prime Minister of Prussia, Otto von Bismarck. His hard-nosed tactics, known as realpolitik, got him to be the head of Prussia. He then manuevered to annex other, weaker German states.

He took advantage of Napoleon III's weakness and unified the country in one foul swoop, taking Alsace-Lorraine in the process.

Or do you mean whan Otto Von Bismark unified Germany in the 19th century?  3.  Or do you mean when East and West Germany was formed once the communists took over East Germany?  4.

Things will look up as long as you keep living. The story you had at the end reminded me of something I had gone through a year ago; just like you I wrote a poem about it.

Lo que yo entiendo como magia blanca es la que todos conocemos, la que sale en la TV o vemos en las fiestas infantiles, que son trucos o ilusiones opticas, esa desde luego que existe.   La magia negra esa ya es otra cosa. Como tal no existe, no existe aquello de que tengas que conseguir una infinidad de ingredientes y posimas para obtener algo en concreto, todo eso de los ingredientes son placebos para crear una f desmedida y tengas confianza en que algo va a suceder cuando juntes todos los ingredientes y realizes el procedimiento que el "mago, hechicero, brujo, chaman" o como se llame, te indique. Es cuestin de f.

Leadership to me means being able to direct people to do the management, to deligate to others what needs to be done and having them follow through as you require them to. It means being first and having those that are behind you supply you with all the information you ask for to lead the company ot whatever orginization it is, in the right direction.

This is where most mangers and then their companies run into trouble.  Managers should have long term improvements always in their sights and this means knowing what stops his staff from giving their best. From this basis, and after the necessary in house improvement, he can bring into play his own improving ideas.  Leadership come from him downwards where he trains or coerces his second line to back their workers in implementing the agreed and discussed plan.  In all of this a good manager will spend at least 25% of his day with his staff and at their desk or on the floor learning from them talking to them and acting as their champion.  He should never give an order to anyone and direct only those directly below his level.  Above him he must stand firm against his own boss where he sees his demands are not in line with the company's best interest.

But, knowing the danger that nazism represented, they knew that had to unit if they wanted to defeat Hilter. Churchill said, to explain why he was supporting Staline : "If Hitler would attack Evil, I'll help Satan". This phrase shows why this two ideologies fought nazism together. This alliance was effective until the beginning of the year 1945. At this time, the Allied knew they were going to win (it was only a question of months). At this point, the difference between USA and USSR cam back, and they tried to get the best part of the victory. In order to not make the USSR angry, the Allied let the Red Army conquer Berlin, the symbol of the war against nazism.  But, when the war ended, the Cold War almost began. The first example of the Cold War is the blocade of Berlin by the Red Army. During 11 months, the USAAF supplied by air the German capital, knowing that the Russian Air Force wouldn't try to fight directly the USAAF.|`|ab0a26827eaea196848f50f6300a0c22aa	Berlin and the splitting of Germany.

The USSR was just as bad as germany, before Germany decided to void their treaty with Russia(in which they said they wouldn't attck each other), Russia was invading eastern Europe and also had a pact w/Germany in which they both invaded Poland, and in essence split the country in half.

The Soviets wanted to spread communism thoughout Europe (including the Allied countries) while the Western Allies wanted open markets and access to the Soviet resources.

After the rebellion of Belgian peasants (1789-1790), Austrian couldn't win back its influence on this province, which was invaded and finally annexed by France in 1794. After the defeat of Napoleon in Waterloo, Europe was re-designed at the Congress of Vienna (1815).

So I agree with many others.    Belgium has never been a part of France.      If you want more details ...    It began in 843, the Treaty of Verdun.  The Empire of Charlemagne / Karl der Groose (I don't know the name in english) was divided between his three grandson : Francia Orientalis (Germany), Francia Occidentalis (more or less France) and Francia Media (from the Netherlands to Italy).  Most of the territories of Belgium were in the Francia Media, the exception was Flandria (Brugge, Rijsel/Lille and Gent) who belong to France.  But Flandria remained very reluctant to obey the french king.  During the "100 years war", they helped and prefered the english.    All the territories of current Belgium (and many others) were gathered in the 15th century by the duke of Bourgogne, who tried to create a new kingdom (a new Lotharingia). By heritage, they came to "Charles Quint" (Charles the 5th) of Habsburg, king of Spain, of the "New World", duke of Milan, german emperor, and so on.  The so-called "Spanish Netherlands" (that was the name of Belgium at this time) stayed in the possession of Spain after the rebellion of Holland and other protestants territories. There was an exception : the bishop of Lige was prince of an independant country from 879.  After the war of succession of Spain (1713), the Netherlands were given  the austrian Habsburg, german emperors: they became the "Austrian Netherlands".  In 1789, there was a revolution against the centralisation of emperor Joseph II and the country became independant : "les tats belgiques unis" (the "united belgian states", belgique was still and adjective).  After a counter revolution, we were invided by France and the Campo Formio treaty (1795) gave us (and Lige) to France : we were departements (counties) like others.  In 1815, the big nations (England, Pruss, Russia aund Austria) united us  (and Luxembourg) to Holland and we became the "kingdom of Netherlands".  In 1830, there was the revolution and independance.    So, Belgium was part of France from 1795 to 1815 ans it was not very popular.  In the former centuries we had been invided several times by France but also by Holland, England, Pruss.    I've to say that our princes (dukes, counts, ...) and the people who made business were in touch with France.  French was a common language in the aristocracy and bourgeoisie from the middle ages.  But Belgium war (nearly) never part of France.

I learned to save jars large enough to hold fruit salad for a whole grieving household, to cube home-canned pears and peaches, to slice through maroon grape skins and flick out the sexual seeds with a knife point.   I learned to attend viewing even if I didn't know the deceased, to press the moist hands of the living, to look in their eyes and offer sympathy, as though I understood loss even then.   I learned that whatever we say means nothing, what anyone will remember is that we came.   I learned to believe I had the power to ease awful pains materially like an angel.   Like a doctor, I learned to create  from another's suffering my own usefulness, and once you know how to do this, you can never refuse.

Hence, all you need to know is what quidd is.|`|AA10704364	This may be 'poetic license'.      Quidity is the essence of a thing, what makes a thing what it is.      So Quidify would mean the essence of April, what makes April what it is.|`|3078cd70f433dfb3bb90750ecbb76adbaa	The closest word I know to quiddify is quiddity.  It means the nature of the thing - the essence of a thing.
521ca8fedd882e468f9b672b13601025aa	At the beginning of the book, he is a sweet, carefree youth, who knows little about the world and the evils in it. Then, thanks to the influence of Lord Henry, he wishes that his portrait will age and he never will. As the years progress, Dorian becomes a selfish, cruel man, as he displays with his treatment towards Sybil. The tragedy with Sybil haunts Dorian, and soon he becomes a blackmailing murderer. Eventually, his own evil deeds haunt him, and towards the end of the book he begins to try to change the man that he has become, and he tries to do good and right. But it's harder than he imagined with his portrait mocking him. At the end he has gone insane, and become a vulnerable, terrified man.|`|56cc728068d45faa0a5559df343ce8eaaa	It was a picture, wasn't it?

I think that Dorian was innocent in the beginning of the novel but he allowed himself to be influenced by Lord Henry. Thereafter he became obsessed with sin and anything associated with it. The yellow book also seemed to kind of possess him. He was vain and all he cared about were his youth and beauty. It was in search of these things that he looked for adventure. He wanted to remain young and beautiful forever and not just have a fleeting memory of his beauty in his picture. I believe that his vanity was his downfall. It was sad to see a character like Dorian fall. His one tragic flaw led him to his tragic end. It would have been prevented but unfortunately the road that Dorian's life took was his own choice so therefore though there were many influences it was his choice to lead the life he led and to commit the sins he did.|`|SOPRt0Ffaa	Dorian Gray's personality was evil masked by charm. He was like a vampire living off the innocence of his victims. People only saw the surface beauty, not the ugly reality.

17orTrcRaa	Does the library have a computerized check out system?  If they do, then there is no way that you can prove anything different than what the electronic stamp says.  I worked in a library, and people were always 100% sure that they had checked a book in on time, or didn't still have any overdue books.  They would remember precisely putting it in the bookdrop.  But then, a few days later, they would find it at home.  They remembered wrong.

293043c63caf622d1f2e5187b83de931aa	Trs franchement, malgr des performances impressionnantes et des tenues superbes, je n'accroche pas du tout  la rigidit ... presque robotique, de cette discipline. Rigidit qui a t institue par l'interprtation et la codification anglo-saxonne de nombreuses danses pourtant  l'origine si sensuelles ! ...   La raideur comme les pas exagrs se prtent parfaitement  la valse (viennoise notamment), http://www.tanzsport.ch/data/default/Doc... , http://www.tbdc-andenne.be/fsvalsevien.h... , http://show54.chez-alice.fr/Show54_52_.h... ainsi qu'aux varits de danses 'purement' anglo-saxonnes : rock, quick-step, madison, fox-trot, etc.,  la rigueur le paso-doble, ...   Mais absolument pas  la salsa, au mambo,  la rumba, au tango (argentin, je prcise), et autres danses latinos (hormis peut-tre le cha-cha-cha) !!!  Pour moi, ?a, non, avec un dhanch aussi saccad/cass, ce n'est pas de la salsa http://www.danse-germain.com/images/pres...    C'est du sport, ?a oui, sans conteste ! ... mais de l'art, dj beaucoup moins pour moi, mme si ces dernires annes ont vu poindre un certain assouplissement avec l'intgration de nouvelles danses latinos (salsa cubaine et/ou portoricaine, bachata, ... voire des bribes plus ou moins perceptibles de flamenco.   Ainsi les danseurs commencent  prendre, dans ces danses-ci, des liberts avec le style impos,  outrepasser les codes, librer et fluidifier les mouvements et le corps, ... et probablement je pense ... encore plus de plaisir  ! ...    videmment, ?a reste arbitraire ; cependant, on ne peut nier qu'une codification trs rigide a t opre par les anglo-saxons (les Anglais plus prcisment) !    Moi qui ai pas mal pratiqu le flamenco, la danse orientale, et un peu de tango argentin, de salsa ... je ne suis vraiment fascine, transcende que devant les versions (interprtations) originales de ces danses !  Mais les go?ts et les couleurs !!! ...|`|47b2d14d548d4be4181cb23983150a06aa	Si c'est que je crois (rock saut endiabls avec des salto) Je le trouve trop proche de la gymnastique. Elle reflte un manque de crativit dans le mouvement (idem pour le patinage artistique) mais un niveau athltique et sportif impressionnant.  Quand on fait d'accoler sportive  danse, cela signifierait-il que la danse contemporaine ou le hip hop ou le classique ne sont pas sportifs ?  En fait, je ragis un peu avec mes tripes l mes j'aime beaucoup la danse en gnral et si j'avais le temps et l'argent, en plus de faire du contemporain, de la salsa et du modern'jazz, je ferais du flamenco, de la danse orientale, du hip hop, du classique, du tango ....|`|2ee49ea2de8ac65f65f3205e2db8ad7eaa	les danses de couples en concours? j'aime bien mais ce n'est pas ma tasse de th.

Moi qui ne suis pas une sportive acharne, si je revenais au monde, c'est ce sport l que je pratiquerais. Et pourtant, il en faut des heures d'entraiment et de la sueur. Mais avec de la musique, cela passe inaper?u.  Alors, dansez maintenant...............|`|9OBMh2xHaa	C'est beau pour l'harmonie des corps et la sensualit qui s'en dgage je trouve. Les pas de deux de danse classique sont toujours magnifiques mais les expressions parfois trop figes, mme dans les pas les plus vifs ; tandis que le c?t "sauvage" de la danse sportive rend un effet plus naturel. Je trouve nanmoins dommage qu'on aie pu apposer l'adjectif "sportive"  de la danse... le fait qu'il s'agisse de comptition nuit un peu  la spontanit de la danse  mon avis - videmment il s'agit d'impressionner, donc on sacrifie la grace au spectaculaire - mais cela reste stimulant et entra?nant.  Depuis que j'ai vu le film "Shall we dance" je ne pense plus qu' essayer... lol - c'est vrai que les costumes font rver, mais avant la comptition je pense surtout  la complicit avec son partenaire. La valse et le tango sont sans doute trs techniques mais ce doit tre un pur bonheur  pratiquer lorsqu'on s'y sent un peu  l'aise, et je trouve dommage qu'ils soient rservs  des comptitions encadres au lieu d'tre enseigns et pratiqus par tous comme c'tait le cas avant.    Lula, pte prcision : pour l'adjectif "sportive", ce n'est pas que la danse n'est pas physique, bien au contraire, c'est juste que je prfre la considrer comme un art que comme un sport. Le but principal dans la danse est de crer, de provoquer des sentiments, de l'harmonie etc., et pas simplement une performance physique. La performance n'est qu'un moyen. Et mme s'il s'agit de comptition, on ne peut pas juger de la graciosit d'un mouvement au mme titre que de la hauteur d'un saut, c'est bien plus subjectif.|`|zDFhoeV7aa	je trouve ?a hyper impressionnant, les danseurs font des figures poustouflantes!

wLs8C3lCaa	La nada es eso, nada, pero al mismo tiempo es todo porque es "posibilidad de ser". Para Parmnides "el ser es lo que es y no puede no-ser". El ser es y el no-ser no es y de all no puede salir "nada". Sin embargo, para otros filsofos la nada es posibilidad de ser, porque el ser es cambio y movimiento. El ser al mismo tiempo que es tambin "es nada" porque de lo contrario no podra ser, porque el ser es "sentido", es decir: cambia y se mueve, y no podramos explicarnos el cambio y el movimiento sin lo opuesto al ser. Vamos: un da algo es y otro da es otra cosa, un da la semilla es semilla y al otro da rbol, un da yo soy ni?o y al otro da soy joven. Soy ni?o pero puedo ser joven, y ser joven implica la negacin de ser ni?o.

QYPrM3GPaa	You will never learn everything, but you do already know everything.  Our souls have access to all knowledge called the Akashic Records.  you can access these records if you study the escoteric arts like metaphysics and learn how to use your mind and connect with your soul.    The good news is, that learning and growing never stops.  When you reach one level of understanding, another level pops up in front of you and makes itself present.  This is because God designed the universe this way...nobody wants to know absolutely everything...not EVERYTHING!  If you did, you would be bored.    Remember "Q" from Star Trek: The Next Generation?  Q was a group of super advanced beings that knew absolutely everything.  They were dead bored with knowing everything and nothing new to challenge them or do or learn or experience.  That is why "Q" stepped outside the "Q," to act like God and drive Captain Picard nuts...sort of anyway, LOL.    Your desire to know everything is the basis of all desire itself, it is your closest contact with God, who, God also, wants to know everything...so much so, God lives through all of us, learning day by day as life proceeds forward and we experiment and decide and choose.  This is what makes life worth living.

As you know, man's intellect is rather limited, how can your mind hold the concept of Eternity and Infinity? The mind is unable to grasp it in total.     So the first step in your quest is to quieten the mind and the physical senses, and then get acquainted with your soul, your world within. "Mind, Be Still and Know that 'I AM' God." How many times we are looking to the sky to find God and Wisdom, and yet we are told that He is nearer than hands and feet, as the poet says. "Behold the Kingdom of God is within you."

It is only necessary to let go of the limitations we place on ourselves and of the love for  agendas imposed by social systems that want to keep you useful for their specific agendas. If you have courage and curiosity, use the life decryption key to open the path you want. Since all life is a vast web that includes all of the universe, there is no part that is separate from you.  Instead of guiding your life by the flurry of concepts, hopes, fears, and aphorisms we learn, it is more effective to use a concise, accurate and short set of reality descriptions. A key to decrypt the entire jumble and make decisions more accurate and easier is what we need.    Three increasingly familiar words Myoho, Renge and Kyo fill that need  .  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life; think of brain, body, table, car clouds, air, soil, and on without limit. Yet,  there is no mind without a brain. There is no car without thought. There is no wood for a table without the life of a tree. There is no action without potential. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in Myoho.    Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.    Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memory and on and on. They are all summed up in the word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is.    The list of words and concepts that pertain to tangible and intangible, to causes and effects and to change can be endless and inefficient to use.    The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing. This is pragmatically observable by anyone.     It was derived over thousands of years by brilliant people in India and China. A monk named Nichiren recognized it for what it is and realized that anyone could guide their life better by using this key.  The people, who win most consistently, are the ones who use this formulation with focused intention as a decryption key to clearly see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones. The way to do that is to add the shortened Sanskrit word for focused intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle. It releases delusions and limitations like vitamin C cures scurvy.    Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the key. Some want to bake a perfect souffl. Others want to create a peaceful planet or just get along with their partner. Others might want to develop the capabilities of their consciousness to levels beyond the ordinary. It is all available.

Solar energy is the light and radiant heat from the Sun that influences Earth's climate and weather and sustains life. Solar power is the rate of solar energy at a point in time; it is sometimes used as a synonym for solar energy or more specifically to refer to electricity generated from solar radiation. Since ancient times solar energy has been harnessed for human use through a range of technologies. Solar radiation along with secondary solar resources such as wind and wave power, hydroelectricity and biomass account for most of the available flow of renewable energy on Earth.    Solar energy technologies can provide electrical generation by heat engine or photovoltaic means, daylighting and space heating in passive solar and active solar buildings, potable water via distillation and disinfection, hot water, space cooling by absorption or vapor-compression refrigeration, thermal energy for cooking, and high temperature process heat for industrial purposes.    2 Applications of solar energy technology      * 2.1 Architecture and urban planning      * 2.2 Agriculture and horticulture      * 2.3 Solar lighting      * 2.4 Solar thermal            o 2.4.1 Water heating            o 2.4.2 Heating, cooling and ventilation            o 2.4.3 Water treatment            o 2.4.4 Cooking            o 2.4.5 Process heat

If you are in Church, then there needs to be someone who can interpret the prayer so that every one can learn.  If no one is present that can understand, then the prayer is just so much gibberish.      It also needs to be controlled and done in order, not interrupting the sermon or teaching that may be occurring.  If these conditions cannot be met, then the praying in tongues is not from God, but rather from some person desiring to appear more spiritual than he or she is.    All this is spelled out in 1 Corinthians 14.|`|zTFjO4f9aa	My childhood vicar (a greek scholar and lecturer at the UK's main theological college) believes that the phrase 'speaking in tongues' is mistranslated from the original text, and that the gospels simply meant to say that the disciples spread the word in different languages around the region.

Early in the Christian congregation, copies of the Scriptures were few. Usually, only the rich possessed scrolls or books of any sort. In pagan lands, there was no knowledge of the Bible or of its Author, Jehovah. Christian teaching had to be conveyed by word of mouth. The miraculous gifts were useful in showing that God was using the Christian congregation.    But Paul explained that these gifts would pass away once they were no longer needed. Whether there are gifts of prophesying, they will be done away with; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will be done away with. For we have partial knowledge and we prophesy partially; but when that which is complete arrives, that which is partial will be done away with.1 Corinthians 13:8-10.

n9Wu1Omxaa	Well first, let me start off by saying PLEASE do not take the advice from the person under me. Do not just chose any random monologue from your show or favorite movie. You have to chose something from the same time period as the show you are auditioning for. If i was auditioning for Sweeney Todd I wouldn't use a monologue from the Sound of Music, lol. But to answer your question, im not exactly sure an exact monolouge to use for you. But i can tell you this,    Grace: Something sophisticated and elegant that shows some love in it.    Hannigan: Something mean and showing anger and possibly loss and/or  sadness. Something from "Mommy Dearest" would be a good choice.     MAKE SURE: You chose a monologue that shows your acting skills and  how you portray the character. Be sure to make the character your own, and make sure you show the auditors something original and something they can remeber.|`|F0d1bOxgaa	Try something from your favorite movie or play.

He led two resistance movements against the Canadian government and its first post-Confederation Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald. Riel sought to preserve Mtis rights and culture as their homelands in the Northwest came progressively under the Canadian sphere of influence.

nbavqswSaa	First of all, if you truly know that you can be whatever character you are portraying, then well done. That's a big part to the performance. However, you must remember, that it is not you who is kissing him, but your character kissing "the love of her life". If you do not feel comfortable, or you may not be as "smooth" as he is (as you so put), then you must take mental notes from this girl that you share the part. This sounds a bit weird, but when you are out and about, and you see a couple, without making it too obvious, study their body language and try to subtly copy it on stage. If you immerse yourself in the character, it won't even feel as if you are kissing this other guy.     Also, if there's a film version of this musical, watch the chemistry between the two leads over and over again, and try to steal some pointers!     If by the end of all that, you still feel uncomfortable, I think that you should take the male lead aside, and suggest to practice the kissing scene before hand.       I hope that helped, and you totally don't have to do the last one, that can be like a last resort thing!|`|Z3RFbUrDaa	he's the male lead, right? he's probably just ACTING ;) like it's not a big deal. it's a big deal for anyone. just remember, you're in the play for a reason. you can do it! :)|`|1cef74a6cce2ab514140c9166dfc4620aa	you have to totally be in character and let go. is this something professional? how old are you? anyway its tough to say but that's why its called acting haha ... if you really need help i would consult the director or someone local that teaches an acting class. which musical? ... your welcome to e-mail me the answers to my questions... i might be able to help more. :)|`|Ly2tIgUKaa	just go with the flow and see what happens and put it this way: he's probably just as nervous or even more than you!|`|Ani4lchaaa	lol i know how u feel i did a play with a guy who always had bad breath and we had to kiss. it was horrible. just imagine him as some one else that u would luv to date thats what i did, and  i was sucsesful.
AA11898755	ABSOLUTELY! Also, you may want to consider placing a "watermark" over the  images stored on CD so they cannot be dl'd & copied without a release from you.   Your work is only valuable if you treat as such. It is automatically covered by copyright, but you as artist must be able to prove that YOU own the copyright by offerring documentation before the fact. In other words...after the image has been misused its too late to whip up some proof you own the CR and will be exponentially more difficult to prove.. A potential client will perceive you to be a professional and will be less likely to attempt to take advantage. It happens.

Kv1piuafaa	Put pieces in your portfolio that show your versatility in lots of different mediums.  I knew a guy who drew nothing but deer: oils of deer, pastels of deer, sculptures of deer.  He was skilled in the mediums, but didn't show creativity.  Copying the masters is okay as long as that's not ALL you're doing.  Drawing a portrait or a still life is original, that's not copying.  If you want to expand your imagination keep a sketch journal and draw your entries instead of writing them.      Read books by Lynda Barry, she's an excellent inspiration!|`|44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	OK, you are the victim of safe teaching that has allowed you to see copying as art. It isn't. They will want to see original work drawn from life. You have to show your own work, not a pastiche of someone else's. Original works - self portraits, still life, etc are excellent. But you have to have a reason for everything in your portfolio. How can you explain your work? What are you trying to express - technique or personal taste? What is your philosophy? Where do you want to go with your work? If you don't have answers to questions like these then they will see straight through you. You need skills and substance. Good Luck.|`|DSp8azw7aa	Why not try a paint by numbers and see if you can get away with it.|`|fedecac5f8ffc0aef576423b6fcf4422aa	It depends on what major you're interested in. Illustration? Fine Art? Something in design? Most art schools want to see a portfolio that is focused on the major the person is applying for. I would discuss it with one of your art teachers. They can give you a surprising amount of info, and help you focus your portfolio. They might be even willing to look over the art you have and tell you what are your strongest pieces. =)

Because of him I have faith in myself to make things possible.  I trust God because I know he has a plan for me & What happens, he has control over.  He won't give me something I can't handle.     "Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding" (Proverbs 3:5)  Furthermore, it tells us that "He who trusts in himself is a fool. . ." (Proverbs 28:26).     In order to trust in God, you must totally surrender your will, your ideas, your desires, and your future in to God's hands. Many of us are "control freaks." We don't want to give the control of any part of our lives over to another. If you don't believe that God loves you fully and really does have your best interests at heart and desires the very best for you, trusting Him is going to be extremely difficult. It takes a very special relationship to allow that measure of surrender. Most of us have a tendency to claim trust in God. However, at the first sign of any difficulty or trial, we think that God must not love us because He is allowing this difficulty to happen. The trial is exactly what God is using to test the level of trust that we have in Him.     We can trust in many things. None, however, offer the protection plan, the long term security, or the benefits that trusting in God offers. All of the other things in which we place our trust can fail. God never fails! In the words of King David, ". . .Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the LORD God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you or forsake you. . ." (1 Chronicles 28:20).

yOK32PM9aa	Yes, I have had this, and I have read that it is common.  I think it is due to the way we perceive situations.  We have all got certain issues that we think about a lot, and this makes us see things in that particular way.  To give some really crude examples, an angry person will often get offended and get into fights because they are looking for offence.  A romantic person might get more dates because they are always looking for the signs of love.  If they are really serious problems for you, then talking it through with someone you trust, or maybe a cousellor, might help.  Once you work out that it is only because you are seeing the world in a particular way, you can learn to see things differently and avoid the pitfalls.  Check this out:    http://www.ambafrance-do.org/stress-mana...    it says something similar.  Good luck!|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G What it means is that you are human and deal with individual situations rather than examining your susceptibility. Until you honestly reflect on what you might be doing to contribute to the problem, and in what way are these situations reflections of your own thoughts, words and deeds, the patterns will repeat. If you want to break the chain, use the LDK.  Life Decryption Key  By Generalist 12-08     Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects. This document is intended for people who want to be responsible for their lives, and who accept that causes produce effects. Effects are produced by causes and  we have to make the right causes to get the effects we want. Those who want to control their lives rationally and responsibly, and accept that effects are produced by causes, please read on.    Instead of guiding ones life by the flurry of concepts, hopes, fears, and aphorisms we learn, it is more effective to conduct daily life while using a concise, accurate and short set of reality descriptions. We need a mental key to make the jumble understandable and make decisions more accurate and easier to enact.     The key exists. It is intended strictly to improve the conduct of daily life. It is a primer on how to improve the here and now. The future will be determined by how we deal with the present.     The question naturally occurs, What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?    Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. Think of brain, body, table, car clouds, air, soil, and on without limit. Yet, there is no mind without a brain. There is no car without thought. There is no wood for a table without the intangible life of a tree. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the words Myoho.      Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.    Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is.       The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing.     This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones. It was derived over thousands of years by brilliant people in India and China and finally used as the title of the Lotus Sutra in Kumarajivas translation of the Lotus Sutra. A 13th century Japanese monk named Nichiren recognized it for what it is and realized that anyone could guide their life better by using this key. He discovered the great treasure of life where anyone had access to it and dedicated his life to providing clarification and access.    The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focus the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.    Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.  For more detailed information see   http://www.sgi-usa.org. Or  http://www.SGI.org    Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key. That term is my attempt to summarize the essence of the philosophy taught by SGI.|`|W5JjCD9gaa	It means that you are a perfectly normal human being who draws associations between each event that occurs in your life. Stop worrying, everything happens for a reason; it's just that sometimes the reason is clouded by your doubts and worries. The longer you worry about the problems, the longer it'll take you to realise why they are happening.     Be happy and relax.    All the best.

I grew up in a small town in TN.  I planned on working in a medical profession, having a family and living on a farm with horses and lots of other animals.    Now, I am 52.  I worked as a Clinical Laboratory Scientist for 20 years.  Now, I live in a condo in San Diego, CA.  with my dogs and birds.  I am divorced and had to take a disability retirement because of migraine headaches.  I was married for 4 1/2 years and had a child, but ended up divorced and never chose to remarry.  Five years ago, I started a business selling Bird Diapers on the internet. It has worked out well.    Never in a million years would I have thought of living in CA or owning a business.  When I was younger, I liked to party quite a bit.  Now, I enjoy spending a large amount of time doing volunteer work and finding ways to help others.    I find that I have become less focused on my own problems over the years.  Things that used to seem very import, now often seem unimportant and frivolous.  With time, things in life seem to take on a very different perspective.  At least, this has been true for me.    Thanks for asking.|`|GkH5NoFyaa	Great question and interesting observations.    Yes, my life is almost EXACTLY what I wanted. At age 13 I started writing down what I wanted to do with my life, added things, took away things, as I grew older. Now I am approaching 60, things are starting to get a little bit murky. I mean; do I retire at 62, or 65, or 66, the legal age for retirement, or work to age 70 - then retire. I will get $5,000 more a year if I work until age 70, etc. etc. Or even keep working as long as I can? I mean, my job is great. And I am in great physical shape (23 years of weightlifting). And it goes on and on. The more we learn, the more choices we have.     sigh....    I BELIEVE I will be alive for a very long time, and in good physical and mental shape. But others around me "warn" me about not retiring at 65, and then having a short retirement life, or worse, getting bad sick and spending my retirement in bed. Damn. Makes you crazy worrying about these things.|`|qdlmy4l8aa	Not at all. I never thought I'd grow up to be a schmuck.|`|yCT7Cnaoaa	I would have never thought my life would have turned out like it has.

AE2iQVKRaa	I guess you mean the Trajan Wall. (Troy is an ancient city in Turkey).  Contrary to the name and popular belief, the ramparts were not built by Romans during Trajan's reign.    There are three walls or valla in Romania, in south-central Dobruja, extending from the Danube to the Black Sea coast, built most probably by Byzantines between the 10th and the 11th century, during the reign of John I Tzimisces and Basil II, to protect the empire against the Russians and Bulgarians.    The oldest and smallest vallum, the little earth wall, is 61 km in length, extending from Cetatea P?tulului on the Danube to Constan?a on the sea coast. Entirely made of earth, it has no defensive constructions built on it, but has a moat on its southern side.    The second vallum, the large earth wall, 54 km in length, overlaps the smaller one on some sections. It begins on the Danube, follows the Carasu Valley and ends at Palas, west of Constan?a. Its average height is 3.5 m, and it has moats on both sides. On it are built 63 fortifications: 35 larger (castra), and 28 smaller (castella). The average distance between fortifications is 1 km. Built during John Tzimisces's reign and destroyed by migratory population, it was reconstructed at a later time.    The last vallum to be built, the stone wall, is also made of earth, but has a stone wall on its crest. It has 59 km in length, extending from south of Axiopolis to the Black Sea coast, at a point 75 m south of the little earth wall. The agger is about 1.5 m in height, while the stone wall on top has an average height of 2 m. It has a moat on its northern side and 26 fortifications, the distance between them varying from 1 to 4 km.    The commune Valu lui Traian (formerly Hasancea) is named after the vallum.
pvJAp3vIaa	Wow, that's a pretty broad question, and the answer will depend on who you ask.    The Empire had gotten large and difficult to manage.  As hard as it can be to manage a nation like the United States today, imagine doing so with communications taking weeks, maybe months, to travel to the outlying edges of the empire.  Added to that was the complacency of the leadership and central population.  They expected a lot and weren't willing to work as hard for it.  Added to that you have outside attack from Mongols, Goths, Visigoths, Vandals, and others.  The end result was a nation that fractured.  When Rome itself fell, the keystone of the empire was lost and those regions that were, essentially, self-governing ended up going their separate ways instead of banding together.    As for a main reason... pick one... there's really no "main" reason to be had.|`|eoDWzUNxaa	The Roman Empire fell apart because it was too big and hard to control. The emperor Diocletian (not sure on spelling) divided the empire into two parts, west and east. The Roman empire fell apart when barbarians attacked the western side.

I grew up on a farm (though being in the country doesn't mean you have to be a farmer), and to me there's nothing like walking out around the hillside and seeing the beauty of nature in all its astounding glory.  Sounds corny, but it's true.  Plus, I'm only about 15 minutes from town, so I still am able to work and be a "productive" member of society for 8 hours a day.    Though the farm is full of family that I don't get along with now, and peace is harder to come by these days, I still feel a connection to nature, and wouldn't trade living in the country for anything in the world.

When we guess at a fact, then certainly we can be shown to be right or wrong by the actuality of the fact coming up.  We can look the information up, or go weight it or whatever.    Assessing another person's character is a complicated thing.  Most people would agree on the characteristics that make up a "good" person in the context.  Then still some people would argue the validity of those traits.  Next, we all have our idea about what traits the guy has, and who know - and finally, there's the traits the guy actually has.

T1j7dsZfaa	Its not actually known but recently archaeologists found an ruins of a city that might have been Troy.|`|gxRhJfL7aa	It seems that Troy existed and was sacked, destroyed and rebuilt about three times. Homer did created the history of Troy on basis of a true happening, what he did was introduce some legends introducing Greek gods in the fighting and exalting the deeds of some kings and generals to make his verses more exiting and interesting to listen, arousing the patriotism of people as it was so needed for the constant danger of the Greek cities been attacked by the huge Persian Armies.  As the Trojan horse was made from wood from the disable ships, there is not remaining proof of its existence, but it sounds logic and convenient to make it part of the show, because supposedly Troy was impenetrable and also to emphasis the brightness of Odysseus for he was the motive of other of his histories, The Odyssey.  The Trojan Horse is also the preamble of another of the heroic Greek story about another Greek hero, Aeneas noble in the court of king Priamus of Troy who fled the city before the destruction with a group of trojans reaching Italy and became the ancestors of Romulus and Remus the founders of Rome.|`|B66JN4NRaa	they think it did but not maybe not exactly like homer predicted its kinda a mystery
eM1kHW1saa	that would b agood idea maybe u cud turn it into a dating book for emotions, each page paint a picture of a different emotion using all the kinds of colours ect that would make 1 hell of an art project in my opinion, but its ur choice
0BioKSmaaa	well really anything that can make you feel   yes, you can write about love  but you can also write about poetry itself  or hate   or death   or eating ice when drinking (i wrote a poem abt that)   berries (i wrote a triolet about those)   bannanss (my personal fav. fruit)   or think of a story and write about that   therez really no such thing as a good topic for poetry, you make a topic good     write about anything, seriously, anything that brings out ANY kind of emotion, articulate that emotion and begin to write...if you want more inspiration then try out shadowpoetry.com - that way you can explore different forms of poetry, that could help you out :)     hope i've helped   good luck :D|`|gZx04PRuaa	Absolutley anything.     When I write, i usually write about something that has happend to me in my life, that brings strong emotions to my mind so that the emotions inside me can transfer better onto the paper.     and when i write about things such as love, i write about the fantasies i have inside my head. As im a hopeless romantic, its easy to think of romantic things to put into a poem. And i write about the love i wish i had.     i also write about issues and such that i feel strongly about, because when the words you're writing mean something to you, its so easy to write more and more and develop the words in your mind into a beautiful masterpeice.     hope i helped.|`|p6qF7YdKaa	love  war  corruption  poverty  injustices  human rights  imagery of any kind (describe any kind of object i.e a flower)  pain  desire  death  life  you could write about something that motivates you, whether it be a sport or something you love like travelling. You could write about encounters with people in your life, things you've done, important people who meant something to you etc.    If you went to a country or a city and loved it, you could describe it with "magical" poetic language.

Click that, and drag the font you downloaded from the zip file onto the 'fonts' folder.    ORRRR if that doesn't work then...    To install a font, follow these steps:  Click Start, and then click Run.  Type the following command, and then click OK:  %windir%\fonts  On the File menu, click Install New Font.  In the Drives box, click the drive that contains the font that you want to add.    Note The floppy disk drive is typically drive A or drive B. The CD drive is typically drive D.  In the Folders box, click the folder that contains the font that you want to add, and then click OK.  In the List of fonts box, click the font that you want to add. To select more than one font at a time, press and hold the CTRL key while you select each font.  Click to select the Copy Fonts To Fonts Folder check box. The new font is saved in the Windows\Fonts folder.  Click OK.|`|g8kIjpwSaa	depends on whether you have a mac or PC|`|iqoShLwlaa	Cool.

AA11053540	Several of my ancestors lived to be more than 100.  My "favorite", though, is the "grandmother" (back a few generations!) that died on her birthday.  She was 100!  It may seem strange, what with all the hype on TV about people living longer, healthier lives, to see that during the Colonial era, many lived to their 90s or early 100s.   My Grandmother died at the young age of 81, but she washed her clothes (by hand), dried them on the line, ironed them (with an iron she had to heat on the stove), put her laundry away, cleaned house, cooked her supper, sat down...never to wake up.  Compare that to so many people, even younger, who are hooked up to oxygen, in a wheelchair, using a walker...or just outright in a nursing home!  Sorry, folks, the baloney they have been feeding you is simply not true. People, for the most part, are not healthier today.|`|I1Hu4jmyaa	1607 years old is the oldest that I can document.

He lived to be 110, she died at 108.  At one time, they were married 85 yrs and were the oldest living couple on social security.  Lots of rumors in the family and out that he did his share of sipping home made "sunshine".   The best story we have is when one of their sons, in his 80s at the time was in the hospital in Lawton, Ok. A new nurse who didn't know the family, became sure that he had dementia.. when he kept talking about needing to get better and released, so he could get home and help take care of his dad and mom.   I actually have 99% of records on this family, and it is a fact that longevity is genetic. At least one more of the cousins also lived to 100.
A6D0OkD7aa	Drawing is a really hard thing to do, and that picture is good. The fact that you know something's off means that you have a good eye for art. Try this: instead of drawing an actual line around the lips, make the lips slightly darker (or lighter?) than the skin. It will look more realistic because there is no dark line around a person's lips in real life.    Good job, good luck  and don't give up!!!!!|`|d0f5RJ8Jaa	great work!  you are right about the mouth - look again & you will notice that the upper part of face is tilted upwards, while the mouth suddenly moves downwards.  you can keep the nose intact. just shift the left side of mouth higher up to be in line with the central median axis. [a line drawn from between the eyes, nose, lips, chin ... bisecting the face into equal halves -- just for reference]   and i agree with an earlier poster about the dandelion - if you could show a couple of the florets of the blown dandelion floating in the air, it would be a perfect picture.      hope i helped  all the very best & keep drawing & having fun :-))|`|uJBnZWtcaa	LOL!  Ages ago I was whining to an artist friend that I never felt like any of my pieces was ever "right".  They just never seemed finished to me.  There always seemed to be more that I could do to make them better.    He looked at me, smiled and explained that the difference between a professional and an amateur was that the professional knew when to stop working on his art, when to put down the brush, the pen, the pencil.  It might not be perfect - and every artist is his or her own worst critic - but it was done.    Your drawing is wonderful.  It has an ethereal quality to it.

It's different and the meaning behind it seems moving and many could relate to it.  The lines are light and free just like the wish being blown from the dandelion- it's lovely  People have their own perception toward what looks real and what doesn't!

QXSFpMzDaa	between the 1300s-1600s it was known as the Renaissance.  Newton was influenced by:    Newton was influenced by many of the great astronomers and mathematicians who came before him. These greats include Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Descartes.  He was also a very religious man.    If you want to focus on gravity and astronomy, Copernicus developed the first heliocentric (or sun-centered) model of the solar system. Kepler furthered this idea by showing that the planets moved around the Sun in ellipses, instead of perfect circles as Copernicus had claimed. Newton was the first to claim that gravity was the cause of the motion of the planets moving in ellipses and later developed his calculations and laws of gravity to support his claims.    As far as gravity here on Earth, Descartes developed advances in geometry and mechanical math which provided a foundation for Newton's development of calculus and laws of physics. Newton also drew from Galileo's experiments, which included tests of gravity. However, Galileo wasn't working specifically on gravity, but rather to disprove Aristotle's claims that heavier object fell as a faster rate than lighter objects. Galileo proved that all objects (when you remove wind resistance) fall at the same speed and accelerate at the same rate. These experiments were also crucial to Newton's work in gravity.    Finally, regarding Newton's famous, "If I have seen further..." quote, some historians believe it was a humble acknowledgment of the work of his predecessors. However, Newton not being very humble, and having a rather short rival names Robert Hooke, may have been poking fun at Hooke for both his height and that fact that Hooke often claimed Newton stole his ideas.|`|849d6b13631f1ba99a0c1e7655b40d5faa	It's commonly known as the "Enlightenment" period, right before the Renaissance.|`|XGFiIY9Eaa	Scientific Revolution

yWloDrF8aa	The electricity supply in France is 220-230 V   In the USA it's 110-120 V   http://www.kropla.com/electric2.htm  So you will need not only an adaptor for the plug, you'll also need to step up the USA voltage from 110-120v to 220-230v.  You also need to know what the wattage of your appliance is, there should be that information on the appliance or on the packaging.  If it tells you the Amps you can find out the Watts by Volts (AC input) x Amps (Amperage) = Watts (Wattage)  For example 230V x 1.0A = 230W  You'll find a list of voltage transformers which will run 220 volt appliances from 110 volt electricity here -   http://www.dvdoverseas.com/store/index.h...
Ho9VGCmuaa	What key of harmonica you need in this case depends on:    1. the style of the song  2. your level of harmonica playing    If the song is really "folky" then a G harmonica with those chords is a no-brainer - you can pretty much blow-draw over everything except the Em chord (where you better stick with a lower chord blow)    But with all those 7th chords and also the Eminor in there, I'm betting its a little edgier than straight folk, in which case ideally you'd use a key of C harmonica which is the 2nd position for your key of G song    - but that's where your level of playing comes in, because it is going to sound best using a 2nd position C harmonica if you are good at playing single notes (such as the  2 blow with the Em chord) and ideally bending some notes too, which is what 2nd position is ideally suited for.    Try both if you can, playing the harmonica in a rack at the same time so you can really get a feel for it - it's a lot of fun to do!|`|ji7WZvC1aa	Key of G, I'd say.  That way you have chord I (and I7), chord IV (and IV7), chord V (and V7) and chord VI, which is a pretty common grouping.|`|At2JL4MVaa	If theres sheet music, check the key signature.    If theres no flats, no sharps, it's in the key of C    To name flat keys, find the second to last flat and this is the name of your key. For example, if there are three flats in the key signature (Bb, Eb, Ab) the key is called Eb major.  To name sharp keys, look at the last sharp in the key and raise it one half step. So if there is one sharp in the key signature (F), you would raise the F  to a G and call the key G major.  The two exceptions to this are the key of F and C. C major has no flats or sharps in the key signature, and F has one flat.  If there are any accidentals in the music that aren't in the key, then the key is some sort of minor.        Good luck (:

They would also tell you about the laws regarding his name.|`|49niWB6Qaa	Well that's up to you and the father. Legally, your child can have any name you want it to have. One couple named their daughter Sarah McCain Palin. If I had an awful last name such as Butkist or Dick, I would not give my child that last name.    So from a legal standpoint, no you do not have to change the baby's name (at least, not if you're a U.S. citizen. I don't know about the rules in other countries.)    However, if your boyfriend turns out not to be the father, he may be angry and he may want you to change the name. If so you must pay a fee and go to a court to get the name changed. (Again, this is for United States only. I don't know about other countries.)    Here are some odd names people have given to their children: http://www.momswhothink.com/baby-names/m...    and here is some info about changing a child's name: http://www.google.com/search?q=legal+nam...    And one other thing, the child's last name does not have to match either parent's last name, just so you know. If you want your child's last name to be Cheeseburger, you can do that (though I don't recommend it.) See http://www.plea.org/freepubs/ncn/ncnpg1.... Scroll down to "What names can I give to my children when they are born?"|`|L3hc9EOiaa	Depending on the state you live in, you are likely to need a court appearance to have the name changed if your guess was wrong, good on you for having the courage to take the dna test and remove the doubt. If your guess is wrong you more than likely going to have to apply to the state registry for births to have the correct fathers name inserted and records altered, and in that case yes his name will need to be changed to either your surname or his fathers surname, if you are not considering marrying the father I would be thinking about using your surname for the child.|`|VGhy6Wdxaa	did the guy your taking to get the test done sign the birth certificate? if so you dont have to change it i think it really depends on what state you live in.....i know a girl that claimed a different guy to be the dad he signed the certificate and she doesnt have to change the last name (turns out he wasnt the father)
