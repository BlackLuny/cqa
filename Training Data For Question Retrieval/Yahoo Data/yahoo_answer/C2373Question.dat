20081119161817AAfZnCh	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	What is the message of the story "Footprints in the Sand"?	I really love this story and I kind of get the message a little bit and I think that it's that God ill always be there for you, but I'm not sure.      One night a man had a dream.    He dreamed he was walking along the beach with the Lord.    Scenes from his life flashed across the sky   and he noticed two sets of footprints in the sand,   one belonging to him and the other to the Lord.    When the last scene of his life had flashed before him,   he recalled that at the lowest and saddest times of his life   there was only one set of footprints.    Dismayed, he asked, "Lord, you said that once I decided to follow you,   you'd walk with me all the way.   I don't understand why, when I needed you most,   you would leave me."    The Lord replied, "My precious child.   I love you and I would never leave you.    During your times of trial and suffering   when you saw only one set of footprints...    That was when I carried you."

20090227171000AAhdzTU	Education & Reference;Teaching	Why are US students doing poorly?	We now spend more in this country (counting Federal & State spending) for education than we do on the Military. Since 1975 the amount of money alloted for education has increased well past the point of inflation. How much money does it take to educate a student?!? It seems to me we had many smarter school graduates on a smaller budget until the introduction of Lowest Common Denominator educating tactics.     Yeah, nobody wants to know that *their* child is the brick of the class, but should we make the reasonably intelligent students suffer just to make the dopes feel better? It's a cruel wording, perhaps, but sugar-coating and denying reality gave us No Child Left Unbothered. What do you guys think?

20081122173204AAeVuaI	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Grades Slipping! How do I get my Euro grade up?	Ok, so this might sound a little strange but:   Last year, I was in all Accelerated (Honors) classes, and managed to get straight A's in them, which gave me, and the 2 others who did this to, to be given Rank One, and top 1%, which I was aiming for.       This year, I moved up to AP Euro, and it's EXTREMELY harder than I thought it'd be, and I'm getting a B, which I stress out about all the time. One of the other Rank Ones is getting a C, the other is getting a low A. I shut down on tests, and average a C on them, but I do well in discussions, which are my grade boosters. If I can get an 85 up to a 89, I can get an A, but I don't know how, because I end up studying for weeks for the tests, then do pretty horrible on them.    If anyone's been in this, or a similar class, and had similar situations, what did you do to raise your grade?      BTW, getting anything lower than Rank, say, 3 is not an option for me at all, getting lower than 1 is bad enough.

20090227172431AAFMJGi	Education & Reference;Teaching	Tenses to use with RIGHT NOW?	I am an American resident, but not an English native speaker so I have some difficulty with grammar issues. In some cases it's only America, like the use of do to ask "Have you?" in other occasions it's a little trikier.      I would like some clarification about clauses that contain the time expression “right now”      The exercise I had to do was to put a verb in the passive voice in this phrase;   “Let’s get some popcorn. It’s fresh. It __(use the verb make)__ right now.”   I decided that there were four ways to complete the sentence:   1. “Let’s get some popcorn. It’s fresh. It was made right now.”   2. “Let’s get some popcorn. It’s fresh. It has been made right now.”   3. “Let’s get some popcorn. It’s fresh. It’ made right now.”   4. “Let’s get some popcorn. It’s fresh. It’s being made right now.”      I was told that only the last one is correct because “right now” admits only a present progressive conjugation of the verb.   That seems very strange maybe because I apply to English some idea that I bring from my mother tongue the Italian equivalent of “right now” to me seems to be “proprio ora” that can be “in this moment an not an instant before” but usually is intended as an indeterminate period of time that is very, but still not quantified as much, close to now.   So of the 4 aforesaid clauses the one that sound odd to my ear is the 4, and the 3 also,   why must we go now that the corn is still popping? In 1 and 2 the right now contrast with an undetermined “time ago”.   But as I said before I was told that RIGHT NOW requires present progressive as a rule (and in fact I found with ease the phrase “Neither of them is available to speak right now.” in a web page that concerns English grammar).         I will be grateful for any consideration about this issue.

Well I figured it was just a term for an anime fan but I've read somewhere once before that someone would never call them self an otaku and that it was bad or something. So I looked it up on Urban Dictionary and it said "Otaku is extremely negative in meaning as it is used to refer to someone who stays at home all the time and doesn't have a life (no social life, no love life, etc)"   So is this an accurate definition or did someone with a negative view on anime/manga probably write this?If it isn't the true meaning, what IS it? I've personally refrained from calling myself an otaku because of this,but recently I've become curious as to what it really means. Thank you for any help.         Sources : Urban Dictionary

I want to go to college, its very important to me and I know I want to go to BYU, theres no doubt about that. But I'm having trouble about what to decide to major in. I've recently been extremely interested in music. I can play a little piano by ear, but it usually only excites me when its music I WANT to learn to play. But the sound of music also amazes me. Hearing the different instruments and such, its wonderful. But I also like to understand things and people. Like why and how things work. Or why people act the way they do. I like to learn...if its on a subject that interests me. Which is why I want to major in something I really am interested in, so that way I know I will do quite well. I don't plan on becoming a musician or a scientist, I don't even want a big, fancy job really, just something I love to do. So does anyone have an ideas of what I could look in to? Or examples of what your occupation is and what you do (if it relates to my previous interests). Or any ideas that could help me at all. Thank you for your help. :)

20090227171456AAMaIw9	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Class Problems, what should I do?	I'm a third year civil engineering major who is having schedule problems for next quarter. Basically, our university requires a course for graduation  (CEE 103), but the course is only offered once a year in the Spring. No one offers this course over the summer. Moreover, 103 is a prerequisite for another course (CEE 135A) that is only offered during the Fall Quarter. Also, 135A is a prerequisite for a list of courses I need for graduation. So, no 103 equals no 135A equals no graduation.  There's about 15 other kids in the same position as me. I talked to a counselor and he said they have limited resources and they can't do anything about it. If they have limited resources why would they accept so many students? He also told me that I should change the emphasis of my degree, or come back and drop another twenty grand for a fifth year (dude's a moron). I emailed the professor and he told me he can't do anything. What should I do? Who can I talk to? Can the department chair do anything? If I email the department chair what should I say to him? Personally, I think this entire situation is a load of ****.

O c'è dell'altro? Ricordo che quando andavo a scuola io, malgrado i miei ottimi voti, era raro che mi chiamassero secchiona perchè per il resto ero una ragazza normale, tutta minigonna, trucco e riviste di musica; mentre chiamavano secchiona una mia compagna che portava gli occhiali, si vestiva un po' da zitellina e trattava tutti con malagrazia. Senza contare che lei sgobbava (per sua stessa ammissione) 8 ore al giorno, mentre io studiavo soltanto 3-4 ore perchè alcune materie le imparavo facilmente e per le altre facevo molta attenzione in classe... insomma, il secchione è solo uno che prende buoni voti o essere secchioni è anche uno stile di vita?

20090227175151AAZjrml	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Can you pleases help me summarize this ( 10 pts)?	Does someone in your home have the sniffles? If so, beware of doorknobs and the TV remote control. A recent study found that cold sufferers often leave their germs on common household surfaces. There, the study showed, viruses can live for two days—or longer.      The two-part study was designed at the University of Virginia. The school has long been recognized for its research into a branch of science called virology. The study attempted to learn more about germs. It also aimed to lay the groundwork for future research into methods for stopping the infectious viruses. To conduct their research, scientists tested various surfaces in the homes of people suffering from colds.      In the first part of the study, scientists gathered 30 adults who displayed early signs of colds. Testing later discovered that 16 of the 30 had been infected with rhinovirus. This virus is responsible for about half of all colds. The 16 people were asked to list 10 places in their homes that they had touched in the previous 18 hours. Scientists then used DNA tests to hunt for rhinovirus in those locations.      Scientists didn't have to search too carefully to find what they were looking for. Germs were everywhere. All three of the salt and pepper shakers they tested were contaminated with the rhinovirus. So were 8 of 10 bathroom faucets, 3 of 4 dishwasher handles, and 6 of 10 remote controls. In addition, 8 of 14 refrigerator handles, 4 of 7 telephones, 6 of 18 doorknobs, and 3 of 13 light switches tested were also found to be harboring the virus.         "We found that commonly touched areas like refrigerator doors and handles [tested] positive [for cold germs] about 40 percent of the time," said Dr. Birgit Winther. Winther is an ear, nose, and throat specialist. She helped with the research.      For the second part of the study, scientists attempted to determine how long the viruses remained on the household surfaces. To do this, scientists smeared various household surfaces with the people's germs. They then tested to see whether rhinovirus stuck to their fingers. The 16 adults went about their day as usual. They turned on lights. They answered the telephone. More than half of the people got the virus on their fingertips. This was 48 hours after the surfaces had been contaminated with the germs.      To some experts, these results were not surprising. Last year, during the cold and flu season, Dr. Diane Pappas and Dr. Owen Hendley went germ-hunting. They examined toys in the offices of five pediatricians. Their tests uncovered traces of cold viruses. In fact, 20 percent of the toys they tested harbored germs.      These days-old viruses live on surfaces. They are proven to be transferable. Are they still powerful enough, however, to cause someone to become sick? Dr. Paul Auwaerter is an infectious-diseases specialist at Johns Hopkins University. According to Auwaerter, no proof exists that the traces of older viruses themselves can infect. He recognizes, however, that their presence does suggest that it's a risk worthy of concern.      Until further research is done, doctors say that people should try to protect themselves from becoming infected. Some experts recommend the use of hand sanitizers or face masks. They point to a University of Michigan study. The study followed 1,000 students for six weeks. The students were divided into three groups. One group wore masks, the second group wore masks and used hand sanitizer, and the third group did neither. The two groups who used masks reported 10 percent to 50 percent fewer signs of colds than the group that took neither preventative measure.      Hand sanitizers and masks appear to help prevent infection. However, doctors remind that frequent hand washing will go a long way toward preventing the spread of germs in the first place.

20090227174035AA0c4Cy	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Can ANYONE plz HELP me ?	I have completed my FAFSA about one month ago and I got my SAR back which said that my EFC was 0. So I was told that after you fill out the FAFSA all you have to do is wait for the schools to get the information, so they could send you a reward letter and tell you what you would get. But one day a college that I had got accepted to called me and asked did I make a decision, and i told them that I am waiting to see what I would get from the reward letter before I made my decision because i had submitted my FAFSA already. Then she said that I needed to submit the deposit in order to get the reward letter, and that once I did it they would send out the reward letter and tell me what I would get. But she said that they deposit was refundable before a certain date if I decided not to attend to the college. So now that leaves me wondering, that are the other colleges that accepted me waiting for deposits in order to give me a reward letter because i don't have that kind of money to send out to various colleges. So can somebody please help me and try to explain the best way you can. How does this whole reward letter thing work? What do you need to do to get a reward letter?

For my Intro to Early Childhood class, we have to complete observation hours with a preschooler/kindergartener, and do experiments with them based on ideals of Piaget's conservation tasks and one of Froebel's gifts.       While Piaget has been drilled into my head for the past 2 years and I fully understand what I have to do, Froebel is rather unfamiliar to me. I know what each of the gifts and occupations are, but I don't really understand how to employ them. Everywhere I look, online and in notes, the descriptions are very broad, and almost whimsical. I understand that these are meant to be absract, but I'm having trouble figuring out a way to re-create gifts.       Could someone please advise me on how to make and present the gift experiment to the child I'm observing? (Please don't post a link to a website that sells Froebel's gifts, I have no money to spend on them.)

20090225072740AAIBYRS	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	What does the last sentence want to say?	I would like you to read the paragraph below and answer the following questions.      We are all aware that work and family life conflict, but as couples work out what will be sacrificed in the wake of the birth of a child, the expectations that the mother's career will suffer rather than the father's proved strong. Women are still responsible for the same proportion of childcare as they were in the 1960s --a stubborn 80%. So what does it mean when men, particularly aspiring men, begin giving up highly paid jobs to spend more time at home? Are we finally beginning to see a more equal division of responsibilities over childcare? Or is it simply that we are all working such long hours that we should not be surprised when even the highest achievers throw their hands up and cry:"That's enough"?      Question1   What does the last sentence want to say?   I roughly understand it means but not hundred percent. Does it mean,   "Most of men have worked a lot so it's natural that some of them give up their jobs?"      Question 2    What does the word 'even ' mean in this context? i mean, i think that generally achievers have lots of money, so it's not surprising for them to give up their jobs?      Question 3   Who do you think the writer wants to imply by ' the highest achievers'--- does he (she) mention the world top rich such as William Henry Gates III??       I need your help, thank you.
