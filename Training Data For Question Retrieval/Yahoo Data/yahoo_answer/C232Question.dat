20070716125949AA59QB7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Pour parents ou futurs parents seulement...?	Une jeune a fille a demandé pourquoi son père la surprotège mais pas son frère (surtout avec le sex opposé). Les réponses étaient toutes "parce que les pères savent comment les gar?ons pensent". Je trouve ceci tresse regrettable. Ma question est: est-ce que vous avez ce genre de double standard? si oui, ne croyez-vous pas que vous leur envoyer un message bien spécifique? tel que, "mon gars vas-y, c'est pas grave, c'est sa responsabilité ..de toute fa?on tu es un homme tu ne peux te contr?ler... ma fille les hommes sont contr?lé par leur hormones et n'ont aucune responsabilité avec leur sexualité, les hommes vont toujours vous voir comme des objets sexuels"??? J'ai un fils qui approche l'adolescence, je lui est toujours apprit que les gar?ons et les filles sont égaux et que chacun ont leur part de responsabilités.Si j'avais une fille je serais aussi protectrice envers lui que je le serais avec elle. Je ne laisserais pas mon conjoint changer cela.      Vos commentaires sont appréciés.

20090128211820AA1uv7b	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Infant car seat installation problems with Honda Pilot?	We have a '06 Honda Pilot, and no matter how many things I try I can't seem to get the base of an infant car seat to install snugly against the seat. Whether using the LATCH or the seat-belt, I can put pressure on the base and tighten until I'm blue in the face, but the end of the base near the front of the seat still comes up easily no matter what.     I remember I had this problem in our Honda Civic as well, but finally I was able to get it tight enough that the base would not come up. With the Pilot, no luck so far. I have tried two different seats and done a lot of research to figure out solutions. I've seen the seats like the Britax Companion that has the "anti-rebound" bar, but those are very expensive and not readily available. I can't imagine that other people haven't had this problem as well... Please help!

Im already disappointed in myself...   well my boyfriend and I one night decided together that we should do i..we should have sex. we decided in the heat of the moment and so I told him to put it in but he didn't have a condom on..so it was in for like less than 30 seconds before he went and got a condom...well a few days later my period came.. I know that usually means that you aren't pregnant but someone told me that its still possible that i might be...He told me that the first time it was in he didn't c** which relieved me but im still worried.   I love him very much and I know he loves the same. That was the very first time for me to have sex and I don't regret it at all but I wish we could have been smarter about it. Im disappointed in myself for not waiting till I was married but I know that I don't want to do that with anyone else. We are both so deeply in love that sex doesn't matter but we were both curious and wanted to see how it would feel together.   PLEASE help me understand a little bit better.

20090128212902AAEP5by	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	A potential miscarriage at 5 weeks?	im 5 weeks pregnant and recently had some spotting over the last 3 days. When i noticed the bleeding i immediately went to the hospital where they issued blood tests which all came back fine. I had an ultrasound yesterday which showed that my sac has grown since my last ultrasound taken last week. Today i went to an early pregnancy clinic at the hospital where they again took blood and told me my HCG levels had gone up a bit since 3 days ago but enough to where they should be. They also told me that nothing can be seen at the moment in the sac. They told me it was unlikely that im pregnancy would be ongoing and suggested a D&C. Im extremely upset and confused as everything seemed to be going ok when speaking to other doctors. Im wondering if its possible that the baby just isnt growing as fast as it should be and if theres a chance it could survive. Ive heard from others that they were told to give up for this reason and went on to have their children. Please help me.

20061013220959AA9Q1Se	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Not sure if I should test?	Labor Day Weekend I forgot my pills & missed 3 days. I had intercourse and used the pull-out method (I know, stupid of me, but I figured I'd probably be OK b/c of the pill). So I started a 2-day period early the next day and started taking my pills again to finish my cycle. I only had 1 day of bleeding on my normally scheduled period and have not missed any more days on my pill. I've been really stressed out at school (I'm in my first semester at a fairly exclusive RN program) and having some nausea/bloating (but no vomiting, weight gain, or excess fatigue) for about 3 weeks. Anyways, I'm now on day 2 of my sugar pills and no period. I don't know if I'm just being paranoid and feeling bad due to the stress, or if I should be worried about being pregnant? I have a major exam on Tues and am too freaked out to take a HPT. Should I take one anyways or should I wait it out and see if my period is just off b/c of the missed pills last month?

I ovulated on the 22nd of october we were ttc and on the night of the 23rd i got a sharp pain where I usally get my cramps at. Every since that night I have been been sick to my stomach during the day with it eventually going away.       Also my nipples have become erect every since the 24th and the areolas have became darker and little bumps have appeared on them.

I am not suppose to start till the 5th and it is driving me crazy! I know morning sickenss usally doesn't start until later in the pregnancy, so I am curouis to know what others think.       Thank you for your time.

20090225155903AAbmUA5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How long did your kids go through this phase for?	My 12-month-old seems to think EVERYTHING is a piece of food. I vacuum the carpets regularly, but even after they've JUST been swept, she manages to find a tiny speck of something...and in her mouth it goes! She's not picky...a little string from her blanket, a crumb of something-or-other from under the couch, a live ant (that was the most recent surprise...I don't even know how we got an ant in the house in mid February in NE Ohio!! Moreover, I don't know how she caught the little bugger!!!!). Inevitably, I find myself pinning her down several times a day to dig something out of her mouth that shouldn't be there and is just seconds away from being swallowed. This, of course, causes a huge battle every single time. I'm not really concerned that these things will sicken her, I'm just wondering when I can expect her to find something more interesting to do, other than forage for random foreign objects to eat. Any suggestions on how to divert her attention? Nothing really seems to work. And trust me, she's very well-fed. This isn't a hunger issue! Thanks!

Tell me if you're a parent or a teenager and where you live (as vague or specific as you want) also if it's rural, urban or suburban.      I'm 15, and I get $30 a week. For that, I keep the kitchen clean, do the dinner dishes every night, keep the dining room clean, and do a major scrubbing job on the bathroom and kitchen each week. I also have to maintain good grades, and stay on top of stuff like piano. If I slack off on school stuff and piano, I lose money. If I do something really bad (which I haven't, for the record) I'll lose allowance completely and still have to do the jobs.      I have to pay for everything. Transportation not covered by my student Metrocard, music, games, movies (at $12 a ticket), clothes besides a twice-a-year setup, school supplies after the beginning of the year, cat litter, cat food...you get the idea.      I think it's a good system.      (I live in Manhattan.)

20090225160552AAnjD6o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Why are some parents so scared when their toddlers ask where babies come from?	It seems so common that parents freak out (at least on TV) when their kids ask where babies come from. It's like all they wanna know is how they came to be. I think they parents feel the kid wouldn't understand sex and don't wanna discuss that because they feel it is personal and the child wouldn't understand so they delay telling the kid until he has started school. Apparently the adults of forgotten what it felt like to be kids at that moment decide the rift is to big for the child to cross over to understand human reproduction without thinking its gross.

20090225154855AAUxeqC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	PREGNANT: I just found out that my thirty year old son got a woman pregnant!?	He has no job, he dropped out of college, he has blue balls, he lives in his parent's garage, and he got a woman who is not his longtime fiancée (10years) pregnant. The woman just turned 18 and plans on keeping the baby even though she didn't finish high school and her parents kicked her out. She is now sleeping on our front lawn because she got in a fight with my son and he won't let her back in to the garage. What should we do? Should we raise the kid as our own and get a restraining order against our son? Should we get third jobs so that we can support our son, the girl he got pregnant, and the new baby? Or should we move away?

I have been having wierd "cramp" like feelings in my lower abdomin (and i know its not because of a period because i NEVER get cramps when i have my period), peeing a little more often and if sore breasts consist of being sore on the sides only when you touch them then i have sore breasts, After almost every time i eat, i get a little stomach ache afterwards. also, i have been taking my temp. which was a steady 98.4 and then a few days ago went up to 98.6 and this morning was 98.8, and might i add that i had the worst mood yesterday. Does this sound like pregnancy? Is it too soon to test? My husband and I are ttc, Thanks in advance.

20090225155318AA4NVxM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Add on from the last....?	We changed his formula to soy milk advised by Dr.Stammler to add a small amount of cereal to the soy milk.  Upon this doctor's visit, The Doctor also explained Pyloric Stenosis (which: is a condition that can cause your baby to vomit forcefully and often and may cause other problems such as dehydration and salt and fluid imbalances).  Dr.Stammler said, if he worsens or persists then he will need an abdominal ultrasound.          ON NOV. 27, 2008, we took Noah to the Emergency Room at Lodi memorial hospital at 12:45pm because his gums started bleeding.  To my horror the ER did nothing, Dr. Ali advised us to cut his nails and sent us home.          Noah is now just shy of 2 days of being 2 months old.  We have been back and forth from several doctors' appointments and a trip to the ER with absolutely no resolution as to what is going on with our son's constant medical issues.          On (Dec. 4, 2008) we took Noah to get his first shots, he seemed to take it well.  However during the visit, I asked Dr. Stammler about Noah bruising so easily.  I notice the bruising mostly after he wakes up and also after picking him up.          After I reported my concerns, Doctor Stammler sent us to the Healthcare Clinical Laboratories to get a blood tests for Noah.          Two ladies' came in by the names of Courtney and Patty to draw the blood form Noah, why it took two nurses to draw the blood from, I do not understand.  They had me hold my son upward in my lap with my hands on his chest, while they looked for a vein.  Courtney then asked me to squeeze him tighter; I just sat there and held him, (Courtney) then put her hand on mine and pushed.  My son was screaming so bad I then turned and blew into his mouth so he could take a breath.  They poked him 2-3 times in his left arm, 1-2 times in his right arm and 1 in each hand.  They got a little blood, then asked me to come back on Monday or Tuesday Dec.8th or Dec.9th.  I then came back with my friend Brianna on Monday the 8th, again it was two ladies' by the name of Courtney and Jennifer, and one was the same nurse from the appointment on Dec. 4th, the other nurse was one I haven't seen before.  At first they were going to try to take blood while he was in his car seat.  But, the nurse from the last time we came in, picked him up and held him, she held his left upper arm above his elbow while the other held below his elbow.  They searched for a vein and they just poked him, they shook the needle around in his arm and he screamed while she held him still.  They then poked him in his left hand and finally got blood.  For the next 2 days or so, Noah did not move his arm in the mornings, he just kept it still.  I called Doctor Stammler to make another Appointment as soon as possible, but then Noah started moving his arm that night, so I didn't take him.          On Dec. 13TH, we brought Noah back to the Emergency Room at Lodi Memorial hospital at 2:38am. Noah had been crying, falling asleep and waking up off and on. The last time Noah woke up he cried a little, I saw a little swelling on his left side of his face, it looked as if something was going from his forehead down his whole left side.  I immediately got him ready and headed for the ER. As we were leaving, we noticed under his left eye it started to bruise. While we were in the ER, I was looking at him, noticed his arm swollen and his hand bruising as if it wasn't getting circulation.  I told the nurse to get the doctor, she said she would and she'd note my concern.  The Doctor never came, therefore he never saw Noah's hand, but a nurse came in to gave Noah 2 shots to take the swelling down. They said it was ERYSIPELAS (WHICH IS A SUDDEN FORM OF CELLUITIS.) I didn't believe it is Erysipelas, but I know there is something wrong.          They asked us to come back the next evening, we did on Dec.13th.  They gave him two more shots then called the police to file a CPS report for suspected child-abuse, but the claim was without warrant.  CPS did not take custody at this time.          On Dec.18TH, I took Noah to a checkup because Dr. Stammler was out and I couldn't get one sooner.  So Doctor Danni Basset checked Noah; she said he was fine and healthy.  She checked his blood tests and it said his platelets were HIGH, and his white blood count was LOW.  She told me Noah was ok, so I went home.  Noah and I played for a bit, then I noticed he had diarrhea real bad so I gave him a bath; he got real tired, so I dressed him and put him down for a nap. Aaron came home for lunch , Noah woke up, Aaron then picked him up, changed him and brought him out to me.  I made Noah a bottle, but Aaron noticed bruising on the inside of his right hand, Noah had it on his left hand before too.            I called Dr. Dannie, she sent me to a pediatrician by the name of Doctor Ishi. When I met with HIM on Dec.18th, Dr. Ishi stated, Noah was fine and healthy and that he may have sucked on his hand which may have left the marks on his hand, WHICH made no sens

Of course, it could still come either today or tomorrow.....but otherwise it would be 'later' than usual. One week ago, after having sex she experienced some light bleeding. She thought it was her period...but it went away the next day. Was that bleeding a result of having sex? She is under a lot of stress lately - could it be a result of that? Could it have been 'implantation bleeding'? We use condoms when having sex. I suppose I am just getting a little stressed, as neither of us are ready for a baby at this point in time.

20070625085144AAwDskJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Which one has it worse--someone homeless, or someone young and pregnant?	Well, which one do you think? And could you please provide feedback or reasons? Let me clarify just a few things. When I say "homeless," I don't mean someone staying with their friend or aunt...I mean someone that has nowhere to go, no true friends or anyone to stay with. Someone who is pretty much stuck sleeping on the streets, in a shelter, or forgoing sleep completely. Someone that is a decent person(doesn't do drugs, isn't lazy, has held jobs) but became homeless due to crap luck/situations.  When I say "pregnant," I am referring to someone that is unmarried, fairly young(late teen, early 20s) and not alone, but not in a committed relationship she can definitely rely on.      So which one(in general, in your opinion) has a scarier situation ahead of her?

20070807170521AABBk9A	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Question on a fertility herb Mira Puama?	hi       has any one ever heard of Muira Puama which they say is a very interesting  choice for a fertility herb for women. It comes from the Amazon Rainforest - home of some of the most potent herbs in the world, and is used worldwide to help both men and women with reproductive problems.

20070810134644AAtIwVb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	I know i was ovulating....?	around july 31-aug.3 and on midnight of aug.1-2 while having sex the condom broke inside me and we didn't notice till he pulled out after he came. so the CM leaked out and into my...vagina. Okay first question....since he still had the condom somewhat on wouldnt that reduce my chances? and what are the chances if my ovulation thingy is so wide in possible days that i MIGHT have ovulated....the condom was not spirmicidal and i herd that if the sperm where in the condom for a bit that they die???

20070807120416AAe2zRQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	How Do I Know If I Am Ovulating?	Hi. I have been trying to conceive since August 5th, 2007. My last period was July 25th, 2007 and lasted 5 days and was average. Before that it was on June 25th, 2007 and lasted 5 days and was heavy. My periods are always are from 30 days to 35 days long. I know because of this it makes my day of ovulation hard to pinpoint. :o( I am going to get a Ovulation Predictor kit tomorrow. But I'd like to see what you have to say about "How To Tell". I have been receiving abdominal cramps since the 5th of this month at night. I also rarely ever get cervical mucus that is like egg whites. Instead it's watery and clear, instead of like egg whites. I go from a little watery, to a lot watery during my time of ovulating. I've never had any spotting before in my midcycle. I know those 2 things could indicatate ovulation but what about abdominal cramping? What else?...    Also please give me your own ways of telling how you can tell when you are... Thanks.

20080501100557AAdlc1G	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Does pregnancy cause mass confusion???	Me and my wife have been married for 3 months she found out she was pregnant 5 months ago (its mine believe me)  I live in vegas and she flew to Oregon to stay with her mom telling me shes real confused and she doesnt know who she is anymore, she doesnt know her favorite color anymore,  but is this all caused by pregnancy hormones?  Before she was pregnant everything was perfect.  A week after she took the pregnancy test that said positive  she went looney tunes! Now we are working things out but she is coming home again this tuesday but, Im at the point where I dont even know if shes going to get on the plane shes so confused.  Is this all caused by pregnancy?  im 24 shes 20.
