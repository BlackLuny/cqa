20080607091322AAZMz52	Pets;Dogs	Creen que es mejor esto a la esterilizacion ? piensenlo por no esterilizar y se tiene que hacer esto ?	Continuará la cacería de perros   La campa?a de exterminio en Peto se reanuda el jueves      PETO.— En la localidad y comisarías cercanas se implementará de nuevo la campa?a de exterminio de perros callejeros, que podrían afectar la salud de la gente, afirma Víctor Manuel Vázquez Aké, coordinador de combate al dengue y zoonosis.      El empleado municipal indica que la meta de la campa?a es el exterminio de 150 animales. A la fecha llevan 60 sacrificios.      "La campa?a comenzó desde hace varias semanas, pero entró en una etapa de receso, y la próxima semana se volverá a retomar hasta llegar a la meta".      Víctor Vázquez Aké afirma que ya se invitó a las familias que quieran que se sacrifique a sus mascotas porque ya no las puedan atender, para que se acerquen al personal y soliciten el apoyo.      "El próximo jueves comenzará la campa?a de nuevo en la cabecera, luego será en la comisaría de Xoy y otras comunidades para erradicar también el problema en esos lugares".      Vázquez Aké sugiere que cuando salgan de cacería a las calles, capturarán a cualquier perro que ande por las calles.      "Por eso pedimos a la gente que a partir de ese día no dejen sueltos a sus perros, ya que podrían ser capturados".      El funcionario se?ala que al capturar a los animales les aplicarán una anestesia y luego la vacuna letal.      "La sustancia que se les aplica está autorizada por la Secretaria de Salud para este tipo de campa?as".      "Ya se construyó una zanja para poner los cadáveres y evitar que sean un foco de infección".— Dulce Yazmín Ku Chi      _________________      Si, se?ores gobernantes de los Estados de México, como decía su ex presidente FOX siguen estando a un paso del primer mundo, la pregunta es cuándo darán este paso.Si se les termina la anestesia, les sugiero que busquen a la patrulla de policía de Xicotepec para que vaya atropellando perros con su carro.

I currently have it on the side of the tank, only becuase there is a warning on the actual  pad that says do not let tank rest on the cord or the plastic housing.

20090203133124AABLpIB	Pets;Fish	Goldfish is sick, help?	I was pretty sure it had ick (white spots on fins) so I started treating him with Wardley's ick medicine. Its been 2-3 weeks and the ick is still present and now the fishy has fin and tail rot. His tail is even bleeding some. He still has a good appetite. I'm doing almost every other day 25%-50% water changes. He is all alone in a 5 gallon tank with filtration (although I took out the carcoal as directed by the medication). Is there something out there that is better medicine for him that will treat the fin rot and the ick both at the same time? This fishy is like 7+ years old!

Sometimes he will just stay there and sleep, but he comes out when I call him.   My friend told me that when he stays under something, it means that he was taken away from his mother too early. Is this true?? If so, is it okay to let him stay under there?   He also has an umbilical hernia (which I looked up and I am taking him to the vet next week to ask the vet about it)  if that has to do with anything?      I read that dogs are den animals and like to feel protected and it should be okay but I'm just making sure...   Thank you in advance!

My family, (Me, husband and three children, 9,5,&3) Rescued a beautiful male pit bull from a private rescue group when he was 8 months old. He is a little over a year and just a big LOVE BUGG!!! My mother will not let up on how the breed has Lock-Jaw and how I should get rid of him and get a "NICER" breed like a lab. We absolutly love him and he has never once shown aggression towards any of us. We could never give him up. He sleeps in bed with our 3 year old daughter every night. He is neutered and the only dog in our household. He is well socialized with other dogs and people. Is there reason for concern and I read "Lockjaw" is a myth. Is that true?

20090203134037AAaVBxK	Pets;Rodents	How do i convince my parents for a hamster?	I was at my friends sleepover birthday party and they had a ton of pets, as in eleven. A dog, cat, rabbit, 2 toads, 2 birds, 3 hamsters, and a fish. My parents are exactly the oposite. They both had dogs as kids, and won't let us get a dog. So I gave up with the dog, all i get is a firm no. So when I was at my friend's house and I saw one of there hamsters I grew attached. He was cute and friendly and the most adorable thing I've ever seen. He was a teddy bear hamster. When I got home immediately told my parents I want a hamster. My Mom was considering it at first and for awhile, talking to me about hamsters, and looking at names with me online, but after two days my mom doesn't think I can handle the responsibility and told me it was my dad's decision. How can I convince my parents that I'm responsible enough to clean the cage, feed the hamster, and make sure he/she stays safe. I didn't hear an answer from my dad yet, well I only asked him a few days ago, and he was just lecturing me on the responsibilities, he said nothing of a no, yes, or maybe.    Also I was thinking if i were to get a hamster (i've already got a spot to put the hamster and his/her cage) I would get either two russian dwarves or one teddy bear hamster. I did my research and apparently if two russian dwarves are kept together and grow up together they  can live together safely, but of course I would get two hamsters of the same gender.      Any other tips having to do with hamster care would also be really appreciated.

Aparte, mucha gente que prefiere a los perros, dice que "el pelo del gato provoca cancer y/o asma" PURA MENTIRA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, el pelo del gato, no puede producir cancer y/o asma a las personas, al contrario, el gato ayuda a prevenir infarto (el gato, no el pelo, el gato), asi que piensen antes de elegir.

20090222115144AAu83jC	Pets;Rodents	How do I get my new hamster not to bite me?	I just got a hamster about a week ago, and he's very hyper. I tried to hold him once and he went to bite me. I looked online and it said to put your hand down in a fist, so he can get my smell. Then, it said to put my hand down with a raisin and some of his bedding, and he should come. So I let him go into his ball, then I let him go into my hand. He got out a little, took the raisin then went back into his ball. After he was done with his raisin, he went into my hand sniffed a little then bit my finger. I think it's because he has an edible house and chews on everything else, but I don't know why he chews on me. Can somebody give me an answer, or at least some advice.

He is fully house trained, and there is never a problem when I am home.

20090222191803AABaXlR	Pets;Horses	Possible reasons/ways to fix refusals?	My 21 year old arab refuses absolutely everything. He is in prime physical shape, and when I actually get him over the jump it's no problem; never hits the poles or anything. He's even refused flat poles on the ground, so I don't think it's a height issue.    He is never reluctant to do anything else and never shows any pain. He has no issues with the way his tack fits; he even refuses bareback.    My coach says it's probably because he's spoiled rotten (he's stubborn in every other aspect) Is it likely that this is the problem? How can I fix it?    Right now when he refuses I just back him up and kick him over as long as the jump's small. This works but hasn't stopped the refusals.

20090222192756AAphS7i	Pets;Reptiles	How important is it to spray down the substrate in my ribbon snake cage daily?	When I got my ribbon snake, they told me to spray the substrate with water every day to keep it moist (The substrate I use is this thing that is kind of like soil or dirt and peat moss. It comes in a dry block, and you put it in water to expand it.) Is this necessary? Why should I do this? I also read that if the tank is wet then the snake can get an infection. Isn't it safer to make sure that the substrate is dry rather than making it moist?   10 pts to best answer!

20090222184248AAjdMH2	Pets;Horses	What do you think of my horse? (pics)?	Margo is a reg AWR mare. She is out of the German Imported C lined Holsteiner stallion, Carlost. She is 10yo and 16.3 hands. She was shown at Devon when she was younger and placed very high considering how much younger she was than all of the other horses. Margo has over 1 year professional training. she has also been shown as well. Margo is currently in training again as well. She has three perfect gaits and goes on the bit or on a loose reins. She can collect and extend all three gaits as well. She is currently doing 3'6 hunter courses and for jumpers has done as 4'9.  A few years ago she was doing between 1st and 2nd level dressage. I have been working on reconditioning her with that, hence currently being in training.

I did all the things that I normally would avoid doing such as petting the dog and then rubbing my eyes, rubbing my nose and putting my face into the fur of the dog.  I had no reaction but about an hour later the back of my neck was a little red.  I had no watering eyes, runny nose, etc.  I took no medication before or after the meeting with the breeder.  What do you think?  Is this a good choice or not (for allergies)?

20090222185018AAdN0SO	Pets;Dogs	My german Shepherd barks at everything. How do i keep her quiet and behaved?	I have a 4 year old pure bred german shephard and she barks at every thing. When we let her out into the back yard, she barks unless someone is with her to play with her. She doesnt bark at anyone in the house, but she barks at everyone she sees out the window. I think she likes to bark because she tries to look out of a window even when we block the windows. We tried taking her to see my cousins 6 month old german shephard, and it was a bad idea. She was out of control and foaming from her mouth. How can i get her to behave and get along?

20090222190254AAqzRNp	Pets;Dogs	My dog is sick and i dont know whats wrong with him?	My puppy (4 month) old started thrrowing up thursday night and he also had diarrhea. In the afternoon he was just fine. He was also very calm and stopped eating. he was still drinkin tho.    Friday I made him some chicken and rice for his stomach but he wouldnt even eat that. He was gettin more active again so i thought he would feel better. but friday night he didnt drink anymore and threw up every hour. his diarrhea was green, the puke slimy kinda yellowish. Saturday  mornin i took him 2 the vet and they kept him there and gave him an IV. i posted a question on here and ppl told me it is parvo. i went to the vet and told him 2 run a parvo test. thank god it was negative. hes still not feelin better. im goin to the vet a couple times a day 2 check on him. today the vet told me they will do an x-ray and a sonograph.    my other puppy (they r brothers) had green diarrhea 2day and he also puked. i just brought him 2 the vet as well so they can watch him. the vet told me they could have the corona virus. but wouldnt he have seen that in the poop. he didnt find anything in the poop. Do you specificly need 2 seaarch for that? i read on the internet that they can get that virus from other dogs but they have only been around my dogs (we have 5 dogs, 3 puppies and their mom and dad). im really worried about them.   if anybody has experienced the same or knows what it could b please let me know.
20090222190850AAtXC8o	Pets;Dogs	My 4yo black lab is acting strange...?	Yesterday, my husband stopped my dog from chasing the cat by putting his foot in front of her. His foot didn't touch her.

20090222194122AA2wNLy	Pets;Dogs	What am I doing wrong?	I'm trying to housebreak my Cocker Spaniel and he's currently 5 months. Is it too late?       Well anyways, I feed him and I wait about an hour and I walk him outside for an hour and he doesn't pee or poo anywhere. So I figure he's not going to do it yet, so I go back home and a seconds later he pees and poos on my floor. I don't get it. Why is he doing this? Is it because he's smelling his urine on the ground previously?

20090203101413AABeHjf	Pets;Cats	Why does my cat do this? Is this normal?	I have a question about my cat, Kitty. We have known for years she has had odd traits, including this one.       Where Kitty and my other cat Princess eat is in front of a video shelf, or a bookshelf holding videos. In it is a bunch of papers that stick out of it. Before eating, my cat Kitty scratches at those papers with her paw and I think with her claws too.      And there's more.      After she eats, she sometimes scratches the tiled floor too that is near their eating area. Now I ask whoever could help me, is this normal of a cat or is it just abnormal? Try to tell me as much as you could. Thank you in advance for any help given to me.
20090222194727AAu8Git	Pets;Dogs	What dog breed is the best?	My Girlfriend and I want to start looking for a puppy. We are looking at many breeds but we need some advice. I’ve asked this question before on answers but I never get a good answer. We want a small to medium dog (20-30 lbs…no more than that), with minimal shedding, good with kids, and slightly athletic. When I say slightly I mean that we would bring the dog for a walk everyday but we also go to the beach in the summer and want the dog to be energetic enough to do that but not too energetic in the house(actually a small apartment). What breeds do you recommend with a reason why? Thanks
20090222195240AAlC9Jz	Pets;Dogs	My dog is driving me CRAZY!?	I have a 4 year old pug and she has had a problem with going to the bathroom in the house, and if pooping she eats it. we think she eats it to not get in trouble with us because when we find out we scold her. i feel like we did everything we could, we have scolded her when she went potty inside, pushed her nose in it (which i dont think she cares that much because she dosent mind eating it..), given her treats when she went to the bathroom outside (which, when we did this she just started going pee 3 times so she would get 2 extra treats after each one..). shes a smart dog but she is 4 years old and today (she usually goes to the bathroom in the kitchen) she went on the wood floor! that just made me mad and i HAVE to do something about this but i dont know how! today and yesterday i had her on a leash with me 24/7 and she even managed to go to the bathroom in the house DURING that time!! I decided to try a new tactic and leashed her up to a door to make her sit by herself for 5 minutes. i just dont know what to do anymore. do you have any other ideas of what i can do? i would appreciate other peoples input so much because im running out of ideas. we also have an issue with her barking uncontrollably, and agressively chasing the family bird (but i would rather focus on the potty issue). the other thing is, that she can stay in her crate for 8 hours when we are at school and can hold her bathroom and yet 30 minutes after eating dinner she poops in the house! and its not like we take her out of her cage after 8 hours and she poops, its like we take her out of her cage, bring her potty outside, 5 minutes later she eats dinner and in a half hour she poops/ pees again!! any thoughts/ideas/insight please?

At home I usually cover his cage at around 9:00-9:30, and on weekends 10:00-10:30. We play with him a lot and he is a Sun Conure. What procedures should I take in order to make him feel comfortable and safe? It is only a 2 hour drive. P.S. We own another house where we are traveling so I don't have to worry about having a place for him to stay.
