A bicycle wheel is rotating at 49 rpm when the cyclist beings to pedal harder, giving the wheel a constant angular acceleration of .40 rads/s^2      What is the wheels angular velocity in rpm, 15 seconds later?      Also How many revolutions does the wheel make during this time?      i got this but do not know what to do after to solve for the angular velocity and How many revolutions does the wheel make during this time?      A radian is a unit of 2pi, since a circle is 2pi all the way around.    So Rotations per minute =49   Each rotations is 2pi so   radians per minute = 2pi(49), or 98pi   60 seconds in a minute so,   Radians per second = 98pi/60      Velocity = Initial veloicity + acceleration x time (works for anysystem)   Initial V = 98pi/60   Acc = .40   time = 15      98pi/60 + .4(15) = final speed

Paul is an apple grower in central Georgia and wants to expand his apple orchard. In her current orchard, there are 25 trees per acre and the average yield per tree is 500 apples.Data from the local agricultural experiment station indicates that if Paula plants more than 25 trees per acre, once the trees are in production, the average yeild of 600 apples per tree will decrease by 10 for each tree over 25. She needs to decide how many trees to plant in the new section of the orchard. Throughout this task assume that, for all apples growers in this area, the average yield is 500 apples per tree when 25 trees per acre are planted and that this yield will decrease by 10 apples per tree for each additional tree per acre.

20090220190227AA7pzef	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	How do you get the perimeter from the square?	Area of a square is 324.      Whats the perimeter?      My friend thought that 324/2= the two sides multiplied to get the area. but that's wrong, because you only found half of the number...and to get 324 with those two numbers 81 and 81 would be to ADD THEM together... but you don't get the area of a square by adding two sides..you NEED TO MULTIPLY the both sides. Sure If the area was 6561 then yes 81 would be the two sides.. and the perimeter 81x4.. would be 324. But in this case the AREA is 324.. and the perimeter is 18.. because 18x18 is 324 (area) and 18x4 (perimeter) is the answer B.72 in      So I choose to divide the square by 72 (because it was one of the answer options). Which gave me 18. So to make sure it would give me the correct area of 324 I multiplied    18x18 and got the correct area of 324.       My question is.. is it possible to have found the perimeter of the square by using another strategy? Like if there were no answer options? If so how?       Thank You

20090220185832AAfha0T	Science & Mathematics;Physics	P=VI, which student is correct?	Two students are discussing how to produce more power in a circuit.    'P=VI', says Tom. 'Since V = IR, P=I^2 R. This shows that power is proportional to resistance. Therefore, if I want more power from a supply I should use a bigger resistance'      'I don't agree' says Josh.'It is true that P=VI, but ohm's law gives I=V/R. This means that P=V^2 / R , in which case power is proportional to the inverse of resistance. If  I want to draw more power from a supply, I would use a smaller resistance.' Which student is correct, and under what circumstances is he/she corrrect?

20090203103147AAPQNpS	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Poll: I want to clear up this 2012 nonsense and get as many yes/no's on whether they think its going to happen?	Alright this may be a little lengthy but bare with me here. There are many arguments that go against this whole 2012 thing.      1. From what I have done research on, the mayans intended it to be a new age (besides were they really suppose to make a calender that lasts forever?)   2. Nostradamous actually predicted that the world would actually end in 3447 B.C. or something close to that period. And everything that he says is so vague that it can mean relatively anything and people have twisted his words to make it sound realistic.   3. The episodes on the History Channel are thriving off of gullible people to watch their channel and produce income and use it to profit off people. If it was going to happen, why would they try and make money off of it?   4. For those Nibiru or Planet X believers, if it were true then we would have been able to spot it by now when they sent out satellites to jupiter.       -Also anyone who has been following this story, should know that it was invented by an outrageous author Zeccharia Sinchin and in his book stated that aliens have created humans on this planet Nibiru and are coming back     - Also if anyone remembers the story, this planet was suppose to arrive back in 2003 in like March or Springtime. When it didn't come these people decided to attach it to the next event which happened to be 2012. Also another story i've read since i decide not to read his books is that he estimated the return of this planet in 2085 which will complete its 3600 year orbit.   6. About the whole thing on the IHC and the lottery that has been seen my millions if not billions of people on the myspace website is another desperate way for money, marketing and getting rich of this hoax. The IHC is a Sony Productions website that is trying to get people scared to watch the movie that is being released in Nov. 2009 by the same guy who produced 10,000 B.C. and Independence Day (Both Sci-Fi and fictional movies, sound about the same right!?) Sony is just promoting the movie with this site and you can click "Private Policy" on the site to see that it is a Sony website about the upcoming movie.   7. The whole theory about the galactical alignment has also had its stories. Their will be a transit of Venus in that year and that has happened all the time. Their wont be any real planetary alignments and you can use any space program to find that it is something like 6.5 degrees off from the sun.(This is what I heard as I am not an astronomer by any means) Also, it is said that the last one has taken place in the year 2005 and it will be only 0.1% off from where it was in 2005, and nothing happened then did it?!?!? Also, their is no known scientists that believed anything catastrophic is going to happen when this happens.    8. The whole poles shifting thing is quite far out to regarding that it has proven by scientists by using the oceans floor to say that the poles have shifted before but it takes thousands, if not tens of thousands of years to do so. And this magnetic pull would have to be something extraordinary to accomplish this and since its only going to be 0.1% different, how is that going to happen?      After all of this, is there really any explanation that can truly point that something is going to happen? There are so many theories that get made up each day by different people to try and make people watch these shows or buy their books and profit off of it. IF it were real, why would the money matter to this people? Their stuff should be free.   **Also I think this stuff is targeted to the younger audience such as adolescents because they havent experienced a scare like this as much grown ups have during their life time. Remember Y2K, and supposably my Professor said same thing about 1988 and some other years. It's my opinion that these people make up these scary things to every 10-15 years or shorter to scare the "new generation". And for all you people who think the government or some thing like NASA is hiding it, 1st off, the government wouldn't let Sony promote this idea on such a popular website as Myspace and let alone let them come out with a movie!! Plus if Nasa has already warned us about Appophis in the year 2029(which is said to only have a 1/45,000 chance to happen), why wouldnt they have warned us about this years ago or some other space station? Plus most of you have forgotten this or never knew this, the internet was first created by the government back in 1970 or so!!!! It is just sad to see that almost anyone can make any website and come up with lies these days and post unreal videos on youtube, look at all the magic and optical illusions that can be done, its truly amazing. What's going to happen is that young children and teens are going to be frightened and some may actually do things such as suicide or max spending and get behind financially. It is just one big  marketing thing and its sad the extremes people and businesses(like sony who is desparetly in need of money) will go to for

20090220212233AA7Iyf3	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Tangent -  Not HOW to do it, but what it actually IS??? HEllppp..!?	OKay, so this is really confusing me. And im not sure exactly how im supposed to explain it. We are just learning tangent as it has to do with basic right angle. And i get HOW you get the answer. I know how to do it for the test. What i dont understand is what that number actually is.      So, Lets say that you are trying to find angle A. You know that the opposite leg equals 15 and that the adjacent leg equals 8. You can divide that out and get 1.875. Then, you type that into the calculator and it gives you 61.92751... which rounds to 62 and thats the answer. BUT my question is.. how does the calculator get from the 1.875 to the 61.92751???      I asked my teacher this, and she either didnt get the question, didnt know and wouldnt ADMIT it, or just didnt want to tell us at all, i have no idea. But she couldnt answer it. My thing is that there has to be an equation or something that the calculator has that gives you this number. I mean, im sure that it is a very long hard equation that no one wants to do WITHOUT a calculator but still, i just need to know what that number is. I have a block on this subject until i figure that out.      Does anyone know? If you need me to elaborate on the question, just tell me. Thank you!

Here is the website with a brief description of what the documentary is about:       http://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/doczone/...       So it basically is talking about how certain chemicals that are around us every day are affecting the male reproductive system in humans and in animals. Here are some of the facts that they list:      Facts about Male Infertility      * Sperm counts have been cut in half in the last fifty years - and 85% of that is abnormal.      * In the last few decades there has been a 200% increase in male genital birth defects.      * Male birth rates have declined. Since 1970 there have been nearly 3 million fewer baby boys.      I watched some of the documentary and it makes sense to me but it's really disturbing.

20090219154107AAb7nxv	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	ANSWER FAST PLEASE! HELP!?	My best guy friend of two years didn't invite me to his birthday party. Like, a month ago, he was telling me all about it and what his plans were for his party. A couple of days ago, I saw him handing out invitations at school, and I kindof slowly walked by, waiting for him to see me and hand me one...he didn't..   We have different friends and we're in different grades, but still we manage to spend time with each other, text, and have small talk at school.    He invited me to his birthday party last year, and he even asked if I wanted to stay over longer and go out and have fun for a bit. Even when his girlfriend went home. Seriously, we're really close like that. He's always told me that he really cares about me, loves me, and compliments me all the time. I thought we were good buddies.   But when I heard that he didn't invite me, it really, really broke my heart.   If he decides to talk to me at school or text me a "Hey" in the future, what should I say to him? I really want to make sure he never forgets what I say, no matter what I DO say.      Additional Details   And I want to wait for him to talk to me, to see if he completely wants me out of his life. That way, I could get the hint without even bothering him.    But I also know that not talking to him could kill him, if he's still the same person. If he really cares, he'll talk to me, but I know he won't bring up the conversation about why he didn't. Being a guy, he'll hope I've forgotten. So I need something powerful to say to him.

20090219160746AAHVP6b	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Confirmation needed. Trigonometry?	Here are the questions I have just done, I also have provided the answers that I came up with. If someone with knowledge of trig could confirm my work it would be appreciated.       1) A summer carnival involves a triathlon that involves a 2km wheel barrow race, a 3km three legged race and a potato sack race. How long is the potato sack race.       The question shows a triangle on the left side of the triangle it says Potato sack race. On the right side it says Wheelbarrow race and on the bottom it says three legged race.       Just below the wheel barrow race side it says angle is 40*.      The answer that I came up with is 1.95km         2) Two ships left hudson bay at 40* apart. One travelled at 16km/h the other travelled at 14km/h. How far apart are they after two hours.      The answer I came up with is 20.86km         3) A field in the shape of a triangle, ABC is surveyed. It is found that side AB is 580m, angle A is 51.3* and angle B is 58.2*. Find the perimeter of this field.      My answer came to 1580.83m      4) There are two hotels on an island separated by 500m. There is a hovercraft that which takes people from a dock to the hotels. How far is each hotel to the dock?      At the base of the triangle is 500m. Also both lower angles are 36* on the left and 59* on the right.       The answer I came up with for each was.       Hotel #1 was 430.19m from the dock.    Hotel #2 was 295.01m from the dock.
