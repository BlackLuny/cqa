Today we had our first difficult track practice for outdoor and i noticed that my toe felt weird and so i took off my shoe and there was blood.      The toe was purple closed to the inside in indoor, and it progressively moved outward like i heard it should,      My coach told me to put neosporin on it and bandage it,    So what im asking is when will it be normal again b/c it feels really weird and when can i run again,   The more you guys write the better even on things that i didn't mention since this is the first time that it has happened to me, b/c i always read everything and choose the best answer   so thanks guys and ladies   :)
20090307080658AA7RQ63	Sports;Tennis	How to handle annoying players who puts spin?	I use top spin for forehands and top spins and slice (sometimes) for backhands. Now I always face these annoying defensive baseliners who lob the ball every single time or they just slices the ball. The ball flies 10ft lands and bounces in a different direction.

Right now David Villa is playing for Valencia, and don't get me wrong Valencia isn't at all a bad team, but it's mediocre. I would think that Villa, being the starting striker on the Spain national team, would have tons of great teams wanting him on their roster. Torres, the backup striker plays for Liverpool, and he doesn't even have the starting position. What is the reason that Villa has settled for Valencia? I'm sure he's recieved tons of offers elsewhere with a higher level of play. Does he not want a higher level right now, or is their something I'm missing?

Me and my boss have a bet going that Kentucky will not make the tourney in 2009 but he (being from Kentucky {obviously}) swears that they will on his mother's life. So the question is posed will they make the tournament this year. Will they make it just on collegiate prestige or will the NCAA see that this would be looked upon with frowns as the people know their bid was just a money scheme? Or do you honestly think UK has a real chance at winning? I don't think it is possible and he continues to say they will make it just because they are Kentucky "We are KENTUCKY and you are not!" is his continous statement, he thinks they will get in on prestige. You decide and give me more ammo or bust on this hot debate

20090307073616AANo1Sc	Sports;Wrestling	Who thinks CM Punk will lose the IC Championship to JBL next week? *Contains RAW Script from 3/2/09*?	Here's the first draft copy for the Punk/JBL segment but did not take place because there wan't enough time:      * JBL Music and Entrance (in white limo)      * JBL Promo: Shawn Michaels isn't the only one with WrestleMania aspirations. I believe it is my destiny to do something historic on April 5th and after watching clips of Steamboat last week, I now know what it is — walk into my home state of Texas as the NEW Intercontinental Champion. I will bring honor and prestige back to that Title and have what will become the greatest Intercontinental title match of all time. Earlier tonight I went to Vickie Guerrero who told me if I could beat CM Punk in a Non-Title Match tonight; I'd face him for the Title next week. That is what you call controlling your own destiny — something most people including everyone here don't have the backbone to do. Like it or not, you will all be witnesses to the first chapter of my TRUE destiny when I face CM Punk and...      * CM Punk Music and Entrance      * Crash to Break      +3:00=      DURING THE BREAK: MATCH BEGINS      Segment Five: CM Punk vs. JBL - Non-Title Match   Producer: Mike Rotunda   Time:      * Match joined in progress      * Finish — DQ      * Lilian Garcia Announcement — WINNER of the match due to a disqualification — John "Bradshaw" Layfield      * JBL celebrates   * JBL music out   ______________________________________...      This will probably happen next week instead and the week after JBL will win the IC Championship since Punk is in the MiTB, this year.      WQ: Do you think this will happen? ^^^   WQ: Who will JBL defend the IC Championship against at WM 25?

I thought it was just TV announcers not knowing what they were talking about as usual. Then I read an artical that said the NCAA made them change the name because the name 'shootout' supposedly glorifies war or something. Is that the dumbest crap you ever heard? it also mentioned the Georgia/Florida game no longer being billed as 'The world's largest outdoor cocktail party'. I though that was the coolest name of all rivalry games! This kinda crap just pisses me off to no end!

Or is it because he played for Athletico?        Finally, are you hoping Liverpool beat Real?  Thanks. :]

20090307085438AAe0S7X	Sports;Wrestling	Would anybody else like to see the WWE release a Best Of WarGames DVD?	For those who don't know WarGames was a gimmick match first used in the NWA and later in WCW:      The WarGames match consisted of two teams of either four or five men each facing off with each other in staggered entry format.      The setup of the cage consisted of two rings side by side with a giant ring-encompassing cage that covered both rings, but not the ringside area. Doors were placed at far corners of the rectangular cage so the two teams didn't come into contact before they were supposed to.      The match began with one member of each team entering the cage. After five minutes, a member from one of the teams (theoretically determined by coin toss, but always the heel team) would enter the cage, giving his team the temporary handicap advantage. After two minutes, a member from the other team would enter to even the odds. Entrants alternated between teams every two minutes, giving the coin toss-winning team the temporary advantage in the numbers game before giving the other team the advantage with the freshest man and even odds.      Once all eight or ten men (depending on team size) had entered the cage, what was referred to as "the match beyond" began. Both teams would brawl in the cage for as long as it took until a member of either team submitted, surrendered, or was knocked unconscious. There was no pinfall and no disqualification, which often led to brutal and bloody confrontations.

Friends,      Here is something I recently read in a cricket-blog:      "It's Official: Sachin and ICL Cannot Gel :      The BCCI has fallen flat on its face once again, and yet again ICL, despite cancelling its World Series, continues to be a thorn in the flesh.   Sachin Tendulkar was poised to play alongside the NZCPA (New Zealand Cricket Players Association) in a Masters Twenty20 match today. But as stated yesterday, problems surfaced when the BCCI “discovered” Hamish Marshall, one of the players for the ICL’s Royal Bengal Tigers was also scheduled to feature, they began to squirm.      Today Sachin did not play, as didn’t Dinesh Karthik, predictably for BCCI’s uneasy stand over mingling with ICL players, present or past.   That the BCCI can no longer impartially resolve ICL’s issues means that the ICC will have to play a greater role. Only problem - there are too many Indian (read BCCI) affiliated members within the ICC to let this matter work itself smoothly! "      Is ICL guilty of malpractise?      or do they practise aparthied?      or do the players in the ICL have some communicable disease?      Rehman of Multan

20090307085522AAmyebK	Sports;Tennis	How do you volley??!!!!!!?	I suck at volleys. My serves and ground strokes are great but I can never volley. This really hurts me (even more in doubles). Once the vultures see I make mistakes with volleys they attack and always hit the ball at me. Also in singles I am forced to play the baseline due to my weakness in volleys.      What usually happens is the ball goes off court or too high when I volley. It should be low and hard so the return has to be diffcult, but my volleys go upwards. This is probably due to the face being too high.      Sometimes I lose my grip when a hard ball hits the raquet and it just loses direction.      Any helpful tips?

Thanks so much if anyone can help me.

Right now, after the way Wade has been playing,  and James having an off night against the Celtics, I think Wade has to prove that he should be MVP by winning in Cleveland, the toughest place to play in the NBA, with an incredible all-around game. If he can come really close or even win, I will personally make him my number 1 MVP for now.

20090307092630AAyxEsI	Sports;Wrestling	Does anyone else think that WWE these days are lacking good superstars compared to 5-10 years ago?	back the u had the rock, stone cold, DX (i know they r still there kinda thing), brock lesner, goldberg, brett hart, eddie geurrero, chris benoit, kurt angel, etc etc etc.      even wrestlers like chris jericho and shawn michaels were better back then.       i mean, now u have sub-standard super stars like CM Punk, Kofi Kingston, etc...      even the likes of edge, batista, etc dont have the same charisma and effect as the WWE superstars from the last 5-10 years.   the standards of WWE superstars has serverely dropped.    does anyone agree with me?

And so what if we didn't make the playoffs, a lot of other teams didn't make the playoffs either.     The Patriots are a great team with great fans, and anyone who is a fan of football shouldn't make fun of any other team, that is stupid, anyone who makes fun of another team constantly shouldn't even be allowed to watch football, that's just stupid and immature.

20090307095745AA5Zwta	Sports;Running	First Track Scrimmage?	We have our first track scrimmage this Friday. It's my first year of track and I'm a freshman,  but I'm really nervous. We've only been practicing for a week! I'm trying Javelin, although I want to do sprints too and 3/4 of the throwers pretty much has no clue how to throw the jav yet. So my question is, what will the scrimmage be like? Will everyone else be really good?

Also tell me a team that was bad last year that you think will be decent or better this year.      My Letdown Team: Eagles. NFC champion-runners-up are completely falling apart. they might struggle to make .500 next year.      My Surprise Team: Saints. With the statistically best QB in the league, I just don't know how they can possibly be so bad. I think they'll get their act together this season. They'll probably still miss the playoffs but they'll be a hell of a lot better than they were this year.
