How do you work out the gradient by knowing the x intercept (-1/3) and the y intercept (1).   The answer is 3.      However, I dont know how to get to this answer.      I know how to do it if the x intercept wasnt a fraction, but I dont know how to work it out with a fraction.      Usually I would just use rise/run or y2-y1/x2-x1.

Bees are the number one pollinators of this world. Without bees most plants will die out. This means we will lose a lot of crops. The animals that eat plants will die out and we will lose that food source too. Also plants are the only thing giving us oxygen so that will severely limit the oxygen we have. The bible also mentions bees dieing out being a sign of the ends of time. What's your opinion?

Would it be cost effective to manufacture the box with two switches, two controllers, or two of both? would it reduce the replacement costs enough to justify the extra manufacturing cost?      each switch costs $1.38   each receiver costs $2.04   the box alone with no additional components is $19.57   Replacing a defective box costs $9.81 for shipping as well as the original cost of the box   A defective box's scrap material is worth $1.88      cost figures are needed on a per unit basis

I had this question in my final Grade 12 exam and I solved but faced a little problem with it    Please tell me if it is a difficult problem to solve   A-  Two fair dice, each having six faces numbered from 1 to 6, are rolled. Let  S   designate the sum                                         of  the numbers on the two appearing faces,  and consider the following events:            H  : ? the sum S is greater than or equal to  8 ?,            C  : ? the sum S is less than or equal to 5 ?,            E  : ? the sum S is equal to 6 or 7 ?.            Show that the probability  P(H)=5/12  and  calculate  P(C)  and  P(E).         B-  1) At a " Kermes " organized at the end of the school year, a students is in charge of a '' stand ''  at                    which the following game is proposed:                    The player rolls two fair dice each having six faces numbered from 1 to 6.    ? If he gets a sum greater than or equal to 8, then he draws randomly one ticket                                 from a bag that contains 30 tickets out of which  20 win.   ? If he gets a sum less than or equal to  5,  then he draws randomly one ticket                                 from another bag that contains 30 tickets  out of which  10 win.   ? But if the player gets a sum equal to 6 or 7, then he chooses randomly  one                                              of the two bags and draws a ticket at random from the chosen bag.          Designate by G the event: ? the player wins a prize ?.   a- Calculate the probability that the player draws a winning ticket  knowing that he                                          got a sum   greater than or  equal to  8. Deduce  P(H∩G).            b-   Show that  P(E∩G) = 11/72 .            c-   Calculate P(C∩G); then  deduce the probability  P(G) that the player draws a winning ticket.         2)  The school administration announced that "everybody wins". To achieve this they decided                                               to give to every  player who draws a winning ticket the amount of 5000 LL,                                                                        and to every player who draws a non-winning ticket the amount of:    ? 3000 LL  if he realizes the event H and does not win,   ? 2000 LL if he realizes the event C and does not win,   ? 1000 LL if he realizes the event E and does not win.       Let X designate the random variable equal to the amount paid by the administration to a player.              Verify that P(X = 3000) =5/36   and determine the probability distribution for  X.

20090223045317AA71wcI	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Rate of anaerobic respiration as compared to aerobic respiration?	Hi, I'm doing my A2 Biology AQA coursework right now, and there is one issue that I am confused about. We are investigating the rate of respiration in yeast cells (saccharomyces cerevisiae - bread/baker's yeast) by measuring the rate of the production of carbon dioxide.      Anaerobic respiration involves the incomplete breakdown of glucose in the absence of oxygen, to release a very small amount of energy very quickly. Although aerobic respiration is more efficient than anaerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration is faster than aerobic respiration. Therefore, there are some issues that I am confused about as to the rates of respiration.      'Rate of reaction' is generally defined as being the amount of product formed over a set period of time. Although anaerobic respiration produces energy (and carbon dioxide) faster, aerobic respiration produces more energy (and carbon dioxide). Indeed, the equations for aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration (following the fermentation pathway) are as follows:      Aerobic Respiration:   Glucose + Oxygen = Carbon Dioxide + Water + 36 Moles ATP    C6H12O6 + 6O2 = 6CO2 + 6H2O + 36ATP      Anaerobic Respiration/Fermentation:   Glucose = Ethanol + Carbon Dioxide + 2 Moles ATP   C6H12O6 = 2C2H5OH + 2CO2 + 2ATP      As can be seen, carbon dioxide production is much lower in anaerobic respiration than in aerobic respiration. However, despite this, it is produced faster. Therefore, is the rate of anaerobic respiration higher compared to aerobic respiration or lower?

20090223072934AAyfdG1	Science & Mathematics;Physics	May I get some assistance in physics?	1) A force of 22  N is exerted horizontally on an 18 kg box to move it 7.6 m across the floor. If the box was initially at rest and is now moving at 3.2 m/s, calculate (a) the work done, (b) the final kinetic energy of the box, and (c) the engergy converted to thermal energy    due to friction      2) A 2.0 x 10^3 kg car accelerates from rest under the actions of two forces. One is a forward force of 1140 N provided by traction between the wheels and the road. The other is a 950 N resistive force due to various frictional forces. Use Newton's laws to determine how far the car must travel for its speed to reach 2.0 m/s

I mean, in the equation F=ma, both mass and acceleration are MULTIPLIED to get the net force, and yet ive read that it's only acceleration that's directly proportional to an object's net force. Isn't mass directly proportional to it too or am i missing something here.         (and im sorry if this seems like a dumb question to any of you)

A grating is labelled 500 lines per mm   1) Monochromtic light is aimed straight at the grating and is found to give a first order maximum at 15 degrees. Calculate the wavelength of the light source???   2) Calculate teh position of the first odrer maximum when red light of wavellength 730nm is shone directly at the grating??   3) The longest visible wavelength is that of red light with 1=750nm. The shortest visible wavelength is violet where 1=400nm. Use this information to calaculate the width of the angle into which the first order spectrum is spread out when white light is shone onto the grating??   Thank you soooo much if you can help!!
