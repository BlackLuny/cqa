I appreciate your courage.|`|vHQsz8HHaa	The holocaust never actually happened either.|`|Kggz7Eyiaa	Over 30 Palestinian civilians were killed, this is not in dispute. So something actually happened. You are really just attempting to argue semantics.     Try to be less of an idiot.    edit  ------------------------    "The particularly bitter answers to this question suggest to me that some people do not like being caught in a bald-faced lie! It's a weak spot in the Palestinian position, isn't it?"    You answered a question about Holocaust deniers earlier, you responded a little angrily, as did I. And rightfully so as like the Holocaust deniers you are trying to minimalize the deaths of innocent people. It is disgusting. Your own (bad) sources stated that over 30 civilians were killed, which disproves your original claim that nothing "actually happened". Geez, destroying your own argument is never a good idea lol.|`|JCiGDSyBaa	You are using extremely biased sources: Wiki and and Weekly Standard.|`|XZBTFnXiaa	its like saying holocaust never happened.

Great example to be setting.    Whether or not he trains six hours a day, 7 days a week using drugs is stupid and by him being photographed doing just that is stupid.    He is supposed to respect his body and you can have fun doing other things that dont put him in such situations.    He is a tool for doing it.|`|7d866ea2a2dff3d3d77ce1b12a4e11c8aa	They are making a big deal outta it, simply beacuse he is a role model.|`|v5YBydCGaa	American media unfortunately is very conservative.|`|u42chaAjaa	ya, its America, people smoke bongs on their porches, it just goes to show, how corrupt the country is becoming

More Native Americans died in the past couple hundred years than Jews in recorded history.|`|NMpbLtuTaa	Unstable people are always easily moved into the persecution of Jewish people.|`|J9RuKMPXaa	I agree with Neadus that one state solution is the only viable option at this point. Otherwise, Israeli Jews will one day "ethnically cleanse" Palestine and it would be lot more brutal than what we've seen in Gaza.|`|rIm9yUNfaa	Palestinians should fight back but with their current weapons they cant, All Muslim nations must arm Palestinians with advanced and powerful weapons.

GOD will prevail in the in|`|Ij02BDygaa	Im glad your seeing the truth,    No they should definitely not give up, They should keep fighting for there land, I hate violence but they need to fight the good fight, Israeli government and there agenda is just evil, Not the people of Israel but there government, The people themselves are brainwashed by the media, They dont even get the full story. Same as American media dont show the truth so Americans are brainwashed into believing Israel are the good guys.    13 Israeli killed by the 8000 or so Hamas rockets in 8 years (Not Iranian rockets but they wont you to believe this "Iran make better rockets" )    And about this God gave them the land thing, Well listen, The Bible is written by Man, Men in power took what they wanted from the writings and put it together in a way that would put people in order. The word of the bible is not fact. Jesus did not look like one of the BeeGee's.
80777048d03799df834091e205a246d2aa	1) Some tests (toxic screens, etc.) do take days for results because of the way labs work and the double checking, more tests, etc. that are part of that process particularly for a coroner under a serious microscope with a case with such heavy media coverage.  They probably already "know" but are confirming/eliminating everything else before releasing anything for public consumption.    2) It clearly isn't Howard K's because why fight a DNA test otherwise.  Again, it is the fighting in courts, injunctions, etc. that have delayed even administering the test let alone the time for it to come back.  BUT, eventually this baby will be tested and the truth will come out.  I don't think the delays will last much longer.    3) I know she was estranged from members of her family but unfortunately that is who should get her body (her mom) given she has no other family AND assuming her will did not give that right over to someone else.    The moral of the story is keep your will up to date as your life changes particularly if you have strong opinions about things such as family members, etc.  I die tomorrow, I have no issues.  My husband gets everything (ain't much) and he will take care of funeral arrangements.  If I was divorced, my parents would step in.  If they pre-deceased me, my siblings would step in.  None of who which would be an issue. . .|`|d65a535f07c7b574b9c272c000e8c60caa	I guess some people never learn! The poor baby will probably never know who her real father is, and as far as Anna's burial that's going to court too! According to the "EXECXUTOR of her will... Mr.Brainiac... Everything goes to him and the baby! Who the hell says that? This will be a never ending saga!!|`|tUW0A9iPaa	Perhaps the mystery and confusion of the will lie in the atorney that wrote it --Howard K. I watched some of the court proceedings and I agree I(as ignorant as I am) could have made better decisions. The thing I keep thinking of is will the litle baby--who was not provided for--have anything left after attorney's fee from TX. CA., Fl, and the Bahamas? If the will was written 6 yrs earlier then someone (her attorney that drew it up) had a pre-pre-meditated reason to cut out any children that were to come. it is an amazing legal and social dilemma.|`|98624999e1c18432fab0aecedfa5129eaa	We all want to know those things.

52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	I guess I believe anyone more than the mainstream media.  I do believe that our country will fall from within and political correctness is one of our most dangerous enemies.  we have gone from common sense to total insanity.  Do you think that our founding fathers had any conception of what porn would be? Or that freedom of speech would be turned into what we have today. The only restrictions are the political correctness crap. You can use almost any words that are profanity but, you can't use the n word or j word. I prefer that those that use those words, do so. That way I can tell what kind of person that I'm dealing with.|`|wpoJvW3Yaa	i think that rush is brilliant and addresses many important issues in his talk show|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	Of course he is one-sided: he doesn't pretend to be otherwise.  That is his right [pun not intended, but apt anyway].   He tells it the way he sees it.  And yes, sometimes he jokes.  If people take his jokes seriously, well maybe they need a life.|`|aiX1ehAyaa	No...but like some have stated ..he plays off whatever to make his money. I wouldn't glorify him ... he is exactly what we do not need, a reversed ssa.|`|8tQ8JLO5aa	He is the logical counterpoint to the majority of media at this time in history.  If we ever end up with a media that actually reports in an unbiased manner, he will be lionized as someone who helped bring it about.|`|aGcRB3pyaa	I do not believe much if anything of what Rush Limbaugh says.|`|6FpUuLknaa	Rush is a fat, deaf, drug addict who makes over $40 million a year.  He's the American Dream.  Having a black man as the President, and Dems in control of Congress is the best thing that ever happened to him.  So many more people will tune into his show to hear what he has to say next that his power, wealth and waistline will expand so much he'll soon replace the moon as the largest object orbiting the Earth.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	No. But then, there have always been People who enjoy listening to Others "pass gas". So I'm not surprised He gets so much attention. From what I've heard- he has NOTHING to say... So I pay him no-never-mind...  :)|`|tkI7ZEccaa	i think he is very conservatively biased, just the same way I could easily tell you how biased NBC nightly news with brian williams, or BBC World News Hour is. It's all about the facts that you hide, and the way you manipulate facts to suit you're view. For example, the other night I was watching Fox News, and they were mentioning Al Gore talking to Congress about the stimulus package, saying how we need to pass this to help our environment, etc. They, of course show a short clip of him talking, and his main point, but then show the outside, and mention the current very cold temperature. Later on, out of curiosity, I turned on BBC world news. The do the same thing, show a little clip of Al Gore, then show a flooded river in Missouri, with a BBC woman going down with some other guy, and he tell's them how the levels of the river have risen, and how this and that used to be connected, what this looked like before, etc.|`|b3640707e483a3b444b16b298a3378aeaa	I don't think Limbaugh even believes all the stuff he says.     The man can laugh at times, but he does need a fact-checker.|`|AA11767291	Rush is brilliant and the rare time that he was wrong..he is man enough to own up. I guess some folks have a problem with the fact that Rush thinks the government shouldn't be running our lives..and the fact that we are all perfectly capable in doing so.

At least in the Middle East we know that throwing your shoes at someone is the ultimate form of disrespect. I have no idea what that means in China but I'm sure they want to generate the same amount of publicity. I doubt Obama will get his (and I hope no one tries) but there's always a Republican out there that's mad that they don't have control over the house anymore, so maybe soon.|`|a05fd8c8c066657df13bf7bdc2fdbcb9aa	Hmm...

It is a part of life.,

Being very social and having analytical mind we can just subsides it. We can keep terrorism very limited by meaningful discussions and by realising the factual situation & problem. Of course, at last terrorism has to handled with iron hand too.|`|u0jeosbOaa	NO not all.Spreading the teachings of great persons like Swami Vivekananda,Mahatma Gandhi etc and following them is th only solution.But those who do not want end terrorism doesn't allow this.|`|VVfDsNvvaa	Yes.

Government should take responsibility for free scientific education, food & job to everybody as per his qualification & capabilities.  Now economy is globalised.

Unless and until this economic system changes terrorism will present in separate form.  Change of economical system will give an end to terrorism.|`|NgtGJWdDaa	Simply put, there will always be terrorism.  The main reason is because it works and it works very well.    Think about it.

eFXD3Qzcaa	I think the woman is crazy!!!!  And I think the clinic should be punished.  To give some crazy woman who already has that many children an in vitro is just wrong.    And I completely agree with the first dragon.  She is a child hoarder.  It's frustrating how she has that many kids and still lives with her mom when there are so many couples out there who would love just ONE child, but can't have one.|`|046668252b7d273d3a4a3a6908a8607daa	She sounds as if she needs to be carted off to the local psych ward while her poor, poor kids need a good foster home with parents who actually put them first instead of seeing to their own selfish desires. She is clearly just out to get what she grab by coasting on her babies' 'fame'. I feel particularly sorry for the elder six, who will probably be shoved in the corner to make way for the octopulets (at least until she decides to have more kids).    I hope she gets nothing from private charities and the media. But, of course, she will be relying heavily on state benefits. I'm just glad she's American and not British. We have enough spongers of our own here without a woman with fourteen kids to support!|`|LSxBwiFSaa	I think the Lady has "Issues".

The woman is single and had six kids.  Many of you are assuming she has slept around a lot.  Maybe all the kids were invitro.  The woman had six boys and wanted a girl.  Fertility clinics routinely plant many embryos hoping one will produce a child.  In this case, all of them did.  Should she abort the rest even though she is against abortion?  Her father has said they have plenty of resources to take care of all of the children.  Who are you to judge that they shouldn't have them?  Why should she not ask the tabloids for millions of dollars for pictures of the kids?  Didn't Tom Cruise do it for his kids?  What makes this any different?      The bottom line is that she wanted to have one more child - a girl.  She ended up having 8.  She doesn't need anyone's permission.  So far she hasn't asked for anyone's help.   Don't judge others.|`|vvpiYDqSaa	What I think of her can't be posted... she is abusing a service that is there for those who need help conceiving... not freaks that want more welfare. Just cause she cant get a man doesn't mean she deserves fertility treatment... these facilities should be monitored cause it's all fine and well they take the money, but do we need more overcrowding due to blatent stupidity?

Oh yeah, and all of her children are from sperm donars.  I hate her.|`|oDr6p88Eaa	YES! It's crazy.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	She sounds like a child hoarder, doesn't she?  Well, I hope they have some talent; maybe they could support themselves as a family folk singing group, something like that.  In the meanwhile, it seems that California taxpayers are on the hook.|`|uZbDZOAJaa	You and the rest of the world that's following this story, me included. There are so many red flags. She's living at home with her Mom and it's just a small house in Whittier. I can't imagine that she can adequately take care of all of those children without strong support. It also seems like she's unlikely to get it because she didn't want to be identified. I was thinking she could really use the money from the slew of magazine and t.v. interviews she could have done. Also, then the community could pitch in if she would identify herself. Weird story.|`|fmlwD58iaa	no chance of her getting a man  imagine what 14 kids did to her, lol|`|2wsv8vz4aa	whoa whoa WHOA! who do you think you are talking about my mama like that?!?!?|`|kAvgkLxPaa	Do some of you read the news? All her children are from sperm donors. She didn't sleep around, as so many of you seem to think! And doctors said they planted far fewer than 8 embryos inside her - they multiplied because of all the fertility drugs she was taking. Which is quite expected. Doctors also said that they gave her the option of aborting some of the embryos, and later, the fetuses. But she decided to keep all of them.    However, I do agree that she has some psychological issues that need to be taken care of. It's not uncommon for each of us to be obsessed with something, but it's children and getting pregnant that she's obsessed with. She needs a psychiatrist. Let's hope she doesn't have anymore kids.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	It is grotesque and the doctors should lose their practice and the woman should have her tubes tied and be made to work full time to support her litter, why should the taxpayers have to pay for her idiocy? It is disgusting and her own mother thinks it is insane.|`|6FpUuLknaa	She probably is crazy.  Her own mother came out and said she was "child obsessed" and wished she would have just been a kindergarten teacher instead.  But the real question is what the hell was this fertility doctor thinking putting 8 embryos inside her.  That to me seems to  beimmoral, unethical, and could have been dangerous to the mother and small children, who are not out of the woods yet.  The doctor in charge should lose their license to practice medicine, and should be forced to help pick up the bill for these kids.  That will put in an end to over-fertilization.  If that doesn't happen, which it wont, this mother will have to really on sponsors for the money, like some magazine, or the gov't (tax payers) will pick up the tab.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I think that's SO crazy. 14 kids?! And apparently she doesn't have a partner.... so I wonder just how many men she has been with. I can only imagine how big she would have been pregnant with octuplets.     I also think it's ridiculous how she is asking for so much just because she can't seem to keep her legs closed.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation, so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.  But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicatewe can not consecratewe can not hallowthis ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before usthat from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotionthat we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vainthat this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedomand that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.|`|zwaCsOeVaa	All I've got to say is this:    Anybody who comes to try to take away my guns is leaving in a body-bag.

uB5pWzY8aa	The quality of education is measured differently by who's viewing what outcome. Because your first statement is correct, I would say that the government, media and education conglomerate is running quite nicely. If we had a society of people questioning the philosophies of our system we might have chaos.    In today's world a minority uses social engineering to create manufactured consent; subsequently the perception of common knowledge is being introduced by agendaists. Those minorities are made up by wealthy and influential families and organizations. Examples are not difficult to find and will be listed later. Foot soldiers for these elites have been for thousands of years, the easily lead and emotionally dedicated citizens.    To better understand how a small group can control what a larger group believes is truth, it maybe necessary to understand group think and cognitive dissonance or compartmentalized thinking. First it is imperative that a historical understanding of media consolidation is reached. Going back to 1921 we can pinpoint the start of American media manipulation by special interest group mergers.     These mergers were and are being facilitated by agendasits that served and serve as board members in several different organizations but the most well known maybe the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). The CFR was founded and still largely controlled by International bankers, Wall Street lawyers and wealthy old money families sometimes called the Establishment or the Elites. Among the CFRs founders were JP Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, Colonel Edward House (Marxist. globalist and close advisor to President Wilson), Paul Warburg (international banker), Otto Kahn and Jacob Schiff (both international investment bankers).    Nearly one hundred years later those banking families have used their money, power and presage to further propagate themselves in the political arena. The extent in which control over the distribution of information by these agendasits can again be followed back to March, 1915, when the J.P. Morgan interests got together 12 men high up in the newspaper world and employed them to select the most influential newspapers in the United States to control generally the policy of the daily press in the United States. They found it was only necessary to purchase the control of 25 of the greatest papers and so it was done. An editor was placed in each one and the processes have continued ever sense.     Here is a brief list of companies, and members. NBC, CBS, PBS, CNN, ABC-Disney, American-online, Time Warner, William F Buckley, Rupert Murdoch, BRZEZINSKI ZBIGNIEW, BIDEN JOSEPH, BUSH GEORGE H.W.     We are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time Magazine, and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during these years.     But, the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supernational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries.   Brother David Rockefeller - C.F.R. and Trilateral Commission Founder     These interests do not recognize political lines in the same manner as the public. The CFR for example is made up of wealth, power and politicians from not only both sides of the American political paradigm but from global interests.     Fundamental differences in philosophy and view of both economic and foreign policy do not exist at the top of our nations power pyramid. The leaders of government, labor, business, media, Or to reinforce my overall point, the Council on Foreign Relations may appear to have fierce and robust arguments from time to time, but fundamental questions regarding economy and the raging debates are nothing more than political theater. No major change comes without approval from the establishment|`|0c4e15c486b73273241480268ab82ce4aa	Are you truly this ignorant or it's just an act you put on here?|`|sagb3Q7Vaa	Want to put some percentages on your first question ?

Media generally keep us informed, moe than we want to be in some cases.  There are exaggerations on both sides of course and it may be hard for some to  understand the differences.  Others have vastly different ideas of what is best for our country but we work together and compromise most of the time.

Thousands of years ago the Mayans predicted a major celestial event in December of 2012.    The fictional film is about the science behind this eventful happening. There are several theories-none of which have been proven, but thought on upon for centuries by educated people.

In reality, impotent cowards like Rush Limbaugh use it to make sure some intelligent caller with an opposing view or facts to disprove the stuff he makes up doesn't one-up him on the air and threaten his authenticity, or lack therof, or make him appear stupid to his dwindling listener base.     In most other case, it minimizes opportunities for crackpots and whackos of all flavors to spew FCC-forbidden vitriol over the airwaves, scarring the innocent for life.  ;)

Why couldn't they have just made her clean up graffiti for 6 months or something first and then if she did it again, then she should serve jail time?  I think jails should not be used for every crime - they should come up with some imaginative punishments that really make someone think before they do it again.  Sitting in jail doesn't teach them much about what it takes to clean up graffiti or whatever else they have done.  Just my opinion!|`|jto3YOQJaa	I just think that this decision sort of came out of nowhere, what else has the government done that has eventually gathered momentum and led up to this issue? apart from spending millions of dollars on it every year...    but i am FOR the movement, even tho that girl will never learn..

The 13 is also a bad number because of Friday the 13th....|`|AnFITvjtaa	no its a number between 12 & 14.|`|AA10837940	It could be.  It's possible that some gang somewhere in the world named themselves "13", but there's no way to know for sure.|`|OvLlvnRSaa	no, it brings bad luck.

The idea being, of course, that the dog will wind up biting Elizabeth, giving her rabies, and Elizabeth dying (there was no antidote to rabies in those days). However, the dog ends up simply running around loose and the assassins can't get it to stay in one place long enough for Elizabeth to come into the room, so they just let it stay loose and leave, hoping that Elizabeth and the dog will eventually end up in the same place and their plan will succeed. After a couple of days the assassin(s) return to Elizabeth's residence for a planned event. Upon entering the dog suddenly comes out of hiding, bites at least one of the assassins, and the assassin suddenly becomes the victim.|`|fcc97be1ae1addc02f0b674cef5d4949aa	Tickling her in the bath so she slips under the water and drowns.

vtMqmFjaaa	Exxon/Mobil had the highest profits of any company in history in 2008 (breaking the record they set themselves in 2007).    So I think the fact that we're giving them any money at all (let alone the friggin billions that we are) is pretty ridiculous.|`|2wsv8vz4aa	try kay for his and her.    works like a charmer.    holler.
Dunc379maa	I fully recommend that you do not subscribe to the New York Times as they are very close to declaring bankruptcy. They just borrowed over $200M from Carlos Slim, a non-American because no bank will lend to them money as they have been down graded to "junk" rating and they borrowed this money at a 18% interest rate which will put the Time right into the brink of disaster within one year. They also borrowed against their building and they are losing money by the day and three of the papers which they own, one the Boston Times, already went out of business so its not looking good. Therefore, don't spend a nickle on the New York Times. It is a rag and it deserves to end it publication once and for all.
zy8mKJxeaa	The nuts north of the 38th parallel are capable of starting a war and have little regard for human life. Hopefully South Korea is prepared to defend itself. The conflict has been simmering for so many years. Little did I think that it would still be going on now when I was stationed with the US Army on the DMZ in 1967-68.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Nope. No time soon.

6lO2RXu8aa	I'm not sure that this quite meets your criteria, but Will Bunch, of the Philadelphia Daily News, has a fine blog by the name of Attytood. I believe Susie Madrak who blogs at Suburban Guerrilla is also a professional journalist (or was; times have been tough lately). Hope that helps.|`|LNNJgF2Xaa	Joe Gandelman of the Moderate Voice is a ventriloquist, but he is also a former journalist.  I suggest looking to his blog.  He is also in contact with a lot of former journalists who now blog.
