283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	if they are digging that fiercely then you need to go to the vet as there could be other things going on, like maybe a yeast infection on top of the ear mites.<br>  <br>  Ear mite meds that I have used on my cats are eradimite and accarex. you may need to get some otomax from the vet (for yeast infections in the ear) and you will also have to treat the topical wounds on the backs of the ears with a wash of a 50/50 solution of peroxide and water and then pat dry and apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment every day.|`|4aAhEK9daa	There isn't.  The store treatments don't work and contain harsh pesticides that may make your cats very ill.  And DO NOT use them on the ferret.   The fact the infestation has gotten so bad that the cats are digging at their ears, bleeding and causing scabs is quite disturbing.  How long have you left them suffering with mites???  An untreated mite infestation can get so bad that it perforates the ear drum, causes secondary infections and even deafness.  It's NOT something you want to screw around with.<br>  <br>  Go to the vet and get a prescription for Revolution.  It works VERY quickly to kill ear mites and you can use it on the cats and the ferrets - just have the vet tell you how many cc's for each - it's based on weight.  One of my cats picked up mites from a friend's kitten when we were traveling together for a show and all six of my ferrets ended up with mites.  It only cost me about $5 per dose for the ferrets and $15 for the cat.<br>  <br>  It REALLY troubles me that you have a ferret and yet are asking for "other than vet" solutions.  How old is this ferret?  Are you aware that by the time they reach three or four lots of different diseases can rear their ugly heads - adrenal disease, lymphoma, insulinoma, cardiomyopathy?  And that with ferret vets few and far between treating them can be VERY expensive.  Has this ferret EVER been checked out by a vet?<br>  <br>  If you "can't afford" a vet then the best thing for all these animals would be to surrender them to a shelter.  Cats and ferrets both deserve owners that take care of things RIGHT AWAY - not one that leaves them suffering.|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Our cats had that, and we had to carefully clean out the inside of the ear (the black stuff) with a q-tip dipped in mineral oil, which you can buy almost everywhere.  We had to do that daily, and then we had a salve to put in the ear, also.  They might sell that at a petco.  Not sure.|`|0karW6fWaa	They sell otc ear mite meds for cats and dogs at petco, wm ETC..

I recommend wearing latex gloves when you do this.|`|XPO11i9Yaa	i bought an ointment type thing from my local pet store.. i put the ointment on a Q-tip and rubbed it GENTLY in my cats ears... did it for a week every other day and haven't had the problem sense|`|b3b3292f0a82969ceed4f00b38611bccaa	Hi there, You're going to need a vet in this case. Not to cure the cat per say... but to get you the meds you need. Also to confirm its mites not yeast. They can present similar, dark blackish red coffee ground type funk in the ears, and you need to be sure as treating for the wrong thing can make the condition worse. Some cats also just naturally have dark ear wax. It does not mean they have mites. So confirm it before you try to treat. <br>  <br>  Everything you ever needed to know can be found here but I’ll summarize for you. <br>  <a href="http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&S=0&C=0&A=664" rel="nofollow">http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content...</a><br>  <br>  There are only 2 meds that I have found to work 100% of the time on mites and I have tried them all, not to mention I have tried to treat naturally with every solution recommended over the years. Unfortunately, I have never had Revolution work on mites as the stand alone treatment either (maybe the mites are resistant here kinda like frontline works in some areas on fleas but advantage does not?), but it doesn’t hurt to use revolution anyway to get rid of any other bugs that could be infesting your cat. <br>  <br>  Also... cheap over the counter ear drops from a pet store and natural treatments are not effective like vet treatments and must be continued daily for 6 weeks daily. A mites life cycle is 3 weeks and then you have to treat at least another 3 weeks for any mites that may have hatched after the initial 3 weeks treatment. Just save your cat any further suffering and see your vet for the good stuff. <br>  <br>  You are going to want to get Accarexx or Milbemite from your vet. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.idexx.com/animalhealth/pharmaceuticals/acarexx/" rel="nofollow">http://www.idexx.com/animalhealth/pharma...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.milbemite.novartis.us/about/en/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.milbemite.novartis.us/about/e...</a><br>  <br>  Either one of these will stop your cats suffering very quickly. You just squeeze one little tube in each ear, one time. They are both a one time treatment and VERY effective. I have used them both effectively many, many times without fail. Neither requires ear cleaning before. However if the ears are really bad and filled with mite poop gunk... cleaning them can kill the mites quicker, hence stopping the suffering of the cat faster. <br>  <br>  Please don't hesitate in the treatment of mites. It's painful and can cause deafness and other painful problems if left untreated. <br>  <br>  Good luck! I hope you can get your kitty cured soon!|`|i94Vpk47aa	Um.. I am not sure how much i would use mineral oil but you could always clean their ears out with an over the counter ear cleaner (or even rubbing alcohol) on a cotton swab or Q-Tip, and you might be able to purchase something over the counter (from the vet) for the ear mites. We use a product called Otomite and you only have to apply it once a week, but you do need to clean their ears out before the medicine.|`|WNYLRQXYaa	Go to petland or petco and find out what would be best for your cat there. But the scabs are coming from your cat scratching it's ear too much.

L22hVXTIaa	Having her spayed may lessen some of her aggressive behavior.  But, when dogs are this aggressive, you almost always have to go with a professional trainer.|`|AM7CgQ4daa	It is part of the breed temperament, you should have thought of this before keeping the puppy.

aeonmRR2aa	For saltwater, you want actinic 10000K or 50/50; more focused on blue.<br>  <br>  For freshwater, you probably want full-spectrum 5000K to 6500K, closer to daylight (white), but particularly with red and blue.<br>  <br>  You don't need to spend a lot of money on lighting in a freshwater tank unless you want to grow plants.  So if you are not growing plants, just get a cheaper dual T8 tube hood, instead of a power-compact hood (those things are expensive to replace).  T5 is great but more expensive than T8.

Is this considered cruel?|`|qUeNrusdaa	It's only for appearance sake.  I would certainly NOT crop it's ears!!  However, you might consider cropping it's tail for a very real health/comfort reason:  At the humane society, we call it "happy tail".  "Happy Tail" is not a happy thing - when the dogs get excited and smack their tails against walls, tables, doors, etc., it can break the tails' bones and/or open lacerations on the tail's end.  This is painful to the dog and is not an attractive way to decorate your home's walls!  Dobbies are especially excitable dogs, so your dog will almost certainly suffer from happy tail.  I would suggest you discuss cropping it with your dog's vet while the dog is young.|`|t2M1kXY4aa	Traditionally, Dobes have had their ears cropped.<br>  <br>  Necessary?

At one time tails were docked for work reasons (Rottweilers in particular) but now there is no need and the American Kennel Club (your question suggests that you are American) needs to catch up and take cropping and docking off of its standards if that is where the problem lies.  Dobermans have beautiful ears ... don't do it.  As long as people keep conforming to the dictates of the show ring then this type of mutilation will continue unchecked.  Your question also suggests that you are not happy with the thought of cropping ears so follow your heart ....|`|wUg7iYU1aa	it's not necessary, but it is standard.. and in my opinion a Doberman just is not a Doberman unless it has cropped ears and a docked tail.|`|24249e5fba62567445c8e54b9df60520aa	No.  Cropping makes their ears sore for a short time and in my opinion it is done only for show.

ZxGAKWHQaa	The one Banfield with which I am familiar gives far too many vaccinations... the DHPP vaccine (which you want), bordatella (which I skip), and also the unnecessary corona, lyme, lepto, giardia, the vaccine which is supposed to prevent dental disease (which has not even been documented to work on dogs!). I do not know for certain if this is the practice at all Banfields, but I would guess that they have some sort of service quota they are supposed to meet for Petsmart, and that there is pressure to provide unnecessary services and treatments. If you want to go there to have the last of your pup's puppy series done, do it... but, you have the right to refuse vaccinations you don't want! You want to finish the DHPP series, and you want a single rabies vaccine sometime after your pup is four months old... anything else is not necessary, and vaccinations DO have the potential to cause harm... you want the fewest possible to keep your pup safe, and no extras! This is being smart, not being cheap.|`|AXcCyoo8aa	DON"T GO THERE! For some odd reason they feel because they are inside of Petsmart they can jack their prices up as much as they want because people will feel it's "convenient" to just go the the vet inside of Petsmart. When I first got my Toy Fox at 12 weeks I got her shots there and she also had an accident where she scratched her eye so they gave her a tube of eye cream....ya know how much they charged me...$400!!!!!! For shots and a tube of eye cream! At my new vet that would have costed $150-$200 TOPS.|`|24249e5fba62567445c8e54b9df60520aa	I can personally tell you I have had good luck using  a Bainfield location. I was headed to Canada and needed my dog's shots updated to avoid quarantine. You can check with the better business bureau or chamber of commerce in your area and see if there have been any complaints lodged against them.|`|DKQeGhBpaa	That's completely up to you.  You can also call a place like Petco and ask them about their shot clinics that don't charge quite as much, if finances are an issue.<br>  <br>  Also, you might check with your local Animal Control Department for information on shot clinics.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
p3vjvzRPaa	It would take a lot of information to answer your question fully, but a few ideas...<br>  <br>  First step is to select a dog with a good temperament to begin with if you can.  Bad temperaments can have a genetic component so worth considering the dogs that lie behind in the pedigree (and not just sire and dam).  Also, the early weeks of a pup's life are critical - they learn an awful lot from the interactions they have before you even take them home.  So, getting a pup from a breeder who has been diligent about the pup's early experiences helps a lot too, and you can also try to assess a pup's temperament before choosing them.<br>  <br>  Once you have a dog, there are a few things you can do...<br>  <br>  - Some puppy preschools take place in vet clinics.  They are WONDERFUL because the pups learn to look forward to going to the vet.<br>  <br>  - Some vets have a better 'bed side manner' than others so choose a vet that is good at taking the time to interact positively with the dogs.  I love vets who immediately interact with the dog instead of just talking to me, and then they stroke the dog while they're talking, and give the dog treats.  Good vets understand that it makes their job easier in the long run if they make the effort to make friends with the dog.  <br>  <br>  - You can put in some extra time to make your dog love vet clinics.  I had a dog who had to stay at a vet clinic for a day when she was about 5 months old, something happened and she was scared of vet clinics after that.  So I started taking her to the vet with me when I went with my other dogs - so she just hung out there and saw that her pals weren't stressed.  I also started spending time in the vet clinic waiting room with her - playing with her and giving her treats.  Of course I asked the clinic if they minded first, and I only went when the waiting room wasn't full.  I was just trying to build up lots of positive associations with the clinic in her mind.<br>  <br>  - make a point of making all your dog's trips to the vet as positive as possible.  A pup has to go to the vet for a few booster shots etc.  Don't rush through those appointments.  Take along toys or treats and  make the time fun - if pup is getting yummy treats or a toy while the vet is injecting them, they're less likely to develop a hatred of vets.  Talk to the vet about your concerns and ask them to make an extra effort.  A good vet will probably have a supply of treats anyway and be happy to help, but with some vets you may need to ask.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|d2b13247b0a080e166b6ef614a4f6a7daa	What I would do is bring the dog to the vet and have some really good treats that the dog only got when it went to the vet. Have the staff and vet give the dog treats, praise, and leave. Do that a few times a month maybe, and the dog will associate going to the vet with the special treats.|`|AM7CgQ4daa	it probably took after the jack russel,  they are 'take no ****' dogs,  a big personality in a little dog.   <br>  All you can do is carefully check out the breed or breeds that are in your future dogs.  some dogs tend more to aggressive,  others don't.  If possible check out the parents,  if the parents show aggression, keep looking. <br>  If you are rescuing and guessing at the dog breed/history,  all you can do is go by the advice of the rescue home.   If you get the pup young, then it is much easier to train him to be friendly and to be handled.   when you attend puppy school they recommend you get family and friends to give the pup an inspection,  feet, eyes, ears, throat.   If you make a habit of doing this and treating, the dog does not feel threatened by being touched.     If you dog or pup shows aggression, say no loudly, then when they stop growling or posturing, give them a treat, and keep treating and telling them how good they are until what is upsetting them ceases.|`|L22hVXTIaa	Obviously, having a dog that tries to bite your vet is not pleasant.  But, quite frankly, they're used to that.  It goes with the territory.  Once the vet knows that a dog is a 'snapper' they make a notation on their charts and they have the muzzle ready.  I'm sure in any given day, a vet is either bit, or scratched or in some way injured by one of his patients.  I know all my dogs hate going to the vet and usually put on the brakes as soon as they come through the front door.  No, they've never bitten, but they are so nervous they practically shake off my lap.  Rather than aggression, I think your little guy probably bit out of fear - sorry your mom didn't value him enough to try to have his problem corrected.|`|dWed21jUaa	LOL I was going to say, sounds like my JRT mix.<br>  <br>  Those dogs are nutty.

I voluntarily muzzled them because I didn't want to take the chance of my heathen monster dogs biting the vet or one of his techs.<br>  <br>  Since it was only a once a year occurrance (unless the dog got sick and had to be taken in), I didn't worry about "training the behavior."|`|AA11457471	If your mom took a 12 yr. old dog to a shelter I wouldn't even consider having another dog while you're living there SO... if you still live at home it's a moot point!<br>  That's REALLY cold!!!<br>  <br>  Add: I misread the age. My bad!<br>  <br>  Most dogs don't like going to the vet but don't attempt to bite. <br>  I'd suggest not making a big deal out of going to the vet. If you are tense or excited your dog will be, too.<br>  You can also take some irresistable treats like boiled chicken or small pieces of hot dog for the vet to give the dog.
Ik6WOcw3aa	Almost 100% incorrect.<br>  <br>  Bettas require more care than most people believe. Bettas need at least 2.5 gallons of water. All fish need filters, and since bettas are also tropical fish, they need a heater.<br>  <br>  Wild bettas live in rice patties and slow moving "creek things" (I dont know what to call them. They look like large creeks, but the water moves very slowly). Bettas developed a labyrinth organ which allows them to breath atmospheric air. But they dont use this all the time. They have it because warm water holds less oxygen.<br>  <br>  A long time ago people used to tell me they lived in puddles and little cups were fine for them. I did a little research, and realized that the "puddles" they lived in were rice patties that were miles long. Bettas are no different than other fish, and require the same care. Its just that they stay smaller and are fine with living alone that they get this horrible care.<br>  <br>  And with the male/female... The male would kill her. You need to feed them live or frozen food for two-three weeks in separate containers to get them ready to breed. Then you need at least a 10 gallon tank with divider, and put one on each side so they can get used to each other. You continue feeding live and frozen foods for at least a week. The female should develope dark vertical bars to signify her being ready. The male will build a bubble nest when he is ready. Then you remove the divider and you need to stay and observe them. If there is any aggression, you separate them. ANd once they lay the eggs, you remove the female, because the male will kill her. And once the babies can swim on their own, you remove the male, because he will eat them. Then you are left raising baby bettas and you then need a sponge filter so the babies dont get sucked into the filter.<br>  <br>  Its very difficult to breed bettas, and you need several tanks. What do you actually plan to do with the 100+ fry that youll end up having? The males will need to be separated, and the females cannot be crowded in tanks.<br>  <br>  Also, bettas can live just fine with other fish. At the moment I have about 8 female bettas in a 29 gallon tank with a school of bloodfin tetras and some cory cats. I also have a male shortfinned betta in with some serpae and lemon tetras (normally, this doesnt work, but since the betta in shortfinned, the tetras dont bother him). Ive also kept male bettas in with neon tetras and various other fish. The majority of the time, you have to worry about the betta. Most fish will actually kill the betta, not the other way around.|`|MPQI8Bg3aa	Not very...First of all, the fact that Bettas can survive living in a small bowl they by no means thrive. This is the reason many have such a short life span. You could probably survive living in a 3x3 room with rank air, but you sure wouldn't be happy about it...If you give them a tank with a heater and filtration they typically live a lot longer and are less prone to diseases like fin rot that run rampant in the captive population.<br>  <br>  As far as breeding your information is also incorrect. They need to be kept separated until they are actually ready to breed. As soon as they are done breeding they need to be separated again. If they are put together before they are ready to breed they can do serious harm to each other. <br>  <br>  While we're discussing Betta myths there's also a prevalent one that they must be kept by themselves. This is not true for most Bettas. Typically, as long as the fish you pair it with are not brightly colored and especially do not have long fins there are no issues. Occasionally, there are freak Bettas that will attack anything that moves but it is by no means the norm.|`|Yp15y9zRaa	no no no no no no no no! lol. Betta's should NOT be kept in tiny bowls or jars or vases. A betta in a home like that may survive, but will not be very active, their colours will be faded and they will be far more suseptible to disease. It's just plain cruel, and the fact that people treat animals in this way is just disgusting.<br>  <br>  They are tropical fish and should be kept with a heater as well. The ignorance of people who keep these fish with GOLDFISH is astounding.<br>  <br>  Also, both male and female bettas are agressive, keeping two together will result in death, and more than likely it'll be the male that dies. <br>  <br>  The website below is of a UK breeder, he has some useful info on the website that you may find helpful:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kgbettas.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kgbettas.co.uk/</a><br>  <br>  Please do not listen to whoever has given you this advice, they clearly know very little about keeping bettas. Please do some research before considering keeping one of these wonderful fish.|`|eq5qPnRGaa	Not so much.  Bettas are anabotanoids, so they can breathe atmospheric air, and this reduces their need for aeration/filtration.  They'll also tolerate a wider temperature range than many tropical fish.  They do fine in small tanks, but the water in the wild is anything but dirty.<br>  <br>  Just because you wouldn't drink it, doesn't make it dirty.  That water probably has many fewer chemical and heavy metal contaminants than your tapwater.  It also is full of beneficial compounds like tanins, which while they make the water yellow/brown they are natural germ fighters and excellent for the fish's health.<br>  <br>  Keeping bettas alive is not difficult, having them thrive let alone breed is quite another thing entirely.  Getting a breeding pair going requires a heaters, filters, insanely good water quality, and a lot of patience.  If you put the male and female together before they're ready to breed, they'll fight.  There's a lot of planning and timing involved.|`|xav4i5zkaa	I am the person who answered that question. In NO way shape of form did i tell you i knew a heck of a lot about bettas. YOU posted a a question saying this:<br>  <br>  How can i have a science fair project involvivg fish with out killing them and it has to be eco friendly?<br>  <br>  my answer was that you could base your project on mating bettas. You then came to me asking how, THEN you got this answer. <br>  <br>  I have ONE male and ONE female betta in a 30 gallon tank at my house. They have lived for 6 years. I have never purposely TRIED to breed them, they did that all on their own. NEVER did i tell you i was an expert. <br>  <br>  DO NOT email me again, and continue to harrasse me. I answered a question that you had based on personal experience, i didnt not tell you i was an expert. <br>  DO NOT try and slander my name on this site, you are being very childish and extremely rude. If you have a problem with any information i gave you then you take that up with me, you dont post it all over this site.<br>  <br>  good luck with your project and im sorry i ever tried to help you.
L22hVXTIaa	Obviously something was making him ill, but it could be that he's gotten it out of his system.

Are you still with me? So the buyer of the dog assumes or makes it out to be a mini because the dog happens to have been a runt or this new trend is getting into their mind, just as people call their dogs designer names. Goldendoodles for example.

Or does the pup just look the same?<br>  <br>  Many merle aussie puppies look alike. Unless it is the same exact picture, you can't really be certain.<br>  <br>  Not only that, but "mini" aussies can be as tall as the shortest permitted height of a breed standard australian shepherd. A "mini" aussie could technically be show quality. <br>  <br>  now, like you said, they are poorly bred. If that puppy really is from the same user, it could of been a runt of the litter. That user can't help what people call their pups. Besides, unless you are breeding specifically for mini aussies, it would be almost impossile to tell a pup's adult size. It's like guessing how big a human baby is going to get.<br>  <br>  I've seen people adopt runts from a litter and then call it "mini". They do it to make their dog look better.|`|AM7CgQ4daa	maybe the new owner calls it a Miniature as it was the smallest in the litter.    You could email the link to the breeder and ask her if it is the same breeder,  loads of puppies look similar.
GrYhFNMdaa	I have owned 3 and they are very independent. The are high energy and need guidance.  In my experience they are wonderful with children and make great pets. I had did have a bad situation were one of my huskies was shot by someone who thought she was a wolf. Just don't let them run freely without you around. But any dog is a great dog if you raise them right :) they are amazingly beautiful as well|`|AA11457471	Huskies are generally very independent dogs.<br>  Although they definitely bond with their owners they're about as loyal as a cat!<br>  <br>  I love the breed but if you are looking for a clingy, especially loyal dog, a Husky ain't gonna be it!|`|3BMBZtDxaa	I haven't own one personally, but have had experience with them.<br>  <br>  Huskies are very loving and affectionate! They are extremely loyal and can be "velcro" dogs as they say, but not all are. Every Husky I've met has come right up to give kisses! They generally aren't very good watch dogs because of this nature, and not to mention they don't bark a lot so basically if you're looking for a protective dog that will warn you of strangers or will chase off an attacker, they may not be for you. They do have the ability to protect themselves and family, and they will if they see a danger, but most likely they will be friendly to any stranger they meet.<br>  <br>  Huskies are extremely fond of their families, so yes, he will be loyal and attached to you.<br>  <br>  Let's see... they are known for destructive habits because most owners can't provide their exercise need. I mean, they're sled dogs so that's expected. They've been known to destroy the house while their owners are gone because of this! So it's good you understand that they need hours of extreme physical exercise for them to adapt well and not be destructive.<br>  <br>  Never let your Husky off leash in an unsecure area! Huskies love to run and roam, and by time they are worn out, they have no clue where they are. Next thing they know they see a person walking down the street, run up to them with a big grin on their face, and that person has a new dog! That's the worst part about owning a Husky, if they get out, most of the time you never see them again. Obviously there are cases where you do, but from what I've heard, you don't.<br>  <br>  Since they have such a high drive to run, I would suggest looking into local dog parks and see about finding places that are open and large where you feel comfortable letting them off-leash. If anything, find a large, grassy area and get one of those 50-100ft leashes so you can hold onto one end while the dog can run around on a tie. Maybe even tie two or three of the 100ft leashes together so it can get its maximum amount.<br>   <br>  Oh! Huskies are known for their stubborness! Well, technically, it's not stubborness. They are highly trainable if you are their leader and they respond to you, but if that isn't established forget it. That's where the stubborness thing comes from because many owners don't give them the exercise for them to listen and then they don't establish a pack order so the dog walks all over them. So be firm and consistant and be sure you can control a dominant nature in a dog. If you are nervous with yourself or you aren't a leader in groups of people, rethink your decision in a Husky. I would suggest being patient with training and be consistant as well. If you are their leader then training is extremely easy.<br>  <br>  Huskies are also extremely intellegent, so you have to mentally stimulate them as well as physically or else they will find their own way to! Having such an intellegent dog means they are great escape artists, can figure things out quickly, and can be destructive. So as well as those long hours of exercising and having them run, you must also find ways to tire them out mentally. Whether it be obedience training, sledding, agility, maybe a game of tug-of-war, but you must do something unless you want your sofa torn up! Chew toys are also great for mental stimulation. Kongs are your friend when it comes to Huskies!<br>  <br>  While Huskies can strive in hot settings, you don't want to work them in the heat because they can get too hot and can overheat. So if you live in a hotter area, try giving your dog exercise in the early morning and evening/night. No mid-day stuff!<br>  <br>  I almost forgot, Huskies are known diggers! You know how I said they are escape artists? Yes, they will dig under your fence and scale your wall. So you may want to make sure you have a secure yard and maybe invest in putting wire below your fence so they won't dig.<br>  <br>  On a last note, Huskies blow their coats twice a year. So tons of shedding! If you are a neat-freak, do not get a Husky. On average, they do shed a good amount, but when they blow their coats, it's everywhere! Plus, they need a fair amount of grooming with trimming their coats, but nothing fancy or bothersome.<br>  <br>  That's all the detail I can think of right now. If I come up with something else I'll edit it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|taLD45Sqaa	They are totally lovable and affectionate. As for loyal? Depends on your definition of that.... as in loyal, don't eat my entire yard and dig it to shreds, don't chew the side off my new area rug, don't break into the food box when I'm not looking, don't chase that Blue Heron down the beach when I recall you....then NO, they aren't! Whoever said they need guidance is absolutely correct! They need training and training and more training but they are smart and catch on quick, the problem is their stubbornness and keen ability to hear what and when they want. That's great to know you've done your research, many people cannot handle these dogs. It's not even so much about the exercise, that's the easy part. I just jope you don't like your yard that much and you plan on crate training and not planning on having an off leash dog... those are luxuries that you don't get! Good luck<br>  PS I hope you like dog hair and brushing.......|`|ebf709677c3120afa878acd9c1ce203faa	affectionate and lovable yes but loyal...not really unless you have food or treats in hand. Huskies are very intelligent, easy to train but stubborn and sneaky at the same time due to their high intelligence. when they listen to you, they can be really good dogs..it's like almost the perfect dog. Being the alpha leader is a must in order to handle huskies.|`|5d0588fa97d047676b038c38ba3e0cd3aa	These people should be able to help:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shwauk.org.uk/about_siberian_huskies.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.shwauk.org.uk/about_siberian_...</a><br>  <br>  I've also starred in the hope that Loki-Wolfchild will spot this question.

jwbLkaAoaa	I worked with three veterinarians for many years. Usually when a pet was brought in with cold like symptoms like sneezing and a runny nose it was one of two things conjunctivitis or allergies. Both are treated with one small clavamox pill cut in half once a day. You can usually get some from your pet store or your veterinarian.|`|L22hVXTIaa	More likely allergies or an upper respiratory problem.  Take her to the vet for a proper diagnosis and he will recommend something to alleviate her symptoms.  Never give a dog medicine until you know for sure what it is your medicating.|`|Sge1kfU6aa	maybe some piriton (dont know how to spell it) obviously the dog version, keep her out of dusty areas and keep phone the vet back for any other ideas they normally have the best ideas.|`|W02kTOqmaa	Well, seeing as how the flu is not a zootonic disease (a disease that spreads from humans to animals), this is VERY unlikely. As in, impossible. Your dog probably has an upper resperatory infection. Or kennel cough. Not a major illness, it's just like a human cold. One shot from the VET can cure it. Now, without treatment, it can easily kill your dog.<br>  <br>  Whatever your dog has, if it continues for a few days, it needs to be seen by a vet. Until then, not much you yourself can do. Human medications can not be given. You can take your dog in the bathroom with you when you take a shower. High heat and humidity help the mucus drain from your dogs nose. If you have a humidifer, run that as well.|`|J0N7KFTTaa	see vet.<br>  apply Vick's vaporub or put eucalyptus oil in hot water to relieve the symptoms.
L22hVXTIaa	The ol' vomiting and diarrhea combo are never good since it can quickly lead to dehydration which can be deadly in and of itself.  If it had only been the one episode last night, I would say he's probably okay.  But since he's still vomiting and having diarrhea today  - I would recommend that you get him in to see the vet.|`|AA11457471	As long as he acts like he's feeling alright & he's eating (& holding down at least some of it) I'd give it 48 hrs.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't clear in 2 days or he's vomiting often a trip to the vet is in order.|`|9kTejB0uaa	The reason it looks like a large amount is because complete food expands in the stomach (try adding some water to it and you will see how much it increases in size!).<br>  <br>  If this continues beyond 24 hours - and you'd do well to withhold food for 24 hours (assuming this isn't a puppy) in any case, you do need to get to a vet.  Make sure he keeps drinking however because dehydration is the biggest concern when it's coming out from both ends.  And even if this is only a 'simple tummy bug', the outflow needs to be shut down.  A small amount of yogurt can help with simple cases of tummy upset.  Any indication of deterioration should definitely mean a vet trip however!|`|GrYhFNMdaa	I would take him in if i were you. He could have ate something that's bothering him. Could have something stuck that's causing him to be sick. Could be a number of things. I also was afraid when my dog thru up one time and i thought it was a large amount. The vet brought in a small cut of water and spilled it on the floor. Man, did it ever look like alot more on the floor then what there actually was in the cup. I would get a vet check up to make sure your dog is okay.|`|J0N7KFTTaa	please take him to the vet,he may be suffering from intestinal worms.dont let it go,it may be dangerous in future 4 his health.|`|AA11426077	hmm, it may have just been something he ate. my lab used to eat socks and throw them back up and it would look like poop. she'd usually have loose bowels after that for a day or so after that- probably from the stress of it all. if the vomiting + diarrea lasts more than 3 days, i would go to the vet. our puppy was having diarrea but not throwing up and our vet told us when its both diarrea and throw up more than 3 days, there is reason for concern. but if one gets better, usually the other will follow suit close after and no worries. just monitor your doggie closely and take it from there :] good luck.|`|opvfzP7xaa	defiantly take him to a vet
iJtuhLMTaa	Sounds like you may have a mantis shrimp in the tank as they then to be active at night and will kill fish.   You can buy mantis shrimp traps as most fish specalty stores that carry saltwater fish or saltwater supplies.      If it is a mantis be careful in removing and handling them.  Their claws are quite strong and they are quick and can split a finger or your hand open very quickly if given the chance|`|qeOlkRM0aa	I agree with the poster above.<br>  If you have fish disappearing at night, you probably have a Mantis Shrimp, or possibly a predatory crab, but most likely a Mantis.They are frequent hitchhikers on live rock.<br>  Nasty  critters.You are going to have to catch him.|`|aeonmRR2aa	This is a minor possiblity, but if you have a lot of algae, perhaps there is suffocation at night?<br>  <br>  Without light, algae (including those in corals, and floating/planktonic autotrophs) stop photosynthesizing and produce carbon dioxide instead of oxygen.  In nature, this causes the huge dead zones at river deltas - a lack of oxygen, especially at night, caused by too many nutrients.<br>  <br>  I suggest you test your nitrates and phosphates (both should be close to zero).  And in the short term, increase aeration with a couple of bubblers or an additional powerhead that puts out bubbly water.|`|e3dad9cc3f217fc64b3369e29a929c0caa	Although I'm no fish expert, I'd say that the previous poster has a valid point.  My brother-in-law had a tank full of uber-expensive saltwater fish, then got a stupid $10 eel that ate all of his spendy fish!  Seriously, thousands of dollars of fish gone, to feed the cheap eel.  I would suggest taking a trip to your local pet/fish/aquarium supply store and tell the experts there what is going on.  Tell them all the fish that are in your tank and ask if they can get along.  They may be able to shed some light on your light problem... wish I could be of more help.  Good luck!|`|2weugn46aa	Maybe you have something that is attacking them at night, like a night predator fish.  Are they beat up when you find them?
1Qh9i9cWaa	Any plants will be fine, the more common being java ferns, amazon swords, etc.. These are fine in most lighting and really dont require co2 or iron enriched substrate.<br>  <br>  Anabuis nana is my personal favorite, it is rather expensive as plants go but worth the extra money. They are a hard leaf plant so fishes dont eat it, very forgiving.. Doesnt require anything.<br>  <br>  I still have some that are over 6 years old which is long for me!<br>  <br>  So they might be something to look into, they are a smaller forground plant so take that into consideration when planting. Remember to plant smaller plants in the front and taller plants in the back to give the tank depth.|`|wx2UfKOdaa	ya... u can use any aquatic plant... but my advice is if u have gold  fish... no plant will survive as they dig it and eat it... so its much cheaper and safer to have a money plant that is pothos which the gold for some reason will not eat.. give ur feedback|`|2weugn46aa	Almost any plant or moss will do fine if you have enough light, a filter that circulates the water, and do regular water changes.  Some plants are heartier than others and grow faster/slower, but in general any aquarium plant would do well.<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|qMO9S6kvaa	There are several species of plants you can add to your aquarium. I trust this site the most for fish and plants.

UdoLcwm4aa	She seeks guidance.|`|qUeNrusdaa	LOL  What breed?  How long have you had her?  And has she ever been aggressive towards you?  <br>  <br>  (Generally, direct eye contact is a sign of confrontation and ears back is a sign of hostility. BUT .....   My brother has a pit bull who stares at people too.   It's a trip!  We wonder what's going on in that empty boulder of a head of hers!  She has NEVER been aggressive.  Honestly, it's just like she zones out or something, like she's just staring off into space!!  We usually just wrestle her to the ground and rub and pet her - she loves it!  I've also worked with dogs who ALWAYS look you in the eyes - for some of them, it's simply a reassurance/comfort thing.)<br>  Warning:  German Shepherd generally hate to be look at in the eyes, so if you have a GS and she's a new addition to your family, maybe just call her to you by name.  Do NOT stare back into her eyes as it may provoke a hostile reaction.<br>  Good luck!|`|FRNDkLNqaa	You know, animals in general do that to me alot. Sometimes they are just waiting to see what your going to do. in other words, they are kinda confused.|`|BpKECFBSaa	Haha! Dogs just do that. Its for different reasons. Its kinda creepy though!|`|B9KGdYdJaa	omg i have a rotti named daisy im 12 and whene ever i stand up she al ways stares at me and if i pretend to fun she just takes of so i think your ''problem'' is that she wants to play|`|AA11586880	Maybe she is waiting for a snack or a "play" opportunity. If you get up and get a toy, she will probably get pretty excited.|`|Uz0RyiVvaa	Is she bored? Play with her.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Awww, she luvvvvvs you!   Seriously, she's looking to you for instructions, I think?   Actually it's good that you have her attention -wish my little Whippet was so attentive lol.|`|psLk5fDGaa	My Yorkie does that too. It usually means she wants attention. She'll stare at me until I glance in her direction and then she'll start kicking her feet and whining. Lol, but it does scare me too when I catch her staring me down!
IXgPHYbDaa	Its not normal, no.<br>  <br>  but its also not harmful. <br>  <br>  marijuana has never killed anyone in history, its impossible to overdose on marijuana (proven fact) the dog will just get very mellow. <br>  The dog may actually like it, but he also may not.<br>  <br>  i wouldnt do it to my dog personally.|`|3BMBZtDxaa	What's up with people saying the dog will fine because of a human reaction?<br>  <br>  Dogs are much different than people. So you need to get her to stop it. The dog is probably deaf in that ear by now and has neurological damage. Obviously so since he walks very slowly and bumps into things.<br>  <br>  That is definitely animal cruelty. If you care about the dog and she doesn't stop, call animal rescue and get that dog out of the situation.<br>  <br>  By the way, I have nothing against pot heads, but what's up with you guys wanting to get everyone and everything around you high when you're getting high? It's just something I've noticed and always wondered...|`|dWed21jUaa	She needs to stop. She's going to damage his ear if she hasn't already.<br>  <br>  I almost forgot, how does she know that's going to get the dog high? I've h eard some strange myths come out of the month of a stoner and a lot are not true and some are dangerous. Not saying potheads are bad, but they don't always research things before they do it.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  she's damaged his ear, his equalibrium is off. Have fun explaining that one to the vet. And yes, he does need to see a vet immediatly.|`|0mXQODsIaa	lol. but still cant be good for the dog|`|AA10599589	This is as bad as trying to get a baby high.  Neither the dog nor a baby/child have a say....  would it be cute and funny to see a child stumble around.  This is a form of abuse and I'm sure whoever the breeder of this poor puppy is would be devastate to hear that their dog is being mistreat in this manner.  Report it to the breeder, if no one else.|`|BpKECFBSaa	Um she should definately stop and get that dog to a vet. It sounds like he is having neurological issues and he could die! Please tell her to take the dog to the vet and to stop blowing smoke into his ear!|`|BqXSymxjaa	He's a stoner, that may be why. Stop getting him high for awhile and see what happens. Some dogs just don't bark.|`|4f28b4094a6709e18a06d875e2ffb0c9aa	tell your NOT friend to stay away from you and your dog|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Cigarettes and cigarette butts, cigars, pipe tobacco, nicotine patches, nicotine gum and chewing tobacco can be fatal to dogs if ingested. Signs of nicotine poisoning can appear within an hour and include hyperactivity, salivation, panting, vomiting and diarrhea. Advanced signs include muscle weakness, twitching, collapse, coma, increased heart rate and cardiac arrest. If anyone who lives in or visits your home smokes, tell them to keep tobacco products out of reach of pets and to dispose of butts immediately. If you suspect your dog has ingested any of these seek veterinary treatment immediately.|`|JmMrgtGqaa	that is kind of wierd
psLk5fDGaa	That is a very odd reason not to want to get a dog. I know that I had similar feelings when my dogs passed away. I thought to myself "I could never live through this again, just take all of my dogs so I can get over the grief now." But I didn't truly mean that. <br>  Dogs are a man's best friend. Loyal, attentive, and family oriented. I would have never traded my dogs for anything in the world, including not feeling the great loss I felt after their passing. It is worth it. I think that grief is an extremely powerful feeling. To know that it is humanly possible to love something so much, that it hurts that much when they die? It's overwhelming. Death is a natural part of life. Instead of morning their death, you should rejoice in their life and know that you gave them a happy life. <br>  You could also show them the poem "Rainbow Bridge" about losing pets and where they go when they die. It's a really sweet poem.|`|Wxr3mIRnaa	Well 1st of,<br>  <br>  I think that at least of good accompaniment is worth the sorrow, <br>  <br>  Dogs, are faithful, elegent, smart, and very cute animals, if they are treated with care and love they could live up to 15+ years, <br>  <br>  Well to convince your parents, all you have to do is show them the cute dog you are planning to get, they will instantly fall in love and want it ^^ ,<br>  <br>  Good Luck on getting a new Dog, <br>  I recomend a golden retriever for a family like yours, easy to keep and very faithful and cute .. :D|`|hHAdA9V9aa	Awww I'm sorry they flew away :( But I'm sure they're having great fun! There's no amount of places they can explore and lots of people put feed out for birds.<br>  <br>  I dread the day my three will die (I know I must be a glutton for punishment) but they do bring so much joy in to your life, just like children.<br>  <br>  What I found especially rewarding was that all the hard work I put in to training them paid off! Make sure you get a good book about caring for dogs (telling about nutrition, training, vaccinations etc) and research the best breed for you if you haven't owned a dog before!|`|sxk08R2caa	Yes it is!<br>  <br>  Let's be honest, dogs are hard work but it is so worth it! They are loyal to you, they respect you, they are great fun and most of all they comfort you when your down.<br>  <br>  Death is a natural part of life, so when your dog does die instead of mourning it, why dont you celebrate its life?|`|4ykO2wj9aa	I think its is We have a 14 year old Dachshund That I've had since I was 5. Every moment is a great memory. Shes still alive but We do Dread the Day she will die. Memories are a great thing with a Dog along with their loyalty.|`|iZcOz6E6aa	Death is a natural cycle in life... nothing to shy away from, and certainly an odd reason not to accept a pet into your home/life. I've had to say goodbye to many pets over the years, and while a sad occurance, the joy and love they brought me and my family was worth it.<br>  As for "worth it", its really up to your family and if a dog would work for you. We've only had dogs the last 10 years or so and I personally don't ever see Not having a dog or two.  You can't always convice the family to agree with you, but maybe they'll see your point of view. <br>  Since others already listed the good things, I'll list some possible cons to dog ownership.<br>  Expense: Food, vet bills (even unexpected ones.. those are usually the expensive ones, sadly), toys, classes, boarding (if you ever take vacations/family trips the dog won't be coming along, you need to board or other service to care for the dog). Its amazing, really, how much a dog can cost you just in a year. Not that its a bad thing, just something to consider. I've known too many people to underestimate that fact and the dog is the one who pays for it. :(<br>  Time: Dogs require your attention and time. You can't expect them to lay around all day or only need 10 minutes of your time like a cat. They need walks for potty/exercise, basic training classes, maybe even activities like agility/flyball/loure coursing. They lick, they drool, they get happy to see their people. I don't think I've had a dog yet that wasn't basically a furry shadow or furry growth :) <br>  And generally, this is a being dependent on you for at least 15 years (you can figure more for smaller dogs and less for larger, assuming health is good) in all aspects. Are there any big things that could effect a dog or your family? New family members on the way? Moving? These are two biggest reasons dogs find themselves without a home/family; people don't think ahead or even consider the dog until its too late. <br>  So.. generally, a dog is a great pet and totally worth it. :) Look into different breeds to see if you can figure out what kind of dog would be best suited for you and your family. Good luck. :)|`|ppNm3MORaa	Yesyes =) so i can play wif it.  Golden Retreiver, i suggest?|`|71i6IjdZaa	Of course its worth it love, you can have up to 16 years of love with your dog, and you only have to put up with a year or so of sadness, so its definitely worth it:)<br>  xx

9kTejB0uaa	Are we talking about bringing in a third dog here?  Sometimes this can be difficult.  But the pack order thing is relevant.  And you don't establish it (apart from being the alpha), they do.  The problem is what happens when one of the two you have left, who are 'inseparable'? dies.  Now might be a good time to bring in another, so you never have one left alone - been there, done that, and regretted not replacing my 'third' when she died because I have now lost the second-last, who was the closest buddie with her brother.  When she died, he was totally lost, never lived on his own before etc.etc.<br>  <br>  So I'd say, as long as you make sure the buy in third one is a good match for the other two, go for it.|`|taLD45Sqaa	No they won't be 'sad' and no it won't ruin their bond. They will simply adjust to let the new dog into their pack, most likely at the bottom of the hierarchy. There will probably be scuffles at first but they will figure it out. The real question is do you actually want another dog or are you doing it on emotions? Do you want the added rresponsibilities|`|uHxfAyjBaa	You should not be guilt ridden about dogs in shelters...you did nothing to put them there... and you can't take them all.  We all just do what we can...<br>  <br>  Bringing a new dog into an established house is a big thing and it can disrupt the order of things.<br>  <br>  You need to clearly establish the pack order,  dogs are much happier with a clear definition of pack order.|`|G0wXt0mlaa	Do you create another char, or max the two you already have? It's a choice that alot of have to make.|`|AA10038124	No but it is up to you to keep the peace in you pack.|`|cGNaZU4Gaa	yes|`|8QxXAmn4aa	Yes, and No<br>  <br>  Yes, your current dog will turn sad!<br>  No, don't get another dog!|`|IcXmZc6saa	yes it will mess up the old bond

That is awful.
W02kTOqmaa	The majority of PetCo's have horrible fish. Not all of them, but the majority. I worked for PetSmart for years, and many of my friends are managers through PetSmart, as well as my boyfriend. I can not tell you the number of customers that would come in complaining about their fish. Now granted, not every PetSmart is perfect, but many of my tanks are somewhat stocked from PetSmart, and I would NEVER buy a freshwater fish from PetCo, mainly because their selection has never looked healthy to me. Not only that, but several of my managers through petsmart had started as petco managers and leads, and had switched over to petsmart after being unhappy with the company.<br>  <br>  There is ONE PetCo in my area (out of 8) that does have a very good Aquatics section. All their tanks look clean, their fish look healthy, and I have purchased numerous damsels, clown fish, and anemones from them. So not every petco is bad, just as not every petsmart is good.<br>  <br>  Look at the tanks. Are they always dirty? The one by my house is the only one I've ever seen with clean tanks. How do the fish look? Do alot of them have ick? Or do they all look good. Something most people don't know, ick is ALWAYS present in water. Stress will cause a fish to get ick. Stressed and unhealthy fish will have ick the majority of the time.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	"Under Observation" many mean the fish are sick or that they just came in. Regardless I would recommend avoiding PetCo period for fish.   I stood in my local store one day and watched an employee that was going to sell a customer a fish that clearly had marine ich without saying a word about it. I waited until she walked away to get the net and told the customer the problem so fortunately he did not buy the fish. Find a good local fish store as a source of fish. They generally have much heather fish and are knowledgeable enough to actually help you if you need help instead of just offering poor advise or saying anything to make a sale as many large "box stores" do.|`|eq5qPnRGaa	Probably either sick or exposed.  Big box stores do not usually quarantine fish, and they generally run their tanks on a centralized filter system (all tanks of a specific type are linked to the same filter and the water intermingles).  All this means easier maintenance for the staff, but it is risky.  Things have improved with the advent of UV sterilization set ups for the filters, but if one fish of the hundreds is sick, it can potentially contaminate every fish in any tank on the same filter.<br>  <br>  Personally I try to never buy anywhere except the local aquatics specialty store.  They run each tank on its own filter, practice very strict sanitation, and get most of their fish from a single supplier who has strict pre-shipping quarantine and acclimation procedures.  Any fish they don't get from this supplier they will quarantine before selling, and the minute one fish in any tank looks bad, they will quarantine the tank until the issue is resolved.  Their fish are more expensive, and often older than many big box fish, but I've never had any trouble with any of them.<br>  <br>  If I just can't resist a fish at a big box store (found that perfectly colored angel fish I'd been wanting, at a bargain price, and as a juvenile that won't try to eat all my smaller fish...yet) I buy only if they have a 14 day guarantee, that particular fish exhibits no signs of illness, and then I quarantine them for 14 days is a smaller hospital tank before adding them to any established tank.  Half will sail through and end up moving in.  Half will die or require medication before then, which usually results in me taking them back to the store and asking for a refund.|`|AraBfesHaa	You should have asked them.  I did.<br>  They put these signs on the tanks when they get new shipments in and leave them on for 24 hours.  They won't sell the fish before then.  They are making sure the fish will survive the move and keeping them from being double stressed in such a short period of time.<br>  Personally, I don't think Id buy a fish from there either.  Ive gone there too many times and have seen dozens of fish floating dead in the tanks.  Maybe I should have observed to see if it's the same person working there and doesn't want to be bothered with removing the dead fish.  It's just not good practice to leave the fish dead in there, let alone, bad for sales.|`|qMO9S6kvaa	I do not like buying fish from Petco personally. I have hardly ever had good luck with their fish, the only fish that i have had luck with are guppies and a gourami which i still have. I noticed that petco all most all ways has their gold fish under observation....... :/<br>  <br>  When i go and get fish or feeder fish for my big cichlids, i go to the locally owned store, who goes through local breeders. :D   The fish they ship spend less time being shipped and are less stressed. So most likely more healthy.|`|WK6UNCm5aa	They might be out of stock. Wait a couple weeks or a month and check.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Most fish that come in (this applies to most pet shops) are sick. If they arent all sick, theres a few in there that are, and they have to treat the entire tank. Local shops will just treat it and still sell fish from there until it gets bad. With Petco, they tend to quarantine an entire tank when they notice a sick one. I say still go there if its the closest. Petco, as a whole, takes very good care of their animals. Theyll treat until everything is fine. And they wont sell from those tanks/cages.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Under Observation and not for sale could mean that they had an outbreak of disease in their tanks and are treating them. I personally never liked Petco when it comes to fish, anyways. I had bought a few fish from there one time, and each one died within the 14 day guarantee. I tested my water at home and everything was within normal range. When I brought the fish in, along with the required water for testing (separate bag from dead fish), they tested the water and said that my nitrates were high. It was at 20, which, according to the test they used was within normal limits. They wouldn't give me my money back or even exchange the fish because the water was "bad" in my tank. Anyways...sorry for the extensive story. But yeah, unless it's a brand new Petco and they just got fish in their tanks, it's most likely that the fish had an outbreak of a disease.

ZxGAKWHQaa	Fred Lanting suggests raising the temperature in the whelping box to 100 degrees... this ought to maintain the pups' body temperature in the range of a slight fever, which may be enough to kill the virus. This much heat would scare me, but so would the thought of losing puppies. I would do whatever necessary to maintain hydration if I tried this. Good luck with this. I would definitely do a breeding moratorium until the virus was environmentally reduced, and be very careful that anyone coming into your home did not carry it home to their animals.<br>  <a href="http://www.videxgsd.com/canine_herpes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.videxgsd.com/canine_herpes.ht...</a>|`|5d1922a8010556d2ac29b58c67daef32aa	as last answer and good luck|`|9AtkOXFvaa	talk to your vet

1Qh9i9cWaa	Guppies are very easy to find if you have any kind of fish shop that's not a petco or that garbage. <br>  <br>  6 fancy guppy's will do fine in a 10 gallon yes. Get a couple cory catfish too. Look up them both before you buy them however. See what they eat and what they need to live as far as water PH and Temp. <br>  <br>  Only 2 or maybe 3 males guppy's in that group of 6. If you put more than 2 males in the tank they will kill each other or one will bully the other one to death. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	I would say 5-8 males ONLY. For a proper breeding set up with females (who get larger than the males) you'd need more like a 20-30 gallon to cope with the dramatic increases in number.<br>  <br>  The inch per gallon rule is bull. Guppies get larger than an inch and that "rule" doesn't take into account the Guppy's very active nature, they need space to swim. That rule also doesn't consider other needs like territories, where the fish swim in the water column, shoaling needs, bioload etc etc etc etc.|`|nbtVuFVNaa	1 gallon per inch of the adult average...so 12 max...u want happy fish no more than 10...not crowded even less...and if u get male and female concider kids every month!|`|AraBfesHaa	If you're getting only MALES, about 8 would do it.<br>  If you're getting only females, I'd only get 2, because most female guppies are already pregnant when you buy them and every 4 weeks you'll be having up to 80 new fish per female.  They store sperm with one mating and release fry every month for up to 6 months without mating again.<br>  If you get a male and a female, again, you only need one of each.  She'll most likely already be pregnant when you buy her, and if not, will soon be with a male in the tank with her.  A 12 gallon tank will be overcrowded with just one batch of fry, and it never quits after that.<br>  I started out with 2 livebearers (that's what they are, they don't lay eggs) in a 10 gallon tank and that's all I wanted.  Turns out they were both females, and both pregnant, which I didn't know until the next morning when there were fry swimming all over the tank.  I now have over 240 gallons worth of different sized tanks just to house them all :(  Trust me, I know.<br>  The only way to stop it is to completely separate the males and females into their own tanks, a task I am in the middle of right now.  Once that's finished, I'll have to continue separating them as long as there's pregnant females, so my job won't be done for over 6 months, as I still haven't finished separating them, and in the meantime, they're still getting pregnant.<br>  And don't forget, once the fry become adolescents, they'll be reproducing also.  :(  One of mine, just 2 months old, just had a batch 4 nights ago.<br>  Also even though their small, adding a bunch of fry to your tank will diminish the water quality mostly in the form of ammonia spikes, so you'll have to keep an eye on the water parameters more frequently.|`|wx2UfKOdaa	i would say as others said 12 is fine coz soon ur fish will have many babies...|`|En9ULfGUaa	10 is best|`|qMO9S6kvaa	A gallon of water per inch of fish is a good rule of thumb. Id say ten is a good number. They can grow to be from 1-2 inches long. Remember if you get males and females, these fish reproduce at a very high rate, and the female guppies you may receive from the pet store may all ready be pregnant. Female guppies can lay 3-5 batches of babies from just one visit with a male, because they hold the sperm the receive from the first time they mate. So if you dont want over population in the future, stick with all males.

You are a responsible breeder who has shown their dogs, health tested and know EXACTLY what comes next. Right? Aww...come on don't tell me you have been an irresponsible owner. Here are a few things to take note of...<br>  <br>  1. Dogs are pregnant for approximately 63-65 days.<br>  2. Ask your vet for any much needed help from here on in.<br>  3. Since her birth you will notice her to have saggy skin.<br>  4. Afterward, get her spayed..<br>  <br>  ...You will find out that it is *NOT EASY* caring for 11 or so puppies.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Anyone who doesn't know the gestation period for a dog has no business breeding.<br>  <br>  After these pups are weaned spay your dog and stop producing pound fodder.

This means she has another couple of weeks to go.<br>  <br>  I hope you have more knowledge about rearing these puppies, once they have been born (not to mention the appropriate whelping quarters etc. ready)!
9kTejB0uaa	It's the smell of Frontline.  Mine do the same.  He's trying to rid himself of this strange smell you've put on him.  It's normal.<br>  <br>  ps  It might be kinder to let him outside after you have sprayed him (or even spray him outside), so he's not confined in his crate, with the smell?<br>  <br>  Edit -  I'm not wrong re the smell - my Bassets too go nuts when I do this to them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  But I do agree that Advantage is better.  lol|`|Z9eH58d7aa	He doesn't like that you sprayed him he's trying to get the spray off, not the itching it's ok|`|ihLJUKonaa	you might have put more than you suppost 2. or probably he already had his skin to irritated from scratching. take him to a vet and he will give you some medicine to stop the itching and some for the infection if he has one. and by the way i prefer to use advantage is a little more expensive but i think is the best out there. good luck and hope your dog gets better. p.s. dont listen to mamab. the smell lol.
4FZJUQesaa	Why don't you tell this to your friend... "YOUR SELFISH"  <br>  <br>  You shouldn't get a puppy unless you can stay home with it during the day.

Lots of people have theirt dogs in outside runs or kennels during the day, and bring them inside when they're home with them after work.<br>  <br>  I think you need to give dogs credit for having a bit more intelligence.<br>  <br>  The issue is simply how your friend trains the pup when she is inside with it.  There are heaps of sites/books etc on house training.|`|9kTejB0uaa	What a sad, lonely, confused puppy this must be!

p3vjvzRPaa	It is wonderful that you've been feeding her - good on you.  But a dog does need more than just food and water.<br>  <br>  If you are not financially able to look after all this dog's needs then take her to someone who is.  <br>  <br>  You're not doing her any favours to keep her around your house by feeding her if you're not going to also look after her health needs.<br>  <br>  How about seeing if there's a humane society or shelter around who can help her?|`|psLk5fDGaa	I think the best option is to take her to a no kill animal shelter. I doubt she would've left the puppies for the stillborn. They usually discard it right away and begin taking care of the rest of them. It isn't impossible for dogs to only have 1 pup, but it is uncommon. <br>  If she is well tempered dog then she will be adopted. But for now she needs to be sheltered and fed. Where are you located?|`|MUAD78xRaa	Dogs are driven by instinct. Bear this in mind when I tell you that if she had any still born pups, she probably ate them; this is nature's way. No-one knows why some animals do this, but it's probably a survival instinct. <br>  Be aware that often strays carry disease, so be very careful to always wash after petting her and the pup. Also, if you plan to keep her you will need to get them both vaccinated, and they need to be checked for parasites.<br>  Good luck.

It is normal with young dogs. You can teach them not to do it by yelping whenever they bite to hard. Don't yell or they will fear you and never hit them.

You will be rewarded with a good dog.|`|AA11589437	No, but he must learn not to bite,because if he does that when he is older it will be more painful.<br>  To teach him not to bite, never hit him back or push him or anything, it is not a matter of abuse, but it makes the rough game more exciting for him and he does it more. <br>  You must remain completely still, indefferent to the dog, put your hands inwards where he can't bite you, and generally show him indifference until he gets disappointed. Play with him and praise him when he is not biting.|`|9kTejB0uaa	At 3 months?  And a Labrador?  Nah.  This is puppy stuff.  But you do need to curb it because this is a no-no which can be transferred into adulthood.  He needs to learn this isn't acceptable behaviour with humans.

You should mildly chastise him every time he bites you. An effective way is to sharply rap a folded newspaper on the floor of a table close to him. If you encourage his biting, the dog will become uncontrollable when he grows up.|`|ccccf2dbeb590052b4953d1fbdf1eb20aa	Its a puppy. Its at the biting stage.  There new teeth are coming out so they need things to chew.  I recommend you get him some chew toys.  The KONG Toy is good.  If it keeps biting you, you should probably stop it because when it gets older, it will keep doing, so when he bites you say OUCH real loud.  whine like a dog show him/her that he/she hurted you.  Your dog will later learn that it hurts when he bites you.|`|eVubSKcEaa	i feel you are new to dogs.. the puppy must have playfull bit you.. it must not have growled and attacked you.. this is the age when he starts getting aggressive and scratches and bites.. it learns to defend itself.. if it is your pet then you would know its habits.. does it roam outside too much?? If it does then it would also play in dirty places.. then it can contract infections that could hav passed on to you.. if the puppy has all his vaccinations and injections in place, you need not worry.. puppies usually have sharper teeth than adult dogs.. puppies of this age also have the habit of biting things like shoes, socks, wires, etc. so keep harmful things away from him.. buy him a biting toy for him to bite. it will be alailable in a pet shop..<br>  the bottomline is: it is probably a scratch, not a big bite.. so dont worry.. people get bruises and scratches all the time.. if the wound develops infection or pus, see a doctor..|`|DvjbTNXvaa	Usually, it isn't dangerous.As long as it's vaccinated, there is not much harm but still try to teach him not to bite or scratch, use signals or signs for this.<br>  Consult your doctor if the bite is serious and especially is your dg isn't vaccinated.<br>  I hope this helps!:)|`|teFKJflZaa	its just playing, my dog of 6 years still bites me, (but not hard) as long as it doesn't get nasty as it gets older, its just fine|`|Z9eH58d7aa	yes if it is a mean bite, but if the dog is playing then dont worry. it is still a puppy|`|mnoJCELIaa	he might need you to play with him|`|00f8c2812ba09bc8a391443e94a73f0eaa	1.

It's normal.<br>  <br>  Make sure your turtle can get out of the water to sunbathe and that he has a UVB light that's above the basking spot.  Bring him/her outside in the sunlight for an hour a day or so, it'll be good for his shell.|`|CdRlOsnyaa	Clean infected areas thoroughly with a strong, undiluted betadine, iodine or Nolvasan solution. Let the turtle air dry in a warm setting for about 45 minutes.<br>  <br>  Apply a generous coating of Silvadene cream. Work into problem areas.<br>  <br>  Leave the turtle dry and warm, ensuring that you do not over-heat, for 18-21 hours each day. <br>  <br>  The next day, scrub entire shell with a one of the previously mentioned solutions, using a soft-bristled toothbrush<br>  <br>  Place them into fresh, clean water. Let them swim, drink and eat for approximately 1 -  1 ? hours.<br>  <br>  Repeat procedure from Step 1.<br>  <br>  This treatment performed daily or twice daily, depending on your time  allocation, has been successful in as few as 8-10 days but in more extreme cases can take a few weeks. It is difficult to tell success right away, so it is often discouraging. It is, however, quite effective and you will begin to see small improvement (in most cases) in only a few weeks. <br>  <br>  NOTE: The betadine bath's 'weak tea' solution is not advised as this can potentially bring about health issues later on.<br>  <br>  Treatment using Acriflavine<br>  <br>  Acriflavine is one of the greatest meds to use with turtles. I have treated shell infections with numerous medications and methods, but Acriflavine has given me better and faster results. This is my treatment method:<br>  <br>  Week 1 - Do a complete water change. Remove any carbon media from filters. Add Acriflavine according to the directions on the label.<br>  <br>  Week 2 - Do a 100% water change again, adding another treatment of Acriflavine.<br>  <br>  Week 3 - Yet another 100% water change, this time, do not add in Acriflavine. Do not add any carbon media at this time.<br>  <br>  Week 4 - Do a 100% water change again, adding another treatment of Acriflavine.<br>  <br>  Week 5 - Personal preference on either leaving the treated water in the habitat, or changing it out. I have done both and have seen no differences in affect.<br>  <br>  At this point, do 50% water changes for the next few weeks, and then taper back down to your normal routine. This will not only assist in fighting off anything that is trying to re-establish itself in your turtle's home, but also helps in general with water quality until the turtle has had proper time to heal.<br>  <br>  those are to ways to help clean that off of your turtle|`|JdJkibqbaa	you need to get a liquid for it from the pet.<br>  <br>  hope this helps.

a5ad2ebbc4866407635f0606f168b5acaa	Please do not love on her or tell her it is ok, these crazy answers are the people who get killed down the road. The horse is doing nothing but being disrespectful and telling you she wants you to stop.  Do not let her get away with this.  Keep her on a lead rope (rope halter or don't bother using one) when she starts to do that, give her a job to do, back her up, work her around you.  When she stands still begin to groom her.  Soon she will learn that you are in charge and that if she thorws her fit, she will have to move and work.  She will soon learn that standing still is much more comfortable.  She is testing you, so be the lead horse and don't let her get away with it.|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	She may be ticklish.|`|nV9QYVq6aa	Maybe she's impatiant, or maybe you're tickling her.<br>  <br>  Use a steady and firm hand, nothing light and too gentle because it can tickle them.<br>  <br>  Watch out for the belly area, they can be touchy there.<br>  <br>  Other than that, tell her to knock it off.

It is important for you to learn to read equine body language, since that is the way they communicate. It is just as important for you to learn as it is for the horse to learn your language (meaning commands).<br>  It could be impatience as well., but I am betting on flies. Does she switch her tail and shudder her withers? There ya go.|`|200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	Depends on your define of "stomp"<br>  <br>  If a horse just picks up the hind or front leg and quickly placing it on the ground, making the impact noise of it, then horse can be: irritated with flies, insects or the area you are touching him/her in.  When my horses stomp, those are the reasons as it stops when I place fly spray and don't go hard or touch the area's I was. <br>  <br>  Now, my gelding paws the ground once in awhile. (extends front leg, swips it on the ground and repeats. A form of digging). That is a behavior problem that needs proper ground work to break them of that. That is when they are irritated, annoyed, nervous, upset that you or another horse walks away from them while they are tied, it represents them being anxious for food, mad for being punished by you or another horse.    <br>  <br>  If ears are forward, horse is alert, not moving around alot, then most likely it can be insects on the legs making them uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  If the ears are back, horse is moving around a lot and flar nostrils, then the horse is irritated mostly by you and might be impatient when standing.<br>  <br>  A horse doesn't always obey and can't expect the horse to obey "your" commands, when he/she is already trained for your friend.  You just do the same commands as your friend does with the horse. It is all about respect and being consistant. <br>  <br>  Horse will test you because you are not the normal owner and you are a different level of rider, based on the horse. so, horses have natural scenses to be testy, even to your friend. <br>  <br>  As long as the horse is not representing inappropriate behavior like kicking, moving around too much, or biting etc, then the stomping isn't too big of a deal to mess with.<br>  <br>  Just check to see if any insects, flies, any soreness and tender spots on the horse.<br>  <br>  have a second opinion from someone else to observe the horse to see what they think.

Make their meal times random, and most importantly, DON'T feed them if they whine. That will just teach them that whining "feed us mommymommymommy  FEED US!" gets them what they want.|`|da254e148d14e8e63d10389a2330c7f0aa	Switch up the feeding and walking time. It will be annoying at first but eventyually they will not know when to do it. <br>  Maybe feed them early and take them out later or whatever. Keep them guessing but make sure you still feed them and take them for walks. If that wont work I would suggest seeing a dog trainer to help you

They should go to jail for animal cruelty.|`|35a2c72445b87a1655d477a08e99e40daa	We can't always assume that the way we treat animals in our culture is right. Yes it seems wrong to treat cats and dogs badly by kicking or poisoning them but we do this to some animals in our culture too - what about rats, mice and other rodents that are considered pests?  What about farm animals that we slaughter to eat? We can't always assume that just because we do something in our own culture that makes it right or because something is not done in our culture it is wrong. <br>  <br>  I went to Greece and I didn't see anyone hurting animals. They did seem to have a bad stray cat problem though. If kicking or hurting animals does occur in their culture perhaps these animals have a different status there. Maybe they are considered vermin like mice or rats here. <br>  <br>  In different places different animals are considered important and different animals are considered food or pets. Just because people have different statuses for animals we consider pets doesn't neccesarily mean they are cruel to animals. <br>  <br>  For example: In ancient egypt cats were sacred, in hindu cultures cows are not allowed to be slaughtered, muslims and jewish people don't eat pigs. And in some cultures people eat cats and dogs. To people in these countries some of the ways we treat certain animals probably seem unacceptable. <br>  <br>  You can't expect all the rules to be the same when you go to different countries. Everywhere you go there are cultural standards for the treatment of different animals and you can't always tell people what is right and wrong. Certain things we do might look wrong in different cultures. There will also always be some people who are kind to animals and others who hurt animals. All we can do is try to educate people that animals do feel pain too and try to teach them to respect them. But we can't act like where we live we always treat all animals perfectly or that there are no people here who hurt animals.|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	I don't know if the above is true, but I do know that some humans are brutal (and this is an understatement) to animals.

35a01c488c521beb432dc52893dd0146aa	How easy a dog is to housetrain really depends on the dog and its upbringing before coming into your home, although the breed can have a big effect on it, too.  For example, hounds are horrible for housetraining, but a chow puppy might be just as bad if you got it from a pet store where it's forced to eliminate in its immediate quarters.<br>  <br>  I think the more primitive, rugged breeds respond better to housetraining, not breeds that have been toyed around with too much.  For example, the Siberian husky tends to be a very healthy, natural breed, and because they're a little more primitive than say, a maltese, they have a strong instinct to eliminate far away from their sleeping quarters.  I think Australian cattle dogs also respond well to housetraining.|`|f8be0a59f4ae196fee609c52bd995808aa	Terriers...like JRT's and Wheaton's and Northern breeds like Malamutes and Akitas are known to housetrain in two weeks.|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	This I believe depends upon the individual dog themselves.|`|AA10250843	Most breeds in the Working Group are easy to train - by their genes, they take training & direction well.

0e09e3cb854ad678a8b662a775ccb429aa	There are several good trainers in the southeast to break and start your horse.  However, it would be easier to know what discipline you want your horse trained in.  (Cutting, Reining, Western Pleasure, Barrels, etc.)  I break and train my own horses, but I know several of the pro. trainers in S.GA and I visit them quite frequently to learn new techniques.  I have also watched the Parellis and Monty Roberts both in person and on tv.  And reading several training books and articles will help you in aiding toward the training of your own horse.  Sometimes (if you are knowledgeable enough about horses) it is best to do your own training since the horse is your own and already has your trust.  Trust is the biggest issue in training.  If the horse doesn't trust the trainer, there is more of a chance he will act out.  If you would like more info about the S. Georgia trainers, please let me know!|`|03f9b186a46e29ec326a3b0c0f96515eaa	well if you lived close to alabama i would say ME.. but umm look up under the pat parelli and john lyons they have tons of trainers out there.. and every were they are good methods.. and all.|`|21a51f5e877022b7cd65293d85e4fc54aa	Where are you located.

c3d220cabbc32f1d84c682c54f03b361aa	Microtech works great!! The hair will literally start growing back over night. Its expensive but you will probably only need one bottle.|`|AA11265363	your horse is probably full of junk that attracts the flies to him. <br>  if you use alfalfa, slowly ease him off of that into orchard grass or timothy. alfalfa has too much sugar and protein for horses, which causes their body to try and get rid of it through their skin, which attracts flies. also, buy a less intense wormer. do you use strongid of equimax? don't. those are poisons, nothing more, nothing less. they damage your horse so badly. they're like using dynamite to remove a stone. there's not need. if you have to use a traditional wormer, try panacur. it's more gentle. <br>  also, what might help, is if you get some cheap tea tree oil from walmart or target. pour about two or three bottles of it into a sprizter, and lightly mist your horse all over. then get a sponge and dalute some with water and dab it on his face. it's SUPER strong stuff that stings the eyes, so make sure it's very deluted. see if that helps. give him a nice, cool bath once a week and get an anti-bug shampoo. just keep him as clean, and as healthy as possible. flies are only attracted to unhealthy animals.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|ec9e29bee8843f73d619bfcfd2d0610eaa	Are you positive the itching is from flies and insects?

ba3e6d053b7b5b5d5dce9d4ecfaa6831aa	all dogs can go blind... more to the point though... Though, there are over 20 different eye diseases that are known to occur in Boston Terriers so. The one we fear the most are Juvenile Cataracts which will cause total blindness in a very young dogs. With Boston Terriers it is recommended that CERF exams be given every year. Our personal recommendation, if you don't want to do it every year, is to do it before every breeding or in any year you breed your Boston Terrier. This should ensure that you don't pass a serious eye disease on to the puppies. Also make sure that all puppies are CERFed before they go to their new homes. <br>  <br>  My baby Boston was diagnosed with cataracts at the age of 1 1/2.   With surgery, the problem was corrected.  But, as I mentioned above, unfortunately Bostons have a slew of eye problems... only your vet will be able to tell you for sure what is going on though and how to best treat it. Good luck.|`|bfbf20bfc22dceb302c423bfb553ac2faa	I have had several Bostons.  None have gone blind.  You don't need to worry.  And ask your Vet, he's an expert!!|`|AA11709234	Yes.

9f2bed235446669edc5311b4e4efe332aa	Well, when my dog got loose, i found that the best things to do were A)Hand up flyers with a photo, name, address, and phone number, B)Call all of your local dog wardens, animal shelters, and police stations and warn them to be on the lookout for your dog. Make sure you give a full description, C)keep a constant surveillance on the area where you last saw her. A lot of times, a dog will come back to the places she knows, when she gets hungry, or bored. I really hope this helps, and i hope that you get her back safe and sound!|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	Put up signs.

We got them both back on tips from the posters, we called and put up signs at local vets, called the dog pound (he helped us a lot), and local humane society.

Kataleena Lady was born on March 11th, 1977. So she will be 31 in March.<br>  <br>  World's oldest dog. His name is Butch. He's a beagle. His title is etched in official Guinness World Records certification and he earned it by living for 27 years.|`|AA10419438	Currently, the oldest cat is 27 years old. According to my source, there may soon be a new holder of the title. I think that the oldest dog in the world is 'Bramble' at the age of 27(189 dog years) also. I have enclosed my sources so that you can see for yourself.|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	Last I heard, a hairless cat was still alive at 34 years old.

48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	You have to advertise your dog as a stud first.  Generally, but not always, the female is brought to your dog.  Sometimes you keep her for a couple of days.  Sometimes you meet the other owner at a midway point.  Always as for payment up front.|`|60898ac06a86d5ffcde71b6a3f89a528aa	Not to disappoint you, but anyone that is a responsible breeder  with a stud that is of value would know these things.  You don't just wake up one morning and decide to breed your dog.  Didn't the person you bought your dog from DEMAND that it be neutered?  If not, you likely bought it from a puppy mill which makes it virtually worthless as a stud.  If they did sell it to you as a potential breeder, you would have had some direction in this area.<br>  <br>  Is your dog AKC registered?<br>  How many points has your dog acquired in the show ring?<br>  Champion yet?<br>  These are questions you will need to answer before anyone will be interested in your dog as a potential sire.<br>  <br>  "When does one ask for payment?"<br>  Your intentions are obviously financially centered, as there is usually little to no money exchanged, only "pick" of the litter.<br>  <br>  You aren't a breeder, stay out of the business until you have learned what you are doing from another responsible breeder.<br>  Again, you may have good intentions, but the fact you are asking questions like these means either you are involved in the puppy mill business, OR, you may unintentionally be supporting it.<br>  <br>  Please be responsible and get your Cav neutered.  If you must, have a responsible breeder act as a mentor to you and learn what is involved before you try to breed animals.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Whether or not your dog is "healthy" as suggested by "S" is not the primary reason to decide if you should breed an animal or if it even has any value as a stud.  Any good, reputable breeder will agree that unless your dog (stud in this case) is an IMPROVEMENT to the breed, or at least a prized specimen, there is no real reason/value to passing on it's genetic charachteristics.  (Other than financial)<br>  <br>  I am only assuming (and I will bet correctly) that you are not possessing a MVD free (if you don't know what mitral heart valve disease is, another reason you won't get anywhere with a reputable Cav breeder), AKC registered, Champion Cavalier, or, like I said earlier, you would know!!  <br>  <br>  Again, to reiterate, I don't mean to sound crass, however the Cavalier is a breed that is being heavily overbred by amateurs with poor specimens because of the price tag associated with them.  As such, if your dog does not meet the requirements mentioned earlier, no respectable breeder will be interested.  Anyone that is interested in your dog is suspect.<br>  <br>  If you do have a dog that is of breeding stock, good luck, find a breeder in your area that you can learn from hands-on, and please look out for the interest of the breed.<br>  <br>  P.S.  I own a Cavalier, son of CH "??? Highfalutin" and CH "???? Kissimmee ????".  Upon purchasing this son of two healthy, MVD free, champions, I was required to have him neutered due to a small imperfection above one of his eyes.  (As noted earlier, "if the dog is not an improvement to the breed....")<br>  These breeders take great pride in their stock and would never sell a dog for breeding or they would have kept the specimen themselves.  Anyway.....if you don't "get it" please go talk with someone in person rather than listen to opinions of people that don't know any better.  (????'s are to protect identity of breeders of Champion breeding stock Cavaliers.)|`|AA10088970	You would start first by getting your dog checked for stds and the female in interest also. Its true there are doggy stds that can make his little men stop swimming. He can become infertile. Ask for the proof of a disease free dog before you breed. Then advertise as a stud dog. Some vets will let you advertise at there shop. Ask for pick of the litter or stud fee.|`|XnIxpLeNaa	The guy above doesn't know anything about your dog and needs to cool it. As long as your dog is registered and healthy there is no reason why you shouldn't stud him to other responsible breeders. Either the b*tch can stay with you for a couple of days or you can send your little man to her for a few days. People i know pay when there is proof the b*tch is up the duff (after a vet scan) or you can have pick of the litter.<br>  Everybody has to start somewhere and asking questions is the only way to get to know properly, look into it all properly first though so you know all the ins and outs (excuse the pun!)<br>  As long as you breed responsibly and don't just use your dog to inpregnate every lady dog who pays then why not. Also make sure the owners of the b*tch have homes for all their new arrivals otherwise your doggies babies will be in shelters or living with their mum forever!<br>  Good luck!|`|df7bf836aea5d7c83e8e3ffb0bf38d9baa	Generally you advertise by being a top show dog and having your dog's winning photos in breed magazines. No ethical breeder is going to breed to your dog without a proven show record. So unless you're on your way to a championship, you should neuter him now.

Besides there are many creatures that cannibalize, it's just a matter of survival.|`|e369168ca3379051a569bd512d49bb1caa	Unless the fried "chicken" you were eating  was actually one of those birds (I'm guessing gulls) it's not cannibalism, if a chicken were eating chicken it would be considered cannibalism. Just because one bird eats another does not make it a cannibal, that would be like saying humans are cannibals because they eat beef (mammal eating a mammal). To be considered a cannibal a species must consume an individual of its own species.|`|AA11896821	Many birds especially seagull are omnivorous like us and will eat anything.The concept of cannibalism as being immoral is a purely human concept. I doubt birds have that kind of higher thinking. Avoid giving them fatty foods like fried chicken or chips. If we stop feeding them, they will go back to eating their own healthy diet. Have fun at the beach.

556f6a84a1e72fa5f9fa440c37251fe4aa	I don't know of any websites right off the top of my head, but I do know that mantids are not finicky eaters.  They are ambush predators that will attack mostly anything and eat anything smaller than themselves.<br>  <br>  So if you go to a pet store and get some live crickets or mealworms (think food for lizards or amphibians like frogs & salamanders), you should be able to keep your mantid happy.  Just keep in mind you want to keep the lid on your terrarium closed so neither the food nor the mantid escapes.  Also, live prey is better since mantids hunt visually mainly--they have to see it move before they respond to it.<br>  <br>  Also, one *important* thing, and another reason to keep the mantid in the terrarium.  If you or your neighbors have a cockroach problem, you need to protect your pet from pest control measures.  The closest genetic relative to the praying mantis is the cockroach, so anything that will kill roaches will also kill a mantis.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps....and that you aren't squeamish, like I said, mantids are mainly ambush predators, and rather violent little bugs.  ^_^  Enjoy!|`|09254aa919488f514a70d82720b12279aa	I never heard of people having a praying mantis as a pet but after they mate they will eat the head off of the male.

eb7b3f653ea0e97bafa2dd3ddf8e6ac8aa	The recommended thing to do when this happens is to take the fish out of the tank, wrap a towel around the fish to minimize flopping about, and remove the piece of gravel from the fish's mouth with dull ended tweezers or forceps.  Be very careful not to push the stone further down the fish's throat.  If you feel you are not going to have success going through the mouth, insert a Q-tip through the gill and push the stone out through the mouth.  He's not a dumb fish.  This is his nature.  Goldfish LOVE to play with gravel and will rearrange all day long. I have had friends who have come home from work to find that every single stone in the tank had been collected into one giant pile, leaving the rest of the bottom of tank completely clear of all gravel!  So, you should be very careful about the size of your substrate.  Gravel has its good points and bad.  It should either be very small, very large or none at all.  The problem with very large or none at all, is that you are removing your primary source of beneficial bacteria, and in this case, your only option for a filter would be to use an external wet/dry system, or combination system of a power filter, bio-wheel wet/dry such as the Marineland Magnum 350 Pro.  The deal if you choose to use smaller gravel is it must be so small that it could pass through their system if swallowed without getting stuck, but you can't use sand because, when they play in it, it blows up and sand floating in the water can get stuck in the fish's gills and cut up their gills.  Standard size is 1.5-2 mm.  You should look for gravel around 1mm, but make sure that it doesn't raise the ph.|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	To be sure that won't happen again, you might remove the gravel and put in aquarium sand in it's place.|`|57f3a1a8083d0c4c73054939c9c9c7a5aa	Pick it up off the driveway and put it back in the tank.|`|PBBdapCWaa	Nothing you could really do in that circumstance, but then again given time he will get it unstuck.

No matter how well-trained or well-behaved your dogs are, things can spiral out of control when dogs are allowed on their own.  I especially wouldn't recommend a dog park for small dogs.  I have two 20-pound dogs who have grown up together that ocassionally get into snarly fights I have to break up.<br>  If you want to socialize your dogs, which is really important, I'd suggest a couple things.  One, find a "doggie day camp" (Petsmart offers these in some areas).  Small groups of dogs are allowed to play in an enclosed area.  There are experienced staffers there to look out for aggression and stop fights.  Otherwise, find a neighbor or friend with smaller dogs to have supervised walks or "playdates" with.|`|787413bed752c99c71a22a7fb24ea115aa	There is the good, the bad and the ugly at the dog parks.  I personally don't like them very much, but I have gone a few times wtih my dogs, but I go VERY early in the morning where basically I am the only one there and let my dogs run and swim (we have a beach).<br>  <br>  If you do go - go with a doggie friend and go during off peak hours.  Watch the dogs before you go in and make sure you think the dogs are behaving o.k.  And make sure the owners have control over their dogs.  I've seen owners just hanging out chatting and not watching their dogs.  Some parks are worse than others.|`|dae37e4d94b4b1a9272c227f5f81533aaa	My dog is utd on her shots and on heartworm and flea medication and she loves going to the dog park.  We go to the one at White Rock Lake in Dallas that has 2 areas, one for large and one for small dogs.  Luna is borderline at 30 pounds she could go to either one, but I take her to the big dog one and she loves it.  I've never had a problem except right before I decided to have Luna spayed and another dog kept humping her.  This reminded me to take her in for the surgery.  It's fun for ownders and pets at the dog park because you can talk with the other owners and you're dog gets socialized.  We only have Luna so socialization is important.  The one  at White Rock is also on a lake with plenty of trails to jog with Luna on and the dog park has a seperate area for dogs who get a dip in the lake.  It's always a great experience for us and we've never seen an actual fight.  There's been a few times with dogs have been playing rough or growling and barking at one another, but I've never seen blood drawn or anything like that.  It seems like typical dog behavoir.|`|ec50ef299d015822b0c82ecdafac6ee5aa	When it comes to "off-leash dog parks", we have to differentiate the types of off leash parks first. <br>  There are "off-leash parks" that are a part of big wildness parks. In this type of parks, there are walking trails, hiking trails, and beaches.  There are not fences around the parks and it is normally designated big sections of regional and state parks.<br>  <br>  And there are "dog parks" that are fenced around and there are nothing else in it but an empty limited space where dogs can run around and to play with each other.  These are most common in the cities and suburban neighborhoods.<br>  <br>  I take my dogs to both types of the parks.  What I noticed is that dogs are much more friendly with each other and more preoccupied with other things in any "off-leashed" regional or state park areas.  They may play with other dogs but mainly they are busy smelling the trails, running, walking, looking around and investigating.  In this setting, dogs do not fight with each other. When they meet other dogs in the trail or at the beach, they may greet each other but they usually just move on with whatever they were busy doing.<br>  <br>  However, in a "fenced dog park", the dogs can behave more aggressively.  The reason is that most often, same dogs go to their neighborhood dog parks and they "so of" form a pack of their own whenever they meet at the same dog park.<br>  Naturally, they try to establish their own hierarchy system.<br>  So, if your dog is naturally alpha, it will try to dominate other dogs every time it visits the same dog park.<br>  Therefore, this can be a problem.  In the process of establishing their hierarchy system, they fight for their place.<br>  This is a natually thing for the dogs.|`|f886c3fd6969cf23951f9cf7cb994992aa	I agree with the trainer,off-leash parks are dangerous to not only the dogs but to the people! And more dogs can get loose and get in trouble running around the citys.|`|3f5c685de26b32b13965d5cb704bffceaa	I agree with you. You never know if other animals are spayed; etc. or well adjusted to being around a number of other animals at once. And dogs tend to have a pack heirarchy~ one always wants to be boss. At least that has been my experience.  Some dogs are like people! they don't mix. I have a Siberian Husky and she is very friendly but there are some animals that she does not react well to. You just never know. <br>  I really would like to adopt a grey hound. Awesome that you have one! Good luck!|`|e4891efcb808213d898f07ad2c4ee8e2aa	I have not had an experience with an off leash dog park. But i would never take my dog to one. Your little dog could be mauled by a bigger one, even if they are separated, a big dog might get yours. And without a leash, their owner has no way to control them. And you are absolutely correct that you dont know whether the other dogs have been vaccinated and licensed. I would pass on it.

Hey, it's GREAT that you love your dog, but People, PLEASE! Do Yourself and your groomer a favor! SOCIALIZE your dog! Just because it's the sweetest thing to you and your family, if you have a "Coated Breed" that needs regular Professional grooming, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE! WORK with your dog to accept foot handling, and brushing! More people get bitten in the US by Spaniel breeds than Dobermans, Rotts, Pitbulls, and German Shepherds PUT TOGETHER every year...because there's MORE of them! Yea, they're little, and cute, but they turn into little "CUJO" impersonaters right after you drop them off! Yes, even yours! Same thing at the vet's office. Go ahead, and call up any groomer in the phone book, and just ask them what the top 5 breeds that try to bite are. (Chihuahuas, Dachshunds, and Lhasa's are in there, don't know what it is about little dogs and nail-clipper phobias!) Ok, sorry for ranting!
AA10245177	Cowboy boots are like all shoes, different brands fit differently. The letter after the size refers to the width of the boot. B being narrow (womens sizes) and EEE for the wider foot.

011025cc23dbdb0248758e7c4ae607f1aa	El Bactrim es uno de los antibióticos que se recetan a los perros. La dósis debe ser indicada por el médico veterinario, lo mismo que la cantidad de tomas diarias.<br>  El Bactrim puede dar algo de diarrea, pero también la puede dar la leche, si ya tienen más de 23 días, la alimentación correcta sería papilla con una base de leche especial para perros, junto con alimento remojado y mixado a la leche, o con nestum 5 cereales, ya al mes deben comer semisólido e ir pasando paulatinamente a una comida más seca.<br>  No incluyas otros lácteos en la dieta del cachorro sin indicación médica previa porque le podés provocar más diarrea.|`|2b65a2b87ad07b9f64408b6d2b56fb9caa	La absorcion de los perros es muy diferente a la de las personas respecto a la mayoria de los medicamentos.

d22bc5f37206e4e092d98615fd7965cbaa	Hay que tener en cuenta que los pajaros constantemente se estan acomodando las plumas.Tambien son muy sensibles a toxinas y al tener contacto con substancias toxicos les puede hacer da?o o hasta matarlos.

As for the age of the cat it depends on the collar if you read the package it comes in it will tell you the age that is appropriate(most are between 10 and 12 weeks of age).  There are many different brands of collars and different types too,  I have found that no brand works any better,  but there are stretch activated collars in many brands and they have always worked best for me.<br>  <br>  If your kitten is still to young you can give it a bath with dawn dish liquid,  it does not kill the fleas but it stuns them long enough to get them to fall off and you can wash them down the drain. They wont all fall off but it helps to keep them from getting really thick on your kitten.|`|AA11141391	from a vet tech's point of view ,your are wasting your money on flea collars.they dont work.  go to the vet or southern states and buy frontline plus. the age to apply is 6-8 weeks.|`|c30250ff1daaa05b6f04585c65e5d9a2aa	flea collars dont work<br>  ask your vet for anti flea medicine
4e2ad073dd09592f13bc3d58503bdc2eaa	This can go one of two ways:<br>  A couple of years ago, i worked for a ranch who had a big mare who had the very same problem you are dealing with, she was 18, and you could put a saddle on her, and go to the arena and she would lope for three hours without tiring.  I have not found a solution to this kind of horse.<br>  However, you may want to try one of two things:<br>  First, as soon as you mount up, make her stand still.  If she wants to move, back her up three or four steps, then let her stand.  Keep working on this until she will stand for you.<br>  Secondly, once you have her moving, and she wants to go faster, bring in some lateral flexion.....bring her head round to your foot/knee, let her keep turning in circles until she relaxes and stands still.  If she isn't used to lateral flexion, practice on the ground first, and don't yank her head round, give enough pressure that she moves, but make it her choice.<br>  The last thing I would suggest is to take her into a round pen, and start her on a line (this is not lunging), lead her out with your arm (hold the rope and point where you want her to go) and get her up to a lope with the assistance of a whip (use as a suggestion to her, hit the ground behind her).  Once she's making circles, as soon as she shows any interest in you (eye looks at you, ear turns to you, she turns to come in), bring her in.....make it your decision!  Praise her for standing, being with you.  Send her out again, and start giving her a sign just before you bring her in (i usually bend over and look at their butt (like you are moving their butt away with your eyes)).  She will come to realize that being with you means not working.  You may have to do this on the trail a couple of times if she acts up there.<br>  Good luck, and if you have any more questions, please feel free to email me.<br>  If none of the above work, I would suggest contacting a professional training to help you.|`|43af4771c0ea8441923b2c1f4066f8ffaa	Thats sounds like such a pain. Youre doing the right thing by constantly checking her, but remember when you put constant tension on the reins, all a horse wants to do is pull back so they can have their mouth back. When you give her her head, be sure to make a note of where your legs are, if you use even the slightest pressure, she may be using that as a cue to go faster. But yes keep checking her mouth with your hands low, until she collects her head and then lowers it. By this time you should notice some slack in the reins. Good Luck!|`|60afbcb97f22066c4a6dca5fa76280a8aa	Consult a trainer!<br>  <br>  ask around and get the number of a few trainers, call them, and see what they have to say and what method they would use to correct the problem.<br>  <br>  Sometimes its a matter of riding 5-6 days a week. We have a AQHA that was a barrel horse, cow stuff, etc and trained her all english - she still bolts at the canter though after  1 1/2 years but she's gotten much better - all just from riding, riding, and more riding.<br>  <br>  if she gets ansy just tacking up, I'd tack her up 2-3 days a week and not ride. Just tack up and let her hang out at the tie rail for an hour or so then untack and turn her out.  Let her know not everything is anticipated.|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	your not fighting a losing battle. but ask a trainer to take a look. you may be using the wrong bit.|`|c21d0003bc4cc7e4b99196c5d509dbd7aa	I actually know a Tennesee Walker who does the same thing going towards the barn - run. Before you try to figure out whats going on with the horse, start with yourself.  Are you tensing up when you get on, anticipating that she's going to run? If your heart is racing or your muscles are SLIGHTLY tight, your horse will feel it. Try stretching before getting on, then take very deep breaths all the time when you are on.<br>  <br>  Do not lean forward. This causes the horse to become unbalanced and use her front feet to carry the burden, and this encourages her to speed up.  Do not look down at her, look straight ahead. Looking down shifts your body weight forward. Don't yank or jerk on the reins, horses naturally pull away from pressure. <br>  <br>  Try all this and if the problem persists, consult a trainer to help you. But this should at least make a difference|`|c3d220cabbc32f1d84c682c54f03b361aa	TW horses tend to pick up speed when you keep tension on the reins. Let her have her head and let her figure out that your not pushing her to go faster. Most TW come from a show ring so they go go go all the time and then the rider jumps off.  Thwy never learn just to relax and walk. Their walk will always be a little faster than your average qh though.|`|0cc7a66dfde021f31140c1f5eaeb9aa3aa	Kind of sad horse wants to run you don't sounds like she is not suited to you sell her or get someone that enjoys the ride but please don't slow her down|`|32f52a6384e6b1c487d15def609700f8aa	you know I've rode a horse like that before and I guess the only thing you can do is keeping working on the mellow side more but do you know a lot about the background of the horse when you got her? because the horse I rode had a really hard owner that expected the best from her and was kind of too mean if you ask me so that could be a the reason as to why she does it. People used to call the horse beater. pretty brutal.|`|6b8027b3b3f7c39d43ab75a7af820f1daa	I would say that you might want to lunge her before you ride to help her get rid of some excess energy, but if you don't want to you may want to either ride her more often, or when you ride sit back in the saddle more and when she tries to run sit back and hold her from cantering. Remember when she listens reward her and stop pulling on her mouth!<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps!|`|AA12215295	Pulling back on the reins all the time will just make the problem worse. She will pull back against the pressure and pull you around even more.  When she tries to run off, pull her onto a cirle, a small one if you can and keep her on the circle until she finds her balance and slows up, then let her go large again. The minute she speeds up, take her back onto the circle. I could go on all day on how to solve it using Parelli, but you'd get bored! If you want to know more, go to parelli.com. It will sort out your problem for you!|`|b85e102eba8a0408e3830f1854a51afcaa	Sounds like she was indeed a gaming horse, or simply loves to run. You could try working some of the speed out of her before you ride. If you have a round pen to work her in, this would help. If not, buy a lunge line and work her in circles at a walk, trot and lope. Go slow and with gentle voice commands.  As far as getting her to slow while you are riding, does she try to grab the bit and run away? If this ever happens, reach down the rein, either hand, and pull her in a tight circle, until she comes to a stop. Make her stand still for a bit, then ask her to walk off. There is so much more to tell you, but time is limited tonight for me. You can email me and I'll try to help more if you like.

0e70016f936e3a85064e33cb8fe1917caa	I've heard that if you 1st teach a dog to chase a frisbee and bring it back then he can be taught to catch it. <br>  I'd use a soft, flimsy frisbee to start. I've heard that if you begin by rolling it on the ground (like rolling a ball or coins) then this will teach him to go after it. If he knows the basic sit stay commands then you can begin by just softly flipping it too him from 2 or 3 feet and gradually further. After he learns this, then you can start by throwing it (frisbee style) and having him fetch. If you can throw it soft so that it hovers for a while then they will be more able to catch it. Remember not to throw it really far the first times. Then later increase the distance and tricks.<br>  Good luck and sorry if i'm not much help.

Why are on earth do you want to give your rabbit a blanket??  Is this an indoor or outdoor housed rabbit?? <br>  <br>  Rabbits do not require a blanket for warmth or snuggle purposes.  If you want to offer them something to sit on or snuggle into, then they can have a blanket if you must. But remember, if your rabbit wants to chew on this blanket and consumes too much, it will bind up his digestive system and cause health problems that can lead to death.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of items that a rabbit can sit on or "snuggle" into that are more rabbit safe.  Check with the local pet stores for floor mats made out of natural materials safe for rabbits if consumed.  Or try a litter pan with recycled newspaper.  Nest boxes for breeding does can also double as a "house" for a single bunny.  Pet hay or straw inside this.<br>  <br>  If you are offering blankets for an outdoor housed rabbit, you may want to consider using hay or straw for bedding rather than blankets.  A blanket won't have enough insulation warmth for a rabbit and once he soils the blanket, it will no longer be healthy nor usable.|`|9b1025e7b1156b4ad00da8fd2d8dcdf5aa	i think 3 because its fur is too thin

Kitty sounds like it is feeling insecure and frightened.  I would use one of your rooms, fill it with all of kitty's necessities and then then let kitty have some alone time for a while.  Allow the kitty out to play with you for periods of quiet time and then put her back in the room.  Lengthen the amount of time kitty stays out until she is used to the house environment.  When she tries to attack, have a squirt bottle ready with water and squirt her when she charges.  Add a firm "No" in there and soon all you will have to do is show her the bottle and she will back off.  Good luck.

620b0cf5dcd41ea23225efcf9c3f6f7caa	Using an Egg Incubator <br>  If you're thinking about hatching some of those extra eggs and don't have a broody hen you can always try an egg incubator.<br>  <br>  If money is tight, find a used incubator (see some below) or grab one of the cheaper models. (Beware with the cheaper models however - they often hold only a dozen eggs which will require manual daily turning. I have been told that the success rate with these smaller manual units are only about 50%. Likely due to heat loss when the lid is opened for egg-turning.)<br>  <br>  Pre-Storing Eggs for Your Incubator Schedule<br>  If you just have a few hens and need to store eggs until you've accumulated enough for the incubator, eggs can be stored in a cool place for up to 3 months. Don't wash them before you 'store' them. I've been told that the refrigerator is a fine place, the other keeps them in the basement. I've kept mine in the basement in some damp straw (not sloppy or wet, just not dried out and old) in a bucket for 10 days in waiting with success. <br>  <br>  Not sure if this is a wives' tale, but another reader has written in to say that round eggs are roosters and oval ones hens. If you're hoping for more hens than roosters, try selecting only oval shaped eggs.<br>  <br>  Incubation Period - Timeline<br>  <br>  Place the eggs into the incubator and in 21-22 days at 98 degrees your eggs should start hatching. There are many types of incubators on the market. Check the unit's operating manual for specific instructions on turning, heat settings and moisture control. Truly the incubator with an automated turner and temperature regulator make this job easy.<br>  <br>  Checking Un-hatched Eggs while Still in Incubation<br>  You can 'candle' eggs to see if the chick has progressed in its growth inside the egg at about 15 days. A cheap make-do contraption for candling eggs can be made using an old shoebox and a bare light bulb (I use a mechanics light because it has a wire cage around it ensuring that the light bulb doesn't burn the sides of the box.)<br>  <br>  Insert the light through the side of the box, cut a 2" hole in the top of the box and tape the sides so no light leaks out. Turn off the lights in the room, turn on the candling box and place an egg on top of the hole on top of the box. You should see an outline of the chick and some fluttering movement as the light shines through the egg, or some other movement within at this stage. The light change in the egg itself will cause a living chick to move around. If you see life, quickly place the egg back into the incubator.<br>  <br>  I only resort to this tactic if I am 99% certain the egg is a dud...<br>  <br>  If the day has passed for hatching and you're losing faith in your egg incubator you can also 'check' an egg by gently cracking the shell (leaving the membrane intact). The membrane is the last phase of life for the chick before cracking the shell. The air pocket between membrane and shell is where the chick takes its first breath of life giving it strength to crack through the shell. This practice is highly controversial and has serious potential for damaging the chick inside. <br>  <br>  The First Three Weeks of Life<br>  <br>  Once your chicks are born you must keep them under a heat lamp for the first 3 weeks or so (don't skimp on cash here, the chicks cannot afford a chill). Check in on them often in the first week. If they are piling on top of each other to keep warm or directly under the lamp you'll need to lower the lamp or purchase a hood to spread the heat. If they are standing at their boxes edge to escape the heat, raise the lamp so they don't overheat.<br>  <br>  Feed your chicks a chick starter from the feed store and ensure they always have clean water. You may need to 'show' them the water by gently dipping their beaks into the water dish. When the weather permits and the chicks are old enough you can move the out from under the light and into the hen house.<br>    <br>  <br>  Finally, a word of caution on chicks hatched from an incubator....<br>  While these chicks are young you might like to keep them separate from your existing flock. Some hens are known to dislike new stock coming in and in an effort to maintain pecking order could actually harm the baby chicks. Take extreme measures and integrate new stock into existing flocks with caution.|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	About 95 to 96 degrees fahrenheit.  You need to turn the eggs about twice a day.|`|3fb88f589e5f520edd0755541c44870faa	you should hatch then at 99-101 degrees. I hope your eggs hatch.

AA11918804	I do not know what you have done to make him lose trust in you, thus it makes my answer very difficult.<br>     African Greys are a difficult pet for those without a lot of time to devote. They are very social creatures. They can be quite trying, and very annoying when they do not get what they want. This I am sure that you already know.<br>     I do not know how old he is or how long you have had him, either. These things also make this a very difficult question to answer. So, I will try my best here. Forgive me if I am off-base.<br>     First of all, these birds live upwards of around 80 years. As they get older, they deal less ideally to a change. Secondly, these birds require much interaction from their care-givers. When they are not given what they believe to be an ample amount of attention, they act out. Third of all, they do have to trust their care giver. If that trust has been seriously undermined by a fear for their own safety, it will be a huge mountain to overcome.<br>     Now, given all of this, most of which I am sure that you already know, you must decide what is truly best for your pet. Combine these questions with what I have already said: (1) Do you really really want him in your life?, (2) Are you really really sorry, (3) Do you honestly think that you are not capable of handling him in a proper way regardless of what ever will be or is going on in your life. Remember, it is not his fault, and he has the ability to love you unconditionally. Are you not capable, honestly honestly, of this? (4) Would he be happier with someone else that may have more time and patience to offer him?<br>     Sometimes the most difficult thing to do when we truly love, is to do what is best for the one that we love, even though it will hurt us deeply. If you truly and sincerely care for and love this creature, then you already know the answer to your own question. <br>     My best wishes to both of you. Good luck, and may you make a good and wise choice, whatever it may be. I hope that things get better for you soon, sincerely.|`|b0cc4dc9fb76a8ba638773bdc9a7518caa	I'LL TAKE HIM!!!

AA11866604	Hi Hayley, Vets make anywhere from 40,000 to 125,000 a year. This varies if you are a specialist or a normal vet, you will also probably need to pick to specialize in pets or livestock. It also varies, a vet who's just starting will make about 40,000, and the few who do make 125,000 are those who are very experience and specialize or those who are exceptionally talented. Being a vet is great if you love science and working with animals, but the hard part is euthanaisa and long hours. You will have call and emergencies similiar to doctors and work 45 - 80 hours a week. Here is a site that gives some info on becoming a vet: <a href="http://www.avma.org/careforanimals/animatedjourneys/aboutvets/becomingvet.aspThis" rel="nofollow">http://www.avma.org/careforanimals/anima...</a> site talks about vet techs, this is another option: <a href="http://www.veterinarytechnicianschools.com/Default.aspx?ID=128" rel="nofollow">http://www.veterinarytechnicianschools.c...</a><br>  The other thing I'll tell you is becoming a vet is very difficult, you have to have a very strong 4.0 grade average and even then it can be difficult to get into vet school. If you are in high school now you should be getting into honors classes, but some other classes that would be helpfult to take are Animal Science, Chemistry, Public Speaking, and Statistics and Probability.<br>  You go to school forever too, so if that sounds miserable considering the vet tech option would be great. However, I don't want to put a damper on you, if you sound right and the job sound right, go for it!|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	Most vets like their position.  If you want to be a vet bad enough, the amount that is made is totally irrelevant or I should say, should be irrelevant.  If you are concerned about how much you will make as a vet, I would recommend looking into a different kind of work involving animals.  Someone that wants to be a vet should be going into the position because of their devotion to animals and their care, not the money.|`|28c9b72d5e6caeb12d6f5e323829cb7eaa	If you love animals, you will most likely not want to be a vet. A lot of veterinarians test on live animals in school as well as dead. One very sad story was about a dog who had his leg broken to be set (meaning, THEY BROKE HIS LEG TO PRACTICE FIXING IT), none of the people were experienced enough to do it right and the dog suffered for over a week and died. If you are an animal lover you will NOT go far in this field! Voicing your concern will only make you more targeted and tormented by the others in your class.|`|d8c62ee5e82b7a1e9e6bf805074da9bcaa	my friend is a vet and she gets 56 dollars an hour she loves it but its a little disgusts her because of all the blood
ff3848ce35bbc75ff4c7edd6b5e1378baa	The two main ways that livestock gain muscle is through nutrition and excercise. Seeing as you already are feeding it high protein feed, I suggest you excercise the heifer. The way that I excercise my show lambs is to run them around their pen in circles until they show signs of exertion. This method will probably work on you heifer.|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	Muscle is obtained by exercising.|`|3fa01c791a959a9aaa587113d993cdd0aa	Part of that is genetics and part of that is maturity.  It sounds like you're already doing the right things.  <br>  <br>  I'm more into horses, and I found that the ones who were in hilly pastures bulked up in the hind parts better than the ones who spent their time on the flat, but I don't know if that would help out with cattle or not.  We had cattle but generally only crossbreds from breeding our milk cow to freshen her and buying a feeder calf or two off of a friend who kept Jerseys and bred his milkers to the same shorthorn bull we did.  We slaughtered them right around 2 so we never really did get to see how much they would muscle up and didn't expect much from half Jersey crossbreds to begin with.

The Xrays will show if this is something that can be corrected by surgery or not.  <br>  <br>  Watch his weight and try to keep him slim and not get heavy that would increase the pain.  Your Vet can also give him some Remedial that helps with inflammation and pain.  This drug is commonly used for hip dysplasia.<br>  <br>  Do not give him any over the counter drugs from the store,|`|23e57bd1ca8f35a8604d6b4cd0dee4c7aa	This is very for your dog. Usually comes from inbreeding. You will have to get him surgery.|`|9cc7893905f5bdf831208e81850a697caa	first thing you should do is run to a new vet...hip dysplasia surgery is extremely succesful especially in younger dogs...why would you discuss putting him to sleep.  They can do full hip replacements and probably help your pup to have a long and healthy life.  Check the hip dysplasia boards on Yahoo, they were very helpful to me when I went through this with my lab...those people can answer any question.  Please make sure you are doing the BEST for your dog...you owe him that much.<br>  <br>  And NO this isn't going to be cheap...but would you put your kid to sleep?  Why would you accept a creature into your home knowing full well you wouldn't do the best things for it.<br>  <br>  In any event, he should probably be on Rimadyl (closely watched for signs of liver ailment).|`|AA11618088	I'm very sorry for what you and your dog are going through.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, this is what happens when dogs are bought from backyard breeders or puppy mills.  Your dog is the perfect example of it.  I'm very sorry for that.  No one should be subjected to this.  <br>  <br>  Do the surgery.  Get him on glucosamine.  Ask the vet for advice.  <br>  <br>  And please, have your husband learn how to locate a good breeder so that you  never have to go through this again.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://dogplay.com/GettingDog/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogplay.com/GettingDog/index.html</a>|`|bf20d1596a080a379eedb6a0fd53c31baa	This is going to get progressively worse. Labs are one of the breeds most known for this. You should have bought from a reputable breeder as they have their pups cleared for this before sale. The vet takes xrays and sends them away to a certified board who examines them and rates. ex.clear, excellent,verygood etc. There is nothing you can do to cure it. Your vet may be able to give something for pain but if your dog is displaying symptoms of this magnitude already it is not going to get very old before you will have to put it to sleep. It would be extremely cruel not to. I'm very sorry. It is an awful hard thing I know. Chalk it up to experience and never buy except from the best. Another prime example of why most every dog should never be bred to begin with.And why are you worrying about expense. You wanted a dog. A dog is a big expense and it is your responsibility to make sure it has any care it needs. That is what you took on when you got the dog.|`|1582946f76cd44202edece4b38f864c6aa	I know that you can give an older dog with joint pain "glucosamine&chondroitin sulfate". It helps with the pain by lubracating the joints.I have terrible knee pain &I use it regulary.It helps a lot. My daughter's King Shepherd (13 yrs old ) used it for two years & ih made him act like a pup again. This isn't a cure but it will help with your baby's pain until  you have to opperate..Good luck|`|26518199cf82eaa09232deffd905585baa	I assume that your veterinarian has been trying products like Cosequin, Rimadyl and other such arthritis treatment. That being said, because his hip problems are so severe, the medications are only going to work so well for so long. You can try to add acupuntcure but again, that's not going to help for very long.<br>  <br>  In cases like this I would highly recommend talking to an orthopedic surgeon. He's clearly in significant pain, and it's not going to get better over time. Hip dysplasia is not something a dog will grow out of, it's something that get's worse over time. <br>  <br>  This may not be what you want to hear, but your veterinarian is correct. Ask for a reference to an othropedic surgeon and make an appointment for a consultation. Follow their advice. I've known a couple of cases that were similar to this and had hip replacement surgery. Once the puppies recovered (and these were close to his age) from the surgery, they were able to run and play like a normal dog. It's expensive, but not extreme in his case. It's a quality of life issue for Sirius|`|326a55166b3e3a1782808e5c8dcf9543aa	You could try giving him glucosomine or hip and joint pills OTC for humans.  That is way to young for this problem to be displaysia, maybe you should seek a second opinion?  There are lots of vets out there!  Good Luck and sorry for the problems your lab is having.|`|41fbace3a35d7b3b723b169b135d2511aa	My sister's rotweiller lived for years with hip dysplasia (just passed away 2 months ago).  She would give her massages on her hips that seemed to help. In order for her to get off the couch, she would drag herself to the end and her hind legs would just fall to the floor. Sis had to massage her hips before she could stand up.|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	You can put it in a doggy wheelchair.  However, I would say surgery would be your best option.|`|7bdb1e8705117bd17ebce87f07bfc538aa	For Sirius to have hip dysplasia at such a young age is unusual but never-the-less unfortunate.  And for him to collapse and not move for hours means that his condition is very severe.<br>  <br>  What is also unfortunate is that surgery would not be a guaranteed cure but, needless to say, a very expensive procedure.  I'm sure your vet would love to perform the surgery $$$.  Follow up treatments would probably be required as would medications that Sirius would need for an undetermined amount of time.  I would never put cost above helping my pet to heal, but if their suffering cannot and will not ever be relieved, then important considerations benefiting the pet need to be made.<br>  <br>  Apparently you love your dog very much, or you would have sent Sirius back in exchange for another.  <br>  But realistically, Sirius is suffering and will continue to suffer the rest of his life.  If you truly love him you will end his pain and suffering as soon as possible.  <br>  And I know this will be a very difficult thing to do, but it is in Sirius' best interest. <br>  I hope that whatever choice you make will be the best thing for Sirius.|`|c40a864a2a630d859a53f5cc9f77182baa	Before you commit to surgery with your regular local vet, you might want to do a little "comparison shopping" for such a "big ticket item". There is a HUGE difference in what vets in different parts of the country charge for their services, depending on the local economy, rental expenses, etc. If you are in a large metropolitan area, for instance, you might do a lot better with a vet in a rural practice. Of course you need to find a vet with lots of experience with this type of orthopedic surgery, but you might save hundreds or thousands of dollars by looking into prices in other areas. <br>  <br>  I just heard on the radio that many Americans are now going to other countries to have surgeries, etc. done that they can't afford to get done here. It is a new kind of "outsourcing". I wonder if  there are veterinary clinics offshore where we could take pets for otherwise prohibitively expensive surgery? (Preferably with no quarantine required!)
d42c34ff42d7b1a4c999f30da1751f64aa	im all about the ethical treatment of animals. But peta takes it overboard big time. They'd rather see humans die than animals. Around here theres  a mink farm that breeds minks for coats and what not. One day all the minks escaped. days later you couldnt go anywhere without seeing a mink in the road that'd been ran over. the ones who didnt get ran over more than likely starved to death or got attacked and eaten by another animal because they dont know how to defend themselves in the wild. Later a peta group fessed up to doing it, and even though most (probably) all the minks were killed, they were still proud that they'd done it. saying "atleast they had a chance to live, unlike in that farm".<br>  <br>  Now granted I dont agree with raising minks for fur, in that farm they were cared for, and fed, and when they died, it was instantly, instead of being ran over, or starving. <br>  <br>  they take situations and blow them way out of porportion. they really are crazy. I do think theyre kind of a cult. If youre looking to join a pro animal group, good for you, but unless your a complete nut, dont join peta!<br>  <br>  Also- when steve irwin died, a peta member was quick to jump on the news and say he had it coming. They say that theyre all about helping animals but if you'll notice, the only place you'll find peta, is where media coverage is huge. they love the publicity,.<br>  <br>  <br>  Peta brings in tons of money each year but I have yet to hear of a case where they actually gave any of that money to help animals. They also give bloody , disturbing images of dead mutilated animals to CHILDREN, so that they'll scare away from eating meat. If you want your kid to be a vegetarian thats fine, but that decision is up to the parents, and the child, not peta.|`|12698dbb5b005f7f7b46ccad798489b8aa	I have to agree with most others, PETA has the right cause but are using the wrong methods.  <br>  <br>  Someone asked a similar question a while ago and I'll repeat what I said then.  At times it takes radical action to bring a cause to public light.  The woman's suffarage movement, for example, did some pretty radical things for their times thought I doubt much of it would raise an eyebrow today.  However as time moves on and people become more aware some groups seem to swing to a more radical stance, which actually does them more harm than good.  <br>  <br>  I've seen the PETAkills site and to be honest I'm as doubtful of their evidence as I am about some of PETA's claims.  Not saying that the numbers aren't right, they're there signed by PETA themselves, but, we have no way of knowing WHY those animals were euthanised.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand I have known cases where smaller groups have asked PETA for some help in gaining publicity for a cause and been totally ignored.<br>  <br>  Personally, I know animals are mistreated every day. I know animals are starved, beaten or have awful testing done on them.  I deal with this in my own way.  I rescue unwanted animals, use products that are cruelty free and try to gently nudge people to become more aware of what pain their lipstick or shower cleaner may have caused.  If I donate, it's to small animal shelters where I know the animals really are the top priority.|`|26959a2082d4badc9dd0164daae5e30aaa	I cannot school you on PETA, sorry.<br>  <br>  What I can say is that all I know is someone is going about facing the hair raising, nightmare making, blood boiling issues of cruelty to animals their business.  You and I can't make it our business, because just as you said...WE CANT HANDLE IT!!<br>  <br>  No one wants to see that stuff! No one wants to know we humans are responsible for those acts. <br>  <br>  Any group that bands together to try to help the poor creatures of the world that human kind is torturing is OK with me..Even if they are radical...PULeez. Don't we need radical changes in this area?<br>  <br>  I am not a member of PETA!  I only know what I've ignorantly ranted above. Forgive me I can't get much closer to the issue than that.|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	There was a statistical record not long ago about how well and what the rating was on each of these organizations.  The statistics for both PETA and HSUS rated very low.  Most of the money has been reported to go to the people that run the facility.  Some of these more famous organizations are not as good as they lead people to think they are.|`|76d8de1375d8a70d70d5d095d240fa88aa	I totally agree with Superfly.....pretty much summed up everything I was thinking. I also donate to my local shelters rather than to larger organizations as someone else suggested and use products that have not been tested on animals. My pets are all rescued....even my horses. I sleep better at night knowing that I do what I can to help the animals, without becoming an extremist.|`|403f1ba7cd02acbb77e0bb1a9363a10daa	Personally, I believe PETA is right (in some respects), but going about solving it in the wrong ways. REALLY wrong ways.<br>  <br>  They are pretty corrupt and pretty extreme. I don't believe that they have a right to run around forcing their lifestyle on unsuspecting 13-year-olds who see the videos of people slaughtering pigs with boxcutters (which is not really how they do it on farms) who then join thinking that they're doing some good.<br>  <br>  I've heard the stories about PETA killing animals to make a point, but I don't believe them. There are some PETA members, though,  who have become sort of "eco-terrorists" and have done things like liberate all the animals in a animal testing lab and proceed to burn it to the ground. These people, unfortunately, sometimes value human life below that of a lab rat. They believe that they're doing some good by making an example of the testing labs. However, what they're really doing is showing the world how passionate about this issue they are and further removing themselves from mainstream society, which gives their plans less of a chance of working. In these respects, PETA is somewhat cult-like.<br>  <br>  What I really hate about PETA though is how they play on people's fears to gain suppourt. It's like those anti-smoking and anti-drug ads which show the disgusting damage to internal organs and say extreme things like "everytime you smoke a cigarrette, you're organs are shriveling up inside you" or "if you smoke marijuana, you'll kill someone while you're high". Sure, it may not be true, but it sure scares people out of doing drugs. PETA basically uses the same strategy to recruit followers. Showing videos of animals being abused or slaughtered inhumanely and proceeding to tell the viewer that he/she is enabling it, that's just worng. It's false suppourt and leaves out many of the important facts, such as most animals are bred in captivity specifically for that purpose and slaughtered humanely to bring food to people's tables, or that animal testing can result in the creation of life-saving drugs for both humans and animals.<br>  <br>  PETA is kind of delusional if they think that they can stop all animal testing and convert everyone in the world to vegetarianism. Sometimes I think they are doing this all just for some attention from the media. Now I'm a pretty liberal guy, stem-cell research is a yes, holy matrimony for gays, and horray for abortion, and I'm all for ethical treatment, but I DO NOT agree with PETA. Make what you will of this statement, but I don't buy into their whole manifesto. It just doesn't agree with me.|`|c0227820f2e346860db7fc930f16205faa	PETA may stand for a good cause, but their cause isn't equality.<br>  <br>  They put animals higher that humans, and they should be teaching that we both come from nature, and both have a righ to be here.<br>  We need to treat animals with respect, we need to stop animal testing, just because they aren't on our same brainwaves doesn't mean they deserve all the s*it we do to them and their homes,<br>  <br>  But that doesn't mean I have to move onto the street so a family of possums can have my house.<br>  <br>  I definately think they have become a brainwashing cult.
63a548cc4a55b7d2d92536e194d07c95aa	Problems with Pet Capuchins: <br>  <br>  1. Young capuchins are very cute and cuddly, however most behavioral problems occur when a juvenile capuchin reaches sexual maturity. They can become very strong and aggressive. Males grow large, dangerous canines. Pet owners can be severely injured from bites. Many pet owners pull out the canines in order to make their pet more "manageable."<br>  <br>  2. Wild capuchins are known as destructive foragers, meaning that when they search for food they tear apart and uproot trees and plants in order to look for food. Just think what they can do to homes! <br>  <br>  3. Capuchins have a complex diet. Most pet owners will not be able to provide their capuchins with the proper nutrition for a healthful life. <br>  <br>  4. Most local veternarians are not trained to take care of exotic pets like capuchin monkeys and frequently deny service to owners of these type of pets. <br>  <br>  5. Capuchins are long lived animals. With proper care and nutrition, they can live over 40 years in captivity. <br>  <br>  6. Capuchins and other nonhuman primates may carry diseases and parasites that can be transmitted to humans. <br>  <br>  7. Capuchins are highly social animals that need to be with their own kind for proper mental and emotional development. Many capuchin owners complain that their monkey has become psychotic and begin biting, scratching and acting very aggresively towards humans. This is mainly attributed to lack of contact with members of their own species. <br>  <br>  8. Many pet dealers illegally breed, import, and sell their animals, and they may not attend to the complex needs of these animals. <br>  <br>  9. Infants are often taken away from their mothers at an early age to be sold as pets. Not only is this traumatic for the mother and the infant, but this can lead to emotional and developmental problems later in the infant's life. <br>  <br>  10. Capuchins cannot be toilet trained. Many are put in diapers which can cause serious rashes and irritations. <br>  <br>  Many individuals who purchase exotic animals, including monkeys and apes, intending to make them in to 'pets' do not consider the following:<br>  <br>  Exotic animals need physical and psychological enrichment; spacious and secure enclosures; companionship of conspecifics, and they have specialized dietary and nutritional needs. Depending on the species, costs associated with responsibly caring for an exotic animal can run in to thousands of dollars a year. Many insurance companies refuse home owner's coverage to those in possession of species deemed 'dangerous'. In many locales, it may be difficult or even impossible to find a veterinarian who is qualified and experienced to handle/treat exotic species. New bills/laws banning private sector possession of wild/exotic animals are being introduced/passed at unprecedented rates (many of these bills/laws do not have "grand fathering" clauses.) Unlike domestic dogs/cats, some animal species (for example, nonhuman primates) can have life-spans of 30-40 years.|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	Did you try using your computer's search engine?

fa1a7af87e47e2bd9b14c5e97484d929aa	i would suggest gridwork...start with small crossrails, simple lines.  the WORST thing u can do is overface ur horse in the beginning.  start small and make sure u have ground rails as reference for her.  as another person said, u need to get her on her backend.<br>  <br>  barrel racing is such a 'forward' style and in the hunter OR jumper ring, you need to collect ur horse and move their balance from their shoulders to their haunches.<br>  <br>  also, i would suggest starting with colored poles.  white is often the most difficult and overfacing color.  use red and white or something along those lines.<br>  <br>  one more thing, i would ALWAYS use poles in between standards.  NEVER simply jump the boxes or flowers or hay bales that you have between the standards because any horse could easily spook or for some reason not jump correctly and hit this object...they dont move, poles do and will injure your horse a lot less.  good luck with everything!! Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  P.S. as far as gettin your horse on her hindend, YOU need to sit in your seat as well.  barrel racing and jumping put a rider in two entirely different positions...find your center of balance with the horse and SIT when approaching a jump.  NEVER catch a horse in her mouth over a jump!  this will completely destroy a horse's perception of what jumping is.|`|232e4e6ba2bc0d7353269ae014be1e89aa	She's used to speed.

You end up feeding less than other feeds and it is chock full of good things. I feed my horses Strategy and for those who need extra, such as my filly, I add Omolene 300 sweet feed to the Strategy pellets. <br>  Is your TB an easy keeper? A lot of TBs tend to be thin. If the Strategy doesn't work, try Ultium - it is better for horses that get "hot" on other feeds, and is an awesome feed. Sweet feed can hype them up if you give too much, so you may have to adjust the feed types to best suit your horse. Still, I recommend Strategy or Ultium.|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	Either the adult or senior feed is fine.|`|AA11046072	Mix 10% protien horse pellets with steamed rolled oats.

If you're going to work him a little harder, add some corn oil and mix well. It's a good way to get thier coats shiny and it provides a little extra fat for energy.

Most are well checks but some sick visits. He/she treats sick animals that he has kept in the hospital. Most Veterinarians have a staff that works with them that answers phones, makes appointments, walks dogs, feeds animals, dispenses medications, cleans hospital and cages, does billing and opens and closes the animal hospital. If this veterinarian is working for someone else, he/she draws a regular paycheck, sometimes with extra for overtime. If this vet is self-employed and owns his/her own business, he/she is part of the company and probably draws a paycheck from his/her own company.

bb083bf20bed6e8b5472929ca09b9b09aa	I sold a mare of mine a few years ago, but early last year I decided I wanted her back. <br>  <br>  I traced where the guy that bought her was living, and since he wouldn't return my phone calls, I made a day trip to his house.<br>  <br>  I just explained that I would really love to buy her back, and that if he was interested in selling, to name the price. <br>  <br>  He said that he didn't want to sell her, but he would keep my details and contact me if he changed his mind. He let me visit her and said I could visit her at any time I like. She was really well looked after and at least then I had the piece of mind that she was in good hands.<br>  <br>  I sold her for $1200, and I was happy to buy her back for the same or a few hundred more (say $1500). I think that was a reasonable ask. If he wanted $3000 for her, I would have had to decline, as she is definitely not worth that much and although I miss her, I am not stupid when it comes to a horse's value.<br>  <br>  What I am trying to say is, expect to pay a reasonably inflated price that matches the approximate value of the horse, but don't get sucked in by a ridiculous price, which some people will try to get out of you because they know they have something that you want!! It may pay to get a person who doesn't know the horse to go with you to see the horse, and then get their opinion as to how much they think it is worth. They don't have the emotional attachment as you do, so they will make a better judgment.|`|AA10628651	That really depends on how bad you want your horse..My husbands ex-wife sold his horse during their divorce and he loved his horse too,he offerd the man more but he wouldnt take it.

Just call, write, or e-mail them and let them know that you are interested in buying back the horse you sold them.  Just leave it open ended saying that if anytime in the future they would like to sell him you would be willing to pay the same amount they paid for him.  Depending on how much you want him you could offer a little more.  You could try offering less, but with a cold call offer it might be kind of hard to convince them of a depreciated value.  You calling them doesn't give you much leverage room on price if you really want him back.  But it never hurts to try.|`|gqjrBmu1aa	If you really want the horse you'd offer to pay more- they'll want more. Just because his training has not progressed in your standards doesn't mean the horse isn't more experienced. If they logged more riding time on him then he did progress in his training. And since they fed him for the past 2 years, paid vet bills, paid for a farrier, and took the time to care for him- I would consider it inconsiderate if you didn't offer a higher price. If you don't, they probably will just sell the horse to someone who will.<br>  <br>  Also another thing is, you sold the horse for a reason- what ever reason it is- you sold the horse. If you wanted the horse sold 2 years ago who's to say you wouldn't buy him back and want to sell him again. That can be risky cause you may not get your money back on him.<br>  <br>  The bottom line- if you want the horse....offer a price. IF you aren't willing to pay a slightly higher price, then you don't really want the horse. Horses aren't like the mall where you can have buyers remorse.|`|2d8b0c53c47255add39eb34444a46e9daa	No it is not rude.  Approach it gently--ask if there would be a possibility to buy it back for the same amt.|`|Fg7DhFOJaa	i believe that saying it is rude to ask to buy your horse back from someone is out of the question.  as far as im concerned u have as much right as any other person to buy him back.  for the price if they want to sell him offer them the same amount they paid and if there not sure about selling him and you extremly want him back offer a lil higher then what they paid and see if you can come to an agreement|`|bXDn9fc6aa	By all means, contact them and let them know you want to buy the horse back.  let them decide the price.  If it's not what you want to pay, come back with another price.  If they have been paying for training (regardless of the outcome of the training) they are going to want more. <br>  As for the feed, ferrier, vet bills that they paid over the past two years, don't worry about having to pay more for those.  Just because someone has a horse for x amount years doesn't mean you can charge more for it because you have put $ to keep it alive.  The price of the horse depends on the breeding stock it came from and the amount of training that it has retained.<br>  I have some friends that have done this sort of thing more than once.  One of our horses we bought from the breeder that had recently bought her back.|`|f7f979166d56e9db52bddbf243ac866daa	I don't think it's rude.  Just bring it up casually that you'd like to be the first to know if they wish to sell him as you'd love to get him back.  I'm sure they'll keep it in mind.  They might say right away that if you wanted him you could get him.  Good luck|`|qUkZcKLJaa	Try 2 get him back! I would offer a bit more than you sold him for so they'll be more likely 2 say ok..

Also, depending on what sort of bedding you choose to line the nest box with, it may need replenshing.  I use a nice soft grass hay and the doe will sometimes eat it and I have to replace it.  But this is what I have found to be best because it makes a nice pocket for the babies to stay in and they can start to nibble on hay when they start investigating their surroundings and chew on their bedding material.|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	It's never too early to put the box in.  She needs to get ready and build her nest.|`|MXwSltOsaa	It would be a good idea to put in the nest box. put some hay in the nest box too. and an advice keep your pet well fed during the first four weeks of her litter because she has to generat milk for the babies. it is not really nessasry to separate the male at the time of birth because my rabbits give birth and the male have never harmed the babies but if u seprate the male it might be a bit more comfortable for the mother rabbit. another advice do not touch the babies or introduce new rabbits or pets around the nest as mother rabbits can easily abandon their babies espicially if it is the first litter, more experinced mothers rarely abondon their nest so if it is the first time dont fell sad if mother doesnt take care well of her litter but the next time she gets babies i am sure she will be a much better rabbit. in addition i keep a nestbox in the cage the whole time even when she doesnt have babies because adult rabbits like to lay in the nest too :) . good luck baby rabbits are really really cute.

Think of something funny, I hope it helps!!|`|f1822e1290acbb5d2252ce9eda8dbcc4aa	I have had a fear of spiders ever since I was little, I have been bitten twice thus far in my life time but not out of malice.  One time I was swinging and smashed one by grabbing the chain and the second time one had crawled into my pants pocket and I rolled him up when I put my hand in and he bit me on the wrist.  Both were non-poisonous.  I think it could be genetically passed down, as my mother is desperately afraid of spiders as well.  I have since found that by studying them in books and learning about them from the Discoverey Channel I am more able to cope and I do not go out of my way to kill spiders unless they invade my space.  I'm not as bad as I used to be but I still do not want one to crawl on me and for those who own Tarantulas, well to each his own.  My brother had one and I would not set foot in his house, especially when he told me it had gotten out of it's cage and he couldn't find it for about a week, until he went to wash his clothes and it came scurrying out of the hamper.  Brrrrr! I still get cold chills thinking about that.  I don't know that I helped you or not but do know that you are not alone.  Try studying them and watching them in their habitats. They are an essential part of the Ecosystem.  They kill off certain insects, thus helping to maintain the harmonious balance of nature.  I hope this helps.  Good luck.

Some horses you can adopt free and many you can find for around $400.<br>  <br>  Because you have to ask, I hope you know what you are looking at for care.  Many people think about the riding aspect of a horse, but they don't think about the things they need and so a horse looses in the long run.  A list of the things a horse needs is as follows:<br>  feed<br>  fresh water daily<br>  hoof care (trim) every 6 to 8 weeks<br>  teeth floating once a year<br>  preventative injections<br>  preventative worming<br>  Psyllium to remove sand from the colon (monthly)--dose needs            to be doubled of the recommended package amount<br>  yearly routine check by a vet<br>  <br>  Many of these horse needs are being ignored.  Each and everyone of the above mentioned is essential to the horse.  I am picking up a 12 y/o horse with 30 y/o teeth and he is skinny.  He, like you, would love to chew his food too.

They are a very social animal.|`|Vsvxx1UIaa	How do you know if they are depressed? And it may be fighting or a showing of dominance. If you won't seperate them there is no way to fix your problem.|`|e1bc9ee12a586a97194ed85c52656355aa	Well first of all, ONLY get them nuetered if you have a small animal vet with an experience in small animals. <br>  If the rearing is constant, take them both out of the cage (floor time) and while your doing that- hose down that cage. Clean everything in it, bedding,toys huts etc. It doesn't matter if you've got wood huts, wash them. Make the cage nuetral. When you put them back in, their scents won't be all over everything.  And since you have 2 males, its probably a good thing to do this every 3-5 days. It should cut down the rearing, and hopefully with a constant cleaning/nuetralizing of the cage, the rearing will eventually settle down. <br>  Also, if you don't have a big enough cage, that might be a cause for more rearing because perhaps they feel they can't get enough of their own space. I made a 60 byt 96 inch cage out of for sale signs you can pick up at home depot. It;s a little bit of work connecting everything and what not, but the bigger the better. <br>  Good Luck, hope I was of some help.
e1bc9ee12a586a97194ed85c52656355aa	First of all, make sure your friend understands the risks involved with Guinea pig birthing and breeding.  MAKE SURE she knows the common complications, and most importantly,  MAKE SURE SHE IS ABLE TO FIND THE BABIES GOOD HOMES!!!  Guinea breeding isn't as easy as 1 2 3. <br>  As far as your male goes, he should be fine. Just when you bring him back, consider giving him a bath to nuetralize the scent of the female and other cage. Re-introduce your two in a nuetral play zone when he comes home, nuetralize the cage you have them in, and toys huts etc .. and they should be fine. <br>  There might be a little bit of fighting due to not understanding what is going on, but nothing too serious.|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	There shouldn't be any difference.|`|AA11335909	He might.  Guinea pigs will often not be able to be kept in pairs, even if the pair grew up together.  It sounds as if your two have been able to continue to live together, but introducing Charlie to a new environment and guinea pig and then bringing him back may disrupt the balance.|`|A2m7UehOaa	it is probably not a good idea.<br>  when charlie returns he will have the scent of the female on him, <br>  and it may cause shadow to get agressive.<br>  it would be pretty much the same thing as having 2 male guinea pigs and 1 female in the same cage.<br>  the males will end up fighting over the female and they could get seriously injured.|`|R2RgChvWaa	if you give charlie a bath, it will wash off the scent of the other guinea pig, if she (or he) even likes the other guniea pig (ur friends) idk, but a bath will work, though most aren't too fond of water|`|Vsvxx1UIaa	No he doesn't see the girl so there is no problem.|`|d8nY7oeraa	well frist off are charlie and shadow both boars?

I saw a boxer recently that is larger than the german shepherd and about the size of a rottweillier.|`|5KZdTMPDaa	It depends.  Boxers are very stocky like the German Rott.  But the American Rott is taller and larger.  I have one who grew to be 155lbs.  German Shepards are not as broad as the other two.  They are more lean, but still large dogs.|`|AA10714921	yea about the same size.. my cousin has two.. they are like up to a 12 year old hips prob. about, i think|`|ZR51sIWFaa	They are not as long and leaner so they weigh less.  They are typically around the same height.|`|ad6c31064d3c1f6155e062d28d688335aa	They are not really smaller in height but smaller in build.<br>  <br>   Boxers are like netiher though. Boxers were bred in Germany from a mix of the English Bulldog and the Bullenbeiser (german bulldog). Originally they were used for bull bating and fighting. GSD's are herders, and Rott's are working/Guard dogs. These dogs may cme from the same country but they are completely different. Although the Boxer has some shaking origins. It is one of the Best family dogs out there. It was used as a courier dog during WWIIand after tat became a supreme family pet. It does well with Children, other animals and has been used as a rescue dog as well. Boxers adapt well to every surrounding, and don't need too much running room. A couple of walks a day will be sufficent exercise. Good Luck! Boxers are a great choice dog.|`|bA0AX6vzaa	That depends some are actually bigger than others but most are smaller|`|e795c380af226b909a5bf667c581efc7aa	Boxers are in height about the same size as german shepards or rottwelliers. Boxers are NOT as broad in the shoulders as a rotty,,,, but Boxers are very sweet ,, loyal dogs that love adults and children. I have one that is 12 years old and she is a wonderful dog. She will bark if someone comes up,, but when told it is ok,,, she immediatly stops barking. Boxers are very easy to house train,,,,,,and a Great Family Pet.|`|kKTHSIleaa	BOXERS ARE SMALLER THAN A GERMAN SHEPARD AND ROCS. THEY WEIGH AROUND 40 TO 60 LBS. SIMILAR TO A LARGE, POODLE. YA KNOW BIG POODLE?|`|r40zR7STaa	Boxers can range from 50-80 lbs. and can be 21-25 inces tall. On average a Rottweiler is 80-135 lbs and 22-27 inches tall. And on average a German Shepard is 75-95 lbs and up to 26 inches tall. So yes, boxers are smaller than those two breeds. If you are looking into purchasing one of those breeds, please do lots of homework and make sure that these breeds fit with your lifestyle and your personality because if you're not careful they can easily become the dominate one and your life will be very difficult.
PBBdapCWaa	Give them a lilttle time to adjust and they will probably come out more.

If they are hiding, you may have a fish that is chasing them.  Keep an eye on them.  Mollies do well with other live-breeders (swordtails, platys, guppys).  I always had a pair of black mollies in my community tanks.  Even though Angelfish are technically considered agressive, I never had a problem with them.|`|AA11306518	Any fish will hide if Chuck Norris is around. Honestly though, they're just getting used to the new surroundings, but you also need to do water changes during the cycling period (the first few weeks a new tank is setup) and add a lot of carbon in the filter to take out Nitrite and Ammonia which are present in a new tank and can kill the fish if there is too much in the tank.|`|2279771fb33f5d69aedcf697505ea4cbaa	they are just getting use to there new surroundings they usually don't hide|`|AA10552075	It could be that they're just getting used to the tank, but the mollies I had always hid in plants and the "fallen log" in my tank

You may want to get her a small stuffed animal to 'take care of'. <br>  <br>  Call the vet back and ask when it's safe to get her fixed.  Schedule the appointment ASAP and until then, be sure she has NO contact with unaltered males.|`|AA10327148	About 80 days..False pregnancy is probably a normal outcome for an estrus period in which mating does not occur, in dogs. Unlike most species, dogs produce progesterone at levels sufficient to maintain pregnancy whether they get bred or not. Therefore, it is likely that many dogs experience at least some degree of "false pregnancy" after an estrus period. It is not an emergency situation. There are medications to suppress the symptoms of false pregnancy but there tends to be a rebounding of signs once the medications are discontinued, so I favor not treating this condition if possible. Most bitches will stop having signs about 80 days after the estrus. They often will produce milk and there can be signs such as nesting behavior or mothering of inanimate objects.  Do watch for signs of pyometra (uterine infection), including drainage from the vulva, increased drinking and urinating, inappetance or lethargy. If these signs occur it would be a good idea to see your vet. Pyometra is more common after estrus than at other times. I don't think that false pregnancy makes a ***** more likely to have pyometra, it is just something to watch out for in any intact female dog..<br>  <br>  Mike Richards, DVM (more about false pregnancy here> <a href="http://www.vetinfo.com/dpregnancy.html#False%20pregnancy" rel="nofollow">http://www.vetinfo.com/dpregnancy.html#F...</a><br>  <br>  Edit: putting cool packs on her tummy may help..but never warm packs..|`|IHKpElQjaa	Good question. My dog had a false pregnancy so we had her fixed and after a month or so we got her a playmate that was smaller in size than her. <br>  <br>  My dog seemed fine after we got her fixed.

AA11901352	I hate to say it but you don't and can't.  SORRY.  I thought mine woudl too but the fact is a female molly is pregie for 5x with only one breeding with a male and can have up to 25 babbies at one time and still be as large as a house.  Don't believe me, I have pics!  She can easily have another 11-20 babies within a week, then another then another.  your tank can soon be over loaded.  She will chase everything in her MOOD.  Wouldn't you after having 11 + kids? Lights will not calm her down, who told you that?  She is ready to go again and again she will go.  Since Mollies are actually salt fish, they will have MORE than yu have seen.  Mine had 20 and is still going.  You cannot stop nature.  Let the lights go.  If you end up with 40 babies, oh well, now you know why yu dont' pay that much for them.  Reproduce, that is why we salt water people keep them, sounds crude, however most babies won't make it past 2 weeks.  This gives our other live eaters a chance.  (Sorry guys the facts!)|`|S27sLUQqaa	fShe is probably hungry and is natural for her to eat as many fry as possible,they MUST be separated.

She will give birth to live fish in batches, and eat them too.....as long as there is a male fish in there she will have lots more..

58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	Can she see other horses when inside her new stable, by which I mean, does the stable have bars which give her access to see her neighbours? I have known a few horses who were fine in such stables to start with, but began to get stressed by the close proximity of the other horses, particularly if they didn't get along.<br>  <br>  Does she now have less, or more, time at liberty in the field?<br>  <br>  Perhaps the people who have her on loan have changed her feed, or training habits.<br>  <br>  The fact that they have contacted you suggests that they are genuine people, and I agree that you are correct in calling the vet.<br>  <br>  I would be concerned if she isn't drinking. Does she now have an automatic waterer, when maybe she had a bucket before? If waterers aren't kept very clean, the water in them can absorb ammonia from the urine in the stable which can cause some horses to go off their feed too.<br>  <br>  It's very difficult to try to determine why your horse would settle so well, yet have a change in her behaviour now. She is either stressed by something in her environment or routine, or it is a medical problem.<br>  <br>  Good luck with finding a solution. It's very worrying when someone else is looking after your pride and joy...|`|8dd0ab93716c3eb4c411bbc9c7fc0178aa	Why UK only?

2FS3ITyvaa	You can often find a good home through a local rescue organization or animal shelter.  Especially since he's so young, still!  People line up for puppies, and since he's full-blooded (and I'm assuming has papers to show AKC registration) you won't have a problem finding a home for him, I'm sure! <br>  You can also place a small ad in the newspaper, or simply make a flyer and bring it to several pet stores, groomers, vet offices, etc in your area to post.  You may even find that an employee in one of those places would be willing to take him.<br>  Good luck, and sorry to hear about your father!|`|7d60c2e4179cf0fe8df7c2b55c02fd32aa	you simple CALL YOU BREEDER!!!!!!  they will gladly take pup back, refund your money and find a decent home for your dog........  HOWEVER,, if you got a pet store/puppymill/backyard breeder dog,,,  you could search BASSET HOUND RESUCE on the internet..........|`|xZy05taKaa	Hmm, The breeder isn't returning your calls? Well, what does the contract say? Does the breeder have a right of first refusal or is there a statement that the dog has to go back to the breeder in such a case? If there is, I suggest that you send 2 copies of a letter to the breeder stating why you have to return the dog. You may not get a refund, though. Send one copy certified to show that you attempted to contact the breeder. If you get no response than try and rehome the dog yourself. Being that it is a 12 week old puppy you might want to put an ad in a paper or on PuppyFind.com. Another place you can put a free ad is on Craigslist (puppyfind ads are not free). Craigslist will only allow you to ask a normal adoption fee though. You should have no problem rehoming a 12 week old Basset, especially in California. There is a shortage of smaller dogs in California right now because of horrible anti dog legislation being promoted by the Animal Rightists. In fact it is currently estimated that 10,000 puppies are being smuggled into California across the San Diego border to meet the demand because of the small dog puppy shortage out there.|`|3a4d50e8e118369490fac9bd80ee3191aa	you said you are driving back and forth to kentucky, i am in ky and would love a basset puppy. if you want, contact me and we can work something out. thanks|`|48f5279840d73a57dc7aadc85066e648aa	Where are you located?

I ended up taking a bunch to the shelter to be euthanized because it got out of hand.|`|CBmLrkCbaa	Yes, that is fine.  Just don't breed any of the babies to each other.  Rats go into heat every 4 days.  There is no way of knowing when.  Just leave the male in there with them for a week and you'll be guaranteed of some babies.  If you don't want to leave him there, then just throw him in there for an hour every day for a week.
6HGHqJHUaa	Define "fighting"??  Do they stand on their hind legs and "box" each other?  Is there a lot of idignant squealing? Does the loser end up get groomed?  If so then this isn't truly fighting, it's squabbling. There's a difference. <br>  <br>  All rats will squabble, even siblings. Now, if there's absolute shrieking, fur flying, a submissive rat cowering in in the corner or taking cover, then you have a problem and will probably have to separate them long term.<br>  <br>  How long has the behavior been going on?  If they are sisters, have the peacefully coexisted up until now?  They may be hitting puberty and establishing a pecking order (hormones and all).  <br>  <br>  Try adding an additional food dish on the other side of the cage (is the cage large enough for 2 rats?) and make sure they have enough food.  Check out the cage calculator to make sure the cage is adequate:<br>  <br>  www.rattycorner.com/odds/calc.shtml<br>  <br>  If both rats are healthy, and the cage is large enough I would see how things progress.  Keep an eye on them for a couple days and see if it passes.  Remember, rats wrestle and sometimes their play looks like fighting to us.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Pb2Djvfyaa	Do rats come in "heat"?

Everytime he barks , squirt him in the face and say 'NO' firmly. If he is barking outside you can get a collar that works the same, its noise activated so when your dog barks he gets a spray of citronella .

I do this to stop my two dogs from wrestling, they see the can they stop.  I have yet to try it for barking, but will be trying this technique as they bark a lot at people in the yard or other dogs and cats.<br>  <br>  I've enclosed two articles on barking you might want to try the first one is where I got the information on the shake can, the second article is another method.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.

AA10163496	This is the afterbirth or the delivery of the placenta!  All mamals deliver in this way, including humans.  First the kitten is delivered and then the afterbirth.  There will be one placenta for each kitten (unless your cat has delivered identical twins that share a placenta - very rare.)  It is normal for the mama-cat to injest the placenta to remove any trace of her giving birth.  This is an instinctual behavior designed to protect her kittens from being discovered by predators.  If you can take it from her before she eats it, that would be preferrable but you have to be real quick or she will eat it before you even notice.  Please recommend to your neighbor that she shoudl get her cat spayed after she has fully weaned the kittens.  Also the kittens should be with their mother for a full 12 weeks.  That is best for their health & well-being.  Good luck.|`|dffe71945543b983d341d68ec62f46d7aa	<a href="http://cats.about.com/cs/pregnancybirth/a/pregnancybirth_3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/cs/pregnancybirth/...</a><br>  I would suggest a visit to the vet asap.|`|HeyxOJAMaa	EW.

a81f3190cab64e33cf1b60ec2b9e8c16aa	I don't think she is too young! <br>  <br>  I think you should start her in English. English will help her to develop good balance as she grows up, as you need more balance to ride English than Western because the English saddles aren't as supportive.  They do make small saddles (in both disciplines) for young children so they don't have to worry about not being able to give their horse commands. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about the size of the horse. Often the ponies tend to be harder to ride than a horse! Ponies are often stubborn and have attitudes. The riding establishment that you pick will choose the best horse for your neice. They will also have the correct tack. If they don't provide helmets, you can find children's helmets at your local tack store. <br>  <br>  When you go to a lesson, make sure she is wearing a boot with a small heel (like 1") and jeans. <br>  <br>  Just check with local barns in the area to make sure they allow young children in the lesson program. Some places probably have age limits. <br>  <br>  I think introducing riding at an early age is a great idea!|`|2xRMYebnaa	With supervision a 5 year old can learn much about riding...especially if SHE wants to do it! At 5 years, the child's attitude can make all the difference.<br>  <br>  I would recommend beginning with Western because the saddle is much deeper and the addition of the horn will help her to learn to balance.  <br>  <br>  Depending on her progress with basic ground work, you can begin English as early as 7 or 8 years of age, when their balance and concentration is much more improved.<br>  <br>  Please make sure the pony (for a 5 year old) is of good temperament and is 'bomb proof' to make her early riding experiences positive ones. That way you set her up for confidence and success.<br>  <br>  -RVT<br>  (Registered Veterinary Technician)|`|389c7ca909ed8e7d45814f58d66fe8bbaa	No, I was 18 months old the first time my mom put me on a horse.  By 2 yrs old, I was riding solo with her walking next to the horse.  I rode an Arabian gelding about 15-16 hands high.  I learned bareback to start with a bit and rein but never had the chance to learn by saddle.  The farm got sold and we moved to where live stock wasn't permitted.  I think western would be better for the balance and it will help build up her upper leg strength also.  It's been over 25 years since I've even been around horses except at state fairs.|`|AA11139360	Try to find something low key.  My mom used to give lessons to some little kids about that age and they were very basic...learning how to brush the horse, taking care of the horse, and some basic games and walking just to get their balance.  It really helps kids, and they get to grow up learning a lot about horses and it's a lot of fun, but they don't have a really competitive surrounding.  My mom started her students out with an Australian saddle, it was more to get used to the balance than to actually teach them the fundamentals of riding.  That's pretty much what you want to build.  As long as kids grow up with a strong emphasis on seat and position they will grow up to be the best riders.|`|nETbDWdBaa	not at all go for it she will have a blast|`|ncyiMqinaa	heck no...its not too young.. i rode in my first show when i was 5..  i started out in western to learn how to balance.. then go to english.. its so much fun!|`|yOYPwCsOaa	I think five is a good age, it's young enough she will develope a deep love for horses, and old enough that she can still follow directions to a point.

We have therapeutic riding for children that young where I live. Make sure that there are enough instructors and the horses are gentle. Western or English should be fine. What a nice Auntie you are!|`|AA12306645	Wow, yes, rather young, and western, if I were you, and a small horse, very quiet (we call them "bomb proof") please.  And don't bother until you have the $$ to be sure she has lessons 2 or three times per week.... you are just wasting your money otherwise.  Frankly, I like kids a little older.... 5 year old children just don't have the strength or the leverage to convey too much to a horse, and I wouldn't put my worst enemy on a Shetland pony, as lots of people do.  Eight is better but if she is already bitten by the horse bug,...... tuff if she really wants to ride.... and 10 is just super.  Kids at 10 are strong, legs long enough to properly cue a horse, and their balance is almost that of a 13 year old.  At ten, they are literally sponges, and ride well in no time....|`|O6EMwFJYaa	My daughter was 2 when she first sat on a horse 4 when she started lessons 13 before we finally acquired a horse (We now have 3) She is now 17 and doing an equestrian course at a nearby college|`|c3d220cabbc32f1d84c682c54f03b361aa	Starting her at five is a GREAT idea.

That kind of stuff its not only unconfortable for the rider but the horse too.

Ella tendrá sus cachorros y los amamantara por lo que sus tetillas se harán grandes, esto es normal después de un mes aprox. depende de la cantidad de cachorros ella misma los retirara ya que también las lastiman después de este tiempo. al retirarle a los cachorros tendrás que exprimir sus tetillas con cuidado y con mucho cari?o y poner lienzos empapados con agua caliente cuidado de no quemarla solo calientitos y alternar con lienzos  helados con agua muy fría estos contrastes harán que los músculos comiesen a regresar a su normalidad esto tienes que hacerlo en la tarde y en la ma?ana por unos 3 o 4 días recuerda que para ella sera molesto solo habla le y quierela mucho|`|MZSWNtT8aa	si le da de mamar alos perritos si amor|`|fb4a933e64f019399888eca071d8ec9eaa	Ponle una faja Post-natal'''|`|lzpFAUTvaa	se les cuelga un poco las boobies...<br>  <br>  si si, yo se ke se oye feo y askeroso, pero, es la realidad, yo tenia tambien una perra de esa misma raza y nunca se le compusieron las boobs...<br>  <br>  pero, si no la cruzas se puede volver agresiva... es su naturaleza...|`|nL0ojtNbaa	no creo<br>  por ejemplo:si tenes 1 manzana y tenes 2 no se pùede entendez??|`|f0397c58629dfc033f486b5e492f828daa	En general no se deforman, salvo que haya engordado mucho en su embarazo.

a53360fdb26e99ce45bfe7cfd1e2cc5aaa	tu perro aulla porque esos sonidos le recuerdan a la llamada de los perros, son sus genes de lobo. Lo que puedes hacer son varias cosas, siempre que veas que tu perro empieza a aullar llama su atencion, llamalo y dale una buena caricia, juega con el, todo con tal de desviar su atencion. Entralo en casa y cierra el balcon. Otra cosa que puedes hacer es coger su hocico, con firmeza pero sin fuerza y bajale la cabeza y dile en tono seco y firme Calla, o No. y sueltale. No le haras da?o y actuaras como otro perro.

XfU38DGYaa	If his breath was really stinky he may have an infected tooth that needs to come out.  If you get him, have your vet check his teeth right away.  Some horses won't eat very well with a bad tooth, so if he is really skinny that could be a cause of lethargy.  There are many things that cause lethargy other than that - it sounds like the horse needs a very good vet check to see why he's sick.  Kidney stones aren't that common in horses, and often horses can be fine with them until they develop renal failure (which is a cause of lethargy).  Some bloodwork would help to rule out kidney disease, and possibly help show any other cause for the lethargy/depression.|`|qq0vI5ojaa	I dont know about kidney stones in horses, in people they just hurt A LOT and reduce kidney function. Pain from kidney stones could be causing the lethargy and depression but it seems more likely that there are other problems - i would get it seen by a vet asap. There wasnt any sign of laminitis was there? that makes them not want to walk.

Take him outside, put the leash on him, and stand there for a bit let him get used to it.  Pretty soon he will want to sniff and do things, When he starts to walk, look straight ahead, and make him walk next to you...dont say much to him until you are back home, and then really praise him for a good walk ( treats help too) good luck, I had this happen once with a dog and did this, it worked great.  Good Luck|`|q5iZHImoaa	He is scared and has probably never been on one before. You should let him get used the having the leash on before trying to walk him. Just hook it too him and let him be for a little while every day for several days, then try putting it on him,Once he is used to it, and calling him (not Pulling) where you want to go, eventually he will get the idea.

K27elbnXaa	I'd call the vet and ask for advice. You would not be overreacting by taking the cat to the vet as a URI can be contageous and you don't want that. However, stuffiness can be from seasonal allergies and that usually does not require a trip to the vet. Once again I think you should call for advice so you can go if you need to but have peace of mind if you don't need to go.|`|46jUarNiaa	Call your vet to be sure. I think the vet will say to not bother bringing in your cat just yet.

AA11869342	It is left over from when they were kittens kneading their mom to get more milk to come out.  It is a comforting act to kittens and cats,  so many cats carry it over to their adult lives.  I have 3 cats but only 2 of my cats knead.  I think it calms them and relaxes them (the ones who still do it as adults)|`|eccd90cc9769ce5634ad735ffd713f0aaa	It is also a calming technique to settle themselves down.|`|3jYZS03Jaa	when cats where kittens they would push/knead their mothers stomach to produce more food for them to drink. resurch has shown that cats that are kept witht heir mother wont do this so that test resulted in the answer that kneading something before they relax is a way of being remonded of their mum|`|9oUW3iU5aa	I think cats knead because it takes them back to when they were nursing.<br>  I don't know whether they feel comfort by kneading but I let my cat do it.

She also seems to find it pleasurable??|`|OKSR0MXhaa	that and it just makes them feel content. like happy and feels comfortable and safe.|`|ZFPxwvJ7aa	Mimicking kneading breast for milk.

PcbUXQvyaa	JRTs are very high energy dogs, they require a lot of exercise.  Many times, aside from typical puppy chewing behavior, dogs pent up energy will manifest itself in frustrating behaviors, such as digging, chewing or even aggression.  Start taking your puppy on regular and frequent walks.  Play a game of fetch or run with him.  A tired dog is a happy dog.  He needs to have an outlet, otherwise he may be destructive.  Puppies also need to be supervised, so that these behaviors can be addressed.  If you are unable to supervise your dog, then he should be kenneled.  Aside from ruining your things with his chewing, he could also ingest something that could make him very sick, require an expensive surgery or could possibly kill him.<br>  <br>  Exercise, exercise, exercise.|`|OG0J4DSQaa	Must discipline him, give him some chew toys (rotate them), other options are let him chew on dried bones, this can entertain him for a long time. Also, JRTs are active dogs, they need lots of exercise. So make sure you exercise him daily b4 you leave the house (e.g. run/walk) so he feels tired for the day.<br>  <br>  Make sure you stop him each time he is caught in the act and punish him. Be consistent|`|8r5sA18Iaa	at pet stores you can find a sour spray you can spray your furniture he bites, so the next time he bits it, he tastes that icky sour taste : )<br>  i used it on my dogg, adn he hasn;t bit anything since becuase now he thinks everything is going to taste like it!<br>  the good thing about the spray is it has no smell it only has a wicked strong/baddd!! taste : )<br>  <br>  hope your furniture stays unchewedd
AA10029366	Sorry, no. The only time any one of my Siberians wears a harness is when they're pulling a sled. Other than that, they are trained to behave on collars.<br>  <br>  I see putting a harness on a pet dog as a way of condoning the fact that it's going to drag you around, rather than training it not to.<br>  <br>  I would  not tie a dog up in a harness because, as someone else said, they can easily wiggle out of them...it's not the same situation as you having a leash on the walking harness and being there to supervise. All they have to do is get a little tension on the tie-out and they can back right out of the harness.<br>  <br>  Your only real option for tying out is a well-fitting collar.<br>  <br>  Isn't there anyone you could ask to stay home with your dogs? Having all of those dogs loose in the car -- what happens if you get into an accident?|`|8X082V81aa	If u absolutely have no choice, the dog would need to have a long leash. I am not a beleiver of chaining dogs! But if you have to, make sure he has atleast 25-30 feet,more if possible. The harness should be fine as long as he does not chew it off.<br>  Crating would be safer, but uncomfortable for long periods of time.|`|Bw18seFqaa	no its not safe to use a harness with a tie out.  A dog can wiggle out of a harness if he wants to badly enough.  For some reason also, the tieouts seem to get tangled more easily with a harness than with a collar.<br>  <br>  If I was in your situation, I'd opt to have my dogs boarded, or get a trusted friend/family member to come check on them a few times a day.|`|eCYcFEmYaa	oh yes! when my siberian husky was a puppy, we had a harness for her and she was much more controllable. then we switched to a collar and it all went downhill then. when she went for a walk, she would be pulling and choking herself so again we swapped to a harness. she walks so much better now and as you said, behaves better. <br>  <br>  we use her harness in the car but as we have fences in our yard, we have never had to tie her up or anything. if you are worried about ur puppy being in a collar and escaping go with what your gut tells you to do. i cant imagine that the harness and chain will do any damage considering its pretty much like you having it on a leash.  i would use the harness but just try to have someone checking up on your puppy while its on the chain and harness if you are not able to.<br>  sorry about the circumstances you are having to go through|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	I wouldn't but.. Then I wouldn't leave any dog tied up at all... Ever. Can you take a crate to your uncle's house and crate the dog while he is there? Would be safer.
OUgf4EeJaa	Even if a vet is not near by you should call one. You can try and figure it out yourself with info online but I wouldn't suggest it as you could be wrong. Better to make a simple, two second call then put your dog at risk. :/|`|YJmGf4RLaa	the dog needs a vet regardless of how far you have to drive.  this is not something you or anyone can correctly diagnose nor treat.   you can't get the proper meds without a prescription no matter what it is.|`|ldfE9vNGaa	Unfortunately rottweilers have a pre-disposition to hip dysplasia and it sounds as if your rottie, even though he's young, could be suffering from this type of problem.<br>  <br>  It's unusual for it to strike right out of the blue though. Has he suffered from stiffness, limping or 'hopping', discomfort when standing in one place (often seen as moving from one back leg to the other to re-distribute the weight he's supporting), whimpering or pulling away when touched in the rear hips, legs etc?<br>  <br>  If so, he could well be having some serious joint problems. Do you know if his parents were OFA certified? (this is basically a procedure that tests the hip joints in dogs and grades them in terms of how healthy and well-formed they are)<br>  <br>  There could, of course, be other reasons for his discomfort too. There's no way to diagnose something like that yourself and whatever is causing the problem it definitely needs some veterinary assistance. I'd suggest you take him to your regular veterinarian as soon as possible so that you can get a proper diagnosis and get started on appropriate treatment right away.<br>  <br>  good luck
Sfqe1EICaa	my dog had seizures  and all i could do for her is sit and pat her and let her know i was there.<br>  <br>  Its very sad to watch it happen to them<br>  <br>  I the end the seizures did kill her<br>  <br>  I just found this info if its any good<br>  <br>  During the Seizure:<br>  <br>  - Some dogs are light or sound sensitive during seizure episodes. Try dimming the lights and keeping phones at a distance from the dog.<br>  <br>  - Keep old towels or baby diapers handy to catch urine if your dog urinates during seizures.<br>  <br>  - Some human epileptics say they have an easier time if the seizure is allowed to run its course. Calling the dog's name to bring them out of the seizure may not be the best thing for your dog. Try it each way and see which is more comfortable for your particular dog's seizure.<br>  <br>  - A fan blowing on the dog, or rubbing the feet and belly with cool water may help cool the dog down. Of course, in any case should the dog seem to be overheating due to repeated seizures or not coming out of a seizure -IMMEDIATELY bring the dog to/or contact a vet since overheating can be very dangerous.<br>  <br>  - Many dogs are confused and even blind right after a seizure. Keep the dog in a safe area where they cannot fall down stairs or hurt themselves.<br>  <br>  - Keep a careful journal of the seizures. As soon as possible write down the exact time the dog started to seizure and the time the seizure ended. A stop watch or watch with a second hand can be helpful. After the seizure is over and you have time - write down all circumstances surrounding the seizure, such as unusual food eaten, activities that happened during the previous day, medications or vaccinations recently given. A detailed journal can be helpful when bringing your dog to a new vet or neurologist.<br>  <br>  - Be prepared to transport a dog that cannot stand up and walk, or is even in the middle of a seizure. Hard plastic children's sleds can be used to carry or drag the dog to the car. A heavy blanket folded can also act as a stretcher. If you are alone with a very heavy/large seizing dog, call the vets office for instructions. Depending on where you live you may want to try calling the police for help in getting the dog into the car if no one else is available.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Safety:<br>  <br>  - Seizure proofing your home is important since most of us cannot be there to watch our dogs at all times. Seizures may occur when the dog is home alone. Many people crate their dogs while they are not there. An airline type crate (Vari-Kennel or Furrari) minimizes the chances of the feet getting caught up in the wires.<br>  <br>  - While crating, or even when leaving the dog home alone, make sure the dog is not wearing a collar (especially with tags) that could get caught while the dog is thrashing. Choking can result.<br>  <br>  - Some people make a special room for the epileptic dog, clearing out any objects/furniture that may injure the dog during a seizure. Crating or making a 'doggy room' may be the best idea should you have a 'catapulting dog', that is one that throws itself across the room during seizures.<br>  <br>  - Never leave an epileptic dog alone near any water deep enough to drown in. If you need to, investigate getting a doggy lifevest for your dog.<br>  <br>  - If you are concerned about your dog seizing while swimming, doggie life vests are available.<br>  <br>  - Protection or separation may need to be considered in multiple dog households. A seizing dog can trigger the 'pack' instinct in which an injured animal on the ground is attacked. Monitor your dogs until you know their reactions to the seizing dog.<br>  <br>  - Baby gates can be invaluable to block off stairways or confine the dog to a certain room.<br>  <br>  - Be careful of leaving windows open should you have a dog that spends time near one. Screen windows can easily fall out of the framing as well as your dog.<br>  <br>  - Prop a large piece of styrofoam insulation against a sliding glass door if you are afraid of your dog hitting against it.<br>  <br>  - Buy a new or used baby alert monitor to 'hear' your dog if he sleeps in a different part of the home. Just put the receiver part in your bedroom -this may help you sleep better if you are constantly trying to 'listen' to hear if the dog is all right.<br>  <br>  - If you really want to know what happens when you are not home, buy a voice activated tape recorder. It only records when significantly loud noise is heard. This will not only let you know if your dog has seized, but if he has been barking all day. Some also videotape their dog during the time they are gone. They then fast forward thru the tape to see if anything unusual has happened during the day.<br>  <br>  - Keep phone numbers to your vet and all emergency vet hospitals near all phones. 2:00 a.m. in the morning is not he time to decide if your dog is in status and then figure out what to do. Drive by the emergency vet so you know exactly where it is. When traveling, get emergency numbers in advance or immediately find the hospital nearest you when you arrive. Keep the number handy at all times.<br>  <br>  - An ID tag on a lost epileptic dog is very important. It's scary enough to think of a lost dog, but a lost dog without medications is even worse. Medical alert tags are available at most pharmacies, pet supply catalogs or from your vet. It can even be engraved and worn with your dog's regular tags.<br>  <br>  - Train all your dogs for basic obedience. You may need it someday if you are walking multiple dogs and your epileptic seizures. The situation would be much easier if the other dogs will obey a sit or down stay.|`|q9BItD25aa	I had a chocolate lab who started having seizures when he turned 7yrs. old.It was heartbreaking. He was on all kinds of meds..nothing was helping. When he had a seizure I would  stay with him, trying to comfort him.  Finally we had to have him put to sleep..and we waited much too long to do this because we couldn't bear the thoughts of it. The Vet didn't charge us that much money, and he even gave us a lot of the pills for free because we had been going to him for years.<br>  He told us Labs are prone to seizures. My heart goes out to you. Good luck.|`|d9ee1dddc4ed204c9194ac176a094488aa	i have a yorkie who at 11 and a half has had epilepsy for most of his life(his granma had it but sadly died while fitting back in 98 and i lost a gsd 10years bk who also died despite meds x), he can go months without fitting then he will have tonnes of fits in one day, the vets arent overly worried as he doesnt have them on a daily basis , when he does tho he likes to sit on my lap, he dribbles loads and has accidents indoors after, we dont talk to him as he goes blank while fitting so we give him time to come round and within 10 minutes of fitting hes back to his normal self my 2 greys dont get spooked when hes fitting they watch him and then go and check hes ok..bless, the vets will charge a huge ammount if meds are needed daily so keep a diary of his fits and you can note down any changes that occur from one fit to the next xx

There's also some for a little more money that has a thermostat control on it, so you can set it for say 80 F, and it'll only kick on when the room temp is about that.  At the very least, get a fan for the dog or one of those cooling pads-but I don't know how well they work.|`|SPQLKitYaa	Since AC units are a bit pricey, try buying a cooling dog collar. Just google it an d order one of the internet. Also, you can maybe put those cooling blocks in the dogs beds. Also just buy some fans, especially the ones that add a bit of spray into the air.<br>  <br>  Good Luck,<br>  Charlotte|`|l2otlRDQaa	you can try buying a mini-fan. like those table-top kind. i bought 2 mini-fans for my 2 dogs (chow chows) and they love it! i dun have to worry about them feeling the heat when its summer and im out at work. and when i get home, ill play with them in the yard by splashing water. this will help them to feel cool as well =)|`|538697f9ea99f1a43703ed7fdec71c2caa	Make sure they have access to heaps of cool water.|`|eLBM6qtiaa	I have a dog also and i observed that Nero during hot days loves to lie on a moist ground.  So what i did was i wet a part of our garden just to keep it a bit moist and added some shades like pot plant and i place fresh water i everyday into his drinking pot and it really works. If you don't have a garden you may use a rag keep it moist for your dog to lie down.|`|ewR5DSdTaa	Buy a couple little fans to put around the house.  Also make sure there is plenty of water.  A/C units are usually expensive and they are not very energy efficient since you'd have it on all day while you are at work.  The only problem with the fans though, is if the fan is bigger than the dog, it might scare it...so keep that in mind.|`|dffe71945543b983d341d68ec62f46d7aa	Just check around for the smaller units. Generally a 5,000 BTU A/C can keep one room really cool and costs around $100.<br>  <br>  Check local yardsales, thrift stores and <a href="http://www.craigslist.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.craigslist.org</a> for anyone who may be giving away/selling one of theirs. <br>  <br>  Usually around this time of year, you'll get a few people moving out of areas who may not need their A/C's anymore. <br>  <br>  If your dog has very long hair, you may want to consider a grooming trip to shorten it a bit. <br>  <br>  Lots of  available cold water is always a must.  If you can find a dog water dispenser, this would probably be best however.  You can also stick ice cubes in the dispenser to help keep the temperature cool.  <br>  <br>  Make sure that there are some nice shaded areas of the house, where your dog can rest if he needs to. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|12e67832e3db94d47bafc734b06e4b47aa	You can get the table top fans that move left n right. I have a paddle pool in my garden for them to splash in, you know the kiddy ones you get in different shapes they have a lid with base one has water in one has sand in, god they love that.<br>  <br>  You could also get a ceiling fan They have 3 speed settings, depending on the size of room they were in I would get a 42" leave on either 1 or 2 speed.
dd7b4f95729f7be7106213b317080745aa	Well if you are talking saltware eels, then yes they are GREAT escape artist so lids are a must. Temp is pretty standard for a salt tank. They are pretty hardy. Keep in mind that they are poop factories especially when they get larger so you will need a TON of filtration such as a GREAT protien skimmer, etc.<br>  <br>  They do make great pets though...I miss mine greatly. A zebra moray is a very good eel to start with. They are more dosile and don't try to escape as much. I had a three foot one that I hand feed and would try to rub on me like a cat when I had my hands in the water moving things around. Not saying you should try this because they can and will bite; but they are really cool pets.<br>  <br>  Give them lots of caves and places to hide and that will help on the escaping and carpet surfing attempts.|`|9zIoRPe1aa	Check out these different species & descriptions.

jjAn44zwaa	You can use many methods to kill the ich however it will most likely never be completely gone. <br>  <br>  You cannot use copper in your tank because of your hermit crabs.  Many hermit crabs are sensitive to copper medication.   If you have another tank you can set up a hospital tank or quarantine tank.  There you can do all your meds and such without harming the rest of your tank.  I prefer a formalin dip if the infestation is bad enough.  You have to follow the directions very closely though as it can be quite toxic.   Freshwater dips are also effective at quickly reducing an outbreak.  These can be stressful to the fish though so unless it's a bad outbreak it's usually better to use a quarantine tank or just let the fish fight it off on his own.  The only way you can truelly rid a marine tank of ich is to keep the tank fish free for a month and treat all the fish in a seperate tank with hyposalinity for a month before reintroducing them.<br>  <br>  If it is only a small infestation like you are describing I work on maintaining the water quality high and lowering any stress on the fish.  The ick will only becomes visible in the small white specs if the fish gets stressed.  Usually as the fishes stress goes down they fight it off themselves.|`|w07AUmeBaa	Tangs are very subseptible to ich... keep an eye on your temps etc.  Most med's are a pain as you end up upsetting your biological balance... if you are brave enough you can try a freshwater bath.|`|UHoNNuypaa	it may be just natural markings on the tang, and the lighting may be htting the chromis differently.

This is what colour spectrum is found ambiently around the equator.<br>  <br>  It all depends what you are trying to achieve.

d547670eb307c7bad5464024e5899d5eaa	yes I would worry.  Most likely the dog swallowed larger chunks of the bone and therefore - since it is not natural - it will not be able to digest it.  Call the vet/emergency vet.  A lot of times, you can watch the dog for 72 hours.  A conservative vte will tell you to simply watch the dog and if it appears in distress, then bring it in.<br>  <br>  Rawhides are a problem for the same reason, the dog tends to swallow large chunks which can cause digestive problems.<br>  <br>  Pigs ears are very natural and should be ok for a dog.<br>  <br>  Bones are also ok as long as they aren't cooked (cooking makes them more brittle and likely to splinter)<br>  <br>  Hooves can split as well (depends on how they are processed). <br>  <br>  Generally speaking, any chew toy should only be given to dogs such that they chew and  they are supervised.  If splitting or cracking of the chew toy or hoof or bone occurs, the smaller pieces should be taken away immediately.<br>  <br>  Any small piece of the chew item should be removed, natural or not as the dog can swallow that whole and be unable to digest it.  They will either vomit it up (which can cause esophogeal damage) or it can cause an obstruction).<br>  <br>  Do all dow owners supervise - no.  We give our 3 dogs hooves while in their kennels during the day.  It's not a wise idea though!|`|lKEBesbuaa	my dog ate bits of a nylabone when he was a pup and was ok so dont worry too much just take the rest away and keep an eye on him for any signs he is not right eg. vomiting.<br>  <br>  as for raw hide chews, i have never had a problem with any of these and my dog loves both them and pigs ears! <br>  <br>  i have never given him the hooves before so cant comment on those|`|7dixSECQaa	I can't say about the nylabone. they are supposed to not be degradeable like that. I would call the company rep and see what they say. As for regular bones, they help dogs teeth and gums. just don't give them fish or fowl bones. Anything small that can lodge in their esophagus. Always remember, if you have given your dog a bone, and they show signs of choking, get them to a vet asap. If they are fine, don't worry about it. As long as their eyes stay bright, and their gums stay pink/grey, they are doing good. And of course, passing what they eat as well.|`|QRaKJAjXaa	the only kind of bone i give my dog is called a Bully Stick. It is the only bone that the dogs can actually digest.

She has handled hers.  Holds them, rubs their bellies, feeds them out of her hand.  This has helped with them running away when she is near the cage.  She has them in a big cage made of plywood and plexiglass.  This works out for them.  They do tend to spend alot of time in hiding tho. Here is a site for you to check out:<br>  www.repticzone.com  they have information from others who have them too.  Good luck.
cZ3kj9Wmaa	It really depends on how big the little guy is... if he's the size of your fist, he shouldn't given water for swimming in.  A shallow bowl that allows cleaning himself is fine.  During their first few weeks they lack the water repelling feathers to keep themselves dry.  Heat lamp is great, should be between 85 and 90 degrees.  Once he starts staying on the other end of the tank, it's either too hot or he's not in too much of a need for it anymore.  Chick feed.  A self watering system (or you'll be refilling that water bowl nonstop).  And a constant supply of fresh towels, as during the first few weeks it's vital in getting their little legs strong.  Hay will cause stumbling, slick surfaces like glass will cause splay leg.  And lots of love, especially if you intend on making him a pet, as ducks are a social creature... they're better in pairs!|`|d3eodo9Paa	Make sure that the light isn't on him all the time, the duck should be able to get in or out of the light as he chooses.  <br>  <br>  Your duck needs water, but not that he can sit in, they are easily chilled when they still have their down feathers.  <br>  <br>  Ducks can eat chick starter if you can't find anything for ducks.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!  and your duck would probably prefer to be outside PROTECTED as opposed to the bathtub.|`|AA11592814	What kind of duck? With the heat lamp make sure the duck does not over heat. You can go the a feed store near you and get food for it. you might also want to talk to the wild life agent in your area about the duck.|`|RmSQIc0Vaa	Here is one of the best websites for info on orphaned ducklings and goslings. As it says, "Fostering or reuniting mallards is not successful." This means that if you take the duck and put it with other ducks, it will be rejected. <br>  <a href="http://www.willowbrookwildlife.org/GuidesDetail.asp?id=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.willowbrookwildlife.org/Guide...</a><br>  <br>  Also, as that website states, remember that it is illegal to have a wild mallard without the proper permits. "All native birds are protected by the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty Act. It is illegal for any person to possess nesting material, egg(s), feathers, bones or a live bird without the proper permits from U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. It is also illegal to harm or kill a protected bird species and it is illegal to remove or destroy nesting material. The law does not protect three birds, they are; Pigeon (rock dove), English house sparrow and the European starling."<br>  <br>  <br>  The best thing to do with an orphaned mallard is to contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator.

8OFzYXYVaa	For an 11 year old, this will be an excellent way to learn responsibility, know some steps to running a business & earn your neighbors trust while playing with pups & making some money!   <br>  <br>  because you probably dont have all the technical business stuff like insurance, paperwork, etc, you'll most likely just be walking some of your neighbors dogs, people you aready kinda know. Id say only walk 1 dog at a time for a while while your getting used to the different leashes & dog strengths, & $5.00 per walk is a reasonable price. If people have more than 1 dog, add $1.00 for each extra dog in the family. If you really like the job, know that people CAN make a living dog walking full time!

Have you ever thought of dog knapping? You discreetly take someone's dog and care for it until you see reward signs posted in the neighborhood. Wait at least two days (make sure you write down the number right away though) and then call them. Boast about how you saw the poor little thing running down the street and you rescued it from getting hit by a car. Then you nursed it until you saw the sign. It's all gravy after that!

Pues yo comencé como vegetariano a los 8 agnos. Ya no podía ver un animal muerto en mi sopa, ni en mi plato. Hoy tengo casi cuarenta, y nunca volví a comer animales, y soy 1,90 metros de alto, y peso 93 kilos. La mayor felicidad del mundo es ni procurar dolor a nadie, ni fomentar el maltrato animal desde la cocina. Los animales que se sacrifican para comer, no mueren de una forma digna, pues morir dignamente significa morir de viejo,...no como las gallinas de granja, a las que les ponen luz artificial durante venticuatro horas para que sean más productivas. Al tercer mes ya están viejas, mientras yo mismo tengo gallinas en libertad con más de siete agnos.

daZGCqgUaa	Keep in mind that oceanic salt water will have various microorganisms and/or algae that the controlled salt water in fish tanks may not have.  Unless your fish come from the area where you're getting this water from, it could either harm them directly, or by destabilizing the ecosystem that you're making.  Considering the cost involved with the fish and flushing out/sterilizing a tank, it's best to do things "by the book."|`|eacOjLQeaa	No|`|RAdFx6vJaa	no that might kill or hurt your fish, when the pet store say it's salf water? it is not actually SALT water it's a mixeture of salf not just palin old salf|`|60041585a09b26e28706e9097d4156a9aa	i wouldn't<br>  it might hurt your fish w/ all the bacteria and pollution and what not|`|786801669c7d0414855e507dfe380878aa	not a good idea, bacteria, worms and other parasites will eventually win out, ther is a old school im gonna guess 50's/60's method were you keep jars in a drk room for 2 weeks ad then use it. but i wouldnt, i have heard awful things about the catalina real ocean water.  i would jsut buy the salt mix, alot cheaper than a $60 fish and not as difficult as "sanatizing" real saltwater|`|AA11901352	you certainly can.  How do you think they had saltwater tanks years ago (before artificial salt?)   I do it all the time when I winter in florida on the coast.  I walk down to the inlet and bring back 5 gallon buckets to the house and fill the tank.  (Sand too)  when I fish I catch odd ball things and I put them in the tank as well.  When I am ready to come back north I take the fish back to the water and set them free.<br>  <br>  People who live near the water often do this even for water changes.  Any microorganisms would be a benefit to your tank not a harm.<br>  <br>  I will also bring back water from the ocean to "recharge" my tank at home.  this is the best boost your salt tank can get.|`|AA10390481	No, you would more than likely kill your fish.|`|UpudgbZhaa	i dont think you can|`|Y0GF5nQzaa	It wouldn't be smart the ocean would be full of bactera you can get a water filter and filter ocean water then put it in a salt water fish tank though.|`|f9fFXq9eaa	It's probably not a good idea. The salt water in the ocean might have bacteria and whatnot, and it might kill your fish. If you decide to, don't do it on the shore. Most of the time, shore water is 100% polluted, which indeed will harm your fish. I'd recommend asking someone in the fish department at your closest pet store. Or the vet.
DQnGZXjDaa	absolutely not! safe treats for chins are: cheerios, mini plain shredded wheat, a raisin, a piece of dried papaya, apple, or banana. and no vegetables! treats should be given no more than 1-2 per day. chins have very sensitive digestive systems and should stick to their primary diet of chinchilla pellets, timothy hay, and fresh water - nothing else.|`|HgtEHg9faa	Chinchillas generally are pretty delicate (I know that because my best friend's family breeds them). I guess you could try it with one, but if he/she reacts badly to one, don't feed it to your chinchilla again.|`|m1r4dms4aa	I used to feed my chinchilla cheese nips|`|MhUQ1CURaa	nooo no no. i have three chinchilla's, so i guess you could say i know a lot about them.  if you feed your beautiful chinchilla cat treats it will ruin its digestive system! the one great food to feed chinchilla's is spinach. it flows nicely through their digestive track, and it doesn't make their bowel movements smell as vile! trust me, feed your wonderful chinchilla spinach! it does the job.

iBLDy8dmaa	Wer Hunde kastrieren m?chte, sollte sich keine anschaffen. Denn es ist eine Verstümmelung des Tieres ohne Sinn und Verstand!! Grunds?tzlich ist es so, da? ein Dobermann KEIN Anf?ngerhund ist. Die Fragestellung erweckt in mir den Eindruck, als wenn auf der einen Seite ein ganz normaler Dobermann-Junghund steht und auf der anderen ein ganz normaler, überforderter Mensch, der keine Ahnung von dieser Rasse hat. Es gibt Rassen, da kann es trotzdem ein harmonisches HappyEnd geben. Bei dieser Rasse sind die Aussichten weniger günstig, wenn nicht sehr schnell und sehr intensiv fachliche Hilfestellung durch einen Hundetrainer gesucht wird. In Kürze erreicht der Hund seine Pubert?tsphase, dann werden die Probleme dramatisch zunehmen.|`|6336b9c408931b5cd90c754980633db8aa	Ein Dobermann, der in dem zarten Alter schon ein "schwieriger Fall" ist, sollte umgehend kastriert werden - bevor er unbeherrschbar wird!|`|728c0ea6770ac1e95d2ba8c94a84984eaa	kastration ist hier nun wirklich keine l?sung. <br>  was du brauchst ist zeit! ein Hund dieser gr??e hat sich etwa mit 2 bis zwieienhalb jahre erst selbst gefunden. jetzt ist er in der pubert?t... was das beim menschen anrichtet weist du ja...<br>  <br>  also such dir eine guten Hundeverein, mach die begleithundeprüfung und hab vor allem geduld. Der hund muss anerkennen, merken das du der boss bist, das du das sagen hast. ohen hilfe wirstr du das kaum hinkriegen.<br>  <br>  Gru? aus der Eifel<br>  Steffen|`|18f79fd6f8483c4a5b0eeeb771de8482aa	Wenn du mit dem Hund keine Zucht aufmachen willst, würde ich ihn kastrieren. Mein Hund war ?hnlich dominant.  Es hat natürlich auch etwas mit der Erziehung zu tun. Ich habe meinen Rüden kastrieren lassen und er ist etwas ruhiger geworden. Das Wesen des Hundes ?ndert sich nicht sehr. Erziehen musst du ihn trotzdem.<br>  <br>  Anne|`|1e208d7415af0dc237ba1db3d1ea4ccdaa	Es ist ja erstaunlich was man so einem Tier alles so angedeihen lassen will.<br>  Ich hatte zwar keinen Dobermann, leider nur einen Rottweiler A-Rüden und eine griffige Amerikanischer Staffordshire-Terrier-Hündin. Beide habe ich als Jungtiere aus einer anderen Hand übernommen, weil die auch das selbige Problem hatten.<br>  Es liegt erstens am Charakter und dem starken Willen des Tieres, das du für dich und nicht gegen dich zu nutzen erlernen mu?t. Hunde leben meistens in Rudeln, weil sie sich dort geborgen und sicherer fühlen und dieses Gefühl gilt es zu vermitteln. Du mu?t St?rke zeigen, an die sich dein Hund orientieren kann. Hast du diese Führungsst?rke nicht bei diesem Hund, kannst du schon die beste Hundeversicherung abschlie?en die es gibt. Eine Kastration führt eigentlich zu nichts Gutem und es ist der Sinn darin überhaupt nicht zu erkennen.<br>  Wer ist derjenige in der Familie, der energisch und konsequent ist?<br>  Gibt es diesen, dann sollte die Erziehung von demjenigen übernommen werden und bitte zuerst dominant nur eine Person w?hrend der Ausbildungsphase.<br>  Wegsperren ist falsch, denn die Situation muss konfrontiert werden und nicht durch wegsperren das Tier aus dem Rudel ausklammern. Sollte etwas vom Tisch genommen werden und ein scharfes "Nein" reicht nicht aus, dann einen leichten Stüber auf die Nase mit dem Kommando nein geben und das jedes mal, wenn er den Versuch macht. Er wird es bestimmt lassen, wenn es konsequent durchgeführt wird. Nicht brüllen oder schreien, sondern bestimmend und scharf nein sagen. Immer loben wenn etwas geklappt hat - aber nicht überschwenglich dabei werden, weil sonst das Toben dabei in den Vordergrund geraten k?nnte.<br>  Das Ziehen an einer Leine und st?ndiges Bellen kann den Hundeführer zur Verzweiflung bringen und zu dem ist es anstrengend.<br>  Der Hund muss erst einmal eine Unterordnung erlernen und das bedeutet auf der linken Seite mit seiner Schulter im Kniebereich des Hundeführers gehen zu müssen.<br>  Ich habe beim Rottweiler immer ein paar Leckerlies in der Tasche gehabt und so seine Aufmerksamkeit auf mich gelenkt. Immer den Hund auf diese Knieh?he mit dem Kommando "Fu? oder bei Fu?" zurückbeordern und ist er zu weit nach vorn gegangen, ihn rechts um sich auf die linke Seite wenden lassen und dann neben sich Sitz mit dem Kommando "Sitz" machen lassen. Erst wenn er sitzt kommen weitere Forderungen an ihn und nichts dazwischen.<br>  Loben wenn gut und weiter fordern wenn noch nicht seine Aufgabe erfüllt wurde.<br>  Sitz er, dann mit dem Kommando "Fu? oder bei Fu?" den weiteren Weg wieder aufnehmen und wieder darauf achten, dass er in Knieh?he neben einem l?uft. Das Bellen wird ihm bei diesen Anforderungen schon vergehen, denn es muss lernen sich auf seinen Kommandogeber zu konzentrieren.<br>  Wurde eine übung wirklich gut gemacht, dann einen Leckerlie geben, aber auch nur dann.<br>  Weitere Erziehungsma?nahmen sind aus speziellen Fachbüchern zu entnehmen und sollte auch durchgeführt werden, zumindest so weit und so viel, dass der Hund kontrolliert wird und man sich dessen fast sehr sicher sein kann. Denn es muss jedem Hundebesitzer klar sein, dass ein Hund wie eine Waffe sein kann.<br>  Immer die gleichen Kommandos geben, das eigene Verhaltensmuster beibehalten und bestimmend und konsequent bis zur Erfüllung durchsetzen.<br>  Keine Schl?ge, keine Strafen, kein Anschreien, sondern mit Geduld so lange wiederholen, bis er es verstanden hat. Immer mit dem jeweiligen Kommando seine Reaktionszeiten verkürzen sollte die Zielsetzung sein.<br>  Auch nicht mit der Stimme s?useln, sondern normal aber eben bestimmend die Ansprache an das Tier zielgerichtet einsetzen.<br>  Und immer loben wenn etwas gut gemacht wurde - sehr wichtig.<br>  Der Ruck an der Leine ist nicht schlimm, aber es sollte nur ein kurzer Ruck mit dem Kommando "Fu?" zur Korrektur der Position für die Knieh?he sein. Auch immer wieder einsetzen, wenn er seine Position nach vorn verl??t.<br>  Bei der übung "Sitz" die rechte und linke Hand ruhig mit einsetzen. Die linke Hand drückt auf den hinteren Rückenteil und die rechte Hand wird stoppend vor den Hals gehalten oder gegen die Brust gelegt.<br>  Es ist schon wieder fast ein Roman, aber solltest du weitere Fragen haben, kannst du mich über den Messenger erreichen.<br>  Es ist eben sehr wichtig viel Geduld aufzubringen und die notwenige Konsequenz beizubehalten. Euer Hund braucht, so wie ich ihn mir vorstelle, mindestens 4 Stunden am Tag Arbeit und Auslauf. Anders werdet ihr euer Ziel nicht erreichen. Er muss anschlie?end jeden in der Familie, als Rangniedrigster, akzeptieren.<br>  <br>  Anmerkung an einige Schreiber:<br>  Was nützt der Hundetrainer, wenn es die Familie nicht erlernt mit dem Hund umzugehen und das Tier nicht seine Position im Rudel Familie findet. Viele K?che verderben den Brei und ich habe oft erleben müssen, dass das meistens in die Hose gegangen ist. Wer ein Tier haben will, muss auch Opfer erbringen k?nnen.|`|48eecc1547ed409534e55333eb4e0555aa	Was du da aufgez?hlt hast zeigt eigentlich nur das der Hund schlecht erzogen ist ,da wird eine Kastration auch nicht helfen .Versuche es lieber erst mal mit einer Hundeschule ,das der Hund lernt was er darf und was nicht .|`|cb6d0b5697ceb3f78de737982a9962f6aa	Wenn Du bis jetzt nicht in der Lage oder willens warst,Deinen Hund richtig zu erziehen,dann wird es jetzt allerh?chste Zeit.Sonst hast Du mindestens für die n?chsten 15 Jahre Probleme noch und "n?cher".<br>  Geh mit ihm in eine Hundeschule oder arbeite mit einem Trainer.Aber mach nicht den Fehler,zu Hause dann alles wieder schleifen zu lassen.<br>  Ein Kastration ist,wie schon gesagt,kein Ersatz für eine artgerechte Erziehung.Ich befürworte Kastrationen aus dem Grund,um die Hundepopulation nicht ausufern zu lassen.Die Tierheime sind übervoll,jeden Sommer werden neue Hunde aus Urlaubsl?ndern von fehlgeleiteten Romantikern hierher gebracht,und die Zeitungen sind ebenfalls voll mit Annoncen.<br>  Also,sei vernünftig und konsequent.Dein Hund wirds Dir danken und Du wirst Freude an ihm haben.|`|203ecb46f62220e0abb278bebbbf2daaaa	Schwieriege sache....aber ich versuch dir zu helfen:<br>  Die Kastration w?r gut führ deinen Hund, da er sicher irgentwann mal Abhauen wird! Jedoch muss ich dich ent?uschen: Durch die Kastration kann sich einieges ver?ndern!Die Rüden werden ein wenig ruhiger. Aber ihre gehorsamkeit ver?ndert sich nicht! Bei unserem einem Hund sind (Wegen der Kastration) ein paar haare rausgefallen und die Stellen waren manchmal Blutig! Ich habe von einer armen Hündin geh?rt, die Kastriert wurde, danach aber gestorben war, weil der Darm (oder irgent ein anderes Organ) danach verutscht war... <br>  Es kann negative Nebenwirckungen geben!!!(muss es aber net) Aber für Hunde die oft abhauen w?r das sinvoll, sie kastrieren zu lassen!!!<br>  Aber Beratung kriegst du beim Tier-Arzt!!!Also  kannst du ruhig zum Tierartzt gehen!!!<br>  <br>  Ich hoffe ich hab dir nen bisschen geholfen!!!|`|2c6d9d2712caf3f37f88fee685620389aa	suche dir eine Handelsschule für Dobermann weil der Hund nicht ganz einfach ist Kastration so früh kann auch anders herum schlagen und er wirrt aggressiv|`|456bff08538dbac1e3c2dab7d530afc0aa	Geh in die Hundeschule oder suche einen Trainer auf.

Mein Rottweiler ist jetzt 5 Jahre alt und ich habe mich mit ihm mindestens 3 davon rumgequ?lt. Auch ich hatte vorher Rottweiler und auch Ahnung davon wie man sie erzieht. Es war bei keinem so schwer wie bei diesem. Jedesmal wenn eine Hündin in der Nachbarschaft l?ufig war, wurde er total dominant, hat sich benommen als ob ich sein Weibchen w?re und hat st?ndig meinen Mann angeknurrt. Egal was wir gemacht haben, er hat sich nicht ge?ndert. Das ging dann immer so 3-4 Wochen dann beruhigte er sich wieder, aber sobald wieder eine Hündin l?ufig war, fing es wieder von vorne an. Ich konnte ihn nicht mal mehr streicheln, denn das sah er als Anmache an und er bedr?ngte mich dann jedesmal total. <br>  Als nun eine Frau mit einer Hündin in unser Haus einzog und diese dann l?ufig wurde, wurde es ganz schlimm. Wir haben ihn vor 4 Wochen kastrieren lassen und ich mu? sagen, h?tte ich gewusst wie positiv sich das auswirken wird, h?tte ich es schon vor Jahren machen lassen. Er ist sehr sanft geworden, vorher war er ein richtiger Bulli, spielt aber noch genauso gerne und ist nicht tr?ge.|`|98cbabfe27423bbb32604382c4c71f1eaa	Hallo Sandra!<br>  Es scheint wirklich ein Gehorsams-Problem zu sein, das du da hast! Dein Hund nimmt dich nicht für voll und respektiert dich nicht. Da wird dir eine Kastration nicht viel nutzen!!<br>  <br>  Es gibt aber eine M?glichkeit, es auszuprobieren:<br>  Neben der operativen gibt es auch die chemische Kastration. Dabei bekommt dein Rüde einige Injektionen, die denselben Effekt haben, wie eine Kasrtation. <br>  Du k?nntest also mit deinem TA sprechen und die chemische Kastration ausprobieren. Ver?ndert sich das verhalten, wei?t du, das eine kastration sinnvoll w?re, ver?ndert sich ( was ich befürchte) nichts, hast du deinem Hund eine OP und deinem Geldbeutel eine teure Ausgabe erspart!<br>  <br>  Aber ich denke, das du dir die sparen kannst!

Evtl. kann ein dominantes Verhalten abgemildert werden, allerdings ist das ja mehr Charaktersache des Hundes - selten hormonbedingt.<br>  <br>  Allerdings ist dein Hund wohl gerade in der Teenagerphase - l?uft sehr ?hnlich zum Menschen ab ; als Eltern gilt durchhalten und konsequent bei den trainierten Sachen bleiben.<br>  <br>  Die von dir beschriebenen Sachen haben aber eigentlich nichts mit Dominanz zu tun, sondern sind Trainingssache.<br>  <br>  Da die meisten Doberm?nner sehr sensibel reagieren (harte Schale - sehr weicher Kern), solltest du dich ggf. an einen Trainer wenden, der hierauf auch Rücksicht nimmt.<br>  <br>  Drücke Daumen und wünsche dir weiter gute Nerven.|`|cANbmm5Eaa	Man muss einen jungen Hund nicht sofort kastrieren lassen nur weil er mal nicht h?rt, probiere es doch mal mit Erziehung, zeig im wer der Chef ist , er ist noch jung und probiert jetzt aus wie weit er bei dir gehen kann, l?sst du das zu stehst du in seiner Rangordnung unter ihm und das wird dann sehr wahrscheinlich auch so bleiben, und dann k?nnte es sogar vorkommen das er dich wenn er ?lter ist versucht an zu greifen.Wenn du es allein nicht schaffen solltest ihn zu Erziehen hol dir Hilfe von Hundetrainern.|`|cUGaIBgtaa	Dass dein Hund erzogen werden muss haben ja schon alle gesagt.

Ein Dobermannrüde mit 8 Monaten ist voll in der Pubert?t. In diesem Alter ist der Hund noch l?ngst nicht erwachsen, er ist vielleicht frech und respektlos, aber nicht dominant. Du fragst ob es einfacher w?re ihn zu erziehen? Was habt Ihr mit dem Hund gemacht, seit Ihr ihn  habt? Erziehung ist ein langer stetiger Prozess. Wenn der Hund ins Haus kommt, beginnt die Erziehung. Ihr braucht sofort, dringend die Hilfe einer Hundeschule oder eines erfahrenen einfüllsamen Trainers, der Euch zeigt, wie Ihr mit Eurem Junghund umgehen solltet. Alles was Du schreibst, ist einfach das Resultat mangelnder Erziehung und Bindung. Sicher macht die Kastration, durch den Wegfall der Hormone, den Hund vielleicht etwas gelassener. Aber Eure beschriebenen Probleme werden bleiben und sich verschlimmern! Bitte lasst Euch schnell vor Ort helfen, damit Ihr gemeinsam ein zufriedenes Rudel werden k?nnt. Alles Gute!<br>  LG Susanne|`|taXPM8qJaa	Hallo!<br>  <br>  Also erstmal muss ich leider den anderen Antwortern zustimmen in der Hinsicht, da? Dein Hund wirklich ein Erziehungsproblem zu haben scheint.<br>  Ich habe selber einen Dobermann-Rottweiler-Mix Rüden und habe ihn auch kastrieren lassen, weil er extrem dominant gegenüber anderen Rüden war und ich ihn kaum mit anderen Hunden zusammenlassen konnte. In der Hinsicht hat das Kastrieren auch wirklich was gebracht, er versteht sich jetzt mit den meisten anderen Rüden sehr gut.<br>  Es kann auch sein, da? er durch das Kastrieren etwas ruhiger wird vom Wesen her, soda? er sich vielleicht etwas leichter erziehen l?sst. Man kann sowas aber nie vorher sagen, da jeder Hund anders auf das Kastrieren reagiert, bei manchen ?ndert sich auch gar nix.<br>  Deshalb halte ich den vorschlag mit der chemischen Kastration zum Test für sehr gut und sinnvoll.<br>  <br>  Wie auch immer, ich wünsche Dir auf jeden Fall viel Glück!!<br>  <br>  ach ja...@Petra : Wie kommst du denn zu der Annahme, da? man Rüden nur mit med. Begründung kastrieren lassen kann in Deutschland ??? Das ist absoluter Quatsch

dcbd166625f256c1a65ba93124107338aa	DO NOT put a pad in his crate. This will cause him discomfort. I highly discourage the puppy pads all together. This teaches them its ok to go potty in the house. <br>  <br>  Get a crate and leave him only enough room to lay down and sleep. He will not pee in his den. <br>  <br>  Take him out 10-15 min after eating / drinking (every time) then every hour (maybe even half hour) on top of that. <br>  <br>  If you can afford to hire someone to take him out every few hours then definately go for it. I wish I could do that for my dog  :).<br>  <br>  If you see your pup start to sniff around or pace then take him out.<br>  <br>  My puppy is 11wks old and he is completely trained. He now knows to go sit by the back door when he has to go. <br>  <br>  I also go outside with him and watch him do his business. I reward him with a ton of praise and treats (sometimes...dont want him to expect a treat everytime). <br>  <br>  Good luck!!! It can be a nightmare but out of no where one day it will all click and it will suprise you.<br>  <br>  Not only did he have to learn my ways but I had to learn his. It took me a few days to catch onto him running to the back door. So pay lots of attention. <br>  <br>  Also..when you cant be near him (even if you are just watching tv) crate him.|`|14Z1vZjLaa	NO!  The point of the crate is to provide a den like environment where it can stay in for up to 5 hrs at age of 6 months.  Potty pads encourage pottying so that would confuse you puppy!  Also, dogs do NOT like going in their sleeping area which make crates ideal for house training, if you put potty pads in it's crate, it will learn to go in it's crate which = NO!  best of luck with your new puppy!|`|5842cbd9b92850ff74c45212f92fcc8faa	If you do put a piddle pad in the crate make sure the crate is about 1 or 2 sizes too big for the dog so that it can still sleep comfortably. I do not recommend this though. I do not believe in the potty pads. I think it teaches the dog that it's ok to go in the house and what if I forget a piddle pad or I run out? The dog's going to pee on the carpet etc. Depending on the age of the dog, if it is a puppy you will need to hire someone to go let him out, if it's an adult (1+ years) then the dog will be fine while you are at work.|`|UU3gakrnaa	I used to use a neighborhood girl for dogwalking, but with school about to be in, the next best option would be to ask your vet.  I know that's probably not exactly what you were looking for, but vets often know the best service providers for your pet(s).(ie groomers, walkers, etc.) Good luck!|`|tou1MIZUaa	The whole point of crate training is to encourage the dog NOT to potty in it's space.  Most dogs feel VERY uncomfortable "going" in a crate.  It's like us wetting the bed, yuck!  Make sure your puppy is old enough to wait that long to have to potty, and/or hire a puppy-sitter or neighbor to take it out every 2-4 hours while you are away.  as it matures, it will be able to hold it for longer.

AA11992723	Wow. At the park, there's this man who walks two 11 month old great danes at the same time, and seriously I dont know how he does it. So you have my  well admiration too lol.<br>  <br>  It does sound like classic seperation anxiety to me, not that he'll be in an apartment (he should have a big enough bed to stretch out those long legs) The key to that is ignoring the dog when you go in and come home, not making a big deal or showing excitement at all even though its hard when you come home not to, but that will only reinforce the behavior. Use desensitization, like practice going out the door then walking right back in, getting your car keys, etc.<br>  <br>  And look through this forum <a href="http://www.dogster.com/breeds/great_dane" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogster.com/breeds/great_dane</a><br>  <br>  ask those great dane owners for tips!|`|BPMCKbyRaa	Uhhh, most great danes do NOT have separation anxiety.  I know many people with these dogs (along with my own) and only one of them has this issue.  Crate training is not cruel if you don't use it as a punishment.  As long as the crate is the right size, in a nice spot, and comfy, the dog should see it as their "den".  <br>  <br>  My 5 mos dane pup goes in his crate all the time with the door wide open to lay on his bed.   When I go to work, he's locked in so he doesn't damage anything, or get into anything which could hurt him.   He especially likes his crate when I drape a sheet over the top and sides.  It's like his little pup tent (get it?), and he feels secure there.   Never use a crate as punishment, or he could come to view it as a bad thing.|`|2e6b63593deee4333c524ac68cf22a52aa	Doggy Day Camp!  Many kennels, vets, and other animal stores (Petsmart for one) offer interactive play with other dogs.  I work for a similar place and it's common to see Great Danes in the group. If your dog enjoys being with other dogs, it might be a good choice for her.  Find one in your area, they usually operate normal business hours, so you can drop her off and pick her up as needed.  She will probably need an "interview" and I believe most require the pet be spayed or neutered, but many dogs enjoy it, and you don't have to worry about her being in a crate all day.|`|A6vqw4cxaa	How old is she? Has she been crated before? My 9 yr dane was crated as a puppy, but he isn't now. Danes are usually mild manner, in fact we just got a puppy and he is great with him!  (yes the puppy is crated and actually on weekends, goes in there on his own to nap during the day!)|`|Wq3oE1B0aa	Great Danes are EXCELLENT apartment dogs.  The reason many people don't get them is because they have the misconception that Danes need acres of land to run on.  This is actually bad for Dane health.  The best bet is regular excersise at an off leash dog park, that way your dog can decide for his or herself when s/he's finished exercising.  Otherwise you'll have lots of bone and joint problems to deal with when they're older.  Crates are great for Danes.  My dog has been crate trained since he was born and chooses to chill in his crate even with the door wide open after I get home.  You're doing your dog a favor by crate training it because you dont just protect your belongings, you're protecting your dog.  She could have been severely injured on that snake tank.  Start feeding your dog in her crate and no where else.  Give her treats only in her crate, throw toys in there for her to play with, soon she'll see it as her den and you won't have any guilt, because she'll love it there and don't worry about moving your Dane to an apartment.  Some of the oldest living Danes I know were apartment raised.|`|YFK6GSGdaa	i don't think it is such a good idea moving a great dane into a apartment maby you should send her to doggy day care i saw it on TV and there were a lot of people in your situation.|`|nh47yP0Gaa	leaving a great dane in a room or small apartment is cruel!!  maybe you need to be trained....|`|qr9yvBrbaa	I have a 5month old Great Dane, and we still can't leave her alone by herself without being caged... We were gone for 10minutes one day, and left her out since she's fully housebroke, we didn't think it'd be a problem, well we were so wrong! We came home to her chewing up our expensive white couch!! She now is put in her cage when we leave. I'm not sure on how to train her to be good, most Great Danes have separation anxiety. We've found that if we leave our other two dogs out with her, she doesn't chew on the furniture, but we normally do not let her have the roam of the house if we are going to be gone more than an hour.
aEWfO06zaa	Hola Ximena, mi novio es medico veterinario y se algunas cosas por que lo acompa?o constantemente a sus consultas, no puedo explicarte con términos médicos por que yo soy contadora publica, jejeje (otra profesión muy distinta) pero te explicaré con mis palabras.<br>  Se le llama calostro a los primeros líquidos que salen de la ubre de la madre antes de empezar a bajar la leche materna, que no precisamente es leche, sino más bien como un líquido transparentoso blanquecino, entonces en relación a tu pregunta, si el potro esta mamando de la madre, esto significa que esta tomando los calostros, pero si no mama de la madre pues de ninguna manera los esta tomando por que el calostro no existe en formula química, no se puede sustituir como en el caso de la leche.<br>  De tal forma que no necesitas de hacerle ninguna prueba puesto que es muy sencillo determinar si los esta tomando o no, como puedes darte cuenta.<br>  Además los calostros son muy buenos para el potro, de hecho es mejor que la leche.<br>  Espero haberte podido ayudar en algo, suerte.|`|OkFwXrrOaa	Hola!<br>  Por supuesto, antes que nada tenès que consultar con un mèdico veterinario, mejor si se dedica los caballos.<br>  Si no hay especialistas, es preferible uno que trate grades animales.<br>  <br>  Los potrillos no sobreviven si no bebieron calostro, pues no tienen al nacer suficientes anticuerpos propios, y los incorporan a travès de èl.<br>  <br>  Las madres siempre tienen calostro antes de la "bajada de la leche", por lo que no tenès que preocuparte si la madre està viva y el potrillito puede mamar.<br>  <br>  Si la madre muriò en el parto y no pudo sacàrsele calostro aunque mas no sea para las primeras tomas, tenès que conseguirlo de otra yegua que tenga el mismo grupo sanguìneo.<br>  En los haras grandes se suele tener frascos de calostro en reserva para estas emergencias.<br>  <br>  Desconozco si hay en el mercado calostros estandarizado para su venta, me gustarìa tener ese dato. <br>  <br>  Saludos y mucho èxito!|`|1vlwxJi1aa	asi como la los humanos asi es para los animales mamiferos, tomar el calostro, esto es una agua lechosa, que sale antes de empezar a producir la leche materna, y este calostro sirve para proteger la flora intestinal , y a su vez ayuda a prevenir muchas enfermedades, es muy importante beber este calostro, y es muy facil determinar si lo bebio o no, como??<br>   pues si el potrillo se esta amamantando, seguro bebio este calostro del cual de estoy hablando. saludos,|`|Vs1kTxabaa	pues el calostro es muy importante, para la sobrevivencia del potro ya que en el ; van muchos anticuerpos que la madre le pasa, y si no estas seguro si bevio calostro, puedes, darle u suplemento de calostro que venden ala farmacia veterinaria,, en cuanto al test puedes hacerle una prueba sanguinea, y mandarlo algun laboratorio de inmunologia, bacteriologia o patologia,, ellos sabran como hacer esa prueba,,<br>  suerte,, espero te sirva de algo|`|h1mkj30Naa	El test imunologico post natal.

0hTvKlD5aa	Congratulations! What kind is he?  The leash idea is a good one. I would take him on a short walk before bringing him into the house, to let him cool off a bit. This will be a big change for him, so he will be a little stressed and very excited! If it's possible, try to introduce the cat on nuetral territory, like both of them leashed and in the yard, for example. Until they're fast friends, keeping them seperate when you can't supervise is also a good idea.      Good luck!|`|IFiwmb3Haa	As far as the cage is concerned, there are some that you can adjust the space in which the dog can roam, so as it grows you can increase it's size.  Pretty cool.  Costco and Target have pretty cheap dog beds if you're really concerned with getting him a bed that he might out grow.     Don't over load him when he comes home.  Just act normal like the dog has always been there and give him a chance to check out the house on his own.  Only follow him if he leaves the room to make sure that he doesn't get in trouble but if he's within eye sight just let him explore.  You'll be sending the message that you trust him in your home.    It's so awesome that you're getting a dog!  Congrats on rescuing!|`|RhI0ndT2aa	Bless you.  You are really looking forward to this aren't you.  Well, here goes.  Crates are expensive, and not needed in my opinion, unless the dog is to be left for long periods of time, and even then, why?  I have always rescued dogs, and it's only when you get them home, do you really know what you got.  Why not buy a bed, a soft one, but the biggest available for the space your dog will be in.  Your dog will need a space of it's own, (like a crate) where it can withdraw and be left alone.  Decide where it's sleeping place will be, without people, out of the road of the main household, and buy a soft bed. Once your doggy begins to settle, 2 -  3 days, think of buyiing a toy two, but your dog  will give you clues as to what it likes.  Just keep it really calm to start with, and your off to a happy relationship.  Enjoy and keeping asking on here for more help and ideas. Some great dog lovers on here and you will never go far wrong.|`|fFzzU37jaa	I had to do this for introducing my American Bull Dog to my tiny little cat lol ! I think you should definitely put the cat in a safe place and let the new dog sniff the room and get a "smell" for the cat. Then allow the cat to do the same and put the dog in another room. Then the next day or so, separate the two of them but in a way that they are in the same area and can see each other. (i used a baby gate to separate the two and they slowly got closer to each other). Also you could put the dog on the leash and hold the cat ( i never tried that before but its an idea). Talk to the animals and encourage them to "be nice".. It might take a while so dont get discouraged.. and btw, when you're not home, make sure they are separated and cant get to each other until you are sure they are cool.. Hope this helps =]|`|6wSmZrrsaa	You need to be very very patient when adopting a dog. it most certainly won't go as you planned it. You should let the cat be exposed to his smell a few times before introducing them.|`|enC9TvxUaa	- You are getting to a wonderful start.  Using the same food- GREAT!

8jhtjNGoaa	I agree - ball pythons or corn snakes. As far as ball pythons not biting - one of ours bit me, but all it feels like is a static shock. They do get used to human contact very quickly an aren't usually aggressive (excpet for females with eggs). Just make sure it's a captive born or captive bred snake. There is a huge market for catching baby snakes in the wild and selling them. Captive born is a little better - it means that they got the eggs and they were born in captivity - but are technically first generation wild animals. Captive bred snakes are ones that have been properly bred from tame and domestic animals. They are safest and usually much more docile. You should really make sure of that for any kind of reptile.|`|e9RpVQtuaa	Corn snake!!!!! Don't get a ball because they can be problem feeders which isn't good for a first snake. My first snake was a corn and he is the most tame snake i've ever had. Corns are easy to provide for and are generally good feeders. =]|`|PIwP8DFxaa	Ball python because they are easy to care for and don't bite|`|ZSWmOkE6aa	Corn snakes make amazing pets for a first time snake owner. I have a corn snake and she is my first snake so I know a lot about them.    HOUSING  If you decide to get a corn snake you want to get a baby. You can either get a bin to house him/her in or a glass terrarium. When I got my snake I bought a 20 gallon tank for her. This size is good for the whole snakes life. When it is an adult you might want to get a 30 gallon so the snake can have a little more room. In the tank you will need to get a water dish that is big enough for your snake to submerge itself completely in, two hides(one for the warm side and one for the cool side),two thermometers and a humidity gauge, substrate (i like to use Kaytee aspen bedding. I got a huge bag for only 12 dollars) and for heating I like to use a ceramic heater. Instead of having two hides I have a nice big plant on the cool side that my snake can hide in. Also if you want the tank to look nicer you can a couple of fake plants and for the snakes enjoyment, a fake vine to climb on. This is all you need for the tank.  HEATING  Like I said before I like to use a ceramic heater for my tank. It works really good for me. There are a couple of different options for heating your snakes enclosure: you can use heat tape or a heat pad which just sticks to the bottom of the tank. You can also use infared bulbs that give off heat and you can leave it on all day. Again, you can use a ceramic heater which gives off no light. For all bulbs you will need to get a heat lamp. Make sure to get one that can hold at least 75 watt bulbs. Temperature and humidity levels are very easy to mantain with corn snakes. On the warm side temperatures should be between 75 and 80 degrees and on the cool side 70 to 75 degrees. The humidy level in the tank should be from 30 to 50%. If the humidity is too low the snake could have shedding problems.  FEEDING  Corn snakes are exellent feeders. As babies and juveniles they should be fed once a week and try to feed them on the same day each week. As babies they should be fed one pinkie mouse once a week. I like to feed frozen/thawed mice because they don't have any diseases or any bacteria on them. Your snake will be safer too because a live mouse could hurt your snake. Also you should always watch your snake while it eats.I also use feeding tongs to feed my snake and I would suggest buying a plastic bin for feeding so the snake does'nt associate your hand coming into the cage with feeding.  MATANENCE  Caring for corn snakes is very easy. Once a day you should hold your snake and check the temperature and humidity level in the tank. Every other day change the water and always check to see if there is any poop and just spot clean. Every 2 to 4 weeks you should clean out the cage by replacing the substrate, washing out the whole tank with a terrarium cleaner ( Natural Chemistry healthy habitat works really good),washing all the hides, plants, water dish, and anything else that   you feel needs to be done.

Come in dozens of colors and patterns. And are VERY hardy snakes which can take "mistakes" by the owners. (errors in temps, etc, etc)    Balls are good snakes but the fact that they can be difficult eaters can be hard for a first time owner. Having a ball python go off feed for 4 months can be stressful for a beginner. Plus their humidty and temp requirements, while not difficult, are higher than a corn snake. Some balls pythons never do switch to frozen/thawed prey either which can be fustrating.    Garters snakes are a decent choice, but some will never take rats/mice as food. Which leaves you with fish, toads, leeches, earthworms, etc, etc. Then you have to use supplements as all the above mentioned (other than mice) lack nutrients.    Kingsnakes and Milksnake are probaby a good second choice behind a corn snake.     Bull Snakes are NOT a good choice for a beginner. Anything from the Pituophis family(Bulls,Gophers,Pines) is considered an intermediate level snake. Hardy as all heck, but more often than not your going to get some serious attitude(hissing, striking) from them until they calm down which can be months and some unfortunately never do calm down.|`|R62BrdISaa	Ball Python, very timid, and gets used to the human touch quickly, not aggressive at all|`|yb0ROdR3aa	go to aqualandpetsplus.com they have tons of info on snakes|`|AA11000822	Ball Python.

Plus, if a rat is lively you can be more certain he is healthy because if they are unwell they will sleep a lot. This is a good thing because if they suddenyl start sleeping a lot you will know somethings wrong and be able to sort it out before it is too late.

Rats also prefer to have a friend, so if Buttercup is alone, getting another female rat will make her a happier girl.    It might also be a good idea to get her a wheel- make sure it's big enough and safe for rats. The Wodent Wheel is the best, since it has a solid running track (instead of wire, like many hamster wheels have) and no parts that will trap a rat's tail. You can get them online. The Wobust size is the largest and is best for a rat. Since she's so active, she will probably enjoy running on one.     As for not sleeping, she's probably just sleeping when you are, so you don't notice it. Contrary to popular belief, most rats are not nocturnal.|`|GenpGk7Daa	Yes! Rats love to play. Rats are highly social animals and thus make very deep bond with their cage-mates and owners. You can tell when your rat adores you, they will lick you just like a miniature dog!

Also other good snake links if you need more.|`|AA12315533	Well, one question I would like to ask you is, how long ago did you get it?

Live, frozen?|`|gCBqdHf2aa	Ok, I kind of need more than this. Did you just him/her then it is probably just getting use to its new surroundings. Are you feeding it dead pinkies then you might want use a knife to cut its head open so they can sense it. When I first got mine she didn't eat for a little bit either. It will be okay.|`|rrKRbQcsaa	Once they feed they can stay unfed for a few days to a few weeks depending on how old the snake is and how much you fed it.  I use to have a corn and if I left teh pinkie with it he wouldn't go.  sometimes I would have to intice it bu holding him in my hand and guiding his head towards the food.  Other times I would put the pinkie on top of his heater (that had a plastic covering over the lamp) before I put it in his tank. He took it that way too.
MaUlbbCMaa	How I got rid of fleas and bugs from my home<br>  <br>  You will need to get a simple bug/fly zapper; a friend or neighbor may already have one you can use. You can buy one that will cover a 3000 sq ft area of your house at an OSH or Home Dept type stores for as little as 20.00-30.00 dollars. Place the zapper on the FLOOR in a corner behind an end table so kids and pets won’t bother it. Remember, it is a piece of electrical equipment. You have to use caution in where you put it. Fleas will go to the light especially at night. When they hop in to the bug zapper you can actually hear little, zits, zits when the fleas are getting fried! Keep the carpet vacuumed daily until your flea problem is under control, this will help tremendously in getting the fleas eggs out of your home and carpet faster and break the flea egg cycle!! I am not responsible for misuse of the this item, I am telling you what I did with my zapper and it worked so well I wanted to share my success. Use full caution in placing your bug zapper to the safest place. It will work for months, even years; it will continue to kill bugs in your home as long as the light is on. The bulb can be replaced once it burns out. The light bulb can be purchased the same stores mentioned above.

x8Vgu6acaa	Actually, canned food has less nutrition than dry.  It is mostly water.  <br>  You can use it mixed in the dry to try to coax him to eat more, but as a full diet, I don't recommend it.  Dry is also better for his teeth.  <br>  Are you feeding a good quality dry food?  You can try a dry that has more calories  one for active dogs if what you are using is not keeping his weight up.  <br>  Also,  instead of canned, you can try pouring warm water over his food.  This releases the smell and may encourage him to eat more.  Once he is eating better go back to just feeding dry.|`|lMJBaacxaa	It's not always true.

iJtuhLMTaa	Unfortunately what will happen to Chihuahuas is the same thing that happened to Dalmations with 100 Dalmations and Golden Retrievers with Air Buddy and every other breed in a popular movie.  People will run out and get them from BYB because responsible breeders will screen and realize the breed is not right for someone, they will get tired of the dogs and drop them off buy the dozens in shelters.  In the mean time BYB and puppy mills will produce as many puppies as possible to make a quick buck due to the demand and do damage to the breed over all most likely resulting in temperament issues, health problems etc.  The poor Chi's are probably just starting to recover from the Taco Bell Chihuahua craze and now this.|`|1tOr2qLAaa	I saw the movie and loved it. The second part where the head Chihuahua was talking about how they were not just lap dogs, they didn't want to be dressed in silly clothes and a lot more it was a good message. At the end of the movie there is a written statement about really thinking about having a dog, they are a big responsibility and to please adopt. There probably will be some spike in getting a Chihuahua, however because of the way things are now, money being tight I think maybe there will be less of a race to get one. |`|nN5o4djIaa	Of course!!!  Every time there's a movie put out with a specific breed in it there's a mad rush on that breed... everyone wants one.  Then when they find out that the breed's traits are what they expected (because they were too stupid to not investigate the breed first) they drop them off at shelters or try to resell them.|`|Jn1ZfBxlaa	I think yes to both as well.

B6zl0AJDaa	I would still go with ebay because you can get a better saddle (used) with what you have for money.  High withers and protruding backbone means that you'd probably have to go with a semi Quarter Horse tree (A frames are really rare nowadays) and a channel pad (A saddle pad that has padding on the sides but nothing but material in the center so that it raises the saddle up on the sides so that it doesn't hit the withers or back bone.<br>  <br>  Good brands of saddles are Circle Y, Tex Tan, MacPherson, <br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/14-15-Circle-Y-Show-Saddle-Used_W0QQitemZ230302147179QQcmdZViewItem?hash=item230302147179&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_trkparms=72%3A1205%7C66%3A2%7C65%3A12%7C39%3A1%7C240%3A1318" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/14-15-Circle-Y-Show-...</a><br>  Just a sample...<br>  <br>  The more reasonable brands are Big Horn, Simco to name a couple.|`|GloEYJ2xaa	check your local craigslist listings I found some good stuff there. plus check local tack shops and local auctions for tack|`|z0iTOf88aa	I don't know much about western saddles, but I do know about saddle-hunting.  Try going into local tack shops and talking with a saddle fitter about your horse and your needs (what kind of leather? what is your horse like? what type of riding within the western world do you do? [barrels, poles, etc.]) because they will be able to point you in the right direction and give you the "lo down" on the different saddles.  Also sign a couple out (sometimes you can only do this one-at-a-time, other times you can take multiple ones home) and test-ride them for about a week (you are usually given about a weeks' time).<br>  <br>  Seriously look for something used.  You can get an otherwise incredibly expensive saddle used for a great price (usually) but take your time in finding them because they are out there, but you sometimes really have to look and exercise your patience.|`|EmpgCP6baa	My favorite place to look for used tack is www.tacktrader.com, as it has really good search engines to look for tack. If you want some thing new, check out schneiders tack: www.sstack.com. It has some great show saddles. The only retailer I've heard of that offers test rides is dover, but thats english tack. I'd check classified ads in the newspaper, and at local stables, because if the seller is close to home, you might be able to test it. Especially if your horse is high-withered, this is really important, because most western saddles are designed for horses with non-existient withers. Be sure to check nearby tack shops too. Your budget is very reasonable for some low end show tack, and surely reasonable for work tack. It varies from person to person, but I think Circle Y tack is best. Their tack is super durable and looks great.|`|XDJjPBMyaa	valley vet has some saddles that you try out and if you dont like it you can send it back|`|L6PLycMcaa	get all your tack on chickssaddlery.com they have awsome tack for really cheap prices! and you could look on unclehenrys.com|`|a1acfa439fbad0e3325483edcfd4abd8aa	Try your local craigslist.org like someone suggested and your tack shops or places that sell horses and have tack.  Tackbag.com and TackTrader.com also. The problem with Ebay is item cannot be seen other than photo and if you buy, you are pretty much stuck with it if it doesn't fit your horse.<br>  Used is good and usually it can be returned.  Be sure to ask seller about returns. Price ranges on used can be $100 and up.  Best suggestion is to get a brand name saddle as someone suggested.  BIg Horn is medium priced and good quality. Your budget is high but it depends on what kind of riding and how much you will be doing. Main suggestion is that saddle needs to fit horse properly and comfortable for you.|`|U2bzVhZxaa	Find a local tack shop in your area, and get someone experienced in fitting tack to help you.  You don't want to get tack that's too cheap; it wears quickly and easily, and you don't want your tack to break.  Make sure your tack fits your horse as well.
B6zl0AJDaa	PATIENCE!!!       The ability to rate riders.    I've had bunches of lesson horses in the past nearly 3 decades.  The two that stand out were my 16 yr old Appy gelding, Michael Red Bird who I watched before I got him, say "NO!" to a little 4 year old girl who tried to pull him across her 2 year old brother.  Mikey's known by the now mid 20's young man as one of the two horses that saved his life.    The other, is Buddy, my late hubby's QH who's now 20.  He can rate a rider with uncanny skill.  I've watched him babysit my late hubby, my nieces and nephews and yet screw around with riders who know what they are doing!      I've watched him take timid riders and build up their confidence, then take a confident rider and show them that they don't know it all!|`|gbd4PMwfaa	When I rode lesson horses they were normally bomb proof. They would spook at nothing. Since you already have horses you probably already know this but ponies can be brats. i would puta kid on a horse before a pony. i thik an all around horse would be good. A horse that knows the ropes and will do anything, even if the kid gives the wrong cue.|`|RloOJ43haa	I think there are two stages of lesson horses and the qualities you look for depend on the stage you are looking at.    For a horse to put absolute beginners on, he should be dead quiet and I mean almost catatonic. He should be smart enough to obey the instructor and pretty much ignore his rider. This is the horse you want rank beginners on so that they can learn to sit on a horse.     For advanced beginners, you still want a quiet horse, but not a lazy horse. This horse should do exactly what his rider says, not necessarily what his rider means. Beginners do not always understand how to apply the aids yet, so if the horse does exactly what he is told, they will know that they did it wrong. They can keep trying until they get the result they want, and then they know they did it right. A horse with too much initiative may know what his rider means and do it, but then the rider does not really learn as well. This is the horse that will actually teach someone to ride.     For either case, a horse that is pretty small would be less intimidating to a new rider. They should have the patience of a saint, be sound enough to carry a variety of riders, and smart enough to keep their riders out of real trouble. Older horses are usually better choices as they know their jobs better and are usually quieter.|`|xO1ICZYIaa	they need to be very calm, so yong children would be safe around them. they also should have good ground manners. the height really doesn't matter, unless it's like a 11hh pony or something. age...you don't want something too old, they still need to be able to work. something between 3-15 would be good.  hope this helped :D|`|ewwfcDDyaa	calm, well training, a little older, teens probably, sound, reliable, not bucking or rearing, willing, won't mind little kids pulling there mouths when riding, won't refuse jumps, relaxed on trail, will go into any gait without a fight.|`|6GehblM3aa	- Older.  Older horses that have "been there", are great for beginners because they know that everything is okay and that nothing is going to eat them.    - Very calm.  There is nothing scarier than being on a horse for the first time and it spooking or fidgeting constantly.    - Well trained.  This way, the horse will know what it's doing and not be surprised when it is asked to do something.  It also makes it way easier on the rider who might just be learning something.    - Still has athletic ability.  It is important that the horse can still do the things it was trained to do, even if he is older.|`|Xobbmd7Saa	They need to be patient and understanding. Not too young and probably not HUGE as that is intimidating for beginners. I would get like a pony and a 15-16 hand horse. Not too young either because they need some miles. For advanced horses get some in their teens so your older students can take them to shows at higher levels.|`|mW7mBOAcaa	Lesson horse shouldn't be too young, young horses are usually quite fresh.I reccomend Quarter horses, they can be ridden any style, don't spook easily, and are usually sound.The most important thing with lesson horses is being calm, and there are certin horses in every breed that are "bombproof".|`|j2yLjm6Naa	They should be relaxed and willing to put up with anything ( such as children ) And not easy to spook.   Patient  and a sweet temprament|`|u4F1OiE4aa	I would definitely look for something that is calm and does not get angered/frustrated easily. When kids or adults are learning how to ride, they need something that is safe and bombproof. Also quarter horses or paint horses are very versatile so they could do either english or western. Smaller horses usually make children feel more comfortable, but not always. Good luck finding horses!|`|lI7ceTFDaa	they need to be patient of many kids around them...  very calm in a variety of situations  also, non responsive to leg cues and hand jerking  beginners have tendencies to kick the horse, yank at the reins, sometiems simultaneously    a good age would have to be 12 or 13ish, then the horse is already trained and ready to roll...and its not too old  you might be able to find a younger horse with good training, which is awesome    also, a good height depends  if ur dealing with little kids as beginners, go with a nuetral horse or pony...bigger horses (even though more docile) will scare the kids easier b/c of their size...not to mention the bigger feet to step on teh kids with    hope this helps  good luck finding horses!!
zsaRJP4paa	Full size, a cob is for a small horse like an Arabian. Although I have seen some full size bridles not fit some "regular" sized horses. Make sure to check the fit across the browband and around the ears so it is not pinching and that your cavesson is buckled so that is falls just below the cheek bone (so that the horse doesn't get pinched between the cavesson and the bit. You will need to apply some contact on the mouth when checking to make sure it does not pinch. :~) Good luck to you!|`|gbaw9wHWaa	Yep most thoroughbreds take a full size bridle mine has a huge roman head and is 16hh and he takes a full size.|`|L5X2Bx6Uaa	I also have a TB and i bought him a Full bridle and it was perfect, and you can always ajust the side straps if needed for small ajustments.  Also for a bit (if you're looking for a size) most TB's are 5 1/4 to 5 1/2. I got 5 1/2 and its good. Good Luck!|`|d9tujQiNaa	I would go full I had a TB 15.2 hands took a full size bridle and bit|`|jlLngFERaa	Measure your horse along the cheeks and over the pole as well as across the brow band and around the nose and throat latch area - or measure the bridle you are currently using that fits him.  Once you have an idea of what his measurements are ask the tack store which one is closest to that.  I say this only because I had a TB who had a very refined head and usually had to wear a cob bridle - the odd full size bridle would fit her if I added as many holes as I could.  Bridles can fit differently according to make - but if you measure his head or a bridle you are already using then you will have a better chance of getting one that fits him well.
djmqoFSTaa	Bryce Canyon??  That's desert...<br>  <br>  1.  WATER in a CANTEEN...a large one<br>  2.  Portable water bag to hook on my saddle...5 or 10 gallon size...for my horse.<br>  3.  Grass or alfalfa pellets for my horse<br>  4.  first aid kit...horse/human...with salt tabs, lip balm, sunscreen, matches, guaze, vet wrap, iodine wash, extra hay bale twine, bute, tylenol, ibuprophin, OFF...yada yada....<br>  5.  multi-purpose tool...a big one too.  Can double as hoofpick.<br>  6.  a large caliber weapon...hunting if allowed, protection, horse euthanasia if necessary...that place has slick rocks in places that could be a death sentence for a horse with a broken leg.  Also for signaling if necessary.<br>  <br>  Cell phone won't work...CANYON!!  Gun comes in handy here again...for signaling.<br>  <br>  If this is Peek a Boo trail...there is NO WATER there.  You gotta take it with you.  For you and horse.  No water means...no grass for grazing either...gotta bring feed.<br>  <br>  **edit...I NEED MORE CHOICES!!!  <br>  I need boots...maybe...for my horses if they throw a shoe or get a bruise.  This is rough ground.<br>  I need toilet paper too!!!  Can I put that in my first aid kit??<br>  I'll be wearing my hat and such...guess those won't count...right?<br>  Is a wool blanket for sleeping considered part of the tack?  I would tie it behind my saddle.  If not...I'm gonna make sure I have 2 wool saddle blankets...it gets cold at night in the desert.  I might need to cover with them.<br>  <br>  **edit...I'm agreeing with Calamitty...if this is an outfitted ride, 6 items might be okay...as long as they were supplying food, a campsite with bedding, cooking utensils, a way to contain the horses or to tether them, and a way to water them more...<br>  <br>  If not...6 items is going to be dicey.  You will be hungry, cold, and thirsty.  Your horse may not get cold...but he'll be hungry and thirsty.|`|IJoM4Q50aa	Not enough stuff. I just wouldn't go. Unless of course I was running for my life or something. =)|`|2co8VRwMaa	First off, in my camping trip the horse would be fully tacked, would be wearing a headcollar under the bridle, and have a leadrope (or two) clipped to the D rings. That counts as tack on the horse, not as my items. I would also be wearing rain coat, thermals for night time, etc. Then:<br>  <br>  1. Food and water (for both of us)<br>  2. First aid kit (again, for both of us)<br>  3. Swiss Army knife<br>  4. Sleeping bag<br>  5. Some sort of shelter set up<br>  6.

9Ff4Bms7aa	From experience, I would say to give this fish a little more time--ripped fins can heal with proper care and water paremeters.    Add a bit of Melafix in there, as well as some aquarium salt (The 'fish guy' in town should have some, they are common fish remedies). Make sure that the filter isn't too strong for your fish (is he the same fish I answered in your previous question?) (Put something around the intake tube so that it may be weaker, but is still capable of sucking in dirt and debris)  It's a bit normal for your fish to be less energetic than it was before (if your leg was broken, would you move around?)   Make sure he gets his proper nutrition (is still eating) and your tank is clean, and see if there is any improvements.    I personally never give up on my fish, unless there is really no other way to it. I completely agree with your view of the importance of your goldfish's life--it can't be replaced!    But, to answer your question...  To euthanize a fish, many people choose to put this fish in the freezer and leave it there, so that the fish will die from cold temperatures (most think that fish will not feel anything). Others like to flush them down a toilet (cruel, unless they really ARE dead), and many other methods can be used.    But don't give up yet! Your fish isn't all gone, it can still get better~!|`|SpcYCBndaa	time for fish and fries|`|sMTVcfiVaa	I have never heard of euthanizing a fish, but you might want to call your vet and get his opinion.    EDIT: Man, these other posters are insensitive. You must care a lot about this particular fish to try to find a way to end his suffering. Call your vet for advice.|`|xQtnTKCAaa	put dish soap in the water?|`|jh9iPYvXaa	There are several options:     1) Toilet bowl   2) Pot o' boiling water   3) Slingshot   4) Blender   5) Frying pan with butter and shallots|`|U0KCmsKXaa	Burial at sea.  I did this when my fish was dying of Ich.  It was disgusting watching him suffer so I finally flushed the poor thing.|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	Someone asked this same question a few days ago and the best answer I saw was clove oil.  It acts like a general anesthetic on fish.  You can put the fish in a smaller container to reduce the amount of water, then add it drop by drop until the fish goes to sleep, then stops breathing.|`|qplKpji5aa	Flush him down the toilet.|`|FUutOp46aa	why do you say there is no hope!?   what exactly is wrong with him?|`|TSQxwlbraa	That would be horrible to have to kill him yourself. I would have someone else do it.|`|QVjnAQ9waa	this may seem cruel but you should get a cutting board and knife.  then ask some one you know has no emotional connection with fishy  and in one swift move pull him out of the tank and chop his head off.  totally painless.then have the person put him in a little box.and bury him.  its most humaine.|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	put him in freezer|`|e49de377def7dc80a5baa53274275b3baa	I wouldn't not give up on him yet  try to keep the tank parameters perfect, meaning no ammonia, no nitrites and nitrAtes below 20ppm    make sure the tank is well filtered    i would try to put aquarium salt into the tank, in the ratio of 1 tablespoon per 5 gallons    do regular water changes of 25% every 3-4 days until you see he might get better|`|NoOM7eZnaa	There are two humane ways to euthanize a fish:    1 part clove oil, 2 parts water. The clove oil acts as a harmless anesthetic that puts the fish quickly to sleep and then shuts down his vital organs, causing him a painless, quick death.    The second way is to freeze him. Take him out of the water and fill a baggy with some of the water and a few ice cubes. Slowly and gently lower the fish into the baggy and put it in the freezer for about an hour. Although this will be somewhat uncomfortable way to die, it's apparently one of the most painless ways.|`|m0e3a3gWaa	I answered this question a a few day ago and I got allot of Thumbs down.  I suggested freezing the fish or simply cutting his head off.  Because of all the "Thumbs down" I called a bunch of Veterinarians in my neighborhood along with some local fish stores.    EVERY single one of them said freezing the fish is the most painless and humane way to dispose of a fish.|`|DqOkUgVsaa	i know u might think this is painful but its not so put him in the freezer that way he just dies without feeling a thing!|`|XKKSfo6raa	that james dude is cute        oh ya, put him in the freezer|`|6rOJZxxSaa	dont kill it!!! put it in a quarentine tank and go see if you can get medicine for him... depending on how much you like him and what kind of fish.... a goldfish i would just go buy another for like a dollar and pretend it never happened|`|qbP5uAuJaa	euthanizing him? Sweet heart, he's a fish. You may need to let him go. But I highly suggest just keeping its water super clean, and feeding him high quality pellets or other foods. As you said, he is doing better, and maybe you should only keep his water clean and keep a close eye on him.

Use a squirt bottle|`|AiyRv4Kraa	No.   Clickers and treats are the best. Clickers can be picked up at any Pets Mart.    Invisible fences are electrical but not as strong as tasers. You might kill your dog that way since tasers are meant for humans, not animals.|`|J4v5xNg2aa	totally different, invisible fences use a very low power shock. not a continuous flow of electricity. they are not made to imobilize the dog, just scare them away from the boundary. tasers take control of the nervous system, your muscles cant move because the signals from ur brain are interrupted but the taser.     DO NOT USE A TASER TO TRAIN YOUR DOG. VERY CRUEL.     watch Dog Whisperer, I'm sure you can get some SAFE and NON-HARMFUL ways of training your dog.    just asking this makes me want to say you should NOT own an animal, at all.|`|YJBpCu3iaa	are you stupid? NO! dont ever use it on an animal. that is deffinetly animal abuse.|`|AA10457774	not for the dog, but it is an excellent trainng tool for MORON owners!|`|fVcR6rpzaa	No!!! Hello, why do you think cops use one on criminals...it hurts! It is also very dangerous to use on an animal. Only use it if you will let your dog use it on you as well.|`|IpbC2dUsaa	No, not really. Aside from the fact that it's a pretty cruel device to use on anyone, especially an animal, the fact remains that most (if not all) tasers on the market are designed to be used against humans. Dogs, being smaller than humans in almost any case, would be more potently effected and would have a much higher risk of permanent injury or death.    And, again, it's a jerk move.|`|AA12128656	the only thing you can train a dog to do with a taser is play dead.  permanently.    i certainly hope you don't have a dog...|`|nukcYkR9aa	NO|`|5nfqY9T7aa	The shock of a taser is too strong.  Your dog would just end up afraid of you and traumatized.|`|V7Y9ldTUaa	hahah no invisible fence is not the same as a tazer. close, but no.  I would recomend not using a tazer...|`|AE7W7Jspaa	Only if you teach the dog to use it on you....sheesh|`|hgdixjzRaa	NO! would you taser your kid? i sure hope not! spray him with water or something!    |`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	No it isn't how invisible fences work and not a good idea unless you're using it to defend yourself...from another person!!! Don't be stupid...you could kill your dog!|`|tA8T4QYFaa	No    Invisible fences work through a shock collar that sends a mild shock to the dog - but the dog associates the shock with a location, not with you.|`|OTxCCXa5aa	Don't be an idiot. You can't use a taser to train a dog.|`|afPzgCSHaa	N0!|`|KxjUim7yaa	Using a taser as a training tool would make a neurotic dog. A dog needs to be rewarded for good behavior, not punished. Training a dog with a taser would be excessively cruel.|`|AA10093245	No, that would be cruel and teach the dog to fear you, (if it didn't kill him)  so no, not good.  Electric invisible fences deliver a mild shock if they go past the boundary, but it's not associated with a human delivering the pain.  I don't think either one is humane at all. Better a real fence, and good obedience training, and a kind loving master.|`|hfu63hoxaa	i love animals so.......NOOOOOOOOO!  what you do is give him edible a reward if he is right. but if hes wrong tell NO! BAD!(maybe a few times) and try it again. but over all some dogs just dont learn tricks. NO TASOR!|`|7yIdHlWUaa	Dude, tasers kill people. Don't use it on a dog!|`|seeRRQkraa	NO, IT WILL KILL HIM.    A taser has 50,000 volts running through your body. A dog could not withstand than amount of electricity - you will most definitely KILL the dog. PEOPLE have died from taser use.    P.S. the very fact that you are asking this tells me that YOU are an animal abuser. I hope he attacks you.|`|bLZraSbvaa	You a freak|`|A8k9NHigaa	no you idiot, if you think so you dont need a dog!!|`|VjV7W6qLaa	It souds good to me when it shocks him he gets momentarely paralized. and it could hut him|`|542225d546547d609d968b005377742caa	Invisible fences do use an electrical shock to train the dog, but I believe a taser is too much power and thus too severe for simply training a dog. The idea is to make them feel unpleasant and prevent them from repeating an action such as leaving the yard; a taser will literally send them howling to the ground or possibly inflict serious damage on smaller dogs.    So no, a taser is not a good tool for your job.|`|a1343f058c3dec40fe918611b8bc0ceaaa	teasers use a higher voltage, do no use on your dog|`|QJTOvC98aa	Invisible fences typically work first by beeping or chirping to let the dog know they are getting close to the line. If they do touch the line, the collar will briefly shock them - not with a taser which is totally different.    Its more like putting your tongue on the battery terminals of a big batter. I put my dogs collar on my arm and got zapped before putting it on her. You can adjust the settings, also.|`|AA12004844	no a taser is not a good tool for training dogs    while invisible fences also give a shock, the fences do sound a warning first so that the dog hears it and has the chance to back up from the border.  Also the shocks can be pretty mild - like to just get their attention versus a taser is made to temporarily incapacitate     big difference    go to dog obedience classes - it works and you will both be happier.|`|VgXwkFWraa	No a taser is terrible training for a dog. It doesn't resolve anything. It also depends on what you're going to use the taser for. If you use an electric fence, keep it very low your dog will understand what the boundaries are. But for training its very damaging and causes problems.|`|yoNyPfMraa	don't do it. you will ashamed and regret it one day. it's not cool or funny or even as effective as you might think. don't be a loser and abuse other living things.|`|tLxk3Q5caa	NO, do not use a taser gun on a dog or any animal for that matter. An electric fence works by emitting short wave radio signals to the animals collar which lets out a small dose of electric current which tells the animal to back the heck up. It current is not strong enough to harm the animal. I had it for my dogs.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Lets see....turn it on yourself first. Then if its not painful...go ahead! Seriously..if you are having trouble training your dog I would suggest going to a trainer! Dogs need a firm hand and patience..not to be shocked!|`|rql2ZEJcaa	no its too powerful for a dog!!!!   even shock collars shud only be used under the supervision of a dog trainer or else there could be complications!! theres a lot more to using a shock collar than just pressing a button!!!!|`|muPiBQ3Uaa	Not a good training tool.     But it works great in keeping you from being attacked by a loose dog. I have also used pepper spray and a battery powered cattle prod to prevent attacks on my wife and her Guide Dog. Very effective. Not good for training, but will deter attacks.
enC9TvxUaa	-Need a vet visit, but if you simply cannot just keep a close eye on him.  Can he walk on it?  If he can, that's a good sign!  Could be a sprain or bruise.  Check the leg well to see if you see open wounds, stickers, something in the fur itself.  1/2 of an aspirin also works well for minor aches- they have them just like we do.|`|vRG0ebayaa	Can you not find a free animal hospital because I'm seriously thinking he needs a vet/attention to that leg. You could try somewhere like the PDSA.    Good luck with him.|`|5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -  Okay love first off has your dog fallen or jumped off of anything lately?  Gently lay your dog down and start at the top of the leg with your hand GENTLY around the leg. Touch to see if anything is out and slowly work your way down.  Remember exactly where the flenching area is.  (where he shows pain)  Also look at his paw pads.  Sometimes the slightest things can get stuck in between them as well as in them such as a thorn from outside.  Take a nice gentle look, separate the pads so you can see clearly.  If there is a thorn you can get it carefully with a tweezers and clean it with a cotton ball that has a bit of peroxide on it.  If it is a leg injury most vets will let you bring them in and do some sort of payment plan.  Call ahead and tell them what's up.  Remember the vet is not someone to be afraid of they are after the best interest for your dog and you.  Keep calling until you find a vet who will help...let us know how it works out.  I am glad you have such compassion for your dogs pain...that shows how very much you love him.|`|82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	Sorry but without an x-ray there is no way to tell.

Just be sure they do not treat unless first discussing it with you. Most vets will be willing to just do an exam for about 50 bucks. It's well worth it.|`|bakQFJjdaa	some of my friends dogs have been doing that same thing. it could be arthritis or his leg could be coming out of socket. that's about the only things i can think of. I really think that you should bring him to a vet as soon as possible though, i could be serious.  Look into your Local animal shelters because they sometimes have programs that are allot cheaper than a normal vet. Good Luck|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Having a pet is like having a child. When they need doctoring, they need it! Most vets will work with you. But if you absolutely can't afford a bill, try the SPCA in your area. Some have funds to help owners who can't afford vet care.

Call the vet you normally deal with and explain what you are seeing wrong in your dog.  I'm sure in today's recession, a vet will understand that presently you have found yourself in an unfavorable position you didn't imagine yourself being in that has put a strain on your financial ability and you may not be able to pay the bill all at once.  Maybe there can be some compromise made.  Good luck to you and your dog.|`|H5NGXgqsaa	Have you tried examining the dogs leg/paw yourself? Sometimes a dog can get something in their paws which can cause great discomfort...as well as your dog may have injured himself while outdoors??? You don't offer much info as to breed/activity/age etc... some dogs tend to experience numerous joint problems due to their breeds which you may need to become educated on...There could be many possibilities in your dogs situation. First off, try eliminating the 'obvious' by examining the dog carefully & gently...your dog needs you his owner to figure out why he 'yelps_or_yips_or_whines as if in pain...common sense tells me that this is where you should begin...even a sticker or spur from the weeds can cause extreme discomfort...check his paws thoroughly first...then gently feel his legs bone structure, maybe you might notice some joint swelling or tenderness in a specific area...do this process with gentle loving care & slowly allow this process to be a trusting one between you & your dog... sometimes a dog can have a tick that wedged itself in between the paw pads where the fur & skin is...check very closely... IF after doing all you may wish to call a few local vets OR your local Humane Society for further advice & possible avenues toward assistance. I encourage you to check further...usually you will find options when an animal needs medical intervention & cost/expenses is a factor~ Just don't allow your pet to suffer needlessly without trying to find resolve!|`|qbP5uAuJaa	He's an elderly dog, and I think it's probably best for you to take your dog to the vet it could be serious especially at his age.

LxBwmRTlaa	Cat's purr when they are content and happy. They also purr during tense or traumatic moments.

It is advised puppies stay on their food while the calm down from leaving their familar surroundings to avoid more stress.     Then switch the food. If you are going to switch, you dont want to switch to a bad food either.     Feed her a tbsp of canned plain mashed pumpkin to stop her loose stool. Feed canned plain pumpkin (only 2 tbsp at most) with her meal for the next few days. Or you could go really plain and feed boiled meat with rice/oatmeal diet for three days or until stool is solid.     SD has nothing to do with rich, it has to do with it being Crap.

It is very bitter, they do not like the taste of it at all, in fact it will make them gag and drool excessively if it gets on their tongue. Best way I have found is to use half pills (whatever the dosage is for her weight -whether it is one or one and a half) then coat the halves in margarine and poke it in their mouth. I always give them canned food to eat right afterwards to help move the pill down the throat. Please research how to pill a cat if you're not sure or better yet, take the cat to the vet and have them give it tapeworm meds (usually droncit or drontal) I have 15 rescue cats and the praziquantel is what I give mine for tapeworms...I have one cat that is so mean because of the vet and them leaving her in pain.. that it is worth it to me to take her in and pay them to give her the pill.. and get bit for their troubles.

I am a dog groomer and have had to shave lots and lots of dogs due to heavy matting. the reason they need to be shaved is, it is lots kinder to shave rather than to try and de matt them. Your dog properly done will look fine.     Different?   Oh yes, but fine, you will be surprised how cute they look. It will take several weeks for your dog to get a bushier coat again. My advice with that type of coat is as soon as the dog starts to re-grow hair, brush brush brush! And keep regular appointments with a groomer to avoid having to be shaved again. You are doing a GREAT thing letting the dog get shaved down, it really is the kindest thing you can do! Ho|`|QVP8zSuWaa	If she is severely matted she will be shaved pretty close. I am sure they will try their best.     I have no idea what kind of hair that mix would have but I would say you need to be brushing her almost daily as soon as it comes back in, which should take about 3 to 6 months.

Look through the outside to the inside...and there she will be a cute as ever.  One thing you can do love is get a cute little t-shirt or fancy dress for her.  It will keep her warm (since she is used to hair) and you will have cleverly disguised her short hair cut.  It will take about 2 weeks to start growing out where you will see a noticeable difference and 3 to where you will start being happier with the look.  In Houston many people shave down there dogs in preparation for the heat...some do it because through the winter months they have gotten mats.  If you don't show others it bothers you and don't make a big deal of it....act like "just part of life" others won't make such a big deal of it either.

QpElKY8Kaa	I have no idea what crofton weed is.  I would NOT recommend mowing and just leaving it there.  If it's toxic to horses while growing, there's a very good chance that the toxicity is just as bad or, even more concentrated, by drying.<br>  <br>  My BFF vet told of an incident he personally knew about.  We have a noxious little weed called 'Yellow Star thistle'.  A horse breeder had a pasture full of it.  He mowed the field and a couple of days later turned his horses onto the field.  They ingested the thistle with the rest of the grass.  All 43 horses died.<br>  <br>  If you use a herbicide, the horse can't graze the sprayed over field.  You need some experienced help.

It's never easy to lose a beloved member of your family, regardless of his species.<br>  <br>  I've been to a number of funerals and memorial services for deceased humans, and their formats have varied widely. Some were very religious and formal, and others were less formal celebrations of the life of the deceased at which people took turns sharing happy memories of the person. Some funerals included hymns, some included candles, and some included everyday objects the mourners associated with the deceased. The point is that you can plan whatever kind of ceremony you feel would be best for honoring Mintey's life and providing comfort to the people he left behind. There are plenty of options to choose from.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest inviting only people who knew Mintey. That will probably mean your family and any friends who spent a lot of time at your house. These will be the people who will understand whatever symbolism you go with, whether it's serving baby carrots in memory of the excited way Mintey would grab his carrots and run off with them, or whatever else you find meaningful. If you choose to have people share their memories of Mintey, I suggest letting them know in advance that you'll be asking them to do that so they'll have time to think what to say.<br>  <br>  If Mintey was adopted from a shelter, you might want to make a donation to that shelter or the House Rabbit Society ( <a href="http://www.rabbit.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabbit.org/</a> ) in memory of him. Personally, I'm never comfortable with asking other people to make donations, but I do sometimes mention the donations I've made and hope my friends will get the hint that them making a similar donation would bring more comfort to me than flowers or sympathy cards.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I hope you'll be able to plan whatever type of ceremony would be most meaningful to you. If you don't want to have a ceremony at all, that's fine too. Do whatever you feel comfortable with. People mourn in different ways, and you should mourn in whatever way works for you.<br>  <br>  One final bit of advice: If you don't want another rabbit in your life at this time (e.g., if you're planning to go to college in a few years and know you won't be able to take a rabbit with you), you may want to mention this to the people around you. Otherwise, there's a chance one of them will seek to comfort you by showing up with a new rabbit to "replace" Mintey. It horrifies me that people do this, but it's happened to me! One of my guinea pigs had died the day before, and my veterinarian handed me a new guinea pig and said she was for me! I was aghast, because I'd just spent hundreds of dollars on vet care and had decided I'd wait until I had a better paying job before getting any new pets. Anyway, if any of your friends or relatives are the type of person to hand you a new rabbit and tell you his name is "Mintey II", you may want to make it clear that's not something you want. Even if you DO want to adopt another rabbit, you should be able to choose the rabbit yourself.<br>  <br>  Sorry again for your loss.
MjFLxahEaa	rabies need to enter the bloodstream somehow if the skin wasn't broken chances it didn't even if the dog is infected<br>  <br>  <br>  But then again rabies is 100% fatal as soon as symptoms show so you best not take a chance|`|5FEVLTufaa	If the dog hasnt shown any signs of rabies then go ahead with the trip but if you are still worried go to the hospital.

RpOGH8J9aa	Why be confined to an arena? This time of year in SE Idaho would be great for a horseback ride in the forest. From Blackfoot, or Idaho Falls go out towards Greys Lake & unload the horse & ride up by Caribou Mountain. It will be very enjoyable.
IMPvzBk1aa	To start, check with the county zoning department to see if your property zoning allows for operating a boarding facility.  Also check for the maximum number of horses allowed per acre.  Any building construction or rehabs may require county permits, so check with the permits dept. before construction.  Check fencing ordinances and waste management as well.  the county may have restrictions on what you can do with manure.  Also check on nuisance laws, which involve your neighbor's rights.  Drainage issues when keeping horses out on pastures can be a problem if the runoff to lower lands is contaminated by the manure, and that comes under state and county drainage law.  Insurance liability you can discuss with an insurance agent, but also get attorney advice on equine liability in your area.  Also get an attorney to assist in drafting a boarding contract, and formulate barn rules that are included in the contract agreement, and posted in the barn.  Good luck...I hope this doesn't scare you off.|`|ea073a7e51b6c89785bcfc0713212cf2aa	You'd need insurance, for starters... otherwise any injuries to humans or horses on your property would fall on your shoulders to pay for.  I don't think there are any laws regarding what knowledge or training you have to have in order to board.  Why don't you try calling animal control or the department of agriculture ?|`|muy1c9Adaa	I would contact the Sweet Grass County Extension service and the state about what is needed to start a Horse Boarding BUSINESS!  After all, your are going to start it for the money, right?!<br>  <br>  One thing you are going to find, is that you will probably need to keep at least $1 million worth of liability insurance coverage.  <br>  <br>  Another source is to go to your local library and look for books on Equine Law for Montana, or "The Equine Legal Handbook", or "Understanding Equine Law", for starters.  <br>  <br>  I would draw up a generic boarding contract/lease for each boarder to sign, but I would take it to my attorney first to make sure all the clauses regarding injury, etc. are attached.  Also, I would put a clause in about NO DOGS on premises....  <br>  <br>  This is just the tip of the ice berg.  Good luck!

T7QN2IzGaa	I am not an expert, but I judge in competitions. I am in no way talking down to you I just don't know how much you know, so please take no offense. Well western pleasure is typically judged on the smoothest, slowest, and most consistently ridden horse. This is judged mostly on the horse and less on the rider. Be careful watching hands. A shanked bit must be ridden with one hand only--this is a pet peeve of mine<br>  <br>  When I have Western pleasure working classes, they usually end up being pattern classes. We usually just refer to them as 'working western'. It is a pattern similar to a reining, but much more simplistic and less lengthy. As for western pleasure hack, I have never heard of it. It sounds like it may be like a class I ride in called, western stockseat, where you judge a class then a pattern all combined as one class. I wish you luck and I hope I was some help|`|X3bu0B8faa	Wow! nothing like getting thrown in the deep end, huh? In WP classes, what I watch for is that the horse is moving naturally, not like it is lame, those days are over! it should move with its ears even with the saddle gullet, any lower, and it will be dropping a bit low, Its ears should be relaxed, its face should be looking through the bridle with a happy expression. The rider should be riding one handed, unless using a snaffle(5 & under) When a change of gait is called for it should be immediate, not 10 steps later. You should also call for a Working lope,(they should show a faster pace) and an extended trot, make these guys show their horses aren't dead! Make sure that you have them back once they come to the center of the arena. The less use of reins to back the better! They should back up 5 steps. If you need a pattern,  set out a cone, ask for a small slow circle, a fast large circle,  with a change of leads go the other direction do it again and back. Ask for a dismount and remount. Make sure they check all their tack before remounting. Its a big no no not to check for safety! Good Luck and have Fun!|`|ITBH9kC4aa	You want to judge on the horses conformation and the way they carry themselves or are supposed to carry them self through each gait. The question you have to ak yourself...Does the horse look like a pleasure to ride? Also i would recommend goggling western pleasure judging or standards. It also depends on the level of the show are these thoroughbreds doing western pleasure or serious quarter horse show-ers. You should also be familiar with the proper attire for the class which you can also find on google. Just make sure you are informed before the show.... you dont want any pissed off people saying the judge cant do there job. Hope that helped you in time!!|`|tNcYywN6aa	With the western horses, you a looking for a long, relaxed frame. The horse should be accepting the bridle by extending his neck downwards. If it is a pretty serious competition then i would expect the riders to be one-handed in a curb bit. You will want to look at the length of the reins. If the reins are long and loose, then that will show the horse is relaxed. If they are short that might show the horse needs a bit of holding. The whole idea of western pleasure is that it gives the riders the chance to show of the smoothness and slowness of their horses gait. An ideal pleasure horse wants to be going as slow as possible, head down and relaxed whilst working from behind. An experienced pleasure horse's jog will be slower than an english horses walk. This is because if you were a cowboy and were out from dawn till dusk, then you could jog and lope all day, the horse using very little effort and you not ending up with a sore ****, like you would if you tried riding an english horse all day. Not really heard off pleasure hack and working, but what i would guess is that the hack class would be judged steadiness and calmness of the horses paces, for when there is no cattle to be hearded and you are just steadily making your way to a different heard. I would think that the working is more for when you are hearding, and it would be judged on the horses reactions to the aids as well as the steadiness and calmness. Basically, you are looking for both the horse and rider to be relaxing. Check for the horse fiddling with his mouth or opening it/crossing it. This is a sign of resistance against the hands. Also, check the riders spur use. The less theyare used, the better. Best thing would be to ask when you get there. Hope this has helped and good luck. 
B6zl0AJDaa	Apparently the Kieffer USA site is down at the moment.  <br>  <br>  Here's a Munchen AT  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/17-Kieffer-Munchen-AT-General-Purpose-Saddle-Save_W0QQitemZ180298758577QQcmdZViewItem?hash=item180298758577&_trkparms=72%3A1205%7C39%3A1%7C66%3A2%7C65%3A12%7C240%3A1318&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/17-Kieffer-Munchen-A...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/KIEFFER-WEIN-DL-PROFESSIONAL_W0QQitemZ180300351877QQcmdZViewItem?hash=item180300351877&_trkparms=72%3A1205%7C39%3A1%7C66%3A2%7C65%3A12%7C240%3A1318&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/KIEFFER-WEIN-DL-PROF...</a><br>  <br>  I copied and pasted the pictures to take a closer look at both saddles, however, the Wein seller says that he's had some custom alterations made on this saddle.  The Munchen looks like it sits it's rider more straight up and down, where as the Wein saddle looks like it tries to sit it's rider more forward.  Also the flaps on the Wein are a bit more suited for some sort of bend in the rider's leg.<br>  |`|kHeXKtKraa	No, sorry, I don't specifically know the difference between the two, BUT it sounds like the Munchen and the Wein are named after German cities to differentiate the two.  I had a Stuben Tristan for about 15 years and wore the dimples out of the place where my leg went.  When I went to find another one, I found that the new Tristan had a knee roll and thought they changed it.  When I finally sat in a new one, I found that it was only an update on the style and the position was the same. If you know that the two styles exist, maybe you know someone who has each one?  Can you ask the people if they will let you sit in their saddle and see for yourself?  If you are buying it new, the shop owner should be able to tell you the difference (and there might not be a difference other than leather finish (dimples vs smooth) or even billets (long vs short).  Also, the people at Kieffer, even though the site is German, will speak English well enough to answer your question if you email them.  (I am currently doing a search in Germany and have found that ALL government offices in Germany have someone available to answer questions in English)  Germans learn three languages in grade school and English is often one of them, so you should have very little trouble asking the Kieffer website for the differentiation.  Good luck, I hope this helps at least a little bit.  
R5q5OylIaa	INSECTS are fairly high in phosphorus and low in calcium, but do have nutritious value if not fed in abundance or as the soul diet. Most insects also have a hard indigestible exoskeleton that could cause a bowel impaction if fed in large quantities. All insects should be gut loaded with well balanced offerings of veggies and perhaps even some calcium and vitamins before being offered to reptiles. (See fruit and veggies below for some gut loading ideas)<br>  <br>        Insects that are fairly easy to purchase: crickets, mealworms (tenibrio), Super worms (tenibrio mealworms on steroids- I don't recommend these!), King mealworms (zophobas), and wax worms (very high in fat and very low in calcium- use only as a treat!), and earthworms.<br>  <br>        Insects that can occasionally be found locally or may be purchased by mail order: butterworms, grasshoppers, locusts, Hissing Roaches, cicadas, and silkworms ... (I'm sure there are many others!)<br>  <br>       If you would like to keep and breed your own insects to cut the cost of keeping your water dragon or other reptiles please see:<br>  Many people write to me asking if it is okay to feed their dragons insects that they have found in their yard. My answer is always "No". These insects may be contaminated by pesticides and or herbicides used in the area. Please do not risk your dragons life by feeding him wild caught crickets or other insects. :( Even if you don't use pesticides, someone in your neighbourhood might, and therefore the insects will likely be affected. There have been a number of studies done to see just how far chemical contaminants can travel, and it has been shown that almost every place in the world has been touched by chemical contaminants of some kind or another.<br>  <br>        It is not advisable to use insects that are not mentioned on this list as they may be toxic to your dragon. Over the summer a number of people were catching fireflies and feeding them to their herps- a number of these herps died. It seems that fireflies have some chemicals in them that are extremely poisonous. :(<br>  <br>  EARTHWORMS are fairly high in calcium, and are fairly well balanced nutritionally. They are also soft so the risk of impaction is lessened.<br>  <br>  WHOLE PREY food items are generally high in calcium and protein, and due to the calcium content should be included as part of the diet. Mader states in his Reptile Medicine and Surgery " Carnivorous lizards should be fed pre-killed whole prey. Rodents are preferable to chicks, and chicks are preferable to fish." he also goes to state " If mice, rats, rodents, rabbits and chicks make up the bulk of the diet, vitamin and mineral supplementation should not be necessary. It should be noted that newborn pinkie mice have less total calcium than do adult mice, and a calcium should be supplemented if these are used."<br>  <br>        A selection of whole prey food items would range from pinkie, fuzzie and adult mice, rat pups, some people have offered gerbil fuzzies?, young chicks (Mader himself used to feed his dragons chicks), and feeder fish such as minnows. Some people also offer small lizards such as anoles to their dragons as a food source.<br>  <br>        For more information about whole prey food items and why they are necessary for the general health and well being of our water dragons please see Diet- You need to feed whole prey food items!<br>  <br>        Most people feed these mice and other wholeprey food items dead to their dragons. It's much more humane. Besides if you are buying them live, then they must be eaten within 24 hours or else they will die anyway, plus when you buy frozen you can buy in bulk! (thaw before feeding to your dragon! :)) If you have a large adult dragon you may even feed it adult mice or even new born rat pups. Please see Why you should NOT feed live Rodent prey to your reptiles: for more on the dangers of feeding live prey.<br>  <br>  Why you should NOT feed live Rodent prey to your reptiles:<br>  <br>        Some people offer their reptiles live prey in the form of live pinkies, fuzzies, mice, rats etc. I've always been against this practice because it seems inhumane, and because of the risk of injury to the reptile being fed. It might be natural for the reptile to eat live prey in the wild, but when they are living in the wild they are also not confined to a small area perhaps with prey that they are not yet ready to eat. Live prey will defend itself. Live prey may also decide to bite or prey on the reptile if the animal is not interested in feeding and the rodent is left in the cage unattended.<br>  <br>        The April 1999 issue of Reptiles Magazine, Veterinarian Q&A by Dr. Douglas Mader, M.S., D.V.M., D.A.B.V.P. Page 18 states in reference to bites and injuries inflicted by rodents:<br>  <br>        "Now for the first question. Why is it that this is often a very serious and sometimes fatal wound? There are two reasons. The first is that rodents carry a number of very infectious bacteria on their teeth. Some of these bacteria are associated with rat-bite fever in people. When these bacteria are inoculated into the skin from the bite wound, certain types can produce a toxin that can be lethal to snakes. It doesn't take long for these toxins to be produced, and that is why time is of the essence in getting the snake to the veterinarian for treatment. Even if the offending bacteria are killed with antibiotics, the antibiotics will not kill or remove the toxin that the bacteria have produced. Any toxin that is produced will be absorbed by the host animal. If the bitten animal is strong and healthy, and only a small quantity of toxin has been produced, then there is a chance of recovery."<br>  <br>        "The second reason these wounds are often fatal is due to the actual mechanical nature of the wounds themselves. Rodents have a habit of gnawing when they eat. When they attack the predator, they usually make their first bite over the backbone region and then continue either toward the head or the tail of the snake with each successive bite. These bite wounds will often puncture the spinal cord. If this happens, an often fatal spinal meningitis will occur."<br>  <br>        Mader is discussing the fatal wounds on a correspondents' snake, but I'm 100% sure that the information he has states applies equally well to live rodents being fed to lizards. <br>  <br>  FRUIT AND VEGGIES:<br>  <br>        FRUIT AND VEGGIES: Some dragons will eat fruit and veggies when it's offered, but many dragons will not take fruit and veggies at all! Keepers that have success with this find fruit is preferred. Unfortunately fruit tends to be very high in phosphorus and very low in many other nutrients with the largest benefit being additional fluids and vitamins.<br>  <br>        Fruit that have good calcium content include figs, raspberries, cantaloupe, strawberries and blueberries ... starting to slide now on the amount of calcium ... I think mangos and papaya's are ok too?<br>  <br>        Veggies that have an adequate calcium to phosphorus ratio: Greens such as collards, dandelion (flowers edible too), and mustard greens. (Kale, spinach and other greens of this variety are high in oxalates which bind to calcium making it unusable) leafy veggies of the lettuce family have almost no nutrients thus are very low in value other than for their water content. Yellow squash, sweet potato, parsnips, green beans, and occasionally carrots ... Veggies such as broccoli contain oxalates and as stated above that binds to calcium rendering it unusable.<br>  <br>        Please NOTE that all of the well balanced fruit and veggies listed above can be used when gut loading your insects! <br>  <br>  <br>  A healthy Diet Combination- Ratio's<br>  <br>        I believe a healthy diet would be a combination of all of the above diet items, using as wide a variety of each item as possible, in the ratio of:<br>  <br>      * Insects 40% - 50%<br>      * Earthworms 10% - 20%<br>      * Whole Prey 40% - 20%<br>      * Fruit & Veggies 10%<br>            o (If possible, otherwise increase % of whole prey)<br>  <br>        Insects and earthworms should be gut loaded, and dusted with calcium supplement approximately every second day, dusted with vitamins once a week; It couldn't hurt to add some supplementation to the fruit and veggies if the dragon is eating them; unless it's pinkies that is being offered as the whole prey food item calcium supplementation shouldn't have to be added to these food items.<br>  <br>        Dragons receiving diets lower in whole prey food items should of course be getting more calcium supplementation than dragons getting higher quantities of whole prey. <br>  <br>  Are you supplementing the dragons diet with calcium and vitamins?<br>  <br>        Crickets, mealworms and waxworms should be dusted with a vitamin supplement (shake and bake method- put crickets in bag, pour in small amount of vit. supplement and shake, then feed to dragon!) supplement approx. once each week. You should also be giving him a calcium supplement at least every second feeding- as metabolic bone disease (MBD) will occur if your dragon does not get enough calcium in his diet, he will also need UVB lighting in order to metabolize the calcium, more on this later. Food sources such as insects should be gut loaded with nutritious food items, vitamins and calcium.<br>  <br>        Many people use commercial calcium products such as repcal as a calcium supplement, human calcium supplements may also be used (grind them to powder in the coffee grinder!), commercial vitamin supplements such as mineral-all and herptivite are also commonly used, again human vitamin supplements (centrum) could also be used after being crushed to powder.<br>  <br>        I give my dragons two or three drops of liquid Calcium-Sandoz once a week, you can buy this in a drug store.

XryBjeS7aa	Some people blanket their horse to keep them from getting much of a winter coat.  Some people do it because they feel their horse cannot handle the cold.  My gelding is still on the thin side and he has a blanket on all winter so he can put extra energy into fat rather than into keeping himself warm.  My mare runs around without anything on unless it gets to be less than 25 degrees F out.  Then she gets a blanket - that she probably doesn't need.<br>  <br>  Some people will tell you that you HAVE to blanket your horse - but this is not the case.  If you are showing in the early spring and do not want to show in a woolly winter coated horse, then blanket your horse.  Otherwise leave the blanket off - it is easier to care and better for the horse.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for a blanket - Orican makes a great turn out blanket that is water proof.  It is made of waterproof materials, not waterproofed after the fact.  So your horse will stay dry all winter and you do not need to worry about taking it to a professional to have it cleaned and waterproofed after every season.|`|awzl6Ewfaa	I do not blanket my horse.  She is on pasture 24/7 with a lean-to shelter she and her fieldmates can go in and out of as they please - I let her grow her winter coat in, and she is fine.|`|ZnzkYjEDaa	Keeps the saddle from sliding.

But a drawback of putting a blanket on a horse their winter coat does not get as thick as it would without the blanket. But also what we do in the winter to kepe out horses warm is feed them a lilttle extra because fat provides insulation|`|Se0eRd6Yaa	saddle blacket or winter blanket?|`|LE3WOS1Saa	We let the horses develop their own thick winter coat in Nov Dec.  Blankets are only used on a thin coated thoroughbred.  And on the other horses if the temp in the barn drops to zero F.  Or if we turn them out in 15 F or below when it is windy.  Blanketing early in the winter ( nov dec ) prevents horses from developing their own protective coats.  We keep the blankets in boxes to have on hand through the winter as needed.|`|zTcNHvNRaa	In the winter, after work for example, its good to put a fleece cooler rug on the horse, for about half an hour to an hour, so they dont catch a cold<br>  <br>  if it's cold, you should buy a thick, heavyweight stable rug, to put on your horse overnight, to keep him warm, I have a friend that also puts on a lightweight rug underneath that, to keep her horse even warmer, although it really depends on the weather, and you personal choice. my mare is fine with just a heavy weight rug.<br>  <br>  for the day time, it's good to put a lightweight rug if it's really cold, but it's not really necessary unless it's really cold. if its not, a fleece cooler should do just fine aswell. <br>  <br>  i dont personally use a turnout rug, cause my savings arent enough yet, and my parents refuse to buy me stuff for my horse, but it's useful to put one on, especially if you dont like taking hours cleaning mud off your horse, and it's good for him/her to be warm.<br>  <br>  However, it's not necessary to put on rugs during the summer when its hot, since the horse doesnt need the extra warmth, since all the fur grows back by then (if you clip your horse)<br>  <br>  Also, if your horse isn't clipped, or isn't blanket clipped, and hardly has anythick fur, you need thicker rugs.<br>  <br>  here are examples of the rugs:<br>  <br>  fleece: <a href="http://www.derbyhouse.co.uk/prodshow.asp?id=2565&cat=2&scats=48,87" rel="nofollow">http://www.derbyhouse.co.uk/prodshow.asp...</a><br>  <br>  heavyweight stable rug : <a href="http://www.derbyhouse.co.uk/prodshow.asp?id=2477&cat=2&scats=48,88" rel="nofollow">http://www.derbyhouse.co.uk/prodshow.asp...</a><br>  <br>  lightweight stable: <a href="http://www.derbyhouse.co.uk/prodshow.asp?id=2563&cat=2&scats=48,88" rel="nofollow">http://www.derbyhouse.co.uk/prodshow.asp...</a><br>  <br>  turnout rug: <a href="http://www.derbyhouse.co.uk/prodshow.asp?id=2408&cat=2&scats=48,86" rel="nofollow">http://www.derbyhouse.co.uk/prodshow.asp...</a>

OyTC9qalaa	this is very normal behavior. It should go away in a couple of days. The chicks are doing that because they are looking for food, and those little toes of the other chicks looks like a tasty snack.    Try taking your finger and tapping the food. The chicks should come running to it because it resembles a mother hen quail eating. This will help them understand that the stuff you are tapping is food.    If the chicks make each other bleed, change the heat lamp to a red one. You should be able to find them at a local feedstore.|`|MstjbpVJaa	As an Ex Quail breeder I believe your problem is your birds are looking for Live food such as White worm ,Meal worm,or similar,this to me is unusual as I have bred hundreds and never had this problem.it could be the other chick has the idea that there are worms in the shape of feet and is pecking them  Make sure feed them chick crumbs you may need to crush them further so to make them smaller,also make sure that any water is in a drinking tube not an open bowl or similar as Quail chicks have a habit of drowning themselves and getting water logged which chills and kills them.|`|4HkzM23Naa	It is normal and it will hurt the chick. its like in the wild survival of the fittest the one that is getting bullied by the other one is probably the weak one so if it gets to rough it is better to keep them apart till they are a bit bigger|`|IEny33FYaa	I've had quite a few in the past, and whenever I checked up on them a load were dead.

CtYqMs5Paa	For night time, move the crate into your bedroom so he's close to you...he'll sleep better knowing you are near by than in another room...as for tying, what they teach you in Obedience classes is tie your dog and step away.  ignore the bad behavior and don't release until the dog is calm.  when calm, release and praise after you release...increase distance each time and always wait until calm to release, eventually they learn the fits didn't get me untied any faster and the behavior stops.|`|qH7IA1Staa	my dogs did the same. 1st put him in the cage and say "quit" take a step back and if he start crying right when he starts say "SHHH" then repeat each time taking a step back. after each step when he's quit give him a treat :)|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Ignore him.  If he learns that there is no reward for crying he won't do it.  Whatever you do, DON'T let him out of his cage when he is crying.    Another thing you can try is putting a towel over his cage so he can't see out.  Also give him more exercise before bed so that he is tired and will go right to sleep.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Wear him out before you kennel him!  Run and walk him.  Lots of exercise.  Play with him.  And stop giving him treats in his kennel.  Also, you have not said, but you are probably talking to him while he is doing this.  The more you can ignore this behavior the better.  I know it is hard.  But, by acknowledging his howling you are giving him attention.      I hope you are not kenneling this dog outside.  I hope.    That is all I can suggest.  Good luck.    Edit:  With your additional information I would consult a behaviorlist and speak to your vet about mild sedatives.  You have a serious problem.|`|Il0QA1Hcaa	Those type of dogs do not like to be caged in. I have a samoyed she was the same way. We bought the little tykes play yard and kept her in there. We would put her in there while we were in the room watching Tv. Once she settled down we would go to bed. It was like having a baby. Her problem was she did not like anything over her head. We put her toys in the play yard as well so this became her space.|`|KvUJZa1Paa	take a 2 liter pop bottle and fill it with warm water and wrap it in a towel or old pillow case put in kennel, get a wind up clock that you can hear ticking and a stuffed animal with your scent on it. Play hard with puppy before bedtime when time for bed put all of the above things in kennel place puppy in and close door and put a blanket over it   this has always worked for me|`|qMhUhAALaa	Hello! sorry for your trouble! My first thought is that this pup is a wolf mix. Wolves are definitely mate oriented by nature. When they connect with a mate/friend, it is usually for life. So my thought would be that the dog has separation anxiety. that is a tough one. As hard as it might be, he needs to know you are near. You said he is fine when left alone roaming the yard, indicates that even though dogs/wolves are den animals(crated) your pup does not like being confined and alone at the same time. He may resent not having freedom, unfortunately he needs to be confined in my opinion while in puppy hood(just keeps them out of trouble and harmful things) Again, I would crate him close enough to you in a room until he realizes that there is a time during a 24hr period that he is alone. Hope this helps!|`|OxFsslN8aa	Dogs are pack animals and are not happy alone.  Put the cage in the bedroom with a human.

CtYqMs5Paa	Have you tried moving your evening feeding to an earlier time?  For puppies when crate training we always stopped food around 7-8pm to ensure there is time for the food to work it's way through...Just a thought that worked for us with all of our pups.|`|3wJGXfkKaa	Give him some time to get use to things and I would just feed him earlier and give him water a little less.  Take him out after he eats and before you go to be also, that might help.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Get him a nice kennel with the comfy bedding and crate him up at night.  It may take some time for him to get used to it, but this is your best bet.     Most of my dogs are rescues and almost all are kenneled every night.  That way they cannot soil the house, they are safe from anything they may get into and shouldn't, they sleep instead of playing with each other and they love their 'dens'.|`|nYv65TlEaa	does he have a crate,  a crate big enough for him to stand and turn aaround,he most likely not soil his bad,so if he is crated,he can't get to the water bowl,and he shouldn't potty where he sleeps,as he gets better zat holding it lets say a few weeks 4 or 5,I would unlock the crate once he gets it and learns how to strengthen his bladder...|`|LlCnUAnFaa	Try crate training during the night.  Most dogs won't soil where they sleep. You may try walking him around the block twice or a short run so he's tired and will sleep all night.|`|10e768f86234dcf1dc5a7fe31019497baa	a kennel in the garden will work fine.|`|IFiwmb3Haa	I would set an alarm and take him out in the middle of the night to keep this from happening.  You'll probably have to do this for a few weeks before he starts feeling more relaxed and comfortable in his new surroundings and gets a routine.|`|ADjeuxIiaa	There is no need to punish him or to wake up for a middle of the night walk. Simply change the times he's fed. Don't let him free feed. Feed him once in the morning and once in the afternoon (or one huge meal in the morning) and take away his water after 5pm. If it continues to be a problem, you can look into a doggy door to make it easier for him to take care of business himself.|`|CW7Sej2uaa	Try crate training.  He should be trained to be in a crate at night.  If you get the right size crate, just big enough for him stand and turn around in, he will stop.  Dogs will not soil where they sleep.|`|8jhtjNGoaa	Is it  2 or  1? If he's just weeing - make sure you don't give him any water an hour before bed, and then just leave out ice cubes. It keeps him from ingesting so much that he can't hold it. If he's pooing - then you probably will have to do the middle of the night toilet runs. Dogs are usually physically capable of holding it for about 8-9 hours. So if he's not getting out soon enough in the morning - you just have to get up earlier. And Luca's mom is right in that EVENTUALLY he'll know that he's supposed to only do it outside. Mine were rescues and as long as I got up nice and early and let them out I didn't have, um, landmines. And now I can sleep in just fine if I want. Good Luck!|`|N31EsEbEaa	if no luck with above posts try www.allyourpetneed.com seriously good information available by very experienced dog trainers and specialist guarenteed to improve dog behaviour.|`|jDuSXZETaa	feed him earlier than usually do and make sure he goes out before you go to bed.set your alarm and get up to let him out.i no alot of people that use a crate at night as they say that a dog shouldn't go to toilet when they in such a small area but mine did.i have a chocolate labrador and she didn't stop doing it till she was about 6 moths old but it was for attention as she didn't like being put in the kitchen.she is now nearly 3 and hasn't gone to toilet since she was 6 months old which was when we let her start sleeping upstairs with us.have you tried putting radio or something on.they saythat'ss supposed to help to.i now have another pup,she also chocolate lab and she 2 months old and i going through the same thing with her  and its not the nicest thing to wakeup to i no,lol
e49de377def7dc80a5baa53274275b3baa	that's about a 16 us gallon tank    you could easily fit  6 neon tetras  6 guppies (2 males and 4 females)  6 rasboras (which is another schooling fish)  3 cory cats or 3 otocinclus for the bottom    the above are all low waste fish, so wouldn't be a problem for that sized tank at all    just make sure your tank is completely cycled before introducing any fish in your tank  here is more info on cycling a tank  http://www.americanaquariumproducts.com/...|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	The usual rule we go by here in the US is one inch of fish per gallon of water.  I think that's a little less than a centimeter per liter.  60 liters is about 15 gallons and those fish grow to about two inches, so you should have no more than 7 or 8 fish.  Since neons and guppies are schooling fish, I think it would be better to choose one kind or the other than to try to mix them.  Most schooling fish prefer schools of five or more of their own kind, so three of one and four of the other might not make them comfortable.    [edit]  Fish Man, I agree that the rule isn't entirely reliable, but if anything it's not strict enough.  It would be downright inhumane to put a 10-inch oscar in a 10 gallon tank.  The poor thing would hardly be able to turn around and he'd be choking on his own waste if you didn't do daily water changes.  15 one-inch fish or 7 2-inch fish would be appropriate for a 15 gallon tank.  Twelve two-inch fish would be overcrowded, maybe not visibly in terms of space, but based on oxygen consumption and waste production.  Guppies produce more waste than average for their size so I'd keep fewer of them in a tank that size.    Ddubs, both guppies and neons are schooling fish that prefer to be in schools of five or more of their own kind.  Six of each would be too many fish for that size tank.  If you stick to neons you could get as many as eight, or you could get five neons and three otocinclus catfish to add some variety and control the algae.|`|AA11708471	6 neon tetras and 6 guppies  or  7 neon tetras and 5 guppies  or  8 neon tetras and 4 guppies  or  9 neon tetras and 3 guppies  or  8 neon tetras and 2 guppies    EDIT: ConcernedCitizen that rule is dumb and does not work accuratly their are other things you need to take into account    Btw 1 inch per gallon is 2.54cm of fish per 3.78541178 litres  But the is terrible anyway

4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Homeopathic Arnica is just fine.  I would use a 30C.  You can dissolve a pellet in a very small amount of filtered water and give with a dropper.    The thing with using homeopathic remedies is OBSERVATION.  If the limping or swelling goes away with a single dose you don't repeat it.  If symptoms come back then you can redose.  As long as there is improvement you DON'T redose.    You can start him off with two doses spread out over a 24 hour period if the pain and swelling are acute.|`|P8CBDLiKaa	Don't give him any; Arnica can be toxic and should never be taken internally.  If you use an Arnica liniment or ointment topicaly, the cat will lick it off and could be poisoned, possibly fatally.    What you need to do is get him to a vet.      EDIT:  for the record?  Homeopathy is voodoo BS.  Save your money and sprinkle holy water; you'll get a better result.  Unless he dies.    GO TO A VET.|`|p7ZdohGTaa	A four month old kitten should not be limping for any other reason, than there is some sort of injury. If that is the case, the kitten needs to be seen by a vet. Herbal remedies won't fix a break. If the kitten cannot walk on his back leg, he must be seen by a vet, and right away. If it is broken, it could heal and set incorrectly, and then he could suffer permanent damage.|`|iDxoM3X8aa	I know you want to help the cat but yes you may be doing the wrong thing you need a vet to look at the cat good luck.|`|Gem96NQyaa	Don't give him any.  Take him to the vet.  While homeopathic arnica is generally safe for cats and dogs (NOT to be confused with the herbal remedy arnica, which is toxic if injested), for such a young kitten to be limping could be much more than just a sprain or bruise (which is primarily what arnica is for).    It's far more likely that there's a break that may need to be set, or it could cause permanent damage to the leg.

This means a cat most likely sees in 3-D; very useful for judging distance. Cats have an elliptical pupil which opens & closes much faster than round types and allows for a much larger pupil size. This allows more light to enter the eye. Cats appear to be slightly nearsighted, which would suggest their vision is tailored more for closer objects, such as prey, that they can capture within running distance. Objects farther than several hundred yards rarely interest a cat.<br>  Cats also have a mirror like membrane on the back of their eyes called a Tapetum.<br>  It reflects the light passing through the rods... back through the rods a second time, this time in the opposite direction. The combination of elliptical pupils and the Tapetum permit cats to see extremely well in near darkness. <br>    The picture on the left is how a human would see in near darkness and on the right, how a cat would see. In low light, like night, color and hue are not perceived, only black, white and shades of gray.<br>  Cats have both rods and cones in the retina. Rods are the receptors that the eye uses for night time viewing and sudden movement. Cones are used during the daytime and process color information. Cats have more rods than cones, as compared with humans, making cat night and motion vision superior to humans.<br>  Cats responded to the colors purple, blue, green and yellow range. Red, orange and brown colors appear to fall outside cats color range and are most likely seen as dark to mid shades of gray.<br>  Cats appear to see less saturation in colors than do humans,<br>    meaning cats do not see colors as intensely or vibrantly. Purple,<br>     blue & green appear to be the strongest colors perceived by cats|`|JOFKy8pFaa	I have heard that cats are color blind to a point but I had a deaf cat who would only allow me to put a blue collar on her because it matched her eyes.  She would sit in front of a mirror and admire herself for hours when she had a blue collar but any other color of collar she would work hard to remove it.<br>  <br>  I also had another cat who only liked green collars, her eyes were green.<br>  <br>  Their whiskers are to help them see in the dark and to judge how close they are and if an opening is wide enough for them to get through.<br>  <br>  Cats are nocturnal animals so they take naps throughout the day and night, I'm not sure how that makes them nocturnal but they are more active at nights.|`|TnX18yAfaa	they can see movement very easily due to the way most cats eyes are  vertical slits, I think they see in Black and white and they can see very well at night|`|9M8WY2vJaa	how long have you had a cat<br>  cats see what they want<br>  they sleep so much because they can<br>  whiskers to help them move around in the dark|`|AA11934121	As said in this link, describes a cat's range of vision -<br>  <a href="http://kittyshow.com/x_cat_vision_night...." rel="nofollow">http://kittyshow.com/x_cat_vision_night....</a><br>  <br>  "Cats can see almost as well as humans can, and at times better.

They are richly supplied with nerve endings, whiskers give cats very detailed information about air movements and pressure and any object they touch.|`|IdiwjLjbaa	whiskers are for balance and to know if they can fit through a hole, etc. I think cats see colors.  As far as why they sleep so much, probabaly boredom.

They have far superior vision ability though, especially in very dim light.  Thier eyes also glow in very dim light, like reflectors on a car...helping to illuminate the darkenss.  They also have a huge field of vision-more the twice that of a human. <br>  <br>  I don't know why they sleep so much...one thing I know about my cat is that she's not always sleeping when she appears to be.  It's like she's just faking us out, and spying on the family...or maybe waiting for some action.<br>  <br>  Whiskers are for extra sensory purposes when they're in the dark.  Their whiskers help them sense if there's something nearby, like a wall or an enemy.

They do leave turds on the carpet but they are easy to get up because they are almost dry.  It's the urine you have to worry about being in the carpet.

enNSH7Dbaa	hola<br>  <br>  lo que tienes que hacer es adiestrarlo <br>  <br>  consejos:<br>  <br>  Cuidados básicos para ganarnos su confianza:<br>  <br>  Los loros son animales exóticos, por lo que son especies muy delicadas que necesitan algunos cuidados básicos como un control veterinario. En la primera visita, le debemos practicar el recorte de vuelo, eso es algo que podrás decidir volver a hacer cada a?o, pero para adiestrarle es imprescindible.<br>  <br>  Su jaula nunca debe ser redonda porque causaría estrés en el animal. Su ubicación dentro del hogar es muy importante para que se sienta seguro, además siempre deberás respetar su territorio, puesto que son muy posesivos.<br>  <br>  Por último, debes saber que existen alimentos muy tóxicos para ellos como el chocolate, el aguacate, la berenjena y la sal, puesto que sus ri?ones no están preparados para filtrarla. Tampoco son recomendables los productos lácteos, el azúcar o las carnes. Las semillas (pipas de girasol, almendras, nueces, etc.) normalmente les encantan, pero no debemos abusar de ellas porque son alimentos con un alto porcentaje en grasa y sólo sacian su apetito sin apórtale los nutrientes necesarios. <br>  <br>  La decisión de recurrir a un adiestrador:<br>  <br>  Cuando alguien decide estrechar los vínculos con su loro, siempre suele optar por llevarle a un adiestrador. Muchos dan por hecho que a su regreso, dicho animal, estará dispuesto a dejarse coger o hablará por los codos. Nada más lejos de la realidad. <br>  <br>  Un loro sólo obedece al que considera su líder y este mérito hay que ganárselo día a día. Es fundamental que perciba que su vida depende de esa persona y debe sentirse protegido por ella. Esto sólo se consigue si lo hemos tratado, cuidado, manipulado y respetado nosotros mismos. Por ello, no nos sirve de nada que respete al adiestrador, si a nosotros no nos ve como a sus due?os. <br>  <br>  Tú como adiestrador:<br>  <br>  Lo que realmente funciona es que tú te conviertas en su líder. Para ello tendrás que encargarte de su educación y demostrarle que sabes tratarle, comprenderle, guiarle y protegerle. Al principio será difícil, sobre todo si muestra signos de desconfianza encrespando sus plumas, lanzando picotazos o gru?endo. Poco a poco, puedes llegar a mantener una buena relación con él, y evitar así que pase el resto de su vida encerrado en una jaula.<br>  <br>  Uno de los primeros problemas suele ser el miedo a los picotazos. Debes evitar quitarle la mano con brusquedad si te va a picar, puesto que nunca debe notar que le tienes miedo. Con el paso del tiempo la relación se irá estrechando y la reacción de intentar picarte cuando te aproximes desaparecerá. Tenemos que tener en cuenta que nos pica para defenderse, no para hacernos da?o.<br>  <br>    Las claves del éxito :<br>  <br>  No pierdas tu tiempo, ni le tortures intentando que diga su primera palabra. Si tu loro no habla, es porque no le apetece relacionarse contigo. Ante esta situación sólo puedes proporcionarle todo cuanto necesita física y emocionalmente para que sea feliz. Si logras que él esté a gusto te los agradecerá hablando y respetándote. La paciencia es fundamental y lo más difícil es conseguir que diga su primera palabra, después el aprendizaje se acelera. <br>  <br>  En definitiva, las claves son paciencia y cari?o. Si tienes tiempo, nadie mejor que tú para adiestrarlo y ense?arle algunos trucos. <br>  <br>  mas informacion:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mascotasyhogar.com/mascotas/aves/?pagina=mascotas_aves_040_040" rel="nofollow">http://www.mascotasyhogar.com/mascotas/a...</a><br>  <br>  saludos<br>  <br>  |`|scFigy51aa	bueno en realida tienes <br>  <br>  q hablarle durante un largo tiempo <br>  <br>  asi aprender a hablar <br>  <br>  o si no puedes darle vino <br>  <br>  a mi abue le funciono<br>  <br>  y ese dia no paro de hablar <br>  <br>  un poco mas y mi ma casi lo mata jejeje<br>  <br>  espero haber ayudado|`|CPrqmKUXaa	dale miga de pan con azucar y vino y vas haber como habla. suerte|`|d22bc5f37206e4e092d98615fd7965cbaa	Felicidades por tener un animal de estos! Son encantadores y son mascotas para toda la vida. A los 5 meses es un buen momento para empezar a ense?arle a tu loro a hablar.  Hay cassetes con frases especiales y chistosos que puedes comprar y poner a que escuche durante el dia o mejor en la noche cuando este tranquilo sin distracciones, o tu mismo puedes grabar con tu voz en una grabadora repitiendo la frase que quieres que aprenda muchas veces hasta que empiece a imitar los sonidos.  Tambien cuando le hables, siempre utlices frases adecuadas a la ocasion. Por ejemplo siempre en la ma?anas decirle "Buenos Dias",  en la noche "Buenas noches",  cuando te vas, decirle "Bye bye" o "adios" etc. Asi el loro aprendera usar la frase necesario en el momento correcto.  Si te es posible, ponle el radio durante el dia para que este escuchando musica o gente hablando. Tambien a los loros les gusta mucho escuchar musica, sobretodo, si es loro amazon, les gusta mucho la opera.   A mi loro le fascina ver la television y ver las cariacturas.

AA10283901	Wow, no they are not.  There is a reason he's barking and it could be anything.  To help you correct the issue, you need to find out why it's happening first.<br>  There are help-websites for things like this, too.  You could try key words like golden retriever, dog training, dog barking, etc.<br>  Have you considered obedience training?  That's what I would do . . . your basic classes will help you with these sorts of issues.  Please don't be abusive to your dog and you are correct in knowing that's why he's now aggressive.

qqLwdrfpaa	As mentioned, neutering can help. And it can be a sign of dominance, too. I had to break my female dog of humping my male dog - as funny as it was. If the behavior continues, you should look into asserting your dominance over your pet. It's very important that the animal recognizes you as the boss. Dominance rolls are a good way to start.<br>  |`|9FKbKR5gaa	This is natural behavior for puppies. What it is is a game of dominance. You should work on a few things so your puppy learns that you and your husband are the leaders. Some dogs don't exhibit that behaivor. My puppy loved doing it to a stuffed animal, but never to me. He still plays that game with other dogs if they don't tell him to cut it out. It doesn't have anything to do with neutering. My parents have two females that do that, it's nothing sexual, it's dominant behavior.  |`|KOI4YMH5aa	He should calm down when you have him neutered.

e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	Just keep working on the things you're doing for another year.  Then you can start longeing/round pen work, putting tack on her and generally getting close to riding her.  The earliest she should be ridden is 2.5, but later would even be better.  To add some new things over the next 1-2 years, you can start de-spooking her by setting up little obstacle courses to lead her through, with various scary things to negotiate.  Also, train her to respond to voice commands for halt-walk-trot so it will make things much easier when you longe her, and even ride her.|`|LdWh47Ttaa	im only 13 but ive already started my own horses that go on to do working cow events. i learned everything i know from my mom who has been a cow horse trainer for over 20 years, but anyways you can satrt breaking them a couple months before they turn two. so what you want to do is take it slow, if she is cooperating well, pick it up a little. you should lunge her for a couple of days and take a bunjee cord and hook it to her bit and the saddle so it bends her neck around, kiss to her and encourage her to turn that way, do that to both sides. you can also take two bunjee cord put them on both sides of the bit and hook the other sides of the bunjee cords under the cinch where the brest collar hooks and lunge her, this excersize helps her learn to put her head down. when you first get on practice getting up on to see if she will care, bump her a lttle slide your foot over her butt, etc. when you first get into trotting and loping, make sure she on the right lead and give her little bumps with both reins to get her head down, when its down, release the slack and keep doing that. <br>  <br>  hope i helped lots:)|`|a1acfa439fbad0e3325483edcfd4abd8aa	Read books and get videos from various trainers such as John Lyons, Chris Cox, Clinton Anderson, Stacy Westfall, etc.  You didn't mention if you are a teen or an adult, so be sure no matter what, you are safe when you do this training program.

When a horse comes to me to train I'd like it to know how to lead, to stand tied, to be touched all over and to be very good about it's feet.  Other than that I'd rather that you didn't do anything else.  You could teach her to lunge, to carry a bit and saddle and a bunch of other things but if you sent her to me I'm going to do it all over again anyway and I may have to fix things that you taught her that I'd rather she didn't do. <br>  What I'd most like you to do is to turn her out in as big a pasture as you can manage and let her be a horse.<br>  Or, if you really want to do something I'd like it if you'd teach her to pony, ie. lead while you're riding another horse.  Then just take her for rides.<br>  Or, even better, pick who you'd like to start her training now and ask them at what age they'd like to get her and what they'd like her to have done before they get her.  Hopefully they won't want to see her until at least the fall of her 2yr old year or later.

The pups will need vet checks, with deworming and vaccines.<br>  <br>  It's best that you spay your dog.|`|e20e778807f334f6575085b3abdf95fcaa	Some dogs are that are bred to have small hips can have complications.|`|Bw18seFqaa	There are all kinds of risks with breeding dogs..  not just the possability of needing a cecarian!<br>  <br>  I know someone who had a well planned out breeding.  CH and titled dogs, all health clearances done, etc.  Prenatal visits done, etc.<br>  <br>  About 2 weeks before the due date, the breeder noticed a loss of girth in the female.  She had no other signs or symptoms that indicated a problem, and none of her prenatal vet visits before this showed a problem.<br>  <br>  The breeder took the dog into the vet..  xrays revealed that her 5 pups had died inside of her and were rotting away.  She needed a $4,000 surgury to remove the pus-filled uterus and what remained of the puppies.<br>  <br>  The pus was as thick as bread dough..  and all that was left of the pups was 2 partial bodies..  the rest had completely rotted away. <br>  <br>  Had the dog not recieved treatment, she would have died.  There was no explained reason for why this happened.. everything was well-planned.. both dogs were healthy, etc.|`|34uWa9kHaa	She could die.  If she would need a c-section, she could die from going into shock, needing blood, being put under.  That will run you around $2000 if you are lucky.   If she dies you would have to bottle feed the pups.  That is VERY expensive. Puppy formula is not cheap.<br>  When pups are old enough lets see a trip to the vet for a litter of 9 for first shots and health certificates is gonna cost over $300.   <br>  I have not included worming and some other stuff.<br>  <br>  I posted some of the costs that I myself have had to deal with.  This was not even for my dog, someone dumped her prego and all.<br>  Guess they found out some of the costs... :(<br>  |`|AA11709234	I just had a bit ch that had a litter...of TWO and one was born via c-section.  So, it cost a pretty penny.  I was prepared, since you need to be ready for anything when you breed.  I also have not had a good nights sleep in a week, and have not left the house in a week.  So, if you breed, make darn sure you have the time and money for anything!!!!!<br>  <br>  Not to mention a good quality female and all her health clearances!!!!!<br>  <br>  **And my dog is a 135 pound Newf...so it is not just the small breeds that need c-sections!!!!|`|7e3CgdDHaa	I am all for the RESPONSIBLE BREEDING OF DOGS IF...<br>  -Both parent dogs are Champions, winning numerous titles in show or fieldwork of some kind.<br>  -Your dog is healthy with no medical conditions that come with the breed, or conditions outside of the breed<br>  -You are or are armed with a responsible breeder and their mentor<br>  -You have more than a few people, who want to show the dog and not keep it as a pet, waiting for the puppies. By this I mean you have a list of owners, and a backup list consisting of 3 or 4 possible owners.<br>  -You or your breeder has gone through the 5 year training course intended to become a breeder<br>  -Your dog is one of the 95% of purebreds that is fit to breed<br>  <br>  If you want to breed your dog, please follow all these guidelines. Your dog could be too young or too small or not built to have puppies and need a c-section, or die in the labor process. Not spaying your dog will increase her chance of having cancer, and she will definately die earlier than if you don't breed her at all. Having puppies will change your dog's mentality, she will never be as sweet and kind as she was before.|`|AA11729393	you should only breed if your a registered breeder .. there is thousands of puppies and dogs put down each year because people want cute puppies then they get sick of them because they don't have the time or patience to put in the effort of training the pup...<br>  With that said if you still intend to breed keep in mind that breeding is very expensive, your dog will need to be xrayed at 45 days into pregnancy to see how many puppies there is, so when she has them you know there isn't any left in there, which can lead to complications and the C section will cost you approx $500 if she did need one(Our dogs mother needed one as 2 puppies wouldn't budge!)!.Also keep in  mind after 24 hours dog and puppies should be looked over by the vet to make sure there healthy, also they will need to be vaccinated, wormed, defleed ETC so you will be looking at approximately $200 for each puppy with these plus the cost of food and all puppies should leave your house with a puppy pack of the food there eating so there not getting diarroer when they new owners put them onto different food, new food needs to be introduced gradually ....with all that said weigh up the pros and cons and if yous can afford it, as if your dog has 8 puppies (the average) that's $1600+ out of pocket plus an Extra $500 on top if she did indeed need an emergency c section!|`|uNrf8CHKaa	As an experienced dog breeder. Unless your vet has told you otherwise, your dog should be fine. The only physical complications that could go wrong that you may be able to see without speaking to a vet would be if your dog has a belly button looks like a 'bubble' then I don't recommend her having puppies unless this is fixed first. Other then that you should really ask your vet about that. If she is in good physical health nature will take its course & she should be fine. Make sure the male 'father' isn't too much bigger then your dog also it would be best to find a male that is smaller to reduce your chances of complications. The smaller the puppies the better, because of course dogs go through just as much pain as people do but without the drugs to help their pain. I hope this helps you out! -Erika|`|BpPre6hLaa	Take your dog to the vet and have her fixed. You'll be sparing the lives of dogs and puppies in shelters, and you'll save yourself the "hassle"  and expense of breeding your dog properly.<br>  Please. Just avoid breeding all together. It should be saved for the professionals. Dogs in shelters everywhere will thank you :)<br>  <br>  And yes, with all dogs (and especially small breed dogs) there is ALWAYS the risk of complications that can be VERY expensive.|`|BxgJGP62aa	Your dog could be killed in the breeding, she could turn on the puppies and kill them, she could need a costly c-section, she could get a puppy stuck and die, the puppies could be sickly and need hundreds of dollars of care per puppy, you could get no offers for puppies and be forced to dump them at a shelter, you could sell the puppies to puppy mills or dog abusers...<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Aww, yay, Judgerz!  I usually post that link but am on my laptop and don't have it.  I was very sad.|`|hQUe3o6Raa	Why do you need to breed your dog?  All kinds of things can go wrong.    The whelping process can kill her, and c-sections can cost thousands.  Pregnancy is stressful and painful for the mother.  If you really love your dog, get her spayed.  You are not doing her, or the world, any favors by bringing more puppies into a world that already has too many.|`|pFwMIMLAaa	Is your dog big or small? I think if it is a small dog you have a higher risk that she will need a c section. However you shouldn't breed her unless she is akc and has been tested and can better the breed. You need to do a lot of research, and make sure you have the money in case she needs a c section.|`|LCQCWWnoaa	breeding is risky in general, and there is a large overpopulation problem in the world. If you love your dog and would be heart broken over her death, it is a very stupid idea, also, it gets VERY costly fast!

Option 2 is place chicken on the ground and lightly step on the neck with the base of the head touching your shoe. When ready, while holding the body of the chicken, apply pressure by pulling the chicken away. The head will 'pop' off...Just don't let go after words because it WILL move around without the head. Each way is an instantaneous death. I have done this many times. I first learned it in the Army during SERE school. Fun stuff.<br>  <br>  ...sorry if anyone is offended or disgusted.

The Black Moor (a fancy Goldfish) is a coldwater fish, very messy, gets the size of a tennis ball (excluding fins), can be quite a bully and will fin nip those long guppy fins.<br>  <br>  While Guppies do better at warmer temps than Goldfish, will be more fragile to water quality as they are smaller, a Goldfish can wreck water quality quite easily without very close attention to tank maintenance.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't personally.  |`|zHz6FTRNaa	So long as you feed your fish regularly, I don't think you should have any problems. And you may also want to ensure that the tank is big enough that the two fish won't get at each-others' throats, as this mayy lead to bullying and eventually, the death of your guppie (bigger fish will sometimes nibble at the fins of smaller fish, which eventually kills them as they are no longer able to swim properly)|`|VF81xlBOaa	No i dont recommend it.<br>  I used to keep thwm together but my fancy guppy bit my black moor.
zHz6FTRNaa	I know what you're talking about, but I don't know enough of the proper terms to explain it to you properly, so I will simply cut and paste a nice little paragraph off the net for you:<br>  <br>  "The dog's penis actually has a small bone in it, as well as a bulb near the base on either side, which swells 5 times its size with blood, once the dog has his penis inside the ***** and begins 'thrusting' in preparation to ejaculate.<br>  This bulbous, along with the female's vaginal muscle, ensures that the 'tie' cannot be broken until all the semen is pumped from both testicles, which happens as alternative spurts from each teste. <br>  Once the tie has occurred, you MUST WAIT until the female relaxes her vaginal 'locking' muscle and breaks the tie to release the male.<br>  If you attempt to pull them apart, you will cause serious pain and damage to both the male and the female dog.<br>  Pulling them apart will not prevent a pregnancy.<br>  By the time the female has 'tied' the dog, he has already ejaculated and enough of the sperm are on their way to the fallopian tubes, (where her eggs wait to be impregnated) to make a pregnancy. <br>  The 'tie' only assures that the seminal fluid - the ejaculate - will not leak back out and the slower sperm have a chance to swim up to the fallopian tubes."|`|uuquyzBbaa	Dogs don't always get stuck while mating, but it can occur. Also, dogs are not the only animal this happens to. A lot of species, for example deer, get stuck while mating. It occurs when the male of the species' genitalia becomes engorged and cannot easy exit the female genitalia.|`|u6cEOW5caa	Not sure what an elephant's butt has to do with mating-but anyway.<br>  This happens to cats. Same reason as the girl above me. Nature's way of having them "finish the deed."|`|nhmp6rVyaa	Why don't u ask ur dog?
IUpIHFTKaa	I have a Russian Blue and he was also neutered.  He is the most affectionate cat I have ever had.  I don't believe it will change his "personality".  Talk with your vet, that's what he took the training for.|`|YBcB0732aa	Spaying doesn't affect personality or disposition.<br>  <br>  "Other than the previously mentioned behavior changes, spaying or neutering your cat<br>  is unlikely to change his or her basic personality, though male cats may become more<br>  docile following neutering. Cats’ hunting skills, playfulness, and general levels of activity,<br>  excitement, and vocalization do not typically change following spay/neuter surgery"|`|4f928be0b9419dfd5070c2a489577792aa	I wouldnt worry about it too much.  He might be a little different for the first couple days but will be just as sweet, if not more so, after he heals.<br>  <br>  I just love Russian Blues!  |`|4TX26viFaa	We were hoping neutering would calm our cat down..........it didn't.  I doubt yours will show any shift in personality either.|`|768111555ea193cbaa27a5b9ff4a2dbcaa	I don't think you'll see a big change-he'll maybe mellow out a bit but I very much doubt it'll alter him completely. I've had five or six cats, all neutered, and all with brilliant personalities!|`|AA10561878	Put yourself in his paws.|`|gaihXB5Iaa	he will be embarrassed|`|aP4bkYOCaa	You won't see much of a change. The only difference I can think of is that he will not be inclined to roam so much, which really works out in your favor. He'll be a little sore and sedated after surgery, but he'll bounce back in no time- I promise. :)|`|RN1wGlWWaa	The biggest change will be that he will not be interested in finding unspayed females, not getting aggressive and he will become happier and healthier.<br>  <br>  If you want him to keep the amazing personality - get him done and have peace of mind.<br>  <br>  Male cats will spray and its almost impossible to get out the tom cat odor, so schedule him now.
gJlxZdL5aa	Well as far as fairly active dogs go....<br>  <br>  Shetland Sheepdog (sheltie)<br>  Border Collie (since you already have a collie mix maybe you should try the collie family)<br>  German Shorthaired Pointer (I personally like this breed)<br>  Labrador<br>  Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever (I love this breed not quite as big as a golden)<br>  Husky<br>  Austrailian Cattle Dog<br>  Blue Heeler<br>  <br>  Don't pick a dog just because we say so.....be sure to research all sorts of breeds and see whats best for your family....Since you already have experience with a collie mix why not stick with the herding breeds...I have listed a few<br>  <br>  good luck on your search|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	I would say <br>  Golden retriever<br>  Husky<br>  German shepherd. <br>  <br>  Also know that you can resuce pure breeds. You should also make sure that when you pick out a new dog that both dogs will get along. |`|zZZnQuQJaa	A nice Lab or Golden Retriever is perfect for a Family.  Both will love playing with the other dog and the kids!|`|YoZZDqq9aa	Labrador Retriever will fit the bill.|`|toDMCzbkaa	Every dog breed can be a good family if properly socilized and trained.<br>  <br>  If you want to hear answers like : Labrador or Golden Retriever or German Shpherd then you are worng.<br>  <br>  My Personal fevorite is Rottweiler or German Shepherd. But there are other just as good Fila Brasileiro, Cane Corso, Presa Canario Dogo Argentino, Bull Dog, American Bull Dog, Pit Bull every damn dog on earth is good. Depends on you, how much you can spends in terms of time and money to treat them how they are likely to be.|`|TJGOfAbFaa	I would say get a small, cute and trust me very adventurous little Lhasa Apso. They are the best. They are a perfect family dogs. They are like babies more than just a dog. I have one and she is very active. She walks around 5 kms in one day. She is the best. Lhasa Apso are generally very friendly with the family members and other dogs. I would definitely recommend you to get one toy breed as you already have two medium sized dogs.<br>  <br>  - Hope you liked my suggestion.|`|QPr6XYXUaa	Yorkshire Terrier of Bichon Frise.<br>  I have both and they get along together just fine and love ppl.<br>  They yorkie tends to be a little more playful, tho the Bichon is active also but like to be held in your lap netime your sitting down.<br>  <br>  THese dogs are both hypoallergenic which is good and they won't shed!!! Good luck finding a family dog|`|WiycCxpzaa	Heather O - She asked for a purebred, not a mutt. Goldendoodle is far from purebred.<br>  <br>  Goldens are great dogs, so are Labs. And Labs are very active/energetic. You can find a purebred rescue im sure in your area so you have best of both worlds. <br>  <br>  Here's a test to match your lifestyle to a certain breed, I suggest giving this a shot.<br>  <a href="http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/dogselector.do" rel="nofollow">http://animal.discovery.com/breedselecto...</a>|`|naxV7TERaa	    Maybe a golden retriever or a lab? Even a shepherd if you would like protection. Would have said great dane but their huge couch potatoes :))|`|ts7sAEplaa	golden retriever...even the goldendoodles (golden retriever+poodle) they are great!|`|hT8kLYTJaa	golden retreiver or lab|`|z7aoAeHzaa	bulldog|`|RjUhISEIaa	Those who have answered with golden retrievers are right on the $$$. <br>  <br>  We've owned both labs and goldens. Labs have a tendency to be a little higher strung than the goldens. Both are intelligent dogs but our golden was so much smarter than any lab we've ever owned. Imagine a dog that new 147, yes 147, different commands that encompassed both verbal and hand. Can't say that yours will be the same but with work you'll definitely get close.<br>  <br>  As for being active you've got it. As for being great around another dog this should not be an issue but you may have to work on the older one. If you can find a golden puppy you shouldn't have a problem at all. As for being a family pet there is none better with children or adults. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|QC94lBXOaa	Labs or retrievers are great family dogs and have LOTS of energy. If you get them young they adapt well to whatever "housemates" are there. We have chickens, ducks, guineas, cows, goats and rabbits (one of our rabbits is an indoor "house" bunny) and our labs have always gotten along well with them, after some initial training.  If you have your heart set on a purebred please don't buy it at a pet store. The vast majority of dogs from pet stores come from puppy mills.  Contact independent breeders in your area and go to the facilities to make sure they are a clean and reputable breeder. You may even be able to find a good "rescue" dog...but sometimes they have problems you may or may not be willing to work through. Personally, I have only owned lab mixes (usually lab/retriever mix) and everyone we've had has been an outstanding dog.
OxFsslN8aa	Goldens are puppies for at least three years.  My golden was very puppyish until about the age of 7 and then he calmed down.  Channel her energies into obedience training when in the house.  They need a job most of the time.  My golden would calm down if he had a ball to hold in his mouth.  |`|bSIdlwezaa	For immediate calming down, it helps if you stand up and turn your back to the puppy, looking up at the ceiling. Once it realizes that it's not getting your attention, it'll calm down more.<br>  <br>  For the long term, make sure that your schedule has a time daily where your puppy CAN romp and play to his heart's content. For us, this was the local dog park, only three blocks away. For 45 minutes after work, our dog could run around, play with other dogs, jump, whatever. Then when he came home, he was crashed out!! You could make that playtime at home, too -- toss a ball, have him play with toys, etc. A tired puppy is a calm puppy.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	You need to address an issue each time it comes up.  If my puppy has bad behavior, it is my job to correct it, each time it happens, until I win the war.  If your commands are not working, use different commands.  If the puppy jumps, use your command, lift the legs off of you, and dance the puppy backward.  When the puppy sits praise her.  You have to remember to praise when you get the behavior you want.  Spaying a puppy has nothing to do with behavior.  I spayed my girly girls, and it had no effect on their behavior.  I am not sure why your puppy can't play with the kitten.  I had a ferret and she played with my dog.  When the dog got too rough, the ferret would pull his hair.  When the dog did something wrong, he would start crying  so the ferret wouldn't pull his hair.  I think the kitten will smack the puppy in the face and keep her in her place.  You have to correct wrong behavior, so if the puppy is being too rough, you need to step in.  The puppy will learn that the kitten is part of the pack now.  I think  you just have to step in more.  I use different words, sounds, hand signals for each of my dogs, so if a command isn't working, change it.|`|RjUhISEIaa	Our golden was exactly the same at that age. Our answer to getting him to settle down...and stay down when commanded to do such...a spray bottle filled with water. When he wouldn't listen we'd give him a shot of water right between the eyes which he of course did not like and then give the command of "down" sternly. After a couple of these he'd listen but we kept the bottle (then empty) on a table and if he started to act up we'd just grab the bottle, let him see it and he would head to his pillow and down he went...while giving us a really scornful look.<br>  <br>  Same thing with the kitten...spray the dog with the bottle and you'll get the same result.<br>  <br>  The good thing about this is that it beats yelling and while the dog doesn't care for it it is a safe and harmless means of training.
13xTQ5lsaa	No, its basically not true.  All animals (and people) carry germs, but with good husbandry and hygiene, it is very rare for a person with a normal immune system to get sick from them.  I have had pet rats for over 10 years and have never gotten sick from them.<br>  <br>  If you are worried, check the conditions they are living in before you handle them.  Make sure the enclosure looks clean.  The biggest risk you'll have is salmonella - as long as you wash your hands afterwards, you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  If you do not have a healthy immune system - from an organ transplant, HIV, pregnancy, etc., then you should limit your exposure to all animals.<br>  <br>  If you are afraid of them, start out by watching them - not holding them.  If you try holding them right away and freak out - you could end up seriously injuring the animal.  Watch them every chance you get until you can get close to them and watch them without you getting nervous or your heartbeat increasing, etc.  Once you feel you are ready to interact with them, you might actually want to start out with the rats - they are a little more "settled" and "friendly" than the mice.  Next step is to pet them - but not actually hold them, and work your way up to holding them.  To interact with them, it would probably be easier if you found someone who has pet rodents instead of going to a pet store - pet store employees may not be as patient with you as you need!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|El8Vnfucaa	Go to the pet store-- you can't get any of their diseases from the pet store-- and ask to hold one of the mice. or go to a friend's house who has a friend, and hold the mouse until you become comfortable with it. everytime you see one of the mice in your house, think of that mouse|`|jE3cJWGxaa	No, not from a pet store, but if you hold them in the wild, you could get rabies. Mice are good animals, and would never do anything to hurt you. And most mice are more scared of you than you are of them! Sorry, but granny is crazy.|`|0BVewAXKaa	Are you an elephant by any chance?|`|x6a3MLVqaa	certainly not, i should imagine that mice in pet stores will have to of been vaccinated or somehow checked for diseases, i wouldnt recommend touching the ones in your home though. good luck x    |`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	Just get a cat. The pet store mice don't carry as many diseases as the one's running around your house.|`|RjUhISEIaa	from a pet store? no. <br>  <br>  from the ones running around your house? maybe<br>  <br>  go to the pet store and hold them. you'll find out their cute as can be...as long as they are a pet.<br>  <br>  those in the house...get some live traps...catch them...and let them go back outside!
ydshiNrKaa	Sit him down and look him in the eye and tell him.  It's called tough love.|`|t9Fxx75uaa	Do it like I did. I made him a nice plate of steak and my husband and I told him that he was so special that we picked him out of a whole bunch at the foster home.  We told him that we love him very much and that he'd always have a good life and that he could always count on us to protect him.  <br>  He just asked if he'd get more steak once in a while.  I told him yes and he said, "Woof, great"!  He took it wonderfully well, better than we expected.  Now he tells all his friends that he's so special that we picked him out of alot of pups.  <br>  He's a great dog.  Good luck telling yours.  He'll be fine.|`|YoZZDqq9aa	Wait til he's old enough to understand and deal with such a bomb. Then, you're going to have to deal with telling him the truth about his parentage. It's so hard, but it needs to be done. It's only fair.|`|AA10356572	with a smile.. lucky dogs are adopted dogs.|`|nkEEQtmEaa	He doesn't care as long as you keep his water and food bowls filled and tell him what a good boy he is.  Keep him safe and warm and walk him every day, and before you know it, he'll be all grown up and probably find out the truth from some other mutt down the street, who might be his brother :)|`|SwEvO7aUaa	He doesnt have to know as long as you make him or her fell controble and well taken care of im sure youre dog wont care that its adopted as long as there is love around the dog|`|KdzA9e4Oaa	I think it's obvious! He probably looks at you and wonders WTF happened to my parents! |`|C9R7GFCUaa	Don't tell him, wait until he is old enough to ask the question himself. |`|iasOicRjaa	*Woof woof woof woof woof*..."but I love you like my own" :-)|`|AA11991027	let him think what he wants until he is old enough to ask the appropriate questions<br>  <br>  |`|sCECo8aZaa	The same way he tells you he just took a sh*t on the carpet, ya dont ;P |`|94ef238f7854b4c3d9896acaeb2179a1aa	tell him he is special because you hand picked him!|`|xOTSqH8Zaa	Why would you tell him hes adopted?|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Hold him in your lap and break it to him a gentle, "Woof".|`|3GAiVmEAaa	Don't, it will just hurt him that his real mommie is that hussy poodle down the street, and you don't even know which of her boyfriends his dad is!
