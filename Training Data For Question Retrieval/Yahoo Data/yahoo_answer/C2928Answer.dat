UtHnh0aHaa	It is not a good idea to try handmade soap as shampoo. Natural soap is glycerol that comes from a reaction of a strong base, such as lye (sodium hydroxide) reacting with a vegetable or mineral oil in a process called saponification. Glycerol is an astringent (drying agent) that will remove most of the moisture from your hair making it dry and brittle. It it also very hard to rinse free of the hair because of it's high surface tension and strong bond to the natural oils in your hair.<br>  <br>  A shampoo bar actually contains emollients (moisturizers) and surfactants (detergents to clean)  that will prevent your hair from losing its natural moisture.|`|pvKF1rnKaa	yes. no.|`|dWp6KzM2aa	im sure u can use it but i think that i wont work very well ..... well not as good as shampoo that is
XK9RLaPeaa	I have read and watched many things that say the world is going to end in 2012. Nostradamus predicted it, as he has predicted many events before. Also the ancient Mayans calendar ends on Dec. 21 2012. I try not to believe it... but it is still scarry. It makes you question what you are doing with your life. All I can say is if your religious, you better have things settled before then. <br>  Who knows really though. It could be like Y2K... we all know how that turned out :)<br>  Just enjoy life, it could be our time before then.|`|5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	Not at all!

The mayans didn't predict this, its just their long count calendar is supposed to end. our calendar ends all the time and were fine.

Allow that temperature to stray outside what is tolerable for the environment and watch our economy suffer. Too many people fail to understand that the environment is linked directly to the economy. If you don't believe this, just watch when the next major hurricane hits the gulf coast again and see what happens to gas prices. This scenario of course is just the obvious one. How would the global economy react to category 4 hurricane making a direct hit on Manhattan or Tokyo? How would the economy react to an extended major drought across that North American or European grain belts. How would the global economy react to a crash in the Plankton population, the bottom link of the oceanic food chain, our food chain.<br>  Our economy depends on a healthy environment.|`|AsKWImpQaa	There is, of course, no "ideal average global temperature."

The acid rain was and still is killing trees in parts of the world.    Look at Cleopatra's needle in London (of all places).   It lasted a thousand years in the Egyptian desert in perfect shape.    When taken to London's polluted environment it began to erode quickly.     <br>    The hole is still there, but we cannot fill it back in again- nature will repair itself slowly now that we are no longer breaking it down so quickly.<br>     Global cooling was a couple of scientists who said if nothing else were affecting climate then the aerosols blocking the light coming in would cool the world off.    There were other factors affecting the climate so it didn't happen.    Just because you aren't affected directly by something doesn't mean it isn't or hasn't happened.|`|npBCankMaa	old fashion, climate change is a sexier slogan<br>  <br>  Dr Demming says, "Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the work force asking for zero defects and new levels of productivity.

4Lqp4tgOaa	From Polystyrene beads.<br>  <br>  Invented by Dow more than 50 years ago and identified worldwide by the distinctive Blue** color, STYROFOAM* products are the most widely recognized brand in insulation today.  In the early 1900s, The Dow Chemical Company invented a process for extruding polystyrene to achieve a closed cell foam that resists moisture. Recognizing its superior insulating properties, buoyancy and "unsinkability," it was originally adopted in 1942 by the Coast Guard for use in a six-man life raft. That was the start of many other wartime applications by the Coast Guard and Navy. <br>  <br>  Today, the Dow STYROFOAM brand includes a variety of building materials (including insulated sheathing and housewrap), pipe insulation and floral and craft products.  But there isn’t a coffee cup, cooler or packaging material in the world made from STYROFOAM.<br>  <br>  These common disposable items are typically white in color and are made of expanded polystyrene beads.  They do not provide the insulating value, compressive strength or moisture resistance properties of STYROFOAM products.  In order to protect the Dow trademarked name “STYROFOAM”, such other material should be referred to by the generic term “foam.”<br>  <br>  Check sources for further information.<br>  <br>  Sources: <br>  <a href="http://www.dow.com/styrofoam/what.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dow.com/styrofoam/what.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blpolystyrene.htm" rel="nofollow">http://inventors.about.com/library/inven...</a><br>  Polystyrene: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystyrene" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystyrene</a>
4Lqp4tgOaa	Agricultural Revolution, term applied to a period of agricultural change held to be of particular significance, and usually referring to increases in the output and productivity of English agriculture in the period between 1750 and 1850, although at least five periods of “agricultural revolution” have been identified in England between 1560 and 1850. While there is some agreement among historians that an agricultural revolution involves technological change of some kind, there is no consensus about what the significant changes are, or when they took place. Despite this uncertainty, the issues involved in the debate about agricultural change remain of central importance to understanding the development of both English agriculture and the English economy in the three-and-a-half centuries from 1500 to 1850.............<br>  <br>  For more information, read: <a href="http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761579911/Agricultural_Revolution.html" rel="nofollow">http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_7...</a>

8664f0915b647a021c850b3c103f4307aa	The smaller the watershed the quicker it is to respond to and recover from rainfall.|`|jCI5skEWaa	An amazing simple yet complex question you have delivered.  The answer is they may react exacly the same, the small may react quicker, or the larger may react quicker.  It all depends on the systems within the watershed.<br>  <br>  You have to look at the soil types, stream segments, rainfall concentrations, baseflow characteristics, land uses, geology, geography, storm characteristics, and all the other factors that make up the systems.<br>  <br>  If all things are held equal.  The time of concentration of the rainfall will be less in the smaller watershed and therfore the peak of the hydrograph at the outfall of the watershed will happen sooner, most likely with a higher peak than the larger watershed (this depends on the routing of the streams within the watershed).  The hydrograph of larger watershed will be more expanded with a lower peak that will occur at a time after to smaller watershed.

TkOi7ij9aa	no defino tu dibujo pero creo que lo que vistes fue lo que se le llama tambien HALO buscalo en el search en la web y fotos y veras lo que te digo.Un halo es un efecto óptico causado por partículas de hielo que refractan la luz haciendo un espectro de colores alrededor de la luna o el sol.<br>  <br>  El radio generalmente es de 22o, aunque también se suelen dar casos de 46o, por lo general hacia adentro tienden a tener colores rojizos mientras que hacia afuera cuentan con amarillo, verde y azul claro.<br>  <br>  Dentro del halo, el cielo parece ser más oscuro que fuera de él. Los halos son anillos de color blanco o de una tonalidad pálida que se forman alrededor del Sol o de la Luna. En este caso el mecanismo físico que los produce tiene que ver con procesos de reflexión y refracción en los peque?os cristales de hielo que constituyen las nubes altas de tipo cirros. El tipo más común es el generado por procesos de refracción en cristales de hielo hexagonales. En este caso el diámetro del círculo que forma el halo es tal, que si uno apunta con un brazo en la dirección del Sol (o de la Luna) y con el otro en la dirección de cualquier punto del halo, el ángulo entre los brazos es 22°.La humedad, además de otros factores por causa del magnetismo terrestre tiende a transformarse en neblina que luego, al intervenir otras variables, puede transformar cristales de hielo que dispersan de los rayos luminosos, dando origen a los halos luminosos, ya sea de origen lunar, solar o por luz artificial.|`|1VMaLJJbaa	No hagas caso a los que se rien de tu pregunta, analizá esta assci.

4Lqp4tgOaa	1. Plants (Primary Producers) produce say 100 parts of energy.<br>  2. Herbivores (Primary Consumers) consume 100 parts of energy, but only 10 parts of the energy stored, other 90 parts are spent in respiration, metabolism, foraging, sleeping, procreation and other activities.<br>  3. Carnivores (Secondary Consumers) consume 10 parts of stored energy through herbivores, but only 1 part of the energy stored, other 9 parts (90% of energy) is spent in respiration, metabolism, foraging, sleeping, moving, procreation and other activities.<br>  <br>  At each trophic level (Primary Producers, Primary Consumers, Secondary Consumers, Tertiary Consumers), <br>  1. Net production is only a fraction of gross production because the organisms must expend energy to stay alive. Note that the difference between gross and net production is greater for animals than for the producers - reflecting their greater activity. <br>  2. Much of the energy stored in net production was lost to the system by (a) decay and (b) being carried downstream<br>  3. Note the substantial losses in net production as energy passes from one trophic level to the next. <br>  4. The ratio of net production at one level to net production at the next higher level is called the conversion efficiency. Here it varied from <br>  (a) 17% from producers to primary consumers (1478/8833) to <br>  (b) 4.5% from primary to secondary consumers (67/1478). <br>  5.

The hybrid car shuts off the engine at a stop light, that save flue, you can do that with a regular too.  The hybrid has regenerative brakes that recovery the energy normally wasted by heating up the brake drums/disks and that recovered energy is recycled.  The biggest energy savings, therefore more mpg, is that the engine and car will hardly go 80 mph, put 5 people with luggage in it and the top speed is 65 or 70, at that will take 10 miles of open road to achieve.<br>  <br>  Finally, the hybrids also use exotic alloys to make them weigh less which saves fuel along with being very aerodynamic (which is why they just look stupid).  The use of alloys to make it lighter is because they have to pack around the batteries and electric motor, which NEVER runs and the batteries are never used if you are driving on an interstate at 60 MPH.  The whole added weight and stuff is why a Yaris BEATS the Pius on MPG on the hiway.<br>  <br>  Summary, a hybrid in the city is OK, on the road or if you need more room, then get a regular engine arrangement.  |`|pyyohMEZaa	I would only agree with your statement in that we need to move away from the idea of private transport and fully adopt public transport.<br>  <br>  Public transport can be very efficient both in terms of cost and environmental impact.  Yet we all want to keep driving our cars.  I guess there is nothing like being stuck in traffic for hours every day to give you that true sense of personal freedom that only the automobile allows.|`|2m5IlRXKaa	yer the oil companies have known how to make these sorts of cars for YEARS  and YEARS. the only reason they're so pricey is because of, guess who....... the fricken oil companies. they pay the car companies to push up the price.|`|C99a4jUraa	you could run overe kids|`|bdpmYIgaaa	It appears you are not open to answers that challenge your preconceived notions.<br>  <br>  You are correct that a cheap smaller car is a good choice and may, depending on your situation, be a better choice for your wallet, even in the long run. Toyota in general has very high reliability ratings (except the Tundra), so the Corolla would be a good choice, although it's smaller than the Prius with fewer features and not a good comparison.<br>  <br>  However, nickel used in batteries is very minor - much, much more nickel is used every day for chrome and stainless steel.  If it was such a problem, we'd have developed standards for disposing of stainless steel and chrome bumpers long ago.  Open-pit mining has been done for decades for the steel that goes into each car, that far outweighs the mining costs for the small amount of nickel used.  (NiMH batteries are much safer in use and disposal than LEAD-ACID batteries - think about it!)<br>  <br>  The additional energy costs are factored into the price of the vehicle (they have to be, or the manufacturer would lose money).  You make that up in a couple years of driving and after that you're dollars ahead.  Add in the high resale value and it's a very smart choice.<br>  <br>  I get 49 mpg in my Prius and I don't have an optimal commute. It's not true that they only have a benefit if driven in stop-and-go, actually their best mileage can be obtained using pulse-and-glide technique between 30 and 40 mph, where some people get over 100mpg on a stock Prius, and I've gotten 75mpg for some trips, I've also gotten 55 mpg going 60-70 mph on the interstate due to the efficient better-sized engine for cruising and the aerodynamics.<br>  <br>  The battery is much like the automatic transmission in terms of cost and frequency of repair.  Most cars will go their entire life on the original battery pack.|`|PBk0MZRTaa	You raised a good point, but still I think hybrid cars are the best option. I dint know about Prius. But Honda's Civic gives you 30% more mileage than the normal Civic. Using solar panel wont be a good idea, as you don't get the colour option. And you are not gonna drive it only in DAY. To talk about Electric Cars they are still in developing stage, and simultaneously you can't take those cars for a long drive. Using public transport in the city like Mumbai is the worst idea, Because you hardly get enough space to stand. If you have good options as for public transport then its the best. And as you said about non-warranty battery problem, Scientists are working on it to give you more efficient lithium-ion batteries.|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	Sorry but you're wrong.<br>  <br>  Your question basically says "I think this and I think that".  You provide no evidence to support your thoughts, and rarely even any reason why you think them.<br>  <br>  The only 2 arguments you make are related to cost and not environmental impact.<br>  <br>  Finally in the additional details you raise one environmental point - a myth about the impact of battery manufacturing.  It's debunked here:<br>  <a href="http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/article-417227/Toyota-factory.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/artic...</a><br>  <br>  Fact is that cars consume 80-90% of their lifetime energy during the operational stage, while you're driving them.  Just 5-10% is consumed during construction and disposal.  For proof, see pages 4-5 here:<br>  <a href="http://www.pacinst.org/topics/integrity_of_science/case_studies/hummer_vs_prius.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.pacinst.org/topics/integrity_...</a><br>  <br>  Therefore, whichever car is the most fuel efficient will be the most environmentally friendly, barring some huge environmental impact not accounted for (like if the battery manufacturing really did harm the environment - but as noted, it doesn't).<br>  <br>  Thus hybrids, which are on the order of 30% more fuel efficient than non-hybrids, are greener.  That doesn't mean they're the best thing that has ever happened to the environment, but they are an improvement.
