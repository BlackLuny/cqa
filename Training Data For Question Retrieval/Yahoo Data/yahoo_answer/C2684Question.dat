20090223074843AAhMnWf	Pets;Horses	Please say a prayer for an old gal named Mae?	Mae, an older grey mare is passing on today. She is one of my best friends horses and has been around with us for a while. Everyone who knew her was very attached and love her to pieces. My friends dad is taking her up to the mountains today to put her down and let her go in a place that she has dreamed about for years. She had really bad arthritus in almost every joint and did not have the ability anymore to get up on her own when she layed down. It is her time to go and God is going to take care of her now in the big, green, sunny meadows up in the mountains where they will be together finally. She is going to be much happier and we will miss her with all of our heart and she will forever stay in our memory.    Please say a prayer for her Mae and think about her today. We are having a very hard time, this is quite emotional for everyone.

20090223075835AAFSfJ2	Pets;Cats	Cat Not Using Her Litter Box?	We have a 2 and a half year old cat who suddenly stopped using her litter box.        First time was a couple weeks ago.  we were out of town for the weekend.  We had a friend stop over on Sat afternoon and check in.  When we came home Sunday there was one poop and 3 pees on the rug near our front door.      Second time was this morning.  My wife cleaned the carpets with a cleaner last night and there was poop on the bottom of the steps this morning.      I am afraid this is going to become a problem and if so I will get rid of the cat.  I will not live in a house where a cat thinks this is ok behavior.  My wife will hear nothing of that so it is causing a stressful home to say the least.  How can we prevent this and be assured it will not happen again?
20090223075440AAY1iOJ	Pets;Dogs	I think my dog has a.d.d.?	I need some advice as to how to cut down on the time I spend taking my dog outside.  She is about 2 yrs old, indoors all the time,  very intelligent and never has accidents indoors.  The problem is- when I take her outside to go potty, even if i know she has to go really bad (like if I have been gone all day) and we get outside she is so distracted by lawn mowers, squirrels, anything moving or loud basically.  She will stare at it and pull at it and there is no getting her to go potty while the distraction is present.  For example- took her out this morning at 10am.  She last went out at midnight last night.  I know she has to go.  We went out, she was dragging her leash around while I was pouring my coffee because she was in a rush.  We got outside and a neighbor across the fence was using a leaf blower.  I gave her plenty of time to go but she only wanted to stare at the leaf blower.  She will stare at the distractions for as long as we let her without dragging her in.  Any advice how to keep a dog focused on going potty when you live in a busy city with lots of distractions?
20090223075420AAIW77X	Pets;Cats	Anyone have stinky litterbox advice?	I have to use Swheat Scoop because it's the only litter safe for both my bunny and 2 cats.  Unfortunately it does not come in a scented version.  Prior to the bunny's arrival, I liked Tidy Cats Scoop but the Bunny will get sick from clay litter.  I also prefer a clumping litter which is hard to find in anything but clay, so thats why Swheat scoop works.  I scoop the litterbox at least 2 times a day, and thats only because I am at home all the time right now (underemployed) but thats going to hopefully change soon.  I can't imagine how bad it would get if I only scoop once a day or something!  I already tried adding baking soda to the Swheat Scoop litter but it doesn't seem to help at all.  Any other ideas that are kitty AND bunny safe?  P.S. Air freshener doesn't even begin to cover up the stench!

20090223080050AASuaWy	Pets;Dogs	What is your opinion about vaccinations for dogs?	Our pup is almost 8 weeks old, but we're very hesitant to get ALL the shots exactly as recommend and as often as recommended. I have several issues and would like to get your opinions:      1. Why must they get shots every year? Shouldn't the vaccines (like human ones) confer immunity for a longer period of time than that?      2. Why do they have to get them so young? Don't they still have some useful antibodies from their mother? Aren't their immune systems still developing?      3. Isn't it better to raise a healthy dog so that his own immune system will naturally respond to infection, rather than relying on shots for immunity?

Surely this cannot be true. right?  I mean actresses that work with Peta would not use it right? I am afraid to google because I cannot bear to see some of the images that may pop up.

20090223081828AAVW6bG	Pets;Rodents	Do gerbils prefer sand, wood chips, or bedding?	with sand I've been told to add a little over 1/3 of the tank full and then add some (really expensive) rabbit hay over the top to give them something to cuddle into. with wood chips, well all I've heard about those is that they control odor but the gerbils dont actually like it. with bedding i've been told it's easier for them to mate and that they prefer it.   I like to spoil my pets (even the small ones) so which do they ACTUALLY like the most?    i know that certain types of gerbils live in different places and that some live in the desert and others live in large, wooded, brushy areas. so all of these types of bedding would make sense.

I had been keeping her cage clean, feeding her the fortefied diet food, changing her water daily, and making sure she is in a comfortable environment.      Well, this past Saturday night, she was playing; I had even taken her out of the cage and she seemed fine, chirping like usual.  Came the next day, she was in a position with her head turned to the left side as if she was sleeping, or sleepy.  She just seemed like she were tired.  A few hours later, she had passed on.      I'm just curious as to what could have caused this.    Like I mention, she showed no warning signs; it was just sudden and a quick illness it seemed.        Does anyone know if this sounds familiar to a cockatiel illness?      Please, serious answers only.  Not looking for any jokesters making fun out of my pet dying.

I am not sure what this means, i have left the moist hide like it is for now, which is not  moist and full of sand. I have a pair of geckos,definitely male and female but we were told that they were unlikely to breed, because they have been a pair all their lives, they are around 5 years of age, and when we bought them we were told that they were sub adults, but in fact they were at least 4, which we didn't realize until after wards. The geckos are not interested in each other what so ever, and i have never seen ANY interaction between both of them, this is why i doubt she is pregnant, but what does the moist hide full of sand mean? I have looked at her and she doesn't look pregnant, well from what i can see anyway. Do i need to buy an incubator?    Thanks if you can help!!   X

She has been skittish around humans but has been coming around. My problem now is that her potty training doesn't seem to be working. We have her in the crate at nights and during the day while we are at work. She doesn't go potty in there (she has had 1 accident). When she is out of the crate we have her "ring the bell" (so far, it's been us asking then taking her paw and ringing it for her) and then taking her outside. We praise her when she goes "potty" or "poop-poops" but it takes her an hour or more to go sometimes. After awhile we bring her inside and she goes inside (carpet, couch, our bed, floor, etc....). I don't really know what else we can do to have her let us know when she needs to go out and why she doesn't do it outside 30% of the time and waits for inside.       We also have a 2 1/2 year old male Cav who is completely trained.       Thanks!

He went thru this, "lets pee and poo behind the couch" that last few days. He isn't my favorite cat honestly and he is my husbands cat but he is hardly home.        There is the older man who is 10 years old, the middle one who is around 1 yr and then there is the baby who is 8 months old.       So I was wondering..do you think my middle cat is actually running around here like a middle child...complaining of not enough attention from us?       Do cats act like this?
20090223085808AA2EugI	Pets;Reptiles	Should I sell my snake?	I am considering selling my pet corn snake, i've had her for about 5 years, and although she was a novel and interesting pet for a few years, she has recently just become a chore (feeding and cleaning out). And i'm not really enjoying having her as a pet, wondering whether to sell her or whether i'll regret it.
20090223091023AACrKGC	Pets;Cats	Will being cross-eyed have any long term effects on my cat?	My two year old cat is crossed-eyed, almost as though one of his eyes is very lazy and moves slower than the other. Will this have any longer term effect on his health? I know there probably silly to worry about him going blind, but is there a higher risk because of his eye-sight problems?      Thanks!
20090223093614AA9kDtt	Pets;Dogs	I am thinking its my fault growing up that my parents sent away my dog.....is it?	This was 13 years ago but I was looking through old pictures.         He had siezures and he did some not so nice things but I'm starting to think its my fault.      First I will list the things he did  and then I will list why I think he did them:         things he did in the 3 years we had him:      he went after two of my friends...bit one. Got into a fight with an american bulldog and a golden retriever. Tried to attack my 2 male cousins from inside the cage....actually flipped the cage down the stairs from the inside. And before the end of things turned on my mom.      All the while never harming or attempting to harm myself or my sister.         Here is WHY I think he did it:      I was always getting yelled at for not cleaning my room right and for leaving a mess.....and I was a kid so there was a lot of yelling. He didn't like my Dad because my dad was always yelling      One day I back talked at my mom (this was the day) and she spanked me and that is when he turned on her and went at her. He didn't bite her but he showed his teeth and growled at her until she stepped away from me      He was protecting me. When he bit my friend it was when she pushed me down. We had an arguement. And he bit her leg.      her mom didn't press charges....he didn't even break the skin and she knew how much that dog meant to me. And she still let her daughter come over. (As long as Pongo was crated)      Once again he was defending me. I'm certain he never would have hurt me and I feel its my fault he did those things.      The dogs he went after came into our yard while I was on the swingset....one dog charged for me and I managed to get up to the top (it had a fort on it) and Pongo chased them both off. With the help of my dad.      As far as my cousins they were rowdy boys who always were pulling on his tail and ears and throwing things at him and me.      All those things involved me. He was protecting me. So its my fault they got rid of him.         I'm trying to let go but I know its my fault. If he wasn't constantly defending me.       I mean other than the siezure disorder and the abuse before we got him that has to be it right....so its my fault.      I mean we got him when he was 7 months old and he started to get this way by age 2.      I just want to let go but I feel its my fault.....I know its sad because here I am 13 years later still dealing with this (my current dog is ill so I'm having a hard time all around)
20090223085905AAqOHGS	Pets;Dogs	I am just going to take the dog out for a walk?	to fulfil his natural functions, i always take a bag to pick up the nasties, i caught someone allowing her dog  to do it in my garden and objected, and she told me she would tell him not to do it there again and was extremely objectionable, what do you think of people like that, or do you think i am wrong

20090223091134AAUVSsL	Pets;Cats	Help! My cat is wheezing, coughing and sticking out his tounge on and off, going to vet at 5 PM but...?	I already asked this question but in a dif way and desperate for answers befor 5 PM!  My cats both have been displaying cold symptoms on and off for the past 3 months.  They both have been sneezing or coughing at the very most 5 TIMES A DAY.  Theres no nasal or eye discharge, I thought maybe it was just an allergy or something.  But now one of my cats is also straining to breathe and acting like a cat with asthma (I looked at some youtube videos).  He doesn't seem quite as bad though, he just hunches over, closes his eyes, and sticks out his tounge and makes a wheezing sounds for about 30 seconds then he acts fine. I'm not sure if thats serious but it looks a little scary.  He also grunts a little especially when hes sleeping which I never noticed before.  I am underemployed and I am not able to pay beyond what is absolutely necessary to help him.  What should I allow the vet to do and what is unnecesary?  Such as XRays, antibiotics, breathing treatment, asthma meds, what does it sound like my kitties have?  And what is the normal treatment for a cat thats wheezing?
20090223093657AADQdFl	Pets;Cats	Should I report this person?	I adopted a kitty today from a supposed rescue. I found him on pet finder, and just fell in love. I had to fill out this very extensive application, so I thought they were very particular about their cats. So, I go to meet him today at his foster moms house. The stench of cat urine hit me at the front door. This was a very small house. She had over 30 cats in small cages. I noticed that my kitty had something going on with his eyes, but I didnt say anything because there was no way I would have left him there in those conditions. He smells horrible, just like a litter box. His eyes look horrible this evening, and he acts like he has never eaten! I wonder if the organization knows what kind of conditions these cats are in? He is going to my vet first thing in the morning, poor thing!

20090223091842AAGCJ01	Pets;Dogs	Should this be required reading?	to all those who "got no $$$s for vet", "can't take this dog no more", "keep them outside", ......."wanna breed their tecups"...etc, etc?...simply those not giving a flying fvck about their dogs :   C&P (unknow source) :   A man and his dog were walking along a road. The man was enjoying the scenery, when it suddenly occurred to him that he was dead.      He remembered dying, and that the dog walking beside him had been dead for years. He wondered where the road was leading them.      After a while, they came to a high, white stone wall along one side of the road. It looked like fine marble. At the top of a long hill, it was broken by a tall arch that glowed in the sunlight.      When he was standing before it he saw a magnificent gate in the arch that looked like mother-of-pearl, and the street that led to the gate looked like pure gold. He and the dog walked toward the gate, and as he got closer, he saw a man at a desk to one side.      When he was close enough, he called out, "Excuse me, where are we?"      "This is Heaven, sir," the man answered.      "Wow! Would you happen to have some water?" the man asked.      "Of course, sir. Come right in, and I'll have some ice water brought right up."      The man gestured, and the gate began to open.      "Can my friend," gesturing toward his dog, "come in, too?" the traveler asked.      "I'm sorry, sir, but we don't accept pets."      The man thought a moment and then turned back toward the road and continued the way he had been going with his dog.      After another long walk, and at the top of another long hill, he came to a dirt road leading through a farm gate that looked as if it had never been closed. There was no fence.      As he approached the gate, he saw a man inside, leaning against a tree and reading a book.      "Excuse me!" he called to the man. "Do you have any water?"      "Yeah, sure, there's a pump over there, come on in."      "How about my friend here?" the traveler gestured to the dog.      "There should be a bowl by the pump."      They went through the gate, and sure enough, there was an old-fashioned hand pump with a bowl beside it.      The traveler filled the water bowl and took a long drink himself, then he gave some to the dog.      When they were full, he and the dog walked back toward the man who was standing by the tree.      "What do you call this place?" the traveler asked.      "This is Heaven," he answered.      "Well, that's confusing," the traveler said. "The man down the road said that was Heaven, too."      "Oh, you mean the place with the gold street and pearly gates? Nope.      That's hell."      "Doesn't it make you mad for them to use your name like that?"      "No, we're just happy that they screen out the folks who would leave their best friends behind."

20090223085813AAM1ivM	Pets;Dogs	My chihuahua is acting so weird, HELP?!?!?!?	So I have a chihuahua, I got her about 2 months ago. She is two years old and not neutered. I got her from my dad's boss because she is going through a divorce and she has no time for her, so she gave her to me. She took about week to get adjusted to her new home, and she has been very active and spry until about a week ago. Last night my mom could not find her anywhere, which is weird because she is always wanting attention. When someone knocks or opens the front door she always runs up barking and wagging her tail. My mom got scared and called me, so I came home and called for her (she responds to me more than anyone in my house), but i got no response. We ended up finding her under my parents bed, with her small stuffed animal cow. When I finally coaxed her to come out she was sad and mopey. When I was about to go to bed, (she sleeps with me) She started to cry and whine and so I went and got her stuffed animal cow and brought it back to my room. I placed it on my floor and then she went and got it and jumped on my bed and slept with it. Now i just got home and she wont even come out of her box. Her cow is right with her and whenI take it away, she freaks out. She is not eating like she normally does, or drinking water. I am really scared and I am not sure what to do. My mom thinks its just a phase but I am scared for her. She has really gotten strangley attached to this stuffed animal and takes it with her everywhere, and now is frequently going under my parents bed... This may be important, she used to hump her cow but was never this attached. Anyone know what to do, or has the same problem?

20090223085753AAFWB8l	Pets;Other - Pets	Hey, someone help me... I need an idea for a familiar!?	Okay... scene from the ground up. I am writing a comic book, and I would like some suggestions on a familiar for the 2 main characters. The characters are:   1. An anthro fox. His fur is a golden yellow, he wears khakis and a black shirt. Persona-wise, he is benevolent and sometimes goofy, basically the ideal good-guy.   2. An anthro wolf. His fur is grey and does not change color, save a black stripe under his muzzle, which fades out on his neck. He wears black faded jeans, a grey jacket, and a white shirt. Oh, and he has half yin-yan earrings, one of them the yin, the other yan. Persona-wise, he is the opposite of the above, though not totally evil. In a word, he's emo.      Both characters are novice alchemists and swordsmen. They are also rivals, for the time being. I need some lesser (quadraped, preferrably furry) familiars for them, to teach them more advanced techniques. What species would be an ideal familiar?

His appetite is fine and he doesn't have any hair loss or blood. It looks fungal but I read that yellow crusting is a sign of scabies. Could this be scabies even if he doesn't have any other symptoms (no red pustules, no larvae)?

20090223095011AAS9fXF	Pets;Dogs	My 3 yr. old boxer may have Cushing's disease. I need a moral booster.?	My dogs been loosing her hair pretty symmetrically for the last two months.  She eats okay, doesn't drink or eat more.  Is still active (will jump on the sofa and in the car with no help) and seems pretty much like a normal dog except for her hair loss.  She's not as hyper as when she was a puppy, but I can't say she's lethargic.  I took her to the vet who tested her for Hypothyroidism which came back within normal limits.  On Thursday she will undergo a cortisol test to see if she has Cushing's.  I just read that the lifespan of a dog that has been diagnosed with the disease is two years.  Is this true?  My dog is only 3 yrs old.  And by many standards doesn't fit the stereo-typical bill for Cushing's. (I have been told that dogs can get it at any age and that it is fairly common).  I feel she is too young to be euthanized and doesn't show enough discomfort to warrant it.  Does anybody know how I can keep the standard of living up for my dog with Cushing's?

I believe she is a tortie - is this correct?  I've also heard someone call her a blue cream so I'm confused.  Her picture can be found here  http://www.flickr.com/photos/35495153@N0...       Also, does anyone know of a website that has pictures posted of what ragdolls look like one they have fully matured?  I know she won't have her full color until she's 2-3 years old but I kind of wanted an idea of what she will look like.      PS - she's just a pet.  I have no plans to breed her or anything I'm just wondering what her color is.      Thanks!      Amber

Well, in the past I haven't had a problem,when I've locked it they haven't gotten out, unless a window was open. However, on the first night, I had locked it to be fully locked, and in the morning the flap was on the outside of both rotary lock pieces, so they couldnt get back in.    So last night, I locked it to in only, and I also placed a quite heavy rock in the tunnel, so not even I could push it open.   however, they still had disappeared!   I think one of my family might be letting them out....   or is it the cats?

Hi ,   my mum has two dogs (boy girl) basically girl got pregnant had two pups my mum gave me one  (i'm 15 by the way,s till live at home obv.)   but it died at 8 hours old i was obv. devastated   so my mum gave me the other pup, she is now 2 years old (3 on the 13th july)   she really is my pride and joy, it sounds silly becasue she is just a dog but i really do love her to bits, her breed is a chihuahua and she is the sweetest dog i'v ever known she is VERY attatched to me in fact i'm the only person she really listens to, and when i'm not there she pines for me for a while until she gets used to me not being there, then she waits for me to get home from school.   having her is a great joy to me and she is a very big part of my life, i LOVE taking her for walks that last all day over the parc and when i take her her off the lead she never leaves my side, i can't explain how much of a devoted dog she is!   but her is the problem my mum doesn't like her!   she says having three dogs is TOO much for her to handle being in the house, so she decided to make the utility room 'the dog room' so basiically they live in that room with all thier food,beds,everything. we still let them out to go to the toilet every 30-45 mins for 10 mins at a time.   and i spend as much time as i can with her in the garden (between school freinds and coursework)   but my mum still says she hates the dog, as my mums dog (my dogs mum) keeps on fighting with each other and growling at my dog every time she walks past her bed, then she comes out of her bed and they start fighting.   this had been going on for quite a while, and now my dad says one of them has to go and as we've had the mu for longer they are looking towards getting rid of my dog.   obv. i'm protesting and have been for a long while, which is the only reason why she is still here.   but now my mum keeps on trying to tempt me with getting another pet at every chance she can (like, rabbits, more hamsters, birds and even snakes) in exchange for my dog.   i would never trade her, but they are really trying to change my mind about it    can anyone out there help me??? what can i do ???   all she has ever known is her life now and he thought of her going somewhere else and never seeing her again makes me cry!!!   please help me!!   xxx

We found a dead squirrel in the neighbors yard last week then yesterday in our back yard and now another one in our back yard. We had this squirrel that came around that we named Thumper because she/he looked like a bunny. It had its tail cut off and moved like a little rabbit. I started thinking I haven't seen her/him around, wait I haven't seen any squirrels around. I know we haven't put anything out unsafe for animals so what could it be? I heard about this new coco mulch that Hershey put out, could it be that? Some may think I'm being silly but I'm just heart sick and I want this to stop. I'm starting to worry about my dogs now too, is someone trying to poison them? Is there some sort of disease that's going around that anyone has heard of?

20090223084345AA8bUmQ	Pets;Cats	Cat making strange coughing, wheezing sounds with tounge out?	So I am supposed to be leaving for vacation in a couple hours but it looks like I am going to have to delay.  I'm gonna start from the beginning...3 months ago I took my cat to the humane society to get spayed.  Within a week she was displaying a few symptoms of a cold or URI, just a little sneezing/coughing (like maybe 3 coughs or sneezes a day).  Soon after, my other cat started showing the same symptoms.  It never got too bad, and eventually seemed to go away after maybe 3 weeks.  Now here we are a couple months later and its like they are doing the same thing again.  And the worst part is my other cat is wheezing and coughing with his tounge out, but then he acts fine.  Also I noticed when he wakes up one of his eyes shuts almost all the way for a minute but then opens normally and its not normal for him.  My female cat is sneezing or coughing a tiny bit, like maybe a couple times a day at most.  I am going to take my wheezing cat to the vet and I know they are going to want to run a bunch of tests and such but I cannot afford a huuuuuge vet bill.  I only want to do what is necessary.  Does anyone have an idea of what this could be, a cold like disease that comes and goes with minor symptoms?  I feel like its not asthma alone, if at all, because they are both a little sick otherwise.  What should I do?

When I started secondary school, one of my friends moved to Ireland; she's come back to London now and has started at my school.   The other week I invited her up my house, and my mum called up that dinner was ready.   The cat was sitting at the top of the stairs, and as our staircase is narrow, I gave the cat a little nudge to make him run down to get out of the way.   Now there have been rumours going around the school that I beat my cats and that I throw them down the stairs!   I've never been one to blend in with the crowds, but all the people I thought were my friends have gone against me and started bullying me.

20090223081436AAk12Bd	Pets;Fish	How long before I can add fish... see details...?	Today is Monday, last tuesday I went to my LFS to buy some long fin Rosy Barbs, my plan was to buy 3, wait for the ammonia & ph levels to even out from adding fish, and go back in a week to buy 3 more. I told the guy I wanted one male & 2 females because I knew having more males would cause them to be more aggressive. The guy put 2 males & 1 female in the bag because he liked the color of the males better, and told me it would be fine, a little aggressiveness would benefit them because they are with 8 tiger barbs. Against my better judgment I went ahead & got them, I like the color of the males better too, but now my girl is in desperate need of some backup. I went back to the LFS today, and every fish in their tank has some funky white stuff on them, it made my skin crawl. I've seen ich, and this put ich to shame. The white stuff was huge!!! and it was in almost every tank, along with signs all over that the fish were 'a little under the weather.' I inspected the tank that my barbs came from and there was very little, if any sign of disease, so I'm hoping the fish I bought last week will be Ok. How long should I wait to be sure? I don't want to add more fish until I know for certain they will be safe, but the boys are wearing my girl out!

20090223081946AArKWDu	Pets;Dogs	Worms, diahrea, other dogs?	Alright, I have a couple questions....      I just got a 5 week old puppy whose mother had stopped feeding it. I am wondering - since she's not receiving the necessary nutrients from her mother, is there "puppy formula" that I can feed her?      Also, I just read up on worms and I found out that most puppies are BORN with worms and need to be DEWORMED. New information for me! The girl who gave me the puppy had bought some deworming meds from walmart. Is this sufficient? Is it contagious? Can my other dog catch it?      And - she has diahrea....is this normal for a puppy who isn't eating whole dry food yet?

P.S this dog has had all his shots.

I believe she is a tortie - is this correct? I've also heard someone call her a blue cream so I'm confused. Her picture can be found here  http://www.flickr.com/photos/35495153@N0...            Also, does anyone know of a website that has pictures posted of what ragdolls look like one they have fully matured? I know she won't have her full color until she's 2-3 years old but I kind of wanted an idea of what she will look like.      PS - she's just a pet. I have no plans to breed her or anything I'm just wondering what her color is.      Thanks!      Amber

20090223100040AAvIzB4	Pets;Cats	Should I feel guilty giving my cat away?	We have had the cat for 6 years and had her since she was 6 months.  She is declawed, clean and doesn't shed. She does bite occasionally and smack you when you walk buy.  She has started biting more since we had a baby. My son is twenty-two months and on occassion the cat will walk up to him and bite him. when he sleeps the cat goes to the crib and scratches against it waking him up. If I shut any doors, the cat will eat the carpet and get very stressed. WE always keep doors open.   The baby does not bother her at all. In fact you can tell from the baby's face that he knows she will bite him. She will rub against him, when he tries to let the cat sniff his hands she chomps on it. He cries.      Someone at work wants the cat. She had a cat die. I explained how the cat is, and my coworker says she is used to a fiesty cat and wants a cat to love. She has another cat (my cat does get along with others) Should I feel guilty giving her away? I feel awful

20090223100535AA63ye5	Pets;Dogs	Dog's constantly leaking anal glands?	My dog developed anal gland issues last summer. Out of nowhere she would leave the smelly brown oil where she was sitting or laying. It has gotten worse and she developed an infection in one. We went to the vet and she prescribed antibiotics to clear the infection up (which it did) and she also expressed the glands which were full.      The thing is, here glands started leaking again the very next day. They have continued to leak every day even after the infection has gone away. I have tried to express them externally, but have had no success. I'm not against learning the internal method (YUCK!) because I want her to be healthy.      Here is my question: has anybody had a dog whose glands need to be emptied every day or so? She has relativity firm poos and I see the oil dripping out when she goes, so I know they are working OK, but I think they are working too much.      Thanks!

20090223083513AA5okdq	Pets;Fish	I need information on breeding my betta fish.?	I have done m homework and gethered information on breeding bettas. I tried to on Suday and I don't know whether it worked or not. Here's what happened:   For simplicity, my male is Spike and my female in Julia.   I cleaned Spike's bowl on Saturday and only partially cleaned Julia''s water so that I wouldn't make her lose her eggs (can this happen?). I fed them sun-dried shrimps to boost their nutrition and to stimulate Spike to build a bubblenest. He did. By the time I put Julia in with him, it was approximately 3/4 of an inch wide at its thickest and about a millimeter high at it's tallest. I have them in gallon bowls and the nest went almost halfway around. When I put Julia in, it took a minute for Spike to notice her. He approached her to see what she was. When she turned around, he fled. She soon became interested in him and began to follow him around the bowl with her gills flared. He was swimming away very fast, but Julia was casually swimming after him. Every now and then she would go over and inspect the bubble nest. This pattern continued for around ten minutes. Eventually, Spike let Julia close to him. A few times later, she rubbed her tail against his posterior end, but he didn't respond. Two times later, he did.  I thought I saw him squeeze her like he was supposed to, but before I could be sure, he began seriously attacking her. I took her out then and put her back in her bowl. She had lost around two scales at this point. I thought I saw Spike putting things in his bubble nest, so I assumed they were eggs. But, where Ihad thought Julia was slimmer, closer inspection revealed that she wasn't. So I put her back in Spike's bowl. She began tearing about, trashing the bubblenest almost. Spike had worked really hard to repair it in the 30-minute interval. It was easily douoble the original size .I took her out again. Spike looked devastated. This morning, the bubble nest had shrunk down to half its size.      My questions are-    1) Did I destroy the fry?   2) Was there fry in the first place?   3) Did I take Julia out too soon?

I'm just curious to see how many people say animal testing is:      a) Wrong   b) Okay sometimes   c) Right all the Time      Can you please state why you have chosen the answer as well.      Personally I think animal testing is so very wrong, because the animals have different cells and genes to us, so the vaccination may not apply to certain animals. It also causes unnecessary pain and suffering to each animal. Also, it has NOTHING to do with them, so why should they have to suffer for our problems?       No hate mail, please.

Would the tendency to aggression and being territorial be more likely because it wasn't done sooner?  I have a male who was neutered a day before his 1 st b-day, and he is extremely territorial and aggressive with our other cat.  Is it best to alter kittens much earlier to avoid this?  Or is it his tempermant?  He is a rather grumpy British Shorthair (except when it comes to food! lol)  and even as a baby, he hated being held and detested our other cat.  The only thing I noticed after being altered was he stopped meowing and he seemed more calm.  Now he's terrorizing our sweet Russian Blue, pulling chunks of fur out and scratching his face (and it bleeds).  I have to keep them separated unless supervised.  What do you think? Thanks! :)

At the petstore they told me he was older than the standard weaning time, and when I asked "so about 6 weeks then?", they said yes definetly. however, I did some more research when I got home and since he has his adult plumage he is at least 6 -9 months old. He doesnt eat anything except the millet seeds. He doesnt seem to understand the other seeds in his cage are for eating. He also doesn't understand that fresh fruit and vegetables are for eating either and I think he has never eaten anything except millet seeds that I have to offer him before he eats. What should I do? Should I grill the petstore for tricking me, should I return him?

I called the vet that we've been taking him to for all his shots and check ups.   They charge $190.  Which includes the pain meds, antibiotic, blood work, and extra charge if they need to take some of his baby teeth out.   I looked online and found a low cost place that charges $74 and it includes the pain meds and antibiotic.  I took one of my cats there once and he was fine.      Which would you take your pet to?   On one hand I want to take him to our regular vet, because they've been caring for him all along.  I know they will take good care of him.   The low cost places just always seem like a butcher shop, they just want to get the animals in and out.  Although the price is a lot nicer on the pocket.   Thanks for the input

I never feed the strays or have any contact with them, (I've noticed about 4 of them), any one have any idea why they would be hanging around my house? I live in a well populated neighborhood.

20090223104145AAYhO6m	Pets;Dogs	How did you deal with missing your dogs when you went to college? (and vice versa)?	I'm going to college this coming fall, and I don't know how I'm going to deal with missing my 2 dogs, especially my male dog, Bailey. (Zoe we just got a week ago so I think i can deal, but Bailey and me are very close) I mean, I miss him terribly if i don't see him for a week, how am i going to deal in college?      At the same time, I am my dogs favorite, and he is attached to me. When I am away overnight, or on vacation, he wanders around the house all the time moping and looking for me, especially before bedtime since he sleeps in my bed. (This is what my family tells me happens when I am away for a couple of days, when they are home.)   How do I help my dog get used to me going away for college, and me not being home every day?      Thank you!
20090223102913AApyAqY	Pets;Dogs	How do dogs handle the KONG toys?	I've posted a few questions pertaining to my dog's separation anxiety.  He's a 60lb shepherd retreiver mix that gets a bit worked up when we leave, and likes to bark.  So among a boatload of other things, I tried the KONG.        I know my parent's lab hated it, but they only put that stupid ziggy stick in it that seemed of no interest to any of the dogs I've seen.  I stumbled over an article that showed all the other cool goodies and ways to stuff a kong, and I have two questions.      One...I need an IRRESISTABLE recipe to put in one of these.  Peanut butter is ok, and will keep him busy for a while.  That kong stuffin' is like all fat, and will give him a heart attack if I stuff it full of that. With that in mind, that leads me to my second question...      Two, dogs chew these things right?  My dog just licks and licks and licks like crazy through the big hole in the bottom.  I thought dogs chew the smaller end and the goodies squeeze out the other end like toothpaste.  So either my dog won't chew it, or the stuff isn't irrisistable enough.      SO all that said, what should I stuff this baby with that will either make him chew it, or will be good enough if he refuses to chew and just wants to lick?

20090223063435AAIRtMz	Pets;Cats	Our new cat seems to have 2 owners. What should we no next?	A persian cat was wandering around our property for two months before we decided she was ours.  She was pregnant and then suddenly she was not pregnant and her teats were dried up.  We supposed her kittens were born and died.  She was famished and we finally decided to start feeding her.  Due to allergies, she has remained an outside cat for the last month that we have owned her.  We chose not to comb her or wash her right away.  She had cuts that we wanted to heal before we messed with her fur. She did not even want to wear a collar, so we kept it off her.  She stayed on our covered deck and was fairly warm, so we did not want to bother her too much.  Our plan was to get her shots and spaying done in March.  Well, she went on her nightly walk and did not come back the next morning.  She came back the morning after with a flea collar on.  The vet told us that flea collars were not as good as the drops and so we took the flea collar off.  I went ahead and combed her fur and washed and dried her. Then I put her regular collar on and attached a note saying nicely that we did not want to double her up on pet care and for them to please call us so that we could talk about her care.  Then we let her roam again last night. She came back this morning with no collar and yet they haven't called.  I tried to get some more mats from her fur, but she cried; she is still tender.  I sent her out with another note tied to a ribbon.  What would you do next?

They also get timothy hay, a couple carrots or apple slices,  a salt spool or mineral spool, and as much fresh water as they need. In the summer time they also get about 10- 20 min every other day on fresh grass.They have their own cages but they are outside but they have a open part that is fenced  and a large inside box that is made out of wood so they can get out of the weather. Their cages are cleaned every 3 days and I use hay in the winter time for bedding and aspen chips in the summer. They also have a small fan and masquito net in the summer. They are held daily. Is this good living condition for them? Are they taken care of ok? Thanks

20090223110238AAzFg84	Pets;Cats	How can I get my cat to stop fighting with the other cats in the neighborhood?	Recently I moved with my two outdoor cats, one of wich is not spayed, at this point it's a bit late for that and besides he's not a permiscuous  cat, he's more of a community cat whereas he enjoys being part of a pride rather than being a mate, I know this because I have observed him in my previous location where he seldom fought with the other cats, this is probably partly because he was born in the house where I used to live and he grew into the area.  Where I am at now I have let him go out to become aquainted with the area and surroundings, however it seems that every other time that he has been going out since moving here he has come home with viscious scratches around his head and I end up having the detain him in the house until he heals and that's not a good situation either because the soreness of the bite holes he's sustaining makes him angry and only want to go out to fight even more amd carries on endlessly howling to go out to win his fight.      To remedy this, I thought that I might spray him with cologne or perfume to keep the other cats at bay but that would only confuse and disorient him.  Or I thought about buying him a spiked collar but then that might be even worse if the other cats bite around it they might take his ear off or an eye out.      I know that everyone is going to say to have him spayed, but I don't feel that I should mutilate him because he's having a tough time finding his way with the other cats around my area.  There has to be a remedy or some sort of solution to help aquaint him with the other cats so that he doesn't fight.      Does anyone know what I could do?      Supported and educated answers with get the best score.      Thank you.

20090223110739AAzOPoC	Pets;Dogs	My dog is starting to annoy me.?	So our dog is a year old. He's a male and he's a black lab. He ALWAYS has to follow us around. I didn't mind it at first, I actually thought it was pretty cute, but lately it's getting out of control! For example, when I go to the bathroom, he has to be there with me, and he has to have his head on my lap! I know you are going to say well just shut the door and keep him out. I try that! I try to sneek in the bathroom and quick shut the door, but dog is huge and strong and just pushes me out of the way! He HAS to be where we are! I don't mind it when I'm sleeping. He will lay right by the side of the bed or right by the door. It makes me feel very safe. During the day when we are home, he is right at our feet. He always has to have his head in our lap, and sometimes he thinks HE needs to be in our lap. It's okay when I'm just watching tv or something, but when i'm doing school work or reading or on the computer, its pretty hard to do! I know i know, train my dog, yea were working on that, hes just hard headed and doesnt listen! We'll give him a treat for sitting away from us (as in NOT right in my lap, but by my feet) but its just not working.       He gets plenty of attention, probably more than a lot of dogs. I know he just loves us and wants to be with us, but it's starting to get to me! I can't do anything without have a huge dog under my feet! I don't want to step on him or end up dumping something on him when i'm cooking and turn around and trip over him.       We're trying to train him. He's a lab, and they hit that stage of not listening or anything, and it's hard to do. (we've had him a month) Anyway I can get him to stop?      Oh, and a crate doesnt work. He HATES crates. He just freaks out and yelps. he can move the crate across the room when he is in it by hitting up against the side. Baby gates dont work either, he can jump them. He can break them. We've gone through 3! AND if we shut the door on him, it gets extremely scratched and beat up.

He heard on the radio that the pads have an ingredient in them that is also in antifreeze. A couple had called in to the radio station and said that they used them, their dog walked on the floor, licked its paws, and got sick. They took the dog to the vet and it had to be put to sleep, all b/c it was poisoned by the ingredients in the pads.

20090223110740AAr1Wts	Pets;Fish	Super high Nitrates and algae problems..?	I haven't been in my roommates room for quite awhile, i guess i just assumed she was doing water changes on her fish tanks while i wasn't home or something,  But of course she just wasn't doing them at all, She told me yesterday that shes been having a lot of problems with algae, she has some kind os long stringy algae that reaches clear across her 30gallon tank. and she also has what im guessing is green dust algae, green dust looking algae that wont rub off the glass.  So i went in and tested her water, Ammonia and nitrites are zero, but the nitrates was off the chart. i mean usually the test turns a little orange in my tanks, but hers was dark red.  I did partial water changes on both tanks, 5gallons out of the 30gallon tank, and about 2.5 gallons out of the 10 gallon tank.  The nitrates are still high in both tanks, but lower than they were at least.  How long should i wait before doing another water change? Im not sure what would be worse for the fish, the high nitrate levels or doing too big of a water change.  Do you think the green dust algae in the 10 gallon tank will go away when the nitrates are under control?

Her mother was full blooded wolf and her dad was full blooded english mastiff.  she is right around a year old and looks just like a wolf only a bit bigger.  the people that had her kept her in a cage by her self with little to no human interaction.  Her personality is very dog like she is the sweetest thing. but she is as stubborn as a wolf. she had never been on a leash before or even a collar on.  when we take her for  a walk if we are in woods that have other dog fecal matter she will go but if we walk her where we live and she wants to go somewhere and we wont let her she will lay down and wont move let me tell ya... it kills your back when you have to keep picking up a 70lbs animal that is just dead weight in your arms...plus she will hold it till we are inside. if there is anything you can let me know that will help with getting her to go outside other than the woods it would be nice. also anything else would be nice.  we would like to train her to go places with us... hiking, wondering through wilderness kind of things i would greatly appreciate it. please only people who have been around wolf dogs.  thank you

20090223111439AAhjeoD	Pets;Cats	My two cats of 10 years have become mortal enemies, what's going on?	Hello,   My two cats, both indoor male cats one is 10 and one is 11 and who have always gotten along great, have decided within the past month that they hate each others guts.  My husband and I went away one weekend, as we frequently do, and one of the cats has become very mean.  The two cat's personalities are as follows:      Logan:  the alpha cat although never the aggressor.  He can easily dominate the other cat but usually let's the other cat "win" in their mock battles.  During their previous battles Logan was always the one who came away with the scabs,mostly on the back of his neck, but still would never go on the attack against the other cat.      Snowflake:  very needy and clingy.  Would frequently attack Logan but in what I always thought was more of a fun way than a mean way.        When we returned home after a weekend away every time Logan came near Snowflake, Snowflake would begin to hiss and growl and back himself into a corner.  I took him to the vet to be sure he wasn't sick and he checked out fine.  Throughout the past month they've gone through periods of snuggling and sleeping together and then back to enemies.  Although Snowflake is obviously afraid of Logan ( backing himself into corners) he is the one doing the attacking.  What I have observed is that Snowflake will attack Logan from behind and Logan, unlike previously, will attack back.  My theory is that Logan just got sick of Snowflake's attacks and put his foot down.  Today they battled and now Snowflake has a pretty significant rip in his ear.  Until this new behavior pattern I never once found a scab or cut on Snowflake, only on Logan.        My questions:      1.  Should I have Snowflake's ear checked out?  It's not ripped all the way through but it's probably an inch long flap of skin cut off.      2.  Has anyone had a similar experience with two long time cats and how did you resolve it?  They were on valium for a little while per the vet but other than making them groggy it didn't seem to help because they would already go through periods of getting along, cleaning each other, etc.

20090223111828AAts4VD	Pets;Dogs	Can your dog be snatched away by creditors after filing bankruptcy protection?	i was having lot of financial trouble lately because for many months I could not find any job despite trying very hard. I graduated from college last year in may 2008 with bachelor of science in math. However being out of work for over I could no longer keep up with credit card debt.       I was not even able to find any $8 an hour position. i was badly out of luck this time.  I filed bankruptcy protection last week because i had about $40,000 credit card debt which was largely the result of having no health insurance and being diagnosed with a gastro-intestinal sickness that has no cure.       The bankruptcy lawyer said that i have to list all my assets and some of them maybe taken by creditors. He said the dog may also be considered an asset if it has a market value.       So i want to know if i will lose my 2 year old male sheepdog mix because of bankruptcy.

I have been told that a martingale helps with this but what is the difference between a Running and German martingale?   What does each one help with. There has to be a reason there are two different kinds.

My betta fish is 7 months old and I have had him for a month and just recently he's started puffing up and attacking the glass and being all around stupid. I personally would rather he not kill himself by attacking the glass, so does anyone know what the heck is going on?
