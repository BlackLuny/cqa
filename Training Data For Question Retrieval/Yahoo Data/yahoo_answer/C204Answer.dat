euFDn0FBaa	I don't really like Heather..|`|AA11138222	Love them, love them, love them!!!<br>  <br>  My name is Heather, so of course I like that name :) and Emily is a great name to go with it. I like that they don't sound too similar or start with the same letter. Twin names that are "matchy" make me nuts!<br>  <br>  The only problem I have with Heather is that there are no nicknames for it (except maybe Heath (pronounced like the first half of Heather) but it looks like it's pronounced He-th (like the candy bar). I hated the fact that I couldn't shorten my name growing up so I have vowed to give my children names that have nicknames associated with them.|`|YldfngvAaa	Heather is pretty and not used very often these days.

hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Savanna,<br>  <br>  Surrendering a child for adoption does not mean that a mother shouldn't have subsequent children. There are lots of biological families who are separated for reasons other than adoption too but separation does not mean that a family stops existing or growing. It means that there are more people to love one another when reunions happen.<br>  <br>  I had two kids for friends who couldn't and then had two boys which I am raising. I have no secrets about their siblings from them and they are FULLY aware of them and the circumstances surrounding the situation.<br>  <br>  Yes, it is hard - there are sometimes questions and discussions that aren't exactly comfortable for me, but I refuse to be dishonest or lie to them and that truthfulness has contributed to the quality of our relationships. Yes, there are lots of reminders - but there is also joy and love in sharing those moments with my children. Yes, I am worried about how their sibs will feel - but I am trying to prepare as much as I can. (Their adoptions were supposed to be open but the APs refuse to honor their promises.) My raised children are happy and healthy and are the light of my life. They are worth so much more than the uncomfortable questions and the sometimes wistful moments - especially when they throw their arms around my neck and tell me how much they love me and their family...|`|NoUkTQCgaa	My first Mom had my brother when I was 14 months old. It was a bit shocking to find out, but not nearly as much as it shocked him.  <br>  It bothered me to some degree, like, "Umm, ok, you gave me up, yet married my father before my adoption was even final and had another baby 14 months later...wtf!" BUT- there's nothing I can do about it. I am very happy to have siblings, though. We are so much alike, its scary, even though we were seperated by 2000 miles and 42 years.<br>   <br>  I actually think it affects him more. He only found out about me about 6 months ago. He said had he known about me his whole life, he would not have been so hurt, or confused. He said he now looks at his childhood differently...every picture differently, every experience differently.  <br>   <br>  He said he now looks at his baby pictures and wonders if our Mother was thinking of me when she was holding him. He said he doesn't think he would have done that had he known the truth about me his whole life. Its all so messed up.  <br>   <br>  Once my siblings knew about me, they said that our Mother's behavior/parenting style made sense.<br>   <br>  I think it is important for first Moms to be open about this. Most adoptees search...so the secret will most likely come out. <br>   <br>  ***ETA***** I think I would have been less upset had there been more time between me and my brother.   <br>   <br>  As a few other adoptees have said, it's a jealousy thing. Looking at their pictures, thinking, "I should be there..."  <br>   <br>  Unfortunately, my first Mom was not truthful with me (I found her when I was 21) and told me my brother was several YEARS younger than me, so when I found out it really threw me for a loop. I think she knew it would hurt me. Im NOT making excuses for her, though.  <br>   <br>  I will be honest, I was surprised at my reaction when I met my siblings and heard stories about how they grew up, and saw pictures of my family. I was jealous. My adoption was proof that adoption does not guarantee a better life, just a different life. I was not abused or anything, and I had plenty of love, but I was nothing like my a family, and exactly like my n family. <br>   <br>  So, yes, it did sting, but I think it would have stung less had there been a few years under her belt.<br>   <br>  Luckily my N brothers share the same warped sense of humor with me, and said they recognized my handwriting....that I had carved my initials on the inside of her uterus! BWAHAHAHAHAHA! <br>   <br>  No matter how many months or years pass between your children, I think the child who is not there with you should not be kept a secret from the others. <br>   <br>  ***ETA for Mei-Ling*** I was the same. J was born when I was 14 months old. She married my father before my adoption was finalized. She was pregnant again with my brother. I wasn't placed w my a parents until I was 5 1/2 months old, due to 2 different states being involved with my adoption. She had stayed at a maternity home in one state until she was 8 months preggers, then was shipped to another & had me there. The original state claimed me, as they had facilitated the original agreement, but the state in which I was born stepped in and said the state where the child is born trumps all, lol. So I was born, sent to a Catholic Scarities orphanage, then placed with a foster home in the first state, then to another foster home in the state in which I was born until they could duke it out in court. YIKES!! No wonder I looked confused in all my baby pics.|`|7JEojMgQaa	I waited 19 years. Although they love each other the age difference between my kids is huge. I still have two in high school at age 53. <br>  <br>  No it wasn't a daily reminder after all those years, but I did have to wait for that feeling to go away, and it took a long time. I felt as though it would be a betrayal to her for a long time.|`|nESfk0bXaa	Adoptee here.  I would feel jealous--it may not be rational, but there it is.|`|JP04HX6maa	I echo what LinnyG said to some extent.<br>  <br>  I have a sister who was born a mere 14 months after my birth. Not when my adoption was finalized. MY BIRTH. <br>  <br>  What sucks even worse is when I figured out the timeline and then witnessed her type to me "If Mama could have had you, I would not been born."<br>  <br>  That was like a physical blow to the stomach, much worse than anything anyone could have ever said to me regarding her existence.<br>  <br>  Of course by that point I had already figured it out, so that really just confirmed it for me. It hurt like hell when I originally figured it out, though. It was a VERY good thing my mother didn't speak English, and that I couldn't contact her at the time, because I'm quite certain I would have said some really nasty things to her about having my "replacement" sibling.<br>  <br>  Knowing that not only was I relinquished, and THEN another sibling "replaced" me did not do wonders for my self-esteem.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  That said, sometimes I still feel a bit angry and frustrated and cast-out, but I am still very much looking forward to meeting them and trying to get over that issue.<br>  <br>  I don't believe reunion will "fix it." I don't expect to. What I do expect is to create memories that I will cherish and finally hear it from my mother that I am just "as good as" the sibling who was kept.<br>  <br>  ETA: Likely. <br>  <br>  My mother had really wanted to have a female daughter, so when she couldn't keep me, the next possible solution was to have my sister.<br>  <br>  If she had given birth to a boy, I don't know if she would have kept trying. I think it's likely but I'm not entirely certain. It would have hurt regardless of the gender because the whole point was that I felt/feel as though she did it to REPLACE me.<br>  <br>  So yes, absolutely, it would have STILL hurt.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	I would feel jealous.  I was adopted as an infant, and I am not in reunion yet.  It would depend on how long after she had me that she had another child and kept them.  If it was immediately after she had me, I would feel a bit jealous.  Just being honest.  I can't blame her for moving on and starting a family, but I do wish she had room for me instead of giving me up.  I would have questions, but I too have felt the pull towards having a family.  Somewhere out there I might have sisters or brothers.  Somewhere out there, there is a woman who has 5 really awesome grandchildren who she may not even know exist.  I would just be open and honest when you are in reunion.  Tell them why you did what you did.  Foster a good relationship between your children.  Make sure they understand that you did give up another child.  Don't keep secrets.|`|frpCK0utaa	my bio mother had a second child 4 years after i was born. AND my bio father had two children from a previous relationship(although the mom of the two eldest ran off, leaving the boy and taking the girl).<br>  <br>  How do you think i feel? On the one hand, i feel like maybe there was something wrong with me that my mom didnt want me and my twin brother. I felt like my birth didnt mean anything at all.<br>  <br>  But i know that thats not really true. But i cant help the way i felt when i first found out.|`|xKSr1ld8aa	I didn't have more children and my son was upset to find that out - for me as much as him as he would have liked to have siblings.  Well he does have a half brother by his father but my son has been rejected by his father so no contact with brother.  It has been painful overall as his aparents have a son of their own so he knows it's hard for me as I'm the one who didn't raise any children.|`|993127072b7a2a0e8c555efdb241a674aa	as Lori A said, she waited 19 YEARS to have another. my youngest bro is 20 years younger. <br>  <br>  i have never felt betrayed by her because she gave me up. she was a completely different person back then. she was a kid when she had me-and in her 30s when she had my bros. (actually-MY daughter is older than my brothers) <br>  <br>  now if we were close in age or i found out she had a child BEFORE  me that she kept...i think i may have felt pretty bad about myself. i totally understand why people feel that way. seems like it would be a major blow to your self worth.|`|HtiVTA0jaa	Both of my bio-parents have kids now.  My bio-dad has a daughter (10 yrs younger than me).  And he just told me that last he had heard, my bio-mom has 3 kids.  Oddly, hearing about my bio-mom's kids bothered me more than hearing about his.  I don't really know why.  But I have always had more issues with her than with him which is why I chose to meet him first.|`|2B2RVbtCaa	I think if it were several years after I was born or her circumstances changed drastically following my adoption then I would be happy for her.<br>  <br>  I think though that if it was almost immediately after my birth and nothing had changed when she got pregnant again and kept the baby I would be more confused than anything.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	I'd be upset, hurt, and feel abandoned again. As if I wasn't good enough to keep, but my brother or sister was.|`|0x8Q6rFPaa	My mother married and had two children after relinquishing me.  While this does hurt my feelings and make me jealous, I realize it's because I was born out of wedlock and they weren't.  That's how things were done back then.|`|Q49NciNraa	Savannah,<br>  You're starting from a much more conscious place than I did when my second child was born 20+ years ago.  There was an 11 year gap between the daughter I gave to adoption and my son and a lot of unresolved guilt/grief that I pushed into the background as just a vague sense of unworthiness.  Being able to hold and care for my son was actually quite healing for me, although I did deal with a lot of self doubt about whether I was good enough for him.<br>  <br>  The way you are looking ahead may be very helpful for you and your children.  Be as open and honest and present with them as you can.  Look forward to reunion!|`|7228313eb9e24d0f1b9632b4cd051e3aaa	I'm pretty jealous of the fact that my bio fther probably has a family , but in his case my bio mom was an affair he was having, i always feel jealous, but i can see the reasoning.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	I had my daughter in Jan 1972 (I gave her up) and my son in Nov 1977, so almost 6 years difference. <br>  The first year of my sons birth was extremely hard. Everytime I looked at him I thought of her, did she look like him, act like him, cry like him.  It was hard and I barely made it. But then I had to face the facts that he was not her, he was his own little wonderful person and he still is, only 6'4" 260 lbs. <br>  A few years after I reunited with my daughter, she asked, why did I keep him and not her. It was difficult to say that I was married for a few years, had a house and was in a better place. She told me she would never have given up her child and I have had to live with that.<br>  If I hadn't had my son I would have gone insane.<br>  He didn't replace her, she was and has been always in my heart.

Go to the doctor if your worried.|`|cFktUueyaa	These other women are WRONG WRONG WRONG! You can have a period up to 3 months of pregnancy, I did with my first child.

vEv2YwWdaa	You should stop giving your child any liquids right before milk around two years old.  You should start to think about potting training at 2 1/2 and this involves no liquids right before bed.  You do not want ad one more thing (taking away milk a child may be used to) to potty training.  It will be easier for you you in the long run.  Also if you are giving your child milk make sure you are brushing their teeth before bed.  Milk causes rot.|`|uftfUW2Zaa	don't give him milk 3 hours before bed if he is potty trained|`|OeD2sJt7aa	We switched to a bedtime snack before bed and if she asked for milk we told her that we would check on her 1/2 hour after she went to bed and if she still wanted it, she could have it then.

At some point (probably not yet) you will want him to try and stay dry at night, and for the next few years it's not a great idea to give him a drink right before bed.

Until age two it is so important for them to get the fat content in milk for proper brain development. He needs 16-20 ounces of milk a day until age two.|`|XVljoYZ5aa	If he's weaned of the breast/bottle you should aviod drinks right before bed.

NN2ZSwXZaa	As you already know, this is unacceptable behavior. The only advice I have for you would be to remove yourself from the situation. If that is not possible, then be very careful until the opportunity arrives for you (& boyfriend) to get out. (I am assuming that you all live together.) Just remember that if you get caught up in arguments with someone like this, you will not be helping your cause. Good luck!|`|uftfUW2Zaa	No thats NOT right she should not do that! that girl is nuts....|`|1enIWBGnaa	What has this got to do with 'Toddler and Preschooler'???|`|vEv2YwWdaa	She has anger issues.

azE51WGRaa	There have been cases where a non-pregnant women's cervix can be dilated 3cm and she never know it. It could be that your cervix still hasn't completely closed from the D&C (since they had to open it anyways during the procedure). Your body could still be healing from everything that happened a year ago. I had a stillbirth when I was younger and it took me four years to get pregnant with my daughter (and that was using no protection the whole time). I would go to the doctor, explain the situation, and tell him you haven't been able to conceive. He might be able to give you something to help you get pregnant. He also might be able to give you the reason why your cervix isn't closed and whether or not it's affecting your ability to conceive (because most of the answers you'll get on here will be speculation. We're not doctors so we can't really give you the definite reason..but we can give you some possibilities). Best of luck.|`|CFFuFof1aa	How do you know if your cervix is open? It's about 6 inches or more inside of you. I've had two miscarriages in the past 6 months, so I know how you feel. Just make an appointment with your doctor and have him check you out. Good luck.|`|LL2dgYMUaa	i do believe your cervix only closes when you become pregnant have a look on some information sites .|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	ummm....how do u know thats ur cervix that ur feeling?|`|fc3045470b792b9f04d696b7f2f9cd91aa	Are you absolutely sure you know what you're feeling for when you say your cervix is never closed?  If you haven't been to the doctor already for your annual pap, make an appt.  Your doctor will be able to visualize the cervix and make sure everything looks ok.|`|jcXSNjowaa	Well there is always a slight hole in the cervix.<br>  <br>  and if youve had previous pregnancies or have been medically dilated, u can stay open 1 cm or so

Although they could bear significance, so in that case.....|`|YldfngvAaa	Sienna May is definitely the best of the group. <br>  <br>  Teagan is waaaasay too masculine.<br>  Michaela is so trendy and blah. <br>  Naomi is pretty but not as nice as Sienna.<br>  Maxine is terrible. Sounds like a 45 year old in 1983.|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	I have some suggestions for you...<br>  Instead of Teagan, how about Reagan?<br>  Michaela spelled Mikayla.<br>  I don't like Naomi-Ray or Maxine.|`|49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	Sienna May is nice ... stick with it!<br>  <br>  Naomi Ray would be quite nice but as a seperate first and middle name, not a double-barrelled name.<br>  <br>  Teagan ... nooooo!  It was trendy about 12 years ago but just sounds dated now.  Maxine also sounds dated and sounds like it belongs to a 40-year-old.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	I like Sienna May.<br>  <br>  Maxine sounds like and old name to me.<br>  <br>  What about Rebekah Mae? Thats what my youngest daughters called!|`|pFxNunMxaa	Naomi is such a pretty name!<br>  its my favotire <br>  but I really like the nickname Max for a girl so maxine is another good one!<br>  good luck with #7|`|doLyOac0aa	Stick with Sienna May,
vdVVZiY6aa	Gabriel Thomas or Isaiah Thomas, I think Thomas fits nicely!<br>  and Not a Huge fan of any of the girls middle names, but if I had to choose, Louise. Harper just doesn't seem to go with the first and last name to me, and Lou Lopez kinda sounds like a tongue twister.  How about?<br>  Isabela Lucia<br>  Isabela Carmen<br>  Isabela Ana<br>  Just some suggestions, but whatever you like, go with that=]|`|AA11138222	I really like the sound of Gabriel Thomas Lopez.<br>  <br>  For a girl I would go with Harper Isabella Lopez or Harper Isobel Lopez because Harper is a little less common than Isabella.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	My favorites out of your list are --<br>  BOY - Gabriel Isaac<br>  GIRL - Isabella Harper<br>  <br>  Other suggestions:<br>  Carson Alexander<br>  Carson Thomas<br>  Carson Tyler <br>  <br>  Thomas Chandler<br>  Thomas Connor<br>  Thomas Jacob<br>  <br>  Harper Emerson<br>  Harper Ava<br>  Harper Claire|`|1CJggYYLaa	Gabriel Thomas Lopez sounds great!!<br>  <br>  I don't like the Louise or Lou with the Lopez.....so I prefer the Isabella Harper Lopez.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	Gabriel Thomas<br>  Isaiah Thomas<br>  Isabella Harper|`|FvYqKZSMaa	girl-Isabella Harper<br>  <br>  boy-Gabriel Zade|`|9Zjk9dRqaa	BOY- Gabriel Isaac Lopez<br>  Girl- Isabella Harper Lopez|`|65IAbgjfaa	Gabriel Cohen and Gabriel Thomas are absolute winners!

If Thomas is a family name, Then stick with that. Then when he's older his friends can call him Tom. If it's a girl, how about Cathrine or Katie? I'd spell it Katie, but you could spell it Katy or Kati instead. Catherine can be spelled differently too. You could spell it Kathrine or Katherine or maybe Kathryn, all instead of Cathrine. If called Cathrine, her friends could call her Katie when she's older, Just like Thomas and Tom The middle name could be Emily, Or maybe Chloe.<br>  <br>  These are all my personally favorites, and you do not have to use these. I hope all these names help!!!|`|Df8RodwHaa	Girls:<br>  Isabella Victoria<br>  Isabella Alylissa<br>  Isabella Harlow<br>  Boys:<br>  Thomas Isaiah<br>  Thomas Jeramiah<br>  Thomas Micheal|`|LeQiljr7aa	I really like Gabriel Issac and Isabella louise
tQPvv0Glaa	I did a VBAC with my second child after my first was born via emergency c-section.  I was absolutely terrified but wanted to give it a shot because I thought it was the best option.  Everything went wonderfully, and of course the recovery from a vaginal birth was so much easier than the recovery from a c-section.  Having a VBAC was the best decision I could have made.  I think you should go for it.|`|e3fa2fb97cbca43e2c3086607351d4caaa	I'm in the same boat as you....i'm 31 weeks almost 32 and debating if I want to do a VBAC i'm leanin towards a VBAC....Good luck|`|0iUxfCMcaa	my first was an emergency csection but my secound and third where both vbacs. i had no problem whats so ever with either of my vbacs and i recovered alot faster from the vbacs then the csection. im now pregnant again and im going to have hopefully another vbac as long as this one stays head down lol. when you have a vbac doctors monitor you more closely to make sure you dont rupture or nothing while you are in labor. good luck
cAtWxJG1aa	like you.  introverted.  but since having shy kids i've made an effort to force myself out of that somewhat, because i think they need the role modeling.  so much less so than i once was.  i still get antsy if i don't get time to myself in a day, though.|`|4gZYucHMaa	I was introverted as a child, teen and young adult and a homebody<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm still a homebody but I am definately more extroverted, not sure if it's due to kids or just that time in my life where I realized finally who I am, what i want and not to be afraid of other people.|`|j2mRop0laa	May come as a shock but I'm introverted and always have been. <br>  <br>  Mostly because it very annoying for people to talk loudly and repeat things to me, as I'm deaf. Sometimes, I misunderstand and the conversation goes a bit *off*. Most people tend to get annoyed, I assume. So I just don't even try anymore.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I was introverted when i was younger because of my upbringing...but honestly, i'm an extrovert and have been every since i got out of that house! Having kids didn't change it for me, getting out of my mom's house did!|`|lkhCeAdJaa	I am extroverted, (as if you all couldn't tell THAT!) and I always have been.<br>   I am usually the one in the group making everyone else laugh.  my eighth grade principal told my mom I was the "ringleader" an d i should go into politics.;-)|`|AkFag8tNaa	I used to be shy and introverted and while I'm still introverted, I'm much more outgoing,|`|qSmCA82Aaa	Oh I am VERY Extroverted!  Ha ha!  I talk to anyone and everyone ~People probably think i'm strange sometimes, I also smile at everysingle person that walks by me.  Sometimes people smile back sometimes they just look at me weird-hehe!   Oh well you know the saying, something like if you can make even one person smile for the day then you made a difference!  I also like to compliment random people.<br>  <br>  And nope having children hasn't changed me at all!|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I have always been very introvered, at parties I was the girl in the corner just watching every one ( poor self image). Now that i have a daughter im still introverted lol. If anything i think its becuase i had my daughter young and I feel like if anyone finds that out no matter how good of a parents i am ill be judged and im just not up to that. I think if i get in to a good parenting group with her it will improve.|`|uGqYoZNEaa	I was VERY extroverted, as most aquarians are.  Since having kids I think maybe a bit of anxiety crept up.  I think a lot more before saying stuff, don't go out as much, kind of censor myself.  I like wild ppl and having really outgoing friends, but I like quieter ppl, more reserved now around my kids.  It's weird and I honestly struggle with it.  If I let myself 'be me' I notice ppl are like whoa!|`|s4aX6bF6aa	i'm an introvert...i've always been an introvert and i will probably always be an introvert...i have slight agoraphobia and don't like to be around people...even though i do have children and go to school functions...i still tend to keep to myself...my husband on the other hand doesn't know the meaning of the word stranger...he'll strike up a conversation with anyone he meets.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	I have always been able to be very extroverted when in my confort zone, or with people I am confortable with.<br>  Since having Brody, I am completely comfortable with who I am, and I am not the least bit shy anymore, and A LOT less introverted.<br>  Much much more outgoing now.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	I was always very extroverted and kinda blunt to people, always in trouble, cussed every other word.

qpmGLd7laa	Academic: Finish undergraduate school with a GPA of 4.0.  Currently in 2nd semester of 1st year, and so far, so good. :)<br>  <br>  Then, I plan to go to graduate school and specialize in chemical engineering (or something, haven't made up my mind).  Currently majoring in chemistry.<br>  <br>  Career: Make it to the top of whatever field(s) I enter!<br>  <br>  I also plan to study law, psychology, physics, and some other stuff just because it's good to know such things.|`|J3H3C5ksaa	Currently, I don't have academic goals, or career goals.<br>  <br>  I don't  want goals. For career, I have a rough idea what I would enjoy as an occupation, but it's not my goal. Later on, possibly, something else I enjoy more might come along. But if I had just focused on one thing, I might not have been able to see the other opportunity or a better fitting career. When you set goals, you don't see what else is there, you just focus on one thing, and nothing else matters.<br>  <br>  As for academic, I don't have goals either because I am more for living in the moment. "And in the end, it's not the years in your life that count. But the life in your years." [Abraham Lincoln] It's like my motto, I strongly believe in living in the present. Not dwelling on the past, worrying about the future, but just being happy with what is now. <br>  So, say I decide I HAVE TO get an A in Math, but I'm like a C student [example, not true, so, just in case you think I don't have academic goals 'cause I'm stupid or something] then I'd be studying like hell and stressing myself out more than I need to. And I'd just be set up for disappointment when I don't get an A, even though I know it's hardly possible.|`|CWfGCYYTaa	I want to do a medical degree and specialize in respiratory medicine.<br>  <br>  I hope to work in Africa with the UN :)|`|AA11296427	I'm studying Performing Arts & Sound Engineering.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|o8uGsZxmaa	I want to finish school and go to college to be a Nail technician and a hair dresser.<br>  <br>  =D|`|XKYP0sGQaa	Well I am currently working full time as a builder and carpenter which I love and have no intentions of changing. <br>  <br>  Although the next thing on my agenda is to get married and have kids.

Plus, he could have a variety of nicknames too:  Josh, Nate, Nathan.....|`|VGij9p0Taa	Really nice name. <br>  Joshua meaning jehovah saves is a good strong biblical name and the nickname Josh is good too. Nathaniel my favourite bit of the name meaning gift of god is great wholesome name that is slightly less common than Joshua and I prefer to the name. However i'm a little bias as I love the name. Nathaniel Joshua Green would be cool but either way it's a great, strong, masculine name that ages well.

jS10yIEwaa	Start with your adopted parents. If they knew your biological father was looking for you they must have found out somewhere. There are lots of sites to help, most are free. Adoption Registry is a good one but none really helped me find my son, but they have had great success with others. I found my now 28 year old son 1 year ago and he has become my one of my closest friends. We have a great relationship, he sees me as his father but also his friend.Too awesome! Hopefully it will be a rewarding search for you also.  Again start with your parents and get all the details, the agency they used, the dates and places and the names of all those involved. The more information you have the better. Your parents may feel reluctant and a little displaced but assure them you are not trying to replace them or hurt anyone and that you just want to expand the knowledge of who you are not replace it.

IGQvJ6Ujaa	I think that you should use Margaret Louise Walsh. It sounds more the like the Gold Rush time and for a poor girl with a drunken farmer dad.

VBlrL1puaa	No, you are not wrong at all. It wasnt as if she was asking you to pretend you didnt know of her getting a bad grade on a test it was a matter of her life. You did what is best for her, she may not see it now but she will. What does a 25 year old guy want with a 17 year old girl who isnt mature enough to tell her mom about the relationship anyways? Then he wants to run away with her? Thats even more dangerous. Obviously he is not the adult she thinks he is if he is willing to commit crimes with this young girl and leave his life. You did the right thing and your cousin may be mad at you for telling her mom, but she would be even more upset if something happened to her and you were the only one that knew. Dont feel guilty.|`|kRt9Dq7gaa	Good for you.|`|xRcqusUaaa	no u did da right thing|`|yFYFSjwcaa	You tried to cover for her and i hope she didn't know you couldn't do it for ever and you weren't wrong for giving her the number her mom needed know where she was.|`|zATQaiwIaa	No - you are not wrong!

93b6228e5eb9f5e9a8f4e35581b925c5aa	It will really depend on your baby.  It can last any where from a week, to several weeks, as far as the cough/cold part of it.  There shouldn't be a fever anymore, if there is you should let your dr know.  My son is 7 months, about a month ago he had RSV, he was also on a nebulizer.  He was perfectly healthy for about a week but he now has a cold again and is starting to wheeze so I have started him on nebulizer treatments twice a day to help out.  I'd say if you still need to do the nebulizer treatments in another week,  call the dr and have your baby checked out again to make sure it's not progressing into something more serious.|`|LIxpXTnLaa	It honestly depends - it can be different for every child. Mostly brought on by a cold. The nebulizer should be used until his/her breathing is no longer labored or 'raspy'.  In most cases, he/she will need the nebulizer nearly every time a cold is caught until they grow out of it (a year to a few years in most cases).
AiJeS6I1aa	Often, this has to do with reflux (GERD).  Due to the increased pressure in your belly, when you lay down, food/acid washes up in to your esophagus and makes you feel nauseated as it may be rising into your throat.  This is not always painful (heartburn) and may cause nausea.  Yuck!  I feel for you!<br>  <br>  Now, what to do:<br>  <br>  -elevate the head of your mattress... put blocks or textbooks under the headboard legs<br>  <br>  -take an antacid before bed.  Tums are alright, but Gaviscon works better because it creates a bit of a barrier to physically block stomach contents from going back up.<br>  <br>  -Don't eat a large meal right before bed and avoid laying down after a meal.  Better yet, eat more, smaller meals.<br>  <br>  -If all the above fails, tell your doctor and you can get a prescription for ranitidine (Zantac) which is an acid blocker.  This is a safe medication to take during pregnancy.  If you live in Canada, you can get a prescription for diclectin to try and take it just at night... worth a shot... maybe it will help.  This is not available in the US.|`|jcHxLOAXaa	with my first two pregnancies i was always sick during the day, but with my third currently 14 weeks i find i feel lousy at night and suffer with sickness which at the minute i find a blessing as i can get on with my day normally and its not disrupting my first twos daily routine.|`|AA10626836	Oh GEEEZEE YES! im only 6 weeks and i only get sick at night! <br>  It sucks and its hard to go to sleep

FQ4nhSiRaa	I think it is worth it they are testing for uncommon yet serious diseases and conditions. Former Buffalo Bills Quarterback Jim Kelly has made it his lifes work to push for universal newborn screening because if they would have done all those tests at birth on his son Hunter they could have saved him from the awful disease he suffered until his death at age 8. Uncommon, yes, but if your child is the one then you would feel it is necessary.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	For liability reasons they check your child frequently right after birth. If you don't want your baby messed with as much you could either insist on leaving the hospital right after birth, or use a birthing center and again leave right away, or just have a home birth.<br>  <br>  We live in a "cover your ***" society. If you or your child is under a medical professionals care they are going to poke and check them frequently.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	unfortunately, for the best care available, they do need to do tests, immunizations, and exams.....it's temporary discomfort that the baby won't remember and may uncover something that can be important to the child's future well-being and health.....|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	unfortunatly it needs to be done, maybe ask them if they can poke and prod your baby in another room away from you, thats what i plan on doing because im just gonna cry watching them poke my baby and make her bleed and do all those invasive tests =(<br>  <br>  to the guy below me, you know why infiant mortality is down? Becuse we have all these tests to detect disorders and illnesses and if positive can give the proper treatment to save the babies life. Better safe then sorry. Why not put your baby through all those tests to be safe then to not and have some illness missed and your child die? Besideds a few hours after its done the baby wont even remember it.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Well since the US ranks way down with Croatia, Malta, South Korea, and Martinique for infant mortality I would say no.<br>  <br>  I don't know what they were doing to your baby.  But the US is the only, or one of the only countries that does Hep B at birth for all babies (not just at risk babies).<br>  <br>  The hearing test should be done with baby asleep.  Heel pricks are never needed, except for the infant screening for metabolic disorders which isn't supposed to be done until day 3.|`|UJwb4zuraa	well besides the tests and shots they need<br>  its very beneficial for babies to feel something, anything<br>  it helps their sensory nerves develop which will lead to their brain and spinal cord to develop, etc <br>  a chain reaction<br>  they even get volunteers to donate their time at hospitals picking up infants and just rocking them to sleep so that the babies feel their touch.|`|LIxpXTnLaa	No, it's not necessary, but how will you ever tell what they should be doing and not doing? You could go to medical school and learn for yourself, but you'd still have to argue with the morons about whether or not it needs done.<br>  <br>  Pointless question.

rDw9N09iaa	the reason that your doctor said for you not to go is because anything could happen, especially with you being so far in your pregnancy. and you wouldnt be near your doctor/hospital, you would be out on the road. and thats not safe. like, what if you went in labor? they say its a huge risk factor to go traveling within the last 6 weeks of your pregnancy. congrats on the baby!|`|aLAmvX5Naa	9 hours in a car is hard on a pregnant woman. There would be stress on your body and you could end up going into labor on a stretch of country road with no hospital for miles. You never know.<br>  <br>  Your doctor said no, I'd go with no. Your cousin's baby will still be there in a few months, you can take your baby up there to visit this summer.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I wouldn't go hun.. 9 hours is a long time for someone as pregnant as you to sit for one, and you could go into labor away from your doctors for two... wait until you have your baby too and then go.|`|uuHPneEcaa	if ur doctor told u not to go then don't go. I am sure if there wasn't a problem then ur doctor would have said yes. but he said no. so don't go..  i stopped traveling a long time ago. when i was 7 weeks pregnant i went to my cousins house it was a 6 hr drive. after that I said nope not going anywhenre until after I have the baby. and i was still in the beginning stages of my pregnancy. which i had to go to the bathroom and I was hungry a hella lot and its was just horrible.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	your putting yourself and your baby at risk. your also looking at blood clots forming in your legs due to the long periods of time sitting in the same position.|`|PfIywLLyaa	I would listen to your doctor since he is the expert. You will have plenty of time after your baby is born to go visit.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	listen to your doctor...he/she did go to medical school for a reason you know!|`|LUbW8kTBaa	You really shouldn't go because your doctor told you not to.  The only reason you should travel is if it's an emergency.  However, if you do decide to go against doctor's orders, be sure to make very frequent stops to get out and walk around and stir up blood flow.  Otherwise, why don't you and your mom wait until you have your baby and drive there?  That way you can show off your baby too!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	You want to be in a car 18 hours in 3 days?  You're crazy.  And unless you're willing to wear Depends, it's going to take a lot longer than you think because you'll have to stop so often to go to the bathroom.<br>  <br>  Bad choice.  Don't go.  Wait a few weeks, then you can see each other's babies.|`|uGqYoZNEaa	I would not go.  I went on a 7 hour trip at 34 weeks, stopping like twice.  I went into labor like 2 days later and my midwife said that it was too much stress from the drive that could have contributed to it. YOu need rest this far along to be honest.|`|8mchLCQhaa	No I would not go.

Get a life.|`|79LdWKogaa	Let her hit him so he will get the point otherwise hes going to continue to think it is funny.And tell him that is how painfull it is when he gives her a titty twister.|`|NQcHRUbfaa	Since your son has never been hit there obviously, he doesn't know the pain associated with his private parts. Let her do it because your nice approach is not working. He thinks it's funny and I guess thinks she's kidding about it hurting. Plus, she's probably going to start developing soon and you want this to end soon. As soon as possible, I'm sure. Sometimes talking doesn't always work with kids and it takes demonstration.Example: biting from toddler,you bite back softly just to show it can hurt... Let her try see what happens.|`|qjf1BoNIaa	I don't know, that doesn't seem like the right way to go with this. I think your son needs to be punished for his behavior. Two wrongs don't make a right. And they need to stop the horseplay all together. You need to tell your son it is completely unacceptable to touch his sisters privates for any reason and if he does it again he will lose ----- you fill in the blank, TV, DS, Xbox, whatever. Don't be a nice mom. Would you allow a ten year old from down the street to do that or would you flip out? You need to flip out on your son, teach him to be a good man.
MzHwklzKaa	Yeah, get a lawyer.  <br>  <br>  They can file papers that will MAKE her have a DNA test.<br>  <br>  DO NOT GIVE HER ANY MORE MONEY!!!<br>  In some places, giving her money is accepting responsibility for the child REGARDLESS of DNA results.  Bad news!!<br>  She could catch you for a kid that isn't yours if you provide support.<br>  <br>  DO NOT TAKE ANY MORE OF HER CALLS.<br>  If you don't stop contact immediately, she can say that's "Interest" in the child, and a judge can lock you into support despite DNA tests.<br>  <br>  DO NOT SIGN ANYTHING!!<br>  1 signature can make you responsible for this child until it's 18 no matter what the DNA test says.<br>  <br>  DO NOT SAY ANYTHING LIKE "I'LL HELP YOU..." or "IT'LL BE OK..." ETC.<br>  This is a verbal contract and it's BINDING in the eyes of the law.  She can get you to support the baby for 18 years if you tell her you will.  EVEN if it's just to get her off the phone.<br>  <br>  <br>  THIS HAPPENED TO MY BROTHER!<br>  My brother had to fight for a year because he thought he got a girl pregnant, supported her until the baby was born and the test could be done.  Her lawyer said that his "interest" (paying the girl's bills) constituted care and that made my brother responsible for the child.  After a year, a judge threw it out ONLY because he stopped having contact, paying, and talking to her the instant the baby was born and proven not his.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|lfMJPZ67aa	Get your self a lawyer and make her have a test. If the baby is yours then go for full custody of your son. Yes she is crazy and the baby would be far better of with you if it is yours. If she text you or email you keep them for future court battles. Any evidence can help your case. Don't let her disrespect your girl friend stand up to her and tell her to watch her mouth. She has no right and it lets your gf know that you love her.<br>  Good luck.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Ok...first...you need a paternity test.<br>  Second...accept that she has the right to put the child up for adoption, unless you are willing to take him.<br>  <br>  And third, do not get back with this woman.<br>  She is a manipulator---and isn't even embarrassed by her actions.|`|xpUyH0psaa	keep receipts of what you buy for the child, then find a lawyer to get a DNA test before exploring the choices in keeping or adopting the child.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Wow, what an entangled mess!<br>  <br>  The first thing you need to do is establish paternity.  You must find out whether this child is yours or not.  You are saying that you don't think so, but you are giving her money every week.  This may sound harsh, but I would refuse to give her any more money until a paternity test is done.  Are you listed on the birth certificate?  In most (if not all) states, if the parents aren't married, the father must give consent to be on the birth certificate. <br>  <br>  Now, if this child is yours, you do sound willing to support the child.  You really should have some sort of legal agreement for child support.  So yes, I would definitely consult a lawyer.<br>  <br>  As far as adoption (and I would seriously worry about someone using a child and a threat of adoption as emotional blackmail) if you are the father of the child, she cannot place the child for adoption without your consent.  The father has the option of having sole custody of the child.  Now there are ways around this, so again, I would talk to a lawyer.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Chris,<br>  <br>  UGH! I can't stand it when people use children as weapons.<br>  <br>  First off, if you are the father and ESPECIALLY if you have been involved, she CANNOT place the child for adoption without your consent. You do not need to adopt a child that is biologically yours.<br>  <br>  Here is what you need to do:<br>  <br>  Offer to pay for a paternity test. There are even some available OTC that you can do yourself and send off for the results.<br>  <br>  KEEP RECORDS<br>  <br>  Get copies of the birth certificate and any other papers pertaining to your paternity in order and keep them safe.<br>  <br>  Keep copies of EVERYTHING you do for this baby. Records of visits, receipts for purchases and gifts, phone records, etc.<br>  <br>  DO NOT stop supporting the child. If you give money to the mother make sure you have a receipt of some kind. Write a check, give a money order or set up payments through your local CS agency.<br>  <br>  Offer to take custody the child IN WRITING and keep a copy. If possible, file an affidavit of paternity along with a copy of this with your local Court.<br>  <br>  Get in touch with a reputable Father's Rights group like F4J - they can help.<br>  <a href="http://www.f4j.us/" rel="nofollow">http://www.f4j.us/</a><br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about signing a putative father's registry - you've already demonstrated that you claim this child - but it isn't a bad idea to cover all your bases.<br>  <br>  Know the laws in your state - you can find them online. You are your own best advocate.<br>  <br>  If you are having trouble representing yourself pro se then hire an attorney who SPECIALIZES in father's rights or family law for the next best representation.<br>  <br>  Do not let yourself be bullied. It is not good for you or your child.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your child. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fathers4kids.com/html/FathersRights.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fathers4kids.com/html/Fathers...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fathersrights.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fathersrights.org/</a>|`|yDWcYXl5aa	Legal aid and the child support offices might help you.<br>  <br>  See if your state has a putative father registry.  There are laws in many states where a father must put into writing that a child is his, by going to the clerk's office and signing the paperwork.  Since you've been providing financial responsibility, it will help.  In some states, you can lose all your rights if you don't sign the registry in a very short period of time after the baby's birth, so time is of the essence.  <br>  <br>  The next time you hold the baby, and if it takes going to her house, and helping her for a little bit, when she goes to the bathroom, take a clean Q-tip and swab his mouth.  It might cost a little money, but you can have a paternity test done through DNA like this.<br>  <br>  If this child is yours, fight for custody, you don't have to adopt it.  Check your laws, because it might not be legal for you and your girlfriend to live together to adopt.  Child protective services might help you establish paternity.  If the mother is using you, it's wrong, but understand that hormones, and a new baby, topped with financial trouble can wreak havoc on a new mom.  Tell her that you are going to fight for custody, and are placing the money to support the child into an account for him, for the state to know that you're trying to provide financially for him, and that she won't be able to get the money, until you get the paternity test.<br>  <br>  Also, know that kids can favor either parent a lot.  I know full brothers and sisters where the boy is redheaded, short, and chunky, and the sister is dark headed, tall, and slender.  I also know that my adopted son has different parents on each side of his family, however, he looks like his siblings on his dad's and mom's side, even with them having different moms and dads.<br>  <br>  You don't want this woman to place the baby for adoption before you begin something.  With the putative father registry, she might be able to place the baby, but if you show you're trying to be a father before he's placed, you've got a good chance at being a father for him.  I hope your paternity tests come out the way you want them to.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	ok get a lawyer<br>  <br>  get a court order in place to get a dna test done...do not give her another penny if you have thi smuch doubt..you can if you want to.<br>  <br>  if he is yours and she gives him up by law social service will have to have your consent for adoption to take place,,,,get a lawyer to get this sorted out once and for all for the sake of the child|`|6orvPrLLaa	1) she can NOT make an adoption plan without your consent.<br>  2) you need to contact the legal aid office in your county, GET A DNA TEST, and seek custody.<br>  3) don't give money...yet buy what the baby needs (pampers, formula, clothing, et al) and DOCUMENT...DOCUMENT...<br>  4) your ex is a manipulative woman.<br>  5) make better choices with your intimate partners, in the future.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	If the baby is your son, she can't give him up for adoption without you relinquishing your rights to him also. <br>  <br>  I'd get a lawyer and try to take custody of your son.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	You need to get a family lawyer.  Right away.  Tell them the situation, and get it down in legal writing that you are the child's father.  She cannot give up the child without your consent.  You will not have to adopt him to care for him.  This is your child.  Of course, you'll probably need to take a dna test, but if he does end up being yours... you can raise him.  She cannot give him up.  She would be in big time trouble if she did, as it is falsifying legal documents.  <br>  Some states have a registry for father's to sign to prove that they know they are the father of an unborn child.  Try to find out if your state has this.  You can get a restraining order if she continues to cause problems in your life.  The child is most important and deserves to be parented by YOU, not strangers.<br>  Good for you for stepping up and taking the initiative to parent this child.  I wish you the best.|`|AA12127693	If she wants child support then tell her that you want a paternity test - if the child is not yours then you are not responsible to raise this child and she will need to attempt to find the father if she wants to put the child up for adoption.|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	Well first of all, her "not letting you" do a DNA test is crud. She has no choice, especially if you take the issue to court.

I applaud you for giving her money, but only if she is really using it for the baby. If she isnt, dont give her a dime. Get a paternity test done ASAP. She cannot stop you from doing a dna test. AT ALL. If she refuses, or says you are not the father, to child services, there ya go, cut your losses so to speak.

If he is your son then you do have rights in which case make sure you get legal advice.  <br>  <br>  I wish you well and hope you have a positive outcome, good luck!|`|Cwmb0tJJaa	Yes get an attorney and go to court.

What doesnt he do. Anyway he's soon going to realise that his friends get pocket money too, but some of them don't do chores. Hire his money a bit to about $10 he will think, WoW thats a lot more and he will probably do more chores too.|`|Lm0yy1xdaa	I think that his "alowance" is fine enless he goes with his friends alot lets say to the park or something like that an the ice cream man comes he should be fine.And if ur on a budget you could cut it down a littleI say it all depends on where he is and what he likes to buy|`|af4CvnTWaa	Although he may want money, he doesn't really need it for anything. You feed him, clothe him etc, it's only fair he helps a little in return. $2-3 should be plenty for a week's allowance for an 8 year old.|`|6EsIv0vZaa	if $7 sounds good to him that seems fine. but for a while i got $10 a week for just making my bed,cleaning my room and helping with grocericies and things.|`|H16s9PKjaa	Well im 14 and I only get ￡10 a month, however I have found from experience (little sister) that aslong as they have something to save for then it doesnt matter how much you give them (with-in reason)|`|AA10292441	How about a buck a day if he does his chores well without complaining? Seems to me about right for an 8 year old.|`|eOvpsOUaaa	A good allowance for an 8 year old may be 2-5 dollars.|`|qbVLOkwsaa	i thinnk 7.00 $ a week is goodd.|`|ReCh1tCtaa	i would give him $10 a week|`|LLeQyWGcaa	that sounds great. It is nice to know that you are teaching your child responsibility and discipline. Having him know that if he works hard he will get rewarded. You are a fair and responsible parent.|`|UnlaK5WOaa	My mom gave me $20 dollars in two weeks in elementary school, which I wasted on toys and candy.<br>  <br>  It increased to $30 in middle school, which I wasted on random crap I didn't need...and candy. <br>  <br>  In 9th through 10th grade I was still given $30.  I seemed to have matured and bought things I needed for school, used it if I wanted to go out with friends, saved alot to buy stuff like a guitar or iPod instead of asking my parents to buy it, and spent it on candy and junk....just not as much as I used too. (:<br>  <br>  Now the family is going through tough financial situation so I don't get any at all.<br>  <br>  I'm 16 now, but I have to still work to earn my lunch money.  <br>  <br>  I maintain my room, do my own laundry, and do my dishes, mop the floors and clean the kitchen counter.  I have other siblings so they do other jobs.<br>  <br>  Your kid seems to be doing ALOT.  How about giving him $10 dollars every two weeks.  Keep it a steady budget without the whole quarter for a job, when he already has heaps of them.  <br>  <br>  Maybe I feel  It’s too much because I’m used to division of labor.  As he gets older, reward him with more money if he earns it.<br>  <br>  Also have him to buy some of the things he needs so he can become independent and wont have to mooch off of you for a long time.  It also helps him to be resposible later if he manages his money wisely, but he's only 8.  Maybe when he gets to middle school you can help him manage his money smartly.|`|mF0L5jMNaa	Part of his allowance should be "just because".  Not tied to chores.  Chores are part of the priviledge of living with other people in a home/apartment, etc.  Most allowances are $1 per year of age.  Try to get away from paying him for working around the house.  Or else every time you ask him to help out he will say "how much does it pay?"|`|HZKsNwbeaa	No allowance.|`|cztcAOW9aa	WAIT!....WHAT THE?... Im 15 still do all that stuff and i never got payed a damn cent, ah oh well got a job so its cool|`|33e18371c231caed609d57632064134caa	at least $25.00 a week. stuff is high.

Sorry. I think Oliver would be a good substitute for Oscar and maybe Ellie instead of Elsie.|`|tHkhaWsmaa	Pregnant with a Boy is completely correct.  Elsie the Cow and Oscar Meyer wiener.|`|OmJfYPptaa	I like them!|`|75c4fd1f4d2f05c3f64c60714f6b13d8aa	Those are fantastic! We have got a few family names that are timeless classics as well.

Not a good idea for either names!|`|nUac2BmIaa	Elsie is what cows were typically named in the old days... and Oscar makes me think of Oscar the Grouch... I don't think they would be my first choice for names... but Elsa sounds really nice...

After the hottie Hayden Christensen. :D Or Chad. (Murray) Lol.|`|JS3rK9i2aa	I like Oscar for a boy but i think that Melissa or Isabelle for a girl would be much better than Elsie.

Sorry.|`|VEgv5NhSaa	Oscar for a boy :)<br>  Love the name :)|`|AA12050428	Personally I don't like either of them.  Your surname would suit any Christian name.Sometimes a family name or your  maiden name fits in very well.  I think a lot also depends on the country you are in. Here in Sweden I think the Christian names are delightful, Magnus, Bjorn, Kjell, Goran, Sven, Petter, and the girls Kristel, Isabelle, Anna -Lisa. They have a particular pronunciation too which makes them sound so lovely.<br>  Many names from the Bible are lovely too, Naomi and Matthew.  Oh I could go on all night. I'd love to know what you decide.|`|AA11664117	i like them both but i like<br>  aiden more for a boy :D|`|b1znvwnJaa	Hmm... Elsie McMaster ... it doesn't really go, sorry. I think you need a more feminine name... Charlotte McMaster, Isabella McMaster... as for a boy, Oscar is fine =]|`|igvUbqkyaa	I think Oscar is super cute!!! Elsie though I think should be a nickname for Elisabeth (which I LOVE) but not as a full name - it is too childish for an adult.|`|xpstigPTaa	I like Elsie but I definitely do NOT like Oscar. Reminds me of the pig. sorry|`|HOdblqIkaa	I like Elsie for a girl its really cute.

Randolph is not bad either and certainly sounds cool, but I grew up near a Randolph Road and can't get that association out of my head. It also reminds me of Rudolph, as in the red-nosed reindeer. Randall is very masculine sounding and strong to me -- it rolls off the tongue smoothly and sounds very suave.|`|MPVNIqeqaa	Honestly, I don't like either.<br>  But I like Randall better, it sounds more sophiscated and simple.<br>  Randolph reminds me of a mean teacher, or someone that thinks they're better than everyone.|`|9y4mUvaFaa	i so badly wana say randall but im guna go with Randolph because Randall screams Recess u know the kids cartoon and Randall is the snitch!!!|`|2p39nEdHaa	Randall|`|KAj7GfeDaa	Randall|`|bYWPWUE1aa	Randall|`|NTKzocAIaa	Randall caz Randolph reminds me of santa clause|`|3g13ARkbaa	my dad's middle name is randolph and i love it.  he goes by randy.|`|sYUUKa7yaa	randal|`|47M20WOUaa	I like theme both|`|7d7EvX5zaa	neither.<br>  ew<br>  :/|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	Randall, although it reminds me of the evil lizard in Monsters, Inc.

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	That's silly.<br>  <br>  Now you shouldn't *drink* breastmilk if you are lactose intolerant, but adult lactose intolerance is common and completely unrelated to lactose intolerance in babies which is very rare (because until recently a lactose intolerant baby would more than likely die).  In fact lactose intolerance is adults almost universal in some populations, and yet they breastfeed.<br>  <br>  If you were *allergic* to lactose its possible that having it on your skin or in your body would cause an allergic reaction.  But an intolerance is not a true allergy.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/bfinfo/lactose.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/bfinfo/l...</a><br>  Adult lactose intolerance<br>  The lactase enzyme levels normally change over the course of a life span. They rise rapidly in the first week after birth and fall sharply in later childhood, starting to fall from about three to five years of age. The low levels of the enzyme present in the first week of life are matched by low levels of lactose in colostrum. Cows' milk is commonly consumed by adults in some populations, but these consist of people of mostly northern European descent. In about 70% of the people of the world, and about 10% of Australians, levels of this enzyme fall so low in adulthood that these people are lactose intolerant. The tendency to adult lactose intolerance is genetically determined. Some races, such as Asian, African, Australian Aboriginal and Hispanic populations have a greater tendency to adult lactose intolerance. Caucasians are more likely to be able to consume milk as adults because they tend to continue to produce the lactase enzyme throughout life. Even so, the levels do fall with age and people who have been able to drink milk as adults may find they become lactose intolerant when elderly. An adult who has very low levels of the enzyme can usually tolerate some lactose because normal bacteria living in the gut provide a limited capacity to handle it. However, the person may find it tends to give them loose stools and 'wind'.<br>  <br>   <br>  All human races' babies can tolerate lactose. In fact human milk has a very high concentration of lactose compared to cows' milk and that of other mammals. This is thought to be related to a human baby's rapid brain growth in infancy, compared to other mammals. Removing lactose from any baby's diet for more than a short period should not be done lightly, and only under medical supervision.|`|f4HsyUfQaa	I have celiac disease. Im allergic to dairy, soy, corn, avocadoes, bananas, tree nuts, and a few other things. you can breast feed, just don't ingest lactose or dairy while your breast feeding. Supplement with vitamins, and other calcium/vitamin d rich foods.|`|xGedX2rIaa	if you were fine with your first, i wouldnt worry. Anyway, you can always start and if theres a problem swap. But always try to give it a go.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	Thats ridiculous of course you can.|`|nxEoR9CEaa	Ask your doctor, I am sure he/she can tell you.  I wouldn't guess that it would affect the baby in any adverse way.|`|zSEJC6vZaa	I'm guessing that you don't have congenital intolerance because you were only diagnosed last year.   You're probably like most people who are lactose intolerant in that you have gradually lost the amount of lactase in your gut(the enzyme that breaks down lactose and makes it digestible).  <br>  <br>  Congenital intolerance, on the other hand, is where you lack the gene to make the enzyme in the first place.  If this was the case, it would have been evident from birth.<br>  <br>  I would go ahead and breastfeed since the chance of your baby having congenital intolerance is rare and the benefits of breastfeeding far outweigh the very slight risk that your baby is lactose intolerant.  However, I'd just make sure to mention it to your pediatrician so s/he is aware and can tell you how to watch for symptoms.|`|CFFuFof1aa	They just said that because it means that the baby has a higher probability of being lactose intolerant as well. I would still breastfeed. You have been diagnosed as lactose intolerant, not the baby.|`|jgVC15QMaa	Hey just go and see your Doctor ok he can tell you more .But i see No Reason why it would : if i was you i would go and see my doctor and take the Book that you have and see if the Doctor thank so .hope you fine your answer.|`|6VR19YQWaa	Of course you can. I am sure when you were diagnosed they gave you ideas of what you should eat and drink to make up those nutrients. Eat lots of those things and stay healthy and your milk will do the rest!|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	What reason did the book give for this?  I would see no reason why a lactose intolerant mother couldn't breastfeed her baby.

Your bum is the most padded place on you and at 7 weeks that baby is well protected in there. :) I was like 12 or 13 weeks and fell (tripped over stupid dog) and I was fine although I did go to the Dr. to be sure. If you are really truly scared go to the Dr. They are used to easing new mom's fears and better safe than sorry.|`|azE51WGRaa	Your baby is really well protected in your womb, so as long as you didn't fall on your stomach and you're not having any bleeding or pains, you should be fine.

If you start having pains or any bleeding, then go to the dr. immediately.|`|C3PbHd2Haa	No0o0o ii think its ok. there was no bleeding or anything.<br>  if your really worried darlyn go 2 the doctor 2 put your mind at ease. x|`|yzakyjNKaa	i wouldn't worry  but if you are real concerned call your doctor and tell them|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	What an ar$e!

Secondly, right now your baby is so tiny and so protected that it did not even notice the fall.

It looks like the name of a city and means "leek settlement".|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	feminine!!|`|Ni4aaXTFaa	masculine <br>  -s|`|wrdPBLq0aa	Kinda both, but Leighton is nice for a girl.
yCwPxulYaa	When my baby was 6 weeks old, she ate, slept, and pooped, when she wanted to.  She did not/still does not have a set "schedule" at 6 months old.<br>  <br>  My baby was not a big sleeper as newborn.  She would have 3-4 hours of awake time at one time.  Every baby sleeps different amounts.  When she was that age, she probably slept about 14 hours a day.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	My daughter doesn't have a scheudle, she eats, sleeps and poops when she wants. I give her tummy time, make her smile, cuddle her, kiss her - things like that. I don't know how long she stays awake for though, I don't tend to count.|`|o23hIdOvaa	At around that time, my baby was becoming more active – staying awake for longer periods of time, able to trace objects and being more alert. Between naps, I’d do tummy time, exercise her limbs (playfully pumping her legs/arms, etc), hold up a toy and have her do tracing exercises so that she can follow the toy back and forth, and just lots of loving and cuddles. It was not really a routine, but just taking advantage of her moments awake. It takes some time for babies to fall into an actual schedule, b/c up to and thru 12 months old - their patterns change so much.|`|Ueix2Q7Taa	That's about how Matt was at 6 weeks. Even now he's 9 weeks old and will only nap on me or by himself for half an hour at a time. We really have never had a schedule just feeding him every 3 1/2 to four hours. Other than that he makes the schedule. I do read to him and let him lay on his back on the couch and talk to him. But he mostly just wants to snuggle on me. Babies that age should be sleeping around 15 hours a day.

n6XYYyoLaa	really doesnt' sound like it bc his bedtime is too late; that's probably why he's so tired during the day; i have a nine mo old and she sleeps from around 930 or 10 until 8 am, and still takes a nap in the am, afternoon for a hour or two depending on the day....so total they probably get about the same amt. and every baby has different needs..if he doesn't act sick or  like he's feeling unwell, he's probably fine; if this is a quick change from his usual there may be more going on...try putting him down earlier at night, even if you have to work it up thirty mins every few nights...teething will make them fussy, you need to find out if he's teething, check his gums, if he is, he  may need some pain relief to help him  sleep longer streches and not be so fussy....gl, hth|`|CVdcrY3kaa	That does seem like a lot, but maybe he's getting sick. I'd probably call your Dr's office and speak with a nurse to ask for their advice on whether or not they think he needs to be seen. If he is sick, I hope he feels better soon!|`|mfnugUZJaa	Try putting him to bed at a more appropriate time...like 8 or 9. He's being up too late, that's why he's probably so tired during the day. You need to set a good bedtime and nap routine. Put him to bed at the same time every night and wake him up around the same time every morning. Give him 2-3 naps (no more than 3 unless he really needs them). My daughter is 6 months old and I put her to bed at 9 every night and she wakes up exactly at 9:30 every morning. She'll take a nap around 1 and another nap around 5. Of course, some babies need more sleep than others, but that's all my baby needs.|`|AA12193113	I know if I went to sleep at midnight I would want to sleep alot during the day too.  Does he go to bed at this time everyday?  I try to put my 8 month old son to bed at 8 pm, then he usually wakes at 6 or 7 am.  I try to keep him on this regular schedule or he gets fussy.  Sometimes babies sleep more because they are teething, going through growth spurts, or are just tired.|`|rFtKFp03aa	My 9 month old triplets sleep 16 hours during a 24 hour period<br>  <br>  12 hours at night <br>  <br>  2 - 2 hour naps during the day.. <br>  <br>  Per recommendation by their pediatrician and books I have read they need 16 hours till 1 year then can drop a few.. <br>  <br>  so your man sleeps from 12-5 (5hrs) 6-1 (7hrs) that totals .. 12 hours.. but then went to bed at 330.. for how long?? <br>  <br>  I think he just has a messed up schedule and is trying to get some sleep.. he should sleep more that 5 hours at night.. poor guy|`|BsDv3k5iaa	He may be growing!  Babies sleep more when they are growing!|`|6Q106szjaa	i wouldn't worry too much about it as long as he's acting normal when he's up...you're right maybe he's cutting teeth...ask the dr. at his next check up or just call them? every baby is different. i have a 5 and 3 year old with one on the way i would give anything for them to sleep that much LOL! hope he's ok.|`|DCwGQDO9aa	Yes, this is to much sleep.<br>  <br>  He may have an iron deficiency.<br>  <br>  Please take him to the doctor.
4712f79c3b66a688114af1fc7e707671aa	He might not like you enough to become your boyfriend, or date you. Maybe he just thinks you're better off friends, or isn't ready to take the next step into a relationship with you.<br>  What most people don't realize is that it's not only girls that flirt all the time, it's boys too. They do it because it's fun, not necessarily to get a relationship out of the deal.|`|L6acUNBcaa	If you are 100% sure he doesn't have a girlfriend, then I'd tell him right in his face that you know he doesn't. I personally think he likes you, even though he's really shy or something.<br>  <br>  He shouldn't be lying to you in the first place, so I'd tell him he shouldn't lie to you. Maybe he was covering up for something, maybe his parents don't allow him to go out yet? I don't know, I'm just throwing out ideas here.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|TPCmwFxRaa	He might just be nervous,and might just want to get to know you better. Give him some time and then ask him again! Trust me I have been there! :)|`|uAUswWcJaa	If he flirts with you, then he is just nervous to spend time with you or he is makign you want him more|`|FGZR9RwDaa	maybe hes just a flirt, and hes stupid like all the rest of the guys.
WCvciOQCaa	I don't think your name is so weird, lol. Johanna is a nice name and Ryan isn't so bad. A lot of people are calling their daughters Ryan these days. And it's just your middle name. It's kinda spunky. :P And, yeah, I agree with some other people, nice nicknames are Jo, Jojo, Hanna, Anna. :)|`|MPVNIqeqaa	I think your name is extremely pretty.<br>  Because it is, I don't even think I would want a nickname if I were you.<br>  But here are some nicknames because you DID ask for them (:<br>  <br>  -Hans<br>  -Jojo<br>  -Anna<br>  - Jo Ryan<br>  - Johanna Ry<br>  - Jo<br>  -Jo Ry<br>  - Johans<br>  -Jay Ry<br>  <br>  That's all I could think of.|`|NTKzocAIaa	Jojo   Joanie    Hanna  Jo|`|9q70kt7vaa	Anna<br>  Hannah<br>  J.R.<br>  Joey<br>  Joe<br>  Ry (Riiii)<br>  Johan<br>  lol|`|9gAaahJtaa	anna|`|IhED5vaAaa	You have a male middle name<br>  Maybe keep that to yourself<br>  It sounds cute but when you think of it...|`|9aiqHu4Haa	I like your first name.<br>  <br>  You could use :<br>  Jo Ry LIKE Joy Rider<br>  <br>  Haha, I don't know :P<br>  Just a thought.|`|1fjhg6j4aa	I like the name<br>  <br>  Joey<br>  Jo<br>  Hanna|`|Pw0bi3oGaa	joey....even if u r a girl it's a really cute nickname|`|o17Cy0boaa	good name|`|sYUUKa7yaa	not bad|`|ODeYn6X8aa	if you are a man.........pull yourself together.|`|hr6zfkJJaa	i like ur name.<br>  but this r suggested name i can come up with<br>  Jo Ry<br>  Joha<br>  Jona <br>  johan <br>  yan|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	JoJo<br>  Jo<br>  Joey<br>  Hanna<br>  Anna<br>  JR<br>  RyRy<br>  Ry|`|7xHfvMIZaa	Hanna. :P Guess that's kinda obvious, huh?|`|miFe45quaa	Johanna is pretty.

MDGRFBoRaa	How far along does she think she is? Movement isn't typically felt before at least (and this is fairly uncommon) until the 12th week. If she is getting bigger and feeling what she thinks is movement, she needs to get to the doctor and be checked asap.|`|AA10976444	There is a 1 in 200 chance of pregnancy after a tubal.  I just had one in October, and was told sometimes it happens|`|uuHPneEcaa	well there has been times where people have thought they where pregnant and their mind started playing tricks on them had all the same symptoms as a pregnant woman but there wasn't a baby.. Has ur friend taken a pregnancy test. if not then she should. since she already thinks she is feeling movement. or she needs to go to a doctor ASAP so she can get checked out.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Yes it is possible, it happens.<br>  <br>  Have her take a home pregnancy test.|`|c8e5d630616fd991d57af8eb76b7b3fbaa	It can happen, she needs to see a doctor.|`|7s7XK1Deaa	idk
z8YGEk0qaa	beat her lil butt....i have a 13 year old ghetto "grown" sis....know how you feel...parents don't do anything I just came out and told her next time I catch her stealing any cash from me to fund her weed, ciggs drinks and bum *** boyfriend I was going to beat her ***...in all seriousness.....but your sis is younger....I am going to get so many thumbs down but who cares its my life get over it pple....|`|WT56iKwZaa	Get a lock for your door or a box to lock up your valuables. <br>  <br>   does she steal from just you or from other people too. If it is just you talk to her and tell her that when she takes your things she is stealing. She may not understand that. <br>   If she steals from others also you do need to bring your parents into it.|`|dQ8j4Ei8aa	Take something of her's that she really likes, & see if she gets mad, if she does than tell her that's how you feel when she does it to you, and that she needs to ask your permission first. & lock box good idea, but you shouldn't have to do that in your own home.|`|6EsIv0vZaa	get something to lock it up with a code or a key then hide the box. its likely she wont find it and know the code.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	you dont punish her ..tell your mom its not your place ..its her child|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	get a lock box and lock up the stuff you value|`|ydoIYwGTaa	Get a lock for your door. About $12 at a Hardware store. Takes 5 minutes to put it together; directions are included. Or get her back by waiting until she is not there and taking all of her clothes (or whatever she likes the most) and hiding it. That way she understands what it is like to be stolen from.|`|12AYMyseaa	^^^^^ that wont work kids like that don't care<br>  <br>  tell your parents my lil bros the same way but that method is usually a hit or a miss<br>  <br>  Or you whoop her *** the next time she does it. You'll get in a world of trouble but it will solve your problem.|`|LSJyE4d0aa	Get a lock box and tell your mother about her stealing and let her deal with it. She needs to be puished, but it is the parent's place to do so|`|7qAWqNw5aa	try locking your room, or take somehting really important that belongs to her, just to teach her how it feels
WT56iKwZaa	talk to the teacher about it. teachers do their best to make sure everyone in the class is safe and that nobody is being picked on. But with 20 or more kids it is hard to see it all. Some pickers are able to pick without being caught. So let the teacher know so that they can do something about it.|`|RxeQJcqhaa	Speak with your son's teacher immediately. If you don't receive satisfactory answers as to what will be done about this, speak with the principal. If your son continues to get bullied, which is what schools consider this, contact the police and they will speak with the offenders and their parents.  <br>  <br>  This is no small matter. We had a 7th grader commit suicide 2 weeks ago....he was being tormented at school.|`|7qAWqNw5aa	go straight to the teachers, and bring your son. i was bullied and my mum brought me to my teachers and made me tell who was bulling me, then that kid was called in and it was all sorted out. (Not straight away but really soon after that)<br>  <br>  try talking to the bullys parents as well that might help|`|9v4OInllaa	Confront the teacher and vice principal if you have to.  If you're kid is getting teased and picked at school and if he comes home upset most of the time and looks down you should seriously confront the teacher about this.  Something like this can lead to severe consequences with his behavior and emotion in the future!  In the mean-time, talk to him more.  You know, simple, friendly conversations to let him know you're there for him.  You'd be shocked to know just what talking can do for someone.  Hope he feels better, good luck!|`|dQ8j4Ei8aa	If its really bad, have the principal or teacher contact the kids parents to see what the issue is, tell him to ignore the other kids, if hes not getting ihellt fights then let it be, you do not want to be a hella-copter parent, it's not healthy. But encourage you kid to be strong & to ignore it, maybe the kids that are picking on him have a bad life at home, or are jealous of him for whatever reason.|`|pMw4sGEFaa	You could also have your son talk to the school counselor.  You don't say how he's being bullied, but when this happened to my daughter I told her to hang out with other kids and ignore the mean ones.  She did this, and now the other girls are leaving her alone or being nicer because she didn't let them keep her from being happy.  She now has learned a valuable lesson about how true friends behave.
qIO2VHY8aa	well i am pregnant with twins and had my 1st ultrasound and 7 weeks my pictures are just like yours as far as two separate sacs, but i did see two heartbeats one from each sac. fraternal twins<br>  <br>  goodluck to you|`|GxlkhRfoaa	Looks like twins to me!  Congrats!|`|RdAzsZujaa	Nope, sorry...the other "sac" looking thing is your bladder.|`|ewRjt9vxaa	nurses are just as capable and educated as doctors. they are not stupid. and no the only baby is inside that blob on the right.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Maybe!  I can see where you are thinking the other one is.....but the doctor should have said something, you should call them and see!<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|2LNNY4Pgaa	well i think they would have told you..<br>  wait until the next ultrasound..|`|WuVW9uCAaa	twins congrats|`|ed0955174428e55e7e6205da49319b6eaa	The girl that did your ultrasound is a medical diagnostic sonographer. She has had enough training to see if there are two babies in there. A doctor reads the pictures after she does and confirms or denies the presence of two babies. If they did not say anything to you about it, you probably don't.<br>  <br>  I looked at your ultrasound picture. On the right side where there is a black circular spot with a white "blob"  in the middle is your baby. Just looks like 1 baby to me.|`|SvS9T3Dkaa	hi wel i am a student nurse, and it does look to me there are 2yok sacs in there! but you are only 6 weeks, so i would recommend you do another ultrasound around 12 weeks, so the baby/ies will be bigger, so you can see it more clearly! congratulations on your pregnancy!|`|u3sxwcPoaa	Kinda looks like it but I am in no ways trained to say so. I'd call the doctor, he should have gotten the results. Also, the tech should have told you.|`|SEzQj1F8aa	You should go and talk to your doctor and ask. because it looks like twins my sister just had twin a year ago and it looked like that so ask you doctor.|`|ow9j6hdTaa	I sure as heck hope nobody refers to me as "just a nurse" when I am a professionally trained and educated Diagnostic Medical Sonographer, after spending $40K for schooling.|`|rOfFOcwpaa	It looks as if there are 2 places your baby could be to me, i'm not really sure though.
nBHSCu0Xaa	Well, I think this category was designed for parents seeking help about their adolescents. Not for teens posting stuff like "OmGZzzz I dunno waT to WeaarRRR?!//!?" and "I let him touch me, am i pregerzz?" haha.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	Well its under parenting because its supposed to be for parents asking questions about their teens and adolescents. Just as there is a newborn and baby category. you dont see newborns posting questions in that category do you?|`|tt6SzpTFaa	Not really...no.|`|5IN0AjxOaa	I think we deserve our own category for teens.<br>  So we can get rid of all the little pregnant 12 year olds,<br>  +& It's would be so awesome.<br>  I bet this is prolly the most active category.<br>  <br>  +& I didn't know about it for like ever!<br>  Goshhhhh.|`|ZX2so3twaa	i hate how all the categories are so hard to find.|`|kOoCya9Oaa	How lazy can you get ?|`|uYDoPNv9aa	its a good category i think its actually one of my favorites:)|`|LNRNsbZUaa	Do you even look at the screen when you're on here?|`|AA10598531	what???????<br>  <br>  xoxo<br>      - e
CdJtH0xdaa	I haven't taken an exam in a while, but when I did take exams (such as the SATs, for example), I studied, studied, studied, and then the night before, I took a "day-off" from studying. That worked well for me. I stressed and stressed, and then took a night off from studying the day before the exam, and then I did fine. You really just have to breath, and think positive; you CAN ace the test.

I am not even in your country so.. I am not taking that exam. BUT I am taking a maths exam, that counts right?<br>  <br>  - If you are allowed bring in some water. I always concentrate better and if I don't you can't think straight.<br>  <br>  - You mightn't be allowed but in some of my classes we are allowed to bring something to suck on like a sweet. But you might be caught if you aren't allowed. BEWARE! D:<br>  <br>  - Make sure you have a big breakfast. You don't want to sit there with a hungry stomach all exam D: (I did this once before)<br>  <br>  - Study! Study everything you know will be on the exam and do a little extra work before it. Make sure to read over your notes!<br>  <br>  I can't think very well at the moment but if I think of any more I will edit this! :D Good Luck!|`|nZVmkZSBaa	FCAT !!!!!!!<br>  Lol. I always get 5's.

Mine doesn't. I always did good on those. xD<br>  GOOD LUCK !!! -x-|`|YQrKQ5PAaa	Well, you need to make sure you're not a wreck when you go to take your test first off. Get a good nights sleep, wake up on time, eat a good and healthy breakfast... then off to your tests. :D|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Eat a banana and crew peppermint gum<br>  It's supposed to help.<br>  Something about the fumes of it going into the brain or something like that lmaaoo<br>  <br>  Try it :)|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Thanks! No exams for me, yet :) Anyway, my tips are, avoid coffee the night before, and the morning! and get lots of rest, revise, and most of all, RELAX, RELAX, RELAX :P|`|d397dMRZaa	Study the things you know the least or don't understand. I think that doing past papers or actually answering questions are better than just sitting a reading a revision guide.|`|itwZHhi8aa	CHEAT.

eV5E9MhUaa	Defiantly the octuplet mom with three other sets of twins. The sex change chicks baby will at least be well cared for. She won't have enough time to give them they're basic needs  and also throw in love and play time. I feel sorry for those babies. And one set of twins are autistic as well. That chick is an idiot. By the way... it IS my business, because that chick doesn't have a job and I will be paying for her children with my taxes. She also lives with her PARENTS....|`|P9wMY4Zpaa	the only thing that bothers me about the one who had a sex change and then had a baby is that as soon as the media started reporting on it, they kept going "FIRST MAN PREGNANT" and such..and i was like "no..that would be a woman who is pregnant. sex change or not, she's still biologically a woman. first man pregnant would be REALLY newsworthy."<br>  <br>  meanwhile..EVERYTHING bothers me about Octomom.|`|192VzAFGaa	Goodness. Both are extreme cases, obviously. Pretty much equally horrid. But if I had to pick, I think the Pregnant Man story is worse. Why? Because sex change or not, no person who refers to themselves as a man should ever be pregnant.|`|WuVW9uCAaa	we are no one to judge|`|xmWBzvNSaa	in my personal opinion, we have no rights to judge them. everybody has their own issues and as long as they deal with them responsibly, it's fine. at least the octuplet mom is responsible enough to keep her children and try her best to find a way to raise them. that's far better than some mothers who don't try at all and abandon their children. and the transgender who gave birth to a baby, what's wrong with that? does he cause any problem to the society? i don't think so. these two people are doing no harm. as a matter of fact, they are way better than those bad people on the street who sell drugs, rob, or kill people.|`|3CG3rby0aa	Well neither one of them is good because they are both making money off their crap that they did.  But if I was to pick one I would say the he/she that had the baby and tried to say it was a man giving birth.  That crap is messed up and I am glad that we aren't hearing as much about it anymore.  And I sure as heck am not going to buy that book that they put out either.  That was a female that had that baby no matter what they say.  Men just were not meant to have babies.  God did not put them on the earth for that purpose.|`|2WWEn2mZaa	I think both have serious issue and problems that they should not be visiting upon their kids. However Octumom is expecting everyone but herself to take care of children she was selfish enough to bring into the world. YOu have them you are for them and take care of them-which also means financially. I realize some parents may need financial help at times but to knowingly bring 14 kids in this world and not be able to care for them is uncalled for.|`|n0WnEIopaa	The female who had a sex change isn't being irresponsible.. <br>  <br>  He and his wife can financially support their children, they are a loving family, and not addicted to having babies. <br>  <br>  Not every family has a mom a dad a boy and a girl....|`|SJ9lOnCOaa	OCTOMOM! ... She is just an insane woman who expect people to take care of her! She should have her children taken away until she is mentally and financially stable!<br>  <br>  the other one is just stupid. she is a woman, she has woman reproductive organs..and wants the best of both worlds|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Why are you bothering them? Clearly the octuplet mom has some issues. Either way it's none of my business.|`|AA11542929	the octoplet mother she was only supposed to have twins but the doctors fucked up big time and they are gonna get sued from it. and with the sex change thing.. thats just GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|kVIOtS5gaa	Who are YOU to judge these people? You're sick.|`|rOfFOcwpaa	Maybe the octuplet mother because she's going to need a lot of financial support taking care of 8 children, especially with the economy not looking so good now. There are many transsexuals/transgenders who are mothers and fathers taking care of children, adoptive as well as biologically. The man on Oprah is not the first trans-man to have a child. I'm transgender, and though i can't get pregnant, I would hope to adopt a child or two one day.|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	I personally think OCTOMOM....I mean wtf. And what I dont understand is why the hell are they letting her keep the kids. She cant take care of her kds. She cant even take care of herself.They need to take those kids and put them in homes with people who can care for them,love them,and give them the time they need. She needs to be in a psychward somewhere. She not mentally all together there. And the worst part is we the tax payers are going to be paying for her 14 kids. AND WHAT'S EVEN WORSE SHE LIVIN OFF HER PARENTS. sO YES SHE TAKES THE CAKE!!|`|s4Ak6Z54aa	the woman that changed to a man then got pregnant. there is one thing that will make you man or woman.. the xx or xy. that will never change so neither will ur "sex"    its natural for women to have babies even if its invitro.. its not normal for a woman to change sex.. its not possible.|`|gkXLT9Z9aa	i don't think it's our business to meddle in other people's business. i don't think it's right to ask questions about them in a public forum. it's not necessary.|`|rKCpkBfmaa	first one is worse. I'd never cope with looking after 8 babies!!!!!!!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	If a 'lady' had a sex change,she wouldn't be able to have a baby. Only a woman,with female reproductive organs can have a child..|`|YsQQ30YJaa	The sex change one.The poor kid is going to grow up all confused.
aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	I love it!  I have my own 1 year old Gwen-actually, we call her Gwendy, short for Gwendalyn.<br>  <br>  It is cute, not overused and will grow well with her into adulthood.  There are also a variety of nicknames.|`|DZJsQFGAaa	I like it|`|F0uLexezaa	i've always liked it|`|AOkucu5haa	I like Gwen. I also like Gwyneth and Gwendolyn.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I love it, esp. as a nickname to Gwendolyn (which is one of my fav girls names).|`|Gy8eVhgNaa	I like the name.|`|dY671gAoaa	I really love, its a nice lovely welsh name.<br>  <br>  You could have it short for something as well if you wanted, like:<br>  <br>  Gwéna?lle (Pronounced Gwen-ah-yel) <br>  Gwendoline<br>  Gwenna<br>  Gwenlyn<br>  Gwenifer<br>  Gwenyth<br>  <br>  x|`|AA11413831	i like this name because when she's little you can baby it up a little and call her 'gwennie' or something, but as she grows up, her name can be taken seriously as gwen or gweneth.<br>  <br>  thumbs up.|`|Drb9EP5Kaa	A girl I knew was named Gwennie, I thought it was a cute name, Gwen too.|`|LDywcpv2aa	when you first here it, it sounds like an old lady . . .<br>  but i'm not criticizing your taste in names! no offense!|`|1ad2771a77e03d1afa77d4cef9cdd54baa	Gwen is nice
P0Fjh59Eaa	Diapers!! Diapers!! Diapers!!<br>  <br>  i appreciated those more than anything else! <br>  <br>  what i do for friends as well is a gift bag w/all the little odds and ends people forget. <br>  <br>  my gift bag usually has this stuff in it-<br>  <br>  A package of diapers and wipes<br>  Little Noses (medication)<br>  Mylicon<br>  Infant's Tylenol<br>  Infant's Orajel<br>  Teething Tabs<br>  Gripe Water<br>  and a few teething toys|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Toys are always great. You could also just get a gift certificate, I loved getting those when I had my son. I could buy diapers or whatever I needed for him.|`|X6as2nOAaa	For sure diapers is the best and wipes, lotion, baby bath wash, bibs, burp cloths, a gift card to a store that has baby stuff.|`|gvLjbVFJaa	I like keepsakes for gifts. You could pick them up a baby memory book for them, or a baby photo album geared towards a baby boy. I just recently saw some cute ones for boy's at Target. <br>  <br>  I also like the idea of engraved baby spoons which you can order directly from Gerber, and they are totally cheap. If I recall, they were like $2.95 each! They also have silver baby cups that you could give to them as well. Keeping with the whole keepsake thing, how about a baby quilt, that he could use now and his mom could tuck away for him later on so he could pass it down to his children some day.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to go to the keepsake route, then diapers are a good choice since they are always needed. Toys are good too since it won't be long unitl he'll be able to enjoy them. A Moblie would be good too for his crib. They make some cute ones with airplanes and sports themed ones for baby boys.|`|iMaTMWMxaa	Why don't you make a nappy/diaper cake? Put a bottle of baby wash in the middle and wrap the nappies around. Baby spoons can be the candles of the cake, and put blue ribbon round when you've finished :)|`|CzKrqgmgaa	diapers<br>  picture frames for the nursery<br>  a memory box<br>  a scrapbook kit for mom to make over the next year or so<br>  bibs<br>  car seat cover for the cold weather<br>  soothers<br>  <br>  a good idea is to call the new Mommy and see if there is anything they need for the little one|`|aGORltJPaa	Normally clothes- but get bigger sizes as the baby will grow out of it by the end of the week!<br>  <br>  I always find it best to ASK them what they need.<br>  <br>  With all four of my pregnancies, I just told people what I needed and it made them happier because they were getting you something you actuallly needed!<br>  <br>  AND buy your cousin a present too!  Bunch of flowers would go down a treat- trust me- everyone forgets to buy the mother a present too!|`|8XcRFF6Taa	Diapers are always good:)  But if you want to get something else, my kids really love this turtle night light, it's really cool!

Some women have shorter ones, others have longer ones. The first day of your period is Day 1. If you have a 28 day cycle, then you would start again 27 days after Day 1.|`|llEdx8Q2aa	Lol, I totally understand. That sometimes happens to me too. I get my period in the beginning of the month then towards the very end I get it again. Then it varies but I usually get it at the end of the month again. <br>  <br>  My period is so variant, so I do not really care when it comes as long as it comes but if you really want to see a pattern why do you not start recording on a calendar when you get your period to see if there is a pattern :D|`|7rIAd6gGaa	Don't go by months. Go by days. Your cycle this time was 17 days, so if you're regular, that's what it should be next time. Give or take a day or two. So it would be March 16th or so.

KyFCYs0Yaa	With my first pregnancy, my breasts did not leak at all during pregnancy, but I had colostrum when he was born, and my milk came in 2 days later. They did leak with my second pregnancy, and it was still 2 days after my daughter was born when my milk came in.<br>  I am 28 weeks with my third, and they have been leaking for a couple of weeks now. <br>  You will have milk. Don't worry! and congrats on the baby!|`|98WKYtfwaa	Some leak, some don't, it really just depends on you. If you are going to leak, it'll start anytime in your pregnancy. My friend started leaking from 16weeks and now she's leaking alot. <br>  <br>  If you don't leak, it doesn't mean you won't have any milk. Your breasts start producing milk quite early on in the pregnancy and when your baby is born you have colostrum which is full of antibodies and stuff, you have this for a couple of days before the milk starts coming through.<br>  <br>  You'll definitely be able to breastfeed.|`|6bMBwaosaa	Yes it is common that they can leak in the latter stages of pregnancy but even if they don't your milk will come through once the baby is here. It can be there almost straight away but I have also known some people that it has taken about 12 hours after birth before they can feed.|`|NbgxNAYZaa	Don't worry. When the demand is there the supply will be there. There are hormones that are released during and after birth that will have you producing just enough nourishment for your little one.|`|JAT3n1Qwaa	mine only started about a month  before my daughter came if I remember correctly. Bit I wouldn;t worry about this. After you give birth your body naturally produces colostrum which is thinner and clearer than milk and full of antibodies. The actual milk comes in about 2-3 days after birth. I am speaking from my own experiences here not any way medically. But you will be fine!! Good luck x|`|S9mk7tDKaa	Not every woman's will leak, but it is very common that it happens; and it can happen at any time but primarily it starts around your third and fourth month or so.  I didn't until I was already in my third trimester.|`|MvMT8TD3aa	Before i had my daughter my boobs leaked, not alot but i had to wear breast pads. When i had my daughter my milk came. However when i stopped feeding her it pretty much stopped asap. I think everyone is different. If your worried talk to your miswife? xox|`|52bAHCaUaa	Some do, some don't. Mine didn't when I was pregnant. My milk came in about 2 days after I had my daughter.|`|eV5E9MhUaa	No, your milk will come in soon enough. Don't worry if it doesn't happen until after baby is born also. Your hormones bring on the colostrum. Your going to be able to feed your baby just fine. Also congrats on breast feeding!! That's so GREAT! :)
nwuL7M7saa	What is Preeclampsia?<br>  <br>  Preeclampsia is a disorder that occurs only during pregnancy and the postpartum period and affects both the mother and the unborn baby. Affecting at least 5-8% of all pregnancies, it is a rapidly progressive condition characterized by high blood pressure and the presence of protein in the urine. Swelling, sudden weight gain, headaches and changes in vision are important symptoms; however, some women with rapidly advancing disease report few symptoms. <br>  <br>   Typically, preeclampsia occurs after 20 weeks gestation (in the late 2nd or 3rd trimesters or middle to late pregnancy), though it can occur earlier. Proper prenatal care is essential to diagnose and manage preeclampsia. Preeclampsia, Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH) and toxemia are closely related conditions. HELLP Syndrome and eclampsia are other manifestations of the same syndrome. It is important to note that research shows that more women die from preeclampsia than eclampsia and one is not necessarily more serious than the other. <br>  <br>  Globally, preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a leading cause of maternal and infant illness and death. By conservative estimates, these disorders are responsible for 76,000 maternal and 500,000 infant deaths each year.|`|B8Gwxo1laa	What is Preeclampsia?<br>  <br>  Preeclampsia is a disorder that occurs only during pregnancy and the postpartum period and affects both the mother and the unborn baby.

Surely she checked your blood pressure while you were there?  I am not prego but am ttc and I do have high blood pressure. When I forget my medicine, I get those annoying headaches.  If your blood pressure was normal I wouldn't worry much about it.  A little swelling during pregnancy is normal.  Good luck, hope you feel better! Headaches are the worst!!

The color varies on how old the blood is. Red and brown colors are normal. Green and yellow are not so normal. Having brown blood means that is has been inside you for a longer time than the others. Once I had this same problem (but wasn't on clomid) and my period always comes on time but one month there was only a little blood lasting a week, just little spots of blood, same colors and everything. The next month my period returned to normal. So this is just your period acting funny. If you are really worried about this talk to your mom or your doctor. Hope I helped. Good Luck.

ikO2If2oaa	the baby probably dropped more but it doesnt mean that shes ready to come out. and when your stomach gets hard it could be early contractions called braxton hicks..dont worry shes just moving<br>  <br>  What are Braxton Hicks contractions?<br>  <br>  Braxton Hicks contractions are sporadic uterine contractions that start about 6 weeks into your pregnancy, although you won't be able to feel them that early. You probably won't start to notice them until sometime after mid-pregnancy, if you notice them at all. (Some women don't.) They get their name from John Braxton Hicks, an English doctor who first described them in 1872.<br>  <br>  As your pregnancy progresses, Braxton Hicks contractions tend to come somewhat more often, but until you get to your last few weeks, they'll probably remain infrequent, irregular, and essentially painless. Sometimes, though, Braxton Hicks contractions are hard to distinguish from early signs of preterm labor.<br>  <br>  Play it safe and don't try to make the diagnosis yourself. If you haven't hit 37 weeks yet and you're having more than four contractions in an hour — or you have any other signs of preterm labor (see below) — call your caregiver immediately.<br>  <br>  By the time you're within a couple of weeks of your due date, your contractions may get more intense and more frequent, and they may cause some discomfort. Unlike the earlier painless and sporadic Braxton Hicks contractions, which caused no obvious cervical changes, these contractions may help your cervix "ripen" — gradually soften and thin out (efface) and maybe even dilate a bit. This period is sometimes referred to as pre-labor.<br>  How can I tell the difference between Braxton Hicks and true labor contractions?<br>  <br>  In the days or weeks before labor, Braxton Hicks contractions may intermittently become rhythmic, relatively close together, and even painful, possibly fooling you into thinking you're in labor. But unlike true labor, during this so-called false labor the contractions don't grow consistently longer, stronger, and closer together.<br>  What can I do if my Braxton Hicks contractions are making me uncomfortable?<br>  <br>  If you're within a few weeks of your due date, try these measures:<br>  <br>  ? Change your activity or position. Sometimes walking provides relief. At other times, resting eases contractions. (True labor contractions, on the other hand, will persist and progress regardless of what you do.)<br>  <br>  ? Take a warm bath to help your body relax.<br>  <br>  ? Try drinking a couple of glasses of water, since these contractions can sometimes be brought on by dehydration.<br>  <br>  ? Try relaxation exercises or slow, deep breathing. This won't stop the Braxton Hicks contractions, but it may help you cope with the discomfort. (Use this opportunity to practice some of the pain-management strategies you've learned in your childbirth preparation class.)<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|AiJeS6I1aa	You are describing Braxton-Hicks contractions.  This is your uterus practicing for labour.  It is largely not painful, but some women feel some pressure with this.<br>  <br>  As for sitting on the toilet and feeling something pushing down, it was probably just your positioning.  When you squat/sit on the toilet, your pelvis opens up a bit, and the baby probably just moved more in to your pelvis briefly.  It is normal to feel quite a bit of pressure if the baby pushes directly on your cervix.  Perhaps he/she was just flipping around.<br>  <br>  When to be concerned:<br>  <br>  -regular tightenings of your uterus (every 15 min or sooner) that become painful or are associated with low back ache or menstrual-like cramping<br>  <br>  -vaginal bleeding, even if it is just a few spots<br>  <br>  -continuous clear fluid leaking from the vagina<br>  <br>  -baby not moving as expected<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you are having perfectly normal pregnancy symptoms.  Some women feel much more pressure through their pregnancy than others.  And some get more Braxton-Hicks contractions than others.  Every woman and every pregnancy is different.<br>  <br>  Congratulations and good luck!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	That could be braxton hicks contractions, or just the baby moving.  It shouldn't really be that tender though.<br>  <br>  No you don't need an ultrasound to determine your baby's position, it should be flipping around all the time so what does it tell you if you do an ultrasound?<br>  <br>  You can sometimes feel pressure on your cervix, that's not a problem.  It shouldn't be painful.  Try holding your belly up while you pee, that may help|`|5jqFrtrwaa	my son did this when I was carrying him - he's stick out a leg or a fist and my belly would go rock hard - it was so funny - also the pushing down feeling you are having is probably the same thing just it stretching as it has very little room now<br>  <br>  Don't panic, it's normal - Enjoy your pregnancy and good luck<br>  xo

sHk1Tdmqaa	I have used ovulation-calculator.com and fertility friend.  They both are good.  However fertility friend has lots of tools and information that tie into the calculator.  It was also very easy to use.|`|ZdAVk5Qxaa	I am currently using an ovulation calculator/calendar, and i would also like to see if this method works, I should know in about 2 weeks so lets cross our fingers.|`|Yc2xj1Wpaa	Didnt work for me!|`|2HETgiwgaa	I'm using fertilityfriend.com - it's making it much easier to understand my own fertility.

clc6qQDAaa	When you think about being pregnant you fool your self into thinking you are having the symptoms 5 tests probably wont be wrong but its always best to be safe. You can go to the doctors and get tested or you can wait a few weeks and take another test. <br>  Best of luck xxx|`|WuVW9uCAaa	one for sure sign ur preggo is the metallic taste in ur mouth|`|ePcNVX10aa	The first thing you should do is go to your GYN and get a blood test.  This will definitely determine if you are pregnant.  I wouldn't wait either.  The worst thing is if your are and are harming your baby.  You will have to live with that for the rest of your life.  Don't wait any longer.|`|7t5Gkeqkaa	Paxil made me gain weight, tired, weird taste in my mouth. It actually reminded me of symptoms of being pregnant.  You could always go get a blood test done to know for sure! Good luck!|`|hzY7FTkoaa	i suggest you go to your gp they will know more about it than anyone else :) .|`|8gCe3vRDaa	to be sure ask your doctor to do blood test. It will reveal for sure whether you are pregnant or not. All the best|`|ed0955174428e55e7e6205da49319b6eaa	Go to the doctor as soon as possible to find out! That's the only way that you will know for sure.
oHNrktxTaa	I suggest you try using the Clear Blue Easy digital OPK sticks. They are very easy to use. Depending on the length of your cycle, it will give you days for you to begin testing. They are sticks that you pee on & will help determine your LH (lutenizing hormone) surge prior to ovulation. It is either a O or a smiley:) when there is a positive. You than have 24-36 hours to increase your chances on becoming pregnant. <br>  <br>  BABY DUST!|`|Q05rrSX4aa	It's hard to say, you ovulate at different times if your cycle is 30-36 days.  The time between your ovulation and your period is the exact same every month, that is your Luteal Phase.  So most luteal phases are 12-17 days, average 14 days.  So on a 36 day cycle your fertile time would be CD 22, that would be the day your ovulated, and a few days before that you would be fertile (if your luteal phase is 14 days) and on a 30 day cycle (again using the 14 day luteal phase) your ovulation would be on day 16 making 4-5 days before that your fertile time leading up to and a dady after O.  I hope this makes sense.|`|PEM4pm80aa	I am not sure what the answer is but this site might be helpful for you <a href="http://www.mymonthlycycles.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.mymonthlycycles.com/.</a> I am in the same boat as you, I have an irregular period and find it hard to find my fertile days and the day I am actually ovulating.

FIOOKpz0aa	I'm about 14 weeks now, but when I was 6 weeks I didn't have any clue I was pregnant until one of the later days in the week/the seventh week.

All Fun!<br>  Good Luck! <br>  xx|`|PXnn6LoPaa	be happy!  you could be puking your guts out like so many others!  my mom and lots of others don't ever have symptoms.  it's normal.  count yourself lucky!|`|L2Tvu7VLaa	I'm a bit farther than you (I'm at 14 weeks) but that's not so much I don't remember 6 weeks. I actually didn't have much symptoms then either. it was at about 5 and a half weeks that I started to get some nausea but it didn't hit hard till a week later. My cravings really haven't hit yet at all. A heightened sense of smell is actually what i noticed first. Don't worry if your not feeling anything yet, every pregnancy is different. And try picking up a good book, I use "What to Expect when your expecting" most. It goes over everything. I even found I had symptoms without knowing they were symptoms until i read those parts. it also shows while reading it that every women's body works differently. You'll see answers to questions about "why is my skin so oily" followed by "why is my skin so dry" so you'll find that you don't have to fit specific things perfectly. After a few more weeks you should be able to hear the heart beat at the doctors office. Hearing that will make you feel a lot better. Symptoms or no symptoms a heartbeat proves there's something in there :D<br>  <br>  Congrats!!!!|`|nwuL7M7saa	I'm 5w 3d... Boobs hurt. Slight cramping.

You should start feeling a little movement which will come like a little pop in your stomach at around three to four months.  Sometimes it takes longer. It can be easily be confused as gas. Your baby is not even fully developed yet and it won't be for about another 6 weeks.  My advise is reading up on it and when it is time, take your Lamaze classes.  They are very informative and let you know what you should expect.  A lot of people think taking the classes is a waste of time, but it gives you control because you are educated on what's happening with your body and what you should expect.  It was the best thing I ever did.|`|GFY5CXrXaa	everyone is different. i am 5w .i have no morning sickness but my main symptom is my brests, they are so sore to touch i cant even roll around in bed. i have slight abdominal pain but not alot. i am really emotional, like all the time, everytime someone speaks to me i cry i cant help it. haha..  <br>  you might just be a lucky one :)|`|DrIITL0Iaa	i am pushing my 6th week (i assume)<br>  and i am eating a lot and my boobs hurt some.<br>  very tired at work and at  home... pretty much all the time.<br>  <br>  and today i was emotional. hope that helped :]|`|25l10HL8aa	I am at about the 7th week and I have had the worst morning sickness so be prepared. And enjoy it while you can.
30BC5dBVaa	It could be the beginning of AF. <br>  <br>  Or, you could have experienced implantation bleeding. Normally you'd only notice a small (very small, like spotty) amount of blood-tinged mucus when you wipe after using the bathroom. There isn't enough for a pad. It would last 1-3 days, then disappear <br>  <br>  Sometimes HPTs don't register the low levels of hcg in your body. You might need to wait longer, a week (fingers crossed no AF) and then take another test. Or, you can go to your doctor or the hospital and ask for a bloodtest. You should ask for a bloodtest anyway, if you go a week longer without a period & you still see a negative HPT. <br>  <br>  Baby Dust!|`|8gCe3vRDaa	pink blood could be from implantation. Wait for a week and take HPT again... All the best
1uAduUKhaa	If you are a mature young woman that loves children I would think that you will find parents that would love to have you care for their children. <br>  <br>  You should take a 'Safe Sitter' course at your local hospital or 'Y' so that mothers can be sure that you will have been on how to bathe a child, change his diapers, comfort him if he is trouble and know what to do if he becomes ill or hurts himself. <br>  <br>  I began babysitting when I was 12 for a family and by the time I was 15, I had a full time summer job babysitting their 11 year old son at a time when the boys mother became ill. I cared for this boy, nurtured him and loved him. I am 26 now and the boy still calls me "Aunty" which means so much to me. <br>  <br>  Experience, maturity, training and having a love of children are very important if you want to be good a babysitting. When you are babysitting, you taken on the role of being the mommy so if If you let you natural maternal instincts guide you, babysitting can be a wonderful way to understand your possible future role as a mother.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	i answered this with  a no, youre both too young the first time, and i stand by my same answer this time. 13 is too young to be baby sitting, especially for very young children.|`|lTkYWiy5aa	I started babysitting when I was 12. You could always test them out by watching them watch the kids, or leaving them for just an hour if you have concerns.|`|aKvxy3xBaa	Probably yes, talk to their parents also and see if the parents think their child is mature enough to watch your.|`|IC9ikMKoaa	I am 13 and i babysit alot all by myself and i am mature so i say yes why wouldn't you?|`|AA10943329	If I knew them well I may.

At 13, you are rather young and probably have no experience, unless of course, you have experience with younger siblings. I first babysat at 12 and knew nothing at all but bluffed my way into looking after a boy of 3, so I know that at 13 you will not know much. Wait a year or so, or go help a mum look after a youngster and learn what you have to do. You ask for reasons: Can you change a diaper? Have you taken a boy to the toilet or bathed a boy before? Those are the things you'll need to know. If you are his mum, you'll know what to do and won't want someone inexperienced looking after him. You'll have to overcome all those things.  Good luck to you. Hope it works out OK.|`|XT0sGJchaa	I wouldn't hire two. Maybe just one. If both were there they would be a distraction to each other.<br>  And I would only hire someone that young if I was only going to be out for an hour or so. Also it depends on the age of the child they would be babysitting. I would never leave a child under 4 with a 13 year old.|`|AA11212578	Depend on your references and how long you were going to babysit (3-4 hours in evening, all night, etc).<br>  <br>  Keep a list of phone #'s of other people you babysit so parents can call them and hear about how good you are at babysitting.|`|4Qb1FNH2aa	I would hire one but not two, somehow I would trust them more alone. Two 13 year olds will get into mischief where one might have been responsible, you know?|`|KV590Y6Saa	It depends how old the babysitee was.

If you're measuring 3cm under though then they will send you for a growth scan to make sure everything is ok. <br>  <br>  If your ultrasounds say your 28weeks then go by that, not by the measurement of your uterus.<br>  <br>  No, it's not abnormal at all though.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	Not at all. Actually, the measurement depends on where the baby is at the moment, so it could change. With my daughter, mine was always a few weeks bigger, but then I went to one appointment and it was smaller than the last time. The doctor explained that it isn't meant to be completely accurate, and my daughter was fine. They just want to make sure it's not way too small, and that it does get bigger as the months pass. Congrats!|`|0iUxfCMcaa	its ok to be off by 2 either way. like measuring under by two or measuring over by two. that is normal for some people.|`|pUltSWNnaa	That is normal.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Nope lol.

FkGh0LuWaa	Your doctor is nuts and I would change doctors if I were you.  Also are you sure it is diaper rash and not a yeast infection?  My son get a yeast infection every time he gets diarrhea.  It starts out looking like a diaper rash then turns into a big red rash, bumps and then blisters. Try putting some Monistat yeast infection cream on it and see if it starts helping.  If it is diaper rash and not yeast try A+D ointment.  It works a lot better then desitin.  Also when you change his diaper don't rub instead pat him clean and try and leave him without a diaper.  You can place a soft towel under him.|`|zjFMdPOiaa	I am a mother of 2, a grandmother of 1, and ran a daycare home for many years.  The BEST thing for your baby is Caldesene Powder.  It is a little hard to find, but it works MIRACLES.  <br>  <br>  It is a powder , so you sprinkle it on.....no rubbing and it is absolutely amazing.  Here is a Walgreen's link with a picture so you will know what to look for.<br>  <br>  I always used it on all the kids.  The daycare Moms would bring their babies w/a sore bottom and it would be cleared up before they went home.  They would come back the next day w/a sore bottom again and the parents would always ask me what I was using to clear it up.  (Of course, that was if I forgot to tell them.)  <br>  <br>  You are doing exactly what you are supposed to do.  Poor baby......try this powder. (Just be careful to not poof the powder in the babies face.  You would not want him to breath it in.)<br>  <br>  Good luck.......I hope that it will work for your baby as well as it always has for all of my 'kids.'<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.jsp?CATID=100352&id=prod1081" rel="nofollow">http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.j...</a>|`|uAyYRXnvaa	The absolute best thing is to get yourself an aloe vera plant (they're a succulent so really easy to look after).  Break of a leaf, split it open and put the juice straight on the rash.  It gives them instant relief and heals the area very quickly, as well as giving a protective coating.  Otherwise good old olive oil is the second best thing.  And as others have siad - let him go nappy free for a bit.  The poor little bugger - hope he gets better soon!|`|0ky4TktEaa	For now, there's not much you can do until the diarrhea goes away. Allowing your child to play naked in the sun every few hours for about a week will keep the whole area drier. This does a lot to help speed up the healing process. However, i would not advise that now as he may poop everywhere. Get that under control and then try it. Or if you're up for potentially cleaning up a big poopy mess, allow him to do it now. You said he goes every couple of hours, so next time you change him, clean him up and start immediately. <br>  <br>  Instead of Desitin, use baby powder to decrease the amount of moister in his diaper when he's wearing one. You also may want to use soap and water as opposed to wipes as much as you can. Wipes have added stuff that can actually prolong a bad diaper rash.|`|KV590Y6Saa	1. Find a new doc, if it's blistering and he said that, kick hi to the curb.<br>  2. Soak his little bottom in warm water, and pat try.  If you can let him go without a diaper for awhile. <br>  3. Ask your new doc for some "silver something" cream.  It has silver in it and it helps with the healing process.<br>    Good luck.|`|AA10325228	My mom used to used corn starch paste..<br>  <br>   Corn starch with a little water in it (looks sort of like glue when mixed together) <br>   Also try baby powder|`|8bad940dcaffd1c900bc35549573d63caa	Your Dr. is right waiting it out is the best thing. You are changing him right after he goes and your right its making it very raw but just think about how much harder you have to wipe to take off the cream. everytime he goes and its time to change him rinse him off in the tub and pat him dry. i know its a pain to have to do every two hours but just think about how soothing its going to be for the baby. babies are very quick healers. if you do this everytime you will see by the end of the day how much better it looks. <br>  good luck|`|3HR1SfGMaa	What I usually do for my daughters diaper rashes, don't wipe with baby wipes, only pat.  If patting isn't enough to clean him up then you need to let him soak it off in the bathtub.  The cream that I usually use (yes I know its a funny name but it works really well!) is Bordeaux's Butt Paste.  I usually apply it liberally, and then I use baby powder with aloe as well.  Even the worst of her rashes usually clear up in a day when I do that.  <br>  And also like others have said, diaper free helps as well for as long as possible.|`|G0qeQOhoaa	My son is extremely fair skinned, so we deal with a lot of skin rashes and things like that, to include frequent diaper rashes, no matter how much we change him. The best solution I have found is to not use wipes, use a warm wash cloth, with just water, and if he poops, then obviously, use a little soap. Leave him diaperless as often as possible, sure you will have to clean up some messes, but it helps. And take some desitin and A+D ointment, and mix them in your hand, then put them on him. It works wonders for us! When we tried that the first time, he had the blisters too, and one or two had actually opened up! ANd he was crying if we used desitin plain, but he didnt cry at all when we used the mix. i am sorry you guys are going through this, its never easy when your baby is hurting :( Good luck!|`|AA10480735	Your doctor is a nut head. Your child is in pain! I don't know if I'm spelling this right, but Boudreaux's Butt Paste worked miracles with my baby sister!|`|TJ4q7X8Vaa	let him have some fresh air. just lay out some towels on the floor with some toys that are easy to wash with bleach (i.e. no fabric) and let him play for a while like that.|`|Rbm99GOcaa	Corn Starch is better then baby powder. When you get like a rash or chafing you use it and it is gentle enough for baby|`|NvGD4bKPaa	Balmex|`|AA11212578	I agree w/ Lindsey.    Let him go diaper free for the afternoon.  Hopefully it's not too much of a mess.......
Ej2EOsvKaa	This is one of the hardest things I had to do. Luckily you seem responisble in the fact that you do not want to wait to long for the medical treatment and what not. I did not tell my parents until I was 3 months! So that is totally not responsible.<br>  <br>  Anways, there are so many different ways of doing it. Just make sure you tell them, "mom dad...I need to tell you something that will change my life and yours...I did somthing irresposible and now im pregnant" <br>  No easier way of doing it.As long as they know that you did wrong and you admit it they will see you as the bigger person. <br>  <br>  Ive heard that people also wrote their parents letters told them on the fone or even text them! Good luck!<br>  <br>  :)|`|p0prrzf2aa	just tell them, because if you don't tell them soon and how you want to, you'll be upset. it's best to just tell them to their face like an adult|`|soFpywFcaa	sit them down and just talk to them but before you do that you need to figure out if you are keeping the baby or not because that is the first thing that they will ask you good luck|`|xq7S9H5Raa	There is no other specific way to tell them.  You just have to.  I am 32 and I am having a hard time telling my parents about my pregnancy eventhough I am grown and have my own house and have a career.  I could understand how you feel because I am scared to tell my parents because I am not married and pregnant.  You just have to sit and tell them.  Best of luck!|`|AA11542929	well they wont like ur boyfriend for much longer.. but u need to sit down with ur parents and tell them and make it known that u will be in school, u will get a summer job, u will support this baby and so will ur boyfriend.. u need to tell them or they will find out by themselves and well theyll be pissed off more..|`|TJ4q7X8Vaa	do some research first on prenatal care and what, if anything, you need to change in your lifestyle for your baby like your diet or certain activities. i would also check into doctors and see which ones take your insurance or if you will need medicaid, find out how to get on that. find out what you can do to get ahead in your schooling like quitting extracurricular activities to go to night school and taking summer school classes so that you won't get behind when you leave to have your baby.<br>  when you sit down with your parents tell them that you realize that you are young and made a mistake but that you are ready to face it and take responsibility. go on to tell them your plan for prenatal care and your education and what you will need from them. show them that you can be mature about the situation and i think that even though they will probably be disappointed and maybe even mad, they will appreciate that you have taken the first step on your own and that it can all work out in the end.|`|GFY5CXrXaa	i just told my parents 3 days ago i was pregnant, an i knew because they loved me that it would be ok.  your parents will be more upset the longer you leave it as they will hate the thought of you trying to deal with this on your own. you are going to need you parents more now than ever, there is going to be no easy way to tell them but the sooner you do the sooner you will have to love an support you need right now..  good luck hun xx|`|ed0955174428e55e7e6205da49319b6eaa	Oh wow! This is a tough one! I would start off telling the parent that you feel the most close to. Maybe you should tell your mother first. Fathers usually can't think of their daughters being past the age of 5. You are still such a little girl in his mind. Be prepared for lots of yelling, crying, blaming the boyfriend, etc. etc. etc. Whatever you do, tell them as soon as possible. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|gkXLT9Z9aa	there is no secret good way to tell them. no matter how you tell them-they will be angry and disappointed at first. you know you're too young-but what's done is done. you just have to sit them and tell them. maybe have your boyfriend so he can show that he is supporting you. your parents will get over it eventually. they'll have a grandchild soon and nothing can hinder that excitement. good luck!|`|Vv6Dg6Q0aa	Say this:<br>  <br>  "Mum, Dad, I'm pregnant. I'm keeping the brat and I fully expect you to pay for everything. By the way, you have no choice in the matter"<br>  <br>  That will make them so happy they will quickly forget their daughter was too stupid to wait until she could afford a kid.|`|T5jGutzkaa	Sit with them when they are in a good mood say mom/dad i need to talk to you privately. Try to have a good mood and probablythey will to try.. Mom/dad you wont believe me but im pregnant. :]<br>  <br>  Hope that helped xoxox|`|tMtLcVkeaa	Maybe try talking about other things at first, maybe go on a drive or walk with the more understanding one, and just tell them. maybe start by saying, something like "please don't freak out, I just want you to help me out"|`|nyTVdVPqaa	Telling them face to face is a brave way to do it. You seem very sensible in your thoughts but don't be suprised if they scream and shout at you. however you try to cushion the blow.<br>  I personally would take the cowards way out and write a very length letter telling them your situation, how you feel, what you want to do, if your boyfirend has said he will support you, and how worried you that you have upset or disappointed them. I would then leave the letter on the table and go out for the day. Adding on to the letter that when they feel they can talk to you about the situation to contact you so you can all discuss it calmly. This will give them time to digest the imformation, and talk about their own feelings about it, instead of just showing their inital shock to you and things getting out of control.<br>  Good luck and I hope it works for you
JnLoHaoAaa	It's quite possible. I found out at about 15 weeks that I'm having a little boy|`|iKPSOMiSaa	yes more than likely. i found out when i was 19 1/2 wks with my first.|`|BilLTGLFaa	Maybe, I went in for my 19 week ultrasound and the umbilical cord was between the babys legs.

Good Luck and Baby Dust to You|`|lTkYWiy5aa	Trying is a very trying experience. Often we think it will happen right away when in reality it can take up to a year and that's normal. So prepare yourself for it to take awhile (even though it could happen right away!). Get a checkup and mention to your doctor that you are thinking about trying s/he will probably recommend taking a prenatal vitamin. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|KNxs4PrZaa	just start trying, there will never be a perfect time to have kids there will always be something to worry about so if you both want kids and are thinking about it i would say start.  you dont have to dive head first in doing all of the counting days and body temps and stuff but you certainly could start taking a prenatal vitamin and stop all birth control measures and see what happens.  if after awhile you are not pregnant and you feel more urgent about it then you can take further measures. but dont stress yourself out, just go with the flow.|`|8XjJzj7Naa	No one is truly ready for children, especially first time parents, that is just a proven fact. I would say that your situation sounds stable and if you think you can handle it then go for it. Give it a go, because it could take awhile to first get pregnant. It took me 16months and I was only 21 years old. Good Luck...|`|8a949c7984d501f70f4b690183ae5920aa	Three months prior to wanting to get pregnant, stop taking birth control. Make sure to write down your period days anad ovulation days. Stop drinking , smoking, or use of drugs of any kind.  Ask a doctor if you you need to ween off prescription drugs.  A month before begin taking prenatal vitamins.<br>  My husband and I have had three pregnancies all on the first try.  I was over 30 with all of them.  try to fertilize egg three days before ovulation and on ovulation day then day after.<br>  hope it works.  Worked like a charm for us.

s7f9ojYMaa	When I was little (about 4/5-yrs old), I spat on my father when he arrived home from work (albeit not in the face).<br>  <br>  I had never even spat before, and had no concept of spitting but my brothers thought it would be a bit of fun to teach me how to spit that day.  They told me how really it cool it was and that my dad would like it if I spat on him when I come home. Foolishly, he come home, I run over to him *SPIT* and within a blink of an eye he returned a hard *SLAP* accross my face.<br>  <br>  I learned a very quick lesson not to spit, especially on someone else....especially my dad!   I just run off crying - not quite understanding what had happened.<br>  <br>  It was grossly unfair that I was punished and my brothers got away with it even although it was their fault.<br>  <br>  That said, my dad wasn't an unreasonable man and did come and see me later to find out why I done it.  Thats when the truth come out, and altough I don't think he regreted slapping me for it, he at least understood why it happened and I understood never do to it again.<br>  <br>  I'm sure my brothers got in to trouble for things as well, but it was more of a shouting at that anything else.<br>  <br>  There were few things that I done when I was little to deserve being hit, but that was definately one of them, so no loss of respect there!<br>  <br>  So despite that sorry tale - what would I do if my child spat in my face.<br>  <br>  It would be an immediate slap accross the face or a hard spanking.  Age would be irrelevent in a situation like this 5 or 15 (or older)!!  Finding out why they done it and explaining why they must never do it would come afterwards.|`|wRHhpanmaa	my mom used to do this thing called "letting the devil bite your tongue for spitting" and when i was little I would spit on my brothers, and my mom would take a dab of hot sauce put it on my tongue, and make me keep it on there for 20 seconds, and each time it got longer (40 sec, 1 minute, etc.) Then make me apologize. <br>  <br>  I learned quickly not to spit|`|ZZztSumhaa	Whenever my son did that i used to spit back in his face, he hated it.|`|hORVMOHKaa	spank them and then sit them in the corner<br>  <br>  how else will they learn not to do it|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Depends on their age.  If my 5 year old did it, I would probably take away a priveledge and give him a time out.  If my 15 year old did it, I would have to restrain myself from slapping his a$$ to the floor!|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Well, unless you spat in their face or physically assaulted them, that's no kind of provocation. <br>  <br>  Parents should ground their children and then TALK, not shout TALK to them.|`|s8VgyzE2aa	Then I would re-evaluate my parenting abilities and parenting style because I must have gone wrong somewhere if my child is so out of Control they would spit in my face. <br>  <br>  I have 4 boys age 14, 14, 11 and 9 and none of them have ever or would ever spit at me at all, never mind in my face.<br>  <br>  I think it's funny how every parent here is dishing out punishments to the child rather than looking into themselves and their parenting to figure out why that would happen. It's just punish punish punish. Parents always want to blame behavior on the child rather than figuring out how the child got so out of control in the first place and changing something in their parenting.|`|es8CfccCaa	Don't hit the child! I know that would be a normal reaction to that. Never hit your child. Take away something the child really likes - no TV - No Video Games, their favorite thing for a certain amount of time.<br>  Once you set that time, even when they apologize, the time clock stays on! Make sure you make them know how hurt they made you feel.<br>  Another choice, if that don't work, I would just shock the child and and give it right back without mercy and then send the child to their room! No TV  No Friends over - That one thing that they really like.<br>  Just let them know - "I don't want to look at you! You really hurt me!" <br>  Sounds cruel, but if you don't put an end to it now, it will only get worse.<br>  Good Luck|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Whatever is normal punishment, x2.

29a2wm7Eaa	First of all, thanks!  Believe it or not though, it's been easier for me to be a single working parent than it was to be a married parent (working or not).  <br>  <br>  In your shoes, I'm not sure I would bother putting the kids in some sort of care and going back to work unless it's for your own sanity.  Trust me, I know what you're doing at home is a hundred times harder than being at work.  At least at work you get that hour a day every day they call lunch that is all yours to do with what you wish.  And sick days if you've got care because you usually work...so if you do get sick you can send the kids off like usual and at least have those 10 hours to baby yourself.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you've got the choice to either stay home or go out.  The kids will be fine either way as long as you get them great care.  They will follow your lead...if you present this as a great opportunity for everyone...the kids to go and play with other kids and for you to be with adults...they will begin to see it the same way.|`|MzHwklzKaa	As a day care worker, I can tell you that parents that work full time DO miss things.<br>  <br>  I used to feel so sorry for parents missing out on so many of their kid's milestones and general greatness.  <br>  <br>  Sorry, I just had to throw that in.  I guess it has nothing to do with your questions.|`|iFmKcRl0aa	I hope you don't mind that I'm not a single parent, but I have worked full-time and cared for our son at home since he was born. As far as managing everything goes, some days you do quite well and some days you don't. I tend to want to control too many things, so I've had to learn to let things like a messy house go once in awhile in favor of a trip to the park. It's a balancing act, and you eventually learn how to organize your days to fit in what you consider to be the highest priorities. The other (often unnecessary) things will start falling by the wayside.<br>  <br>  I always thought I would want to be "just" a stay-at-home mom (as if that's an easy occupation). But for me, going back to work has been fulfilling. I worked hard to become good at my job, and it's helpful for me to remember that I'm good at something other than laundry, diaper duty and cleaning up spills!|`|c6RGmMGjaa	I'm a single mum, I don't work at the moment but I'm attending full-time university so I guess it's the same thing really.My son is nearly 6 now but before he started nursery aged 3 I did work part-time and he'd mainly be babysat by his grandparents but when he reached school age I decided to go for a real career. He started full-time school aged 4 and I've had a childminder for him since then, I take him or pick him up myself when my timetable allows but she will take him or pick him up for me the days I can't, it works very well for us all - the important thing is to find a real nice person that you can trust fully. Being a single parent there were lots of incentives for me to go back to uni and 85% of my childcare costs are paid for me along with other grants that are very helpful, I'm actually better off as a student than I was when I worked.<br>  I wouldn't be scared that you'll miss something, I think it's healthy to be away from your children some of the time, they need to build a sense of independence, if you're really not comfortable then you could wait until they all start full time school, that way you wouldn't have been spending that time with them anyway. Luckily I have a very strong family network around me and although his father is absent from his life he has my family who are wonderful and have always been there for us. It can be tough/tiring at times but I think it'll all be worth it in the near future.|`|prqrQcd1aa	When i am working i take my kids to work with me... It's the only job i'll work at that i'll be able to do so, but it's so much fun to still have them around! <br>  I stay up pretty late, that is how i get time for myself. My boyfriend and I both pitch in when we are both working to take care of the house. <br>  I work at the same place seasonally. So i don't really know how to tell you to get back into the workforce, other than to just mentally prepare yourself!
Fd4lITkvaa	As long as everyone is healthy I don't see why not. I had my son out at family events at 5 days old and he did great. He had his first illness at 11 months, just a cold. <br>  <br>  Vaccines only cover a handful of rare illnesses so don't make a huge difference. On top of that it takes 2-3 doses to be fully effective so you would have to keep your baby in to 4-6 months if that really mattered. Babies in the US often start daycare at 6wks, 2wks before there first set of shots.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	Yes........just try to keep anybody who is sick away from your your baby since he/she is so little!  My daughter was born on 11/28/07 and my best friends son turned 1 on 12/12/07 and I took her to his bday party!  It was fun to show her off.  Honestly I took my daughter with me everywhere I went when she was little since I was breast feeding I kind of had to take her!  Im sure he/she will be fine.  Don't be scared to tell people to stay away if they are sick and to wash their hands if they want to hold your baby.............I did!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	From the picture it looks like you had your baby in a hospital.<br>  <br>  The hospital has far more germs, and antibiotic resistant germs than a kids party.<br>  <br>  Also most vaccines take multiple doses to provide full coverage -are you going to stay home until your child is 2 years old?|`|tbeO3Lataa	I think it would be fine! Plus I am sure you would like a chance to spend time with adults, LOL.<br>  <br>  Yeah, I wouldn't let anyone hold him, and bring his carseat (is yours removable) with you so he can sleep in it.<br>  Have fun!|`|zSEJC6vZaa	It's fine as long at you don't let other people hold him (or make sure they wash their hands really well before they do).  You should also wash your hands after touching something that a lot of other people are touching.<br>  <br>  I'd also leave early if I notice anyone is sick.|`|mGubEYTRaa	Yes, it will be fine.  My best friend brought her two week old to my daughters party last year.  Plus most other kids already have their vaccinations, so they shouldn't have any of those kinds of sicknesses.|`|TAgAnfIbaa	its up to you, but with my two boys i waited 3 to 4 weeks before i took my baby's out. you could always ask your pediatrician to be sure.congrats on your new baby.|`|lGSbjuIuaa	yeah! my sister took her 1 week old to a 2 year olds birthday party! be carefull about who you let hold him! carry disinfectant!|`|LbkLg4RFaa	Sure.  Our son was 2 weeks old when he went to my niece's first birthday.|`|2arZOZWgaa	I think it's fine.  Others will not agree with me.<br>  <br>  I have not vaccinated my children yet. My eldest just had her first birthday party with my two week old present and accounted for. There were plenty of family and friends there and of course I let family hold the new baby (it was sort of his "coming out" party as well). <br>  <br>  Even if your child is on the CDC vaccine schedule, he will not have full immunities for the diseases until he has been through the full series. This could take up to his first year of life (and even then he needs boosters at around age 5 for some). I doubt you will be shielding him from the outside world that long right? Breastfeeding helps protect him from small diseases like flu or common cold, but certainly not pertussis, polio, and the like. Even then breastfeeding isn't 100% effective.<br>  <br>  It's up to you. Since this is probably your first child, you are more protective than usual and that is normal and to be expected. I would hold him back if people there were going to be sick, but not because his was not vaccinated.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I'd get a sling and wear your baby against your chest for the whole party. It will stop people from trying to hold your baby, it will keep all the kids away from your baby, and it will save your arms!
aIjOfkM8aa	Ronald|`|95f7247eb624aa87ba4619aeec8608ccaa	I personally dont like the name ronald.  Reginald is a unique name.  and a cute nick name for it could be Regi!<br>  <br>  Love it!<br>  <br>  <3 Nikkay<br>  Live. Love. Dance.|`|pO0s0bhHaa	I like Ronald.  As a baby you can can him Ronnie then as he gets older he can be Ron. <br>  <br>  I don't like Reginald or the nickname Reggie.  Sorry.|`|wFN8bVqsaa	Ronald McDonald, the McDonald's mascot? No thanks. I really don't like Ronald. I do like Reginald! :)|`|XPWZbyPqaa	i dont like either, but if a had to choose i would say ronald. dont embarras your baby by naming him reginald|`|DnYTMtTkaa	I like Ronald better.|`|CxRJwJsraa	hmm...I'm liking Reginald.|`|S3vYMNzFaa	Ronald!|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Ronald|`|9WovIk3maa	Ronald|`|Vi5SCyr9aa	ronald|`|2TrHH0rkaa	Ronald, at least he can go by the nickname Ron.
FWkLDcqOaa	Well I'm fifteen, and i'm between 5'4 and 5'5.<br>  My weight shifts alot, usually anywhere inbetween 105 and 115, and i'm your normal, basic size. So i guess that's average? ahha.|`|IVqFv4wMaa	hmm well im 15 in a few months.<br>  im 5;8 and 123 pounds and i have a small body frame.<br>  so probably like 110-115??|`|sKmQVwQMaa	95-120
iBjxRpJwaa	Yes, you can. ^ ^<br>  If sperm is anywhere near the opening of the vagina, it can swim up your vagina and fertilize your egg. :3<br>  But, the percentage of sperm surviving through that method is very slim.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	the only virgin (meaning no sex) that got pregnant was Mary.<br>  <br>  you have to have sex with a man (penetratioN) to get pregnant.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Yes. If the sperm somehow enter the vagina without penetration. But I guess that's along the lines of science... which is what baby making is all about.|`|CBVl4Adsaa	you can get the guy to masturbate onto your hand then put the sperm into your vigina. I saw a program where a girl took the condom with the sperm in and put it in without the guy knowning and she was pregnant with his baby, which I think was kinda sly|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	Seems really strange to me that Mary wasn't having sex with her own husband, to get pregnant. Why was that? Religion doesn't make any sense. At all.<br>  You need sperm to get pregnant, which means that you need to have sex to get pregnant.|`|kT7GVOosaa	with the virgin mary yes but not the other. the thing that makes christ birth a miricle is that Mary was a vergin. however that was an act of god and cant really happen to any of us. you need to have sex to get pregnant.|`|cQaHukqUaa	no i don't think so. you need intercourse for pregnancy to happen.|`|tcJzBpmaaa	I'm fairly certain that "The Virgin Queen" did not have any children (if I remember my history correctly).It was a nickname but not necessarily true (and had nothing to do with children).  The Virgin Mary question is for Theologians to answer (non-Christians don't believe this one).  <br>  As for "pregnancy without sex"  -- that is now possible WITH science (artificial insemination) but not without.|`|a67f223481e1f00da8ea5d7d5f8d576caa	You need to have sex or the transfer of sperm to the egg.  I can happen, though rarely, without sex if there is sexual activity.  It CANNOT happen without sperm.<br>  <br>  Virgin Mary was given the gift of child by God for the purpose of sending Jesus to save His people.<br>  <br>  I believe Queen Elizabeth had lovers so why they called her a virgin is beyond me.  I am sure there is a reason but I could not tell you without researching.|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	Virgin mary didnt have sex to get preg which is y she was called the virgin marry. Can it happen now? No!! Do u need to have sex to get pregnant...YES! Do you need to be having sex...ABSOLUTELY NOT!! Especially if u have  to ask a question like  that!|`|OF1mqEuiaa	Yes, but that's vitro fertilization (Something like that). You choose to get pregnant through that though.|`|qnU1HS1aaa	Sounds like you need to study sex ed.|`|YcLnaUo1aa	no you cant get prego without sex|`|JSBPfpjtaa	with sperm injection yes

It's a fun way to unwind with some buddies for a little while when you can't be together, which is how I played it. I also know some people who have five or six level 80s and spend several hours a day playing...those people are nerds.<br>  <br>  I don't like MMOs unless I'm with a group of buddies. Otherwise I'd rather just play a single-player game with a deeper story.<br>  <br>  EDIT: WoW doesn't screw up families any more than liquor stores do. A balanced, healthy person can play video games in moderation with no ill effects. People with problems will end up messed up somehow; through video game addiction, alcoholism, whatever.

kprKXEOSaa	This book, "Fertility, Cycles & Nutrition" by Marilyn Shannon, has a chapter in improving male fertility.<br>  A couple things I've heard, the first is vitamin C, and the other is to have him eat lots of tomatoes, like spaghetti and things like that.<br>  The vitamin C actually improves the quality of the semen, not necessarily the sperm, so improvement can be measured quickly, whereas improvements to the sperm take about 90 days to be measured, since that is the approximate time it takes for sperm to be produced--you know, their life cycle is about 90 days, although new sperm are being made and released constantly.<br>  The supplement he's taking probably has vitamin C, selenium, zinc, vitamin A, and B vitamins (including folic acid).  Fatty acids are also good, like flax oil.<br>  When my husband and I were going to through infertility treatments, I made him take vitamin C, even though there wasn't anything wrong with his fertility.  I figured if his fertility was 110%, it could help compensate for my under-average fertility.  <br>  Beyond that, I would say that common sense is always good.  Healthy diet, plenty of pure water.  Boxers, not briefs, and no tight pants; no hot tubbing, and no lap top on the lap.  (Heat can damage the sperm.)  <br>  And make sure he knows you still think he's sexy, and don't just think of him as a sperm donor.  <br>  Good luck!|`|yp9rEMSraa	I heard in one of my fertility book cinnamon helps...|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	I heard about natural  juice best of luck>>>>..|`|obN6p3Cgaa	Try fertility .com wish you luck******

Me and my DH BD 1/26; 2/3-4; 2/13; 2/23-2/24; 2/28. I wasn't paying attention to CM, temps etc for fear of another<br>  let do. So when the 20th came and nothing, 22nd and nothing I wasn't<br>  to concerned since I'm irregular. So on the 28th I had some cramping<br>  and spotting, then i passed a small clot, (tmi) so I said ok my period. Long story short by Sat there was no blood and I had milky white cm. I tested on that day BFN (2/28) BFN again (3/3). So then I started to worry! So by the 5th nothing. I decided to re-test, afterall it was the DH <br>  BDaY.. BFP!! 5 days after the spotting. I re-tested again the next day BFP again.

fZGcufB7aa	Hannah Claire- Adorable! I think this name is absolutely gorgeous. It flows perfectly. I love it.<br>  <br>  Allison Rose- This is another beautiful name. I love the name Allison because you can call her Allie. That's so adorable. Allison Rose goes together very nicely.<br>  <br>  Claire Rose- No. This name doesn't flow right at all. I like Claire as a first name though. I think Claire Allison would sound better. Sice Claire is only one syllable you shouldn't have a one syllable middle name. <br>  <br>  Alyson Claire- Gorgeous. I love it a lot. The only thing that I would change it the spellig of Alyson to Allison. The ame goes together bery well. I like it a lot.<br>  <br>  My favorite name was probably Hannah Claire and my least favorite was Claire Rose.<br>  <br>  Dylan Parker (called Parker)-I think it flows very nicely, but since you are going to call him Parker why not just name him Parker Dylan. I do think Dylan Parker flows better though.<br>  <br>  Kyle Parker (Parker)- Same as above. I don't love the name Kyle though. It just seems a little old to me. I don't know why though.

Way better than the other crap that you see these days. :) And congrats on the twins. You must be very excited. I wish you luck, lol. <br>  <br>  Hannah Claire - I love the name Hannah, and the name Claire. Together, the flow just isn't right, and it's pretty plain with the name Claire as the middle name. Not a bad name though.<br>  <br>  Allison Rose - Allison and Rose are both nice names, but today, are used way too much. Pick a name that she wouldn't just be another Allison with. Pick something more unique, like Adilee. I bet she doesn't know another with her same name.<br>  <br>  Claire Rose - Way too short and plain -- a very simple name. Claire as a first name lacks needed personality. I know the personality is in the kid, but it's way too plain.<br>  <br>  Alyson Claire - Nice combination. I don't however like your spelling of Allison. Alison Claire, or Allison Claire are really pretty though.<br>  <br>  Dylan Parker (called Parker) - I love the name Dylan. Parker is a really great name too. I love this name; everything about it. However, naming him Dylan and calling him Parker? Why not just let his first name be Parker, and his middle name Dylan? I don't like this idea very much..<br>  <br>  Kyle Parker (Parker) - Again, I would prefer if the name that you plan on calling your son be the name that you give him. I like Kyle, but I much prefer the previous option. Both very nice names though.<br>  <br>  Benjamin James (Ben) - I like how you plan on calling him in accordance to his first name, but I don't like it very much -- way too common. Nice flow though.<br>  <br>  Best Girl Name(s):<br>  1) Allison Claire<br>  2) Hannah Claire<br>  3) Allison Rose<br>  4) Claire Rose<br>  <br>  Best Boy Name(s):<br>  1) Dylan Parker<br>  2) Kyle Parker<br>  3) Benjamin James<br>  <br>  Best Girl Name(s) w/ Mix&&Match:<br>  1) Allison Claire<br>  2) Allison Rose<br>  3) Hannah Rose<br>  4) Hannah Claire<br>  5) Roselyn Claire<br>  <br>  Best Boy Name(s) w/ Mix&&Match:<br>  1) Parker James<br>  2) Parker Dylan <br>  3) Parker Benjamin<br>  4) Benjamin Parker<br>  5) Kyle Benjamin<br>  <br>  All of the names are very nice.

c73QkZ2haa	If it was clogged there would be constant leaking. Its probably eye snot. Get a washcloth damp and wipe from inside to the out. You should do this every morning. Babies get sleep in their eyes too..May also be a touch of pink eye... If it concerns you though speak to your doctor.<br>  <br>  <br>  One of the symptoms of tear duct obstruction is excessive tearing. The tears run down the face because they cannot go down the tear duct. Mucous, normally secreted by the eye, also does not go down the duct like it should, so it dries about the eye giving it a crusty appearance, or it collects in the eyelashes, often matting the eyelid shut. Occasionally, bacteria build up in the clogged duct causing an infection requiring antibiotic drops.|`|ACOsW9ytaa	glob?|`|7J3SMZXcaa	this is nothing to worry about. it's a blocked tear duct, and totally normal. My little one had it off and on for the first three months of her life. Just use a wet paper towel to wipe it away (I chose to wipe up), and you can use your index finger to massage between his nose and eye for about a minute or two here and there throughout the day. This will help the tear duct unclogg. <br>  <br>  In the mornings it would be so bad, sometimes my little one's eye would be caked shut with dried stuff-but I would just use the wet napkin or cotton ball to wipe it away.<br>  <br>  If the whites of his eyes are not pinked or bloodshot, it is not and infection. And unlike what has been said by others-a clogged duct does not always happen immediately when born. It could be that his eyes are tearing up more than before, and now it is appearing. if really concerned, definitely call your ped.|`|MavosJHYaa	It would have been constantly watering and gunky for the last 4 months if it were a clogged tear duct. It is probably a regular old eye infection. He may need antibiotic eye drops. Try washing his eye several times a day with a warm wash cloth, if it doesn't go away after a day or two more, go to the doctor and get the antibiotic eye drops to clear it up.
QzWHMGHJaa	Look you made a big deal over a little rash, your Dr tried to give you an answer, it was a guess, it satisfied you at the time, it was just a little rash just like what he gets now, at this point you're being ridiculous about it, feed him one food at a time, then if he has a reaction you'll know it.  why put him through unnecessary testing?|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i think u need to have those 'little rashes' looked at when you haven't had nuts and go from there....it is possible that he is allergic and didn't react the first time, but it sounds to me that something else is going on....he may just have sensitive skin.....|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	If you have a "first degree" relative with severe atopic disease, or your son has persistent reflux (sometimes a sign of an allergy), or you think his rashes are eczema its possible beneficial to do some RAST blood testing for allergies -but more importantly to speak to an allergist (or do your own research, not every doctor is equally good)<br>  <br>  Its just as possible he has sensitive skin that reacts to perfumes, dust, etc.<br>  <br>  I know I react to some cleaner that they use in certain malls because I would get this rash all over my face, and it mainly happened on days the cleaning crew came in the night before.|`|K3FuGAdOaa	trust your mother's instincts. if you think you need to do that do it. i know i would and dont listen to people who obviously dont care about your concerns regarding your child. So what if the dr's answer did not satisfy you all the way...your the mom do what you think is best. dr's know alot but do not know it all trust your instincts!!! good luck|`|y8d38Sbgaa	No don't get him tested.  Just wait a few days between foods to be sure of no allergies.  My baby had lots of rashes on her face - they came and went for no reason.<br>  Hang in there.<br>  Lisa
prqrQcd1aa	I think it depends on the age of the child honestly. If you are use to a certain way of living, and then things change, such as a parent looses a job, you loose your house, and things like that , that have been happening, i think it's important to let older children know about things like this are going on. That way so many things don't come as a surprise. <br>  Sometimes the best and easiest way to teach a child the value of a dollar, and how to budget is to sit them down and show them your bills and the money you have coming into the household! (like i say, when they are older..say like 16 or so!)|`|AkFag8tNaa	If you (parents and kids) are about to undergo a huge life change due to your financial cirumstances, then of course you need to let them know why. If you're scrimping for the rent but are gonna be alright, I second housemom, don't burden them.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Absolutely not. The only way I can see this is if you lost your home and became homeless. Kids do not need to be burdened with adult problems and worry over things that the parents should be taking care of, IMO.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	It depends by what you mean by "children."  I don't think young children need to be worrying about that kind of stuff, but into the teens I do think they should know.  By that age they should know how lucky they are for the things their parents give them-- even if it's not as much as they wanted, and not having any idea what financial situation my parents had made planning for college a giant hassle.  I'd go to my adviser and he'd ask, "well, could your parents be approved for a loan?"  And I would have to answer "uhhhhhh I dunno?" and they couldn't help me very much without me having any information to work with.|`|vGxipYJnaa	We're fortunate not to have any financial worries - but I would never discuss that kind of stuff with our kids either way. My parents never indicated how much money they had and I think that was the best way to go. I think as a teen you'd be able to kind of figure out where your family stands financially.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	no ..life is rough ..learn it|`|CTE2eRgZaa	I think there should be a sense of financial situation.  Like that mommy and daddy are trying to save money right now.  Depending on the age of the children, more or less can be shared.<br>  <br>  13 and under should understand that we're saving.<br>  <br>  Older than that, they need to know.  Otherwise, you'll either incur more debt trying to lie to them, or make them angry at you.<br>  <br>  My parents aren't straight with me, and i'm in college.  I don't know that if i don't get a summer job, do they have spending money to give.<br>  <br>  Keeping children in the dark makes them scared|`|6Z4fKZ8aaa	I think it's important for kids to know about their parent's financial situation because it's better to tell them the truth then lie to them. My family was almost homeless when I was 14 years old back in 2001 (my mom, my stepfather, my sister, me, and my unborn sister) because of financial issues that my mother and stepfather chose not to tell me or my younger sister about.  You should never lie to your children about anything. It's better to be honest and straightforward with them. If you lie to them about this important issue in their lives, and whether you see it or not; IT DOES AFFECT THEM; how do you expect your children to ever be truthful and honest with you, if your going to lie to them?|`|DDFSITiYaa	Financial information is intensely personal and private information, for only those with a 'need to know'.  I did not know what my father's income was until after he died. <br>  <br>  I would say, no, it is not to be shared.  If you are worried about it, then you can ask for a serious discussion with your parents where perhaps the overall gist of the situation might be talked about but without details.|`|n6NJ1e2daa	I don't know. I think it certainly depends on the age of the child. My parents tell me what's going on, but then again, I'm 15. I watch the news with them when we eat dinner every night, so it's not like I don't know. I wouldn't tell a younger kid, though. They don't need to be burdened with all of this adult stuff. They just need to be happy and enjoy being kids. Growing up comes fast.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	Well id depends how much. I would never tell them how much I make ect. but if we are in a bind I would tell them so and they cannot have the luxuries they previously had. Its only fair to tell them so they understand why they cant have that PS3 or whatever they wanted that is not necessary. I would also tell them, if they are old enough. To go and find a job so they can pay for it them selves. If they aren't create jobs like mowing the lawn for money. I did that and I got paid 30 bucks for it.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I agree with housemom.  I think the worst part about being an adult is the burden of having to deal with money.  I hate the importance of money.  However, I do try to teach my children the value of a dollar.  I don't want them to think we poop golden turds or find it on trees in the backyard.|`|98qMZZPlaa	YES!  They are aware of everything.  No sheltering from anything in my household especially money.  I want them to be aware, so they do not make the same mistakes and can hopefully live a better (financially ) life than we do now.|`|VygBNA0Waa	yes because you try and protect your children and some adults cant handle the stress so how could a  teenager handle the worry when they dont have to|`|4oqDhdYJaa	yes try to keep it to yourselves.children dont need to worry about that stuff it will be their turn time enough.i never knew whether we were rich or poor years ago in the eighties when we were poor. my mam has told us years later about problems with money but we never knew and were allowed to enjoy our childhood,in saying that we were often told we cant afford that but it wasnt a big deal.|`|ZfNCkHllaa	kids dont need to worry about financial situations. thats the parents problem. <br>  let kids be kids..|`|FqXIwIHLaa	Children should not have to worry about finances.

I swallowed enough Tylenol that my kidney's were already starting to shut down. The doctors told me I had about 48 hours to live, if I were going to survive. And, clearly, I did survive. I'm very happy I did. I cannot believe how selfish I was when I was 18. I can't imagine, now that I'm a parent, putting my family through that, especially my children.<br>  <br>  I'm glad I didn't succeed and that I got help.

So i don't think he was ever happy after that.|`|S4y7V4diaa	I have tried to many times. The last time I had to go to the ER. I think my mom is still really really hurt.

weu4Ip99aa	OMG you are very smart! THANK YOU for being responsible! Yes its normal for your periods to be out of whack when for about a year after you start. Yeah it might be a good idea to go on the pill... have you talked to your mom about it? You can go see a dr. and he/she will tell you which pill is best for you by seeing how your body is and stuff... =)|`|88cf073c1a10431f8f96825fd98241e8aa	I think once you get your period it should be relatively regular. I think you should definitely talk to your Mom about it and ask her to take you to a Gynecologist who can run a few tests and see whats going on and weather you might need some medication. He will also be able to advice you better than people on yahoo answers about BC Pills. Im sure your mother will take you just to make sure you are ok if you tell her about your problem with your period. Good luck|`|z2KBZbK0aa	talk to the doctor about it|`|m6GveN68aa	honestly, the pill is unnatural and you are better off staying off of it.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	The best way to go about it is to talk with you doctor. They will help you choose a pill (triphasic vs monophasic) and be able to check out your reproductive system to ensure that all is well as you are having very irregular periods.|`|c55O7jqXaa	You need to have a gyn appointment before doing this and also one size does not fit all meaning you may have to try it and see how well you do on it.
vGxipYJnaa	I want her to be left alone, too. Our daughter loves Dora and someday she will outgrow her and that's how it should be! I don't think an older Dora will appeal to older girls anyway. She's sort of dorky and cute which is great for a preschooler or young kid, but she probably won't be cool for adolescents.|`|6Z4fKZ8aaa	No I think she's fine. She's turning into a whore. I can't believe they are so concerned with ratings that they'll make her grow up just to impress the tweens/teenage girls.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Yea hasn't she explored enough?

X9T9iVVhaa	Blair and Blake are cute for girls!<br>  I don't like Merritt very much though.|`|ildgJVJoaa	None of them really do anything for me, but they are original and could work. If you're using Merritt, however, spell it with either one r and two t's or one two r's and one t (Merrit or Meritt).|`|61NKzPzMaa	Nope<br>  <br>  Blair and Blake are masculine BOYS names.

723QHuicaa	Yes - I have lost 2 babies, and I threatened loss of my daughter many times.<br>  <br>  Right up till I was in labour - without drs care, my daughter would not be here either. She was an emergency section and I was minutes away from losing her. Im so blessed she is here with me.<br>  <br>  I dont mean to knock anyone who declines medical attention - but given my past history while pregnant, it would be silly, selfish and irresponsible of me not to seek medical care when pregnant.|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	It was routine care and urine tests that caught my pre-eclampsia.  I had no idea that anyhting was wrong until my (at that point) weekly appt. when my they picked up that my blood pressure was REALLY high and I had protein in my urine.  So, yes, I think it is very important.  Who knows what would have happened to my baby or myself without it!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i think it is ignorance, laziness, and lack of care on the mother's part personally....she's just not worried about the health and care of her unborn baby; probably the same mom that smokes two packs a day, does drugs, etc. and is afraid to go bc she might get caught  or something...|`|wENdWT5kaa	I 100% agree with Soph's mum. I don't know what DYOT is on, but medical care is VERY VERY IMPORTANT during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  With out routine check ups, my doctor would have never had found out that i had placenta privia . And get this DYOT, i was NOT "high risk" , wow, shocking, huh. <br>  <br>  Now if she never found out about it, i don't know if my son or even I would be here right now. <br>  <br>  So, yes, despite what DYOT claimes and that long winded babble that Mystic pasted, it is very necessary and important.|`|DNygQdmVaa	I think doctor care is very important.<br>  I had my son at 24 weeks and if I hadn't been in a hospital with a doctor when i delivered him he wouldnt of lived.<br>  <br>  And yay! my son started high 5ing at like 12 months.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	those people have no sense.|`|Grmsgziaaa	My SIL and I are both Americans living in Mexico. We were both pregnant at the same time. I used a doctor here in Mexico and she had midwife visits over the phone. She would take piss tests everymonth herself and call the midwife with results. She would go to clinics and get the bloodwork done when needed. She got 1 ultrasound done the whole time because she thinks ultrasounds are the devil. She had her baby at home with a midwife and her mother.<br>  <br>   I on the otherhand visited my doctor every month, and had my baby in a hospital by emergency c section. Without ultrasounds my baby would have died, I wasnt yet overdue and my daughter wasnt recieving anything from my placenta.<br>  <br>  I think it is possible and very common that you go and nothing ever happens to you at all and you feel that it was worthless, but an hour of your time a month to ensure a healthy baby isnt much to ask is it? It is possible to have a healthy baby and not recieve care, but what happens if there is somthing wrong with the baby.<br>  <br>  In the end, it is a personal desision and a risk.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	I completely agree with prenatal care. THANKFULLY I had a very pleasant and healthy pregnancy and delivery, however I was told that I am RH Negative, which could severely effect my child at birth causing blood transfusions. Fortunately based on my blood type they were able to determine this and give me the proper medical care to prevent any complications with my daughter's blood after she was born.<br>  <br>  The stress put on doctor's and nurses when a mother comes in with no medical information or history must be insane. It's like my job as a dispatcher... sending an officer to an address where supposedly a fight is taking place, but I have no information on suspects, weapons etc. <br>  <br>  Help yourself, your baby, and the health care professionals and suck up the copay. Plus you pay the doctor for the delivery beforehand so that takes stress away from most of your medical bills AFTER having the baby.|`|JP2h62qiaa	I think it is STUPID to refuse care from a doctor, nurse or midwife during your pregnancy.<br>     Wouldn't someone want to be reassured that nothing was wrong with their child?? Or in the case that something was wrong the doctors would be prepared for it at birth. MY son came by emergancy c-section too, he was jaundiced and had meconium all in his lungs.Some people are just a few french fries short of a happy meal man...But it is alright, it is their life to live, thankfully. Not mine : ]<br>   <br>   FYI.Mystic doesn't always give out those long annoying copy and pastes....I like her. She could however just copy the Link and paste that to save all the scrolling down.    No drama please, this wasn't intended to put ANY BODY down. Like I said I LIKE mystic and she has actually typed out some real comforting words and advice to me before.|`|XOtOMncwaa	I think doctor care, or some kind of care is very important. There can be numerous things go wrong during a pregnancy and people would never know without a doctor. I think people like that are crazy, and I hate to name call, but it's true. I don't understand why people would want to put their babies lives at risk for their pleasure... <br>  But anyways you should watch "Free Birthing" if you can catch it on TV, if you find that interesting. It's about woman who have no doctor care and deliver their babies on their own without a doctor. My chin was literally on the floor the whole time I watched it.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I can't understand it either.<br>  <br>  My sister lost her first baby.  Then when she was pregnant with my niece almost lost her too.  She went for her scan at 34 weeks, and had to have her by c-section that night as the placenta was failing and there was almost no amniotic fluid around my niece.  It was literally life or death.  So my niece was born 2lbs 3oz, and if my sister had gone without ultrasounds no one would have known anything about it.<br>  <br>  With my pregnancy I had bleeding early on, so needed an extra ultrasound .  I then developed pre eclampsia in the last trimester, again, if I hadn't bothered seeing a midwife I wouldn't have know about this, and me and my son might not be here.<br>  <br>  It just doesn't make sense to me.  By the way, in the UK (where I am) if your pregnancy is low risk you only see the doctor once or twice, it's normally midwife-led care, as they're really highly trained in the UK.<br>  <br>  <br>  *****<br>  Oh, Soph's mum, you had SPD too?  I feel your pain, literally!<br>  <br>  DYOT, I wasn't in ANY of your "high risk categories" and I had a crap pregnancy.  Just because yours ran smoothly and the tests were all clear for you doesn't make it the same for everyone.  Wouldn't you rather we were all safe than sorry?|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I know someone who declines medical treatment at any point - including the birth. Her youngest 2 were 'free birthed' (without even a midwife present) at home.<br>  She said that the body knows what to do, having midwives interfere mess with the body's natural rythmn etc...<br>  I can see the reasoning, but still think it's pretty damn stupid and irresponsible. Especially for a first child, that's just crazy.<br>  Live and let live!<br>  ETA - 'Do Your Own Thinking'.. It benefits drug users, yet there was no point in you seeing a doctor or midwife??<br>  Ok.... that's not a contradiction at all...<br>  Wow, another copy/pasted answer from mystic_eye... what a shocker, huh....(?!)|`|XTuhGaL1aa	Personally, I would always use the latest technology (if no harm to my unborn baby) to ensure a safe and healthy pregnancy. If I didn't I wouldn't have known my daughter had a cyst on her ovary, I was tested positive for GBS, had high blood pressure and had to be induced because of it. <br>  <br>  Home births are another story. Why would someone refuse medical care at such a crucial time? I guess I am just asking the same question as you are... I never understood it either.|`|JQZDCcyQaa	This has turned into something very nasty, why cant everybody just agree that everyone has different opinions.<br>  My opinion is that I have given birth in a hospital, and I had a relatively easy pregnancy, and maybe next time I would consider having it at home with a doula or midwife, but I would never do it alone, but by all means if women feel the need and things go smoothly then good for them|`|d9f20f541b11cd50f467c781308cd1e8aa	yes, i think its important. There are things that are life threatening that cant be tested for at home.|`|5IlaGPxUaa	If i hadnt have done the routine visits and Pee test they would not have found that i had Protein in my urine along with my VERY hgh blood pressure and all my swelling...<br>  <br>  I hadnt even heard of Preeclampsia so i thought swelling was normal... So personally it was a blessing that i went to every appointment or they wouldnt have picked it up...<br>  <br>  Plus During my labour and my birth it was so quick and i was so scared that the fact that midwifes as well as my partner were reassuring me the whole way that it was normal helped my mental state lol... I was so terrified lol<br>  <br>  Also i had so much tearing and stitches and lost a lot of blood... If i was at home i would have prob lost more and been left all torn....<br>  <br>  Hmmm anyhow that is just me|`|a1731418e68343f01ae82b7c12846cf2aa	I can understand wanting to have control over your own pregnancy and delivery, but not everyone can have that.  There are conditions that are silent, potentionally fatal for mom and/or baby, and are caught with routine prenatal care.  Maybe a lot of women don't need to go as frequently as called for, but I wouldn't write of prenatal care all together.  But, to each their own....<br>  <br>  I think it's laughable that not breastfeeding your child is "selfish" but going without prenatal care isn't to some of these women.|`|dW4DbkCLaa	It's a personal choice but in my option dr. care is important in pregnancy. I was dealing with high blood pressure and edema and it was good to know my blood pressure and have that urine sample to check for protein. I completely understand why moms choose the natural route though. Dr.s can be very impersonal and make all these decisions that you didn't want while you are in labor. A lot of times they push C-sections just because they want to get home to eat dinner or something. It's ridiculous. It really all depends on each women's individual situation.|`|f4HsyUfQaa	OK! Coming from the point of view. I think everyone woman who becomes pregnant should have professional medical care while she's pregnant. Either a nurse, homeopathic doctor, naturopathic doctor, medical doctor, or a midwife. It's important to have some with the medical knowledge to monitor your pregnancy to make sure you receiving the best care. If you have it available to you.. I say USE IT! I think anyone who refuses to seek out professional care for their unborn baby/babies is just plain stupid (imo). why risk having an unhealthy baby? It may be intrusive, but it's the best thing you can do for you and your baby.|`|hXlMvVfWaa	Prenatal care saved my son. I had a miscarriage and didn't know I was Rh negative. When I got pregnant with my second baby it was determined I was Rh sensitized which made me high risk (no - I'm not a drug user or a teenager) and I was watched very closely. Eventually, my baby needed an in utero blood transfusion to save his life. It did. You'll never convince me the outcome would have been the same had I not had prenatal care. I would have never known I was Rh negative or Rh sensitized. They don't make home test kits for that...|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I think it was important for myself.  I am diabetic, with hypertension.  So I had to have ultrasounds to make sure the baby wasn't getting too big, I had to do urine testing to make sure there wasn't a lot of protein present in my urine, I had to have monthly A1C testing to keep track of my sugars, and I needed weekly meetings with my doctor to make sure my insulin was working correctly and discuss any troubles that i was having, such as extreme lows, and highs which could cause trouble for the baby.<br>  <br>  So yes, for a person with my health background...it is important.  For a healthy person with no problems, it is still important because things can happen...like gestational diabetes.  If you are not receiving care, you would really risk your own health and your babies.  <br>  <br>  People who choose not to receive care are selfish in my opinion.<br>  <br>  I think DYOT is on crack.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I did use a midwife but have been reading on exactly this issue. The women that do this often trust there own instincts and do seek medical care if they have a feeling that something just isn't right. I do know a woman that had previously declined ultrasounds then about 25wks into the pregnancy just had a feeling that something wasn't right. She was right and her baby had a birth defect that required c-section delivery to survive, vaginal delivery would have been deadly.<br>  <br>  A lot of the routine tests done have risks either physically or emotionally even though they can be beneficial.  It's important to trust your gut insticts no matter which way you decide to go. Mother always knows better than any doctor.
s3OkLl8zaa	Yes definitely. I was 14stone and my periods were happening every 3 months if I was lucky & then I would have it for 2 Weeks straight. I lost quite alot of weight and got down to 10 stone 7lbs and my periods were every 30 days bang on. I did conceive in that time but lost baby unfortunately but being healthy is better for your body. I have pcos so its not easy for me to conceive naturally but I got it once so fingers crossed. Good luck with your healthy eating plan xxxxx|`|WIQhh62Zaa	Being overweight and eating badly, just as being underweight, can cause your periods to become irregular.  I was always average but since my daughter was born I have become rather overweight.  Either way, my cycles have always been regular.  I am now starting a healthy eating plan with the help of a natural health/nutritionist.  This should help lose some weight.  If I haven't gotten pregnant this month (AF is due within the next 3 days), then hopefully the healthy eating and vitamins, etc will help with my fertility.|`|fSXb94ARaa	Yes, most definitely weight influences my cycle. I'm overweight and actually losing weight before my husband and I start to get really active in trying to conceive. The more weight I lose and the more active I become/healthier I eat, the more my cycles regulate themselves.
1z3C0R2Vaa	Yes those are some of the sign you can take a test.........|`|a67f223481e1f00da8ea5d7d5f8d576caa	Yes, they can be pregnancy symptoms but they could be hormonal interruption from your lack of consistency.  Are you late yet?  Take a test and you will know.  Be sure it is not to early to get a response.  Make sure you are a couple days late first, is my opinion.
6YLOrGCdaa	Even though I love the song "Hey there Delilah" by the Plain White Tees, two things have ruined this name for me forever.<br>  1. Delilah is a character in the Bible who is pretty well-known for seducing Samson, convincing him to cut his hair (the source of his strength), and getting him imprisoned - all by lying and deceiving a man who loved her. Seems like quite the impression to stick a little kid with, no?<br>  2. There is a really annoying DJ on Kosi 101 who is named Delilah. The first is a bigger deal, though!<br>  For a close name, you could try Delia (I think it's a flower). <br>  Good luck!|`|P9zJmmcMaa	Love it BUT it makes me think of that awful night-time DJ, and we have a strip club here named Delilah's.|`|wdXQaATDaa	I don't like it..sorry!|`|DNygQdmVaa	I like that name. its very cute.|`|w5y4BTjkaa	The name sounds like it would belong to a sweet person with lots of hope. It sounds like she will accomplish something in her life and make those around her feel warm and welcome. It sounds like she will be kind, caring person who is giving and determined. It sounds like she will be a mannerable, polite girl with lots of character and she will be well-loved by those around her. It sounds good on the type of person who is full of joy and beauty. It's very feminine and delicate! I love it!<br>  <br>  Deliliah means One who is Weakened and is of Hebrew origin. And I LOVE the song 'Hey there Delilh' by the Plain White Tee's! The whole name flows very well and smooth, too. I hope I helped!<br>  <br>  Always,<br>  (-:Tabbykinz:-)|`|781d71752d258090b69b654451d07ecfaa	I think it is pretty. I think, as someone who has a 3 sylable name that it's good to be able to shorten the name, I dont know if you can for this one. I named my cat Delilah after the song. :)|`|dnGJ5JLgaa	I love that name!  It is very pretty, cute and unique!  It is such a beautiful name.  <br>  What is the middle name?|`|Vi5SCyr9aa	really pretty name ruined by a stupid song|`|j2C4riJlaa	HIDEOUS!!

Fd4lITkvaa	I can't answer all of your questions but I do know that I have periods without ovulation. It's completely possible that the doctor is correct. I had to take birth control then stop it to stimulate ovulation when I got pregnant with my son.|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	What made him/her say that you weren't going to ovulate this cycle?  Did he/she do a vaginal ultrasound or a bloodtest?  An ultrasound would have shown a maturing follicle on cd17 if you think you should have ovulated on cd20.  It is possible to have your period (either on time or late) and not ovulate that cycle.|`|obN6p3Cgaa	May be he or she was wrong this time.

E2e485WRaa	You really should make an effort to eat some vegetables.  Vegetables have other vitamins that fruit does not have and less sugar.  You really should make an effort to have at least 2 servings of veggies a day.  <br>  <br>  You can snack on raw veggies: carrots, red peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc........  you can dip them in hummus, ranch dressing, tzatziki sauce, cheese fondue..... <br>  <br>  You can eat raw baby spinach.  Use it as your leaves (instead of regular lettuce) in salads or on burgers etc...  It is good this way.  It tastes nothing like cooked spinach.

dPULl5hjaa	Lora Ann<br>  Leah Grace<br>  Henry Lee<br>  <br>  All perfect names!|`|zbjaBgyEaa	Lora and Leah are too similar in my opinion.  They're both short (four letters long EACH), and they start and end in the same sounds.  They're too close for siblings in my opinion.  Me and my sister have names that both start with 'n' and one of the biggest insecurities I had growing up was the fact that, despite the fact that we were VERY dissimilar, nobody could keep us straight because of our similar names.  It was frustrating always getting called by my sister's name - it got to be so common people stopped caring and correcting themselves when they did.  It was annoying, confusing and irritating.  I'd highly suggest AVOIDING it.  Grace is lovely, but Leah has to go in my opinion.  Something like Aliyah or Ayla Grace would be close to her style while avoiding the rhymey name syndrome.<br>  <br>  Henry I like.  Lee I'm not keen on.  But whatever.|`|6YLOrGCdaa	Not a giant fan of the name Leah - it is a weak-eyed, ugly girl in the Bible (a reference most educated, if not religious, people will get). Henry Lee seems like quite a lot to saddle a youngster with - it's nice, but it reminds me of a Confederate general. It would look nice on a name-plate as a CEO, though!<br>  I'd say I'm lukewarm on both, but I don't hate them. <br>  Congrats to your friend!|`|6nUprmu5aa	I love them. I love old fashioned names(you can by Lucille's name)! They are unusual and uncommon today. Everyone does not have that name. That little girl will be the only kid in her class with it. Henry, maybe not but it's still not common.|`|nZVmkZSBaa	Lora Ann isn't that bad, but it isn't very unique or original. It is a rather common, simple, and a pretty bland name overall. Let's just say, I would never in a million years name my daughter that. A name should have personality, and Lora Ann.. Doesn't. :]<br>  <br>  Nothing against your friend or her kids, but her children's name are not very.. What's the word.. Good. :)<br>  <br>  Leah Grace is nice. By far better than the other two. I would consider this child very blessed not to have been burdened with such names as her siblings. Lol. No offense, but the others sound like names of the elderly. I wouldn't want my kids having names of that sort. I actually like Leah, not TOO common, but common nonetheless. Leah Grace is nice, and has loads more personality than the other two. :]<br>  <br>  Henry Lee, well, I'm sure people will be aware of how the name was derived -- it's an old people's name. I would seriously bring up other suggestions. It's pretty horrid to be quite honest.<br>  <br>  Lora Ann:<br>  Ann is just okay. Lora is horribly misspelled. I much prefer Laura, as the spelling. But, as long as she likes it, nobody else really matters. Right?<br>  <br>  Leah Grace:<br>  Nice name. I don't see anything wrong with this name in particular. She did a much better job her, Lol. Leah is just adorable. And Grace isn't that bad. :D<br>  <br>  Henry Lee:<br>  Just NO. Horrible name. Lee isn't bad as the middle name. I would much prefer it with Justin, though. <br>  <br>  I did notice a pattern with her names(don't worry, it isn't anything good). Lol. All of her chosen middle names are merely filler names. Ann, Lee, Grace -- I don't like how she did that at all. Should have given something much more fun && creative. Oh well. Her children; her names.<br>  <br>  Congrats to your friend. <br>  Good luck. -x-|`|dnGJ5JLgaa	Lora Ann.  Why didn't she spell it the right way Laura?<br>  Anyways, it is a very common name (Lora and Leah)<br>  but I do like Leah Grace even if everybody has that name.<br>  Henry Lee.  I like the first name Henry.  BUt not Lee.  Henry Lee and Lora Ann sound very old fashioned and too alike.|`|pl7lWGZDaa	I love the name Leah Grace! Henry is a cute name, but I personally don't like it paired with Lee. I would go for a more traditional name if she's picking Henry...William, Thomas, Matthew, James....|`|t7HUMcOCaa	I really love the name Leah Grace.<br>  If she wants something a little different, suggest Aleah. I have a good friend named Aleah, and it's really cute to me. :D Leah Grace is pretty though.|`|c26378b0778c0dc5452f0b109171dba5aa	there is nothing wrong with either name. People forget the children have to live with the name given to them for life. Whether they are stupid or nice. I have seen some really screwed up names, poor kids.<br>  These are really nice.
62hGVNhoaa	Bottle stalls are always popular, get people to donate bottles (check with the headteacher if alcohol is ok) stick one side of a raffle ticket to the bottles and the other in a bucket, anyone pulling a ticket ending in a 5 or 0 wins the matching prize. Cheap multipacks of juice are good to split and bulk out the stall.<br>  We had good sales with a chocolate fountain and fruit kebab stall, sell the kebabs and let them dip them into the fountain.|`|69b91f42927e8e3de27734e3a92e06f6aa	At my daughter school fete, the one stall that gets the kids flocking around is the lucky dip. If you get a few boxes of choc bars or cheap bags of sweets (pref wholesale so cheaper) wrap them up and fill a drum or bin with shredded paper the kids love delving in and unwrapping what they have. There is never enough in there and the stall is the 1st to close as it is so busy. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  PS. Chucking wet sponges at a teacher always goes down well too ;-)

BW7Nrqjzaa	There really is nothing you can do until the baby is ready but here's the list I give my mom's to be:<br>  -Walking, walking, walking... If it's cold were you are go to the mall and and try not to smack people staring at your humongous belly and asking you annoying questions like-"Are you having triplets??" Or just walk around your house, I like walking up and down the stairs for some reason.<br>  -Try doing some squatting exercises. If you have a birthing ball-Great! If not try squatting while holding onto the edge of your bed or the couch. Just remember that your balance is really funny right now. You might want to surround yourself with some pillows just in case. Even just sitting on the toilet can help.<br>  -Try and get some raspberry tea, raspberry leaf tea is even better, but harder to find. It'll help tone your uterus.<br>  -Evening Primrose Oil, it contains chemicals similar to prostaglandins that help ripen your cervix. You can either take them orally or insert them vaginally.<br>  -You can also try eating some; spicy food, pineapple, Chinese food, red wine, anise, basil or oregano, they are all foods that *might* help kick start labor. None of them are proven, but they can't hurt!<br>  -You can also try some trigger acupressure. Take two fingers and press just below your ankle on the inside. Foot rubs that concentrate on the ankles will work too.<br>  -S-E-X... I know, I know, isn't that how you got yourself into this situation?!? But the prostaglandins in semen will help soften your cervix. And the rocking motion, especially of "doggie" style will help bring the baby down.<br>  -Nipple stimulation. It helps release oxcytocin. It also goes along great with the sex...lol<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is relax and know he won't be in there forever. Eventually he has to come out! At least that's what they've always told me. I know it's not easy. So try not to send too many mean thoughts and dirty looks to the women who just tell you "He'll come when he's ready, don't rush him!" Because it is true. And relaxing and enjoying these last few days, hours, minutes... will help him come sooner!<br>  <br>  AND...<br>  -As far as taking black/blue cohosh; they should only EVER be taken under the supervision of a midwife or OB. It can bring on labor quickly and give you very intense contractions that start out very close together. I'm not saying they don't work, they do, just sometimes they work TOO well.<br>  -Castor oil I would only suggest taking with the okay of your midwife or OB. I have taken castor oil with both of my children. But that was only after having my membranes stripped and knowing I was in early labor. It just kind of helps things get moving along, if you know what I mean... It's not dangerous as long you stay well hydrated. I suggest taking two tablespoons with orange juice every three hours, up to 6 tablespoons total. I like to follow it with a peanut butter cup chaser to help kill the taste. Other suggestions are root beer floats or cooking it into scrambled eggs.|`|ITu6gONdaa	Personally, i was due yesterday and i have tried everything in the book. I also know that she will come when she is ready but i was anxious too. I tried:<br>  <br>  Lots of sex<br>  Walking forever<br>  Bouncing on a ball<br>  Taking Evening Primrose Oil<br>  Changes in elevation<br>  Eating spicy foods<br>  <br>  Nothing worked for me but you can give it a shot. It might work for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|lvLBBAqkaa	I hope you get more answers because I am in the same boat. I am 38wks2days today and I have tried everything under the sun to induce myself and absolutely nothing has worked, the best i've had is 2 contractions (I think)<br>  I have an appt today with my doc to see if he can do something (possibly a membrane sweep) and I'm hoping to have a little more success with that.<br>  I have tried:<br>  <br>  Raspberry leaf tea<br>  castor oil<br>  Nipple stimulation (With a breast pump)<br>  sex, sex and more sex<br>  walking for miles a day<br>  curry<br>  bouncing<br>  strenuous activity<br>  pineapple...<br>  Pretty much everything ever recommended<br>  <br>  You could try these things also and see if you have more luck. I would recommend the raspberry leaf tea though because it also prepares your cervix for labour and delivery.<br>  Good luck x|`|de2a2663fe4b3d02deeeda407aee1db1aa	My doctor did this hurt like hell. It didn't work. I took 2 teaspoons of castor oil mixed in orange juice and THAT DID WORK for me. Kicked me into labor about 6 hrs. after taking it and my labor/delivery was 30 minutes long. Fastest most painful thing Ive ever went through. Wouldn't trade it for a pitocin induced 16 hour labor for nothing in the world.LOL

vGxipYJnaa	Some people like input from strangers. Sometimes the insight from someone else can be useful. When we were deciding on names for our daughter I asked a question here about what possible nicknames could arise from any of the names on our list. I got a lot of great answers about nicknames I never would have thought about. We wanted to pick a name that had nicknames that we also liked - and Yahoo Answers did help!|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	You know you could just NOT answer the baby names questions. I am expecting a child and have asked several questions looking for feedback from users on the names my hubby and I are considering. We do not like to share the names with the people we know as we had a bad experience with that with our first child. So instead we "try out" the names on here for a general idea of how it will be perceived. To us it may sound great but others make valid points as to why it is not good or why is is a good choice. So get over it and ignore those questions!|`|GgVufxlHaa	The whole point of having a baby names section is so people can offer input when others are having trouble picking out a name for their child. It can sometimes be overwhelming (they're going to have to live with it the rest of their lives) and sometimes a fresh perspective from an outside source is exactly what is needed. They also have probably been looking at baby name dictionaries for ever (I know I did) and just need help making a final decision. It's kind of a big deal, and often parents want as much input as possible- if they didn't, they wouldn't be on Y!A. <br>  If you don't want to help pick out a name- then DON'T. Just stay out of the baby names section-you won't have to look at people's questions asking for help picking their child's name, and we won't have to hear about why you don't want to help. Problem solved.|`|H6ga6hrlaa	Some people wouldnt think of some names with out the help from others and sometimes its those random names that actually get used for their child.  Every person has a different way to name their child.  You don't have to answer the questions for those seeking help with naming their children this is a site where you are free to ask a question there is absolutely no need to be this rude about it frankly i think your question was more stupid then theirs and a complete waste of time.|`|TrBoPj92aa	some people just like general advice as to how popular there names are or if that name is too popular, sometimes its nice to see how the general public will react to an unusual name, whether the child will be bullied<br>  <br>  its not a big deal its what the baby names sections is there for on y/a i understand what your saying but if you don't want to do this for people then don't go there, look on the brights side you get 2points !|`|RhHv5pYwaa	Thank you for the points|`|ERFgFIziaa	why you ask/uhhh.. dunno<br>  Thats what we did, bought a couple books from book store and also used middle names after relatives that we really liked alot. I liked to know the meaning and origin of the name also before I picked it.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You know you can nurse part time?<br>  <br>  Also once your baby is 6 month old you can very easily only nurse when  you are together as long as you nurse on demand at night -no need for formula.<br>  <br>  Guilt is caused by you acting contrary to your own moral code, no one can change your moral code.  Of course your moral code may change over time, but its unlikely you could change it in the next few weeks.  So you will feel guilty.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/newman/17feed_baby_working_moms.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/newman/17feed_ba...</a><br>  3. Babies need to drink milk when the mother is not at home.<br>  <br>  Not true. Three or four good nursings during a 24 hour period plus a variety of solid foods gives the baby all he needs nutritionally, and thus he does not need any other type of milk when you are at your outside job. Of course, solid foods can be mixed with expressed milk or other milk, but this is not necessary.<br>  <br>  4. If the baby is to get milk other than breastmilk, it needs to be artificial baby milk (infant formula) until the baby is at least 9 months of age.<br>  <br>  Not true. If the baby is breastfeeding a few times a day and getting fair quantities of a variety of solid foods, infant formula is neither necessary nor desirable. Indeed, babies who have not had infant formula before 5 or 6 months of age often refuse to drink it because it tastes pretty bad. (If you want to convince yourself of how little we know about breastmilk, ask yourself why it is that, although breastmilk and infant formulas have the same amount of sugar, breastmilk is so much sweeter). If you want to give the baby some other sort of milk, homogenized milk is acceptable at 6 months of age, as long as it is not the baby’s only food. In fact, if the baby is taking good quantities of a wide variety of foods, breastfeeding 3 or 4 times a day, and growing well, homogenized milk or 2% milk is good enough, but also not necessary.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.workandpump.com/reversecycling.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.workandpump.com/reversecyclin...</a><br>   Reverse Cycling basically means that your baby has nights and days mixed up, and eats more at night and sleeps more during the day. This sounds like a nightmare, doesn't it? A baby up all night? You've got a job to go to, how are you supposed to sleep?<br>  <br>  Well, it's not really all that bad. In fact, some moms actively encourage their babies to reverse cycle. Why?? Well, the more your baby eats when you're together, the less he'll need when you're apart. Bottom line - less bottles, less pumping. For moms who work in places where it's really hard to pump, this can be a godsend.<br>  <br>  The keys to making reverse cycling work for you are 1) Making sure your baby gets enough to eat, and 2) Getting enough sleep. Both of these can be solved with the same strategy: Having your baby sleep close to you.<br>  <br>  If your baby is close to you at night, a few neat things happen.<br>  <br>  Your baby eats more: If your baby is close to you at night, you'll probably find he eats more during the night. The reason for this is that when your baby wakes up, you're more likely to wake up with him and feed him. He also may wake up more often with you close by. Babies who sleep alone sleep more deeply (a risk factor for SIDS) and tend to eat less at night (needing more bottles during the day).<br>  <br>  You get better rest: Wait a minute, I just said your baby would wake up more, that you would wake up more - how does this make for better rest?<br>  <br>  The secret is that you and your baby get into similar sleep cycles. When your baby is in a separate room, he wakes up on his sleep cycles, you're on yours, and there's no coordination - so he might be waking up when you're in your deepest sleep (when it's a lot harder to wake up and harder to fall back asleep).<br>  <br>  Also, if your baby is in another room, he has to wake up all the way and start crying before you hear him. You have to wake all the way up and get out of bed, and most likely you sit up in a chair to feed - awake the whole time. Then what? It's 2am, and you're both awake, taking longer for both of you to settle back to sleep. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/weaning-partial.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/weaning/weani...</a><br>  Is part-time nursing beneficial for baby?<br>  <br>  Absolutely! As long as baby is getting mom's milk, he will continue to receive many benefits from breastmilk and the act of breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  Benefits of partial breastfeeding include:<br>  <br>      * Comfort, bonding, skin-to-skin benefits<br>        Mom can provide 100% of these even if very little breastmilk is being obtained during nursing.<br>      * Oral development<br>        The type of sucking required for breastfeeding improves your baby's oral development (even if he gets little milk).<br>      * Disease, allergy-prevention, immunological benefits<br>        Research has shown that the benefits of breastfeeding are generally dose-related: the more breastmilk, the greater the benefit. But even 50 ml of breastmilk per day (or less - there is little research on this) will help to keep your baby healthier than if he received none at all. In fact, the immunities in mom's milk have been shown to increase in concentration as the quantity of milk decreases.<br>      * Nutritional benefits<br>        There are components of mother's milk which cannot be duplicated - even a small quantity of these can be invaluable to your baby.<br>  <br>   <br>  Will my milk dry up if I only nurse once or twice per day?<br>  <br>  Most moms find that they can wean down to a few feedings a day (or even just one) and maintain their supplies at this level for extended periods of time. In established lactation, milk production depends primarily upon milk removal - if milk is removed from the breast, then the breast will continue to make milk.<br>  <br>  Breast refusal due to flow preference is probably a greater danger to the breastfeeding relationship than too-low milk supply. Frequent use of bottles increases the possibility that baby will become frustrated with the slower flow of milk at the breast, and this may lead to breast refusal and an earlier weaning than anticipated. See What can I do when baby wants a faster milk flow? for some tips on dealing with flow preference.|`|RgEtKVaKaa	It is very sad.  I never had to stop breast feeding under your circumstances but when I did stop, I did mourn the loss.  It takes time.  I still feel sad - simply because I am finished having babies & it is an experience that cannot be replicated.  You know, if you think about it, it is good to feel sad about this - if we didn't care, what kind of mommy's would we be.  Good luck to you.  I hope your schedule lightens soon.|`|8NcuUEKkaa	you will feel guilty it wont be the last time either, i breast fed my son for quite a while and expressed for my daughter until she was 5 mnths, your health visitor can advice you of groups in your area or other mums where you can meet up for a coffee and support each other, im suprised you went back to work so early after having a child as well as going to school its bound to be wearing on you, could you not cut your hours down maybe you will feel better , i dont know what your situation is, and i dont know if your in the uk but if you are you will be supported until your child is 5 yrs old, but you can get state maternity for upto 2 yrs after a birth of a child, mums in the uk are not expected to leave their babies atall in the first 2 yrs and will support a decision to be a full time mum until the child is in full time school which is 5 yrs old (i know some start at three but its not compulsory to go full time until 5), you may find having more time just you and the baby weaning her/him on to the bottle will make you feel less guilty as you can see for yourself that it really isnt a bad idea and the choice you have made suits baby as much as you, your a very very busy mum, and its not suprising that its taking its toll you need a break before you break|`|zSEJC6vZaa	Wow!  I'm so impressed by your dedication.  Many other people in your position would have given up on breastfeeding months ago.<br>  <br>  You are a good mommy and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  <br>  <br>  My pediatrician told me that while they recommend breastfeeding until 12 months, the best benefit of breastmilk is during the first six months.  <br>  <br>  If you are having a difficult time, maybe start with dropping the pumping during the day (let him have formula) and breastfeed him when he wakes and at bedtime; this way, you'll still be giving him the benefits of breastfeeding without killing yourself over the pumping.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|QQby0Adoaa	There is nothing to feel guilty about, you have done something a lot of mothers don't.  <br>  <br>  You will want him on a bottle by the time those teeth start coming in.  <br>  <br>  I'm proud of you but if you feel this way your son feels something to, he knows.  <br>  <br>  Keep up the good work, not only are you a mom but your a young woman also, you need to take care of yourself in order to take care of him.<br>  <br>  Good Job!!|`|WlU3NFu6aa	I totally understand. I started drying out and I tried everything to bring the supply up and nothing was working. I was working FT too and was going to start a new job soon. So yeah it was time. I was sooooo not ready. I cried and cried. I was scared I would lose taht closeness. My husband told me that as long as I spent time with our daughter and cuddled her all the time, we would not lose the closeness and he was right. oh, and I weaned at 6.5 months too|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I had to stop at 7 months and it was very hard. He's 8 months now and I still feel guilty sometimes, even though I had to stop due to some medical treatments I was getting. <br>  <br>  It's normal to feel guilty. You'll be feeling guilty in one way or another for the rest of your life :) That's what parents do. Just accept that this is only one of those times that you'll feel bad, you will eventually adjust and in a few months you'll find yourself feeling guilty about something entirely different. That's just what we do.
nKXTjqQWaa	It's so easy to have protected sex I don't understand why people are so "casual" about having unprotected sex with the risk of pregnancy and stds. Sounds like you are both younge.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	take a test if its positive tell him...|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	You said "might" be pregnant.<br>  <br>  i suggest you find out first.<br>  if you are not, please find yourself a real man!|`|a67f223481e1f00da8ea5d7d5f8d576caa	I think you should wait to find out.  If you are then mark your calendar and give him the date you can speak again.  Take it out of his hands completely.  He does not deserve that control over your life.  I certainly would not say anything until I knew for sure and I would greatly consider just cutting him off if you are.  Unless he fought for his rights and acted like a man I would not waste my time.  I am sure there is a reason he is your ex.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	what is it with the immaturity level of people today. This is ridiculous. You guys want to play around and have unprotected sex, then play games with an unborn child's life? Grow up, tell him and then get away from him, take him for child support and be a responsible, mature mother for your child. Dont play anymore games.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Who puts a time limit on not talking if someone's pregnant? If you are and decide to keep it, the baby would still be there after 3 months...?!|`|de2a2663fe4b3d02deeeda407aee1db1aa	Letting him know you MIGHT be pregnant sounds like  a way for you to talk to someone who really doesn't want to talk to you. Him telling you that should be reason enough for you to leave. He's obviously less than a man. However if you ARE pregnant then yes he deserves to know weather hes an asswhole or not. He can make his choice after you tell him, but you will have done your part. Its not worth the drama for a might though. Take a test if its positive tell him. No need in going through all the motions if your not.|`|SSN3qtI2aa	he made you pregnant you can tell him all you want..|`|oKWL6JXYaa	Tell him - you shouldn't have to go through this alone - it's his responsibility too!<br>  <br>  Why is he not talking to you for 3 months?|`|OF1mqEuiaa	DUH!

pQ6ZowQZaa	I had my membranes stripped on Friday afternoon. I was dilated at a 1 when they stripped (or sweeped) them. I had been dilated at a 1 for over a week. Saturday afternoon, I was one of the lucky few who's water broke. I wasn't really feeling any contractions but, my water broke, so that was it! I went to the hospital and was still only dilated at a 2, but since my water had broke, they said they had to deliver within 36 hours. My baby was born 13 hours later. It hurts a little to have them sweeped, a little uncomfortable pressure, but I thought it was worth it!|`|230NbPVUaa	It totally worked for me! I had mine done on a Thursday...and he was born saturday morning!|`|tILtI2Jlaa	I did and went into labor about a week later...on my due date.
2Av3gIqgaa	I was also 14 when I lost mine.  I didn't tell my mom and I really wish that I would have.  She found out later and she was really mad that I didn't tell her.<br>  <br>  When you lose your virginity that early, its really hard to deal with because you don't really understand it.  At 26, I'm still trying to deal with it - although I didn't lose mine under the best of circumstances.<br>  <br>  If you think that your mom and sister will be supportive of you and help you work through all of the emotions that you are feeling, then you should definitely tell them.  And, I don't mean supportive of you having sex, I mean supportive of your feelings and emotions and will to help you with them.  Please realize that you made a mistake and you should not have sex again until you are ready to do so.  Also, tell your mom and sister but try not to let anyone else find out.  The worst part about my situation was that everyone knew.<br>  <br>  You are not a horrible person, you just made a mistake and it sounds like you realize that.  Also, there is no set point where you can no longer say "no" when you are messing around with a boy.  If you are uncomfortable with where your actions are going, you can always say, "stop".  If he has a problem with that, don't feel bad.  It's your body and only you can make the decision on what happens to it.  Please remember how you are feeling right now and do not have sex anymore unless you know that you are in a stable and loving relationship.  Its not worth it.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Edit - Also, it is very important that you go to the doctor or to planned parenthood to make sure that you're not pregnant and to get on birth control.  Again, good luck!|`|UJ4heej6aa	You really need to tell your mom. If you've become sexually active, she can get you on birth control asap so you don't get pregnant.<br>  <br>  It's good to be open with your parents about this stuff. I'm 19, and when I lost my virginity at the age of 17 I told my mom right away. Usually it's better to be honest about it up front rather than have her find out on her own. She will think you are very mature for being honest and open with her. And you will show your level of responsibility by asking about birth control. Prove your maturity to her by being truthful and safe!|`|RhHv5pYwaa	You know my mom was not an easy person to talk to but I told her and to be honest she made me feel like I was some kind of slut and I was 18 years old. But it is important to be honest. It's for your protection.

If that happened to me (30 years ago), I would not tell my mom.  If it happened to my daughter (which I have two of) I would want her to tell me and I would be loving and supportive.  I would want to help her understand it and talk about getting birth control if she thinks it will happen again.  Hopefully, your mom is open minded and not going to judge you.  Best would probably be to talk to your sister first.  Just tell her you need to talk about something very important and very personal.  Tell her you want to tell your mom, and she'll help you figure out the best way to do it.<br>  <br>  I really think you should tell your mom, and no matter how she reacts, try to understand that she loves you and she wants the best for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|9YiteTX0aa	I'm 13.

Qhyovyj8aa	I love how they say they're dating. What do they do? Hug? Hold hands? Get their parents to drive them to the movies? In 6th grade you can't even pay for anything yourself. It's not exactly what I call 'dating', but whatever keeps them happy. I think people just like to say that they have a boyfriend/girlfriend. It doesn't bother me all that much. What does bother me are the ones that say 'Oh my god, I love him so much and we're gonna be together forever' and then break up the next week.|`|RWYMy7jOaa	Yes. <br>  <br>  I am fourteen, and yes, i have had a couple of boyfriends, but i never told them i loved them (im not going to lie) and we did go out.<br>  <br>  what bothers me is the ones that say their gonna be together forever, its like your 13, you will never see them again after school.<br>  <br>  (:|`|uiTMPxaqaa	I think its stupid to say i love you but if you go out i think its okay but 6th grade is pretty young|`|d397dMRZaa	I agree.

Those girls will be like that all through high school. That's the way it was at my school. They still don't know what love is you can tell.

I see tons of babies with flat heads and they almost always even out after the baby starts to crawl and sit up on there own.

Do a bit more tummy time and even hold her sitting up and supported to keep her off of her head a bit more.<br>  <br>  My son was a side sleeper, I couldn't stop him, so I rotated him from side to side each time he slept. He never really cared for his carseat, bouncy seat, or swing so he was held a lot and never got the flat spot but had a funny bald spot on each side from sleeping.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i would suggest a 'noggin nest' by boppy; not for bed, but you can put it in bouncer, swing, etc....i used the luxe black one with my dd like this...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Boppy-Noggin-Support-Black-Minky/dp/B000MYXCI6" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Boppy-Noggin-Suppo...</a><br>  <br>  that is the one i had but if you google it, they make a denim one too; the one i had was great! and it was soft, but it also was shaped and had enough support to keep the pressure off the back of the head....hth<br>  and it isn't a myth, some children get it so severely they have to wear a medical helmet to try to straighten it out....of course that is the extreme case...<br>  <br>  also holding and carrying your baby helps; slings didn't work for me, but i got a baby bjorn with back support and my dd is now nine mos and still will just fall asleep in it if we are out and she's tired..she's always done that so i figure she's pretty comfy; and i have two hands free....<br>  <br>  and give her as much tummy time as she will take....at five mos, she will soon if not already, be trying to crawl or sit up, that will all help; basically anything that gets that head off the pressure...|`|oSMNx6L5aa	It's nothing to worry about, my son had one as well, it's because she 's  not very mobile yet, and the back of her head will rub against a swing,floor,bed, etc, it'll also cause it to flatten wherever her head usually lays It's okay, when she starts moving around more and being more active it'll go right away.

My daughter was a bald little girl around 6-7 months old, but then her hair came back in.  She also had the flat side.  When you lay your daughter down, try to turn her head to the other side.  It will eventually even out as she spends more time rolling over and on her belly.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	LOL back of her head where it touches her bouncy chair?? Never seen a little one without that patch!!!  Will grow back soon, I promise!|`|ikO2If2oaa	This is completely normal!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Why Do Babies Lose Their Hair?<br>  <br>  <br>  I know a baby born with so much thick and preternaturally groomed hair, his family said he looked like one of the Kennedys. Conversely, many a newborn emerges Eisenhower-bald. Either way, most newborns lose whatever hair they were born with in the Trst three or four months of life.<br>  <br>  But wait — there's no need to resort to babytoupee.com (yes, it's a real site). Unlike the normal cycles of adult hair growth, elevated hormone levels during pregnancy prolong the hair growth phase for fetus and mother. Then, after birth, hormone levels drop, causing many of the baby's hair follicles to enter the telogen phase, a resting stage. When the next growth phase begins, the new hair (sometimes a different color or texture) pushes out the old, and before you know it, you're looking at a lot of scalp (at least until the new hair's a bit longer).<br>  <br>  Another type of baby baldness occurs when an infant tends to sleep on the same side of her head, causing bald patches. You can try adjusting her sleeping position and see if she'll tolerate it. If not, there's always the comb-over.|`|x6Koc6wLaa	Keep switching up which way the baby lays down.

WZwPHpTdaa	I don't know who told you that by 4 months your baby should be sleeping through - but they lied!!  Most babies that age need to feed overnight and it is perfectly normal fro them to wake 2-3 times a night!!  Definitely agree that 12-1am is way too late fro bedtime though.   You could try putting him down at a more 'normal' time, between 7-8pm then giving him a dream feed sometime between 10pm and midnight and see if that helps, but I think my gut feeling is that you are being totally unrealistic in your expectations of his sleep.  Oh and co-sleeping is fab - you'll miss it when he doesn't do it any more!  Enjoy thise night time cuddles!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I'm sorry to say that there might not be much you can do other than work on getting to bed at a better time. My son is 12 months old this week and still up more than 3 times most nights and I have tried it all. Babies need a set amount of awake time before bed. Figure out how much time that is for your baby and adjust naps so he/she has that awake time ending at maybe 11pm instead. You can gradually inch it  back until you are happy with the time, don't try to move it by 3hrs all at once, 30-60 minute changes at a time are all you can expect.<br>  <br>  The other thing that helps is routine. Even if sleep doesn't get better it's easier to adjust yourself around it if it's predictable. Go to bed and take naps the same way each day.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i really think your baby would sleep better out of your bed...and some babies do actually sleep through the night bc our dd has always; we used to have to wake her up in the am for  a feed bc she was still sleeping....and she sleeps from about 930p to about 830a....u really can't fight the schedule, but you can tweak it....bassinet or play yard in your room would be great and would keep you from having to break baby later from cosleeping and i think the whole family would sleep better.....slowly work his bedtime back in small increments until he's not going to bed so late....some babies continue to wake up at night for a long time....if u handle it right and keep it boring as helll when baby wakes, that may encourage baby to just sleep..no eye contact, no talking, just patting or shhhhhing, give back the passy, etc...dim, dim light; gl|`|oXIYHsDaaa	I've co slept with both my kids but they still have always had a regular bed time, Start trying to get baby down in his/her own bed at a resonable time, then when they wake up take them to bed with you. Start a bed time rutine, it doesn't have to be anything huge, I've never used a bath as part of the rutine because sometimes you wont be able to get a bath in and babies don;t need a bath every night. At 7:30 I get my daughter into her pajamas, wash her face and swaddle her or zip her into her sleep sac, then I nurse her while singing the same song everynight, if she falls asleep nursing I put her in the crib asleep, if she doen't then when she's done eating I put her in the crib, turn the night light on and then sing my son's bedtime song (they share a room and have the same bedtime) by the time I sing the second song she is usually asleep, if not I give her her soother and turn on the mobile or crib aquarium and leave. We have done the same rutine since she was a month old and so now she starts yawning as soon as I start to sing her song. If she wakes up during the night I just go get her and bring her into bed with us. Starting out the night in the crib gives you some time to yourself in the evening and helps to instill the bedtime rutine without the hassle, fights, and crying that people deal with when trying to make their poor little babies sleep in the crib all night long.|`|UghJ0XROaa	Well then i am with you and we don't have most babies. My daughter is also four months and she does not sleep through the night yet. If your goal is to get him to sleep all night, then try putting him a pack and play next to the bed instead, maybe somehow you are waking him without realizing. It's worth a shot.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.drjen4kids.com/soap%20box/sleep%20stuff.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjen4kids.com/soap%20box/sle...</a><br>  How come my friend's baby sleeps through the night?<br>  <br>  I don't know.  I don't even know what that means. When I ask about what that means, I get a great variety of answers.  Some people think 6 hours of sleep at night is "through the night" other people want to sleep like they did before they had kids.<br>  <br>  I would guess that the kids aren't sleeping through the night, but that the implications of admitting that your kid isn't sleeping are too nasty to admit.  We equate "good sleepers" with good kids, and "bad sleepers" with bad kids.  Really, we make moral implications from normal baby behaviors. And of course, parents of good sleepers are good parents.  And since 80% of us have kids with "sleep problems," 80% of us are bad parents.  Yipes.<br>  <br>  Plus, feeding choice plays a role here.  Formula fed kids sleep differently than breastfed kids.  Formula fed kids sleep for longer stretches of time and therefore have less contact with their parents at night.  Formula fed children are much more likely to be sleeping alone. <br>  <br>  The sleep training techniques that have been sold in the US have never been shown to be associated with anything good for infants but it has been associated with bad stuff, like more anxious children and behavior disturbances. There is no emotional, social or intellectual benefit to the kids, nor has it ever been shown to help us develop into healthy adult sleepers.<br>  <br>  So...we have to decide what we want from our kids sleeping through the night.  I would guess that all the good things that we want for our kids' futures mean that we don't have them sleep through the night.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeeding-basics.com/html/night_waking.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeeding-basics.com/html...</a><br>  The answer is “no”. Once you become a mother, you will never, ever sleep the way you did before you had your baby. Even when he starts sleeping through the night, which will happen eventually (I promise), you will always have your mom radar on and will be listening for a cry in the night. Even if he is a teenager out on a date, you will lie in bed waiting for his car to pull in the driveway before you can fall asleep. When he is middle aged and balding, you will still worry about whether  he is taking care of himself the way he should.  The question “When will my baby start sleeping through the night?’ is one that I dread the most. Like most health professionals, I like questions that have easy answers, and this one doesn’t. I do have opinions about how to handle sleep problems, based on my experience with nursing six children, and over twenty years of working with new mothers. What I don’t have is a quick fix, or a magic solution for you that will make your baby sleep through the night.<br>  <br>  ‘Experts’ can’t even agree on what sleeping through the night means. Some define a five- hour stretch as sleeping all night, others define it as an eight to twelve hour stretch. Sleep problems are a hot topic. There are dozens of books and hundreds of magazine articles on how to get your baby to sleep longer. In our culture, a ‘good’ baby is defined as one who sleeps a lot and demands as little attention as possible. If you define sleep problems the way many experts do, then almost all babies have some sort of sleep problem.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drjen4kids.com/soap%20box/sleep%20stuff.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjen4kids.com/soap%20box/sle...</a><br>  Normal babies sleep during the day and are up at night, at least for the first several (6-8) weeks.  That is normal and expected and nothing we can do to change that.  That means that parents need to sleep when the baby is sleeping to avoid all the great things that go along with sleep deprivation.  Older infants get up at night, but less often, and it is normal for one year olds to not be sleeping through the night.  Of course, if I did my job earlier, you now understand that nobody sleeps through the night.  Interesting tidbit: about 80% of parents of one year olds identify their children as having "sleep problems."  Eighty percent?  Maybe we have an expectation for our children that is not based on human physiology and is therefore not realistic. Maybe they don't really have a sleep problem.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/sleepstudies.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/...</a><br>  Sadler S. Sleep: what is normal at six months?<br>  Prof Care Mother Child 1994 Aug-Sep;4(6):166-7.<br>  <br>  In this study, part of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ALSPAC), researchers surveyed the parents of 640 babies. Some of the results:<br>  <br>      * Only 16% slept through the night at six months old -- 84% were not sleeping through the night at 6 months<br>      * 17% woke more than once per night, ranging from twice to eight times<br>      * 5% woke once every night<br>      * 9% woke most nights<br>      * 50% woke occasionally<br>      * 16% of six-month-olds had no regular sleeping pattern<br>  <br>   <br>  Armstrong KL, Quinn RA & Dadds MR. The sleep patterns of normal children.<br>  Medical Journal of Australia 1994 Aug 1;161(3):202-6.<br>  <br>  The above study is the definitive work on sleeping habits of (Australian) children to 38 months. The researchers surveyed 3269 parents, with a 96.5% response rate, over a one week period. The parents had to report on their child's sleeping habits over the past 24 hours, plus answer a few questions related to their perceptions of their child's sleep behavior.<br>  <br>  What did they find?<br>  <br>      * There is a wide range of normal childhood sleep behavior.<br>      * Circadian rhythm is not well established until four months of age.<br>      * Daytime sleep becomes less regular with increasing age, the most marked reduction in length occurs around 3 months of age. However, a surprising 11% under 3 months of age don't have a daytime sleep every day.<br>      * Frequent night waking that disturbs parents is common from 4-12 months (12.7% disturb their parents 3 or more times every night).<br>      * Night time settling requires more parental input from 18 months.<br>      * Nearly a third of parents have a significant problem with their child's sleep behavior.<br>      * Sleeping through the night: 71.4% did this on at least one occasion by 3 months of age, but many of these relapse into more frequent waking in the 4 to 12 month period. It is not until after 24 months that regular night waking (requiring attention) becomes much less common.<br>  <br>  Although this study did not address breastfeeding, it is relevant because a lack of understanding of "normal" sleep patterns can lead to supplementing, early solids, belief there is not enough milk, etc. The authors claim it also leads to misdiagnosis of gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) and overuse of sedative medication. A worrying 31% of 25-38 month-old children were disciplined (mostly smacking) to get them to settle. 27% of parents let their children cry, 11% at less than one month.<br>  <br>   <br>  Scher A. A longitudinal study of night waking in the first year.<br>  Child Care Health Dev 1991 Sep-Oct;17(5):295-302.<br>  <br>  Abstract: A longitudinal study of the development of sleep patterns addressed the issue of continuity and change in night waking in the course of the first year. Mothers of 118 infants, who took part in a follow-up study of normal babies, completed a sleep questionnaire at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Regular night waking was a common characteristic throughout the first year:<br>  Baby's age<br>   <br>  % babies waking at night<br>  3 months<br>   <br>  46%<br>  6 months<br>   <br>  39%<br>  9 months<br>   <br>  58%<br>  12 months<br>   <br>  55%<br>  <br>  The number of awakenings per night was a function of age. Following a decline in the number of interruptions from 3 to 6 months, an increase in night waking at age 9 months was recorded. Although the methodology does not lend itself to an objective validation of the changes in sleep-wake states, nor is it suitable for causal explanations, it is, nevertheless, important to note this profile. The increase in night waking towards the end of the first year coincides with significant socio-emotional advances which characterize this developmental stage.|`|XkHiFJMKaa	my daughter just started sleeping through the night at 14 months and even then sometimes wakes up. my 3 year ols still wakes up at least 2 times a week.<br>  <br>  get use to it hunny.|`|A1QpwziEaa	My son is 4 1/2 months old.  it may be a coincidence, but when my son was first born, the only way we'd get sleep since I am nursing as well, was to co-sleep.  He would wake up every couple of hours to nurse.  My husband finally convinced me to start using the bassinet in our room around 1 month old and he started to sleep 4 hour stretches.  After some protest from myself, we moved him to his crib with no difficulty at just over 2 months old and he immediately started to sleep 6-8 hour stretches.  within a couple of weeks and ever since, our typical bedtime routine has been 7:30-8:00pm and he sleeps until 5:30-6:30am, quick change and nurse and then back to sleep until 8:30-9:30am.  I've read that co-sleeping provides both mom and baby with lighter sleeping patterns (which has pros and cons)...if you're looking to get more/better sleep, maybe you should try separating.  Try establishing a solid bedtime routine and putting him down earlier.|`|7J3SMZXcaa	if he is co-sleeping, he can smell your milk which might make him wake up to eat more often. have you tried a co-sleeper? The couple time I had to place my little one in the bed with us, she woke up much more than she did in her bassinet to eat. I would wake up to her up against me biting her fists, and I truly believe it was because she could smell my milk.<br>  <br>  Does he get naps through the day? My baby used to go to bed around midnight, but luckily she now going down around 10pm, even though she doesn't fall asleep right away. It seems in the last week, she has been showing tired sign even earlier! At 4 months he should be getting a nap around every 2-3 hours. I'm reading the "healthy sleep habits, happy baby" book, and it seems to make a lot of sense. It's philosophy is an overtired baby won't sleep as well as a well napped baby. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and from what I know my little one sleeping very long stretches at night (going down around 10pm) with only crying a bit around 6am for her pacifer is very rare, and that I'm very lucky. All babies are different, and sleeping through the night in medical terms is 5 hours of uninterupted sleep.|`|YCJz2DiWaa	Why does your baby go to bed so late? <br>  You having to wake up in the middle of the night, kind of comes with having a baby. <br>  My routine with my baby is start the bedtime routine at around 7:30 pm, he is usually asleep by 9:00 pm, and then I feed him right before I go to bed which is usually midnight, and then he wakes up at 5:00 am. You could try it. See how it works.|`|dW4DbkCLaa	First of all, you should put your baby to sleep earlier than 12 or 1 in the morning. And waking up 2-3 times a night is totally normal at 4 months old. You might want to consider putting your little one in a crib or a playpen next to your bed. Sometimes mom moving or snoring can wake the baby up. My girl is in a playpen next to my bed and this works great for us. :)|`|f298053ebd42df4c5da5f85a6ead96d4aa	My 22 month old still wakes 2-3 times per night, co sleeps.<br>  <br>  Totally normal for my nearly 2 year old, and even more normal for your 4 month old. MOST babies do not sleep through at that age, regardless of what your doctor and friends will tell you.|`|txv7TIgiaa	my daughter still wakes up at least 2 times in the night and co sleeps she is 15 months so good luck with that|`|TvYX1yXWaa	my sons 4 months old and he wakes up every 2 hours . he sleeps in his swing cause he needs movement to fall asleep|`|VdnAH78Xaa	i have a 4 month old that co sleeps and she''ll eat at like 4 then she goes to bed usually around 7 or 8. Then she'll wake up around 11pm,3am,&6am. ITS A MESS.|`|2yjpDdPzaa	I have two-month old twins, and my friend who has a three-month old just told me about a book she follows called "the Contented Little Baby".  Apparently the book gives a structured routine schedule to follow, that if you follow will result in sleeping through the night.  She follows it and her baby does sleep through the night at 3 months.  I haven't bought it yet, but apparently you have to be ready to commit to a full schedule of events during the day.  It tells you when to feed, when to let them nap, when to play, etc.  The reviews on the internet seem to be very split - either a firm believer or hater of the practices in the book.  I think it also involves not allowing your baby to "feed on demand", so you have to be prepared to let him/her cry.|`|mEsMBOH9aa	Yeah, unfortunately, this is pretty normal.  Four months is not at all unusual to not be sleeping through the night yet.  At least, with co-sleeping, you're not having to drag yourself out of bed to feed the baby!<br>  <br>  Once my daughter was able to find and latch on to the breast by herself, I'd "play possum" (pretend to be asleep), as she tended to get back to sleep faster if she didn't think playing was an option.<br>  <br>  If you feel the need for more answers, try Dr. Sears' _The_Sleep_Book_.<br>  <br>  This, too, shall pass.  I promise!
c60d629a9c752c61dbe6a0c1f82dda78aa	when my contractions started, i could still feel baby moving around between the contractions but not during. <br>  <br>  If your baby has been moving normally up until contractions start, the baby should continue moving somewhat between the contractions as well. <br>  <br>  If you baby doesn't move around between contractions when it normally would be, it's time to get down to the hospital and get the baby monitored.|`|pQ6ZowQZaa	How far along are you? Sometimes, when you are very far along, the baby's movement slows down anyways. And when your uterus is contracting, the baby has even less room to move around. Do not be alarmes, but if you feel something is wrong...go to the hospital!|`|oWAUb6vpaa	Generally, no. There is some pressure on the baby when you have contractions so most of the time you shouldn't feel it move. However, I know I've felt mine trying to move from time to time and it hurts - lol. <br>  <br>  Congratulations, mom!|`|tILtI2Jlaa	It depends on how big the baby is and how much room is in there.  My daughter was a 10 pounder and I didn't feel her moving much after my contractions started - however she didn't have a lot of room either.|`|LTTips1vaa	i never felt the baby moving while having contractions.  If your worried try laying still for an hour and do a kick count.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	my baby didnt move during contractions, she was too busy being squeezed down the birth canal :)
s1utniuvaa	They have shirts that say stuff like I'll Bite... Warning Pregnant woman I may eat your hand... Spencer's is full of them... I just start reaching for their stomachs and say Ohhh my turn!|`|Hu9yquP4aa	It is not wrong to feel that way. I do. <br>  <br>  One woman came up to me in the grocery store and said, "can I rub your tummy for luck" and I said, "can I rub yours?"<br>  <br>  She looked offended and I said, then dont ask to touch me. <br>  <br>  I don't care what they think, personal space is important. Besides people are insane.|`|01vMpHkWaa	i had this problem<br>  some people who actually polite and would ask me first...<br>  other just acted like i was a magnet and their hands were metal<br>  i would just smile and kind of shy away. they got the hint<br>  <br>  i would also tell them your tickling me and pull away|`|230NbPVUaa	rub them back that's what i did and they haven't done it since|`|7SKVCPcSaa	it happens to all pregnant women and i'm not really sure why.<br>  <br>  and you aren't being rude. i HATE it when people touch my stomach. <br>  <br>  just tell them when they go to touch your stomach that you're not ok with that and you would prefer if they didn't. if they *****, tell them to get knocked up and rub their own stomachs!|`|mVXBOI6Qaa	You will just have to flat out tell them.<br>  You could say something like I know you want to touch my belly, but I'm not very comfortable when people do that to me.<br>  or....<br>  I'm sorry, but mom and baby need their own personal space just like everybody else does.|`|OGV3NtYSaa	Just tell them and I am sure they will understand. There is something about a pregnant belly that people just want to touch it. Just explain nicely to them that is makes you uncomfortable .|`|CKnHMYHnaa	You can't possible be showing yet, so why would they touch you at this time?  You'd better let them know your not comfortable with it now b/c once you start showing... the wandering hands will get worse.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	well what i started doing last time i was pregnant was when they'd touch my stomach i'd reach out and touch theirs. they would usually take that as a sign and stop.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	i think its wierd too.  why would some one want to go up to someone and rub their big old, stretched out pregnant belly?  it grosses me out.  no offense of course.|`|LFXTpqfdaa	Just move away and tell them your belly is sore. Or ask, "Can I touch your uterus now, too?"|`|3aV4lcCqaa	i think its just instinct to touch - i know what your saying though, dunno how to go about getting them to stop. sorry|`|xEunWNGKaa	having been through 2 pregnancies i know how annoying it is that total strangers think its ok to just come up and touch you. If you dont want to tell people to keep their hands off there are lots of cool t.shirts available with logos such as DO NOT TOUCH THE BUMP on them which should work you can get them from most baby shops.|`|T1LdAIabaa	Here's where its nice to be overweight lol.  I'm 30w and just look fatter so strangers aren't really a problem for me.  <br>  <br>  My in-laws on the other hand. . . my husband calls them before social gatherings and reminds them to back off.  He forgot before thanksgiving and I almost kneed my m-i-l in the nose *I wasn't showing at all, she got eye level with my fat and was talking baby to it*|`|uVlr8uKxaa	I'm right there with you.  I think several people here have good advice: have clear body language, joke, subvert (you're tickling me) or snap (what the heck do you think you are doing?!?).  When they ask, which is nicer I guess, politely say, "No. Thanks for asking"<br>  <br>  Regardless, what they think is irrelevant.  If they are a mother, they should understand.  If they don't, who cares?|`|AA11197832	lol...I guess you could be straight up with people and tell them how you feel "your not a touchy type of person" (neither am I) and that you dont want em to touch you.  OR you could just back away and say "no Im way to ticklish" and that should help.  If not start being a real cranky pregnant woman and go off on a MOFO lol.  Sorry, hope this helps 4 ya.|`|j9RFYcKaaa	That has to be one of the most annoying situations in pregnancy (that and unwanted advice). I always just held my own belly around those people and as they got closer, I would slowly inch backward. Some people are dense, but people should pick up on body language clues. If it gets bad, you might have to say something...I was never that brave.|`|5DWJ0jZ9aa	hmm... that's a tough one, especially because it only gets worse the further along you get.  you're not being rude, it bothers me alot too (I'm now 9 months).  I guess you can tell them, but risk them feeling like you are being rude...|`|txv7TIgiaa	tell people it makes you uncomfortable|`|RX4nj825aa	tell tgem to back off|`|oWAUb6vpaa	I completely understand! <br>  <br>  It's not being rude - it's your right to want to keep your body private regardless if you're pregnant or not. <br>  <br>  I cannot tolerate when others attempt to touch my belly either. I made jokes and would day things like, "Can I rub your belly next?" Some people didn't get it at all so I just straight up let them know politely, "I really don't like people touching my belly," etc. etc. I mentioned it out loud like when talking on the phone intentionally for others to hear (but I was polite as I could be.) However, it's still YOUR body and people should respect your decision.**   I don't hink they'd like it if we walked up to them rubbing on their body parts and they shoudln;t do it to you either.* <br>  <br>  Eventually, I simply had to tell people out right just tried to be polite so as to not embarrass anyone, especially those I cared about. I've even had to block my belly with my hands/arms and yes some people were a little offended (like those close to me) but imagine how I felt when they touched me without permission! They're rude - not me.* It's seems to be such a natural reaction for others to do this and that's why I tried to be polite but it's still rude for others to do this to you. <br>  (they should at least ask you first - my goodness!) <br>  <br>  Besides not wanting others to violate my personal space and body, I have religious reasons for not wanting people to touch my belly. <br>  <br>  You have every right to keep your body private and others shouldn't invite themselves to make you feel uncomfortable. You need to let people know asap so that it stops now, because as your belly grows more and more people are going to want to touch your growing baby.<br>  <br>  Congratulations, mom!|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	do what i do, carry around a rubber spatula and swat them . I hate being touched, im one of those really mean and cranky pregnant lady's. Just swat them and look at them, its so funny how they react. I was in walmart the other day and this lady comes up to me and touches my stomach and asks how far along i am (complete stranger), so i was in the bake ware section and i grabbed a spatula and swatted her hand. She just kept her hand on my stomach too, not a quick rub and be done with it, well she walked away pretty fast, and i bought the spatula. I dont mind when my b/f dose it either but thats it.<br>  <br>  lol i got one of those t-shirts from spencers says "touch the tummy and die" or something like that or touch the tummy loose a hand<br>  <br>  or another method to use is when strangers come up to you, just say "im not pregnant"|`|abx5VNsOaa	Like wet paint to some people,they can't resist,you may have to be blunt and blame it on 'pregnancy hormones' when you tell them "back off"!!

THC actually slows down the growth of cancer cells. Both have tar, but cigarette tar is worse for you because of the additives tobacco companied put in tobacco products. nicotine is PURPOSEFULLY added so you come back and buy more. weed isn't addictive itself, but those with addictive personalities can think they are addicted. weed doesn't cause cancer, doesn't make you a drug addict, and doesn't cause your body permanent harm. tobacco causes cancer and is highly addictive. also, weed doesn't contribute to brain damage. weed is the least harmful thing you can do to yourself. alcohol and tobacco are among the worst things you can put in your body, and they are completely legal. read into why weed is illegal, and your mind will be blown|`|9YiteTX0aa	Cigarettes are bad.

kFOxlebDaa	Ohh my gosh yess!!! I have gotten so many BFN before. (not this cycle though) I got pregnant in late April 2008 and lost it in June that was so sad. =(<br>  Anyway I have this feeling that I am pregnant again but Im so scared to test because it isn't time for my period yet see- I had my lmp February 16-19 and on CD11 (Thursday 26) I had EWCM. And today I am on CD 22. I have a 35 day cycle..so my period should be here in a little less the 2 weeks. I think I should be about 11 days post ovulation..  I am just so scared to test.<br>  Idk what to do! I wish I knew or it was easier to get pregnant. This is also my first month back on the TTC wagon. <br>  Good Luck and Baby Dust to us- and every one TTC!|`|WIQhh62Zaa	Well, first off, I know BFP means positive result...but what does that exact abbreviation stand for?<br>  <br>  Now to answer...it wasn't until today that I realized AF is due in the next 3 days.  I have 28-30 day cycles and right now I am on day 27!!!  I don't want to test until I'm late though because I wasted so much money in January on hpts!|`|9ncWshWBaa	im going crazy waiting for my bfp and got so excited today when i got a faint line on a cassette type ept. it turned out to be an evap line. back to the drawing board i guess :(|`|gK5nobhbaa	for the person who asked what BFP actually stands for its Big Fat Positive!  And yes I am right there with you!  This is the 2nd month of really ttc.  LAst month lots of BFN and it killed me.  This time I am waiting it out and waiting until at least a week late before even thinking about doing a HPT.  Lot's of baby dust to you!|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	My aunt got her BFP today she is so happy i wish you all the same in march Best of Luck>>>>>

zSo7fvGKaa	totally agree with you!<br>  i would think being around prgnent teens<br>  would convince u to wait to have sex!<br>  i mena its like a slap in the face with reality<br>  cause until we actually see that<br>  i believe we choose to believe tht were not going to get pregnent<br>  when in reality chances are we will :/|`|rBq189W1aa	What, are they worried that pregnancy is contagious or something?<br>  <br>  I'm inclined to agree with you. I understand the reasoning behind why the parents are acting this way, but I don't think that reasoning is correct.|`|7aCH91ISaa	Almost sounds like they are afraid their kids might *catch* it. My son has friend that are or were pregnant. I don't keep him from hanging out with them. I am confident in my parenting to trust his decisions at this point. (He's 17).|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Perhaps the not talking to them has nothing to do with the pregnancy and more to do with the character of the students. I would never encourage my kids to shun someone on the basis of pregnancy, but I would based on other personal characteristics.

bTlhBX3daa	Your Dr. would be the best person to get this information from, only because every person's body chemistry is different. Your body may use and process certain nutrients faster than someone else.<br>  <br>  But most pregnancy books have a lot of diet information in them.<br>  <br>  Also, it is said to eat whatever you are craving. Your body will crave foods that are rich with nutrients that you are in need of. Obviously, don't go overboard when you are craving something sweet, but it's always good to eat what your body is craving.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Pick up a copy of "What to eat when you're expecting" by Heidi Murkoff|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Have a well rounded diet of fruits, veggies, whole grains, lean protein... pretty much how we should all eat everyday :-)<br>  <br>  And you can sneak in a little junk food here and there!<br>  <br>  Need more suggestions?

I've been using Yahoo! Answers for a while now, and the less people have to click/research, the more likely they are to respond. I'd recommend reducing it to your top 5, then asking for input under beauty.<br>  Keep in mind things like: color (what colors do you like, what looks good with your skin/hair/eyes), shape (what is most flattering for your body type?), details (sequins, lace, glitter, tulle, etc - if you don't love it, take it off!), "wear-ability" (can you see yourself wearing this? can you dance in it for three hours? can you eat dinner in it and still have it look good after the inevitable "food baby"? is it your style?) and then other misc. things (is your mom going to freak if there are thin straps? will your date be getting too much of an eyefull if the neckline is plunging? is your best friend going to end up in the same one?)<br>  Good luck!<br>  Also - not all of us in this section are parents. But good thinking - I appreciate the thought of getting a parent's perspective, but parents have even less time than the rest of the world to scroll through dresses for other people! Maybe get  only the top 3 if you really want parental perspectives. Also, I'd ask your parents to help you, too!|`|nZVmkZSBaa	I'm not looking through all of those.<br>  But I saw the first one.. --- it's really, really, really ugly.<br>  Just thought you'd like to know. :)<br>  <br>  BTW, if you want better answers, try putting it under the right category.

I'm sure they have made mistakes before?<br>  <br>  It's a bit tricky really, because if you were due your second period - that would make you about 8 weeks pregnant. A test would be VERY positive by this time. However - There are some people who just don't get positive urine tests! Strange I know! What you should do is visit your Doctor, they will give you a blood test which will tell you for sure if you are pregnant or not. You can get the result in as little as 20 minutes!<br>  <br>  The fact that your boobs hurt and you have been sleepy leads me to believe you are pregnant - but I don't get why the test was negative - Unless you have recently concieved?<br>  <br>  I think I had an evaporation line today. Gutted really because I am trying for a baby - we will see in a few days eh :) <br>  <br>  All I can say, is if you ARE pregnant, don't worry, it will all be ok, I had my son at 18, Before him I had never thought of babies, I had never thought about a career - all I cared about was getting rat arsed with friends. <br>  <br>  Now I'm a happy mum, fiance, planning another baby AND uni, I'm very excited about my future! Good luck with what ever happens!xx|`|N0sKHmy2aa	I would wait a couple of days and try another test but make sure its your first wee of the day as thats when the hormones are at their strongest.

Marie means Sea of Bitterness and is of French origin. <br>  <br>  See, James meaning goes with Jacob's meaning. And Mikayla and Michaels meaning already went together. Great choices!

SRzswqTeaa	I don't think that the jerking movement would hurt the baby.  The absolutely *worst* case scenario would be if the placenta started to detach a bit - and that takes quite a forceful jar.  IF that were to happen, you would experience bleeding, so unless you've seen blood, or had your stomach start bloating over a few minutes or hours time, everything is fine.  If you are not having contractions, than you are also fine :-)  Baby is perfectly safe in there, as long as you are fine.  No more worrying tonight k?|`|LFXTpqfdaa	I read that you would have to be struck in the belly with the force it takes to damage internal organs to hurt your baby. This is something to worry about if you were in a car accident or fell down a flight of stairs. You are just fine.|`|qfNK5aDEaa	You should be ok. I actually fell when I was about 20 weeks pregnant. I slipped on a dryer sheet and slid and fell on my butt and i was ok..Unless you fall on your actual stomach then there's really nothing to worry about.|`|KMtd5gr0aa	U'll be ok hon!|`|2ObqoJbKaa	I understand that you worry alot, I do too. Its only natural to worry. but I think that the baby is fine. As long as you didn't fall and nothing hit into your stomach then your fine. Its harder to loose a baby than most people think. You would really have to fall hard, or get a massive blow to the stomach for maybe something to happen to the baby. The baby's pretty well protected in its sac. Talk to your doctor if you are really worried. but Im sure that the baby is fine, and also just make sure you don't start cramping and bleeding. Thats a sign that something would be wrong, and if that doesn't happen in the next day then your fine. good luck.
nZVmkZSBaa	Umm... I know it isn't the same, but is she fond of the name Addie? If so, Addison, Adelaide, Audrey, or Adelle are really nice names. Maybe suggest that if she is still open to other suggestions. :]<br>  <br>  For Abby, she could just name her Abigail, and refer to her as Abby. But I'm not so sure she would go for that idea.

Use a condom either way and it is not an issue.|`|lV3Hk7M1aa	Not unless it runs or drips into your vagina.

If he can't accept it than ditch him, it doesn't sound like he cares about you anyway if he's trying to force you.|`|1YCzew5paa	I would wait as long as possiable. your only 13 i know you have heard it before but your still a baby, you have your whole life ahead of you. If he doesn't want to wait untill your both older then you need another boyfriend who will respect you. its not just getting pregnant eaither there are STD's and all sorts of problems that come with sex. my advice WAIT!|`|a2BBnAQ1aa	do what i did, just say no. and if he doesnt stop bringing it up, break up with him. when i told my bf i was gonna break up with him he stoped. i know im to young for that and my brother would end my life if he found out i did that. im 13 to. almost 14 yay!|`|ItA6oEGCaa	If you're not comfortable, then don't do it. I don't care if you're 30, the same rule still applies.

If the name sticks w/ you and you can't see yourself calling him anything else then that's his name. I named my son Vance and no one really liked it, but other names we explored didn't seem  right since we had been calling him Vance early on. And so that's his name and it fits perfectly and it doesn't bother me that someone might not like it.|`|mhQbtz1Yaa	its a cute name yes, but i am sort of biased towards the name because as a young girl there was a very....indescribable boy named joseph and i disliked him. <br>  <br>  but since you don't seem to know this guy, it's very cute!|`|fbaeMyzLaa	I like the name joseph but personilly i would never name my kid joseph because its kind of a used up name.

And some girls were born practically w/o a hymen, so yes, it's possible. And its not a bad thing, it just means that when you have sex for the first time it will be less painful.<br>  <br>   It can also happen from riding a bike or playing sports .|`|HOdblqIkaa	you broke your hymen that can happen when you use a tampon too. you are still a virgin but yes your "cherry" was "popped" he shouldnt feel bad. you might still bleed when you have sex for the 1st time but its a natural thing when your hymen breaks its not a big deal.|`|iisbgn17aa	Yes, he could have. Aww thats so sweet that he feels bad, but I dont think it matters lol, I mean your still a virgin. Its good that your hymen broke b/c when you have sex for the 1st time it wont hurt a lot like it hurts alotta girls, & you will probably have a better experience. No big deal :)<br>  <br>  Love Sienna<3|`|YQrKQ5PAaa	He could have broken your hymen... It can happen doing numerous things. I think... that if I were him, I would feel bad. I think you should just reassure him on how you feel about it.|`|AA11296427	Yes you could have. But that doesn't mean you're not a virgin, honey :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|7810472dea4ef476f08e138148939625aa	ehh i doubt he could have popped your cherry...<br>  if he did he prob feels bad bc once you lose it you can never get that back...and he knows that.<br>  If he did tho i wouldnt worry much about it..<br>  Now days girls can pop the cherry by just riding a Horse so its not a big deal really (:|`|6pEDLnrzaa	broke you hymen. you can do it while dancing and even using a tampon(:|`|NX4rewuWaa	yes, it couldve popped your cherry.<br>  my ex boyfriend did that to me by fingering me to hard. <br>  yup.

oWAUb6vpaa	You can;t run off to NY - you don't have proper documentation and won't be able to get any until you're 18 yrs. old (a legal adult.) <br>  <br>  You're really setting yourself up for a dangerous situation - many things can happen to you that you really don't want and I don;t think your family wants to see something like that happen to you regardless of the childish mistakes you've made. <br>  <br>  Instead of creating more issues for yourself and your family, why don;t you simply try from this point to make better decisions and straighten out your life?! You really need to stop focusing on these silly things that will soon be a distant part of your past and begin making your future better for yourself. Running away does not solve anything and only creates more stress and pain for you and your family. That kind of thinking really is not rational or reasonable. Make better choices and start from there. One day, you'll be greatful you did and you watch your future blossom and your past mistakes forgotten. : ) <br>  <br>  Good luck, luv..

530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	I think the more you force her or make a fuss about wat she eats the more she will resist. Put the food the family is eating on her pate, if she eats it then fine if she doesn't then don't say anything. Tell he that's whats for dinner. She may be hungry for a day or 2 but she will come around.<br>  Of course, there will always be some foods she really dislikes as it is with all of us, but you must nt let her dictate to you. Good luck.|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	It's a phase. I talked to my doctor about this recently as my daughter (will be 3 tomorrow) has really limited what she will eat. Luckily hers is bread, bananas, yogurt and potatoes-some healthy things. The doctor said as long as she eats to let her eat whatever she wants and she will eventually get over it, she said that's about all we could do, provide the things she likes and make sure she is getting enough to eat and drink.|`|02829b554b7d7f715d842b3f43335790aa	That sounds exactly like my son!  He turned 3 in Nov. It's frustrating, I agree, but I talked to my son's dr. and this is what he mentioned:  As long as they are getting some calories and are drinking and peeing, there really isn't anything to be concerned about just yet.  It's the age.  I give my son Pediasure shakes every once in awhile and he likes those.  We also give him a half of a Flintstones vitamin every morning.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	You have two options:<br>  <br>  1.  Give her what she wants and hope it is just a phase that will pass.<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  2.  Fix a meal for the family (even if it's just the two of you) and tell her this is the meal you are having, and all she is getting till the next meal.  She will eventually eat what you give her.|`|KQL3tqS7aa	You're lucky....my son at 3 only ate chips and yogurt!  I think it's normal for kids to go through a time like that.  Granted, he is still picky about his food compared to when he was 2 and ate whatever I made for him.  Give her some time, she'll come around.  Maybe try seeing if she'll drink a smoothie or something that you can sneak in some fruit.  Make sure she's getting a multivitamin to assure that she's at least getting those vitamins and minerals.  Good luck....I know exactly what you're going through!|`|PnbmpMt5aa	Make her healthy meals and if she doesn't eat it, she will be hungry but she will learn. I agree with the first comment!|`|rlUUaSgqaa	Make sure you model good eating behavior in front of her so she sees you eating healthy food.  Explain to her that eating fruits and vegetables gives you more energy to play and will keep her from getting sick.  If their are healthy foods, she used to like, you can make her taste a bite, but don't force her to eat any more if she doesn't want to.  That will just heighten her association that eating those foods is not fun.
WxQFe0GYaa	Is she hungry?  Is she lonely and/or scared? Is she sick/teething/wet?  Do you go to her when she wakes up or do you let her stay there by herself crying for an hour and a half?|`|n6XYYyoLaa	have u checked to see if she's teething, sick, temp, etc....room temp comfortable with how she's dressed, etc.....are you letting her CIO, or is she crying that long while you hold her? how long has she been asleep before she wakes? six hours at that age is great....if you can't figure it out, i would have her checked out just to be sure; and doc can tell you if she's teething if u aren't sure and can tell you what and how much meds you can give her when she's uncomfortable....|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	Wookie is an excellent example as to why a teenager will never be qualified or good enough to baby-sit for any of my children. (With a few exceptions-- I have a teenage child whom I feel is qualified to baby -sit for his or her younger sibling or I have a teenage niece or nephew whom I feel qualified to baby-sit my baby.) Gee, Wookie, it must be awful for you to actually have to care for the children with whom the parents entrusted you. <br>  <br>  Of course a young baby wants to be constantly held. The world is big, new and scary. They want the comfort, touch and warmth of Mommy and Daddy. My daughter went through a crying stage for the first month of her life. She cried less when I held her. I also let her breast feed as often as she wanted. (She's 17 months. I still do that.) <br>  <br>  When my daughter woke and wakes during the night, my husband will change her diaper (if needed) while I go to the bathroom. When I return, I take her and she nurses until she goes back to sleep. She still does that on the rare occasions she wakes up at night. She had trouble last night. I guess she was having separation anxiety with my being gone Friday evening through early Sunday afternoon. She got mad when I tried to nurse her and my husband left the room, fussed when my in-laws (who were there for the weekend) were leaving, and didn't settle down easily before bed (she cried for an hour), even with my husband and me in the room with her. She also woke up last night. So, we held her and comforted her. Today, she was fine, though she seemed to fight her nap a bit. (She's napping now.) <br>  <br>  For some babies, sleeping through the night comes and goes. Even before my daughter was born, I didn't always "sleep through the night".|`|0nNzDkcDaa	this is the nightmare of the babies, they just Never stop crying<br>  LOL,, U need to stop holding her in ur arms to much, b.c they'll get use to it, and they'll cry every hour b/c they wanna be held.<br>  auhh, i babysitt babies b4 who just cried nonstop, everytime they need to be held.. it's makes me soo mad. lol|`|EMKdWc4Oaa	Its called being an infant. <br>  infants cry<br>  they're babies.<br>  <br>  ....

2arZOZWgaa	Don't worry about it unless he is not gaining weight, or unless he is not having 6-8 wet diapers a day.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	As long as he is healthy, gaining weight, hydrated, and happy he's fine.  Does he ever nurse directly -he could be getting more than you think the times he does nurse.<br>  <br>  As a "rule" breastfed babies take 19-30oz per day after the first month.   There's no rule on how they should get to that amount though, breastfed babies that are partially bottle fed rarely take more than 3oz at a time though.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/milkcalc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/milkc...</a><br>  The research tells us that exclusively breastfed babies take in an average of 25 oz (750 mL) per day between the ages of 1 month and 6 months. Different babies take in different amounts of milk; a typical range of milk intakes is 19-30 oz per day (570-900 mL per day).<br>  <br>  We can use this information to estimate the average amount of milk baby will need at a feeding:<br>  <br>      * Estimate the number of times that baby nurses per day (24 hours).<br>      * Then divide 25 oz by the number of nursings.<br>      * This gives you a "ballpark" figure for the amount of expressed milk your exclusively breastfed baby will need at one feeding.<br>  <br>  Example: If baby usually nurses around 8 times per day, you can guess that baby might need around 3 ounces per feeding when mom is away. (25/8=3.1).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/10/T110225.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/10/T11022...</a><br>  Try what we call the fist test: Tiny babies have tiny tummies, about the size of their fists. Place a full bottle next to baby's fist, notice the size mismatch, and you'll see why the overloaded tummy rebels. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/0/T000100.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/0/T000100...</a><br>  Small, more frequent feedings will work better than larger ones spaced farther apart. Your baby's tummy is about the size of his fist. Take a full bottle and place it next to your baby's fist and you'll see why tiny tummies often spit the milk back up when they're given too much at one time.|`|8NcuUEKkaa	i wouldnt worry unless he loses excessive weight if he does then you will need to build him up your doctor will advise you on this its not advisable to put rusks or cereal in his bottle as his digestive system is not ready for that yet, it can cause problems however think of this, your son is breast fed via bottle you know how much he gets , if he was taking it straight from the breast you wouldnt know how much he had he takes what he needs and saves the rest for later thats what he is doing, keep an eye on his weight if thats fine dont worry|`|7SKVCPcSaa	there is no definite that your son should be eating. only a kind suggestion to go by.<br>  <br>  if your son is eating that much at that interval and is happy and gaining weight, then thats fine.<br>  <br>  but if he is acting hungry and isn't gaining weight, then your breast milk may not be any good. so you may need to go to the doctor and have it tested.|`|dW4DbkCLaa	Do not by any means put cereal in a bottle like the first commenter said! It's a choking hazard.<br>  <br>  Anyway, as long as your baby seems full, I would not worry. Babies eat until they are full and then stop. They cannot overeat but also you can't force them to eat when they are full. I think as long as he is growing properly, you shouldn't worry.
Fd4lITkvaa	Removing the patch brought on a period. You should expect your next period around the 15th although if you suspect you ovulated the 7th I would expect your period closer to the 21st(14 days after ovulation).|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	You should expect your period on 15th or close to it (depends on the length of your cycle).

I would wait until your period is late to test.|`|AA12374498	5 days before your period starts but to be absolutely sure, take it after you missed your period.|`|hORVMOHKaa	after you miss a period so however long that is|`|85V6cHe4aa	Wait at least 14 days,some women can get a result after 10 but 14 is really more accurate as it can take that long for a fertilized egg to implant and release the HCG needed to make a test positive if you are pregnant.

CpiLHcTlaa	okay apparently people don't get that by saying shes a baby killer isn't helping at ALL! these people tick me off... but ANYWAY i've never had one but i've been told you do get some cramping. it varies from person to person how long and how bad they are. and of course shes scared... shes going to have an abortion its scary.. your doing the right thing by comforting her. as long as she thought long and hard and decided this was the rigth thing then that is that.. people who insult her are just stupid and closed minded.  its okay that they don't believe it but you don't need to insult a scared little girl. not called for.. and not nice.<br>  <br>  yup bring on the thumbs down for stating my opinion and answering the question!!!|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	She should be absolutely down right terrified. She's taking another human being's life, she is taking her own baby's life. Everything will not be alright after, that is complete bullsh*t for you to even say that! You can not possibly comfort someone to the point of them being okay. after they have let someone rip apart their baby and sucked out like a piece of garbage. And I can't even believe that you would want to comfort someone who is okay with killing their unborn child. Shame on you! No, really, really shame on you. <br>  She shouldn't be worried about it hurting her, she should be worried about it hurting her baby. Would it hurt you if someone was to rip apart your body, piece by piece? Would you be terrified if you knew that someone was going to do that to you and you had no choice? Her baby is going to suffer more pain then you or I will have to endure in our life times. That baby is going to be put to death all because your friend could not keep her legs closed. Your friend will be in a lot of pain, but that is only a fraction of what her baby had to go through.<br>  Instead of her getting a surgical one done, why don't you: hit her in the stomach with a hammer, mix her a drink of turpentine and bleach, use a coat hanger, or push her off a building. <br>  <br>  You can not come onto this forum asking these kinds of questions. There are many women whom are pregnant and want their babies or women that are trying to conceive, and all your friend wants to do is kill hers. <br>  <br>  Do not support abortion. It is a terrible and horrible procedure done to unborn babies. It is legalized murder. And do you want to have any part in that?|`|yKS2UI87aa	You should try and tell her not to get one. They hurt forever as most women who get them immediately regret it, you can also have the possibility of never having children and you could hemorrhage and die. Tell her to watch "The silent scream" on youtube. There are plenty of good people waiting to adopt. Abortion is killing.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	tell her to google it and watch the videos. Her being sore is the least of her issues.|`|zSEJC6vZaa	I feel for your friend.  She's in a really tough situation with no easy answers.  Kudos to you for wanting to be supportive.<br>  <br>  First, tell your friend to take a deep breath and slooow down.  Don't rush into anything.  Maybe you both can learn from my experience:<br>  <br>  10 years ago, when I was a college freshman, one of my good friends got pregnant.  She freaked out and decided to get an abortion b/c she was sure her parents would kill her.  She asked me to pick her up from the clinic after the procedure.<br>  <br>  Against my better judgement, I agreed, even though I had significant reservations about the abortion. <br>  <br>  We didn't talk about it afterwards and to this day I regret not being a better friend and we are not as close as we used to be.  It's the elephant in the room that we can't talk about.  She felt trapped and I should have been more proactive in helping her find other options besides abortion.  <br>  <br>  As a side note, as a teacher, I have had several pregnant students.  You can still go to school and work when you're pregnant.  I'd try to get her to slow down and not make any hasty decisions - look into giving the baby up for adoption.  There are a lot of places that do pregnancy counseling. <br>  <br>  A lot of people who are desperate to have a baby but can't would give your friend's baby a loving home.|`|A0tWlG94aa	explain to her that she shouldnt abort... its wrong in many religions and plain and simple murder... i would never abort and the idea of abortion makes me sick to my stomach... it must hurt emotionally and physically... and you're proabably sore for about a week|`|z2KBZbK0aa	ive never had one, never will<br>  but yes it does hurt,and she should be scared.<br>  she's commiting murder, plain and simple.<br>  but it's her decision,  <br>  <br>  she'll be sore about a week|`|hORVMOHKaa	i wouldnt know im not a baby killer|`|wENdWT5kaa	Phone the clinic and ask them.<br>  <br>  Your asking in the Pregnancy section where pregnant women want their babies. <br>  <br>  She is terminating a life, the last thing on her mind should be the way she is going to feel.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Every woman is different.  She should worry more about the emotional effects.  The fact that she's scared and needs someone to comfort her says she shouldn't be doing this.
kprKXEOSaa	I don't know how any woman can afford to work and pay for day care.  You have to make an awful lot of money just to cover that cost.  My husband and I have had this conversation a few times--there is no way I could justify working, because of the cost of day care, I just wouldn't be able to make enough money above and beyond that cost, to justify leaving my kids in day care all day long. <br>  <br>  Some families work out their schedules, where the husband works days and the wife works afternoons/evenings, for example, or where one works weekends and the other works during the week.  So either the mom or dad is taking care of the kids, rather than using day care.  I think I would do something like that, if my husband and I really determined that we couldn't make it on his wages alone.  <br>  <br>  I think first-time moms also underestimate how difficult it is to leave a new born.  When I had my first child, I had a little 5-hour a week job, and I would leave my baby with my mom or my husband.  Before giving birth, I thought it would be no big deal--it was only 5 hours, right?  But it was awful.  I felt guilty leaving my little baby with anyone.  I quit when he was just a few weeks old, because I just couldn't bear to leave him.<br>  <br>  Now I run a little from-home business that allows me to make a little more money, and that works out much better for us.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	what did you get pregnant for if  you don't even know if you can afford it?  DUH!|`|2ZoUduoPaa	I understand what you mean.  We actually were blessed enough to be able to put some money into savings, but since the baby was born 3 months ago, that account has slowly been dwendling down.<br>  Why not just check out your local WIC office?  I see no shame in someone who contributes to society to seek help if it's available.  I wanted to, especially for the help with formula as I was unable to breastfeed, but our state says we make too much.  HA!!!  I want to see them make it off our salaries!!!<br>  <br>  Anyway, if this is your first baby, you may have a baby shower.  Make sure you ask for diapers (in all sizes) and wipes.  This helps keep a stock.  My baby is 3 month old and I just had to start buying diapers last week for the first time.  Try looking into a home daycare.  Sometimes they are cheaper and they're a smaller, ensuring your child gets more one on one time.  My LO starts  home Daycare April 6 and it's $15 a week cheaper than the Centers.  <br>  I wish you the best of luck.  Remember, if ANYONE waited until they could AFFORD a baby, we wouldn't have many (if any) running around!!!<br>  You'll make it.  Even if it means sacrifices on your end, because that baby will be all you'll NEED!!!|`|K3FuGAdOaa	between my mom, my mother in law, and my sister in law they watch our 4 month old. we pay our sister in law what we can and she is ok with it and its a great help. i refused to put my daughter in day care and seeing everything they come home with and how do you know they are well taken care of, the thought scares me and i am seriously lucky. family is the greatest way to go if possible....the financial thing will come as you go. my husband and i both work full time and we still dont have much but we have a roof over her head clothes on her back formula in her tummy and provide health insurance. we are happy and we take it day by day|`|I07nxTAxaa	i had to get subsidized daycare where the state pays a portion of it. We make about 1950 a month 4 people in our family and day care would be 250 a month. But the first kid was a daycare baby. i have a 6 month old now and i'm trying to stay home as much as i can. No we cant eat out like we use to, we traded in the mexican restraunt for 89 cent burritos at taco bell. Buy the diapers at wally-world and the cloths on clearance. We usually just make dinner at home. Some how things just work out. the bills eventually always get paid sometimes late. The powers on the stoves a cookin, and the babys got clean diapers.<br>  Dont worry they dont start to get expensive untill they get older.<br>  <br>  GOODLUCK!!|`|uqRChb1Jaa	in our case, i stayed home, its a struggle :) but its worth it, and as it is i would be giving my paycheck to a sitter anyway.   you just have to figure out if its even worth it in that sense if you have to pay a sitter.  <br>  <br>  we have our new 2nd baby now, and i still stay home.. you just magically find the money for the babys.. one big part for me, is definately putting their needs way ahead of my own.  i cant tell you the last time i bought shoes for myself... my husband has to force me to lol <br>  <br>  good luck and dont stress, it will work out|`|72SrLDQ3aa	Is it possible for a family member to watch the baby while you are at work? Family members will usually charge a lot less than a daycare, or won't charge at all.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	idk, we are ok with me staying home; but it will work out....it will have too, it might be hard at first, but you put baby's needs first, then you and hubs....cut coupons, etc...
obN6p3Cgaa	Could be implantation  bleed wish you Luck******|`|paHjJrrdaa	Yes this happened to me last month. It was so wierd. I bled brownish colored blood (really light) for 3 days, then it stoped completley! I took a test and I'm not pregnant! :( Hope that you are!!!! Baby dust *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~|`|5o9yl4fSaa	Ok my LMP was 1/19/2009. My periods are irregular,<br>  between 33-39. Based on my "average" my period was due<br>  between 2/20-2/22. Me and my DH BD 1/26; 2/3-4; 2/13; 2/23-2/24; 2/28. I wasn't paying attention to CM, temps etc for fear of another<br>  let do. So when the 20th came and nothing, 22nd and nothing I wasn't<br>  to concerned since I'm irregular. So on the 28th I had some cramping<br>  and spotting, then i passed a small clot, (tmi) so I said ok my period. Long story short by Sat there was no blood and I had milky white cm. I tested on that day BFN (2/28) BFN again (3/3). So then I started to worry! So by the 5th nothing. I decided to re-test, afterall it was the DH <br>  BDaY.. BFP!! 5 days after the spotting. I re-tested again the next day BFP again.|`|rmse6Mj8aa	i just went through the same thing but i am not pregnant.<br>  i wouldnt read too much into it sometimes we have 'off' cycles.<br>  <br>  if you're concerned you could test, but a 'flow' of red blood is a true period even if it is short and you are unlikely to be pg.<br>  <br>  dont use clearblue +/- blue dye tests whatever you do. i think dollar tree or frer are best.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|3pIBqvWMaa	well the period before i found out i was pregnant was much the same!! mine lasted 3 days and was brownish!! then when i was due on the following month i didnt have my period and was pregnant..so maybe|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Yes it happen to some ladies so may be you are wait and get tested in a few days best of Luck>>>>>>|`|0tQGhulwaa	yes you are ...........<br>  see www.sintims for pregnense.com<br>  .........................................<br>  you too old for sex
mKpVH8j6aa	Hiyah,<br>  Ouch, Thats really mean of your mum and dad to do that to you.<br>  Really, your not the bad son, there the bad parents. <br>  Maybe you should talk to your mum and tell her how angry you are with her, she might not relise whats going on here. Exspaline how you feel and let her tell you how she feels about it all. <br>  If you and your mum sort it out (And i hope you do!) Try sitting down with your dad. <br>  With your Girlfriend Situation, If you really love her, then dont cheat! Look what a mess it made with your family, and if my Boyfriend cheated on me i wouldnt acuatly know what to do with my self.<br>  Focus on Sorting it out with your Parents and brother, and then sort it out with your girlfriend, you might find your able to say "I love you" to her again.<br>  I Hope i helped.<br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  x|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Dude you should model if you are that tall.
cfdooGylaa	Don't think anyone here can accurately tell you what kind of cramps they are. Since your period is running late you can take a test.|`|Bs8sllD9aa	I would test and if it comes out neg and you still don't get your period in about 7 days after testing take another and if that comes out neg again call the doctors|`|AA12060541	if you don't want a baby, you should have worried long before now
FWkLDcqOaa	Wow. Senior citizens? That's gross, haha.<br>  But i've experienced stuff like that with older teens through like 30 year olds. It happens, but there isn't much you can do. As long as they don't try anything, i just take it as a compliment and smile, because there is no point on getting worked up over ignorant pigs.<br>  Plus, one of my teachers is a total creeper and is always hitting on the girls.

I am allowed to have a myspace, they know, I make out with boys, they know, i do a lot of things and they know.

I was disgusted and overwhelmed. I DIDN'T want ice cream anymore.

lV3Hk7M1aa	If you are on your period, you are not pregnant. You are probably just bloated, and back pain is part of being on your period. It could be stress or emotional eating. And if you don't drink that many liquids, and you're peeing a lot, you could be dehydrating. Drink more water, it will make you pee a lot at first, but if you make it habitual, your body will get used to having the proper amount of water and you should start peeing less.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	no but you can have vaginal bleed and mistake it for period or may be is old blood from your last period........|`|a1uoxczTaa	I have been asking this question also just because I am TTC, but i got my period. It is a little different than usual, a little shorter and a tad bit of a different color here and there. so i have been looking it up like CRAZY. you can NOT  have a period while pregnant but you can have what seems like a period. early pregnancy bleeding, vaginal bleeding, and implantation bleeding. I have seen so many ladies say they had their period during pregnancy that i am guessing that one of the these three things resembled their period ALOT. though implantation bleeding is more like spotting then a real period. (it is lighter/ not as much blood) hope this helps?|`|dNlCfhD2aa	If you are currently having your period and it is not lighter then usual, no you are not pregnant.  You are experiencing PMS symptoms.  Bloating, being emotional, cramps, backaches etc.<br>  If you are "too young" to be pregnant then you are also too young to be having sex.|`|T1LdAIabaa	you can have a period and still remain pregnant.  its not very common but it can happen.  the first one on most women is the implantation bleeding but infrequently some women may continue|`|FhMP2KZLaa	Yes
DHyUnhS1aa	Why do men have one night stands and never care enough to find out if a child was the result?|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Giving birth to a baby is the natural consequence to having sex. I don't see what other choice they would have other than abortion which isn't an option for the vast majority of people, even those that are po-choice. Both parents made the decision to have sex and should be held accountable for the care of the baby although situations aren't always ideal and sometimes mom and dad need help providing for a while.  It's irresponsible and stupid to get pregnant in such a situation although after a baby is conceived the best interest of the baby needs to be the focus, not punishing the mom and dad for bad decisions.|`|F8KmTbqjaa	You do not need two parents to have a happy home full of love.................end of story.|`|DeXRWlR6aa	Maybe they should have thought about that before they had sex. Even if you do your best to use protection, protection fails. If you aren't man enough or woman enough to take care of and raise a child, you probably shouldn't be having sex anyway.|`|11f8c2acef2ca75ea704f2ffd97b264eaa	one word for women like this: trifling|`|tVqLmImUaa	Totally feel you here. The fact of life is, sadly, that females truly do hold a lot of power over men in this situation. As you said, it's their body, so they get to call the shots. <br>  <br>  Sure, sometimes it's mutual irresponsibility with contraception, but there are SO many cases when a woman claims to be on the pill, and "forgets" to take it, nevermind the fact that it is not just her own life she might irrevocably change, but three lives. And there ain't nothing a guy can do about it.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, they might bring a child into the world because <br>  a) they really want a baby regardless (selfishness)<br>  b) they don't believe in abortion<br>  c) they get welfare so don't feel a father is necessary<br>  d) nature - they can play the "it's my body" card|`|Yt6LmBnfaa	No matter what the circumstances are (good or bad) some women just don't believe in abortion and would rather bring the child into the world regardless of the situation at hand. And since we are in the year 2009 we all know that there is a vast majority of single mothers raising and supporting their children without help from the dad.|`|RhHv5pYwaa	It is 2009 and we all know that if you sleep with someone there is a possibility of getting a STD, becoming pregnant. As an adult you have to be willing to except those responsibility and do right by them. Now if the man didn't want to put himself at that risk he should have thought about that. If he caught something he would have to deal with that. It sucks but it's the truth|`|dMLLQruOaa	Regardless of whether or not you are "not trying to make babies" sex can result in a baby. And just because the person was irresponsible one night, doesnt mean that they want to be irresponsible with all of their decisions, especially with a baby. Single parents can make great parents. And excuse me, if you dont want to pay child support keep your pants on. Its always a risk to get pregnant with birthcontrol, condoms, spermicide, etc. You both take the risk so you both pay the price. It is her body and she should do what she wants, but the night of the "one night stand" that may have led to the pregnancy, the guy did what he wanted too. Sorry to be harsh but it takes 2 to tango. And a parent should not be scorned for taking responsibility for their actions. Those who dont should.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ***When i say "YOU" or "YOUR" i am of coarse not talking to you. I am stating hypothetically. Not attacking you.
xsq9vT7Eaa	I had missed two periods and did a home pregnancy test which was negative so went to a doctor to see why I had missed my periods and it turned out it was because of weight loss, he explained to me that even slight stress easily stops periods!<br>  If you are really not sure go to a doctor and ask for a test I am going back  as I have missed another period and want to make sure I am not pregnant as the tests the doctors can do are way more reliable and if you are not pregnant you should go to a dr. anyway and just see whats going on.<br>  trust me they are r.ally supportive and lets face it its better ti be safe than sorry :) <br>  good luck.|`|AA11086563	Go to a your doctor.

You might not be pregnant  and it can be something else.|`|XpfGuOcQaa	It can be because of a few reasons. Weight loss, stress, medication... I recommend getting it checked out though.
WwcUHjeMaa	Put on a loose shirt firstly.<br>  Than put a smallish pillow over that, and duct tape it to the shirt.<br>  Then put a tighter shirt above it and wear a belt tucking the shirt into the pants.<br>  <br>  This is what I did, and it worked great.<br>  The loose shirt is to make sure the tape doesn't stick to your skin, and pull.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|QQby0Adoaa	Aside from the obvious - get a belly.  <br>  <br>  Pregnant women have a glow and joy about them.  I don't know what it really is but if you need to look pregnant you need to look completely happy cuz "your bringing a new life into the world".  It's the peaceful smile and calming effect pregnant women give a room.  <br>  <br>  It's kinda hard to write down, go to the maternity ward at the hospital and just watch the women there, they have a peaceful happyness about them, that's what your going for.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|E0SJx3Csaa	take a small throw pillow, attach string, yarn or a spandex band if some sort to each side of the pillow, the place the pillow on your lower abdomen and tie the string n the back so that it stays on. go to Goodwill and get a pair of maternity pants, or you can buy them at kmart for like 20 $, or wear a dress.|`|bTlhBX3daa	There are plastic or rubber belly's that you can get from costume shops and those would be the best for a realistic shape. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, a smaller pillow would work, especially if you sew the corners in. My boss used that last Halloween when my department dressed up as pregnant ladies (because I was pregnant). Work with it until it looks convincing.|`|a67f223481e1f00da8ea5d7d5f8d576caa	Get a couch pillow... if round you are good to go, if not kinda mold the corners in and under a bit.  Wear stretch pants that are snug.  A large sweater or top (get one on clearance at Old Navy) will do the trick.  Sit with legs kinda far apart, walk leaning slightly back and "absently" rub your belly occasionally.  Hand on lower back giving a slight rub is really common for me right now as well.  You may want to stuff your bra a bit to give a more maternal, round appearance.  Women toward the end tend to get pretty worn out so don't get too made up.  Seriously though, remember to lean back... arch your back and compensate for the "extra weight".  Waddle a bit too... you will want to practice.  I did this in high school and creeped my dad out.  haha|`|7D4Czk0faa	if youve even seen baby-mama (which is hilarious!) the blonde girl uses a fake stomache thing that you pump to make your tummy bigger. use something like that!|`|JSBPfpjtaa	you insert baby into your belly.|`|Kiu6BLbgaa	Go to a costume shop. Take a round pillow and put it under your shirt.|`|8eO12rl4aa	At maternity stores, they have special shaped pillows you can put on to make yourself look more pregnant.  I don't know how you'd get one.  The issue is that not all pregnant people look alike.  Some people gain weight and 'carry' all over.  Others are all belly.  The 'all belly' is probably the most mimicked look.  If you can't get a pregnancy pillow, you can try using other pillows - like maybe a round flat pillow and something more like a semi-circle.  Use a t-shirt or towel to round off the edges and/or tape them together and either tape them or belt them to an undershirt.  And remember you don't have to look like you're 9 months pregnant - you can have a smaller (5-6 month) belly too.  Oh, and the waddle doesn't start until later in the pregnancy.|`|5oCikIfMaa	try to go to a costume shop they might have something I no they have a beer belly in our joke shop all it is is a round piece of material which is filled up with wool and it straps around you with adjustable straps|`|1s3nddaYaa	can you find one of them pregnant thingys, that you put on your body, see if you can rent one somewhere?|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	hmmm at first i didnt understand your question - i am pregnant and i look it...lol<br>  <br>  try a soft ball maybe like a yoga ball under a long t-shirt<br>  <br>  or a pregnant women suit...|`|yKS2UI87aa	A small round pillow or go to a Maternity shop and look at one of belly's they have for reference. (they are pillows that go under clothing to see how it will look on you while you are pregnant)|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Have you checked out any costume shops? Most have a "pregnant lady" suit or something similar. <br>  <br>  Another option is to use a rounded pillow and practice waddling...|`|kT7GVOosaa	maternity clothes always help and then just pillows or anything round you can tie to your belly.|`|AgzRyqWTaa	drink lots of liquid,or eat a big lunch,stick your stomach out,no girdle.

DNygQdmVaa	Its the same as being an unteen mother.<br>  Im married and out of school, so im not like the younger teen moms.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	ill do the same things that a regular mom does, of course im out of high school and married so i dont know if im really a "teen mom"...but im 18 so technically i am..|`|776cf4cc9dc31fae3b35bd08e9ead34eaa	Gosh, well, everything that an 'of age' mother has to do, but with the added pressures of usually still being in school, figuring out how you're going to go to college, you'll drastically reduce the time with your friends, you may be 'judged' by other, you lack life experience, etc. So there is a lot in being a teen mom. I'm 23, married, and TTC. I couldnt imagine not being in a healthy, committed, relationship where we both want this child.|`|f4d85845a950087316840c62c9b31c06aa	I was a teen mom. I didn't finish school on time, even though I was living at home with my mother because everyone was gone during the day and didn't want to have to watch a baby when she came home so no night school for me. I finished about 6 years later. Had to depend on my parents to drive me everywhere. My mom had to buy everything for my baby because I couldn't get a babysitter to watch the baby so I couldn't get a job and even though the father was around, he wasn't contributing any of the things my son needed. So it was just me and my son at home all day everyday. That was my life for the first year of his life.|`|sq9AtIRHaa	It's like being a regular mother I guess. It depends what age you are..if you have your license, live with your parents, etc. I have my permit & am soon getting my license and it makes things much easier. It also helps having my baby daddy/boyfriend with me too. He's very helpful and understanding. I had to drop out of school when I became pregnant because it was just too difficult for me, and I am going to get my GED as soon as I do my paperwork. I'm also legally emancipated from my parents house and live with my boyfriend in our own home, so makes things much less complicated than it would living at my parents house. I found out I was pregnant when I was 14, had my baby boy when I was 15, and I am now 16 with a 1 year old. I wouldn't change it for a thing.|`|9zwSclnLaa	Well, obviously it's hard.  Even harder then normal motherhood is.  Because if you are younger then 16 you have to finish school and even if you drop out you probably have to work long hours at a demanding job just to earn minimum wage because you don't have a high school degree.  So imagine all of that on top of paying child care and trying to find time to actually raise your child.  All with the drama and problems of still being a "child" yourself.<br>  <br>  That is teen parenthood in a nutshell.|`|VBlrL1puaa	Being a teenage mom is hard!!!! I got pregnant with my daughter when i was 16, her dad and i were together for 2 years and we never fought and everyone thought it was forever, but when i got pregnant everything changed; he changed. He was in and out the entire pregnancy but wasnt there when i had my c-section, which is a scary thing all in itself, and just left the picture entirely. I graduated high school when i was 16 and now i am in college, almost done with my first year, at 17 and its really really really hard. Im home with the baby all day just to go to school till 1130 at night and come home get to bed at 1230 to wake up at 5 with the baby. Yes i occasionally go out with friends, but thats only if my daughter doesnt cry when i leave. Its really difficult. My parents help me out financially considering i have no time to work between school and the baby, but you go straight from being a child to being thrown into the adult world. You feel like there is no place for yourself because you are too mature to hang around people your own age, yet too immature to hang out with older adults. It's very stressful and very confusing most of the time, but in the end my little girl makes everything worth it. You have to try 3 times as hard as any other mother because you have to prove to your baby and the world that you aren't another statistic of being some high school drop out who pawns their baby off on their parents or friends. You have to prove to your baby that you are 1000000% capable of being a great mother if not better than any other mom out there no matter what age.|`|k3sL7mZtaa	I had my son when I was 17 and my fiance was 16. I went back to my high school when he was 5 weeks old and I just graduated in January. It was hard going to school and being a Mom at the same time. I felt that I was missing out on so many things and I felt guilty leaving him every morning.<br>  No matter how old you are, being a Mom is full-time work and exhausting but it's worth every minute of it. They aren't always the cute, smiling little bundles of joy you see on tv, but he's my world and I wouldn't change anything. <br>  I'm happy to say that everything is going great for us. I have graduated, my fiance is graduating soon, and then we're both going into the RCMP. Not every teen parent is that lucky.|`|U3RCBmKJaa	im 18 and have a 1 year old son its hard even withh the man around i have been married for 3 years yes i got married at 15 and we have been seperated for a year almost in june and you cant do anything and if you do you have to take the baby with you goog luck i finished school and in college and leaving for the army in june just take it how it comes i wouldnt change anything in the world for my little boy|`|mSJwKrQIaa	See, i've always wondered the exact same question.. what's it like?

tfaUNlvtaa	Yes, but using their egg and sperm. Being selfish I wouldn't want the child to be a part of me or my husband. I also think it needs to be for the right couple. I don't know if you watched the surrogacy programme last night but I think it's important to have a good relationship with the parents to be for both parties sakes. <br>  <br>  Having said all this I really don't like being pregnant so it's unlikely to ever be something I would consider. I also believe that a child is a child and if you are unable to have your own that there are plenty that need a good home through adoption. Great question!|`|d5fd9d057a20f9f41b37d39a5288a98faa	I would love it if I was able to do that, especially if my sister asked me, but I am pregnant now, and the bond I feel for my baby is strong and I can't imagine being bonded like this, then having to say goodbye after 9+ months together...

I am just not that strong, but I am glad there is strong woman out there to do this for so many woman because without them, many families would not have children they have now.|`|de2a2663fe4b3d02deeeda407aee1db1aa	Would love to. I love carrying children. I loved carrying mine and wouldn't mine carrying someone elses. I would have 20 children if I didnt have to raise them. Pregnancy for me was a great exp. each time. even with the rough ones. I can't do it because I am a smoker. Although I didnt smoke during pregnancy I dont think you can be a surrogate if you smoke at all. I don't hink you can give anyone a better gift than someone who wants a child can't concieve and you hand them there lifelong dream. I don't know but something about it woudl seem so satisfying to me.|`|DtU1EpoVaa	depends who for my sister yes and close friend yes but someone I didn't know no I could as I would not know for sure they if they would be great parents not saying everyone that has kids are but if am going to bring a child into the world for someone I would need to know for sure they are going to love it and give it the best life they can and I would need to trust them 100% that's why I would only do it for someone am close too|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Honestly? Personally I couldn't do it. I have bonded so tightly with my baby, and the thought of carrying someone else's baby is hard. I can't imagine handing over a child that I carried for 9 + months.

XD|`|DJpS9GDxaa	I gaze out the window when I'm not directly horizontal <br>  <br>  :)|`|AA10673927	I usually close my eyes or stare at the ceiling and count something.<br>  <br>  [:|`|nfLyS1toaa	i stare at the ceiling. i feel weird looking at them|`|S4y7V4diaa	Stare at the person|`|wqRwSaGSaa	i watch and then close my eyes.|`|n3h9Byhpaa	Close my eyes<br>  :D I just like chill there and doze off|`|yKS2UI87aa	Clamp my eyes shut and grab hold of the arms of the chair til my knuckles turn white.

nfzQkvqraa	We have two kids (3 and 7) and a yard full of neighborhood kids in the spring/summer.<br>  <br>  We have a swing set, a seesaw, two inflatable bouncers (because the 1st one broke and the co. sent us a new one.  We then patched the 1sst one)  We have a barbie jeep and a hot wheels jeep.  We have a couple of bins of balls and smaller outside toys.  We have a soccer net for my daughter.  We also have a slip and slide and an inflatable pool.  We're pretty much set outside because we spend MUCH of our time out there in the summer.|`|XOtOMncwaa	I don't have any, sad I know. But when i moved here my car got broken into, so I wont even put a flower pot or a chair on my front porch because I'm afraid someone will steal it. But hopefully our house will be done this summer, it will be on a farm, so I can feel free to put stuff outside again. My son does have a pool, and a power wheels, but it comes back in the house with me when he's done with it. And I am putting a swing set outside this summer, hopefully no one loads it up in the back of their truck!|`|W8UZebRWaa	We just moved from having the worlds smallest backyard to having a big one so we are still buying.At the moment we just got a Step 2 climber with slide, lots of lawn tools and ride on toys.<br>  **I'm freaked about people stealing our stuff too! You never know|`|KmC0K59taa	Ours will be 2 next month.  She has a swingset, a blow up pool, a tricycle, a little push lawnmower and a sandbox with toys.|`|JtbeH1Mgaa	My kids are 3 & 4.

This summer we plan on putting a sand box, swing set, slipping slide and a pool in the yard.  They also have a jump-o-lene that will go outside once it gets warmer.  We have quiet a bit but between my two kids and my best friends 2 kids & 5 young brothers we will 9 kids here at the house playing this Summer.|`|5rdiZvYEaa	We have a large inground pool.

s4LWmcTjaa	My toddler likes the ravioli.  We don't give it to him often, but I don't see anything wrong with it.<br>  <br>  As far as it being a processed food.... well processed food is just part of life for most people.  I ate it as a child and my husband ate it as a child and our kids eat it sometimes and we are all fine.  <br>  <br>  Did you know there is a full serving of vegetables in Chef Boyardee now?  And you off set it with a fruit and some calcium.  I think your son had a well rounded dinner.<br>  <br>  The only thing I don't like about Chef is the salt content.  But like I said, it's fine in moderation.  Heck even I crack open a can of Chef every now and then! :)|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Every once in a while, we will.  Certainly not every day, but there's nothing wrong with a treat & a convenience from time to time.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I've never eaten it, my ex used to love it though and the few times I got a whiff of it, it put me permanently off. I'm all for fast dinners, I just don't care for the chef.<br>  <br>  I freely admit to giving her a frozen stouffers mac n cheese dinner though. I've done that a couple times when dinner just didn't work out.|`|j2mRop0laa	My kids don't really like it so much.. but after I had my daughter, I ate 2 cans of 98% fat free CHEESE ravioli a day (and nothing else because it filled me up so extremely) and lost tons of weight. They quit selling it here. *Sigh*<br>  I miss those days when the weight just dripped off...|`|01Mu3wUeaa	He doesn't like it so I will just make him pasta.<br>  <br>  I will eat it every once in a while but try not too because the ravioli meat looks kinda funky.|`|a8IRxC4raa	::::Gag:::::::::<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|jSPj3S6faa	Please take it from me: feed your kids what they like.  If you feel that you must introduce new foods, do it VERY gently and be prepared for many rejections.<br>  <br>  I am pretty sure that no child has died and developed some horrible illness because they ate things that weren't "natural".<br>  <br>  But I do know some children that develop tremendous tummyaches from parents pressuring them to eat certain foods.<br>  <br>  I know because I was an extremely picky eater for the first twenty years of my life.  Now because of the love of my wife and other events of maturation, I can eat just about anything.  And even though I ate poorly for so long as a developing child, I am still alive and kickin' today at the age of 54.|`|nfzQkvqraa	For lunches sometimes.  I TRY to stay away from canned food as much as possible, but we aren't perfect right?  My kids LOVE the beefaroni.|`|jLYTKr33aa	No, we don't feed that stuff to our son.  We prefer the Annie's Organic kind if we're going to go with an "emergency" meal.  But I will admit that Beefaroni is freaking awesome!|`|TQ47vny4aa	My little girls just love that stuff. I usually have to sit down with them while they eat the spaghetti and I will eat the ravioli.|`|xVEqBjDVaa	Kids LOVE it, i lived off it when i was little lol. They like the beef ravioli.|`|W8UZebRWaa	Sometimes my son will take a few bites of mine. I love that stuff! I haven't fed it to him as a meal (he's younger than yours) but I grew up on it.|`|S4y7V4diaa	Once in a rare while when I was little my mom would give it to me, it was those once in a blue moon things though|`|JnLoHaoAaa	My daughter has had it a couple times and doesn't seem to mind it. It's good in a pinch for a meal|`|dMLLQruOaa	I think its an okay like 1x-2x a week dinner. Its great for the young ones. I had it when i was growing up as well. I dont see a problem with it. I am all for eating healthy but there is nothing wrong with an occasional canned meal.:)<br>  <br>  ** Sure everyone gets a thumbs down for eating a food. Its funny how people judge even the types of food that people may or may not eat.
HUQQzph2aa	I'm always craving something sweet (my downfall with eating healthy). Lately it has been Peeps, Easter candy...I'm not pregnant either haha.|`|HoonZJMgaa	(First of all Mr. Awesome you don't seem so awesome at all to me. But that's just my opinion.) Your body needs calcium that's why you are craving dairy. And if a pregnant woman eats alot her baby needs the nutrients and she should eat until she is content!|`|SwoRqEZvaa	let your hubby get the ice cream...shoot...i think i might send mines for some cookies and cream...or pistachio...(drool)|`|ncUhlwevaa	You want ice cream.|`|5IlaGPxUaa	All the time....<br>  <br>  <br>  I have cravings all the time and i didnt even Get cravings when I WAS pregnant lol<br>  <br>  Argghhh I sometimes Need things and well i just go get them....I dont know what it is|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Possible PMS I guess? Or you may need calcium...
dgRTkccBaa	Just get him new toys, and overnight while he's sleeping put the new toys out and take the old ones away so he can't see them.  He'll be so busy with the new stuff that he won't even notice the old ones are gone and eventually he'll forget about them.
JtbeH1Mgaa	Someone should use a wooden spoon on them and see how they like it.  That's uncalled for in my opinion.|`|BEYNzIfiaa	Spanking with a hand is discipline, but using an instrument of any kind is torture. It doesn't matter how mad a parents gets, they need to realize that their children are molded by every action. And children are more likely to remember traumatic events.|`|SX9zoVEQaa	I'd rather get spanked with a wooden spoon then be grounded.<br>  <br>  Think about it, a spanking hurts, you cry, you get lectured...  You get a hug, and parent and child are happy again...  Not some long drawn out punishment that ends up hindering the rest of the family.  <br>  <br>  As long as a spanking is ALWAYS on the butt, then yes a spanking is fine.|`|wTNsIqe2aa	Same here, experienced it in childhood. It is blatantly obvious to me that this is child abuse. You do that to an adult in public and you could be arrested for assault. It's not a normal thing to do to a child. Hitting them teaches them to hit, it instills fear in them.. it will affect the rest of their LIFE. There are other ways to discipline children. I can't imagine ever laying a finger on my child. Why would you ever strike someone you love? It's abuse.|`|LSJyE4d0aa	I do not necessarily think that it is abuse, however, I think it is unnecessary. I am a firm believer in spanking, but my husband and I only use our open hand to spank our girls, and they have to be really acting out to get a spanking.|`|pPKhVRXJaa	an open hand across the child's bottom is all that is needed for an effective spanking.|`|I9BJPhITaa	alittle extreme,  <br>  over the knee, palm to butt is a spanking.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	They are abusive. They should have grown up and acquired patience before having children.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	My opinion of them is that they are a bit on the extreme side with spanking.  It's not what I would ever do with my kids, but I have no place to judge.<br>  <br>  My husband got the belt growing up and he has a great relationship with his parents and he is a wonderful husband and father.  You can't always say that someone who spanks with a wooden spoon or belt or what have you is automatically a bad parent.  But I do believe that a belt, wooden spoon or any other object other than your hand is a bit over kill for spanking.|`|W8UZebRWaa	Horrible. I had one used on me and it was torture. I don't allow them in my house now because of the mental stigma attached to them. They hurt so bad and just do not need to be used.<br>  **Yes they do break after a while.<br>  ***You don't get a spank and a hug. I remember getting beaten with it then grounded. Its never ok|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	Spanking with an open palm is discipline. Spanking with a wooden spoon is abuse.|`|MVgm17o3aa	abuse!! I believe in spanking with a hand but not an object.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Abuse.|`|zqfs7A6Caa	There are several reasons a parent may use an object such as a wooden spoon for spanking.<br>  <br>  Many people do not like to use their hand for spanking because they do not want their children to fear their hand. If tensions are running high, sometimes a child may feel s/he has done something even if s/he hasn't. A parent doesn't want the child to flinch if they are only trying to give the child a hug.  <br>  <br>  Another reason is that using an object such as a wooden spoon prevents spur-of-the-moment spankings which can often be administered out of anger. A quick hand spanking may be given before a parent realizes that the child did not actually do something wrong.<br>  <br>  The parent has to go into another room and retrieve the spoon while the child thinks about what s/he has done and anticipates the consequence. The parent also has a chance to take a breath and clear their head so that they do not overpunish. <br>  <br>  I have never used anything other than my hand, but my son is only 3. I usually stop and take a breath first unless the offense is obvious (exp. trying to flush underwear down the toilet after being warned an hour beforehand). But for some parents, I can understand using a spoon (or spatula, belt, etc.) and don't hold it against them. <br>  <br>  Using an object to spank doesn't automatically make it abusive. Striking a child wildly on different parts of their body is abuse (dangerous). Calling a child names or screaming while spanking is abuse (emotional). Causing cuts or bruises is abusive (injurious). A spanking given for a good reason that causes nothing more than temporary redness and a lesson learned, is discipline whether given by hand, paddle, switch, sandal, or wooden spoon.|`|6nUprmu5aa	Not okay. Spanking should only be done with the hand and only be done when a child does something really extreme(hitting or spitting on others). I don't understand why people think they NEED to use other objects to spank. A spanking is a spanking and if the hand isn't working, they need to move on to a different method of punishment, not a worse form of the same one.|`|AA11624887	I believe that if you are going to spank you kid, it should not be with anything stronger than a open hand.  Not sticks, spoons, wires, or closed fists.|`|XKYP0sGQaa	I think that using a wooden spoon is too extreme.<br>  <br>  It, in my opinion, really is unnecessary and I am sure would be considered child abuse.|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	I think that using any kind of object is wrong.  You don't need to use a weapon on your kids.|`|6Z4fKZ8aaa	Nothing wrong with it as long as you don't leave marks or broken bones.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	its not necessary to use a weapon|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	it will break, use teflon
993828fb52767f45cfd24d17879210e5aa	Don't worry first of all. Just make sure he gets on unemployment RIGHT AWAY!!! Their process is kind of long so it can take a few weeks to get your money. Make sure he goes out and searches for jobs everyday, even if doesn't want to work there. You guys need money so he can't be picky about where he works. Get on food stamps. And most importantly, try to save every penny that you can. That way when the baby comes and he/she needs a check up you can. Use the saving money instead of the money used for  bills.  Just be careful with your money and you will be okay!  Oh and if you do have money left over after you paid your  bills and put some into saving, buy things you will need once the baby comes (diapers, formula, clothes, etc. ) and try to stock up on that kind of stuff.|`|dq9uclgpaa	Hang in there Girlie! Remember god is your #1 source, unless your atheist. Pray to god and he'll make things better. Just keep your faith and stay strong. Encourage you fiance to try and find another job. Tell him to just think of being laid off as an opportunity to experience new jobs.  Be very understanding which I believe your doing perfectly. and don't worry things will turn around soon, just stay positive!|`|9QVjNaIPaa	collect unemployment and closely monitor your spending to try to save on as much as possible. dont use as much electric, water, gas etc so your bills will go down. have a yard sale to get rid of odds n ends you dont need. start saving cans. maybe he can do some work on the side for now like washin cars, mowing lawns, etc. it will be hard but you should still be able to make it off of the unemployment as long as you watch your spending. hopefully he'll get work again soon.|`|a67f223481e1f00da8ea5d7d5f8d576caa	Get on WIC immediately because unemployed and pregnant you qualify.  I believe they will approve you and give you extra while pregnant.  This will also be a great help once baby arrives.  You have paid into taxes and until the situation resolves look into every program available.  No shame is using what is there for us to use.  Only shame when abusing the system and the people who do usually have no idea what shame is.  26 will be good to you... keep your focus positive for you and baby.  It makes more of a difference than can be imagined.  Many women with graves are fine.  Your doctors will carefully monitor you anyway.  I think Kelp helps.  Double check but I was given some to use and it helps with iron levels as well.  This happened with my husband when our daughter was not yet 2.  I had just turned 27 and it was that day he told me he thought it would happen and sure enough, the day after my birthday he was laid off.  Unemployment immediately, welfare and WIC, etc.  You are early enough in your pregnancy where you may be able to get work again for the duration unless you are still having complications.  If you are then ask your doctor to put you on temporary disability so you can get some help.<br>  <br>  Make sure you do some calm, deep breathing every day.  Think about what you are grateful for (my 8 year old does better with everything when she keeps up her gratitude journal... so do I!), think of beautiful places you enjoy, think of your baby... and remember if you are led to it you will be carried through it.  Those months my husband was out of work were some of the hardest AND some of the most rewarding I have ever experienced.  It is good to learn to let go.<br>  <br>  You will be okay, I will pray for you too!<br>  <br>  Jen almost 32 weeks pregnant and counting down!|`|ddS7unC2aa	If you and your other half stick together through all of this everything will be ok. Just think of this as a test of your love. Whatever you do try not to argue over money.  My husband and I have had hard times during a few of our pregnancies and we stuck together and tried not to let all the stress come between us. To this day we are still going strong. When we felt like we were at the bottom of the pit we always reassured each other that there was someone else out there that was in a worse position than us. Strangely that made us feel better.|`|fff3c3d8688e389a4670babefc9db6ebaa	I feel bad for you. I got laid off in December, right before Christmas. Times are rough for all of us right now. I'm sure your husband will find something else. He could try fast food or something. I never thought I would work in or like fast food, but that's what I did. It's not bad at all and it pays the bills.<br>  <br>  Also, when I lost my job, I knew we were going to need to cut back on stuff, so I lowered as many bills as I could (Internet, TV, etc).<br>  <br>  If you are the praying type, you should pray about it. It helps.|`|YptDN02vaa	apply for food stamps and unemployment im sure they'll give it to you because your pregnant|`|RjXcp9PSaa	I myself am 26 and pregnant...due in May...my pregnancy has not been an easy one either. I had Graves disease that was taken care of thru surgery but it brought on diabetes so I can understand your frustration. Your pregnancy is high risk just like mines, my advice to you is stay calm, take your meds ( PTU is the nastiest medicine) worse than green Nyquil...and keep moving forward...I know easier said than done but i understand your feelings. This is my 3rd child and my mom wont be with me...she passed last year and i have been heartbroken since, but i kept moving forward, your fiances job loss is not really a loss but a chance for him to assess his career field. You can help by help by job hunting with him and offering words of encouragement. Also now is a good time to get creative and save. Have quiet romantic dinners at home instead of a fancy restaurant, do your nails at home,etc...but relax all will get better...good luck|`|lJc9elfpaa	I am somewhat in the same situation. We weren't exactly planning on getting pregnant, but we did. My husband was working as self- employed in the construction business making great money but the economy is so bad he has NO work. We just bought a house based on both our incomes  so we cannot make it on my salary alone. He just got a job working retail making squat but we are managing. My best advice is to stay calm. It's not good for you or your baby to stress out. Cut back where you can in finances (no eating out, buy the cheap meats like chicken tender meat and ground turkey, apply for food stamps, etc if you can and cancel cable, internet, other extraneous amenities). It's not going to be like this for long. He will get a new job, you may find an easier job and in the end you will look back and laugh. Plenty of people end up in this situation and make it out alive. Think of your precious baby and the dreams of the future!
2F5HNPqPaa	Lukas is 6 months and has no teeth (nor any sign of any) either!  <br>  <br>  He's been having Farley's rusks since he was 5 months now (they're nice, big and chunky so they don't break up... he just chews and sucks and they melt in his mouth).<br>  <br>  He also loves rice cakes.  Again, chewing and sucking make them soggy enough to swallow!  <br>  <br>  Like these: <a href="http://www.walmart.com/search/search-ng.do?search_query=rice+cakes&search_constraint=0&tc=0&ic=48_0&ref=+418721.419329&tab_value=19_All" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/search/search-ng....</a><br>  <br>  I also sometimes give him bits of crusty bread to chew on or dry toast... not much goes in, but it's all practise for now anyway.  <br>  <br>  You can also try banana (cut into fingers rather than circular slices though... easier for babies), and cooked fruits and veg like apple, pear, carrots etc.  A friend of mine said her daughter loved cucumber and it really helped when she was teething!<br>  <br>  Also, I know loads of babies (my son included) who happily chomp away on finger foods without teeth for months!  Their gums are pretty strong and it really is more about practise at first.  (Bear in mind even when they have a couple of teeth, they're usually the front ones and not used for chewing anyway!)|`|GpdYgi4Zaa	my friend has 2 daughters her youngest is 9months now. but ever since she could hang onto things and started feeding herself with her hands she ate those zwieback toasts and they were fine.

703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	I mostly stopped using mine when my daughter wanted to walk rather than be carried.  She was over a year old.  Even then, I used it at times--like when we were in a crowd and I didn't want her to get trampled or wander off.  My husband still carries her (at 21 months) in the Ergo on occasion, but I am pregnant and it's not quite so comfortable anymore for me.  I think it's great you're still using it.  I assume you know about the hip carry position?  Six months is a good time to transition to it, and it takes a TON of weight off your shoulders.|`|f298053ebd42df4c5da5f85a6ead96d4aa	I stopped using the sling around 4 months and 16-17 lbs, and I used a carrier with two straps so her weight was distributed over both shoulders. I used a mei tai or a wrap until she was about 15 months, and wanted to walk everywhere! Occasionally, she (22 months old) still pulls out the sling or mei tai and asks to "ride."|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	My girl is 13 months and about 20lbs and I still use my Maya ring sling and recently bought and Ergo carrier.

He was small for his age (around 18 lbs then) and I carried him regularly, so it took a long time for him to feel too heavy to carry.  We "graduated" to a backpack style carrier for a few months since it balanced his weight more easily while keeping little hands out of my way, but I finally needed him in a stroller by the time he was about 1 1/2 years old.|`|mEsMBOH9aa	I had a nice big padded one, so I continued to sling my daughter on my hip or back til she hit about 35lbs - lots easier than carrying her!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	My sling was too hard on my back as my son got bigger, maybe around 7-8 months although I still occasionally use it at 12 months for short trip. I got an Ergo carrier and use that more now, it's been great.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	my daughter is 5 months so I'm still using it with her, my son was definitely able to walk when I was still using my larger sling with him, once he got too heavy to carry in front I moved him to my hip and then onto my back, it was a lot easier to carry the sling in the car then the stroller so I used it a lot.
AA10807944	I used Boots when my two got out of newborn sizes, never had a problem and there was always lots of 3 for 2 offers on nappies and wipes. also the points are good in Boots so a few little treats for Mum too!|`|HztriBPAaa	My husband is an engineer and he had this discussion with one of the guys who makes the material used in diapers. All the absorbency material is the same the only difference between the name brands and the store brands is shape. Depending on your baby's shape you may find the store brands actually fit better. I would buy a small package of the ones you are thinking about and test them out. Hope that helps.|`|XdSWfpe7aa	you can try different brands, but be carefully ur baby's skin is sensitive..he/she might not like it and develop diaper rash...my baby used to have a lot of rashes when he was born, i switched his baby wipes to pampers sensitive ones.. it works great...i used to use the one from costco...now eventhough it's more expensive than the other im sticking to it.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	honestly, I used Sainsbury's on my son, who can typically even manage to leak in a pampers, and they were brilliant!<br>  <br>  They have exactly the same grips etc, and there was a great deal on at the time, a two for one offer, so I got two huge bags for ￡12.00.<br>  <br>  I change my mind between Pampers and Huggies, but I remember Tesco nappies being great from my first child, as there was a big Tesco near where we lived - they were just as good.  I have never tried boots nappies, I do like their wipes and cannot for one moment  imagine they are inferior in anyway to Pampers.  May not be much cheaper mind you!!|`|547cda86a737eee48c045921b9b5afa1aa	i used to get the non named brands in bulk from my local cash n carry. i couldnt afford pampers etc and these were just as good without the fancy labels|`|52bAHCaUaa	When my daughter was born she only had pampers(That's what the NICU uses) so when she came home they sent me home with a pack and when I had to buy my own I bought the Walmart brand. I hated them! The way they felt, everything. So I bought her some White Cloud, they are just a bit more, but a lot less than pampers, I seem to really like them! She sleeps through the night, and before she would almost always leak with the Walmart brand, but these hold up really well!|`|1a8da3900278db87f090619373273087aa	when it came to my daughter, i woukldnt risk anything apart from the old faithfull brands such as huggies. <br>  <br>  however, if i had my daughter during this financial struggle, i would have possibly tried the boots brand. something tells me a pharacies own brand would be more trustworthy than that of a supermarket chains.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I started off using pampers, but when he reached size 3 nappies I've started using Tesco ones.  They're just as good, he's leaked maybe twice, and that's been overnight when he sleeps 12 hours.  It's 3 packs for ￡10 so much cheaper!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Personally my daugther always leaked in Pampers and Huggies. I lived for Luvs for the first year and then I discovered that Target store brand was AWESOME! I like them better than any of the name brands out there.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	All babies are different, they way they fit, the leak protection, some babies get rashes easier with certain diapers...I used pampers and then switched to the costco brand, they worked great. I would suggest buying the smallest pack of the ones you want to try and see how they work before buying too many of them.|`|V8wUAVdyaa	I think the rule of thumb with diapers is that you get what you pay for.  I've never tried the brands you are talking about but most of the time it is worth the 3-5 extra dollars to get the better brand.  I use pampers swaddlers and they are perfect for my baby.|`|X8zRD86Vaa	i have to use huggies or pampers for my lil man.. all the other brands end up leaking and he ends up needing a change of clothes and a bath cause hes soaked in his own pee... so id rather use the pampers and huggies where they dont leak|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I tried parent's choice, huggies, and luvs. Pampers was the best choice for us as far as leakage protection and not irritating his skin. You just have to try them out and see what works best for your little one.|`|Ot1R3t5uaa	we swear by tesco's own brand. they knock spots off pampers and huggies. they are really good overnight and very absorbant.|`|MTF0Rz90aa	The nappies for your local supermarket are just as good as pampers, just cheaper.<br>  Ja.|`|z7YyYCYRaa	i've used pampers from day one, i shop at asda and they are always doing deals on brand nappies and also on baby wipes which i go through at some rate!!|`|OwLcbnTvaa	I dont no cos im in New Zealand haha<br>  I use treasures and huggies.<br>  I buy them from the supermarket, and they work fine!.
FL67UPPHaa	India Elizabeth Smith -- 7/10. I really like Elizabeth, it's a classic and timeless name. India is more modern, so I'm not sure the styles of the names go well together.

E2e485WRaa	You do not ovulate when you are on the pill.  That is what the pill does it prevents you from ovulating and thins your lining to prevent implantation.  Your cycle on the pill is manufactured by chemical hormones.  It is not your real cycle and you can not count it as such.  <br>  <br>  When you come off of the pill it may take time for your cycle to go back to what is normal for you.  Many times a woman's cycle  returns to what it was prior to ever being on the pill.  Some women do not ovulate when the first come off of the pill.  It can take a while.  It is different for everyone.  <br>  <br>  Unless you were charting your waking temp, or doing ovulation predictor kit or being closely monitored by an RE by blood work and ultrasounds through out your cycle there is no way to know when you actually did ovulate.  <br>  <br>  It is completely possible that you ovulated later than you thought.  Since she has been consistently dating the same from the very beginning and still does now, I would think that you did ovulate later than you think.|`|7c9a6ac2b60c434d81159b0728373573aa	No you can not get pregnant at anytime. If you have a perfect 28 day cycle then you got pregnant on the 14-15th day after the first day of your last period. Your ultrasounds are off because they track you conception date as the first day of your last period so there is a 14 day laps.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If all the ultrasounds have been saying the same thing their dates are more than likely correct. You may have ovulated late. You can ovulate at any time in a cycle and since you got off the pill that would have messed up your cycle...You dont' ovulate on hte pill so getting off of it made you ovulate...you just ovulated later. Totally normal for someone getting off birth control.|`|62vCoDPjaa	i was on the pill too when i got pregnant, and my periods were typically about 4 days long...and according to their dating on my ultrasounds i got pregnant the day after i got off my period.  i kinda doubt the correctness of my dating too.  its supposed to be two weeks before your period, but mine simply isnt the case...but i guess ill find out when she is born if they were close to being right or not!
OJFz0LBZaa	when i had mine done i was not allowed to eat or drink apart from water from 10 o'clock the night before, as it can alter the results of the test|`|kT7GVOosaa	I took it twice and both times I did the test in the morning. when you wake up (after sleeping for at least 8 hours) you are supposed to eat 2 pieces of toast and margarine, not butter only margarine, with a glass of milk. then be to the blood work place within 45 minutes of drinking the liquid. you need to know the exact time you finished the drink so your blood can be drawn exactly an hour later.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well I have had to take the 1 hour test twice and the 3 hour test twice and all times I just went to the lab (fasting...nothing after midnight)...drank the drink and got my blood drawn after an hour and for the three hour same thing but had blood drawn every hour for 3.|`|bTlhBX3daa	I had to fast for the 1 hour Glucose test. I recommend you do the same. If your levels show high (mine did), you will have to go back and do a 3 hour Glucose test after going on a special diet. It's not worth it, do whatever it takes to pass the first test.|`|5NBJUALFaa	I ate a half pound of lead fishing weights and a liter of mercury before my test.. The results were slightly skewed.|`|Wk7fIw4Laa	Usually if it is a fasting test, your doctor's office would tell you. You can either call them and have it done another day or just not eat or drink anything after midnight. But I recommend calling your doctor first.|`|cfdooGylaa	Yeah you're supposed to fast like 8 hours before the test, or at least thats how it was for me. Good luck.
4kyGIaZYaa	i was 129lbs at 5'8" im 36 wks at 184 now and its all baby, none in the thighs or butt or anywhere else, its 55 lbs different but you can't see it anywhere but my growing belly. no stretch marks either. it's a boy of course! but as long as your healthy and happy about where the weight is settling, then i wouldn't worry. but think about your postpartum body and what weight you want to be at. i am very active so im not worried about losing it. if you gain too much, your doc wil tell you bc when you gain weight, so does your baby. keep in mind about a too large baby for your frame and c-sections, along with gestational diabetes and future weight problems....|`|YuA7a08Maa	It sounds alright.  You're supposed to gain 25-35 pounds throughout the pregnancy.  You're still within that range!  I know a lot of women who gained 70-100 pounds.|`|HoonZJMgaa	It may be alot to some doctors but I say Eat and Be Merry! You are nurturing your baby and you can lose the weight when you deliver.|`|nRyTmxwSaa	I'm 5'4 and 22 weeks pregnant. I was 118lbs before and now weight 128lbs. I would say yes yours is good|`|UYfqzCoMaa	You've gained 26 lbs so far. They only want you to gain about 25-30 lbs during your whole pregnancy.|`|cfdooGylaa	26 lbs already? Wow. If your doctor hasn't said anything then you're probably fine. They say 25-30 lb weight gain throughout the whole pregnancy is ideal for a normal sized woman like yourself but it varies greatly from woman to woman. Good luck.
zSEJC6vZaa	If you are under 18, you typically need a work permit.  There is an age minimum for that as well, and I think it may vary depending on what state you live in.  <br>  <br>  If you can't get a work permit, baby sitting pays really well (if you are responsible, clean-cut, and like kids).  You could also try tutoring, dog-walking, or doing household chores for other people.  Make sure that your parents know who you will be working for and approve - there are a lot of weirdos out there and you need to be careful.<br>  <br>  When you do have a job, I recommend having your parents help you open a bank account to save your money in.  This way you can learn about writing checks and using ATMs.  This also helps you not to blow your money too quickly (trust me on this one).|`|gDEFlWnOaa	You can't really get a job.<br>  <br>  Ever at 16 you'll have trouble finding a job that "pays well."

When a circumcision is done, tissue which would normally be intact is split. Unless proper care is taken, the epithelium of the inner prepuce at the point where the foreskin was removed can reattach to the epithelium of the glans. The result of this is a penile adhesion. Usually the adhesions can be released by simple retraction. Sometimes, however, the fusion is so complete that simple retraction will not work, and the child must be referred to a urologist. Another problem is that smegma or bacteria can collect under the adhesion if it covers the preputial cavity and cause infection. Professionals must look for this problem, and parents must be taught how to care for the normal circumcised penis so that penile adhesions do not develop. This article discusses the formation and identification of penile adhesions, the process by which adhesions can be released, when a referral to a urologist is necessary and the proper care for the circumcised penis.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  To prevent the occurrence of penile adhesions, nurses and parents must be shown the proper technique of caring for the penis following a circumcision. Most nursing textbooks discuss the procedure and the initial care following a circumcision, which involves observation for bleeding and the application of Vaseline gauze or a lubricant and sterile gauze for 24 to 48 hours but do not discuss later retraction of the shaft skin.9-13 but usually this is all that they are taught. The penis looks different immediately following a circumcision than it does a few days later (at which time most babies are home from the hospital). With the swelling that occurs after a circumcision, the natural appearance of the shaft skin cannot be appreciated. The skin must heal after the circumcision and should not be retracted for approximately 10 to 14 days. However, the mother and the father must learn to pull back the shaft skin every day after the circumcision is healed so that the corona is free from any adherent skin. Another reason to retract the skin is to clean around the base of the glans, being certain to remove smegma and any other debris. Then the shaft skin should be returned to its original position, or a paraphimosis (constriction of the penis by the shaft skin) could occur.<br>  <br>  The technique of retraction can be taught to the parents while they are in the hospital. When the shaft skin is fully retracted, the glans should look like the top of a mushroom, with the corona and preputial cavity plainly visible. Oftentimes the edge of the corona has a purplish hue, and the parents can be told to look for this. Even though they cannot practice on their own child immediately following a circumcision, parents can practice the technique by any means the nurse finds helpful. One way might be to use two finger cots, one with the bottom removed and placed low on the finger, and the other rolled up and placed on the tip of that same finger. The lower cot can represent the shaft skin and the top can represent the glans and the corona. (To the authors knowledge, a practical model is not available.)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/AAP-care.h..." rel="nofollow">http://www.circumstitions.com/AAP-care.h...</a><br>  Does my son's foreskin need special cleaning?<br>  <br>  The uncircumcised penis is easy to keep clean. When your son is an infant, bathe or sponge him frequently and wash all body parts, including the genitals. You do not need to do any special cleansing, such as with cotton swabs or antiseptics. Simply wash the head of the penis and the inside fold of the foreskin with [mild!] soap and warm water. [Or rather, just wash the outside of the penis as a whole. The inner fold of the foreskin will look after itself.] Remember, do not try to forcibly retract the foreskin. You should watch your baby urinate to be sure that the hole in the foreskin is large enough to allow a normal stream. [You probably won't have much choice!] Consult your pediatrician if:<br>  <br>  * the stream of urine is never heavier than a trickle<br>  * your baby seems to have some discomfort while urinating.<br>  <br>  If the foreskin becomes inflamed, a common cause is the fungus monilia, which can cause redness and itching. This can be easily treated with an antifungal cream. If the foreskin becomes considerably red or swollen, see your pediatrician. If your son's foreskin is fully retracted before puberty, an occasional retraction with cleansing beneath will do. [He can do it himself.] Once your son starts puberty, he should retract the foreskin and clean beneath it on a daily basis. It should become a part of your son's total body hygiene, just like shampooing his hair and brushing his teeth. Teach your son to clean his foreskin by:<br>  <br>  * gently pulling it back away from the glans<br>  * rinsing the glans and inside fold of the foreskin with [mild] soap and warm water<br>  * [rinsing with water only]<br>  * pulling the foreskin back over the head of the penis.<br>  <br>  Caring for your son's uncircumcised penis requires no special action. Remember, foreskin retraction will occur naturally and should never be forced. Once boys begin to bathe themselves, they will need to wash their penis just as they do any other body part. [This excellent paragraph might have substituted for all the other worrisome advice before it.]<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vegfamily.com/babies-and-todd..." rel="nofollow">http://www.vegfamily.com/babies-and-todd...</a><br>  The self-cleaning functions of the intact penis are analogous to the self-cleaning properties of the eyelid.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.notjustskin.org/en/circumcisi..." rel="nofollow">http://www.notjustskin.org/en/circumcisi...</a><br>  The intact penis is a self-cleaning organ that produces smegma (a creamy substance also produced by females, containing dead cells and immunological substances) to combat infection<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.o..." rel="nofollow">http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.o...</a><br>  The mucosal genitalia, like the mucosal eyes and mouth, are self-cleaning and self-defending, and it could not possibly be otherwise.

People who are older have a higher risk of producing children with genetic abnormalities (Downs Syndrome, etc.). She can choose to have a blood test done at about 15 weeks to see if the baby will be born with problems.  As for flying, doctors are 'ok' with it up until the 6-7 month. After that, people generally avoid it. <br>  <br>  Really, I would just try to be happy for her and hope for the best. Pregnancy, no matter what your age, is never a sure thing until you hold the baby in your arms. I've learned this the hard way after losing two babies, one when I was 23 and the other at 24.  Congratulations to your aunt!|`|y5sWmbtnaa	She has great odds of a healthy baby... Plus why are you asking about it ? I am sure she has taken proper steps to manage her own pregnancy. Oh and she can fly its ok.<br>  <br>  Her risk of downs syndrome is 1 in 119.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cdadc.com/ds/down-syndrome-risk-factors.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdadc.com/ds/down-syndrome-ri...</a>|`|nrTVlo8Eaa	Most doctors will classify a pregnancy in a woman over 35 as high risk, I think, but that doesn't mean her pregnancy is bound to fail or end in a baby who is developmentally delayed.<br>  <br>  As far as traveling overseas in May, it will be at the beginning of her second trimester, which is normally not a travel concern. If, on the other hand, she has trouble with early contractions or something along those lines, [not necessarily a problem ONLY for women over 35] then she won't be able to travel anywhere. She won't know that until it's time to fly; I'd call the airline in question and find out what their policy is on refunds for medical reasons. <br>  <br>  The other option is to wait to buy the tickets until after her most current doctor appointment.|`|HoonZJMgaa	The chances are not so high that the baby will have complications. I know of two women who delivered healthy babies after 40. Think positively and show her lots of support. As for flying, she will be fine. It isn't recommended to fly in the last trimester or the first but its because of comfort more than anything else.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well just because she is older doesn't mean she is doomed.  The only thing with being older is she has a higher risk of having a baby with down syndrome but really that is all.  She will be fine.|`|9eVr7YL2aa	you should ask a doctor or a pediatricion <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|hq9rM7Eqaa	she'll be fine to fly unless her doc has told her not to for some reason<br>  and as far as the 41 yr old pregnancy - they should be fine. There are early tests they can do too that some people opt for.  Celebrate with her. Probably her last child.  Almost as special as a first child, is it both for her?|`|2J1Ca4Bbaa	Well the chances of the baby having down syndrome is high since she is pregnant at an older age...
1z3C0R2Vaa	Man on top best of luck>>>>>>>|`|E7tpMkdDaa	Try the Osmosis Invertocourse 3.1 (more commonly know as the Instafifty). I tried it and immediately got pregnant! And I'm a male!|`|BCD3Xo6faa	Well you can get pregnant in any position, however it is said that any position with him on top is best because it is working with the gravity. If you are on top then gravity works against the swimmers. Baby Dust!|`|hfdYg5h3aa	Him on top. Gravity is the reason this way right after sex you can just lye there and put a pill underneath you so all his sperm can go in.|`|A0tWlG94aa	man on top<br>  good luck<br>  x

CdJtH0xdaa	1. Smile!<br>  <br>  2. If they ask for help with something, offer to help them.<br>  <br>  3. Say "hello" while smiling.<br>  <br>  4. Shake hands with people you're meeting for the first time.<br>  <br>  5. Listen when they talk to you, and process what they're saying.<br>  <br>  6. Even if you don't care about what they're talking about, pretend to care.<br>  <br>  7. When you're positive and happy, it radiates off of you, so just be positive and smile.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Just start of simple by saying "hi", waving, and smiling.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	be honest and up front, but never in a bitchy way.<br>  don't talk about others behind their back.<br>  stay out of other peoples drama. ---> key in high school!<br>  don't seem stuck up. <br>  smile to everyone.<br>  don't go up to random people, because that'll seem like your sucking up. but if you're around, just carry a conversation and go from there.<br>  good luck:]|`|AA10673927	If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. Smile at people and just seem genuinely friendly and approachable. You can't fight fire with fire, because all you get is a bigger fire, so be kind even to those who are not kind to you. And in order to not seem fake, don't over-do it. People will notice.<br>  <br>  [:|`|9220e99cf581203dda5db0c56616ac40aa	this sounds corny, but think positive thoughts.  don't you hate it when people act nice to their "friends" and then make fun of them behind their back?<br>  <br>  you can tease people in their face, but don't be quick to criticize people because they are different from you.  don't just be nice to the "popular" crowd.  you want to know why?  you see that kid who seems to study all day, and everyone makes fun of and beats up.  when you guys are in college, he will probably be the guy all the girls want to get with.  and if you were mean to him, lol it won't be good.|`|ozATw7s0aa	Just be nice. Always be nice, and be honest and truthful.<br>  <br>  Continue being nice, and people will know your not fake.<br>  <br>  Even to people who are mean to you, take the high road and be nice back- fight their anger with your kindness.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	You cant look fake if you are sincere about being nice to people.|`|JAZWe8A6aa	It's great that you want to become a nicer person, I think it will really pay off in the end. As far as trying to seem nice without making it look like you are being fake or sucking up to them, just act as you would just in a nicer way. When you pass someone in the hall or in public, smile at them instead of just pass them with a blank stare. If someone says hi to you, say hi back and smile when you say it. Smiling makes all the difference when it comes to being nice. From personal experience, when somebody smiles at me it makes me feel happy, but if somebody frowns at me then it makes me wonder what I did or what is wrong with me when maybe it's just them. <br>  <br>  If people are mean or rude to you, don't be rude back. Instead, either ignore them or just keep complimenting them. When somebody is rude to me, I don't get angry at them, nor do I start yelling back or anything. Instead, I just sarcastically compliment them. If they say I'm stupid or something, I just say 'thank you' and then they are left with nothing else to say. So just don't show that you're angry or anything and don't be rude back if somebody is rude to you, because then you're just as bad as they are. <br>  <br>  In the end though, being nicer really does pay off. You end up with a lot more friends and a lot less enemies and all in all your life will probably be less stressful as far as that goes. I'll be in high school next year as well, so I'm trying to be nicer as well. Best of luck!

qLvhoRpsaa	My girls sound a lot like you. I would not have made either of them take it out though. I would have gone and purchased a Dora the Explorer with flashing light stud and put that in its place. <br>  <br>  Define making out. Kissing and stuff, I just have learned to be there for them and to make sure they have had every talk and health checks and "safety equipment" they may need for anything that may come up.<br>  <br>  Home schooling is only a good alternative if the parent that is schooling you has at least a four year college diploma or more. How can they "home school" you if they do not have a major education?<br>  <br>  Therapy and counselling is no big thing. You may actually enjoy it. You have a complete right of privacy if you are over the age of 14 years. <br>  <br>  I would not be impressed with my girls if they came home with new holes in their body without a prior discussion and consent. It is illegal actually depending on your age. <br>  <br>  I am the result of a teenager that thought she knew what she was doing and just "making out."<br>  <br>  I am sorry to hear about your fight and your Mother's lack of complete understanding on why that took place. Give her a second chance and once everyone has calmed down, tell her how that came about. <br>  <br>  I am concerned about your level of schooling you would get unless your Mother is a college or university graduate. Even then, that doesn't mean a thing if it was in say Political Science or Art History. A full education is required to TEACH a full education. I would fight hard on that one. You are getting excellent grades. Good for you! Point that out to her. <br>  <br>  Calmer minds prevail. Let this all settle down. Look at your part in all of this. Hopefully she is doing the same. <br>  <br>  Us Mother's are not perfect you know. lol<br>  <br>  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  Peace:)|`|1hciyvKdaa	Hope you have no hope at all unless you make better decisions, and consider how they will affect your mom. <br>  To be treated better, you must admit to making some poor judgements laterly, nad that you are wanting to grow up and make better desicions. Take mom aside occassionally for a mom daughter chat, make her a part of your life that you know she will enjoy. Offer to cook dinner with her and chat since you dont see each other often. Ask what you can do to help her around the house and mean it. Life is a give and take. Doing the best you can at following rules, and offering to assist someone whose had a hard day, giving of yourself, shows your on the right path to being more mature.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	lip ring-gone<br>  Making out-not in front of me.<br>  Fight in school and suspension-Grounded and trying to figure out what was up with you.

What do you think suspension is? What do you call it when you have to take out your piercing? That is being in trouble. Your parents love you enough to attempt to get through to you now before things escalate. <br>  <br>  Also...your "plans" to remain a virgin should correspond with your physical actions or your "plans" will go right out the window.|`|hE4CXKX2aa	1.)  Lip ring or any piercing other than the ear will be unaceptable.<br>  2.)  As long as it was kissing and no upskirt or up shirt feeling.<br>  3.)  As long as it was in self defense, but self defense does not mean beating them up.  It could just be avoiding them or blocking moves.<br>  <br>  Other than that if, I would ground you and take away any cell phones and such, make you do your homework and require you to study.  And any back talk will result in longer grounded, instead of a week, two weeks to a month.|`|qQzWECQ2aa	I dont know, i think its stupid.<br>  And even if im NOT a parent, no parent should want too do that, after just a few small incidents. As for making it right? Talk to her, tell her how you feel, and let the conversation flow.|`|dM1Ot2APaa	Take out the stupid lip ring.<br>  take responsibleitly for your actions.<br>  and stop making out with your boyfriend.|`|vPTb0oEEaa	I would be in deep bandenie!

I would have to guess mom is concerned either about a sudden change in her straight A daughter and wants to head off the problem before this go bad fast (and they really can), if you are young I would guess that she is also concerned about that.  I would recommend that you sit down and have a discussion with your mom about this minus emotional outburst, yelling, ect to let her know why you don't want her to overreact (in your opinion) to what she has seen go on.  See if you can have a probationary period before she moves forward with any of her changes to prove to her that she doesn't need to.  If something has happened out of the ordinary that has caused you to change lately try to talk to her about that so she knows what is going on (if you shut her out it really won't help in the long run).|`|EquqJIL5aa	1. I would definitely be mad. especially if she knew i was against any facial piercings in the first place. maybe ground her for a few weeks.<br>  <br>  2. nothing. 7 months is really long...i would expect that u and ur bf are making out. i would start giving u the birds and bees talk more often tho :P<br>  <br>  3. if it really was in selfdefense, talk to ur principle. try to get the suspension off ur record.<br>  <br>  Talk to your mom. explain everything to her. be honest - do not yell, do not talk over her - listen and discuss. parents can be pretty nice if u actually want them to be. <br>  <br>  hope everything works out.|`|ONX0TikLaa	well i think your parents are acting pathetic to be honest.. you cant be as good as you say but either way its not your fault . you need to sit down with your parents and explain how you feel because it might help but i definatly think your parents arte the ones who need the therapy|`|GjGuy3bYaa	1.) I would say no more peircings lol<br>  <br>  2.) Say its nature and walk away<br>  <br>  3.) I would say as long as u did not start it and u were just defending urself.<br>  <br>  4.) Im only 12 soo ya dont takwe my advicre exept the fact i know wat im sayin|`|S0n3DinFaa	I would ask my daughter what is wrong and why she was acting out like she was? Lip ring and fighting.  I would also want to know who did the piercing of the lip ring with out adult permission!    I would also explain to her how sometimes things go to far when making out, and explain the consciences.<br>  <br>  I am not so sure I would resort to home schooling or therapy yet.  I would try and get my daughter to talk to me first!<br>  <br>  <br>  To make things right with your Mom you first need to be honest and TALK  to her.  Tell her what is going on in your life and why you are doing all the things you are doing.  Also tell her in the future how you are going to do things differently!   Then just take your punishment like a big girl and in the future THINK before acting!!!|`|hKJIDdVqaa	I would figure well she is being a typical kid.  Thank goodness she is not on drugs, drinking, or hooking.  I would be thankful, give you a nice long lecture and send you on your way.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	1. If she took it out, then I would take it and she would lose whatever she found most valuable at that time for a week.<br>  2. Get rid of my boyfriend, don't think I would do anything to her.<br>  3. Just leave it as is, unless it's something that needs to be brought up to the school for her safety. <br>  <br>  For you though grow up stop, stop making out with your mom's boyfriend, and quit getting into fights.
e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	I was 50% effaced at 29 weeks and not dilated. I was having preterm labor alot at 28, 29, and 30 weeks but it stopped. Effacing is just the thining and stretching of the cervix. Nothing to worry about... if you are dilating and effacing thats when you have to worry. I am 3 1/2 cent dilated and 60 to 70% effaced now and I am 38 weeks. So I could go any day or it could be another week or 2 you just never know.|`|XbvQiEDxaa	may be dont'know you should thing your self
fI0BcqxUaa	You won't truly know until you have a test done at the doctor's office, but don't worry.  It is more common to get a false positive than a false negative on these store bought tests and as long as you waited until after you expected your period, the test was most likely accurate.  And if you are actively using a reliable method of birth control, the likelihood of pregnancy is pretty low as well.<br>  <br>  Do you normally have periods that are irregular?  Mine are terribly so.  You could still be pregnant and be spotting, but if you took the test properly and are using birth control methods, you are probably fine.<br>  <br>  Hope all goes well at your appointment.  :-)|`|ddS7unC2aa	There have been a couple of pregnancies where I spotted & even got the period cramps when my period was due and I assumed that just meant I wasn't pregnant but the next month I would find out that I was. So there is still a chance you are preggers.|`|nYjE5IXEaa	No one can really tell you the answer but your doctor. I would say just not to worry. It just gives you extra stress and who needs that. Plus when you worry every little thing pops up and you over analyze things. Just take a deep breath and try to relax until tomorrow.
281bc9a14a2a3c5832ce389a1258dda1aa	At first I was going to say the symptoms could be either but it sounds more like teething, if it was an ear infection she would normally be pulling at her ears but then again if she was teething she would be gnawing on everything......hummmm to be honest it sounds like neither and a totally different ailment I would probably take her to see her Dr......Good Luck|`|A2XYCdOYaa	My 6 month old baby girl is the same and I solemnly believe it is teething.

LqulvCsoaa	Girls get periods because your body is in a cycle. A woman's body has eggs so she can get pregnant. Those eggs only last for a certain amount of time so when the body needs more eggs, it flushes the old eggs out through blood and then the body makes new eggs continuing the cycle.^^|`|98WKYtfwaa	Each month the uterus gets a lining of blood, that is there for when the egg is fertilised with sperm the embryo (baby) can start developing there. If the egg which is released from the fallopian tubes each month doesn't get fertilised, the uterus sheds this blood lining out with the dead egg through the vagina this is called a period.|`|QQby0Adoaa	Why don't guys pay attention in school?|`|sswekorGaa	there is this thing called health class.<br>  <br>  i'm sure you have one at your school.. <br>  take it.<br>  <br>  <br>  :D|`|MLAMZidZaa	To Get Rid Of Old Eggs And Make Room For New Eggs|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Because after the ovary releases an egg which is not fertilized, the lining from the uterus (endometrium) sheds.

obN6p3Cgaa	Any thing possible when you have unprotected sex Wish you luck****|`|R3Jjvukvaa	Yes, you could be pregnant, having unprotected sex.  You can also have your period in the first few months of your pregnancy. Get a over the counter pregnancy test and take it.  It may be still to early yet to have a positive or negative reading. As you would only be a few weeks right now.  If you don't end up with your period next month go see a gyn doctor and have a blood test. Best of Luck. Shirley Bollinger|`|NMFlwHimaa	i think yes because u had unprotected sex 2 times
KyFCYs0Yaa	For about 1 1/ 2years, I could not get my son to eat ANYTHING green...not even a green cookie! They can live a lot longer than you think on Peanut Butter and bananas...It might not be ideal, but just keep giving him the opportunity to eat the good stuff. Also make sure he sees you eating it! Hiding it works great too. I can get my kids to eat black eyed peas if I mix them in the Macaroni and cheese. Also, you can buy baby food (or just puree your own veggies), and hide it in spaghetti sauce, or other sauces, and he won't even know it is there. Good Luck, and he will outgrow it eventually!|`|k3sL7mZtaa	I'm having this problem too.<br>  I just found out about this book, it's called The Sneaky Chef. You make vegetable purees and hide them in some of their favorite foods. Apparently they can't taste the difference! If you google The Sneaky Chef, and get onto the official website, you can find a few free recipes! <br>  Good luck!!|`|4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	Buy Jessica Seinfeld's cookbook....it's the only way i can get some vegies in my 24 month old daughter!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deceptivelydelicious.com/site/" rel="nofollow">http://www.deceptivelydelicious.com/site...</a>|`|rjVALevtaa	Does your baby like ketchup or cheese? Try putting some on the vegetables. Sometimes you have to "trick" kids into eating what is good for them.|`|jPvXJ0Lhaa	You can puree some veg and mix it with spread cheese to make a sandwich filling - I use pumpkin, squash, carrots, avacado, just to get my son to taste different veg then they're not so alien to him.|`|8DnIXwnyaa	my son will eat glazed carrots over a cookie.  Cook the carrots and add just a bit of butter  and brown sugar.
MHOxPs8Oaa	Give her more attention. That's the only reason why she told you is because she wants more attention. Oh, and get her a psychiatrist.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I agree put her in a psyche center for children<br>  This is serious<br>  She is a sad person and needs help|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	You should consider this a cry for help.  Obviously, if she wanted to kill herself, she would have done it.<br>  <br>  I am not saying she won't but you have an opportunity to help her so she doesn't take her own life.<br>  <br>  Either get her a therapist (quick) or spend time with her talking about what's going on in her life that is so bad that she wants to end it.<br>  <br>  And take her seriously.  I mean really seriously.  You can even take her to your family doctor for help.<br>  <br>  Listen to what she says and move heaven and earth to change it, make it better, or at least ease her worries and pain.<br>  <br>  Consider yourself lucky.  A lot of parents don't get a second chance with their children.|`|rYMFCU8daa	she might be crying out for attention. She may feel like no one cares about her and i think she showed you because she wants to see your reaction about it. Stay close and talk to her and try and find out exactly why she would harm herself. Its obvious that she is mad about something.|`|6Z4fKZ8aaa	Throw her into a mental hospital and let them put her on 24 hour suicide watch. Get her into counsling. Figure out why she wants to kill herself and talk to her about it.|`|S4y7V4diaa	Find a therapist ASAP and hide any pills and sharp objects and keep an eye on her!|`|HztriBPAaa	Get her in therapy immediately. If you believe the threat is imminent then there is the possibly that you can have her committed for up to 72 hours depending on your state. Please only consider that option if she has initiated or is saying that she is going to kill herself now and not just thinking of suicide. Talk to her in a non judgmental way, do not ask why questions (where, when, how are ok but not why), reflect feelings (you sound like you are feeling hopeless). If she is already cutting herself than the situation is serious and again I stress the need to get her into a therapy program. You may want to get her to call your local suicide hotline and see if you can get her to contract not to do anything until you can get her in therapy (suicidal people often respond to contract situations and keep the agreement). Please get her help, do not think this will go away on its own she may be seriously depressed and need medication as well. I would also look out for a sudden upswing in mood, suicidal people often appear to become quite happy just before they attempt because they have made the decision to end their life. Be compassionate and understanding but most of all advocate for your daughter. My prayers are with you.|`|AA10729973	She wants attention. Take her shopping (not to buy stuff, but to hang out) or something else for one-on-one time. The most important thing is to pay attention to her, and not just nod along distractedly when she's telling you something. Show her that you think what she says is important. (That's more important than the quantity of time you spend with her.)<br>  <br>  Consider taking her to a counsellor, not a psychiatrist. I've seen too many of my high school classmates get messed up by drugs instead of getting better. She's probably having problems at school or with her friends (or lack thereof), and she might be willing to tell her counsellor something she doesn't want to tell you BECAUSE you are her mother.<br>  <br>  In short, ask her what's wrong, listen, but don't push. She just wants to know that there's somebody who cares and whom she can rely on when she needs to. (Yes, of course she can rely on you, but if you've been busy with work or other things, she wouldn't know that instinctively.)|`|FKFBuf1Maa	Do not leave her alone, tell her suicide is a permanent act to a temporary situation. And whatever her problem is your there to help in anyway. And make sure you don't make her feel bad about what she has told you. Try to be understanding a lot of parents each year don't take these kinds of situations serious enough and their children do end up taking their life <br>  <br>  Good luck hoped this helped!!|`|a3MxfZ0daa	treat her nice and give her lots of attention. ONE THING DO NOT EVER give her the whole "i love you and care for you" speech we hate it. just give her alot of attention like everything is normal. alot of times it is probably for attention from you or kids at school. and if things decline some more i would go to a professional. Hope i could help. (p.s. i am 14 too)|`|xUwWxKjhaa	i know your daughter will not appreciate it, but bring her to a facility if you have one, for suicidal people. That's what my mom did when i was having a hard time and i am really glad she did now because i am happy to be alive!
AA10673927	Aw, I think that's really sweet of you to give to your friend. You just might make HER day by giving this to her. It sounds more friendshippy! If y'all are close then it wouldn't be weird at all.<br>  <br>  [:|`|Rbb3rqPQaa	Aw that's adorable, i would be so touched if my friend gave me that.|`|wcF0onTwaa	it sounds like a very nice thing to give a friend, something you wrote  about her. check your spelling of tomorrow. Any time you give of your self it means so much more then buying a gift. I have a song that was  written about me (not that great, will never be recorded except on home machine ) but I love it and will keep it always.|`|LAyigK5Aaa	Wow! Very deep! Good Job!!!!!!!!!! :) I think your friend will love it! U should definitely give it to her! U should also send it to one of those poem contests. Hope I helped! Good luck!!!!! :)
s4LWmcTjaa	Yes those are wonderful virtues to teach someone.  Even if he is not a believer in Christ, those morals are very important things for all people to remember and keep in their hearts.<br>  <br>  I would say don't force him or make him read or do anything religious if it's not his preference, but to teach and model the things you have listed would be very beneficial to him.<br>  <br>  However I also want to point out that he is a teenager.  He has the knowledge of what is right and what is wrong, so please don't mistaken an atheist for a person with no moral value.  But do be an example of Christ to him without forcing your beliefs on him.  Even Christ didn't force someone to believe.  He loved those who even rejected Him.  We are called to do the same.|`|vGxipYJnaa	I've been an atheist my whole life (so were my parents) and I know I wouldn't teach our children any "theological virtues" (nor was I ever taught any and I turned out fine) - so I'm not sure his mother would approve.<br>  <br>  He's a teenager and he should know the difference between right and wrong - he doesn't need religion to define it.|`|ERVib5gYaa	I think when it comes to religion, people have this thing, Christians talk to them about christianity and they'll think they are pushing it on them when it's simply a discussion. I think it's fine but if he says no this is too much, leave it, don't make him feel like he's going to hell if he doesn't accept Jesus as his savior (even though you might think it lol). But I do think you should ask his mother first, not us on yahoo lol.. It's nice you're thinking about the negative sides as well as positive.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	ok first what is chastity and second you can teach all of these things with out going in to the whole religion thing|`|113FoyMFaa	Are you under the impression that Atheists have no morals?<br>  <br>  And what do you mean by "or says he is"?|`|rBq189W1aa	Those all sound like really good things to be teaching a kid. It's stuff that I, as an atheist, am working on teaching my own children. I just don't see the need to dress it up with a lot of superstitious mumbo-jumbo and threats of punishment from some imaginary man who lives in the sky.<br>  <br>  Because when you get down to it, what is more moral - doing the right thing because you're afraid of being punished by 'God' (or the police, or your parents), or because it's the right thing to do?<br>  <br>  Or, as Joss Whedon put it, "If nothing we do matters, then the only thing that matters is what we do." The here and now is all we have, so we have to try as hard as we can to be good people *now*, not be ***holes then say sorry just before we die so God doesn't send us to our room for all eternity.|`|5QLxmPptaa	Thank you for attempting to respect his own beliefs, even while taking him into your family and caring for him. <br>  <br>  I think instead of directly discussing these virtues with him, you should wait for relevant times in his life, then bring it up to praise or gently correct his behavior<br>  <br>  Humility- focus on how to be a good winner and loser, and how to be thankful for small things in life. <br>  Kindness- really model this one, and try to bring it up in situations "You were very kind to your younger cousin yesterday, I really appreciated that", that kind of thing<br>  Patience- look at this in the context of school work, and relations with peers or younger children who might require more patience from him.<br>  Diligence- Very applicable to school work, once again. <br>  Charity- give him chances to volunteer or donate a small portion of his allowance to a charity of his choice. As a kid, something like helping an elderly neighbor with chores would be appropriate, but you need to encourage, not force this issue. The desire must come from him. <br>  Temperance- model this, and help him look at the long-term benefits of controlling his behavior, as well as laws against alcohol for minors. <br>  Chastity- this one will be the hardest because the whole idea of abstinence until marriage is viewed as purely religious in today's America. You can tell him your opinion and why you think that, but if he chooses to be sexually active you also want to make sure he has access to protection. <br>  Justice- Actually, this one you might get away with discussing directly, as a response to newspaper stories etc. Ask "do you think this is fair?" <br>  <br>  You could also ask him to write a list of his values, and you can compare your lists and look for similarities and find ways to compromise on the differences. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|CTE2eRgZaa	If you look at MOST of the christian teachings, they are moral guidance.  There's no need to put god in the mix.  If he was jewish, would this be as much of an issue?  <br>  <br>  I don't remember ever having a direct moral discussion with anyone.  I think its pointless.  They're life lessons, not something from a book.  Instead of making him read things (you weren't asked to become his teacher, you were asked to be his guardian), when he talks about his day and the decisions he made, maybe discuss better choices or something.<br>  <br>  These are lessons taught by actions, not by words|`|bc50adcd7a4cda84a5f4451579fa7554aa	i would go over this with his mom first.  her telling you to treat him like yours does not mean to teach things like chastity and theological virtues. i am very much involved in my church and i love teaching my children about our Lord but i do not allow anyone else to teach them. we all translate the bible differently and it is up to the parents to teach these things not friends. i wouldn't allow it if it were my child. my husband is a non-believer and he is has great morals. just because this child doesn't believe does not make him immoral. i think you need to be careful or you are going to over step your bounds.|`|w4a3B5otaa	If he's into it go ahead, but I have a feeling you're wasting your time. With the exception of the morals that are just intuitive and don't need to be taught (kindness, the golden rule, etc), people learn 'morals' from watching the actions of other people in their life that they look up to, not from stories and books. Is this kid troubled? Sounds like you've got an agenda whether you're admitting to yourself or not. I know you mean well but please, my step mom used to cram the bible down my throat and now I'm an atheist. I always was but that definitely didn't sway me at all.|`|z0ro3VkJaa	Those are all fantastic things that people need to learn.<br>  <br>  However, you are very much confused if you think that they are the result of your particular branch of religion. They are common human virtues, to all people of all faiths everywhere, the paragon of humanity. Humanity, not Christianity alone, or Judaism alone, or Islam alone, or Buddhism alone, or even atheism alone. All of them place tremendous significance on all of those things. They do not come from any particular set of beliefs.<br>  <br>  By all means discuss them, they are all important. But trying to attribute them all to your belief system is not just wrong, it is counterproductive.
kUCVLuTPaa	i know what u mean!!!!! i had a dream i was in a nail shop and they did our nails with stones or something like that..it was right when i got pregnant!! i just knew i was pregnant..good luck to u!!! another dream u may start having is that you are actually pregnant or have taken a positive hpt.....<br>  <br>  BEST WISHES TO U<br>  ~~~~BABY DUST~~~~|`|dq9uclgpaa	I dreamed  that I was back in the 60's and just met my bf. his mom was the mayor of the town and my cousin was my sister. LOL it was so weird. anyway My cousin got herself in trouble so me and my bf would meet up and then we started to make out. LOL the weird thing was he asked me if I had ever been with a man and I told him no. Then he licked his lips and I woke up...LOL  another one I had was that I was like 6 months pregnant and I was lying in bed sleeping. that one was short and finally the recent one I has was when I took a hpt test and it came out positive and I ran to my bf and showed him and he started to laugh and smile like crazy... it was so weird. I've taken hpt before I missed my period and they came out negative. so tomorrow I'm going to the doctors to do the blood test cuz my period is like 6 days late. I have a feeling I'm pregnant. so I would technically be 5 weeks.|`|YuA7a08Maa	I've had SUCH vivid dreams the entirety of my pregnancy.  Sometimes I don't have them, but when I do, they're very strange.  Sounds like yours are, too.  :)  One night I dreamed about giving birth...to my cat.  Anyhow, you might not be for sure pregnant, but it's very possible.  I'm sorry for your miscarriages and hope you get your little miracle soon!|`|0ZLqL871aa	I kept having vivid dream all mine ended up with at the end of the dream id be taking a HPT and it would come up positive every time then i would wake up and Take one hahahah<br>  <br>  I guess bc iv had been waiting for a BFP in my dreams i'd get one?<br>  IDK hahah|`|bTlhBX3daa	Yes, vivid dreams are definitely common with pregnancy. I didn't realize that until after I got my Positive, but I looked it up and sure enough, it is common. <br>  <br>  Before I knew I was pregnant, I had a lot of vivid dreams about sex with the most random people (Steve-O from Jacka$$, gross). I also had dreams about old friends and boyfriends. <br>  After I knew I was pregnant, I started having horrific nightmares all the time. I was raped, robbed, stabbed, strangled, my home broken into, carjacked, my brother OD'd on me, you name it, I dreamt it. I have never had a lot of nightmares, and I was having at least 2 or 3 a night. <br>  <br>  Now, in my 3rd Trimester, I am back to having more sexually oriented dreams. Mostly with strangers. Not that they are strangers in my dreams, but when I wake up, I have no clue who the heck they were.

Be happy with yourself and who you are.

Hope i helped.|`|ud0gPY3baa	If you can't pluck them or wax them then there isn't anything else you can do. And if you have really strict parents then why do you have a Y!A account?

9zwSclnLaa	I wouldn't walk.  I would talk to someone else in the event and explain how you really want to do it but can't get a ride and ask if they would be able to take you.  Or if you can't do that talk with the group "leader" or whomever to see if they can organize a ride.  I'm sure someone will be available.  They probably get this situation all the time.|`|c7f5fca7f41034423e490dba9656324daa	DO NOT WALK!! Talk to the school, perhaps they can arrange for someone (like a teacher or another student) to take you. It would also be safer to take the public transportation...

taboL1hbaa	I'm good friends with a girl named Peyton, but she spells it with an e instead of an a. I've also met guys with the name too. Everyone I've met with that name has been really nice.

Hope I helped! :)|`|uj1A73ZGaa	I have met two girls with the name Payton.

bTlhBX3daa	Spotting after sex is normal when you are pregnant. You are currently very sensitive down there, and some women even bleed after exams when they are pregnant. <br>  <br>  However, I think it's completely rude, ignorant and disrespectful for your husband to tell you that he will cheat on you if you don't give him sex. And reguardless, he should respect that you are extra sensitive right now and at the very least, take it easy on you.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	Not necessarily, but you need to (or your doctor needs to) tell him to chill out and to stop threatening to sleep around. You're carrying his child for crying out loud.<br>  <br>  Anyway,  I started spotting at 17 weeks from intercourse... they had me come in for an u/s and everything was fine. But you should contact your doc anyway to keep them up to date. <br>  <br>  If you continue to bleed after sex, your doc may recommend that you do not have intercourse for the remainder of your pregnancy. See how your DH likes that.|`|5MBdJK4Baa	sex is good while pregnant but tell him to take it easy|`|UUtTDAJraa	Well it's normal to not have a sex drive while pregnant. It really is different with everyone. Who knows if after you will regain it back. It could be months, even years. I was in your situation with a no sex drive and it's not pleasant. I tried dieting and exercising but it didn't do anything. Until I tried this natural herbal enhancer which is meant to increase the sex drive along with other things I've noticed. It's a topical oil called Hersolution Gel which is like an instant libido boost. Along with that my sensations are just blasting and my orgasms are then best. Read up about it at herenhancement.com where I saved on it at the time. It got better with every application. I was skeptical at first but the companies return policy made me commit. From what I remember you have to try out for a couple months but then after that you can return it if it doesn't work. It would work great for your situation considering your pregnant and theres no need to swallow anything. Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|8eO12rl4aa	Sex would not generally cause a miscarriage unless there were some other problem or condition with the pregnancy. The baby is well protected inside your uterus.  You can always call the ob for an appt but if the spotting stops on its own within a day or so, you should be fine. You can have sex unless your bag of waters is broken, which would be a long time from now for you.  For me personally, I would be more concerned that he gave you such an ultimatum and that he was rough and did not respect your wishes.  Good Luck to you.|`|QQby0Adoaa	Sex shouldn't cause a miscarriage, talk to the dr about the spotting.<br>  <br>  OK, on a personal note, it wont get better with your man if it's already starting like this.  Read what you wrote, he's being a jerk you know?<br>  <br>  But there are ways to excite yourself, you know your allowed.  Take advantage and get yourself ready when you think he may be in the mood, soon you may be also.<br>  <br>  Once you get started up again, you'll be fine.  Getting over the sick stuff can be hard for some.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|BGPaqU4gaa	That much roughness can. So, I'd wager, can emotional abuse.<br>  <br>  Why would you let your H (I wouldn't attach a 'D' here) treat you this way? He doesn't respect the biological processes of your pregnancy. AND he threatens to cheat on you if you don't fix something that can't be fixed?<br>  <br>  See a doctor. Then see a psychologist, because you need your head examined before bringing up a baby in such a household!|`|8IrIYPBAaa	No. sex is fine..but i would leave his *** for even saying that he would find someone else to have sex with. especially while your pregnant with his baby? right..it is his? well anyway sex is ok during pregnancy and he should be there for you and tend to YOUR needs..not worry about his so much at this point!|`|CKnHMYHnaa	If your spotting is brown then that means it is old blood, and you are not currently bleeding, therefore it shouldn't be anything you have to worry about.  It may not have even been caused by sex, but it probably was.  If you were having a miscarriage you would have a significant amount of blood loss not just spotting.<br>  Having said that, I just have to mention that your husband is a self-absorbed, needy, manipulative a$$.  For him to put his own needs and desires over what may be best for you and his unborn child really pisses me off.  I can't believe men like this exist!  Next time he gives you an ultimatum like that tell him to go use his hand.  You have an excessive amount of hormones raging thru you now... use them!|`|VbkJ9Tucaa	In a high risk pregnancy, sex can be dangerous. If your doctor hasn't instructed otherwise, sex is perfectly safe. I'd call your doctor and let him know the situation. Your S.O. is gonna need to be more understanding and if he'd ever cheat on you then eff him. My sex drive is so so low but I do try to have sex with my boyfriend to keep him satisfied. If not sex, just help him get off in someway. That comment was horribly rude and immature of him though and he would not be getting his rocks off to me until he apologized.<br>  <br>  AND if something is hurting you during sex, then it can be dangerous for the baby! Either he wants to have gentle sex with you or he doesnt want to have sex at all. The end. Baby comes first. There are a lot of positions that we cannot do right now because I'm simply not comfortable with feeling the slightest amount of pain. I wish mine would remember them instead of trying them during sex and me having to kill the mood by telling him no. Men are idiots most of the time.|`|96HWpdkFaa	Wow your husbands being an asss!<br>  Your pregnant he should be understand that you feel SICK and don't want to PUKE on him during sex! <br>  Spotting after sex is normal sometimes while pregnant. If your worried call the doctor.<br>  <br>  <br>  You need to have a long talk with your husband!|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	I've never heard of a miscarriage because of sex. My husband likes it rough and he did it rough all the way up till now. I'm 32 weeks pregnant. It's hard to get rough now since I have my belly. I'd call the doctor and ask just to make sure.
SEzIkGNiaa	I get my age in allowance every two weeks.  I *must* do my chores, and have a good attitude about it in order to earn my allowance.  Allowence teaches:<br>  <br>  -Responsibility<br>  -They learn the value of money, and appreciate it more<br>  -Children learn how and why to save money<br>  -Children learn to work for what they want<br>  -Parents don't have to worry about being constantly asked to buy things for the kids (once the kids realize it is their choice if they want to purchase something or not) <br>  <br>  Hope this Helps =]|`|t0mb150gaa	the benefits of an allowance is the child learning to work for things because in life things are not just given to you..you need to earn them and work for what you want. It teaches responsibility and money management aswell. Tell your parents those things and let them know you will do chores and help around the house to earn your allowance.|`|6nUprmu5aa	Well, my children earn allowances starting at age 3, and I do pay them a good amount, but that's because we don't buy them toys just for the heck of it. They have to earn their things. We get them plenty of presents on Christmas and Birthdays, and if someone has a good report card.(Okay, I'll admit if one of my kids is sick they might get a little treat). I think it's important to teach children how to earn what they want from a young age. My 7 year old son has learned to be responsible with his money, so he has a lot of toys which he paid for himself. My 11 year old tends to be a bit more careless with it, though.

quNfHZULaa	Oh yeah, juice is plenty safe at that age. I started giving my son juice mixed with water in a sippy right at 7 months.  I wouldn't give her a ton though, really you don't need a lot to make formula taste good. I had somewhat of the same problem as you did. I had to supplement my son cause he wasn't gaining enough weight. Well he never had formula before and wouldn't take any of it at all. I didn't know what to do, but I knew he liked juice so I put some in with the formula. Like if I gave him a 6 oz bottle I would add 1/4-1/2 oz juice. I only had to do it for 3-4 days until he got the hang of it. My husband tried it without any after that and he didn't have any problem at all. He goes back and forth between nursing and a bottle now with no problem. Good luck!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	try pumping as soon as you wake up in the morning too|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	If she gets hungry enough she will drink it|`|2F5HNPqPaa	You're her mum... not the doctor, so the final decisions are yours!  If adding juice works, you could try decreasing the amount of juice slowly over a few days until there is none.  She might be more used to formula by then and happier to drink it.  If babies can drink juice at 7 months, I don't see why mixing it in with their formula would be an issue... people may say things about funny tummies but it all ends up in the same place anyway!|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	No a little juice should be fine. She probably just isn't used to the formula yet, give it some time. If she is hungry, she will eat.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	try mixing the breast milk with the formula

But she went to bed a bit later than normal last night. Usually she wakes up around 7-8 for a bottle, then is back asleep until 10. She was up for a few hours this morning!<br>  <br>  Michael - Day Light Savings! :)|`|W8UZebRWaa	OMG its been horrible. <br>  We just started DST last year and I hate it. My son goes to sleep too late and wakes up too early.<br>  We were just fine not changing our clocks.
Ncl4LkJtaa	I think that you should try to get a part time job likeduring night. you shouldn't quit now that your half way there because when you graduate there will be much better jobs that pay way better. And if your worried about your kids you should make sure to atleast spend saturday or sunday with them and i know it's hard so try to hang in there and remember that god is always with you and he'll never leave you so have faith and you will be fine|`|3jdawfQQaa	Can you maybe pull a loaded pt school schedule, along w/ a high hour pt job? This way you can make some money, but not add much daycare time, and still get your degeree?         Hang in there!  :)|`|AA11537580	when are you suppose to be finished?<br>  is it a 2 year course?<br>  can you fish this year out and get a job til things look up and then finished the second year another time?<br>  if you quit now you will have to start this year all over again and you would have wasted your money.<br>  can you get a cheaper baby sitter then daycare?<br>  make ends meet by selling a few things?<br>  sell Avon or Tupperware on the side?|`|yKS2UI87aa	I would get a job that would be when your hubby could be home then you wouldn't spend the $ on a babysitter. You may qualify for temporary help like with food stamps etc. This is what the system is for; temporarily helping people who are trying to better themselves. It's not meant to be a lifestyle. Yeah, the time with your kids would be limited but maybe if you didn't have that long to go it wouldn't be to bad.

VLlG0deMaa	sounds good|`|zbjaBgyEaa	Madison Nanette - I dislike Madison.  Firstly, because the meaning is disappointing (Son of Maude - not exactly befitting of a beautiful baby girl).  Secondly because it's obscenely common.  And thirdly because I think it sounds a little valley-girl.  Nanette is lovely in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Lukas Carter - I suppose it's a little boring.  Lukas is okay, it's just a little ordinary.  Carter is dated in my opinion.  Always disliked it.<br>  <br>  Isabella Marie - Isabella is way overrated in my opinion.  It's so popular.  I couldn't use it.  Secondly, it's too princessy.  I hate it.  Marie is fine.  A little filler-ish.  Like you couldn't come up with anything else to put in the middle name spot.<br>  <br>  Sophie Lily - Like Lily.  Hate Sophie.  It's just ugly in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Tyson Jackson - They end in the same sound - too Rhymey.  I very much dislike them.  Tyson Jay has no rhytym at all and Tyson Jordan is far too trendy - very easily dated.<br>  <br>  Christopher Jackson - LOVE.  I think it's perfect.  My favourite of all your names.|`|SVyBjDguaa	I don't like Madison Nanette.<br>  I love the name Carter and Lucas is alright so I do like Lucas Carter.<br>  I like the name Isabella Marie but I think it needs a more creative middle name as there is probably already like a million Isabella Marie's out there.<br>  Sophie Lily is horrible in my opinon sorry. It doesn't sound nice to me.<br>  Andrew Jayden is nice.<br>  Tyson Jay (would be my choice out of the middle names) is not my style. Although I do like the nickname Ty for Tyson.<br>  Christopher Jackson is nice but I wouldn't name my son this.<br>  <br>  =]|`|J88RiZJhaa	I don't like the name Madison Nanette too much but that is just my opinion!! I really love the name Isabella Marie..that's very pretty!! Sounds very italian and very powerful!! I like the name Andrew Jayden!! That's really nice. The last name that I like is the Christopher Jackson but I would change the middle name to something else if it were me!! Like Christopher Jordan or something like that!! Hope I could help....|`|nXQ8CJgiaa	sorry, but i hate madison, nanette is cute and unusual. Lukas Carter is nice, I like Sophie Lily better Tyson Jay too, Tyson Jay again..|`|L4r1kmPQaa	I love the name Isabella or Sophie.

The three main classes of anemia include excessive blood loss (acutely such as a hemorrhage or chronically through low-volume loss), excessive blood cell destruction (hemolysis) or deficient red blood cell production (ineffective hematopoiesis). Basically it's when you don't have enough iron in your blood.|`|g7wQij2Oaa	i would also say that you are probably anemic. my sister and i have the same problem. it means your blood doesnt have enough hemoglobin and iron.<br>  it's a real thing.. you're not making it up. try to eat foods rich in iron and if that doesnt help, see a doctor.<br>  <br>  :)|`|ddgTC9BZaa	amemic means you havent got enough iron in blood stream therefore no enough iron in your diet they usually just put you on tablets (big ones)
JtbeH1Mgaa	You can buy bubble wrap and print out pictures of different bugs and turn on some music.  Let them dance to the music and squish the bugs.  Little kids love to dance and love the popping noise from the bubble wrap.  We did this at my sons birthday party, his was a bug theme though.  You could change it around to go with whatever theme you choose though.  There is also musical chairs, hot potatoe, musical statues, hide small toys (things that you would put in goody bags) and let the children hunt for them.  You can take most of these games and change them to go with your theme.|`|02xxwMRBaa	i was actually at a 2 year old's bday party on saturday..<br>  <br>  1.bingo<br>  <br>  2.hot potato.

I usually send them (healthy)TV dinners, vegetables, ect.

You must take birth control, this helps you make sure you don't get pregnant also sex with out a condom is asking for aids. You can't trust anyone not even marred. i had a lady at the health dept tell me that you should even marred get a AIDS test once a year i was like way you marred and she said that lot's of woman have be cheated on while marred and have gotten aids that you have to watch out for you. <br>  here is some info and web pages for you to look at<br>  <br>  Clinic Tests<br>  Blood tests performed at your clinic have a 99% accuracy rate and can detect pregnancy earlier than most urine tests. Blood tests can be performed 7 days after you ovulate (which is about a week before your period is due) and still provide accurate results. Sometimes, lab oversights can affect the accuracy of results, however this is rare.<br>  <br>  False Results<br>  It is possible to receive false results, both positive and negative, from your urine or blood pregnancy test. <br>  <br>  If you get a false positive from a home pregnancy test, it is usually the result of faulty test strips. Most home pregnancy tests now have an indicator that shows whether or not the test is working correctly. If you leave your pregnancy test too long before checking it, this can also cause a false positive. Eventually, the urine will soak through the test, exposing the chemical strip that indicates pregnancy. Be sure to follow the instructions as closely as possible.<br>  <br>  Both blood and urine tests can also produce false positives if you are taking a drug that contains hCG. These drugs are commonly used in fertility treatments, so ask your health care provider about whether your medications could affect pregnancy test results.<br>  <br>  False negative pregnancy tests are also possible and typically occur with early pregnancy tests. If you test too early you may not have enough hCG in your urine or blood to indicate pregnancy. It is important to repeat your pregnancy test again a few days later, even if you test negative.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.epigee.org/pregnancy/pregnancy_tests.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.epigee.org/pregnancy/pregnanc...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/gettingpregnant/understandpregnancytests.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanpregnancy.org/getting...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.babyhopes.com/articles/bloodtestmoreaccurate.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyhopes.com/articles/bloodt...</a><br>  <br>  a list of things that stop you period<br>  <a href="http://library.adoption.com/articles/becoming-a-woman-things-that-can-affect-your-period.html" rel="nofollow">http://library.adoption.com/articles/bec...</a><br>  <a href="https://www.achievesolutions.net/achievesolutions/en/vzlife/Content.do?contentId=8844" rel="nofollow">https://www.achievesolutions.net/achieve...</a>|`|bb7b4M9Xaa	Look those blood test are pretty damn accurate so its more than likely your not pregnant!  Yes your period is still late, but just might be your hormones playing around with your body, sometimes it happens. <br>  take another blood test in a week. :) <br>  good luck!!|`|96HWpdkFaa	Go back for an ultrasound you could have had a missed misscarige.|`|vsuXCMqzaa	You probably miscarried very very early in the pregnancy in February. Those tests are pretty accurate and if the blood test especially was negative then you weren't pregnant at that time. <br>  <br>  Now it's entirely possible you are pregnant again with a new baby but it's more likely that your harmones are just a bit out of whack right now.<br>  <br>  Take another at home pregnancy test and if it's negative then wait for your period to start. If you don't start within the week then check in with your doctor to make sure of things and to check for an ectopic pregnancy.|`|9hrJfhIIaa	<a href="http://www.babyhopes.com/articles/chemical-pregnancy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyhopes.com/articles/chemic...</a><br>  <br>  This might help explain the positives and negatives...|`|HAueVh8Naa	ok this same thing happened to me .i learned do not take a test till you are actually late because it could have been a chemical pregnancy go look on site peeonastick.com     its tells you lots about false positives|`|OU9xnW86aa	Go back to your doctor for another test.|`|hyp3bvhHaa	the blood tests are very sensitive so i would have to say that at the time of the test being done you were not pregnant although i suppose it is entirely possible you have fallen pregnant since then?

My daughter had eyes like hers when she was born, they changed colors and everything too. She is four now and they are light gray and still change colors from gray with green in the middle to gray and light blue and sometimes light brown. Her eyes will probably keep changing until she is about a year old unless she is like my daughter and they never stop changing colors.<br>  <br>  She is adorable!
2f6diQBiaa	I did the same thing- I took a break and just used progesterone alone for several months. I didn't get pregnant, but it did extend my luteal phase from 7-9 days to 12-14 days. When I take them with Clomid, my luteal phase is extended to 16-18 days. I've heard of women getting pregnant just on progesterone. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!!
plI0WOrUaa	They aren't hiring you because it is very obvious to them that when they do hire you, you will be leaving very, very soon.  I would really wait until after the baby is born.  Maybe go to the daycare now and tell them that you are looking for something for later.  This would be more of an attractive offer to them, rather than start working and leave a few weeks later.  Good luck with the baby and the job search.|`|OBU1eDUHaa	I have a feeling they are not hiring you b/c you are prego.  They don't want to hire someone who will only be able to work for a few weeks, then take maternity leave.  They think they will waste money training you, then you won't come back.  You might have to wait until the baby is born, but keep trying.    Good luck!|`|tz6ksGFkaa	I don't think a company would hire you so close to your due date considering you would then be on maternity leave and a lot of women decide not to return to work after the baby.<br>  I think you should wait.|`|98d8c3e3328b57d9fa0c7f9c021e8603aa	i feel you...i was pregnant and i've been out of work just as long as you have....its hard to find a job since the economy is messed up...it doesn't hurt to try....but i hope you find a job...GOOD LUCK!!!|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I'm 22 weeks along and no one will hire me either.

Good Luck.|`|HOdblqIkaa	same situation i am in so i know how much it sucks. i would go ahead and apply there anyways and see if you can start after you have your baby so that gives you enough time to have the baby and kind of get settled, maybe they wont have any problem with hiring you and then letting you go for a few weeks while you have your baby. that way if you get the job you can just bring your child to work with you because every place i know of allows employees to have their children enrolled there for free or discounted. apply and cross your fingers good luck!|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	I worked at a day care my whole pregnancy up to 33 weeks. It's not the best place to work while pregnant. Your picking up kids all day, there's so many germs, the kids hit and kick, and your on your feet the entire time. The director of mine actually lost her baby because she got really sick from one of the kids. Other than that I don't really have any advice, I just think the day care is a bad idea. Sorry I wasn't more help.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I am truly sorry to say this but they will discriminate against you most likely (even the daycare) and you can't prove it unless they put in writing or you record them saying that they won't hire you because you are pregnant.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	look into the daycare! maybe they will accept you but wont pay you for maternity leave but you could start up after that.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	its not a dumb question but you wont get hired being so close to your due date. sorry
MkKvGdxKaa	Sometimes an egg fertilises but dosent take, and your period comes as normal, or a few days late. It happens more months than we realise. This will result in a false positive, and it's why I hate those really really early tests. The other reason is that although there is a standard as to how much hcg a test can detect, some are more sensitive than others and the strips can differ inside the same brand. so the two next tests you took might not be sensitive enough to detect, or your urine wasnt concentrated enough. I always had a better chance of getting a positive in the evening than in the morning, which although makes little sense, really shows we are all different. It's happened to me a few times, faint positive, neg, neg, positive.Wait until tomorrow and do another test, Really wishing you all the best.|`|2b302d308ce4b1da613b5ad7a99843e2aa	The first faint positive could have been a false positive. Take a pregnancy test every other day either till you get a positive or aunt flo comes to visit. When you get a positive will also depend on when you ovulated. <br>  <br>  Not to get you down but my last period I got 3 faint positives and my blood work was negative. Turns out I had a chemical pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Hope you get your BFP.|`|nuRWvMthaa	You can get a false negative but NOT a false positive!!!!!!!!|`|yp9rEMSraa	I would wait a few more days and then get a good pregnancy test (1st response or clear blue easy)...test with the first morning pee.....You maybe testing to early or dont have enough hormones in your system....Cant tell you what was up with the first test maybe a faulty test?  Best of luck in the days to come....LOTS AND LOTS OF BABY DUST|`|9ncWshWBaa	Find a test that is 10ml then test every 2 days with morning pee. it might be too early so dont get upset if it comes back negative at the moment.<br>  <br>  good luck
uGG69oJyaa	Well I beleive that asking these questions is a good start to educate yourself on age and pregnancy.  Your 22, in truth you have very little to worry about in terms of pregnancy issues.  It does not mean you are immune to them but your at as much risk as anybody else betwen the ages of 18 and 35, barring the famly history of both you and your husband of course. <br>  <br>  Educating yourself is paramount. But if your concern is down syndrome you should know that it is the female that provides the 21st chromosone (spelling) not the male that causes it and for women over 30 it is 1 in every 800 to 1000 pregnancies. Below 18 to 30 it is something to the effect of 1 in every 1600. These numbers are not exact but just to give you an idea.  Yes the older The female is the chance does increase but it is still a rather large bracket of chance.   Women over 45 however are at the highest risk.  1 in 20 or so. Most issues during pregnancy are actually female driven because it is the females health that is crucial to the development of the baby.<br>  <br>  Any man in good health can get a woman pregnant and barring any family history that increases the chance of birth issues or problems(for both the male and female), they will be healthy babies.  Age decreases sperm count yes, sex drive yes, the ability to have sex yes but so long as a male is healthy and can have sex those little guys will swim, no matter how many or how few there are....only takes one, and if they make it to the finish line its because they are healthy. <br>  <br>  If you and your husband are that concerned you can have him take a Spermagram test (atleast I think that's the name), and you can see your gyno etc.  but honestly.....your 22, at this point in your life your a fertile breeding machine.|`|oDqdqLyNaa	There's no problem for a man, but if you are worried about something you should check if your blood type are compatible with one another, so many times they are not and people discover when it's too late!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's actually 40 for both men and women. At least that's what the latest research is claiming.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	nope all is good and over 35 isn't dangerous !!! i am 35 with baby #2 <br>  my dr said he loves to work with gals my age . less drama and more maturity so he doesn't have to baby me .lol|`|kUCVLuTPaa	now is about the right time to start trying because the later you have the baby the higher the chances of miscarriage/ the baby being born with problems...<br>  ~~~BABY DUST~~~|`|E6A8MKZwaa	I don't think age is a concern for the man.  If he is in good health, then his sperm will be in good health.|`|f4d85845a950087316840c62c9b31c06aa	Good question. I've never heard anything about a man's swimmers being too old to not safely reproduce.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	No, as soon as they hit puberty till they die is fine for them to get someone pregnant.
HqOkC2YHaa	the only thing I can suggest is a playpen...yes he will pull up on it, but put it in the middle of the floor so this way if he falls over he will hit his head on the neting of the other side of the play pen<br>  <br>  My daughter is pulling up on everything aswell but she hasn't dare tried her pen yet|`|VJnmHFR0aa	All babies do this, falling down is a part of life, that's why babies wear nappies, so they don't hurt their bums when they fall.  <br>  The more he pulls himself up the steadier he will become, then he'll be coasting, then walking.  You have to allow him to do this.<br>  Put him in his high chair while you're tidying up, at least then you know he's not going to fall while you haven't got all of your attention on him.  It's really all you can do.|`|2F5HNPqPaa	Hopefully it won't be too long before he's more stable.  And congratulations too!  Sounds like he's doing pretty well.  Looking forward to my 6 month old crawling, but dreading it at the same time as he's rolling everywhere and getting into things already - it can only get worse!<br>  <br>  In the meantime, you could try:<br>  <br>  - Sitting him in his highchair with some finger foods or toys while you do things in the kitchen.<br>  <br>   - Putting him in a door bouncer where he can bounce around and strengthen his leg muscles too!  <a href="http://www.babyequipmentcomplete.com/google_detail.php?id=db3&form=1&gclid=CIK9z_an3ZICFRo71Aodq2Qu_A" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyequipmentcomplete.com/goo...</a><br>  <br>  - A playpen (just so you're sure he can't get to things like glass doors!)<br>  <br>  Otherwise grit your teeth and hope for the best!  The best thing to do is probably ensure everything is baby-proofed and take him around the house wherever you're doing things.  I take Lukas upstairs and he plays on the bed whilst I fold clothes, he sits in his highchair when I do the kitchen and plays on the floor whilst I clean the front room.|`|hrMhhB4Saa	thats how kids learn.
PDJbNAZqaa	You both are way too young to stay home. DCFS will not approve of it.<br>  <br>  You are still young to stay home alone. Like I said before, DCFS will not approve of it. Even if you're 'responsible' enough, you're still young.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	I wouldnt leave my 11 and 9 year old home alone either, not until they were 13. Your mom is right, your father, well most are like whatever.|`|LoO9LptJaa	i think you shoul wait a little bit longer until you are completely comfortable caring for your own safety and your brother's =] i started being a "mother's helper" to my aunt when I was 11, and started actually babysitting when I was about 14! Goodluck?|`|AXEqOEloaa	I still think you are too young to be home alone, even tho you might know what to do in an emergency really it is a lot different when you are actually faced with it. Knowing what to do and how to react are totally different.|`|HtX7YsBvaa	well tell your mom that your old enough to do be home alone and beside babysitting your lil bro for you parents should be a good thing cus you care about your brother .
HEdGGmkhaa	Yes, I had a threatened Miscarriage at around 6-7 weeks, I thought I had a cyst on my ovary lol and went to the ER with some bleeding and lo and behold! Pregnant! lol<br>  He is now 4 yrs old :o) I went a week over due so yes you can go all the way :o)|`|yp9rEMSraa	Congrates I am happy for you...I know you are going to have to take it easy for the pregnancy but you should be fine...Im so happy for you...best of luck|`|h4UzjZVnaa	your so lucky! i hope and pray i get my BFP soon! i can test in 6 days!!<br>  congrats!!|`|Y2WMKpHjaa	Congrats!!!|`|o6goJq15aa	yes! I did this very same thing with my last!<br>  I put myself on bed rest... and I did carry til 36weeks!<br>  <br>  She is healthy!!! GOOD LUCK!!|`|obN6p3Cgaa	Congrats and keep on praying  that every thing will be ok.............|`|AA10976444	I have had 2 full term pregnancies, and had vaginal bleeding with both of them.  As long as you have no cramping (I didn't) everything should be ok.  I was told my second was going to be a threatened miscarriage, but it never was.  I have to happy and healthy boys.
YQrKQ5PAaa	Wtf? <br>  <br>  A) Not exactly a question.<br>  <br>  B) It wasn't your relationship to intervene with like that.|`|9zwSclnLaa	I would tell your parents, cause he had no right to hit you for his girlfriend dumping him.  He can't prove it was you who told her.  For all her knows (if she told him you told her) she could be lying.  I would tell my parents.  He's in for it now *smiles diabolically*.|`|dZwE0kBtaa	Give it a breather, and talk to your parents about it, i am sure they will re ensure you. Also thinking on your brothers behalf he probably won't talk to you for ages. So give him some space and i guess just wait till things die down ... everything will be ok in the long run. But it was the right thing to do, although you could of talked to your brother and like explain what he was doing wrong, and if he didn't stop tell him either to dump her or treat her as a person, otherwise you would threaten to tell her the truth.|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	He's not a real man. He punched a girl. He has a right to be mad, because he might have actually loved her. But punching is way out line.<br>  Tell your parents. He's gonna get it now.|`|8Z8yycgYaa	question???
UgIOVl1jaa	There are books you can buy regarding nutrition when pregnant that have recipes & different sections like "what to cook when you don't feel like cooking" & "what to eat when you don't feel like eating" etc.  The one I bought is called "Eating Expectantly" but there are plenty of them out there.  Make sure she's on her pregnancy vitamin too :)<br>  <br>  Sex is fine throughout the entire pregnancy as long as there aren't any complications which the Ob would have told her about.  So as long as the Ob is happy then enjoy!<br>  <br>  Congratulations :)|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	she should take prenatal vitamins with iron, folic acid, calcium, and vit D. yes it is okay to have sex.|`|g7wQij2Oaa	she needs to take prenatal vitamins.. they are very important! make sure she gets all the recommended servings of fruits, veggies, whole grains, and dairy products. tell her to stay away from caffeine, alcohol, and smoking/drugs. <br>  and sex is ok unless the doc says otherwise!<br>  <br>  :)
o6goJq15aa	There is always a chance of pregnancy... I didn't think I was going to get pregnant because I wasn't ovulating... haha boy was I wrong! <br>  I guess I actually ovulated twice that month!<br>  <br>  Anything is possible!<br>  <br>  If your trying good luck, if not... A baby is an amazing gift Cherish it reguardless!|`|HEdGGmkhaa	If you became fertile a  day or so after, YES, if you have already been fertile this month NO|`|XVljoYZ5aa	Keep in mind that sperm can survive nearly a week. So, even if your not due to ovulate for a month, factor in lifetime of a sperm, and the fact that your body is always changing, no matter how regular your cycle, and you could easily be pregnant. You can always ovulate late or early, so ALWAYS use protection if your not ready to be a mom. Your probably not, but its better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to human life.
KDf30Iqjaa	wait til hes asleep! do you have friends or family nearby who could take him for an hour or 2? or what about local soft play area indoors! don't try to do everything or else your work will suffer ! do little bits at a time as that will be better rather than it being rushed! good luck!|`|AfjcRXaiaa	put on a movie or a cartoon that he likes mine loves sponge bob and will watch it for as long as its on.
rFtKFp03aa	I remember getting spanked as a child - I had to pull my pants down... <br>  <br>  It really didn't hurt that much otherwise.. <br>  <br>  So I would say .. if he was just wearing boxers then you still would of had to take them off.. but it sounds like you spank with clothes on.. so <br>  hard to tell.. I think boxers would have been fine though .. <br>  <br>  But If the naughty chair works for him then that is great .. use that first and then go to spanking.. <br>  <br>  and reward him for not saying bad words.. and watch your mouths around him too! <br>  <br>  best wishes|`|iFmKcRl0aa	It sounds to me like you wanted to make sure his behavior was corrected without being unreasonably harsh, and that's a good thing, in my opinion. <br>  <br>  As far as whether you were right in this particular instance, I think you're probably the best judge of that. If his behavior improved that day after you sent him to the naughty chair, I'd say things were okay. <br>  <br>  My husband and I have a rule not to contradict each other in front of our son so we can present a united front to him when he's being corrected. If you disagreed with your wife in front of your son, to me, that would be the bigger error.|`|aMZ7IKysaa	I wouldn't make a big deal about the running around in boxers thing.  He seems to been of a young age since he has a 'naughty chair'.  Other than that, don't feel bad about spanking him when he is in his boxers, my kid gets spanked bare assed!  I don't need clothes getting in the way of the punishment, the point is to make it hurt so he remembers not to do it again!|`|aXYiOskmaa	first, i honestly don't see the problem but this is not an incidence that requires spanking. how old is this kid?|`|MzHwklzKaa	A spanking's a spanking, it doesn't matter what the kid is wearing.<br>  <br>  There is actually more trauma/shame in being hit than there is in the pain of the strike.  <br>  <br>  Plus, spankings are more to prove your point, than it is to raise bruises and harm the child.  <br>  As in:  "I said quit, you chose not to stop, so you get a spank".  <br>  It shows the child you're serious, you mean business, and you won't accept that behavior anymore.<br>  <br>  Any attention you pay to swearing makes it continue.  You can beat that child black and blue, and the swearing won't quit.  <br>  Turn your back.<br>  When the little angel puff says something you don't want him saying, turn you back and go into a different room.  When he quits, smile at him.  Engage him in something positive.|`|ERVib5gYaa	Okay Im not a spanker or a parent but I think you were right because you were being rreasonableand not spanking him for no reason, you thought it was fine because he had his boxers on so it wouldn't make sense if you spanked him anyway, that would be malicious. You're right.|`|pPKhVRXJaa	my kids run around the house in their underpants too, lol. spanking them in underpants is fine. if they don't want to be spanked like that, i'm sure they will figure out that they should put more clothes on.|`|2VdJgenjaa	I'm a parent and a spanker usually hands if my kids reach for something dangerous. I have done two big spanks on my kids one for each. Never had to do it like that again.<br>  <br>  Yes I think you were right to hold off but that's my opinion. I wouldn't smack my kids just for running around even if I was running late.<br>  <br>  We had a similar problem with our oldest son when he was about 5. We started a tick chart. one of his things is 'I will get dressed the first time I am asked.' If he gets 20 ticks on this chart over the week he gets 30 mins on the Wii on the weekend. It works really well give it a go.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Oh right! I read it as just running around! Swearing can be a huge problem not just for you but other kids around will pick it up.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry I haven't had that problem yet so I can't really give you any tried advice. I can't say I would smack my kids for that either thinking about it. But if you use it as a punishment on a regular basis then maybe you should have. <br>  <br>  I would start a swearing chart where that if they swear you take a tick or sticker or what ever away. If they loose all their ticks in a week they miss out on something important.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	um, who cares if your kid runs around in his house in his under pants.  Second of all why would she spank him for it?  Tell her she can spank him when he sticks a screw driver in a electrical outlet while holding onto someones hand. Until then, hands off.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	If your spankers and wanted to spank him, you should have told him to go put on some pants and get ready for his spanking. I absolutely understand that a child shouldn't be calling their parents an 'azz', that's incredibly disrespectful. But by sending him to the 'naughty chair' instead of metering out your usual punishment, you're teaching him that he can get off easy if he just does all his bad stuff while wearing boxers. Make him put on pants next time and then commence the butt-whooping.
AA10742362	my dd eats either cereal with a fruit or veggie twice a day but only about a cup total.  and nurses 6-8 times a day.  shes 5 1/2 months old weighs about 18 pounds and is about 28 inches or so.  what does ur doc say?  mine said not to much food yet cuz nutrients r comin from milk/formula.  how big is ur boy?|`|aGLBgk6gaa	my daughter is going to b 4 months this friday, and im going to start giving her rice cereal, but i have to ask the doc how much and how often do i give her the cereal.
5yAsj29Vaa	I'd like to know how taking a test is a waste of money?  We can't tell you if you are or not.  Grow up and take a test!|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Did you take a test? you might just be spotting. I'd wait until you know FOR SURE that you're pregnant to quit taking your BC.....|`|bTlhBX3daa	Honestly, you need to take a HPT. The cramping and light bleeding could have been Implantation bleeding and cramping. The sore breasts is a definite early pregnancy sign, though it could be a menstrual thing too. And there is NO form of birth control that is absolutely 100% effective. <br>  <br>  The pill is known for helping to regulate women's menstrual cycles, so it should not be causing you to not have a period, rather, it should be causing your period to come every 28 days like clockwork. <br>  <br>  I'd say it's well worth the money to take a test at this point. Good Luck.|`|8wVj8odOaa	well what is more important to you? Drinking or knowing you're pregnant?<br>  <br>  seriously, you can spend a $1 at the Dollar Store for a pregnancy test.. imagine if you did that and got a positive, how much money you would of saved keeping yourself from drinking not to mention the added benefits to your 'possible' baby|`|klTgOEcpaa	well i can tell u one thing use  the drinking money to buy a pregnancy test cause its not worth harming the  baby cause u rather save the money to drink think about it walmart sells cheap one are go to your local health dept|`|HtX7YsBvaa	Just take the test so you can just get over it .<br>  i know you dont want to spend money over that but thats the only <br>  way you can get over it already !|`|5NBJUALFaa	Yeah.. having unprotected sex and getting wasted. my kind of chick!

QwPpLgX7aa	I got Acne at the beginning of my pregnancy really bad (eventually it will heal and you will have beautiful skin).  I know pro active is safe to use.  You should definetly ask your doctor.  When I ask mine he said to make sure there was not a certain ingrediant (I can't remember what it was) MAKE SURE YOU DON'T USE ANYTHING W/OUT ASKING UR DOCTOR!!|`|96HWpdkFaa	Yes  I use st.Ives!|`|UinOWcMUaa	Yeah -- it's an external application, not something you swallow :)|`|EyKJ737daa	Always best not to because you don't know what sort of chemicals are in them as they all have far out and strange names that no one can pronounce!  If you are unable to get in to see your doctor sweetie, ask the pharmacist as they can also give advise on what is safe and what is not during pregnancy.  I'm afraid though sweetie, acne is very normal during pregnancy. Your hormones are all mixed up at present and some women are just unlucky enough to get acne, others don't.  Where possible, try and cut down on your sugar intake and go see the pharmacy/chemist and they will certainly advise what is safe sweetie and what is not.  They usually have all the categories on file as to safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  All the best and good luck.<br>  <br>  Edit: remember that your body is ultra absorbent during pregnancy and breastfeeding so be careful.  Some herbs and stuff are still dangerous to bub even on the inside!  so just because it is not going in by mouth doesn't mean that bub still wont get it so always check with a professional first sweetie, always better to be safe than sorry. GLuck|`|vGxipYJnaa	Yeah it's fine. It's not awfully harsh and it's not like you're swallowing it.|`|AA11838675	Uhhh, yeah.|`|GJjpXeqyaa	of couse its safe|`|aPMEiScnaa	They have a nurses hotline at every hospital and every clinic.  They are just as knowledgeable.  You can call in to your local clinic and they will call you back within the day.  They will answer any questions you have on acne.  <br>  <br>  Although I think with St. Ives you would be safe.  It's noted for being all natural.  Otherwise if you are very worried Burt's Bee's is organic and all natural and made from natural products like food and naturally occurring oils.|`|PwkYJoVgaa	i use that stuff! haha ok well, im not really sure.|`|dwt1sidtaa	St Ives-yes!|`|KmC0K59taa	Yes.  I have always used acne face wash and even throughout my pregnancy.  My baby was fine.|`|DdJnmx7Laa	ask the doctor|`|6VtuN0NIaa	I did and my kids are fine ;)  Good luck!|`|5MBdJK4Baa	my doctor told me not to use anything "medicated"|`|PYQsv6eMaa	yes|`|LCfdK7cQaa	I honestly don't see why not.  There are only herbs and natural ingredients within the lotion; so, I don't see any harm in using it during pregnancy since there are no harmful chemicals.  <br>  <br>  If you still feel somewhat doubtful, and I don't blame you (the health of your baby is EXTREMELY important), then see a doctor for professional advice.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|VtVfOynQaa	yes fine, no antibiotics or anything though, a facewash will be fine.|`|qDPI8jbXaa	Aveno is all natural, and is great for your skin|`|bcSp87xEaa	u know id ask a doctor
AfjcRXaiaa	my son was 3 months when he got bronchitis for the first time. scared me to death he went into respiratory distress was on oxygen, steroids, and spent 2 days in the hospital. we were sent home with albuteral nebulizer treatments every 4 hours for about 3 weeks then just as needed after that. the albuteral nebulizer treatments open the air ways in the lungs to make breathing easier. if its a viral bronchitis then antibiotics will not work and there is no need to take something that wont help. my experience happened about 2 and 1/2 years ago.|`|7c9a6ac2b60c434d81159b0728373573aa	Normally they give and antibiotic and liquid steriod. But it depends on ;how the ped feels about giving antibiotics to infents. My experance is that bronchitis doesn't go away without and antibiotic. If he isn't better in a day or two I would go back to the dr.|`|XbvQiEDxaa	hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm give me some time
o6goJq15aa	YES VERY Normal<br>  I have had 5 kids! With All of them, I got scared thinking I was not pregnant anymore. It just vanished!!! <br>  My last born, who is now 11 months... I actually went in and made my midwife do an ultrasound! I felt better... <br>  <br>  I guess if you think there is something going on than you should not feel strange calling and asking your doctor! You have the right to ask, and have any concerns at ease! <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|HEdGGmkhaa	Yes it's normal, the sore/tender breasts and other symptoms are an effect of the hormones in your system. once your hormones stabilize they tend to ease up on you a little hence the symptoms coming and going.<br>  <br>  You will get them back once you get a rise again so don't speak too soon lol, you will be happily vomiting, aching, getting mad, crying and have sore boobs in no time!<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|OCk7I8JVaa	I had the same thing happen and, for me, it meant a miscarriage. However, I also had cramping and my HPT's were getting lighter. Try taking another HPT but you should also consult your doctor, as disappearing signs this early in pregnancy are not usually a good sign.<br>  I hope everything is ok. Best of luck.|`|yp9rEMSraa	Yes it is normal...you will not have all the symptoms all the time....now that you know you are prego you might be relaxing more and not feeling as many symptoms....You are fine dont worry about it....Congrates on you being prego!!!

You might want to call your doctor. You might be okay. The feelings might come back soon. I had tender breast for a while and then it went away and came back. Just don't stress about it if you can't talk to your doctor.. It's not good for the baby.|`|D0oqTblpaa	Not all women have pregnancy symptoms.

My most fertile days were between the 18th and the 23rd. We had sex a lot during that time and after. Haha. We're still newlyweds. :) I am not on any birth control and we don't even use condoms anymore (the ones with spermicide burn me and sex is nowhere near as good as it is without). <br>  <br>  I am on a 28-29 day cycle and should have started either the 7th or yesterday. I'm not getting my hopes up because I have been stressed lately and that has caused me to skip an entire month.<br>  <br>  Plus, during that entire month I skipped, I took several pregnancy tests and got negatives. I've seen so many negatives that I doubt seeing a positive. That would just crush my spirits.<br>  <br>  Anywho, I'll just have to wait and see what happens. Boy is it fun trying though. :)<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh, and also, other than being slightly late, I've not had any real symptoms. Normally though, I get really bloated before my period and gain about 4 to 5 pounds. I didn't do that this time. My boobs however are sore and I've been emotional. That could be pms and maybe I'm just starting late. :P|`|6Z4fKZ8aaa	My LMP was 2/2/2009.  I'm 7 days late for my period it was supposed to be here 3/1/2009.  I'm going to wait until the end of this month to test just in case my period comes. I don't feel like I'm going to get my period this month. I just feel different this month.  I've been TTC for 29 periods and 29 months.  BFN 12/18/2006 @ 19. BFN 10/30/2008 @ 21.  Two false pregnancies.  I threw up a few nights ago, and I ended up feeling like I wanted to throw up today.  Been having headaches and cramping that's different from my period cramping.  I would be 6 weeks pregnant as of March 9th 2009 according to www.baby2see.com.  Don't get your hopes up and don't stress about it.|`|mZzQQUABaa	OMG!!! <br>  <br>  We have almost the EXACT same cycle...My LMP was Feb. 7, 2009, and mine are AVG. 29 days but have gone 30, which was yesterday, and I still have NO period today (day 31), I dnt even have sore boobs this mo. (and I have it EVERY mo. NEVER Miss) so I am Realllllllyyyy anxious to test!!! Ahhhhh! It's soooo freaking annoying!<br>  <br>  Any who, I'm trying to give it a couple more days, just in case, cause I dnt want to get my or the hubby's hopes up, although they already are! <br>  <br>  Oh, I also had a laparoscopy on Feb. 4, 2009...and my period was actually due on that date, but I had nerves and jitters last mo. because I had to have surgery (it went 31days), I was scared, but it was a piece of cake! (I have heard pregnancy's can sometimes happen rite after this procedure) WISH ME LUCK, AND GOOD LUCK TO YOU, IT DEF SOUNDS LIKE YOU AND I COULD BE LUCKY THIS MONTH!!!! KEEP US UPDATED, I WILL!!!<br>  <br>  BABY-LUCK TO YOU!!!
CFFuFof1aa	I am a democrat and I feel the same way. I am totally against abortion. I think that they should make it where you can only get an abortion if it is medically neccasary or if a child was raped and became pregnant. With me, I would never ever get an abortion unless they told me that I would die if I carried the baby. If I didn't want the baby or if I had been raped, I would give the baby up for adoption. I think that under no circumstances should abortion be used as a form of birth control. It p*sses me off when I here people getting abortions because they were the irresponsible ones who got pregnant and didn't want the baby. The least thing that they could do would be carry the baby 9 months and give it up for adoption. There are people (like me) everyday who tries to get pregnant and can't. I've had two miscarriages in the last 6 months. It just p*sses me off to think about someone murdering a poor baby that didn't ask to be brought into this world, adn yes it is alive, they have heartbeats!!!!!!!|`|R8fVBPnmaa	I too wish it was illegal !!... btw if I did vote I feel strongly that my vote would be DEMOCRATIC !!.,. & yes I truly do understand that medically an abortion might be called for !?! & or the best solution medically for a persons health maybe !?! ...

SmVxLo1aaa	I love having Lee as a middle name for a girl and barry for a boys middle name is good too. The name Cullen is great for a boy, and so are the other boy names, but I may have to say that the girl names are a bit too abstract. Maybe shorten it to like "Lexi" or something. But, they are still pretty...just way too abstract and weird!!|`|CxRJwJsraa	I could maybe live with Rumour. Even though "rumors"  are usually bad.<br>  I really don't care for Alexanna. I'd much rather see Alessandra.<br>  Lextacy is horrible. I'm sorry.

MLPzeOtOaa	I think some people need their questions answered or advice is needed and since you kind of have to be pregnant to get an abortion , this would be the place. If you dont want to read about it, dont click on that question.|`|7HxJvbjMaa	Codizmama, in AMERICA abortion is LEGAL and freedom of speech is a RIGHT. <br>  What section should they post their question in? They're pregnant aren't they?|`|D0oqTblpaa	What's not fair is reading abortion or Plan B questions in the TTC section.  That's for women (many with fertility problems) who need a shoulder or some advice.  <br>  <br>  Most abortion and Plan B questions are serious and not trolls trying to get a rise out you.  They deserve the same respect as any woman on this board.|`|BxrU8kUJaa	Very few of the questions sneak the abortion issue past you with a catchy title and then slam you with it when you click on the question.<br>  <br>  Here's an idea, exercise some self-control and bypass the questions that offend your gentle sensibilities.|`|gDEFlWnOaa	I'm sick of hearing people argue about it. Some people like it, some don't. If you don't like questions about abortions and it is obvious that a question contains it, then just don't read the question.|`|39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	I disagree, no one is forcing you to read the questions and descriptions in this section, much less making you be on this site.|`|haabfMtkaa	I would consider this a opinion question too<br>  so in my opinion I think all women should have some where to go if they are in crisis that is some what confidential <br>  how would you feel if you were raped per say and ended up pregnant and you were humm 16 and you felt to scared to go to your parents or your priest  and this place was all you had <br>  I know I am thankful that people have the RIGHT to ask the tough to hear questions whether or not I agree is besides the point|`|4FFr21oWaa	i agree completly. hell if you want an abortion, you should be safe in the first place, why should anyone have the right to murder their own baby?|`|HYveAhbUaa	This is for asking questions, they have questions as well.  There is nothing on the rules here that say this is only for us who are keeping our babies.|`|Og09Q7ylaa	Oh, get a grip. Abortion is no big deal. Why does it matter where the questions go?|`|XCtKpwkwaa	well this is the pregnant section and they are pregnant too. <br>  <br>  so if you dont want to hear about it dont open it
Uxx1hc5Zaa	I think it makes a lot of sense to let your kids hang around them because they can learn from the other person's mistakes.|`|aMZ7IKysaa	I got pregnant at 17 (I am now 24), and I can say that if I had experienced more teen mother scenarios, it most likely would have put me off the idea.  I can honestly say that when my daughter is a teenager, I would definitely let her around them, but I would monitor it.  Teenagers have a way of glorifying things, especially girls and how they think its so cute to have a baby.  I would just remind her of all of my struggles, and I plan to stress academics and sports with her.  Girls that are too busy with other things have a smaller window for fault.  No one is immune, but there are ways of teaching our kids to be responsible.  I wish someone would have taught me.

zSEJC6vZaa	Whoa.  The mama bear in me is growling and ready to rip off some heads.<br>  <br>  What those boys are doing to you is sexual harassment and it's flat out WRONG.  They are being completely stupid, disrespectful, and disgusting towards you.  Sweetie, you deserve much better friends than these moronic imbeciles.    <br>  <br>  Don't just ignore them.  Get angry and tell them to stop.  Tell your boyfriend to make them stop too and if he doesn't, you really need to reconsider the relationship.  Frankly, if I were you, I'd be making all sorts of demeaning comments about the size of their miniature penises but you're probably a more gracious person than I am.  <br>  <br>  While your parents are busy, I'm sure they would want to know this is happening to their daughter.  I know if I were your parent, I would.  If you don't feel comfortable talking to them about it, talk to a teacher you trust and respect.  Make an appointment with the guidance counselor to tell him or her what is going on.|`|obN6p3Cgaa	ignore them.....|`|4e67Pdfvaa	none of that matters except for the sexual harasment you are getting at school.  I would press charges... you could get raped at this rate.|`|HYveAhbUaa	I had the same label in school for no apparent reason, it sucked really bad.  Mostly if you can't move you just have to deal with it, fighting back against them only fuels the fire, but I will say that once you go to college, its a brand new fresh start.  Not so reassuring while you are in school, but college was a whole new world for me.  Eventually, if you don't fight back they will get bored and you will be old news.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	well sounds like you need to tell them to stop being jealous and for their 411 your not pregnant.

4kyGIaZYaa	tell them and tell them how bad you need a job. its wrong to get hired, then tell them your pregnant and you expect to take maternity leave or short-term disability to be home with the baby. if it is a good job, then they will take you in and support you.|`|lJc9elfpaa	Technically you don't have to give them that information at interview. But, I work in healthcare as well and understand that it's not the job to hide that you are pregnant. You can be exposed to many dangerous things- diseases and illnesses like shingles (which you cannot be exposed to when pregnant)- have to lift heavy objects and people, etc. Plus, many heatlhcare jobs will not allow you to work when you cannot lift a certain amount of weight. I worked in nursing home that did this. Whn my cooworker had weight restrictions from a breast biopsy they made her stay home until she was allowed ot lift again (even though she never had to lift more than 5 lbs.)|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well at four months you should tell them because it won't be long before you start to show and you can't use the excuse you didn't know.|`|txv7TIgiaa	well you need to tell them cuz you cant lift patient|`|Wk7fIw4Laa	I understand that you need a job but employers like people that are up front and honest with them. If it was me, I would tell them that I'm pregnant. It could save a lot of grief later.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	This is always a tough one.  You are probably less likely to get hired if they know you're pregnant because they know you're going to require a good deal of time off pretty soon.  However, if you don't tell them, you look dishonest.  It's a choice you'll have to make on your own.|`|H2IhRXIIaa	Hmmm, To be honest I wouldnt say anything...unless they ask..being pregnant wasnt in the job describtion was it...so to me its non of the biz, because they cant fire you once they find out..thats against the law...
2b302d308ce4b1da613b5ad7a99843e2aa	EWCM is a good sign that you did ovulate. Yes you do have a good chance of getting pregnant this cycle if you had sex anytime from 2 days before to one day after ovulation, it is best to have sex once every 24 to 48 hrs when ovulating. You can also try temp charting, or ovulation test if you don't get your BFP this month.  The only thing you can do right now is to wait and see if your period comes or not. <br>  <br>  Hope we both get our BFP!|`|aa01690707f25106fb64b7b4af022300aa	why are your periods so out of wack?|`|yp9rEMSraa	If you are seeing the EWCM I think that you did ovulate and have a chance of being prego....obviously you know you have to wait but.....there is a chance that you might not ovulated but i doubt that your CM would have been so much....I wish you the best of luck and lots and lots of baby dust!!|`|Npy1kswWaa	Yes and I want to wish you the best luck
Fd4lITkvaa	An ice pack is the right thing to do. He will be ok. After you get your 3 month old calmed down your 2yr old needs an instant time out and needs to know what she did wrong when she gets out. Most things warrant a warning but biting and hitting should be an instant time out without a warning first.|`|S4y7V4diaa	You need to sit down with her and the baby I suggest now while he is crying and show her how much she hurt him and ask her how she would feel if someone bit her and made her cry. Try to put her in his position without scaring her and DON'T bite her! I hate people who do that.|`|AA10120592	My daughter did the same thing to her sister...twice with-in 25 minutes when my yougest was about 6 weeks. the first time, i told her it wasn't nice, and see that it makes the baby cry. the second time, i bit her on her finger. she never did it again. these were not little bites she did, she left really deep marks on the babies finger. i know i'm gonna get thumbs down, but my mom did it to my younger sister and it worked just the same as it did for me.|`|AfjcRXaiaa	bite her back to let her know that it hurts and tell her not to do that again or she will get bit again. sounds mean but it works you don't have to bite hard just hard enough to let her know it hurts.|`|dMLLQruOaa	Well, for a 2 year old trying to punish him longer than 2 minutes after the incident is pointless. She already forgot that she did this i am sure. I would sit her down and show her his "boo boo" and tell her that "We do not bite Isaiah, it hurts him and we dont like when Isaiah is hurt." I would repeat that a few times. If it happens again, an immediate timeout should be in order. I always do a timeout in a chair near a wall that has nothing distracting to look at. A 2 year old will not know what she is doing there if there is already too much going on in her timeout. I wouldnt give her attention until her timeout is done, then another talking to about "Why we dont do this" so she remembers why she was there.<br>  <br>  *As far as the healing, you are doing all you can. Just keep an eye on it and be gentle with his fingers of coarse. This happens often at this age. They are just curious, especially with babies.
Faw2iBtfaa	My lmp was Feb 7, last Thursday (12 dpo) my level was 44, today (16 dpo) they are 222.  Nobody said anything to me that I wasn't around my fourth week.  Everyone is different, they can tell better after the first ultrasound.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Every womans hcg levels rise at different rates...since there is a question on how far along they will date the fetus using an ultrasound.  As long as your levels are doubling like they should they there is no reason to worry.|`|zimmLBb4aa	everyone is different so its really hard to say. What i would say is...stop, wait and try and do something to keep ur mind off it all. I know that is so so difficult because everything you look at reminds you of babies, but i found when my mind was dealing with somethings else i was so suprised when i found out i was pregnant. So you need to try and destress, because this just wont help anyone. lots of luck x

Personally, as a mother who nursed and pumped, I would maybe take it to a minimum of 2 hours in between, but you do what you are comfortable with.  Good luck with your milk, it does a body good!
obN6p3Cgaa	Take the blood test at the doc.........|`|uV54p794aa	Of course you could be pregnant. It can happen at any time, because all women's bodies are different. So the possibility that you are pregnant depends on your own body's timing.<br>   The period you are talking about during pregnancy is not a true period, but known as Implantation Bleeding. It's a lot like a period, often starting out pinkish, turning into almost a dark rusty color at the end. It's perfectly normal, often happening with the first pregnancy.  <br>  It's still early for a test, they have the ones that you can use like a week before you expect your period, so calculate & purchase one when the time is right. If you're still not convinced, go to the OB/GYN & get the blood test that measures your HCG hormone level. THAT one is the best test to get if you think you may be pregnant. gl!|`|Cq7vnrFhaa	take the test at the doctors but i think you might be if his penis did go into the vigina

PDcnXgE6aa	So congrates u become mom..........its almost sure|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Dreams are concocted out of your subconscious.  Your mind plays out a variety of things you've thought of or have experienced.  If the thought of pregnancy ever occurred to you or you thought or or want a baby girl, that's why you dreamed that.  It doesn't mean you're pregnant.|`|kT7GVOosaa	dreams are random. you could be pregnant because you had sex but dreaming about a baby is not a symptom. dont worry.|`|5MBdJK4Baa	your mind is running

The best I can suggest is to look into sex education programs and see if any near you will let you borrow one.

RhHv5pYwaa	Stop thinking about it so much and allow your body to become pregnant. Even if it comes out it one takes one little guy to make your little dream some true but if your body is worried and stressed it will take longer. Believe me I know.

cfdooGylaa	Buy tape and call the person who told you that up. Then put the tape over their mouth so they can stop spreading that nonsense!|`|UYfqzCoMaa	NOT TRUE!!! You CAN still get pregnant.|`|cv0foxlTaa	I'm no expert, but I'm going to tell you that if you want to avoid pregnancy, rely on traditional birth control methods such as condom and birth control pill.  I am pretty darned sure that saliva is not an effective form of birth control.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	where does this stuff come from? Spit wont kill sperm especially the millions and millions that are in a drop of ejaculate. Sheesh... thats like saying I I put milk in there I cant get pregnant. Ignorance but good thing you asked. Please get on the pill or wear a condom every time and correctly. <br>  HEY TO 24 WEEKS... so what if saliva can kill a few sperm, your going to back up this crazy notion with the possibility that saliva kills enough sperm to not get pregnant? just throwing in the additive that "you can still get pregnant" doesnt help. Well the bacteria in the vaginal canal can kill sperm too but not enough to make a difference. Saliva is NOT a birth control form and doesn't make it alright to go spouting it as a well know fact. Nothing like confirming what these people think is an acceptable form of birth control.|`|98WKYtfwaa	There have been many studies done on what influences sperm survival. And most studies show that saliva can have a negative effect on sperm. If he has enough sperms then it's unlikely to make a major difference, but if he has a low sperm count then you need every single sperm.<br>  <br>  Saliva throws off the delicate ph balance and introduces outside bacteria. These things kill sperm - they aren't terribly hardy to begin with. Regular lubricants do the same thing - they are too thick for the sperm to swim through and the ph balance is all wrong. <br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, you can still get pregnant using saliva. People on here ought to look up the facts before they go slagging people off. <br>  <br>  So in answer to both of your questions - yes.|`|3y0jPzgSaa	haha no  no no no no no no no nooooo NOT true!!! omggg....wow|`|HoonZJMgaa	Of course you can get pregnant. i never heard of such a thing but whether its true or not, there ain't that much spit in the world because if it were true, I would not be pregnant with number 7! Good Luck!|`|YuA7a08Maa	I definitely don't think that's true.  But air can kill sperm, so if it's outside for a long time, it won't get you pregnant.|`|VsOMJbl4aa	Not true.. But if you use lube with spermicide it can kill the sperm.|`|E1sJZVaOaa	Lol no
mcywqcHuaa	simple: <br>  don't tell her.<br>  <br>  also, don't get pregnant|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	That type of stuff isn't meant to be told to parents, unless you are pregnant, which I doubt you are. Even though she loves you she doesn't want to hear it. I think her way of telling you was to say what she did when you asked her when you watched Juno. If I were a parent I would educate my child on staying abstinent but I doubt that would happen so I would also teach her about safe sex. Now if my daughter was under 15 and I found out she would have to split with her boyfriend and I would have her under tight surveillance.  I would be upset finding out she had done it before 18 or married but if it was under 15 I would be furious.|`|XgSysUjnaa	dont tell her unless you want to go to boarding school.|`|AA10256129	If you think you are too young to have sex then you shouldn't tell her. Maybe she just said that to scare you and she doesnt want you to grow up too fast but if she really loves you and if you love him,i dont think she would send you to a boarding school. You should just be honest with her. At least you were responsible enough to have safe sex. Good luck!!!|`|hWe8vhKKaa	dont have sex again but tell your mom the truth she might let you of this time|`|Rbb3rqPQaa	Why do have want to tell her?|`|kouLTJBJaa	Mom I'm having responsible safe protected sex with my boyfriend who I'm in a committed monogamous relationship with.

Best of luck :)|`|c3CVY87caa	Alonzo Elias Martinez is a good name; adding Callen makes it a bit much.<br>  <br>  Alonzo Elias is a very good name though.|`|mfRH2Wiiaa	I think that is a strong and GREAT name.|`|A1PLJKhUaa	Sorry but I don't like Alonzo. I don't like it as an individual name and I don't think that it works well with Alijah, which is a beautiful name.<br>  <br>  Also, I would combine Craig and Allen to make something like Callum. Callen sounds wierd and it reminds me of the word 'callous'.<br>  <br>  In the place of Alonzo, I would substitute David. It's a lovely, masculine name that is easy to pronounce and it sounds very well with Alonzo. It's also available in variants in many different languages.|`|EFzXvfbQaa	i dislike it very much how about<br>  <br>  Cassius<br>  Romeo<br>  Levi<br>  Cruz<br>  Fabian<br>  Carlos...?|`|xpUyH0psaa	alonzo sounds real good and the whole name flows well.|`|pl7lWGZDaa	I don't like Alonzo. It reminds me of Little House on the Prairie. I do, however, like Callen and Elias. Why not just combine the two and name the baby Callen Elias Martinez or Elias Callen Martinez? We named my little brother after both of my grandfathers, I think it's a wonderful way to name a baby. Alonzo Callen Elias Martinez is just too much of a mouthful! Good luck.|`|vdVVZiY6aa	Alonzo isn't my favorite name, but I don't think it is a bad name.  I Like that you are using family names though.  You could always use Jose for the middle name again too though, I know many siblings with the same middle name.  It's not very original, but you could do it. If you guys both Like the name though, then go for it!  What about these though too?<br>  Isaiah <br>  Izak <br>  Ian <br>  =]|`|4sMQwCgdaa	i really like the name Callen, it has an interesting background coming from both of your father's names and its really unique, i think Callen would a really great first name|`|vgQBoU4Uaa	I like Callen Alonzo Elias Martinez better|`|nXQ8CJgiaa	Kind of hard to pronounce.

I mean.  My parents did the same thing with me and my sisters and I have nothing but resentment over it.  It made it very difficult for others to keep us straight - in fact, by highschool most people gave up and just called us both by my sister's name or, worse, some strange amalgamation of the two.  It was horrible and frustrating and I strongly advise against it.<br>  <br>  Callen Elias is a beautiful name.  Why not go with that instead of Alonzo?  It doesn't spell anything funky, it flows beautiful.

fQEn8PCHaa	I'm sorry to hear your life is so chaotic and difficult right now. <br>  <br>  I don't think your parents should be telling you those things, but keep in mind they are human and they will make mistakes. This for instance is a huge mistake -- the cheating, the blaming and taking it out on their children.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind this has nothing to do with you! This is their relationship, not yours. They are your parents, but they are adults too and it is their responsibility to fix their own problems, not blame it on their son.<br>  <br>  As for your girlfriend, be very careful because a pregnancy would not help you now and you are a little young to be having sex. Also, try to help your girlfriend understand you are in a dark place and sometimes you just need her to sit next to you and say nothing. You just need her there. Period. DO NOT cheat on her, it may feel good at first but you will regret it 1,000 times more than how great it felt, especially if you have sex with your other friend.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, DON'T BLAME YOURSELF. Life throws us ugly curve balls and we just have to roll with the punches. Don't start drinking or doing drugs too much either because that won't help you get out of this, it'll just cloud your mind for the worse. <br>  <br>  It's understandable that you don't feel love right now, it happens. The most important thing to do is to use your sad/negative energy to do something productive; work hard at a job, concentrate on school/scholarships, find an extra activity you'll love. Trust me, it will help. Use this awful time as fuel to make your life better. You are the only one that is going to make your life better. No one else is going to do it for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|0bxJgiHuaa	Aw! I am so sorry! <br>  <br>  My dad cheated on my mom too. My parents did not act so severe about it but my mom threatened me if i ever spoke about my dad.<br>  <br>  It got better but it still makes me angry.<br>  <br>  My advice to you is to not cheat on your gf. please don't you know how it feels to be cheated on so do not do it back.|`|L6acUNBcaa	You say don't recommend a psych or school counselor, because you won't go, but really, read that sentence a couple times for yourself. Don't you think that sounds just a tiny bit ignorant?<br>  <br>  School counselors, or at least most of them, are there to help you. I should know, I've only seen about 12 counselors in the past 4 years. Sorry for the sarcasm, but you get my point, right? Honestly, they do help.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying you have to accept my answer, far from it, do whatever you want. Thumb me down, whatever. I've had my rough times, I've seen counselors and they do help. That's my point of view.<br>  <br>  I really hope you can motivate yourself enough to go to one, even if it's just once. Give it a shot. For your own sake. You are confused, as you say yourself, you feel bad and it's just too much at once. And hey, you are only human! You just need to find a way to get to the end of the tunnel, to see the light that will make you feel better.<br>  <br>  Good luck and hang in there! x|`|NX4rewuWaa	Well, cheating is never the answer. And you dont want to be like your father and do the same thing to your girlfriend, and you never break a promise. So no CHEATING.<br>  The nightmares will eventually go away, but they definitely wont go away if you cheat. So dont even think about it, think about your girlfriends feeling.<br>  Sex isn't a big deal, it does sound like your using her if all you want is sex from her. Get over it and suck it up. Do it when shes ready and you are again.<br>  I hope things get better family wise though.|`|rZFYeGwxaa	Hi there.<br>  Well, I'm a 17 year old girl, so I'm close in age to you.<br>  If you were a friend of mine, I would tell you to see a counselor. That's just me. Because I have friends in worse situations than you (drugs, depression, suicidal tendencies) who see a counselor, and they are getting better because of it.<br>  HOWEVER, since that is NOT the answer you want to hear, I'll try to give you some other advice.<br>  Make sure you set things straight with your girlfriend. You seem to really love her; cheating on her would not be a good thing and you might lose something you really care about.<br>  I'd keep some space, at least for the time being, between your female best friend. That might help to repair things with your girlfriend.<br>  Sex is not the answer. Never will sex make things better. If you're horny, make out with her, or something like that. In the long run, sex will just complicate things and make it harder to fix a relationship.<br>  Make sure when you're around your girlfriend that you DO smile, you DO laugh. At least she'll feel better when you're around her.<br>  As for your parents, try seeing if you can move in with a close relative for a few weeks...see if your mom can blow some steam. she should not be blaming you for what happened. You were a good son for telling her, not a bad one for ending an already sour relationship.<br>  Just remember that what your dad did was in no way your fault, and you are still a great son.<br>  Good luck, and chin up dearie. =)|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	Your screwed up because of your parents. Its not your fault. Though it will be your fault of upsetting you gf if you cheated. Don't let that friend that is a girl over anymore. Its not right. Instead ask your gf. She wants to comfort you so let her. Move out of your mothers house as soon as you can, maybe into some relatives house.

DDYwnut6aa	A typical luteal phase (time between ovulation and your period) is 10 to 16 days.   So ovulation can happen anywhere from 10 to 16 days before your next period is due. You should remember that sperm can live for 3-5 days waiting for the egg, and have intercourse accordingly.   I would begin 19 days before your period comes and have intercourse every other day until you're 10 days away from it.   <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|lTkYWiy5aa	The best time to try to conceive is when you're ovulating. You ovulate approximately 14 days before your period starts. You should be having sex the whole week before you expect to ovulate. The very best way to ensure you hit your fertile window is just to have sex 2-3 times a week. It has the added advantage of being easier to figure out and avoids the difficulty of having timed sex.<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust!!!|`|bcZSIphUaa	Work out when you're ovulating (2 weeks before your period) and make sure that you ""baby dance"" around that time!<br>  <br>  Try this for 6 months - if no luck then it's time to go to your doctor and get you and your partner checked for infertility.<br>  <br>  I tried for 6 months and had no luck...went to doctor and found out that I have PCOS.|`|91X4AdVLaa	Its about 14 days after your period starts. Thats when you are most fertile. So if you started last night have sex on and around the 23rd. I would do the 19th, 21st, 23rd, and the 25th. You should be good.

a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	A move would require an update to your homestudy.  If you move out of state (assuming you are in the US), sometimes an entirely new homestudy is required, depending on state law.|`|355b8dca4624a65380892a4d414c9d3faa	You could complete a homestudy now. Most likely only an update would be required after you move even if you move out of state. That's what happened for us.<br>  <br>  Just check with the worker doing the homestudy.|`|zs1C1G1waa	You are required to do a homestudy update for a move.  The background checks, registries, fingerprinting, financial documents I think would still be fine, but you would do another visit with a soicial worker who would replace the description of your old home with a description of your new home and accomodations for a child.  This is if you are still in the same state.  I think you would have to do a whole new homestudy if you move to a different state because different states have different requirements and require different things in the homestudy.  So, I think you would be okay starting a homestudy knowing the process is long IF you know you will be settled by the time of placement and if you will be in the same state.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Adopting from foster care can take as little as 6 months to 1 year.  You must be going through an agency.<br>  <br>  Either way, they want the child to be placed in a stable living environment.  If you are moving, or move shortly after placement, that is not conductive of a "stable" environment.  A homestudy would probably be done in the new home as well to assure that it's still a good environment.  <br>  I'd suggest waiting til you move...or at least get settled into your rental...before doing the homestudy.  Ask your caseworker what they suggest.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	You may have to go through it more than once no matter what the situation is.  Is it really that much of a bother?  There are going to be other things that are going to be tedious.  I would suggest speaking with whomever you are going to adopt from and ask them what their opinion is.<br>  Perhaps you should just put it off until you can commit more fully.|`|AXshzI0Kaa	Wait until you move to the temporary location and start it there and then when you move again to the new permanent location have it updated there. <br>  <br>  Not sure about private studies but those completed by an agency and carried by an agency have to be updated periodically anyway (annually??). the first time is rather prolonged with the successive inquiries slightly abbreviated. <br>  <br>  If you started it right now, and then moved in a few months, that would be an initial and then an update (probable) and then when you moved again in 6 months to a year....once again. <br>  <br>  Don't take the rudeness to heart. People behind computers can be ogres. <br>  <br>  Good luck on your move and on your plans to adopt.|`|9leE3pXaaa	Yea I don't see the connection between selling your house and being unstable or uneducated... mmmm, I guess they mean inform yourself in an office.

Don't force it, if it doesn't come off, just keep trying it every day.  The oil will soften the cradle cap to make it easier to come off.|`|png0sxZnaa	Definatley olive oil, warn not hot.<br>  <br>  Apply the oil and gently massage the cradle cap off.

How the heck would that be possible? It's not.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	no, you must have sex to get pregnant....|`|HOdblqIkaa	if you had sex, got pregnant, had an abortion, and began birth control pills, but did not have sex again then you would not get pregnant. its not the abortion or the birth control that is keeping you from not getting pregnant, its not having sex.|`|fff3c3d8688e389a4670babefc9db6ebaa	Oh wow. Just wow.|`|qgJLZPDJaa	yeah. thats how i got pregnant. no sex. <br>  duh.|`|PWS0x8Gwaa	Typically abortions don't impair a woman's ability to have a baby forever. I'm not really sure what you're asking, but i think that's it, so I'll answer like it is. And you may not be able to get pregnant while you're taking birth control, but if you stop taking it, then you will be able to get pregnant soon after. But no pregnancy can occur without sex, so if you don't have sex, you won't get pregnant, pills or no pills, abortion or no abortion.|`|de2a2663fe4b3d02deeeda407aee1db1aa	If your asking after an abortion you were on the pill and then had sex, then stopped taking the pills then yes you could be pregnant. However the chances are highly unlikely. If the sexual intercourse took place while you were on the pill. If you didn't have sex than NO there is no way to be pregnant.|`|2e64b25984a4dae163c1fac6a3ee7167aa	That's a dumb question. Think before you ask questions on this website. People are judging you on your intelligence. No one can get pregnant spontaneously, its either through sex or medically implanted. Duh!|`|tkqV2CI5aa	honey you can NOT get pregnant if you don't have sex unless you get injected by a doctor with a sperm.
JJsYgKNqaa	If smacking dont work, then you need to turn ignorant. Just because she doesn't like socks tough, she has to wear them because you say so! Your the boss, and you need to put her in the right place. If she starts screaming, you ignore her because shes only doing it to have her own way. And she knows shes getting away with it. if she starts screaming ignoring her will help cos eventually she will calm down. If she hits you hit her back, every time she hits you hit her back, and be serious..She will eventually give up cos she knows she wont win. Don't give rewards, nor pocket money, because shes getting the glory for being naughty, and she knows it. I know its easier said than done, but my little sister was very similar, and I managed to put her straight and it works. If things still get out of hand, then I suggest you go see someone. But please DONT let her get her own way all the time, because she will just get worse.|`|uP08b6K4aa	Well hitting is NOT the answer, it will in fact makes things a lot worse.<br>  <br>  Although you say you've tried everything, have you been consistent in the discipline, by that I mean not trying it for one or two days, keeping it going for weeks?  Children have a fairly short memory so any discipline you use, needs to be followed through for quite a while before it has any far reaching effects.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, go and see your GP who will be able to put you in touch with a health professional who can assess the situation and give you some other methods of trying to control any further bad behaviour.<br>  <br>  As she's well behaved in school, there's every chance that she's just letting go of any frustrations she has (maybe something has happened or is happening in school that she feels she cannot discuss with the teacher).  Sometimes you have to ignore such behaviour and not make such a fuss about getting her what she wants, by running around getting a particular pair of socks or other item of clothing, she's getting 100% attention from you, if you ignore it, you may find it'll go away.<br>  <br>  I hope you find something that works, it must be incredibly frustrating.<br>  <br>  Good Luck x|`|547cda86a737eee48c045921b9b5afa1aa	the fact that's shes so well behaved at school says the problem is with you. please dint take it the wrong way-she behaves at school because there are clear boundaries and she knows if she misbehaves there are consequences.please go talk to your health visitor as they can help you and your daughter sort this out. good luck hun|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	If that were my child she would get a spanking if the other things didnt work. Maybe also get her a child shrink as well.<br>  <br>  Parents need to spank their children more, and those who dont wonder why their kids are so bad. If you dont chose to spank their kids thats fine, but you cant let them act like that, as a parent it is your job to keep your child in line, give her a smak on the but and get her a shrink, after a while of that she will learn|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	Ive never met a child under 12 who hurt themselves and sexual abuse wasnt the cause|`|5apGkgS9aa	your too soft get a bit mean|`|6nUprmu5aa	Hurting herself is a form of manipulation. I bet she has a room full of toys. If my child ever hit me she wouldn't have anything. The other verbal battles are small. Tell her you're willing to work things out and compromise(to a degree), but physically hurting you or herself is unacceptable. Teach her to express herself in the calmest manner possible. If she hits you or hurts herself, you clear out her room completely and see how she likes sitting in an empty room with nothing for an hour.|`|jEzF8iUFaa	hi<br>  <br>  I think you need to tell your GP and get some professional advice?<br>  <br>  also maybe social worker or some childrens organisation surestart?<br>  <br>  but i think GP NURSE OR SOCIAL WORKER.<br>  <br>  Get the help before it gets worse and as shes not listening to you anything can happen as shes growing up?<br>  <br>  some children do the opposite and blame their parents and this gets the parenst in courts etc?

XQuprZxUaa	I was the same way. I had all day sickness. I did go to work however at the beginning I had to use all of my sick days because I was so sick that I couldn't get out of bed. I then started getting better as the time went on. Towards the end however I had to go from full time to part time because I then was sick as well. This time around( being pregnant) it was the same with vomitting however I am far more tired and can hardly get around. I had to switch from full time to part time already and I am only 6 months along. Good luck|`|tkqV2CI5aa	I am the same way with this pregnancy, i was so sick, i couldn't even get out of bed or do anything, then they said my prenatal vitamins were making me sick, so i stopped them and took flinestones w/ iron and a tum, one of both in the morning & night, then i started doing aloooot of veg, fruit and laid off the caffine, i started walking during the day and it made me feel sooo much better, i get up not being sick, feeling great and enjoying pregnancy. Good luck!
FhEUCrttaa	It depends on what happens. I had a c-section and my son was in NICU for 5 days. Total payment was 34000. Hospital took 50% off the top. Insurance paid 80%. My part due was 5 grand, this included everything. The reason I only paid 5000: that is my deductible per year.|`|q1YDp1y3aa	Circumcision runs between $150-$500 depending on where it is done and one the individual doctor. Generally it is cheaper (and safer!) to get it done at the pediatricians office than in the hospital. That said, have you considered not circumcising?<br>  <br>  The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.<br>  <br>  Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?<br>  <br>  Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2...</a> (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)<br>  <br>  You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...</a><br>  <br>  You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....<br>  <a href="http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...</a><br>  <br>  Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...</a><br>  <br>  The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. <a href="http://www.icgi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icgi.org/</a><br>  <br>  It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with. It was virtually unknown in this country until the 20th century.

In Australia and Canada, the rate is down to 10%.  Britain France Germany Italy have rates near zero.   Some studies point to a mild health benefit.  But it really isn't sufficient to cut of a healthy body part that has a good function. The fact is that being intact causes no problems, so why do it? You can see the answers to the myths here:<br>  <a href="http://pharmtips.com/2008/11/27/dispelling-myths-about-circumcision/" rel="nofollow">http://pharmtips.com/2008/11/27/dispelli...</a><br>  <br>  The foreskin has a function.  It contains many specialized nerves on it's underside.  When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable.  Circumcised men have lost this ability to masturbate easily as there is no gliding effect.  Circumcised men often have to resort to artificial lubrication in masturbation and sex.  See here for the function of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  Without the foreskin protecting the glans, circumcised men lose further sensitivity.  The glans (head of the penis) dries out.  It also brushes on underwear causing the skin to toughen.  See here for the full damage done:<br>  <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm</a><br>  <br>  There are good reasons to believe that sex is better for the woman as well, if the man has his foreskin intact:<br>  <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F/doctor_northrup.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F...</a><br>   <br>  Care for an intact boy is easier.  Just a few things you should know:<br>  The foreskin is attached to the glans at birth (they have to break this seal to perform the circumcision - this is excruciatingly painful - not that the pain is the worst part of circumcision ) <br>  You should never pull back the foreskin or try to clean under it.  It requires no care.<br>  The foreskin should be left to become retractable on it's own , it should not be forced.  The foreskin becomes retractable by itself.  this occurs any time up until the end of puberty, though the average age is 5-10 years.  Until then, nothing to do.  A lot of doctors are not familiar with this - don't let them retract it.<br>  Once it becomes retractable, there is little care - just wash it like any other body part.  It is not dirty - if it was then women would be a lot dirtier.  Most men worldwide (75-80%) are intact and have no problems.<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/</a><br>  <br>  Circumcision carries a lot of risks:<br>  <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Complic.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumstitions.com/Complic.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.catholicsagainstcircumcision.org/cac_complications.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholicsagainstcircumcision....</a><br>  There is a lot more after care.

NiKuG6RYaa	they are adorable!<br>  congrats on your baby!|`|PpJEaCpCaa	i love the name Madelyn Faith|`|FL67UPPHaa	I really like Joseph, but I think Graham is slightly outdated. I think the names would be better switched round -- Joseph Graham.<br>  <br>  I love Madelyn, it's beautiful and timeless. I prefer the spelling Madeleine though. Faith is sweet.<br>  <br>  You've given your kids some great names! James Thomas is traditional and masculine, and I like Cole too. Zoe Isabella is very pretty, and I think Isabella works really well as a middle name since it's so popular as a first name. Alexa is one of my favourite names, it's simple and elegant.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about the judgemental people -- it's your body and none of their business. It doesn't affect them in any way. Big families are lovely, I'm hoping to have one myself! Congrats on your baby :)|`|CxRJwJsraa	I love Graham Joseph!<br>  I think I'd prefer Madelyn as Madeline, but that's just me.<br>  <br>  the names fit perfectly with the other children!<br>  <br>  Congrats.<br>  <br>  <br>  oh, and PS, I'm all for big families, so long as you can love them all and support them all!|`|gu1sEQN8aa	I think you should consider this thing called condoms...geez.<br>  <br>  Edit: I dont know but two people seem to agree with me.

Here is what I think of the names you already have:<br>  <br>  James Thomas - Nice, strong name. Not a favorite, but still good. <br>  Landon Taylor - Landen is my favorite boy name, and I love it with Taylor - even though I prefer Taylor on a girl.<br>  Claire Alexa - I love Clara and Alex for girls, but this is also very pretty.<br>  Nolan Anthony - I love how these sound together. Great name.<br>  Zoe Isabella - I prefer Zoey Isabelle, but it's still a beautiful name.<br>  Cole Jeremiah - I love how these sound also. <br>  <br>  You've chosen wonderful names so far! Here are my suggestions for #7:<br>  <br>  Blake <br>  Parker<br>  Jonathan<br>  Bryce<br>  Mason<br>  Luke<br>  <br>  Avery<br>  Audrey<br>  Sophia<br>  Haley<br>  Erin<br>  Kadence "Kady"|`|yQMYiF3gaa	I like Graham Joseph, Madelyn Faith not so much. but if YOU like them, then who cares? and I like the names of your other kids, they're very nice names. :) I like the name Madelyn...or Madeline, as I like to spell it, but I love the middle name Scarlett to go with it.  just a suggestion, congratulations on the kids! :)|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	I love James.  Very classic.  Landon is okay to me.  It wasn't popular 9 years ago when you used it but it's really taken off.  Claire is my daughter's middle name and I love it.  Nolan is one of my favorite boy's names ever!  Zoe is just okay in my book.  I think it depends on the kid.  Cole is on the trendy side and I'm not sure I dig it.  I love love love Graham for a boy.  Madelyn is a great name too!|`|w7fCw6WTaa	I agree with poker face, haven't you ever heard of contraception? Some people may like big families but jeez, imagine a world where everyone just did what they wanted with no thought for the bigger picture. What if your 7 kids decide they want 7 kids each, then each of their kids wants 7 kids...|`|ZJVNUmz3aa	i think all of your names are really cute. they all have are different but flow really well together. madelyn faith is absolutely adorable, and i think its one of my new favorite names!!! graham is different but i really like that too. <br>  <br>  congratulations!!!|`|vgQBoU4Uaa	#7?

Especially Landon Taylor.<br>  And I adore Madelyn Faith, Graham Joseph is also cute.|`|dW9C6aswaa	I Love both names you have chosen! And I love every single one of your other children's names!
I64JOuMKaa	if you guys broke up 3 time in the past couple of months do you think it's really worth it ?<br>  Do you think she actually likes you ? Or does she just like the holding hands etc ?<br>  I mean, everyone has fights but most people don't break up and get back together as much as 3 times.<br>  <br>  I mean, maybe you can find someone else that makes you happier because you're not sure what you deserve thats why we all settle for less.<br>  I think you should end it with her, and if she tries to get back together I don't think you should because there's gunna be a girl that will make you SO happy and thats when you wont regret breaking up with her.<br>  <br>  I mean she made you really happy at one point, but the happyness died down , and you're just trying to find being that happy again and maybe its not with her : )<br>  <br>  If you keep getting back with her, well, there's a reason you guys broke up the first time, and well you got together because you thought you could fix it, but obviously you didn't fix it because you guys broke up 2 more times after that .<br>  <br>  I think you deserve a girl that makes you smile all the time that won't break up with you 3 times maybe even more : )<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK !|`|yOhGkcNjaa	i say you break up. why waste your time?|`|oKwXjVolaa	It sounds like she's not too sure of your relationship and herself. She may have some insecurities about having a boyfriend or people at school knowing she does. Give her time, and if she's still weird like this, confront her about it or break up with her. Either way, go with your gut feeling. If you love her, it'll all turn out for the best. And don't stress about it, you're just in early high school, you aren't making any major life decisions like marriage. Just have fun with it!|`|7810472dea4ef476f08e138148939625aa	yes break up. if you want a serious relationship..be with someone who can handle one.|`|z96l92Eiaa	Well.. I'm kind of having somewhat of the same problem, except my boyfriend and i have been going out for four months and just broke up for a week on Sunday.<br>  <br>  I don't think anyone can answer this question but yourself.<br>  You have to think, do the good times make up for the bad?<br>  <br>  Personally, i think I'm just going to follow my heart and hopefully everything will work out how its supposed to.<br>  <br>  Good luck. (:
Fd4lITkvaa	I cried a lot for maybe 4-5 weeks, the first few were the worst. If you are still having trouble by your 6wk exam that's when you should mention it unless you are having highly disturbing thoughts. If you are having thoughts of hurting yourself or your baby you should get help sooner.<br>  <br>  Sleep when your baby sleeps and do lots of skin to skin care.|`|png0sxZnaa	I definatley did.<br>  <br>  I would say it lasted 2 weeks which I know is longer than the books say it'll last.<br>  <br>  I was really down but I love my baby so much. I think it was just the hormones and my body recovering from the birth and pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I coped by talking to my husband lots and seeking reassurance from him, I also did my best to be around baby as much as possible and tried to rest when she did.|`|nrTVlo8Eaa	Definitely go see the doctor. I literally had baby blues for over 4 years and had to be put on wellbutrin and xanax.<br>  <br>  I usually have issues with PMS, or PMDD as they call it now, with something like 8 menstrual cycles out of 12, so I suppose it shouldn't be a surprise that I had baby blues, too.<br>  <br>  The guilt is what I had the most trouble with... I was doing a fine job but couldn't see anything but my failures. <br>  <br>  Hormonal problems are not your fault; it's a chemical thing.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	I actually didn't get the baby blues until 5 months afterward!  I was just a little down all the time, I was super jealous of my mother-in-law, who takes care of my baby.  I feel much better now though and as the weather gets warmer, I feel even better!<br>  <br>  You should talk to someone though, it'll make you feel better.|`|HYrs7qzBaa	I NEVER HAD THE BABY BLUES ... ANYTHING LIKE THAT ... I JUST STAYED ACTIVE AND PLAYED WITH ALL MY CHILD'S .... AND TALKED TO MY HUBBY IF I WAS UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING AND WE FIXED IT TOGETHER ...|`|0oHakDnKaa	2 -3 weeks. I remember crying all the time.  I don't really remember how I coped, I think I just slept as much as I could.|`|PArglvgKaa	Mine just started at 2 months,so we will see. I take Zoloft.
AA11624887	Talk to the baby-sitter... see what her story is, and find out why she didn't tell you.  If it sounds like neglect, then call the cops.  Regardless of whatever she says, never ever take your baby back there to be cared for again.<br>  <br>  I hope the baby really is ok.<br>  <br>  I finished this before I read your added comments.  Call the cops.  Accidents can be accidents,  but when you try to cover them up, it is now abuse.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	You can report her to CPS if you're serious about this. If not, just don't allow your baby to go over there anymore and don't talk to her again.|`|ZefydJ8Gaa	not ever let her watch ur baby again and sue her|`|cYRZpGkqaa	Tell her to come clean or you're going to press charges. How old is your son? If he's not mobile yet, chances are it wasn't an accident. But if he's young and in a climbing phase, it's possible that he fell. The way she acted, it sounds like somethings up. My prayers are with you.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Ask my friend what happened and decide to take it from there.<br>  <br>  Pressing charges seems like a likely situation.|`|NI0cNU22aa	I would kill the babysitter.<br>  <br>  Not joking, either.|`|tkSXjqhuaa	1. I wouldnt leave my son with my friend... Only his grandma.<br>  2. I would never leave my son for 2 days.|`|nTDlqdHIaa	Yeah that is when you demand to that she tells you what happened and if she doesn't then you tell her that she will be hearing from your lawyer. Ohh and if she has any children I would call CPS...it's hard to tell what has happened to them.|`|g7wQij2Oaa	whoa. call the cops. i cant believe your friend didnt tell you. she needs to get in lots of trouble.. i would be so mad. i hope everything turns out ok for your son. i'm so sorry.<br>  but really call the cops and ask them for the steps you need to take.<br>  <br>  :)|`|AUos3fzYaa	tell the cops they better get to her before i do .. then  find her beat her head and ask how it feels .. if the cops get there fist then press charges this is punishable in court and poss. could get prison.. where she would def, get dropped..|`|xoobWcWxaa	press charges if its possible|`|AA11537580	get written proff<br>  get a lawyer<br>  press charges|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	ask your friend what happened!!!|`|F12ekJ7Saa	If I had a son and this had happened to him I would be very upset and angry. I would ask what happened and how did the baby react. If she didn't say anything I would threaten her that if she does not tell me I will report her to the police.<br>  <br>  First of all I would let someone I love and trust with all my heart to babysit my baby. I would never let someone take care of my baby for two days if I had doubts about them. Secondly, I would always call just to check up on how things are. I would want to know when the baby ate, slept, and had his diaper change. I don't care if I am too demanding, this is my baby and I would never want something bad to go wrong.<br>  <br>  If this happened to you, I am very sorry and hope your little one is doing better. That was very mean of her to not tell you what happened when you went to go and pick up your son. She has the right to tell you everything that happened during those two days and you have the right to know as well. If she still doesn't talk to you, I would report her to the police anyways and then she will talk!<br>  <br>  Good luck hun and I hope that precious little angel of yours feels better very soon.|`|VgUj3rq8aa	i will ask your friend that if he fail on the floor or what happen to him if  she smelled something did he eat something we did sopposed to or what happen to him and then i will tell the dr what happened to him that is what i should do if i was you and ask her that why did she stopped talking to you what happen and that is what i should do|`|ZSADcSmJaa	ohmy god.. that would be a nightmare.. im so sorry <br>  anyway you have to confront the friend..
qqiVKUBpaa	If your mom seems a little over protective, maybe it's because she's never met your friends. You can't blame your mom for not trusting people that she has never met. These days all you have to do is turn on the t.v. and there are girls your age having sex with people that they met at the park. It's scary as a parent, and you are only 13 years old. I hope that you realize that is still very young and your mom probably loses sleep at night thinking about all of the dangerous rapists and druggies out there who could possibly hurt you if she let you go anywhere alone. Your best bet is to introduce your mom to your friends. Ask if you can have them over to your house for a sleepover or to watch a movie. If she gets to know them maybe she'll feel better about letting you go places with them, that might mean that she'll drop you off and pick you up from the movie theater herself or give you bear mace to put in your purse, but that is an improvement right? Cut her some slack though, your mom labored really hard to bring you into the world, fell in love with you from the second that you were born and worked hard for 13 years to take care of you and keep you alive. When you love someone that much and they are that important to you it's easy to over protect.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Bring your friends home to meet your mom. If they're sweet girls, your mom will see that for herself and possibly let you start doing more things with them.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	your mom is a control freak and figures she can keep you to herself and you wont grow up and have a life outside her controlling world|`|QveBSjFSaa	You're 13.<br>  Follow her rules, and show her that you can grow responsibly.<br>  I cannot accurately assess your mother's parenting skills based solely on your representation of them, but on my parenting radar, she seems to be doing a fine job.<br>  added~ you might want to let her meet your friends and their parents.|`|rBq189W1aa	Sounds like she needs to pull her head out of her butt just a tad there.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Go live in a foster home and see if you like that better.|`|3fMK5moxaa	loll.. I wish my mum was like yours then i might not of had a baby at 18. dont worry depending on were you live you should be free in 5-8 yrs. good luck.|`|hNr3GFvlaa	It is clear that you are frustrated with your mom's attitude towards your choices and friends. I can also see that you want her to re-evaluate her position.<br>  <br>  It seems that she is happy with her position, however, and that she needs to feel that you are safe and away from risky situations. <br>  <br>  What adults seem to forget (in the interest of "safety") is that children learn by having experiences and making choices and not by avoiding experiences.<br>  <br>  Maybe you can have a honest conversation with your mother and ask her if she would consider trusting you and give you the opportunity to make the choices for yourself.<br>  <br>  It may be a good idea to talk to the parents of one your peers and see if they would be open to address your mother's concerns.<br>  <br>  If you choose to speak with your mother, do it in a moment when you are not triggered by a recent event. It is a good idea to talk with her when you are both feeling calm and connected. Know that you may not get the answer you want. Try to work with your mom, not against her, and find circumstances where you can be with your friends, and she will feel good about your safety. This will likely be a process, as she will learn to trust you little by little. Keep her involved in your life and don't lie to her. She will know.
IFDfpbFJaa	It was more like a couple of weeks. Yes. It sounded like he was grinding his teeth off. I hate that sound. it grosses me out .|`|XSol0H6Uaa	I forgot my baby did this until you just brought it up.  That sound is rather disgusting, isn't it?  It lasted a couple of weeks I think.<br>  <br>  yes, like the nails on the chalk board.  shudder.|`|TOhrVaDhaa	lol I don't know why people hate that sound,I think its actually cute.But I admit it does get annoying sometimes.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Lol, I just asked about this a month or so ago. It HAS stopped with my son, probably because it's not new anymore/is boring. What I did, though, was say "Ick" and gave him something to put in his mouth(a snack or a toy). Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.<br>  <br>  But it will pass. I know how you feel, it made me cringe!
mpq95NF9aa	Yeah, sorry. Eleven-year-olds shouldn't be dating period. That will look weird. Will he be 12 while you're still 13? That might be a little better. I'd wait.<br>  <br>  If my son was 11 and brought home a 13-yr-old girl I'd kick both their a**es into the middle of next week, and so would any other mother with sense.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To answer your second question, I'd just say "Hey, I do like you a lot but I think our age difference right now might look bad and even get us in trouble. Let's just wait a while and get to know each other even better in the meantime before we make it official." He should understand. A guy said that to me before when I was 17 and he was...older. We waited until I was 18 to date and now we're married.|`|SoLSd9Lyaa	Sorry, but for me it won't look good. No offense, really, but just in my opinion, you can find other guys that are your age or a little bit older.|`|Ae0MwCPxaa	no lol..thats cute! you should go out with him! xoxo|`|7p9qgkSFaa	Well, it is a little weird considering that no matter how much an eleven year thinks they are like a thirteen year old it simply isn't true. When you are eleven you are just starting to get ready for puberty but you will start it when you are 13 or 14. That makes you in a whole different world of hormones and drama and just basically life. What is a (should be) fifth or sixth grader doing in seventh or eighth grade? He couldn't have skipped that many grades now could he? Besides, it is sweet you like him, but he shouldn't be in your social class for a reason. He is a whole world away. That is why most people start hanging out with kids two years younger when they are older, when they are alike (all raging hormones, all friends in the group are dating, they all are the same). It isn't wrong now and isn't wrong then but you may find yourself understanding in the future that in between those two years you both were born a lot happened. And also a lot will happens in your lives too. And those two years will make the difference between you guys going through the same things at the same time or not.|`|l9bNCR6maa	go for it btw i love the dalek|`|5zSAPU52aa	i think its fine.|`|h1AIzD9baa	why does it really matter what people think.. your 13 he's 11.. its not going to be a life lasting relationship any way..|`|H0sPCJQPaa	No <br>  He's in your grade it's fine.|`|7RQ6XQnPaa	11 AND 13 IS NOT A AGE OF DATING BE CALM AND CONCENTRATE ON YOUR STUDY  IT IS HUMBLY REQUESTED DATING AGE WILL COME AND YOU WILL BE GROWN UP TO THAT TIME
H2IhRXIIaa	LOL, wow. First congrats! Second I think you should sit down with them together and talk to them about it..Cause im sure being like u said her daughter is a good girl, you can continue to work for them for now..So its not like you leaving them or anything. And then when u do have the baby you can have your mom watch them which im sure they would be ok with.. But I would tellthem a bit after her birthday..maybe like 5 days or a weeks, and make sure there not stressed abt there jobs or anything, as in catch them at the right time. But I think you should be ok..|`|OU9xnW86aa	I wouldn't tell them until you are farther along, at least 9 or 10 weeks, preferably 12.<br>  <br>  You could mention it to the Wife first and then talk to them both whenever it's convenient for them.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!|`|yo9EGMSdaa	tell them when they r back from work so that they can discuss it together. if u tell them in the morning and they don't take the thing well, the whole day could be spoiled for all of you.|`|18d9aa70c53578f18caa307002ccab93aa	Tell them when the party is over. They seem like nice and genuine people. Good luck.|`|7z6BWoESaa	I think it is good that you have a plan all worked out, I would tell them that you have something you have to discuss with both of them and arrange a time, they both have free, I would ask them if it is ok for your Mother to fill in and ask them if you can then bring your baby with you, then just work out the details! congrats and good luck|`|hyp3bvhHaa	i know someone who has a nanny that fell pregnant. they decided to keep her on and after her maternity leave she brougt the baby with her to work. Given the hours you work could younot get your husband to get the baby up in the morning s and drop it a t a childminders / day care and you could pick it up after 12 as half a day wouldn't cost much?<br>  am only suggesting tat as your employers may ot mind their own baby screaming but your baby screaming and waking them at 4 in the morning may be an entirely different matter
7zMtmKJaaa	nah i'm 16 and pregnant. i'm sure its alot easier at age 18. 18 is already and adult so idkwhy ppl have a problem with that age. probably because some 18 year olds arent financially stable|`|968113aa05a0df8cafaaf258a559c4dfaa	i can tell you that people will still think of you as "a teen mother/father" simply because of you age.<br>  <br>  however, as long as you're out of high school and can support yourself and the baby, i see no problem with it. it's better than someone twice your age with no resources popping out a kid and living off the state.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|3fMK5moxaa	There's nothing wrong with it i got pregnant at 18 and had my daughter at 19, im still with her farther and have been for 6 years.<br>  but i do wished i waited, did some traveling and lived care free for abit first. but I love my daughter to bits and wouldn't change her for anything.|`|z6IekuwSaa	I say if you're married, you're good to go<br>  <br>  By the way my mom was married at age 14. I still find that amazing. She wasn't even knocked up yet. lol. That's why I think it's more about marriage than age.|`|m0xehTLqaa	no its still to young. why burden yourself with kids at such a young age?|`|53QQ9KXEaa	I can't really say much, seeing as how I'm 19 and pregnant, but I think they shouldn't PLAN a pregnancy at such an age. It's a big responsibility. My pregnancy was a surprise. I wish I could've waited until I was a bit older, but I wouldn't take it back now. I'm really excited to meet my son!<br>  <br>  I guess it depends on the individual. I say if you're financially stable, mature enough, and find yourself to be emotionally ready for it, then go ahead. Most 18 years olds are not though.|`|ng3A9Pgqaa	I don't see anything wrong with it as long as you are emotionally and financially prepared for a baby but unfortunately, most 18-year-olds aren't. At 18, you're still assumed to be an "irresponsible" teen so you will be looked down on just like someone pregnant at 16 or 17 except it's not as bad because you're 18 and legally an adult [although a lot of 18-year-olds still have the mentality of teens, which is why people say they should wait]. Most people make general assumptions that no one under age 21 is ready for parenthood or mature enough to be a parent, but there are so many teen/young parents disproving that assumption.|`|2DsgflhOaa	Well you have a point you're an adult. But that doesn't mean that you're mentally, and emotionally ready to have a baby. You're Trust me those are the years that you will look back on and regret that you never got to enjoy them. For so long I want to get married and have a baby, now that both have happened.. of course i'm happy, but a part of me really misses my college times and wishes that I could have had them a little longer. Once you get pregnant, that's it.. no turning back. If I got pregnant when I wanted to I never would have experienced the best times of my life. Now at least since I lived up most of my younger years I can kick back and look forward to the times with my husband and child.<br>  <br>  And unless if you somehow got a degree in college and are making around or over 30k a year, or at least a great paying job or someone that could support you while you're pregnant than i don't think you should be having a baby unless you want to make things hard on you and your baby and those who love you and are around you.|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	your an adult at 18. not at 16 not at 17... no problem if your an adult|`|70kh6VSoaa	it depends just cause its a legal adult does not make you a real adult and ready for a baby|`|qzY6TuQmaa	its better then 16 or 17 so no one should have a prob with you it could b worse
53QQ9KXEaa	When I had my first ultrasound I thought I was 15 weeks six days, but it turns out I was 17 weeks. My due date went from July 2 to June 24th.|`|fZCfJWpOaa	Yikes!  That's a huge difference in dates.  I would guess that the first doctor messed up big time on the date.   I don't know when you had these ultrasounds done (do you remember the days?), but for whatever week you were supposed to be, count up until 40 weeks and that should be your due date (or around it).  <br>  <br>  I'm guessing you had your 11 week ultrasound recently, and counting from last week, September 22 sounds about right.  Did the first doctor think you were further along before?|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	mine changed but only by a few days
pOZubuOcaa	Yes im turning 16 in may<br>  <br>  im just scared of growing up :|<br>  not just about turning 16<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  i don't want to grow up haha<br>  wow every else actually wants to grow up except me?|`|ud0gPY3baa	I was scared for like one hour. <br>  I was excited because it would mean that I was closer to becoming an adult, and maybe thats what scared me. I guess I didn't think I was ready. But now it's fun, because I get to drive and spend more time with my friends. ( :<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  P.s I love your username ( : lol|`|tbeO3Lataa	Kind of. I will be 16 in December. I think 16 is when it is really time to admit you are almost an adult, and that scares me. But I am also excited! You should be to!|`|NFeKUgWCaa	I turned 16 Saturday , and I don't feel any different.<br>  Although I got more privileges. :)|`|R0YkIVlpaa	what you only turn 16 once in a lifetime enjoy it before its time to star maturing|`|oGHtaaCkaa	I'm scared to turn 18.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	I'm excited<br>  Driving, Parties, CELL PHONE, jobs, sweet 16<br>  Need I say more?|`|LSkeAPBIaa	I'm 17. 16 was fun|`|JAZWe8A6aa	Yes, you can turn sixteen. It's just another year added to your life span, there's nothing to be worried about. When you turned thirteen were you scared? Does it really feel any different physically? Not really. Being sixteen really shouldn't be that scary. Sure, you're maturing and you'll be able to legally drive and everything, but you can still be the way you were when you were fifteen. Being sixteen just adds more privileges, it doesn't do much else than that generally. Don't be scared, you'll be a fine sixteen year old!|`|2DsgflhOaa	16 and 17 years were ones of the best for me. They even out did my 21st (well not the birthday part but the year itself). You'll be so excited to drive and be independent. Not sayin that every teen hates their parents, I loved and love mine but it was great to be able to get away and do something on my own. How much more of a life you'll have, to be able to get a real job and have money to do with it what you want. Don't worry its going to be great and over with before you know it.|`|xPsv7ysvaa	ok when i turned 16 my parents told me i was going to rome with 4 friends, i got a car too. now turning 16 was the best nad that is when i got my license too. damn what is your problem. more parties, driving .|`|JiF6pOYeaa	wat r u scared of itz one age closer to being grown to be free and do things when u want im glad im 16 im almost grown and i cant wait.....|`|dbf8Afhoaa	I'm turning 15 in 2 weeks, and no, I'm excited to turn 16 =)|`|mUIMF3hnaa	what?|`|PJ0aI0Dtaa	im 13.<br>  and i want to turn 16<br>  but im scared of growing up o.O|`|UdatjYEQaa	whats the problem?<br>  i wish i could be 16 again.. haha|`|zdGpaFlfaa	i turned 16 almost 4 years ago so no not really.|`|Osn1xpu6aa	naw i can't wait!|`|X67Y1BACaa	I can't wait until I'm 16!

5yAsj29Vaa	Get used to it.  While you're pregnant, you have an increase in discharge and it only gets heavier as you progress in your pregnancy.  Invest in some panty liners.<br>  If it turns yellow, green, or pink or develops a foul odor, contact your Dr.  But as long as it's milky or clear and has little to no odor, you are ok.|`|35kVNi5oaa	Some days are just wetter than others.|`|tkqV2CI5aa	I have that too actually, it is very normal during pregnancy, even more when you get further along, but if it starts to smell, ask your doctor, there could be a vaginal infection.
AA10196172	You risk getting a tear and bleeding - in about 9 months.|`|fHjSonssaa	Everyone is ready for sex at a different time frames.<br>  The biggest issue that could arise would be an infection- but if you don't have symptoms yet (pain,fever,etc...) you're probably fine.<br>  <br>  The biggest thing after infection is the comfort level.  And as you said, you were totally comfortable- You didn't have stitches- so everything sounds just fine.<br>  <br>  6 weeks is the general recommendation they give because at that time frame, EVERYONE should be healed- so easy to use that as the go ahead.<br>  <br>  For me- we waited until after the 6 week check up, but I also had stitches and PP hemoragging 10 days after I gave birth and had to have a D + C.  Plus, I was very sore and it took quite awhile to feel comfortable again- <br>  <br>  Really, you have nothing to worry about!!|`|weBvwrloaa	you risk an infection or getting pregnant again but thats about it.|`|82BSdiyCaa	Honestly, even after 2 kids I still don't know why they say that. I can tell you that my Dr said no sex for 6 weeks with the first one and with the second she said "you've done this before, when you stop bleeding you can decide when you feel ready". Not sure if this helps, but that was my experience...|`|9bPzzoIFaa	well really the only thing that may happen is you get pregnant again quickly and easily, everything up there inside is still open making it really really easy for sperm to get to your egg... my sister and i are 10 months apart and my mother swears thats why...|`|eV7rtxmuaa	I had sex also after 3 weeks of giving birth. They advise against it because the risk of infection.
gFNCIJsfaa	id say the first one. i have the same issue and i know it can be embarasing. but id say the first one|`|CFFuFof1aa	Well, it could be either. I would probably say the first one though. When was the first day of your last period??? If I knew that I could help better. Google a ovulation calendar. Enter in the first day of your last menstral cycle. It will pop up all the days that you were ovulating. See which one pops up. I bet the first one will, Dec 27. You can also google due date calculator.|`|hyp3bvhHaa	if you were  8 weeks at 27th of Feb i would almost certainly say that it was was the oter boys.<br>  <br>  When counitng pregnancy weeks Week 1 = the day of your first missed period, a woman with an average cycle would conceive on day 14 ie Week 2 so according to the scan dates you would have conceived around 16th january it is quite noral for a scan to be up to a week out so this would fit perfectly.|`|yMTqhoUraa	Jan 9th is when you conceived. You take the first day of your last menstrual cycle subtract 7 days then add nine months and you get your due date, so If i figured it out right you conceived Jan 9th. Hope I could help.|`|FyEYarmqaa	I follow the same formula. Subtract one week. Add nine months. I think it would be the Jan 9.... However the dates are awefully close... I hope everything works out. Ask God.
WWcaKZ7Qaa	If taken as directed within 72 hours (3 days) of unprotected sex, Plan B? reduces the chance of pregnancy by up to 89%. About 7 out of every 8 women who would have gotten pregnant will not get pregnant.<br>  <br>  As long as it is within the 72 hour window, that information should be accurate. Their website says it is most effective within the first 12 hours, but the stats are for the entire 72 hour time period.|`|AA12033653	The later into the 72 hours that the pill is taken the less effective it is.  So It is the most effective in the first 24 hours, then goes down from there.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|JlG8XgDvaa	Still a good chance it will work. Otherwise they wouldnt have stated 72 hours. But yeah, the effectiveness may be a bit diminished......And well by then you pretty much have no other way out.....definetely go to your local planned parent hood and have her tested. They can help you from there, regardless of your decision from there.
7z6BWoESaa	sounds like anxiety to me and not the blues, I would see my Doctor and I commend you on asking for help right away! congrats on the beautiful baby!|`|rFwGnZIJaa	I am currently being treated for postpartum depression. I was told by my doctor that you can get it a couple weeks after birth to a whole year after. I would see a doc and see what he want to do. If it is disrupting daily life certainly go in.|`|a9b3850496c6d2e026d3e06d78b32ecfaa	It can happen up to 1 year after having your baby. I would call your doctor. <br>  Good luck!|`|t0mb150gaa	It usually comes on right after the baby but all women are different. It could be the baby blues or just the stresses of having a newborn baby and being a new mother. I would talk to your doctor if you are concerned about it.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	This happened to me and I called my doctor to ask.  Even 7, 8, 9 months after having a baby, your hormones are messed up.  I would call your doctor though, just to find out what you can do.  You want to take whatever help you can in feeling better.
bXRuC1ASaa	I usually watch some TV with my hubby, and then he'll play XBox and I will come on here.  Once in awhile I'll take a relaxing bath..which I might go do now since John went over to his dad's to put in flooring. Thanks, I wouldn't have thought of that if I didn't see your Q! lol|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Come on here lol! Or sometimes I nap with her.|`|M5E3mDBJaa	I collapse into bed (sometimes still fully clothed) and try to catch as much sleep as I can before the baby wakes up demanding to be fed again.|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	When it's down for the night, I put everything away (toys, bottles, trash) and straighten up around the living room and play area. If I have enough energy, I will do the dishes and clean up the kitchen. On a day where I haven't finished folding, I'll do that. Then, I will finally sit on the couch and relax by getting on here and/or watching tv and waiting for my husband to get home from work. It's hard for me to relax with a mess, so I pretty much always clean up first.|`|rFtKFp03aa	Take a hot bath.. hang out with my hubby and have us time.. then go to bed, read, catch up on a show and have me time.. my husband goes to bed late and rises early.. so Its nice to get to hang with him then go up to our room alone before bed..|`|OwLcbnTvaa	I usually watch t.v, make myself dinner, have a shower, listen to music but not to loud lol.<br>  And if im lucky take the dog for a walk, while my bf is at home.|`|DNygQdmVaa	watch a movie, but usually on here lol|`|irGE84Qdaa	i cant be relax until my husband is home cu zi have a 2 week old and a 4 year old and its hard to taking care of both while 2 weeks old sleeps i have to watch 4 years old 1 to make sure that he is not doing anything which can cuz us or a baby trouble but i use pc while she is sleeping or awake no matter she is still with me when my husband gets home i feel good he can take care of my baby girl and i can do whatever i want take shower or watch tv or anything or sleep i have no good sleep that's why i make myself tired as much as i can so i sleep rite away with my baby.this is what i do.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	After my LO is in bed, here is my routine:<br>  <br>  Check Myspace<br>  <br>  Check Email<br>  <br>  Pick up Livingroom/Toys<br>  <br>  Sometimes start Dishwasher/Washing Machine<br>  <br>  Yahoo Answers<br>  <br>  Bath<br>  <br>  Bed<br>  <br>  I usually kick mysef because I REALLY should be doing more housework, but after chasing after a 16 month all day im wore to the core! :)|`|5rdiZvYEaa	Hmm.

DmN5gHMaaa	I am also 27wks and my periods were irregular.

Hopefully it isn't ask your doctor.|`|aDJSizwqaa	i went to this web site and typed in your due date and it said september 18th was your date of conception. sorry hun.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dateoflife.com/prod03.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dateoflife.com/prod03.htm</a>|`|EsXe7S1oaa	your conception date is 14 days after your last period give or take a few days...|`|fZCfJWpOaa	If you've had irregular periods then a conception calender is not going to be very accurate for you, but I tried anyway.  Here's the site I used:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pregnancy.about.com/cs/pregnancycalendar/l/blpregcalc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.about.com/cs/pregnancyc...</a><br>  <br>  In order to get June 11 as your due date, your period would have happened around September 4, 2008.  If you ovulated normally, your ovulation and conception date would be around September 18, 2008.<br>  <br>  There is a very, very, very good chance this baby is your ex's.  I'm sorry, I know that's not what you want to hear.  Please, do the right thing and admit it to your partner.  If you were in his shoes, you'd want the truth.  Also, with the baby's blood type it may become obvious that he's not the father.  It is better to tell him the truth now than him finding out the hard way.<br>  <br>  And who knows?  Your partner may be the father, but with the dates you just gave I would say it is more likely that your ex is.  Please tell him what happened and get a paternity test when the baby is born.<br>  <br>  ***********************Add************...<br>  The way to count the weeks in pregnancy is a little confusing.  The counting starts on the first day of your last period.  Since you don't ovulate for about 14 days after that point, women are not pregnant for weeks 1 and 2 of their 40 weeks of pregnancy.  Usually conception happens around week 2-3 of the pregnancy, which is why we're all saying that it's possible the baby is your ex's.|`|an8O7r4kaa	your due date shows that you were already pregnant. stop freaking out !|`|c5AJGcYcaa	Okay if you are 27 weeks pregnant then that is actually from you last menstril period. Which means the fetus age is only 25 weeks. (confusing I know lol)<br>  If you are due on the 11th, then there is a good possibility that your partner is the father.<br>  (and just because you 'mistake' didn't fully ejaculate in you doesn't mean he didn't pre-***.)<br>  <br>  it's confusing i know but have you thought about telling your partner just incase?|`|f2JjoaxVaa	well i hate to worry you even more but here is a website to go to <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bubhub.com.au/infopregnancyduedatecalculator.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.bubhub.com.au/infopregnancydu...</a><br>  <br>  when i put in your due date you conception date was 18th september 08 but im no expert. go to the site and it should give you a pretty accurate answer also you could ask your doctor they might be able to help you out. <br>  <br>  i hope its the answer you want. <br>  <br>  good luck hunny.|`|TxYcs9H9aa	I don't want to scare you, but my due date is May 25, so you are about 2 and a half weeks behind me and I know that I conceived around August 31, so there is a good chance that you conceived on September 19th.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I hate to say it too but like most people have said your date of conception was probably close to the 19th.

zGWg9RAiaa	You'll be fine!  It doesn't sound like you took too much.  Here's a website that may ease your fears.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ask.com/bar?q=ibuprofen+when+pregnant&page=1&qsrc=2105&zoom=Can+I+Take+Ibuprofen+When+Pregnant%7CCan+I+Take+Ibuprofen+While+I+Am+Pregnant%7CCan+Pregnant+Women+Take+Ibuprofen&ab=0&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.babyminestore.com%2FinfoTakingIbuprofen.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ask.com/bar?q=ibuprofen+when+...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Here's some info from the site.<br>  <br>  Medication is a concern to most expecting moms and for good reason. Some medications can cause serious problems to an unborn child while others have no known effects. For this reason, it is best to discuss all medications with your doctor before taking them.<br>  <br>  Most doctors agree that acetaminophen, or Tylenol, is the best choice of pain reliever for pregnant women. While ibuprofen is not known to cause problems during the first and second trimesters, it is unsafe for women to take during the last three months of pregnancy. It has been shown to cause problems for unborn babies that late in development. <br>  <br>  While pregnant, try to stick with Tylenol as your pain reliever. But if it doesn’t cure your aches and pains, it is probably okay to take ibuprofen as long as you are not in the third trimester of pregnancy.|`|lnp5yy3maa	Don't worry about it - there are women who accidentally get drunk before they find out they are pregnant and end up with okay babies. (not saying you should drink of course). <br>  <br>  Now that you know you are pregnant just run all your meds by your OB first. You'll be fine. Congrats on your pregnancy!|`|53QQ9KXEaa	I'm pretty sure you're going to be just fine... There's so many people that take things and what not before they find out they're expecting and have babies that turn out perfectly fine!

As long as you are no longer taking them, its fine.  Tylenol is fine, but ibuprofen(Advil) or asprin are harmful.  But 3 pills really early on won't be anything to worry about.  Congrats!|`|i7vCTOnaaa	you're probably ok. just don't take ibuprofen at all again! if you must then only take tylenol or straight "acetaminophen"

As far as cheap solutions go – I would recommend a natural haemorrhoid cure because you can use these from your own home and they are not expensive like creams etc. I have provided a link to a review of one product called H Miracle which costs around $35 but has been receiving fantastic reviews – I personally know pregnant women who have used H Miracle to cure their hemorrhoids!<br>  <br>  If this is not for you, some of the following tricks might help you out:<br>  <br>  Apply a small amount of vinegar to the hemorrhoid. This will help relieve any itching and bring down the swelling.<br>  <br>  Another way to minimize pain and swelling is to apply Aloe Vera gel to the hemorrhoid.<br>  <br>  These two tips won’t totally cure hemorrhoids in most cases but they may make them much more bearable!<br>  <br>  Check out the links below for more information about affordable home hemorrhoid cures.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  <br>  Heather-Jane|`|rBPi6N2daa	when you go in labor and after the baby my hospital had me put hemmeroid wipes on my pad and it made my stitches not hurt or anything.  i am 36 weeks and i have severe hem. now and i got some medication creme from the doctor but it really isnt helping. i am going to get some of those wipes and stick it on my undies for a couple days (change them out every couple hrs) and i bet that will make things 100% better. you can get them at walgreens.|`|HSa041M0aa	Sitz bath...you can buy one---its sort of like a bedpan or just sit in enough warm water to cover the bottom..add 1 or 2 cups of Epsom Salt...do this at least three times a week.|`|hNIof0lbaa	def buy preperation h wipes & they have cream as well! not sure about baby oil though........|`|XSW8i7rZaa	There are also natural ways to cure hemorrhoids, some of which take only 48 hours.

She can't legally enter your house or whatever, because that's trespassing. Also remember to tell your other family members, so they don't answer the door or something and then call for you. But seriously, you don't have to allow her to 'visit' you all the time, you can easily make up an excuse and then she should just leave you alone. <br>  <br>  Or you could just be straight up about it, and say please stop randomly visiting me because it's beginning to annoy me.

d5fd9d057a20f9f41b37d39a5288a98faa	When I went in at 12 weeks which was my first appt. they used the doppler to hear the baby's hearbeat... they may do this at every appt from now on. Trust me soon you will start to feel pregnant, dont worry it will hit you at some point!  =)<br>  <br>  I first heard my baby's heartbeat at 9 weeks, so the person who said closer to 20 weeks is wrong, it's much earlier then that|`|bGRexKPyaa	The least you should get to hear the heart beat, But at my 12th week apointment I got to see my baby!!!! Very very small! But your going to be amazed and smile that you can see your baby:]]|`|hZLkzuuiaa	I think it's usually closer to 20 weeks when you get to hear the heartbeat, but it really just depends on your pregnancy. They may do another ultrasound - but since you just had one, they might not see it as neccessary. Most of your appointments from here til you're about 7 - 8 months along will just be a quick visit - checking your blood pressure, measuring your stomach, listening to the heart, and making sure you are not having any unusual side effects or complications. <br>  Congratulations!

Then my water broke prematurely and it was moot.  I am under the impression that if the ultrasound is ordered by the doctor for a medical reason, it's covered.  I was over 35, however, and my insurance covered some "extra" things because of my "advanced maternal age." ;)|`|AA10624857	I didn't have any ultrasounds with my older 3. They were born back in the day when there was no such thing as a routine ultrasound. However, our 4th baby was unexpectedly conceived when I was reliably taking birth control pills for 11 years. I also developed Gestational Diabetes. Because I was of advanced maternal age (38) and had Gestational Diabetes I ended up with 12 total ultrasounds. Our insurance covered each one as well as the 10 non-stress tests I had.

But I am paranoid.<br>  <br>  My midwife told me it's okay to travel up until full term (37 weeks).  I am having a homebirth, so at that point I'd want to be home so I wouldn't have to deliver in an unfamiliar hospital.  She said to be sure to stay hydrated.  She also said to be sure to stretch my legs and walk around regularly, and that if I stayed hydrated it would help with that because I'd have to keep stopping for restroom breaks  :-)  My concern would be that the bus might not stop often enough.  Don't they usually have bathrooms on those buses?  I'd call and ask how often they usually stop.  I found an article on babycenter about this and put it in the sources.<br>  <br>  I hope you can find someone to drive with you.

Kbz8XEf9aa	Ive tried a bunch of different kinds... I will share the ones i know and my personal experience<br>  <br>  Depro- injection every few months<br>  Pros= You dont have to remember to take it, one shot lasts a few months, Its very effective<br>  Cons=It made me gain tons of weight and if you have really bad side effects you cant just stop taking it...you have to wait untill it wears off..o and its an injection. so if you hate needles..opt out of this one<br>  <br>  The pill<br>  Pros= if you have bad side effects you just stop taking it, convenient, easy to use (pills are so small) effective<br>  cons= remebering to take them everyday (im the worst for that)<br>  <br>  Nuva ring<br>  Pros= put it in once and leave it for a month... no worrying about taking the pill everyday. Its actually very comfortbale and you cant tell your wearing it. my bf says he cant feel it during sex either.<br>  <br>  Cons= takes time to get used to inserting it (not hard) lol<br>  <br>  I LOVE the nuvaring..its not that common yet cuz ppl dont know or understand it, but it works great and its easy www.nuvaring.com<br>  <br>  good luck|`|AA11348933	I was on Ortho Novum 1/35 for 8 years.  I liked it okay.  I had shorter, lighter periods and clear skin the whole time I was on it.<br>  <br>  Then I tried The patch for a year.  I hated Hated HATED it.  It made my periods longer, made my breasts hurt worse than they ever did while pregnant.  It also ate holes in my skin that would take weeks to heal.  So at any given time I had 3 or 4 patch sized sores all over my body.  Two years after I stopped taking it I got a notice from the manufacturer saying "By the way, by taking our product you are now at a higher risk for stroke"  They never mentioned that when I was taking it.  All the information at the time said it had the same amount of hormones as BC pills.  They lied.<br>  <br>  Then we had a planned pregnancy.  <br>  <br>  After our first baby was born I went on the mini-pill because I was breastfeeding.  It was annoying to have to take the pill at the same time every day and I never got a period while on it.  Oh, and my sex drive was almost nil while on it.  I got pregnant exactly two years after having my oldest while on the mini-pill.  Before I had a period.  I miscarried that one.  <br>  <br>  Three months later I got pregnant again.  We weren't actively using birth control but weren't actively planning.  <br>  <br>  After my second child I got the Paraguard IUD because my last two experiences with hormonal birth control did not go well. Its nice that I don't have to worry about anything with it, but my cervical discharge is very frequent.  I told my gyno about it and she said sometimes that happens with the Paraguard.|`|dRKGXQmeaa	I love the patch. The combination pill makes me super cranky and almost constantly PMS. Also I'm terrible at doing the 'same time every day' thing, and the patch was just natural and easy to me. I've never tried an IUD because the idea of it is a little frightening to me, and I wouldn't want something foreign floating around inside my body (yes, I am aware of how ignorant this sounds, but I can't curb my irrational fear. Sorry) I've never tried the shot either because I've heard some bad stories about it, and everyone I've seen use it has had a hefty weight gain along with it.<br>  The only, and I mean ONLY problem I encountered with the patch was sometimes at the very end of the week, the edge might peel a little. But as long as you scrub the area you're going to apply it to well in the days prior to changing (so that dead skin isn't trying to fall off) it doesn't peel at all. Some people don't like it because when they're intimate with their spouse it's like having a 'sticker' on you, but that never bothered me. I always just stuck it on a hip and ignored it for the week.<br>  Right now I'm on the mini pill because I'm breastfeeding but once I'm done it will be back to my beloved patch again.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	i love love love nuvaring. i hated taking a daily pill all the time and the IUD is too long term for me, i want another baby soon-ish...<br>  nuvaring is AWESOME! i cannot say enough good things, i feel like i can function again!<br>  <br>  i also tried the patch for awhile, hated it... it slides around and leaves u sticky. and the depo shot once, hated that too. the pills i have been on are try-cyclen and alesse... the only thing i didnt like about those was taking a pill every day...|`|nZPGdcKJaa	I was on the depo shot for 3 yrs and that was great<br>  now I have the IUD and that has been great!<br>  <br>  I am a procrastinator and something like the pill would be impossible and the ring or patch are just not long enough to not have to worry about birth control|`|I7Sd9qd6aa	NuvaRing, I have tried may pills, and the IUD Mirena and hate all of them, I always feel like crap, get migraines, ovarian cysts, and no sex drive.

It was quick and painless to insert and it is good for 5 years.|`|QvQmeUKhaa	I've tried tri-cyclen, yaz and the best one I've tried is alesse.  It doesn't make you gain weight and I had absolutely no mood swings, bloating, cramping whatsoever with it.

He said it was fine. if it got really bad he said to go back and see him. its the ligaments stretching from your uterus growing and the muscles all change because of hormones. i also get clicking in my hips lol. the twinges in your vaginal area are probably just from the bub growing too. R u showing yet, if your not you should soon cos i popped when i started to feel uncomfortable down there.<br>  <br>  I would not worry, but as always go back to your doc if you feel something is wrong|`|75c4fd1f4d2f05c3f64c60714f6b13d8aa	Sounds like your body is just adjusting to the whole idea of being pregnant.

2ObqoJbKaa	Oh, thats a cute idea. I think that I might start doing a journal of my pregnancy too. That sounds like alot of fun. I would probably include info about how Im feeling each week, how big my belly is getting, and I may draw some pictures too. congradulations, and good luck with your pregnancy!|`|65f9bf63277a3aad10cb477ed6f41708aa	Hi!

This sounds like a better idea. I am due September 16!!
EcO3uYoraa	I am also on progesterone and have to start taking it right after I ovulate.  Lets say your OPK surges on Monday.  You should start taking prometrium on Thursday morning.  My Doctor said to start it 3 days after Ovulation because you do not want to accidently take it while you are still ovulating.  It could take 36 hours to ovulate from time OPK surges, then egg can live for 24 hours.  I did it first month and got pregnant but then had miscarriage at 5 weeks due to chromosomal defects.  Any other questions, you can e-mail me!  <br>  <br>  I do the two line OPK to see the gradual build up everyday of the lines getting darker.  Then when they do get darker  I urinate in a cup and also use the happy face one just to make sure.  Baby dust!!!
5p0AW33jaa	that could just be your period starting vvery very light this time... wait for a couple of days more and if the spotting stops or doesn't get heavier, then take a test to find out what's going on. good luck!
9hrJfhIIaa	The concern is the listeria bacteria which can cause fetal meningitis. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/isitsafe/" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanpregnancy.org/isitsaf...</a><br>  <br>  Honestly, I think everything in moderation is fine... I know I'm not microwaving a sandwich until the lunch meat is steaming to call it "safe". Weird stuff we do... lol. Just think of our mothers and grandmothers... and what they ate... everything in moderation.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	you can have anything in moderation. they worry about things like lunch meat because of the nitrates that are in it. blue cheese because it is made from mold. tuna because of mercury.|`|HYveAhbUaa	I know the problem with DELI meat is that pregnant women are more prone to the food poisoning that can be in them and that if you do eat them you should reheat first.  I think blue cheese has something to do with the lack of processing, and the rest I haven't heard either.  I think it is blown out of proportion, but I still avoid some of them just in case.|`|g7wQij2Oaa	I'm sure small amounts of the meats would be fine, but stay away from blue cheese and feta.<br>  i don't eat any of those because i am vegan, but i'm so concerned about the health of my babies that i don't think i would anyway.<br>  and another one to add to your list: sprouts. not brussel sprouts, the other kind.<br>  <br>  :)|`|pIBOSkfsaa	this is such a load of crap.  eat what ever you want, if you limit your self to just plain old veggies and fruit you'll have one hell of a lousy pregnancy. Its okay to eat anything in moderation.<br>  <br>  The reason they say only to eat sea food once a week is because of the high content of mercury in fish , which can be harmful to the baby. How ever it has also been said that even while not pregnant limit yourself to seafood twice a week (depending on age and weight)<br>  <br>  And as far as cheeses and lunch meats, They are edible during pregnancy you just have to make sure all meats are cooked thoroughly (even lunch meat should be thrown in the micromave for a minute before making a sandwich) this is because Listeriosis bacteria can be on meat, which can make anyone pretty sick , but is definitely a hazard for pregnant women and the elderly. All meat is fine so long as its cooked well.<br>  <br>  Cheeses are also okay to eat , as long as they are pasterized, most are but blue cheese isn't, but i can't see a pregnant woman wanting to even be in the same room as blue cheese.
AA11828121	You're probably pregnant :) It sounds like implantation bleeding..And yes I did..I spotted on the 14th and 15th of Nov. and my period didn't come on the 20th when it was supposed to, I was also peeing a lot so I kinda knew..|`|2DsgflhOaa	I had the cramping for the first month but never did any sort of bleeding, except once with old blood but that was practically nothing. You should get a positive pregnancy test by now, go buy one or go to the doctor.

I went to the doctor and told him that I couldn't even walk or sit for a long period of time. He said to put a heating pad. I told him, that I've read that it wasn't right to do so. He said to go ahead and use it. So, I would ask your doctor. Hope you feel better.|`|98WKYtfwaa	Heating pads are fine, i got given a loan of one from my pregnancy chiropractor, my midwife gave the thumbs up for this and it's electric (to the user who said electric isn't allowed).<br>  <br>  I use mines everytime i get a sore aching back.

DHwPgw9iaa	There's an actor named Jonathan Rhys Meyers. His second name is pronounced REESE. Anyone who doesn't know that obviously thinks that the American way to spell is the only way to spell, and thus lacks culture.<br>  <br>  Sorry, just my opinion. You're correct to spell it Rhys!<br>  <br>  I kind of like the sound of Dylan Rhys better. Dylan is adorable. Tess Rhian is beautiful. These names sound Gaelic... Are you Irish?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ozATw7s0aa	Please don't do Rhys.<br>  <br>  Reese is better...<br>  <br>  <br>  Tess is cute.|`|qrd27oqsaa	Yes they're great.

dRKGXQmeaa	Sometimes (VERY rarely) the milk just doesn't come in, or for whatever reason will stop flowing. Some women with chronic medical conditions will need to take medication that are unsafe for babies and can pass through the milk and do harm to their children. If they don't take their medication they could do great harm to themselves, so in those kinds of cases formula feeding is a much better option. Some babies are born with deformities of the face/mouth as well that makes breastfeeding difficult or impossible and they need special feeding equipment.<br>  I think the most common cause is usually medication the mother needs to be taking that would put her child at risk if they were to get it through the breast milk. Just answering why people can't - are actually incapable of it - not why they would choose not to. Sometimes inverted nipples or problems with latch (bleeding nipples etc) will discourage moms from continuing to try, though. I know I had a hell of a time with bleeding and bruising at first.|`|Kbz8XEf9aa	Pain (nipples or breasts)<br>  Babe unable to latch<br>  Milk not coming in<br>  Mom being on certain drugs/medications<br>  cultural reasons- many asian cultures believe that the colostrum (first milk) is not sufficient or good so they bottlefeed untill milk comes in. The colostrum is actually very sufficient and all the babe needs.<br>  Personal choice- just dont feel like breastfeeding (its hard work) and some ppl are not up for the challenge.|`|z6IekuwSaa	My daughter was born tongue tied. Our insurance claim was denied and we could not afford the procedure. If I was not a SAHM I would not be able to breastfeed b/c I need to pump all through the day. Some people don't have the luxury I do with the time and means for exclusive pumping. Also some mothers are on medications that would harm the baby.|`|Ug5twRBDaa	Sometimes the milk doesn't come in, or not in enough quantities...in my case, I was taking medication that would be excreted in breast milk. So I was not allowed to.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	I was on blood thinners and not allowed to for a few days.  By the time I was able, my daughter wouldn't take the breast so I pumped for 8 weeks.|`|ROJans2Taa	my personal experience bad latch with in turn hurt my supply (then in which I pumped for awhile), others choose not to, some find it to demanding, or working and pumping isn't an option (due to personal choice or other)|`|MkZF3pqXaa	I became worn down and dehydrated after my second child was born. He was also ill and in the hospital for a couple of days and I couldn't be there all the time to feed him.  When his dad was there, he got the bottle- so he chose that. My supply literally shut itself off as my body conserved all it's resources for my needs.<br>  <br>  My oldest child just didn't care for it.  She preferred the bottle- so I pumped and fed her that way.<br>  <br>  With my third, I chose to pump and bottle feed her due to convenience.<br>  <br>  Bottles are easier for the babies themselves since it takes alot less work for them to get the milk.  Yes, we parents promote laziness from birth now...haha|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Well that depends on what you define breastfeed as.  Some people define breastfeeding as suckling at the breast with or without milk transfer.  So even with no milk a mom could be said to breastfeed.  Some things can prevent mom from having a full milk supply, but even then she could nurse part time.<br>  <br>  Moms who shouldn't nurse even if they have milk:<br>  <br>  Mom's with uncontrolled substance abuse problems (of course what that mom would be doing taking care of a baby is beyond me).<br>  <br>  Mom's that have active, untreated TB infections can pump milk but are generally told not to nurse directly, or hold their babies much really.<br>  <br>  Mom's taking the following medications:<br>  *Most chemotherapy drugs<br>  (this list is not complete)<br>  <br>  Its commonly thought that HIV positive mothers shouldn't breastfeed.  However recent studies suggest that in places where water is unsafe, fuel is in short supply, and medical care is hard to obtain EXCLUSIVE breastfeeding is safer than formula.  In places where formula is less unsafe its up for debate but in all cases the decision must be left to the individual mother (after she has been informed of the risks and benefits.  However the baby must be exclusively breastfed, breastfeeding with formula, solids, teas, juice etc is unsafe.<br>  <br>  <br>  Drugs that may prevent breastfeeding, but not always so mom can nurse as long as baby is carefully monitored, but if the mom is one that secrets higher levels into their milk then it would preclude nursing unless mom can get stop or take a different drug:<br>  *Antineoplastics<br>  *Phenobarbital, ethosuximide, primidone <br>  *Amiodarone <br>  *lithium <br>  (this list is not complete)<br>  <br>  Drugs that can reduce milk production, so while not unsafe may prevent fully breastfeeding:<br>  *Ergonovine <br>  *Bromocriptine <br>  *Estrogens  (and rarely progesterone)<br>  (this list is NOT complete)<br>  ==================<br>  <br>  Things that prevent or reduce milk production<br>  ------------------------<br>  <br>  Some women have breast abnormalities like tubular breasts which do not have any milk ducts.<br>  <br>  Women that have had a double mastectomy.  But most women can nurse successfully with only one breast.<br>  <br>  Women that have had radiation treatment for breast cancer may not make milk in the treated breast, so if both were treated she may not make any milk.<br>  <br>  Certain kinds of nipple surgery very rarely leave the woman without any ability to make milk.  Generally women that have had augmentation, reduction, or nipple surgeries can at least nurse somewhat.<br>  <br>  PCOS can prevent the milk making system from developing during puberty and again cause it not to develop during pregnancy.  There are treatments that can help during puberty and pregnancy but if not treated I don't believe there is treatment.<br>  <br>  Uncontrolled diabetes, anemia, and hypothyroidism -but then why wouldn't you treat it?<br>  <br>  ==========<br>  Other:<br>  <br>  Some victims of child abuse or rape can't nurse, some do great and find it empowering, some can do ok with therapy, for some its just not worth the emotional problems<br>  <br>  Moms with undiagnosed D-MER understandably sometimes wean.|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	A lot of moms have trouble producing a good milk supply.  Yes, if the mom worked at it a little longer, their milk supply could have been better, but it's hard to watch a newborn crying because they are hungry.  It's only human to want to make sure your baby is properly nourished.  <br>  <br>  I don't think it's wrong for a mom to supplement with formula when they see their child is hungry.  Not at all.  It could take weeks to get a good milk supply.  What is the child supposed to do in the meanwhile?  <br>  <br>  "Well, you should cluster feed/nurse around the clock, to encourage your breasts to produce milk."  Easier said than done (see the following paragraph for more detail).<br>  <br>  On the same token, it doesn't make a mom better because she stuck with the breastfeeding longer than another mom.  Some moms have more support than others.  Not everyone has the luxury of having family members helping out with food, laundry, housework, etc after the birth of the baby.  Some moms have others kids at home to attend to.  Some had difficult labor, and they are doing all they can to recover.  <br>  <br>  I get upset when I see a woman berated because she didn't "try hard enough" to breastfeed.  Unless we've been in that woman's shoes, we have NO RIGHT to judge.  <br>  <br>  Breastfeeding is not some sort of competition, to see who endured the longest.  It's SUPPOSED to be about nourishing a baby.  It's unfortunate that it's become something totally different.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Meghan:  My daughter is not lazy because she uses a bottle.  Maybe your kids are/were, but my baby isn't.|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	Women take medications that are harmful to the baby if passed though the breastmilk.<br>  <br>  Some babies are not tolerant of their own mothers milk (yes, it happens)<br>  <br>  OR..my favorite, Some women, like myself, do not have breasts, as a results of a double mastectomy.<br>  <br>  If anyone knows how to breastfeed, without breasts, PLEASE share your secret with me!|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Some just don't fancy it.I stopped after one month because it was too incontinent for me.Pumping and supplementing was more simpler (for me)<br>  <br>  Some cannot because of breast surgery...some develop infections...some never lactate..some have a poor latch and lose supply...some take medications that are not suitable for pregnant/nursing mommies etc.
65yN4aSJaa	yes, you can. i took 3 tests during 3 weeks and it didnt show up until the 3rd. it dont happen often but it can.|`|35kVNi5oaa	well, what did the test say?|`|cGLVEhXaaa	yes  you could still be pregnant. Pregnancy tests are very capable of being wrong. Think about the time frame you had sex. if you had it 3-5 days before or after your period get tested again because those are the days women ovulate and you are at high risk of getting pregnant so double check just to be safe.

You'll know that he is capable of holding it in when he goes longer periods without peeing, and starts indicating to you when he is peeing or pooping or before he pees or poops.<br>  <br>  Because you know what time of the day he will poop, you can certainly start sitting him on the potty and applauding him when he poops in the potty. That doesn't mean he is fully potty trainable right now, but its good to get a head start. Back in the day most babies were completely potty trained by 18 months or sooner so there's no reason why you shouldn't try now!|`|WT56iKwZaa	you could start putting him on the potty at the same time each day. It wouldn't hurt him and would save you a poopy diaper. It may be more of a case of training mom then training him but who cares.<br>  <br>  Im sure I don't need to say this but will anyway, make it fun for him, don't force it if it dosen't work at first, just go back a few weeks later and try it again. And deffinatly don't punish him.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Lol, no. We had a week or so where Noah would go while eating dinner. Now it's back to random times a couple of times a day.<br>  <br>  I don't know if I'd start toilet training at such a young age. Most boys aren't ready until 2 1/2-3 years in age. Can your son walk yet? He has to have a way to get into the bathroom. For now just be thankful he's so predictable, but also enjoy him being a baby.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Wow, if my son did that I would have started cloth diapering months ago.  Lucky lady!|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I can always count on a poo with in an hour of him waking up but not a specific time. The rest of the daily poo's are a crap-shoot. LOL! No pun intended. =)<br>  <br>  I think potty training is still a bit early. I think of my son who is the size of an average 1 1/2 year old and I wouldn't dream of sticking him on the potty yet.|`|QvQmeUKhaa	I think that is one thing that is usually a hit and miss for most parents but if you already know when he's most likely to have a bowel movement then I say "go for it" and the best of luck to you.  I think it will be easier for your son to get the hang of telling you he needs to poo or attempt going on his own.  My son is exactly the same...I can pretty much guarantee that once he wakes up in the morning and has his bottle...about 20 minutes to half an hour later...there's mr. poo!!! LOL!!  I'm going to try doing this when he's about 8 or 9 months old.  He's only 5 months right now.|`|OwLcbnTvaa	Wow walking at 10 months that is quite an achievement! lol.<br>  I think 10 months is a bit early for toilet training just yet.<br>  You should wait like a few more weeks to see if hes pooing at the same time still.<br>  But earlier toilet training the better!|`|W8UZebRWaa	My son splits his up. We have 3 massive ones in the morning at the sametime. <br>  I've heard if you potty train this early they will relapse.
AA11724307	There is no exact answer for this and its not a reliable source for pregnancy.  For some women, their cervix rises even before they find out they are pregnant.  For others it takes awhile after the pregnancy is confirmed to happen.  I'm going on 7 weeks and my cervix is still low....soft, but low and the doctors said it was fine.  For others, their cervix rises and they still get a period.  IF you think you could be pregnant test...its the only way to know for sure.  good luck|`|53QQ9KXEaa	It doesn't really feel any different...
MHNFnBzgaa	When conducting a self-exam, begin by washing your hands thoroughly and check your nails, they should be short and lacking in jagged edges. Examine your cervical position at the same time every day, starting the day after your period is over. Squat down, bending your knees and gently insert one or two fingers into your vagina. You should be able to feel your cervix. During the examination, observe the following:<br>  <br>  <br>  Is the cervical position easy to reach? <br>  Does the cervix feel soft or firm? <br>  Does the entrance of the cervix feel open or closed? <br>  Is the cervix dry, moist or very wet? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  During the first half of your menstrual cycle, the cervix is normally low (easy to reach) and feels firm, like the tip of your nose. It feels dry and the opening to the uterus remains closed.<br>  <br>  The cervix now rises up to the top of the vagina, is opening up and is very wet with cervical mucus. All of this is happening in order to create a more fertile environment for the sperm. The cervix feels and softer and is very sensitive to the touch as well. At the height of ovulation, the cervix may be difficult to reach, when it has risen so high that the fingers cannot touch it. <br>  <br>  <br>  Within a few days after ovulation, the entrance begins to close and the cervix returns to a firmer state. The cervical position will be lower and easier to reach.|`|MkKvGdxKaa	A medical professional on internal exam can detect pregnancy after 7-8 weeks. It happens accidentally though, say during a smear etc. The cervix will be softer and slighlty longer,  and there may on sight be the obvious presence of a muscus plug when pregnancy is advanced. it's not used as a way to detect pregnancy. A urine or blood test is the only way. <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|weBOR9YCaa	From what I was told, if you are pregnant the cervix will be really high and soft, but that isn't always the case.|`|OMTSqrSFaa	just take a test this is the only way you would no !!!!!!!!!!|`|WdvLcYaVaa	Well, unfortunately you really can not go by that. Cervical changes are not really obvious in pregnancy until towards the end of the first trimester. Unfortunately all you can do is wait and take a test.|`|7be554591e8c040c7b5bfa762a5a2560aa	Just take the test Louise....you have been asking about pregnancy for wks now.  Take the test  and you will have no question....yes or no.
kRaVa0Wraa	well no sh!t youre tired, you get less than an hour of sleep a day.<br>  <br>  how about...actually going to sleep at NIGHT like a normal person? like 11 pm|`|pcjOQDymaa	NO DUH!<br>  wow ok try going to sleep at 10 A.M and then youll get enough rest.<br>  YOU NEED TO SLEEP!|`|FhlmiI7daa	you should make sure that you get to bed by 11:00 every night, when your alarm goes off get up and stretch for a few minutes to get yourself to wake up, then get ready and have something to eat for breakfast then get to school.  I think that the biggest thing sould be to get enough hours of sleep and to give yourselh more time in the morning.|`|I64JOuMKaa	WHOA REALLY?!<br>  <br>  the longest I could go until I fell asleep would be like<br>  3ish .<br>  <br>  I suggest going to bed at 11 ! like me ! same age, but I mean you could go to bed at 12 if you wanted but the earlier the better.<br>  <br>  Turn the computer off so you're not distracted by 10:30 and get ready for bed.<br>  <br>  Wake up at 6:30 so you have time to eat breakfast, change, get dressed brush teeth etc :)<br>  <br>  GOODLUCK!|`|AusPef8Yaa	You only get 50 minutes of sleep! Try going to sleep at 10:30 or 11 and then you'll be feeling better! Did you now you can die from not getting enough sleep?|`|DJpS9GDxaa	go to sleep earlier...duh, lol<br>  you can't get by on 50 minutes of sleep!<br>  you need at least 9 hours<br>  <br>  :)|`|ZOvJLl5eaa	well if u look at ur question details im sure you can answer it yourself. GO TO BED AT AROUND 9:30 -10:00 wake up at 6 6 that way you have time to eat,get dressed etc no wonder your always tired. Please make that an effort.|`|gVMWVvlfaa	sleep|`|7810472dea4ef476f08e138148939625aa	go to bed early...like around 9 or 10. wake up at 6 eat a good meal and then off to school you go!
SxPhldhhaa	Oh, how fun! (: To make it easier, I'll just have the same number of girls and boys on the even numbers and alternate between them on the odd ones - although I think in real life, hopefully I'll be able to stick with one baby at a time! xD<br>  <br>  1. Lilianne Adele "Lily" - I love all forms of the name "Lily," but I chose Lilianne because it looks nice and sounds sweet. Adele is just a pretty name that I think goes well with it.<br>  <br>  2. Madelyn Skylar and Jordan Bryce - I love Madelyn Skylar as a combo, although I don't think I'd use Maddie as a nickname, as it's just so popular now. Jordan is one of my favorite boy names, although I don't like how it's becoming increasingly popular on girls now.<br>  <br>  3. Delilah Elizabeth "Lilah," Ethan Carter, and Gavin Alexander - Lilah is one of my favorite names, although I decided to make it a nickname for Delilah instead to separate it from Lilianne. Ethan and Gavin are two of my favorite boy names.<br>  <br>  4. Danielle Layla "Dani," Jessalyn Belle "Jessa," Jackson Shane, and Aden David - Simply put, they're just names I like. David would be in honor of my father.<br>  <br>  5. Selena Jaelyn, Katherine Vivienne "Kate," Juliana Katrina "Julie," Jacob Daniel "Jake," and Jeffrey Ian "Jeff" - Selena, Katherine, and Juliana are some of my favorite names. I like Jacob for the nickname of Jake, and Jeffrey is a name I like but don't love - but I was running out of names!<br>  <br>  6. Alicia Felicity "Ally," Rosalyn Ashley "Rose," Melinda Rachel "Lindy," James Casper, Nolan Spencer, and Joshua Aaron - Basically, just names that I like.<br>  <br>  7. Kadience Brooke "Kadie," Emilia Jasmine, Adeline Elle "Adelie," Lucas Gabriel "Luke," Liam Connor, Chase Logan, Nathan Dylan "Nate," - I'm running out of names here!

Of course the ignorant will say I'm octo-mom in the making. <br>  <br>  Yet I have had the same job and have been supporting all of them, with extra for wantings. It's not their problem if they think I "need to use condom" or I'm "Octo mom in the making". If I hate them for their ignorance, more people probably do also.

My mother has a big family (she has 8 other siblings) and my father as a semi-big family (four other siblings).<br>  <br>  I don't mind, because it's not my business, if someone has many kids. But it bothers me when they...<br>  1.) Can't afford the kids<br>  2.) Don't give enough attention to their children<br>  3.) Become famous (not that I'm jealous, I just find it annoying!)<br>  4.) Selfish purposes<br>  <br>  That's just my opinion. Personally, I'd love to have a big family! But I wouldn't do it just because I want to be famous. I'd do it if I had the time, energy and money to care for my children.|`|yH39NEXSaa	Well, let's say in the case of Nadya Suleman whose story is known nationally, it's hard not to have an opinion.<br>  <br>  When you have so many children, it's hard for each child to get the individual attention they need. That's my biggest issue with people having many kids...|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Is the baby name section really the appropriate place for this question?  What, exactly, does it have to do with names?<br>  <br>  As for your question, it's not about being able to decide what another person does with their body.  It's more of an issue about diminishing resources.  There's only so much of this planet to go around and anyone who has the intelligence to realize that things we take for granted today may not be around for our children or grandchildren to enjoy needs to consider this when planning their family.  Then there's the attention factor.  Kids need individual attention from each of their parents, and the more kids you have the less of this necessary individual attention they're getting.<br>  <br>  As for how it personally affects other people...that depends on a lot of factors other than how many children a woman has.  No one should have more children than they can financially care for, because then they become a drain on public services and the government tries to take a larger chunk of MY hard-earned money to care for someone who is not able (or, in many cases too damn lazy) to care for the children they bring into this world.  If a woman and her partner can support and care for a half dozen kids then more power to them, I don't really care if they have a large family.|`|nZPGdcKJaa	how big is big?<br>  Personally it obviously does not affect me (unless they are on welfare and using up tax payer's dollars) but I can still have an opinion about it.  <br>  <br>  I just think that after a few kids (2-3) if you have the money and really really really must have more kids then why not adopt?  That's honorable in my mind. My parents did that, twice.<br>  <br>  I think having a HUGE family is selfish.  Why not use that money to help others.  Either really set aside some good $$$ for the kids and maybe help out relatives or charities or whatever else you feel passionate about.<br>  <br>  I am married and in the military.  We make a good amount for us but not for a family.  I'd love to have enough money to have a family (we are 24 and 26) and to also have money to donate to animal shelters and to give back to the military, but I don't make enough to do so.  I guess when I see huge families I'm just jealous.  (even though I only want 1-2 kids)<br>  <br>  -----<br>  <br>  As far as the part asking "Why should you be able to decide what another woman does with her body?"<br>  I don't.<br>  That's just like when people get SO upset when they hear about abortions. I don't get it<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  the overpopulation thing...I don't know numbers but I do know that were are millions of homeless and welfare people. MILLIONS! Imagine if every single person who instead of having a 4th child used that money to help 1 homeless or 1 person on welfare what that would do to the economy! That needy person could live better, get an education and a job and after generations of this the whole US/world would be a better place! (obviously this is unrealistic, but it's just a thought)<br>  <br>  ----<br>  <br>  Just thought of this. I don't really care about the fact that there are so many people and so many kids and everyone is breeding, it's just the stupid people that get to me.  We need to have an IQ cut off to prevent the stupid people from passing on their bad genes|`|xdOgQPEkaa	well we have a big family (5 kids in august) but there is a point where it ges ridiculous and you wonder what these people are thinking. <br>  <br>  i mean some people use tax dollars that could be used for more helpful things just because the want to have a million kids. <br>  <br>  but even i you have all the money in the world, you have to spend individual time with your kids and kids need privacy and listen to them and talk to them and bond with them<br>  <br>  whe i see families on tv with 15 kids and the older kids are teaching the younger kids and they have to move back home because 2 parents cant do it (let alone 1) and they have NO PLAN FOR STOPPING then i cant help of getting a little judgemental.<br>  <br>  i feel bad for the other kids|`|1khNE20iaa	Personally, I'm indifferent to it.<br>  I think it's the paparazzi who feel it's their business.<br>  What I don't understand about Nadya Suleman is that she can pay to have more kids injected to her body, but can't afford a better house for the 6 children she already has.<br>  Our tax money is going towards her, so I think it's natural people are going to want to know whats going on with her.|`|bcM7Lxpeaa	My mom raised seven and I grew up just fine my sisters all have small familys as do I but I loved having 4 sisters growing up you were never alone and always had someone to play with so to say they will not get attention is not true my mom always had time for me even after my dad died when I was only five years old and you got to remember once they hit 5 they can do lot more to keep them self intertained its not like a 2 year old and teens rather go out then stay in with mom so if there spread out it helps to At least I think so.|`|fQAjPXPAaa	Having a big family is great if you can afford it and can give them all attention.

Won't that be grand?<br>  <br>  The reality of it is that if everyone decided they wanted 7 or 8 kids, then their children all wanted 7 or 8 kids, then their grandchildren... you see where I'm going here? People with large families are more likely to be at least partially dependant on the state. Also, not to be patronising but what about overpopulation? Global warming? Oh wait, I forget that these are liberal myths. Having lots of children is selfish, end of story.<br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  Overpopulation is not 'a myth' and people who are against big families are not in favour of legal restrictions, they just want people to exercise a bit of self-control. The population of the entire world is growing rapidly and it doesn't really matter where the majority of those people are located. If we want our great-grandchildren to enjoy the quality of life that we do then we all need to wake up and take responsibility.<br>  <br>  But if I'm totally honest then none of these fair and meaningful reasons are the true cause of my disliking big families. I just despise people who can find nothing better to do with their life than breed themself a football team.

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	I would, first of all, not leave him alone with the nanny.  You knew he was a troublemaker-he can accompany you to the store.  You still only have 1/7 of your children with you, but you can deal with the child.  That is the mom's job, and honestly you are lucky she is not quiting on you and sueing.<br>  <br>  Second of all, two months is a long time to be grounded.  Mainly because you and your husband are most likely not going to go through with him being grounded for two months, and he will learn that you do not mean what you say.  It also will not do much for teaching him to respect his elders and control his anger.  I would sit him down and explain to him that you acted in haste and anger, and then give a new punishment.   I would lessen the grounding to ONE WEEK, with absolutely no priveleges (television, computer, phone, having friends over or going out, nintendo or whatever-he can do household chores and join the family for activities that are not centered around the television and such only and he can do homework and read.  During that week, he also needs to write a letter of apology to the nanny, and he needs to write a report for you and your husband about anger management and the consequences of his actions.<br>  <br>  After he does that, make his priveleges relate to his behavior.  Dessert, electronics, etc. are all dependent upon his behaving and being respectful.<br>  <br>  Have you considered that between your having a large family and a nanny, that he is getting little time with you and that it is not really the nanny he hates, but the fact that he does not get a lot of quality time with his parents?  <br>  <br>  You do not have to do this, but it iis what I would do and you asked what I thik you should do-take it or leave it.|`|BRT2teSqaa	Punching a woman?  Honestly, that REALLY deserves a belt, and grounding.  2 months is good, but that should include no tv, phone, music, etc.  Home, homework, dinner, shower, reading, and bedtime.  <br>  <br>  Punching anyone is horrible enough.  However, even at 11, punching a woman is one of the most dispicable things your son could have done.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	He's angry about something.  Find out what he's angry about.|`|3LL4CEHWaa	beat the s**t out of him.  Who rules the house?|`|12AYMyseaa	lock him in his room for awhile im serious im gonna get a million thumbs down for that. <br>  <br>  Another thing your could do it take him to your county jail or juvenile hall. Just try it worked on me when i was younger. <br>  Your going to scare him but at this point that's really what needs to be done or your going all respect if you haven't already.|`|snVqB2rVaa	I want to start by saying that I have 5 children myself (13, 9,7 yr twins & 9 month baby I just adopted), so I can't even imagine the level of stress you must have.  So I'm very understanding of your need to want help from a nanny.  As a mother reading this, I see your son desperately seeking his parents' attention. I feel 2 months is entirely way too long for a child at that age to be on punishment.  Drunk drivers get less time.  He probably feels like he's not getting enough attention and he's acting out because of it.  I know how difficult it can be to divide up your time but try to spend as much one-on-one time with him as you can. Sometimes just playing his favorite game with him or choosing him to be the only one to go with you while you run a errand may be good for him.  The nanny will get a break and you can tell him that you're glad to have time with just the both of you.  Try positive reinforcement. We all get angry, but we shouldn't base discipline on our anger.  Did you teach him a better way of handling the situation?|`|RMTXanspaa	maybe your son is being bad to get negative attention. maybe he feels that that is the only way to get your attention so he thinks if hes bad the he will be able to be with you more|`|i4Of9SKGaa	pop the little **** upside his head and then tell you husband  to let the boy know who is in charge of the house|`|31b8736a01acf8c8940374f17715dde0aa	i watch a 5 yr old thats the same way. her docter refuses to put her on medication (and i agree compleatly)  instead told us about a thearpy thats to help them comunicate in a calmer (and generaly less violent) way, she loves it and behaves great, most of the time , and shes not a ritilin zombie|`|MktWvlYOaa	get him checked out for ADHD or other behavioral disorders<br>  <br>  or maybe even send him to counseling or an anger management course<br>  <br>  it might help him be able to settle down or not be so angry.<br>  <br>  maybe he's angry that because you have so many kids, he feels neglected. try and make sure that he feels loved and nurtured by you and your husband<br>  <br>  <br>  best of luck =]

sB5dyaczaa	Ok first off you were good to spank him. Have you been doing the reward system? If he throws a book or hits your wife spank him and put him in timeout for 10 minutes.

Also when the mum threatens a child with "wait til dad gets home" shows him that she is no longer in control of the situation to which the child will play upon even more for her. I would use the old rule in this case which is ignore the bad behaviour and try to encourage the good.|`|4Qb1FNH2aa	I don't know but hitting him while telling him not to hit may be giving him the wrong message.|`|9WLq7J9uaa	i have a 6yr old 7yr old 4yr old and 10 month old.  The best thing to do is be consistent in your punishments.  keep doing it until they get the idea.  I vary my punishments a bit, spanking, grounding, no tv, no priviledges, early bedtime.  It is a long process and if you fail to punish after they misbehave it is like starting over because they think that you won't follow through.  <br>  <br>  This sounds horrible but take away what he loves.  I once removed all the toys out of my boys rooms because they refused to keep them clean.  Guess what, it worked, and they got to earn thier toys back. <br>  <br>  I also make sure i spend 15-20 minutes with each of them each day.  It takes me an hour and the quality time makes them feel special and listened to and more receptive to what i'm saying to them.|`|XSIvL60maa	Dont shout lower your voice in a menicing tone and give him a warning.<br>  If he does it again 6 minute time out on the naughty step- if he runs away keep putting him back without talking to him until he stays put and does his full 6 mins.<br>  Cut out the spanking and soap. Just stick to the naughty step. Its slow but effictive.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	start taking his things away. no friends over. no play time. give him 6 minute time-out. early bed time. no t.v. the better he behaves the more he gets back. try another brand of soap.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Most likely this is not the first time I would guess.  Have you tried time out with him?  Instead of yelling at him tell him that he is going to time out because he did what he did,  and let him throw his fit and then talk to him about it.  It does no good to try to yell and talk things over when the moment is heated between the two of you.  You will have to be consistent with consequence for his actions that you and your wife agree on.<br>  <br>  Consistency is the key in stopping this behavior no matter how tired you get.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best,<br>  Jenny
Bqc86DRQaa	If I tell you to go to the hospital and you have the baby, do I get 10 points?<br>  <br>  If they get really strong, go to the hospital. If they last for a while and they start to last for a few seconds more each time, go to the hospital. Definitely go if your water breaks. Good Luck!|`|7rIAd6gGaa	I had a lot of Braxton Hicks during my pregnancies. The only way I knew the difference between them and the real thing once it started was that I felt the real ones in my back as well. Other than that they were exactly the same - at first anyway! I'd say you should time them. If they're regular, or getting closer together, they're probably the real deal. Good luck!!!

Ew2wC9piaa	no we did not wait and we did not use any protection other than pulling out but that was it and at the check up the doc did not say a word. and we have not used any birth control at all heck after a few months we quite pulling out and thankfully we are not pregnant again yet i am not ready but i think hubby is. he is always asking when it gets close to that time of the month|`|aJLx0nhNaa	No, pull-out.  When my doctor asked she wasn't remotely surprised that we'd had sex early but she gave me the fish eye about our "contraception" method.  I believe her exact words were "Are you trying to get pregnant again?"  Which we deserved.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Well my midwife said "Wait until I put the stitches in" (she had to wait until the day after I gave birth, long story) so yes.<br>  <br>  I use ecological breastfeeding|`|CzKrqgmgaa	i waited the 6 weeks. i was healed by 4 weeks and had stopped bleeding but i had no sex drive and didnt care about it so when the doc said i was ok to have sex again it was a blessing and a curse lol|`|GognIJnBaa	Definitely waited 'til the doc ok'd it.  Wanted to make sure all was healed down there before starting up again.|`|sOZoonICaa	no just take it slowly your be fine.|`|AA11348933	After the birth of my first baby we waited until my six-week post-partum visit to get okayed to have sex.  I also had stitches and it hurt for a year after giving birth to have sex.<br>  <br>  After my second baby we had sex 3 weeks after the birth because I felt up to it.  We used condoms.  I had a much easier recovery this time around.  No pain whatsoever.|`|mAJZFmIEaa	Yes i waited. I got checked at 3 weeks because i had stitches and they were healed and everything else looked fine but i waited until my 6 week check just to make sure and i wanted to be on birth control|`|hNIof0lbaa	I didnt wait for the 6mth check up -- I was healed. Everyone is different though. We used condoms until the check up. Then I got an IUD put in a week or so after the check up.|`|WEeWYNroaa	We waited 5 and a half weeks. And used a condom. As long as it doesn't hurt and any stitches are healed then you should be  ok. Just be very very gentle.|`|XSol0H6Uaa	No.  Pull out method.|`|KYkoPHpsaa	yes,,,and still waiting... im too scared to have sex without the okay lol  :(
xCXyCojGaa	Believe it Honey!! I did 8 pregnancy tests before it hit me that I was pregnant. I had combination of faint lines and dark lines but as the days went on the lines became darker and more distinct. I confirmed with a blood test, that's the only way your mind is going to be at ease. I'm 30 weeks now and can't wait :-) good luck!!|`|BzCYQlcuaa	i got pregnant right after my period too. my doctor said i ovulated early! you can get a false negative but never a false positive. go get a blood test and stick it in baby daddy's face! and get ready you going to be a mother! this is great! congrats!!!!|`|zXIDR1INaa	I would say you are pregnant.  You can ovulate at anytime during your cycle.  There is also pre *** that can get you pregnant.  I doubt you would of got more than one positive test if you were not pregnant.

ucF2xy6Aaa	how about some work from home jobs? depends on if you have a computer at home, but a lot of places do customer service. also, see if you have any customer service places that are hiring near you. phone work means you'll be sitting down constantly working on a computer.|`|vsuXCMqzaa	First of all, apply for everything that you can such as Medicaid and WIC and any other programs that are available for someone who's pregnant and without a job. You may be surprised at the assistance you can get and that will help you out.<br>  <br>  Second, start interviewing like crazy. Where clothes that will possibly detract from the pregnancy, if you can. During the interview focus on your skills and why you would be a good candidate for them and also be honest about the pregnancy. Tell them your due date and how much time you would need off (not want but actually need). Also tell them upfront why you are looking for a job.<br>  <br>  It is true that some will overlook you because of the pregnancy but there are plenty out there that won't.<br>  <br>  Third, you may want to check into things like Avon, Mary Kay, Body Shop at Home, Pampered Chef, Tupperware, etc. because if there's one you like you just may be able to make money on the side.<br>  <br>  Wish the best for you and your baby.|`|H2IhRXIIaa	Try babies r us!!|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	I don't mean to sound like I'm trying to be smart or anything, but the sad reality is the majority of jobs given to pregnant woman are much in the same as those given to 15 year olds.<br>  <br>  As someone already said, not many places are keen on hiring noticeably pregnant women, and some places even feel pregnant women can not be hired, since they are an insurance liability.<br>  <br>  As far as places that may consider you, fast food places such as McDonalds, or take away pizzerias are a good bet.<br>  Your local supermarket may be keen to take you on as a check-out attendant, or if worse comes to worst, you can deliver fliers in your area for a bit of extra cash.<br>  <br>  It may not be glorious work, but it is work none the less.|`|plI0WOrUaa	That's a tough one.  Not many people are interested in hiring a noticeably pregnant women unfortunately.  What about something part time for now??  They would be more likely to hire you.  Plus, the hours arent so long.  I would say that would be your best bet right now.  good luck|`|pCJUIIQEaa	I will have to say at a lil store or like wal-mart, target, walgreens. Anything that is easy for you. Mainly at lil stores. I hope this helps you. Good luck.|`|HYveAhbUaa	Well, places like Target/Walgreens etc. always seem to be hiring or at least they have the application booth.  It may not be the ideal job, but sometimes it gets to the point where you can't care anymore.  You'd be on your feet, but I don't think there would be that much labor if you were a cashier or something.|`|zhwR2XiBaa	McDonald's

That's what it's called. Teach your kids the correct terms while they are young.|`|xK5lWU3qaa	I call it what it is, "a penis". I am not sure why people are into being dishonest (by omission) with their children about simple biological facts. Children are actually more curious about sex when they sense that adults are withholding information from them.<br>  <br>  True story: When my son was about 2, I was changing my baby daughter's diaper when he asked, "Mom, how come boys have a penis and girls just have a little butt?" I will never forget this -- it was so incredibly adorable!<br>  <br>  More importantly, my son is a preteen now and he is quite well adjusted. All of this is true, in spite of the fact that I simply explained to him (when he was 2) that his sister did not have a "little butt". In fact, I told him that she has a vagina!|`|8SjoUQmEaa	By seven years old, she should know that boys and girls are different "down there".  <br>  I don't see why gender differences is something to hide from children, all you need to explain is "girls have vaginas, boys have penises", and if they ask "why?" just tell them "because boys and girls are different", and that should satisfy they're curiosity.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	Well I just tell my children that they are private parts. When my sons saw their twin sisters for the first time they asked why the girls didn't have what they had and I simply told them "Girls have different privates then boys" and they just said "Okey."|`|HYveAhbUaa	Ive heard it is best to teach young kids the *proper* name, but no one wants their 7 and 4 year old to go around talking about penis's, so come up with a clever nickname.  A little boy in a day care I used to work at called it his "pecker" which I thought was hilarious.|`|qPbKJeXzaa	Use the proper word - penis, and explain why girls and boys are different in terms they can understand at their age.  The 7 year old is likely to have more searching questions than your 4 year old.  If you answer them honestly, then no problems should occur.|`|z0ro3VkJaa	Call it a penis.

JlG8XgDvaa	I never got morning sickness either just great fatigue and nausea for the first couple of weeks. I never really got a whole lot of symptoms until later, like 4 or 5 months into it. That when the uterus grew and I was always short of breath...then you start feeling the kicking. <br>  <br>  A great website that helps, week by week: www.pregnancy.com|`|2DsgflhOaa	Well personally i never really got morning sickness.. at least yet. Just a little of icky feelings now and then. heightened senses is a huge thing for me that started right away. Moodiness, a lot of fatigue.

AIskV0efaa	i would say stick with the metformin, maybe your dose just wasnt high enough
1YHih8wyaa	that unconditional love. morning breath? whats that hahaha sorry i just think its so funny when they dont care as long as they can sleep in bed with you that night. also love how in the end you are the only one that can make them happy. my sil came over and my daughter was very irritable. she says to me, here let me try something. her bf says to her "honey, her mom is the only one that can make her happy right now" she tried and tried and as soon as she handed her over my daughter was smiling. :o) but the list goes on and on.|`|uP08b6K4aa	I don't think there is one individual thing about being a parent, as everyday throws up more surprises as to what your children may do or say or what they've achieved at school.<br>  <br>  If I have to pick one thing, my favourite thing is the love you feel for your children and the unconditional love they give back, knowing that you created such a wonderful thing and have the joy of watching them grow each and every day.<br>  <br>  Good Luck on the birth of your child x|`|OYy82bAYaa	watching them laugh, their first step, their first tooth, their first words.

My eldest girls are in the dress up stage, and my son is in the first tooth stage so its fun and games most times, other times you beg for sleep. LOL|`|AkFag8tNaa	Knowing they love you even after you've spent the afternoon fussing at them. Unsolicited hugs and "I love yous".

And being a parent is an experience, a good one! You learn so much from your kids, and you realize how your parents were with you, and why they were always so careful in taking good care of you, and made you eat those veggies and that horrible soup! <br>  But it`s great, you get to take care of a little innocent baby, and make your own rules, and it`s fun! It gets tiring at times, and kids well, they do push your buttons, but it is exciting to learn how to raise them and figure out the little things. <br>  Every parent is different but ultimately our goal is the same one, or hopefully it is. To raise a good kid, with education and morals and family values, so start talking about this things with your husband on how you`re going to raise your child, even if when the time comes you change your views, the important thing is that you have future views for your little one who`s going to be a reflection of you both.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	Having her look up to me and learn new things (especially from me).  When she comes home from school and says she saw something/did something that reminded her of me.  Her kissing or hugging me for no reason other then because she loves me.  All the little things like the home made cards, the good night kisses, the waking up and seeing her at the side of my bed, etc.|`|fdceaa401c42420a6b05129fc81a4757aa	Bedtime and peace and quiet lol. Only kidding, had a bit of a stressful day, my 2 have colds! <br>  There are so many things, watching them grow from babies, starting to learn things, first smiles, first giggle, being able to comfort them when they're upset. My eldest (16mths) has the best sense of humour, I could sit and watch him all day. When he gets tired he climbs up on my knee for cuddles as he holds my hand... best feeling in the world x|`|WMPqVYe1aa	hi, theres lots of favourite things everyday.

kpnSKV6Eaa	i am 100% pro choice. i believe if you can not care for a child in the proper way that you could always go the adoption route first but i mean c'mon. everyone sitting here saying that your killing your baby and it has a life are more than likely firm believers in the one they call GOD. Furthermore if they were true believers then they would also believe that GOD has a plan for everyone, even the unborn babies, which means that if someone has ended their childs life before it really begins then it was part of GODS plan.. obviously he thought that the child would be better off in his kingdom then here with a horrible parent. or a drug addict, or someone thats just physically uncapable of caring for a child..<br>  <br>  i also believe that a child should not be born into this world addicted to drugs that there mother ingested during birth.. its not fair to the child. if they cant stay off then they dont need to have a baby. <br>  <br>  I do not believe however in getting an abortion after the child has turned from an embryo to a fetus.. they need to make their mind up before then.. you cant decide to bring it in and then take it out.. <br>  <br>  I will probably get a lot of thumbs down for being pro choice but i dont really care.. some people just should not have children. <br>  <br>  and just so you know i personally would not get an abortion myself.. its not something i would do ever. but i still believe in letting people choose for themselves.. everyone whos against it is just stupid... stay out of peoples lives and mind your own bees wax.. geeze|`|T48smu01aa	no|`|iHjt2nWyaa	No I don't.|`|nZPGdcKJaa	you obviously need a better education because you can't even spell, so WHO is going to take you seriously when you talk about such a controversial subject like abortion?<br>  <br>  but just to humor you:<br>  abortion is a necessary medical procedure that doesn't affect you at all. If YOU don't to ever get then then don't.  It's none of your business.  It's not "killing a baby"<br>  there is no baby to kill. There is a fetus which is removed from the body.  That's it. <br>  I find it hilarious when people say abortions are different in some case,like rape or medical complications. It's still a fetus. that is the same parasitic organism that they claim is "murder" when a teen uses abortion as "birth control" <br>  it's the same thing people.<br>  if anything with a heartbeat is "alive" and therefore murder to stop it, then what about abortion before there is a heartbeat? what about conjoined twins that have two heads? no beating heart, but a fully functional brain?|`|qN5iVvAFaa	I don't believe in abortion.... I think the only way that abortion would be right is if the woman was raped.... otherwise there is always other options... adoption, what about all of the women out there who can't get pregnant on their own??? and need to adopt? what if that was your only option? and everyone was aborting babies, then you would have no chance of having a baby|`|w7fCw6WTaa	I think you should learn to spell.|`|661c2533ab1a94252c3ab39ac6661101aa	Abortion is like killing a human being without giving him or her a chance to live his or her own life. i'm 1000000% sure that abortion is wrong. if u or somebody you know is thinking about it please tell that person to think twice. let's take this for example if President Obama mother had aborted him, he would have never became our President. the child that u aborted could have been a President, Senator, a Pastor or a celebrity. think about it.|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	I don't believe in abortion's cause u shouldn't have unprotected sex then put an innocent life in jeapordy.

I saw them at a smokers store.|`|F20dtwiuaa	tell her not to bother,as people will be coming to see the baby and dont want a gift at all, they are more likely to bring a gift themselves. they will probably make there own cup of tea.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	That's one of those things that sounds like a nice idea before you have the baby and then is a huge pain in the butt terrible idea once you have the baby.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Just make nice birth announcements with the babys photo.|`|AA11348933	You mean the mother is giving gifts?

They have the child's name included in the story.  But you need to do this around 2 weeks in advance and they cost 10-20 dollars.  My 4 year old  loves to play with blocks, any type of sport, painting, and superheros.
hUbNKOTsaa	One method you could do is when she gets home from school she can have a snack and then has to do homework(if she has any). then she can do whatever until dinner.  after dinner she takes a shower(unless she likes to take it in the morn) and she can do whatever until 8. at 8 she has to do something quiet, like reading or drawing, until  830. at 830, she gets ready for bed and is in bed at nine. that way if she gets up at 630, she gets at least 9 1/2 hours of sleep, which is perfect for her age. on non-school or church nights, she can stay up until 10. im 12 and go to bed at 10 on school nights and 11 on weekends<br>  <br>  and if she gets up naturally and isnt grumpy, she is definitly getting enough sleep and can stay up later.|`|hn5rnGgxaa	Does she seam tired? If so keep her bedtime the same but if not what about 8:30 or 9:00 on school nights and on weekends maybe 9:30. Hope this helps!!|`|qLuodu3Raa	my kids go to bed at 9 every night even weekends becuase we get up early all week anyways and i have no trouble getting them up we have to get up and be moving by 7am also|`|AA10953561	Well, I think now that she's hitting that early puberty stage it's good to make sure she gets a minimum of 8 hours (pre-teens and teens actually need more sleep than the rest of us because their bodies are going through such a dramatic change). At first I thought between 8:30 and 9:00 would be fine, and I still think that would be good for her. If she went to bed at 8:30 she'd still be getting 10 hours of sleep, which is good. <br>  <br>  My daughter is six and her bedtime is 8:00, and she does really well with that time table. We try to stick close to that on the weekends, she might stay up a half hour later on weekends, but we try to keep the same schedule so we don't have to fight with her during the week. She recently spent the weekend (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) nights at her aunts house (it was a three day weekend from school). Her aunt let her and her cousins stay up until eleven one night, midnight the next, and ten the next, when we got her back it was a nightmare getting her back into her routine. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|z0ro3VkJaa	You should probably consider a period of quiet time between 8:00 and 9:00, for her to read quietly or perhaps go to sleep, where she can relax prior to bed, and still get between 9-10 hours of sleep.<br>  <br>  It is longer than she is staying up now, so she will be happy, and it will still be downtime for her, so you can be happy about it.|`|Wnmg850Paa	I have a nine year old, nearly 10. She goes to bed at 8. She gets up at 7 a.m. If she doesn't get enough sleep she is a bit wicked during the day. On the weekends I am a bot more lenient depending what we have planned.|`|LSJyE4d0aa	Between 8:00 and 9:00|`|SxPhldhhaa	I went to bed at about 9:00 and got up at 7:00 when I was 10, although my homework load was considerably heavy (but that's what I got for choosing to attend a magnet school in 6th grade!) I'm 13 now and I still go to sleep and wake up at about the same times.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't let her stay up later, though. To be honest, the more sleep you get the better, at that age, since I'm assuming she's about to hit her growth spurt and having enough sleep is extremely important. I think you might be able to relax her bedtime a little to 8:20 and still achieve enough sleep if she wakes up a little later. On weekends, you could allow her to stay up a bit longer since she has the option of sleeping in, but I'd still recommend having her in bed by 9:00.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fnogJGNoaa	When I was 10 (practically 11) I went to bed at 9 pm. I practiced musical instruments for less than 3 hours, and had an activity almost every day of the week. I'm 11 now. I'm going to middle school and I am not at all stressed.<br>  Get her to do her homework for the 1st hour once she gets home. Then let her do anything she wants, except play computer for more than 30 minutes straight. Bad for the eyes. Ya.<br>  Anyway, her schedule is pretty good the way it is. If she is waking up naturally around 6:30-40, she is getting enough sleep.<br>  Let her go about 30 minutes later, because she is waking up 30 minutes earlier.<br>  On the weekends, still try to stay within 30 mins of her regular time so you don't mess up her schedule. Weekends are catchup and family activities. Possibly, parties. Just let her relax on weekends. She will not be tired at all.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	I think since she wakes up at 6:30ish then if you let her stay up later she will wake up later and it will mess up the school schedule, but if she can stay up later and wake up at the same time (which i doubt that she can do after a week or so of trying) then let her do it. I think that on friday and saturday nights then you can allow her to stay up until 9 o'clock maybe even 10. Good Luck! and try this method it won't hurt.|`|xIlIbZJtaa	You know best as you are her mum and it sounds like your daughter's sensible too. As she tends to wake up half an hour early I would suggest that she stay up half an hour late to 8.30. It'll win you some points, make her feel valued and she'll still be getting her quoter once her body clock adjusts. Still aim for a similar time at the weekend but be flexible if you have people over or whatever.

Just be yourself and don't be the biggest *** like your sister.  Eventually people will realize that you are a completely different person and you will have your own friends.  You may even have to just come out and tell some people that you are not your sister and they shouldn't be so shallow as to judge you without getting to know you first.  Unfortunately most people will assume you are alike because you are twins and because you are sisters.  Just continue to be a better person and the friends you make who stick by you through this you know are true friends.  Good luck.|`|JbbfVyVGaa	you cant change who your sister is, but you can control what you are like. hang out with friends that are like you. its harsh to call your sister a slut, because she's your sis. try to really put yourself in her position, is she doing it for attention? because she thinks people wont like her? because she thinks she wont fit in? for a guy? to rebel against your parents/authorities?<br>  once you can understand her more, and talk to her about why she acts the way she does, only THEN it will be easier for you to convince people you aren't  like her. istead of saying "I'M NOT LIKE HER AT ALL!" which may hurt her secretly and make people believe you are (believe it or not) say "she's my sister, not me. just because we are twins doesnt mean we are exactly alike." calmly & in the nicest way possible. shes your sis, but hang out with people who let you be yourself & you feel comfortable around. you arent forced to hang out with her. just be yourself, they'll start to see eventually... :)|`|AlErWVFQaa	First of all, you are definitely your sister.

But I think you should just lay low for the rest of the school year, in most cities, counties, and districts, there is only basically one quarter left of school. I think you should not think anyone thinks of you that way unless they mistake you for your sister and say something bad to you mistakenly or say something bad to you knowingly on purpose. The way you act is determined by your personality. If your sister acts that way it is because she is that way. So show the people in your school you are not like your sister and show them a friendly or go-lucky personality or something. Anything but a s|utty one. Try your hardest to remember to not harass any boys you like, that can be a tough one for some girls and that reputation as a stalker and such is equally as bad as a s|ut. So make sure you just stay out of trouble and I'm sure you'll be fine.|`|orVFTlKdaa	by not acting like one. and showing them the bettre sides of you. show them your funny and smart by like talking to them about their intersets. make them forget that your sisters.

If these symptoms continue its best you tell you parents or guardian and tell them to get you to the doctor. Best of luck!
78d9f43ff465a0f4544131bd918a95d8aa	March 16th or so if you have a 28 day cycle.  There are tests that can be taken up to four days before your missed period but the consensus seems to be to wait until you've missed your first day.|`|JNoJWcFvaa	There are a lot of older ways to do the tests, but none that you would want to do in this day and age.<br>  <br>  A urine test is non-invasive and although the chemicals are on the pee-stick, they do not come in contact with the body and will not harm you or your baby.<br>  <br>  The dollar store has some pretty good tests from what I hear for only $1. Walmart has ones that are around $4.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hubpages.com/_rkut/hub/Home-Remedy-Pregnancy-Test" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/_rkut/hub/Home-Remed...</a>
VD4NQMLLaa	No problem walking nude in front of the children. They don't think about nudity that age like adults do. But there will come be a time that you should worry about it. But if you consider is not a problem then they will learn to accept your nudity and theirs.|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	*sigh*... this exasperates me. Why is it that people think of the natural human body as nothing more than a 'sexual' being. It is not, it nourishes a baby, it is a source of comfort, it can even be art (ask michelangelo). It is a very American perception that a naked body is a sexual thing. It is not, you can make it sexual, but otherwise it is a normal natural human body. You are showing your son what a 'real' woman looks like aside from the airbrushed plastic nonsense he sees on t.v. (not saying you aren't thin, just saying your body in its natural state looks a bit different. everyones does)<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with being nude, i've been to many a beach in Europe where people are nude and children are there and nothing is thought of it. It is normal, and natural. <br>  <br>  I'm not saying your question is ridiculous, but some of these answers are.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	families are a safe place to be nude..its your home. There should be no hang ups..a butt is a butt is a butt|`|AA10953561	It really depends. I don't like to be naked around my six year old, but that's because she's starting to ask questions, like "When will I get bumps on my chest?" or "Why do you have hair down there?" It's awkward and hard to explain to a six year old. I don't mind if she sees me in my panties and my bra, but completely naked, I do try to avoid that.<br>  <br>  I guess when they hit school age and become more curious is probably the best time to stop being naked around your children. Who knows what they're talking about with their friends at school?<br>  <br>  I'd say use your best judgement. If it's not a problem for you now, then wait until you think it's becoming an issue.|`|1c1f532d0b7b25b3aae753390d6e60b8aa	I don't see it as a problem, I have a 7 year old son and a 5 year old daughter - both of them see me in the bath or getting dressed.  People should feel comfortable in their bodies and making naked a "dirty word" will do nothing to reassure children that it is ok.<br>  <br>  I don't walk around the house naked, but if my children catch me in the nude - I don't make a scene<br>  <br>  Nice Guy - you are absolutely right - nakedness is part of life - we weren't born wearing clothes and the only time it is wrong is when it is sexualised.  My children are extremely well adjusted and they ask questions about body hair and boobs etc - I answer as honestly as I can in a way that they will understand.  At the ages they are, they both know in simplistic terms that their bodies will change, my daughter will grow breasts and hair as well as getting her period.  She understands it and it saves any awkward questions at a later stage when she may feel I have been secretive.<br>  <br>  Edit - I couldn't have put it better myself Rachel|`|n7uoE9wmaa	Why the big hangup about nudity?  There is nothing wrong, nasty, obscene or disgusting about the naked body.  It is a FACT that children in nudist households have less sexual hangups and are altogether better adjusted than those in clothed (textile) households.  And it should not just be the mother who is naked, but the father and the children.  I will probably get loads of unnecessary thumbs downs for this but just try it.|`|JnnBiFK4aa	as long as ur comfortable - do it! i think u will know when to stop and be more discret..<br>  <br>  i think its a good thing really...|`|z0ro3VkJaa	There is absolutely, 100%, nothing wrong with that.<br>  <br>  First of all, he is 6, don't even think of projecting your preconceptions onto him.<br>  <br>  Secondly, there is nothing wrong with any part of the human body, and it is ridiculous to feel you need to hide it.<br>  <br>  And finally, neither of you should have to start feeling uncomfortable about it, and you being uncomfortable can convey a very negative image about his body to him, teaching him that his body is something to be ashamed of.|`|cPlDc7I1aa	There was the same sort of question on here a few weeks back and i was astounded at some of the answers!  OMG, there are so many people out there with hangups about the human body!!  Unbelievable! <br>  Not to pick on anyone in particular, but Taz C - you say it's ok if it was an accident, but WHY is it wrong if no attempt to cover up was made??  What's so wrong about it?  <br>  <br>  I have two sons, aged 5 and 10 and i have never hidden my body from them.  I dont parade around the house naked, but in the mornings we are all to-ing and fro-ing from the bathroom, washing, showering, getting dressed, etc.   We don't lock the doors when we are bathing or showering, if my two need the toilet while i'm showerig they just come on in and use it! My two don't even bat an eyelid when they see me naked, they are not embarrassed by it, and they certainly don't make an issue of it!<br>  <br>  And what's with people on here being fearful of their kids asking questions?? There are people here who seem embarrassed to be asked perfectly innocent questions about the human body!  How else are your children going to learn?!! My kids were curious when they were smaller and would ask questions, and i would answer them as simply as i could. They know the difference between the male and female anatomy, they know that 'mummies' have periods and why, etc. We haven't skirted around the whole 'where do babies come from'<br>   yet but when it is asked it will be answered accordingly.<br>  <br>   There are so many people on here saying its wrong??!!  Somebody tell me, how is it wrong???  Its the human body for crying out loud! <br>  <br>  All i will say is my son will be a teenager in a few years and if i sense that he is in any way uncomfortable with seeing me naked, or me seeing him naked, then things will change.<br>  <br>  ...added - likewise Kerry K - you also make a good point!  thumbs up!!!  :o)|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	It's fine, nudity should not be something to be afraid of. There is also a big difference between nudity and sexuality. <br>  <br>  I walk around the house tin a bra or sometimes topless these days (I have a 6 yer old) much of that is due to the fact that I am breastfeeding my 5 month old and by 5pm i'm just tired of pulling my shirt up. Of coarse i'd never be doing that if I thought my son was uncomfortable; however I nursed my oldest until he was 3 so he is still used to the bobbies|`|wUWvO5r6aa	Girl do it is your house hahaha, my mom has always been really open she won't care if we see her booty naked i never had a problem with it. Now I have two kids a boy and a girl and I do it to. Is not like I run around my house booty naked but I am not shy around them. My little girl ask a lot of questions about my body but is okay I like that she wants to learn about our body. My son just kinda stares like this crazy lady LOL..|`|iMaTMWMxaa	I don't see a problem with it to be honest. Neither do I see a problem with a father being seen naked by his 6 yr old daughter. If you're getting dressed, then I should hope you're going to change your underwear! which may mean someone in your house might see you do it.<br>  <br>  In our house, we are all getting dressed at the same time to get ready for school, pre-school, work etc.|`|9773a1274f33361977f590679b7c92a8aa	Whenever these questions come up, people get all in a tizzy.  I find it odd but that's because I grew up in a home where nudity was commonplace.  Now that I have a daughter of my own, who is now 14, it's the same way and always has been.  There's not any oddness to it as a family and it definitely doesn't make kids grow up warped.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	If it's not purposely then it's okey if it's just once in a while he walks in on you or something but when I'm around my six year old son, or any of my children except the young ones I still have to bathe with I try my best to keep myself covered.|`|G5Wnd1KDaa	As a parent, I feel that you should do what you think is right.  There is a huge hangup in the US about nudity.  Simple nudity is being perceived as lewd when it is far from the case, in my opinion.  There are many families that participate in nude recreation as a family with their kids.  Simple nudity is a far cry from having sex in front of your kid, something I think everyone who has answered would agree is wrong.<br>  <br>  But, as you can see from the variety of answers you've gotten so far, this eventually boils down to your individual morals.  Here are mine where nudity goes with family:<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with it and the various members of our family routinely see one another naked at some point in the day.  We don't wander about the house naked all day, but in the morning we usually are, and if someone has to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night we don't get dressed to go.  We have an enclosed back yard and enjoy sunbathing nude while our daughter swims nude in her pool (she is 4).  She's already started asking questions and has done so since about the time she learned to talk.  We don't expect this to end any time soon.  When she asks a question, we answer it in an age appropriate manner.  Should she ask when she will get "bumps", we would probably explain that it happens when she gets taller like Mommy (for now).   If she asks at 6 or 8 yrs old, we might explain puberty.  You can't make a steadfast set of rules for this, but instead have to use your own good judgment. <br>  <br>  Wish you the best of luck, and I'll include a couple of links below.|`|o2H6DEHLaa	it happens all the time at my house, i don't walk around naked, but if i'm having a shower or dressing i don't lock the door,so my 6 year old son has seen me naked lots of times.<br>  actually even this summer during holidays he show-red with me. honestly i don't think he cares has i'm his mum, if in the future any of us feel uncomfortable then we introduce a bit more of privacy, but i think i'm still quite few years away from it.|`|WMPqVYe1aa	Hi, i only have girls and they always walk in on me,(to ask silly questions or sign homework)sometimes i lock the door so i have a shower in peace. its ok- its a bit of a fact of life and normal.|`|dAJiXPecaa	Naw I don't think it's wrong. People over react to everthing now days. As long as your not being sexual, or he's not asking for you to cover up. I have a 9yo and I streak to the bedroom.He kindly turns his head.|`|6gM98TRjaa	it is completely natural and normal... <br>  it wont affect their sexuality ..<br>  if anything they will benefit from it ie knowing that adults have hair and breasts etc.. <br>  as long as it is accidental ;)|`|XgyHPhMzaa	There is nothing wrong with it and if you feel better being nude then you might want to join AANR look it up on the net.
LcdaUleUaa	Too hard to say.  You're only three days late.  You could be pregnant, but those symptoms could easily be a combination of stress, PMS and imagination.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey hun,<br>  <br>  Sounds like you could be pregnant. I know the waiting is really annoying. Because you want the answer already.<br>  But keep positive.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you are having hormonal changes in the body.<br>  God Bless x Test when you ready. Could be actuall pregnancy or mind.|`|Fxq5sFfXaa	i don't think you are pregnant. I think you thought you might be so the symptoms are 'in your head'.  i have had 4 children and didn't start feeling any of the symptoms that you were experiencing until closer to the 2nd month. if you are, then congratulations   : )
t0mb150gaa	There is really no way to tell how the delivery will go...but people do say that the second time sound is suppose to be easier. I know for my sister it worked out that way and her labour time was less but when i asked my doctor they said there is really no guarantee that it will be easier.  Congrats though!|`|S4DNQkFraa	It should be. The more kids you have, then they just kinda slide right out....G/L!!|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	It was for me. My 1st, 19 and a half hours. Was induced. Experienced the most horrible back labor. Had a C Section. All in all, a pretty bad experience.<br>  My 2nd, went into labor at 3 am, was pushing by 5am and he was born at 7:12 am. He came really, really fast. He was 10.3 and I had him VBAC,<br>  I would say it went a lot faster and a lot smoother. I wasn't induced and that worked out far better for me, then the 1st time.<br>  <br>  2nd labors usually go quicker.<br>  <br>  I wonder how fast my 3rd will be born in. We will find out in October.|`|AFjfkrjcaa	I have had seven children and some labors have been easier than others, but it doesn't seem to get easier with each pregnancy.  My most painful and difficult labors were my second, my fourth, and my seventh.  It's just different with every baby.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	i was induced with my first but from when my waters broke till he was born was 10hours and didnt have pain till waters broke.<br>  with my second from when my waters broke was only 2hrs so she was very fast|`|pIBOSkfsaa	if your hips hurt or ache this time around, its a good sign of a fast delivery
XSol0H6Uaa	Yes, it will go away.  Try chewing gum, maybe you can spot train it away.  Just a thought, it might work.|`|113FoyMFaa	probably.<br>  <br>  I had baby fat on my cheeks until I was 20.  lol.  what get's rid of it?  time.|`|Kbz8XEf9aa	baby fat is a myth...its fat from being fat... or it could just be loose skin, sometimes you cant get rid of it and the only remedy is plastic surgery..sucks yea|`|PJFeRy0Zaa	Stop eating McDonald's. no, its just baby fat
kmOx8Hu6aa	Yes, I have. The first sign for me was sore, swollen breasts (which are uncommon for me before I get my period, but apparently one of the first early signs of pregnancy). I started getting this symptom only 4 days after I conceived.... Also got very bloated, had mild cramping, and was fatigued. <br>  <br>  Could be either, really- if youre TTC I hope youre pregnant :):):)|`|I3TWkMaqaa	i havnt but my aunt had all those symptoms when she was pregnant. this would be the time youd be feeling them too. and dont get your hopes down. ive had 3 negative pregnancy tests but im still convinced im pregnant, so i went to the doctors today to get a blood test (which should be like 100% correct) ive also heard from numerous people that a positive didnt show up on their pregnancy tests until like 3 or 4 months pregnant, sometimes as late as 8. your hormone levels just arent high enough.<br>  <br>  hope i helped, baby dust!|`|zj32aZ2eaa	You're getting negative tests cuz it's too early. You need to wait until you miss your period or at 6 weeks along. You would probably be only about 3 weeks right now if you were pregnant, so you wouldn't get a positive result for a while yet. Don't waste your money, just wait and see.|`|pIBOSkfsaa	If you are pregnant these symptoms seem to be very early. I would just save the tests (cause they aren't cheap) and just wait and see if you get your period.  Good luck
cnK4X2sZaa	come on!?!?<br>  vagina mouth..|`|S4DNQkFraa	No. ONLY intercourse can get you pregnant. Sperm has to meet the egg....DUH!

NbJbZXtGaa	Don't take him to the ER, it is not that urgent. Sounds like he may need antibiotics. Take him to a pediatrician. Might cost you $100, but much cheaper than the ER.|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	This really isn't ER worthy.  Take him to his pediatrician...even without medicaid, an office visit typically costs less than $100.|`|2ZOkyoSJaa	First of all you ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting him get into this situation! Please don't give that his Medicaid was cut mess. I have worked setting people up with state benefits before and I know how it works. The only way for it to be cut is if you have started making enough to pay it yourself. Also, the income level for kids under 18 is so high most people do qualify if they can't afford it on their own. Proper medical car is so important for kids. This is a prime example of this. <br>  <br>  <br>  Now to your question. Yes taking him to the ER since you can't take him to the Dr would be a good idea mainly because he has been sick for so long. A fever of 101.5 itself is not too bad and him not eating is OK as long as he is getting lots of fluids. you should be giving him tylenol and motrin intermittently. In another words give him tylenol first and then 4 hours later give him motrin then four hour later give him tylenol again. Letting him go too long between doses gives the fever a chance to get back up and then it's harder for the next dose to work. I hope he gets well soon.|`|dgRTkccBaa	You should call the doctors office and tell them this, perhaps they can work out a payment plan.  if you take him to the ER you're still going to be responsible for the bill and it's going to be WAY more money than the ped's office.  Also, if you have no medical coverage you should see if there are any free clinics in your area.  You need to have someplace to take your son when he's sick.|`|lFlapW8maa	dont go to the ER just go to the doctors office or a med clinic.  the ER will cost a bundle.  a med clinic a lot less.<br>  <br>  but yes 5 days with a unbreaking temp is too long.  it might be an ear infection with no other symptoms.  just go get it checked out.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Ask your doctor if there is a clinic in your area that charges on a sliding scale.  Or maybe you can work out a payment arrangement with your doctor.  This child needs to be seen.|`|AA10751264	I think if you take him to the ER they have to treat him whether you have coverage or not and you should be able to negotiate that bill down with them later and be put on a low monthly payment plan. Here is the thing with your child, you just can't replace him, or his health were he to lose it. De-hydration is a real serious concern with any child running a long term temp. and not eating or drinking very well, if he had strep throat, it can go into rheumatic fever and damage his heart, or become localized such as in septic hip, which if not treated right away, they can no longer walk, it might be a virus and he will get over it, if it is bacterial, he made need antibiotics to prevent the infection from spreading into a problem more serious, but only some basic tests by your Dr. will tell you for sure. I know it is so hard when money is short and you can't afford it, but, also, you just take  a big  chance of not having him checked either and I know later in life, you will be so glad that you put his safety and priorities first. Good luck to you and the baby and God Bless.|`|6DGHGegzaa	I would definitely get him to the doctor.  A fever that lasts longer than 2-3 days can be a sign of something serious.  Make sure he is getting plenty of fluids!  If you can't afford your regular doctor, search online for a free or reduced price clinic in your area.  If all else fails, swallow your pride and ask your doctor if you can work something out for lowered payment, or payment over a few weeks.  You'd be surprised at how many doctors are willing to do this!  <br>  <br>  If he says his head hurts it could be because he is dehydrated, or maybe has an ear infection.  <br>  <br>  Also remember, if you are taking his temp orally add one degree or if axillary (under his arm) add about 1.5 degrees to get his true temperature (what it would be if you measured it rectally). So if he's at 101 orally, his temp is probably closer to 102.|`|UEtkRU3gaa	Seriously......are you okay?  Insurance or not, the health and well being of your children come FIRST....PERIOD.  How would you feel if there were something seriously wrong w/him and something unthinkable happened to him just because you didn't take him to get seen.  Is this a fake question?  Any mother in her right mind wouldn't let this go on for as long as you have.  Take your son to the ER immediately.  Shame on you...|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Yes, you should probably take him in.  Give him plenty to drink he could by dehydrated.  Because it has been five days I would say take him into a clinic, not the er.  The er is very expensive.  A walk in clinic will be cheaper.
AA10196172	If a test says positive, you are.<br>  <br>  Sometimes they say negative when your body doesn't produce a high enough level of hGC (pregnancy hormone). But if it says positive, it's finding plenty of hGC - you're pregnant.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	there are no false positives darling.<br>  Congratulations<br>  <br>  God bless x yes its right|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	Even the dollar store brands are accurate.  You are pregnant, but just to confirm you can always take another test that you can get from Walgreen's.|`|Z41F2UcWaa	Sounds like you're prego to me. Most pregnancy tests don't lie but to be sure maybe you should splurge and get one at CVS.|`|HoonZJMgaa	actually one dollar? from where? Try to get a better test or go to the doctor and be tested there.|`|VHi7Kaokaa	yes, your pregnant.<br>  for sure.
HzaVGT2Saa	Move forward.  You have your baby to think about now.  Do not worry about the reactions or nonreactions of others.

You are an adult who is about to have a child.|`|PKyzcW7Faa	You know I have been married for 6 years and when I told my parents that I got engage my mother never congratulated me.

How childish she is.|`|qaoIdRSZaa	awe :( thats not real nice of her,<br>  honestly dont let her get to you, this is your time, so enjoy it!!<br>  Have you tried talking to her? not confronting her so much but ya know just asking her to talk to you and be honest!!<br>  Its ok for her to be envious, but she cant take this out on you, or the baby.<br>  Im sure she will come around :)<br>  good luck and Congratulations :D|`|jswhfzg8aa	I had the same thing, my step mum is a ***** from hell. She has been trying to get my dad to agree to have a child with her for years, he does not want to as it's his time to relax as we (his kids are in or 30's) Anyway, I was working for my dad & step *****, then I found out I was pregnant & she became icy, she didnt congratulate me or even talk to me. In the end, she turned around & said that they would have to let me go from work as they couldn't afford to keep me on anymore, but I know It's because the step ***** couldn't handle work mates talking & fussing about my pregnancy, & I'm sure she wouldn't of been able to handle seeing me get big & pregnant. I hate her now, because she's ruined me & my fathers relationship. I know what you mean. lol|`|qqiVKUBpaa	Chill out. So what if she doesn't congratulate you? It's not the end of the world, so don't let it bother you. You understand why she's having a rough time and that is her deal. She'll congratulate you when she's ready. Maybe she's afraid that she'll burst into tears when she does it and make some big scene and that is why she's putting it off. Just be excited that you're having a baby and try to have a little compassion for a woman who feels like she'll never get to experience being a mom.|`|c5AJGcYcaa	I must ask, how old are you? If you are young, and not "prepared" to have a child (in her eyes) this could be why she has not congratulated you.<br>  <br>  It is very hard on some people who have tried, and who feel that they are more set to have a child than those around them.<br>  <br>  Please don't be too hard on her, sit down and talk to her about it as an adult. This may make all the difference
cnK4X2sZaa	why hasn't your doctor given you a blood test???????|`|xCXyCojGaa	Yes that's right you need a blood test. The home pregnancy tests that I took all came out positive and the pregnancy test that I took at the dr's came out negative.. He then gave me a blood test which concluded with a positive result.
SHXvUSd4aa	stomach does not begin to enlarge until 12-14 weeks of pregnancy, so your symptoms do not mean that you are pregnant. But take a test to be sure.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	Bloating darling.<br>  <br>  At 4 weeks. The uterus is still behind the pubic bone.

If you really want to know, take a test!|`|5p0AW33jaa	if you're due to your period and have not gotten it yet, try taking the pregnancy test to find out. i also felt bloated during the first few weeks of my pregnancy, so i'd say you could be. good luck!|`|HoonZJMgaa	take a test! and do not worry!

Every woman and every pregnancy is different.  I have been pregnant 4 times and never had any breast tenderness nor did my breasts increase in size in any of my pregnancies.  Even when I breast fed I had little breast changes and typically only when I was engorged.  Some women begin to notice breast tenderness or enlarging early in the pregnancy and is their first sign.  Others, are further along in their pregnancy.  Neither you nor your sister will be wrong on your answer as it varies from woman to woman.|`|vfq04nc1aa	Hi...<br>  Its definetly different for each woman. Im 20 weeks pregnant with a pretty petite, skinny frame. My boobs havent really grown a lot yet.

Anyways, maybe that will help.|`|ux6j2OIeaa	She might be overly worried, but some of these symptoms are a lot like pmt.  If she misses her period then get her to take a hpt.  Maybe you should both quit having sex until you are ready for the responsibility of taking care of a baby.
AA12033653	How ever you are comfortable when you are sleeping then that is how you should be.  My doctor told me not to worry about my sleep position, just the sleeping.  You need your sleep.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!<br>  <br>  BTW I am 37 weeks and I still sleep on my stomach!  My doctor said it will not harm the baby at all!|`|ca9dEvSAaa	My doctor said the optimal position is on the left side, however either side is okay.<br>  <br>  I still slept on my back until the belly was so big it was uncomfortable. Now I sleep on both my sides.|`|azE51WGRaa	Usually the doctor will tell you to stop laying on your belly and back after 16 weeks. The most comfortable position (and provides the most blood flow) is on your left side with a pillow in between your legs. Hope this helps.
OOeoFvB6aa	There is a whole lot of misinformation out there about LSD.  One of the oldest myths is that taking LSD will damage your chromosomes and cause you to have a baby with birth defects.  Well, that just doesn't happen.  As much as some people (and posters here) seem to thing that a child with birth defects is just punishment, it isn't the LSD that is going to do that.<br>  <br>  If you're taking LSD while pregnant, you are probably taking other drugs, too, some of which can really hurt the developing fetus.  Alcohol is the most dangerous, followed by cocaine.  IF you're pregnant how and are having trouble stopping using drugs, please go to your doctor and ask for help with this.|`|OUXO6g6Laa	PCP use can have severe effects on the developing brain, though most babies exposed to PCP appear to be born healthy.  Most problems should be apparent from birth.  LSD should be fairly benign assuming there's no damage from uterine contractions.<br>  <br>  Of course, neither has been studied extensively in pregnancy and both should be avoided by pregnant women.|`|AA11909745	This is an incredibly bad thing that you have done...if you have taken either of these drugs and have become pregnant. In essense you are a murderer, or have comitted assault on the child, because if you have not killed the baby you have doomed it to be brain damaged or various other kinds of neurological disorders. In addition, the child will trip out just like you did for years to come because the drug has either altered its brain permnantly or will affect it periodically.|`|0d1b5fcc305ead0ef5c939b96424f4b2aa	Well first of all it can kill the baby and if it's not fortunate enough for that to happen it WILL be born with birth defects and when it's born it will go through withdrawals from the drugs. It's an evil thing to take any drug while pregnant.|`|s5xOMGcbaa	DO NOT TAKE LSD WHILE PREGNANT. It can cause miscarriages. LSD is a uterine constrictor and is very dangerous for your unborn baby.|`|cnK4X2sZaa	**** you.
cnK4X2sZaa	wait till next week.... morning sickness for me started week 8. are you tired? this early is normal for minimal symptoms. and if you saw a heartbeat your doing pretty well so far!<br>  congrats|`|3F8f1SoQaa	With a history like yours it is normal to worry.  With my 3rd pregnancy I had issues like that too. Even before I knew I was pregnant my breasts would hurt from nothing more than a stiff breeze, and certain smells would make me want to puke. I even told my boss at 7 weeks becasue I worked in a restaurant and did not want him to think I had the flu or something if he caught me puking. A week later my breast tenderness was gone along with all my other symptoms. I tried to calm myself for most of a week...but by the end of the week I was hysterical. I called my OB and the nurse had me come in for an US to see the heartbeat. Of course there was a HB and everything was fine....and the baby is now 3 years old!   I would wait a week or so ( I know it is hard) and if you still are not feeling pregnant, call your doctor and ask them to reassure you.|`|0RFUKkBLaa	Try not to worry, my first symptoms was sore boobs i never had nausea or havent craved anything, didnt pee alot, no heartburn or anything just been tired. Im 24 weeks now and had my scan today and babys healthy, so try not to worry too much you could be one of the lucky women like me who have a gud pregnancy|`|BIDy92Dwaa	Hi I know how you are feeling, this is my 2nd pregnancy (my 1ft ended in a misscarage at 8 weeks).<br>  I'd say that if youve seen a good strong heartbeat then the chances of having a miscarrage is very low.<br>  Everyone has their 'good days' and 'bad days' throughout their whole pregnancy. I can see where your coming from with being paranoid about not feeling enough symptoms at times though. Id say as time goes on in your first frimester the symptoms will gradually get stronger, then less towards the end of it....for some people.<br>  All I can say is hang in there and try not to worry unless you have bleeding (I had bleeding in my current-2nd pregnancy for the first 3 months and it scared me to death). But I'm now 28 weeks along with a very healthy and active baby inside me and I'm sure you will too :)<br>  Good luck!|`|35kVNi5oaa	Some ladies have no symptoms at all, try to relax all of the stress you're feeling so is the baby.
pFDu5I3Uaa	Looks like a girl to me :]|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	My girl's ultrasound looks pretty much the same at that stage. I had it confirmed with a 3D one at 34 weeks that eased my fears a bit. I was afraid of the same thing. I now it's hard to tell, things are swollen in there so it can be misleading, but I'd say it is a girl. :]|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	it says girl parts on the u/s YOUR HAVING A GIRL.|`|ux6j2OIeaa	I was told i was having a boy at my 1st ultrasound and Again at my 2nd.  I did have a boy but was still aware that there may have been a mistake so i had a girls name just in case and had only bought a few unisex clothes until he was born.  In my second preg i had identical twin boys and was told boys all along but i still had in the back of my mind it could be girls, it was boys but you just never know.  Unless you've been told 100% (which they don't usually do) i'd be prepared just in case.|`|AA11724307	Sorry but its too hard to tell from that ultrasound what you are having...an actually tech might be able to (as they told you...girl)  but having no background in ultrasound reading....I wouldnt even have known that was the genital region...sorry|`|sbeHyaCqaa	why does it say on the picture 2006? if its 2009 now|`|CVtmd0h3aa	To me it looks like a boy.

I'm sure you could get some medication for it when you see your doctor.
53QQ9KXEaa	Of course men should have an opinion about abortion, seeing as how it's their child too. I just find it unfortunate when the child is wanted by the father and not the mother and the baby is terminated. On the other hand, it's also sad when the baby is wanted by the mother but is talked into abortion by the father.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	I cannot understand why this question even has to be asked.  The man helped create the baby that the woman wants to abort- so of course, the dad should have a say.  For people that tell you it is only the woman's decision, because it is her body- are just living in denial.  The baby has a body all his/her own. A heartbeat all his/her own. etc, etc, etc.  Sex is between two people, that child that the woman is carrying is part of that man, and of course he should have a say.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Why shouldn't they have an opinion on it? They are half of the baby-making equation!|`|vZwJyqc6aa	Yes absolutely they should. The issue of abortion is about morals which some men also have.|`|qN5iVvAFaa	I think they should... i mean it could be them that was never born due to abortion...|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Yea, it takes 2 to tango and I think the law needs to be changed.|`|AA12047432	I think they should not have a say or choose on this matter because it is the women that has to go though with the abortion and what happens to their body. it's not just painful for her body but it's also mentally painful for her.|`|r4E2zXL8aa	I would say yes. I knew a guy a couple years back.. his gf was pregnant with his child and she went behind his back one day with her mom and got an abortion. why? because her mom talked her into it. she never told him, just went and got one while he was at work. it really screwed him up, he broke up with her and he eventually ended his life shortly after that. i felt so bad for him, all he'd ever talk about was that baby he was suppose to have..... he would of loved to have had the chance to of said no to that abortion.|`|YcwMK5Pbaa	Yes, they should, to a point. <br>  <br>  I think that the dad's opinion in the matter does matter, but ultimately it is up to the mother. She is the one carrying the child, and to try to make her stay pregnant when she doesn't want to be isn't right.|`|c5AJGcYcaa	Everyone is entitled to their opinion on any subject. When it comes to abortion yes the man has an opinion it's half his baby as well. Yet at the same time it's ultimately the woman's decision because it's her body.|`|Nl3gv2q1aa	In my opinion, the decision is entirely up to the woman.  Men can express their opinion, but in the end, the woman should make the decision because it's her body and her life.|`|Kbz8XEf9aa	Last time I checked it takes two people to make a baby|`|ypJt6poOaa	yes

It's normal for babies to sleep next to their mother. Once they're no longer babies, most families move their children to their own beds. It's common for toddlers and young children to visit their parents bed in the middle of the night especially after a bad dream or something like that but anything beyond that is abnormal.<br>  <br>  Edit: Looking at both your questions together.

There are a lot of genetic factors in determining what a child will look like...you would probably need to go back further in the family tree and map out stuff like eye color, hair color, and skin tone.
jG8b3Mz0aa	Your daughter sounds exactly like my daughter. She'll be 3 in a week, and she's always coming up and giving my husband and I kisses.

However, as another who started her period at the age of 8, I don't know if I would subject my daughter to whatever they are likely going to give her simply for the purpose of delaying a natural process.  You can prevent psychological problems by being a supportive mother and explaining to her that some girls just grow up faster than others.  Eight is not an outrageously young age, though if she's younger than that, my answer might be different.  Maturing faster than her friends is not an excuse to give her potentially harmful hormones or whatever they're going to give her.  The psychological effects of allowing it to proceed naturally is much easier to deal with than giving that kind of stuff to a young girl.  Of course it's your decision between you and your doctor, but I myself would not do it.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i didn't know that was an option.  i was an early bloomer too, as was my mom and grandmother.  i fear that my daughter will be the same way... i know the psychological aspects while your a kid but the other side of that is, your child bearing years can also be shortened when you start so early. (well sorta, but i know both my mom and my grandmother started menopause in their early 40s)<br>  I know my cousins son saw an endocrinologist for a pituitary gland issue.  they have really helped him finally start growing.  <br>  good luck!|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I spoke to an endocrinologist and he told me he has a patient who is 2 and menstruating ..so she HAS to be given growth hormones or she will be a midget ..once puberty hits growing will stop within a few yrs
KOcCenrEaa	I don't like the meaning.<br>  <br>  I think Cameron sounds more like a little boy's name then a  girl.<br>  well does she have a crooked nose? if yes then I guess you picked a  fitting name.|`|8RfmosODaa	lol I didnt know the meaning, its cute I have 2 cousins (one on my moms side and one on my dads) that named their kids that.|`|qitXGd0qaa	She's a cutie and I think Cameron is a pretty name.|`|1s3nddaYaa	i like the name. its cute|`|7uznrLBXaa	Nope.  It's a male name.  My parents gave me a unisex/male name and, 26 years later, I am *still* explaining their decision.  Sorry.|`|D0pQFlMIaa	I can't see the pic too well, but I love Cameron. I especially love it for a boy, but it works well for a girl too. Cammie is a cute nickname option.|`|61NKzPzMaa	Poor little girl. Giving her a boys name. That's terrible.<br>  <br>  No I don't like it. I find it awful that some parents give their daughters BOYS names and give their sons girls names.<br>  <br>  Screams out gender confused!!|`|I8lFqyyFaa	I like Cameron for a boy.  There's nothing wrong with it though.  I'd just have probably named a girl Camille instead and still gone for the same nickname of Cam or Camy|`|nvaGq22Vaa	Very pretty =] i love that name|`|LU96bnCdaa	She is so cute.....<br>  and yes it does fit her.<br>  =]|`|fznvQptlaa	shes cute... cute name for a girl... is her nose crooked?|`|VHHis05Naa	Not a fan of the name on boys or girls, but hate it on girls especially.  It's my nephew's name.  I hate the meaning.|`|4gZYucHMaa	she's beautiful<br>  <br>  I thought to name my son that too (but didn't)<br>  <br>  I don't see a crooked nose on  her, she's a real sweetie--I love the dark hair!
SHXvUSd4aa	it is almost impossible but do not rely on it as a birth control- it has been known to happen (if periods are irregular, if the woman ovulated and had some vagianl spotting which was mistaken for a period<br>  <br>  Please, use a condom at any time!|`|jRqN060Xaa	I dont know, I got pregnant a day before my period started and i still have my period now. an im almost 4 months|`|F8EMQzxfaa	pretty hard. Thats normally when the egg gets discharged. But it is still possible there have been women to get pregnant while on their period.|`|v4a18I67aa	it actually when she ovulate is 2 weeks after her period
azE51WGRaa	With my daughter, she was dropped for almost 2 months before I went into labor and I only went into labor because the doctor stripped my membranes. She was dropped so long that her face came out really bruised because of it. With my son, he's been dropped for almost a month and still no labor despite increase in braxton hicks, increase in energy, losing the mucus plug, and being dilated to 3cm for 3 weeks. Sheesh, you'd think with all that he'd be here by now =D|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Well, I haven't had my baby just yet but mine dropped at 31 weeks as well, I am now nearly 37 with no signs of her making an appearance just yet. So, it could be awhile! :]|`|XaRaP5Ahaa	well im not sure how it was for me because i was so small it was hard to tell when i dropped but my grandma [[and many others] have told me its a week to ten days after you drop! but that could be an old wives tale lol good luck your almost there!
Eo0oeZMTaa	Yikes sounds like she has some issues with him. She prolly feels you love him more than her. Did you make her a video like that? If not theres your reason. If so, then I really dunno whats up. the video is really nice, you have every reason to be proud of it and nothing to be ashamed of.|`|1b40b411fde105efac034d33b5f3fdeeaa	link doesn't work.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	your link doesn't work.|`|4di2FUSUaa	well she has NO right to start parenting u now if she hasnt been there ur whole life
6emxR9pQaa	Ok, first of all, you arent going to be able to tell only after a week and a half. Make sure she isnt playing a game with your head. Has she missed her period yet? Either way, it will be another 3-4 weeks before she may even be able to take a pregnancy test and it show an accurate result. You said the condom did not break, so you are probably fine. If the codom would have broken she can go to the doctor and get "the morning after" pill. My suggeston is that maybe you should take this experience as a sign that you shold be abstaining from sex at such a young age. I am not judging, I am speaking from experience. If you are not ready for a child then you are not ready to have sex, because accidents do happen. No plan is still a plan. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind, pregnancy is not the worst thing that could happen to the two of you.|`|9bPzzoIFaa	a week and a half is way too early for symptoms, if shes really stressed about this, her mind could be causing the symptoms.  your gf should see her doctor to discuss her concerns in about 2 or 3 weeks, any sooner a pregnancy might not be detected on a test.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Not taking the pill properly can cause all these symptoms if she can't keep her pills strait you best keep that condom on|`|5MBdJK4Baa	she has to wait intil she missed her period. but she shouldt even get any symptoms  yet its too early for that|`|HEdGGmkhaa	Don't worry, there is a very slim chance she is pregnant first of all and second of all she wouldn't be experiencing those symptoms that early, it take about 6-12 days for the fetus to implant and then symptoms don't usually come about until a missed period or about 4-6 weeks pregnant.<br>  <br>  If you used a condom and it didn't break, she isn't pregnant|`|EsXe7S1oaa	its probably just being worried about it. ive been there myself. if thats the only time she messed up on her pill you should be fine. she probably wouldnt feel symptoms yet anyways, and by using a condom you had a backup so tell her to try to stop worring about it that only makes it worse.|`|5DwIRQOgaa	do symptoms even show up that fast? Idk... just have her take a pregnancy test. You really should wait til marriage to do anything... then you wouldn't have to worry about it.|`|v4a18I67aa	you should just wait until her period comes
bGRexKPyaa	The plan b pill makes you feel really crappy.<br>  <br>  I took it and got period cramping, stomache pains(sharp)<br>  <br>  For good results you should only take it once or twice a month.<br>  <br>  I took it twice in one month and I am now 8 3/4 months prego!!!<br>  <br>  Doesnt always work girl|`|QXSFpMzDaa	When I took plan B a few years back it took a couple months for my period to get regulated again.  Don't get paranoid it will start.|`|hXNuyTKaaa	Your period is just late. The day after pill is a great thing for girls who are not trying to get pregnant and it is very effective.|`|3CY08tVWaa	You're probably late from the stress you've undergone.<br>  Also, sometimes, if you THINK you're pregnant, horomones can change in your body and you'll be irregular.<br>  Unless you've had an incident prior to Friday where you became pregnant, then the Plan B should have taken effect.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  :]|`|JlG8XgDvaa	Well, the pill does have side effects...those can be common. Even queesiness. Most likely its just stress that changed up your cycle a little. And stressing about being preg is understandable. I think youre ok, but Im no doc.|`|u6jP7BQNaa	With plan b if you don't get your period within a week you could be pregnant.  I would buy a test.  Plan B works pretty well, but sometimes it does fail just like any other birth control method.
cnK4X2sZaa	to early for symptoms.......!!!!!! no you are not pregnant!|`|5MBdJK4Baa	its still to early for any symptoms...just maek an appointment with your doc and get bloodwork done its alot more accurate than the home pregnancy test ..|`|SZAGOYMYaa	Silly lady. Go see doctor.
AMyH091Taa	Hi I am 21 years old and just had my first baby 2 weeks ago.. I would hear people tell me you will know when it happens, but I really didnt believe it because I would feel weird stuff and be like this could be it. Trust me you can feel your cervix dilating.. When it really is .. Like it should be for labor.. You will get contractions.. Contractions feel like the worst period cramps.. They start out kinda normal then get worse. Mine were every 3 mins but I could handle them so I walked around for 45  mins and a hour later I had to lay down and breathe so deep through them.. I took a warm bath helped take the pain away then once I got out had to go to the hospital..I just think you feeling the your body getting prepared for labor.|`|CVtmd0h3aa	When your getting more dilated and effaced it will start to feel like his head is falling out!  LOL!  It gets more sore too!|`|azE51WGRaa	Most women don't actually feel their cervix dilating although that's what you could be feeling. I've never really heard of any pregnant women feeling their cervix dilate but doesn't mean it hasn't happened. Most of the time these pains are just the ligaments surrounding the vagina and in the legs hurting because they're getting looser in preparation for the birth. Good luck and if you're super concerned, go see your dr. Maybe they'll be able to tell you you're dilated enough to have the baby (positive thinking =D )|`|AA11368796	First of all you need to contact your doctor. When I had my first child, I was also around 38 weeks. I started to have pains in my lower abdomen and pressure in my vaginal wall. So it seemed. To be honest, I started to dilateearly in the day but it stayed at 3 cm until 10 minutes before he came out. All I remember is that it almost felt similar to a pap-smear and someone pushing on my cervix. The best way to tell if you are dilating is if you have secreeted a wad of mucus (aka the plug). I'm not a doctor nor do I claim to be, this is just my personal experiance.|`|zRipwNLOaa	im watching for these answers as well, but im dialated and didnt feel much except sometimes it felt like i was getting stabbed "down there" and id jump...lol... sounds gross but thats the only thing i can think of...im 39 wks this thurs. soyea.... when are u due? Im due 3/19|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	Its pressure below. U usually knw wit the help of contractions.
MHeOHOnbaa	30/100|`|JExgGpgyaa	Stupidly low.|`|UQxROBaKaa	not very high
