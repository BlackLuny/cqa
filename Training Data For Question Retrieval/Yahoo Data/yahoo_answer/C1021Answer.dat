Also what kind of message would it have sent to Florida if he left one year after all of his players came back for a repeat championship? His family is happy in Gainsville. Why move to a job with more pressure to win such as Kentucky? In Kentucky, basketball is king. Florida is still a football school. There is not as much pressure to win championships. Plus, Florida now rivals Kentucky as the premiere program in the SEC.|`|011f7b2124c2e874b5315a8cba1f53a3aa	Its not that UK isnt big time anymore, but why would you want to leave the program that you made big, to go to another school where if you lose more then 7 games it is considered a failure.

WfGtcUbJaa	That is always the case. When there is a system that some people deem unfair, like the BCS, there are always going to be whiners and complainers. Some people also just don't want to face the fact that their team wasn't good enough. There will always be jealous fans...<br>  <br>  And as for a USC-Florida game, USC hadn't faced a defense as fast as Florida's. Maybe USC should have done what they needed to do against UCLA.|`|6e876caefced22e716ef988e692571cdaa	Well, actually, USC would have been able to beat Florida.  Think of this.  USC dominated Michigan.  Florida dominated Ohio State.  Michigan lost to Ohio State by only three points, at Ohio State.  Michigan and Ohio State are both pretty even teams.  Since we both dominated our equal opponents, USC and Florida have got to be even teams.  USC would come out on top because they have been to three national championships and a major BCS bowl game in the last four years.  Experience does count for something.  Oh yeah, and you have UCLA to thank, for all three of your national championships.

Es gibt aber auch eltern, die meinen ihre kinder mit 3 oder 4 auf den platz zu schicken... das halte ich aber für verfrüht, da die kleinen noch sehr instabilen k?rper dadurch folgesch?den auftreten lassen k?nnen, die im sp?teren wachstum aufreten k?nnen... (z.b. rückenschmerzen durch verkrümmte wirbel, schulterbeschwerden, knieprobleme). so war es zumindest bei mir... w?re ja gern nen profispieler geworden, musste aber mit 10 jahren aufh?ren zu spielen und habe erst mit 15 wieder angefangen... Au?erdem verlieren kinder in dem alter schnell wieder die lust am tennis und sind auch schneller unkonzentriert.|`|dc3ec4ac7118b2001cc3ef72b92a7b7aaa	Ich würde sagen, da? das v?llig im ermessen der Eltern liegt.

Das w?re vor 2 Jahren nicht denkbar gewesen.|`|b736bdb29cb795e2e4d0bdce3f0379b4aa	also ich finde erst so mit 6 anzufangen ist auch nicht schlecht .<br>  Denn gerade den Aspekt , den mein Vorg?nger gennannt hat , dass einem alles wehtut kann man dadurch umgehen und somit verliert das kind auch nicht die Lust am Tennissport . Au?erdem wird ein 4-j?hriges kind sowieso sehr viele probleme haben überhaupt den Ball zu treffen ...<br>  Beinstellungen und richtige Technik erlernt man sowieso erst ab 10 Jahren und da ist es meiner Meinung nach vollkommen egal ob man nun erst 1 Jahr oder schon 4 jahre spielt. Ich spreche da aus eigener erfahrung ... Meist spielen Kinder die noch nicht so lange dabei sind sogar besser als Kinder die schon 4 Jahre spielen ... Doch im Vordergrund steht natürlich der Spa? !! Und wenn das Kind schon sogar mit 3 Jahren gro?en Spa? am tennis hat ... Wieso nicht ?|`|pzeK4EaNaa	Also je früher desto besser so etwa 4 - 5 Jahre w?hre optimal, aber man sollte dem Kind zu erst Badminton beibringen, denn diese beiden Sportarten sind recht identisch. wenn es dem Kind gef?llt, dann sollten Sie dem Kind eine Probestunde Tennis spendieren. Sicherlich wird die erste stunde Tennis dem Kind nicht gefallen, weil alles weh tun wird, und man schwitzt, aber nach dem dritten mal etwa geht es.<br>  Also wenn das Kind nach der dritten Stunde nicht will ,dann geht es nicht.

Si dejaran de mirar un poco su ombligo y razonen que "su" Marcelo Ríos fue un número 1 sin haber ganado un título de Grand Slam en una época en que el tenis estaba en transición. Traspaso de generaciones por decirlo de alguna manera. No pongo en discusión el gran talento de Ríos, pero le faltó mucho para alcanzar a Guillermo Vilas, sin dudas, el mejor sudamericano de todos los tiempos.<br>  <br>  Vilas logró lo siguiente entre otras cosas:<br>  <br>  *64 títulos (4 de ellos Grand Slam y 1 Copa Masters)<br>  *42 finales<br>  *50 partidos ganados de forma consecutiva en 1977, cortados por el rumano Illie Nastasie (otro grande de verdad).<br>  *Record de títulos ganados en una sola temporada. Fueron 16, en 1977. Récord que ni el mismo Roger aún no pudo batir.<br>  *Tenista sudamericano que más veces venció a números 1. (Disculpen pero la cifra exacta no la recuerdo).<br>  *Tenista sudamericano que más veces venció a top-10. (Tampoco recuerdo esa cifra).<br>  *Virtual número 1 del mundo en 1977 (una mala contabilidad impidió que así sea, siempre nos pasan a nosotros esas cosas).<br>  <br>  Vilas fue un grande de verdad en una época en que todos eran grandes. Competía contra Nastasie, Jimmy Connors, Bjorn Borg, John Mc Enroe, entre tantos otros, y triunfaba. <br>  Me gustaría saber cuales son los números exactos de Ríos que justifiquen que fue más grande que Vilas. Los conozco pero los quiero escuchar salir del teclado de un propio chileno. Reconozcan quien fue el más grande de verdad, no se olviden además que Vilas fomentó el tenis en nuestras tierras, y gracias a él se produjo ese gran impulso.<br>  Ah, luego de Vilas, Ramírez fue el mejor...<br>  Saludos y de una vez por todas chilenitos, reconozcan quien fue el verdadero mito en Sudamérica. No hablen desde la ignorancia y fundamenten bien lo que dicen.<br>  PD: Si no se conforman, les puedo enviar más estadísticas de Willy Vilas.<br>  <br>  En la actualidad, creo que el mejor es Guillermo Ca?as.

AWbYUgR4aa	i rate him 8 out of 10. He's one of the best power forwards in the league, who can shoot short range jumpers efficiently and block shots. I agree, that he's a shorter version of Tim Duncan, where maybe height, and decision making can be elton's downfall in some cases. However, i believe he can be a championship player, however he needs a better team. Basketball is a team sport, and he needs better role players and a better point guard to accomodate him. Look at the Spurs, they have tony, and manu to support Tim Duncan, then they have all these other players who help on Defense (bowen, horry, oberto, elson) and ppl who can step  up on offense. The clippers have maggette who i believe is a great player if he worked on he's shooting and passing. They NEED a point guard. Period. Kaman is promising, however this season, he proved to be nothing but a bust, always in foultrouble. cat mobley is a great player, but he's very hot and cold. Brand is the only consistent player, which doesn't say much for the clippers.|`|fmTqxRvSaa	I do not think you will find a lot of people who dislike Brand.<br>  <br>  I think that you will find that there are probably not a lot of people who knows him.<br>  <br>  I think he is great as a athlete and as a person.|`|a112fa2d0ccf1099eec1119d4da5e902aa	I like him too and I'd rate him 8.5.  I like fundamentally sound players such as Tim Duncan and I think Elton Brand is a smaller version of TD.  I think he's the strongest PF pound for pound.  Great post-up player with a reliable perimeter jumper, strong rebounder and defender.  Had he been 7 feet instead of 6'8", Shaq wouldn't have been MDE and the Clippers would've been the most popular team in L.A.|`|0qNY3BMIaa	Brand is 10 in my book too. He is a regular 20 10 guy, with a couple of block shot  and mid jumper also.<br>  <br>  In my book, hes the most consistent player throughout the NBA.|`|9154f5872324f4dc04da9450db7ad101aa	I'll rate him 8 this season, I'd give him 9 last season because this season he's very slow at giving help on perimeter pick and roll. That's why clippers missed playoff this season.|`|e26e379c5016ba3a08d40ca9508effaeaa	7. He's not an explosive type player. Just an ordinary star player in a bad team like Pau Gasol. No offense though.|`|fUq4WhRLaa	As a spurs fan...I would rate him 7 i kinda like him<br>  <br>  <br>  GO SPURS GO!!!!!!|`|0tfpIxD1aa	Bj Roa is right Brand belongs to a bad team but for me i give him 7.|`|CsVxYXiIaa	9. a good player in bad team.|`|Ps5GopW7aa	tim duncan is a 10. brand is an 8.5. there are a couple of reasons, his height and durability.|`|RWYhUxcWaa	Id give him 8/10.., he can get double-doubles wit his eyes closed but has 2 improve som aspects of his game.., he does have time 2 improve so dont worry .., hes a super playa!!
UVTT6DVWaa	yeah. Russell Martin is way better than paul loduca he can run, hit for power, hit for average, hes defense is better hes a 5 tool player. his also a leader like Paul was.|`|fMGU1QKLaa	He's getting close.|`|3Skh8iaWaa	The Dodgers will never forget Paul LoDuca.  He was the backbone of the team for a number of years.  That's like asking a Braves fan if Tim Hudson made us "forget" Greg Maddux.  Me may have moved on, but we will never forget.|`|LRylMPFuaa	No way, LoDuca was the greatest. He got battered (like all catchers) and kept on going. He was really alert to the base-stealers and often caught them, much more so than Martin. It was a sad day when he left the team. Or rather...when he was traded, since it wasn't his choice.

ViP0jqc6aa	Tricks should not be revealed whether you're a magician or not. <br>  <br>  My advice for you is to purchase Criss' trick or a trick called The Elevator.<br>  <br>  ROFLWAFFLE - Not all levitations deal with strings or wires.|`|cf9c5d3af4b282c2d3c8b4c1904ec5f4aa	A magician never tells their secrets!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Jmx1ygthaa	why is this in wrestling?|`|gIuetF8saa	use really small strings and wires|`|huwgaq15aa	why are you in the wrestling section.|`|uTHoeEpSaa	If you're not using strings or wires, then you're not really performing an illusion you're actually levitating. I'm sure street magicians use some kind of wire system, because it'd be impossible without one. Yeah, you've probably seen someone levitate someone inside a hula hoop, and you're probably convinced that that uses no wires, but my cousin tried a levitation trick like that and the wire went diagonally through the hoop. I think that you should start on simpler magic tricks first, then work your way up to street magic after years and years of experience.

skjO0a2Kaa	Truth be told,  Bobby is the much taller (10-12" at least) than Terry.   While Bobby has won 2 National Championship titles during his tenure at FSU, Terry has only won the honorary title of "Mayor of Munchkin Land."

3e9768577c4d7cc51dc244221c948c23aa	He is definitely improved dramatically in the last few years. It helps that the 49ers now have a quality back to accompany their offense, so now Smith has a better chance to shine as a quarterback.<br>  <br>  Still, the preseason is rarely a good indication of how a quarterback is going to perform. I'm going to wait and see how he does in the regular season before I make any real judgements on him.|`|HxlTayXIaa	He sure kicked *** in college. The right coach, the right scheme, and the right supporting cast....it's possible.|`|3Skh8iaWaa	if you check his stats from his first two years, he made a huge improvement.  He had 1 TD and 15 INT in 2005 and then 16 TD and 16 INT in 2006.  I think the NFC title is a couple of years away, but he will get them there.  As long as he still has DJAX, Battle, Lelie, Davis, and Gore with him the next 3 years, they will be one of the best teams in the league in 2009.  They still need to develop some though, so this year, 10-6 is probably what can be expected.|`|ATer0EQMaa	I think he will surprise a few people this year.  I've never been that sold on him, but he really surprised me last year.  I'll be cheering for him and hope the 49ers do good this year!  I love the young offense they put together and their new defense looks great!|`|gy3umMKeaa	well, he has the tools around him to lead a good offense with gore and vernon davis.<br>  <br>  but, keep in mind, the guy is still only 22.  he had no redshirt year in college and came out a year early.  agewise, this year should technically be his rookie year.  so scratch those first 2 years, and see how he performs from here on out.

w32OBRFAaa	Hai ragione,noi italiani sempre a mettere in ballo i complotti e gli imbrogli,dico una cosa se la Francia vinceva contro la Scozia in casa adesso era già qualificata matematicamente perché ora ha 25 punti e potevano essere 28 con quella vittoria e tutti francesi erano tranquilli.<br>  e poi basta a dipendere dagli altri risultati noi le qualificazioni le dobbiamo centrare da soli,basti pensare al pareggio con la Lituania,quella partita sembrava più una festa per la Coppa Del Mondo conquistata qualche settimana prima che una gara valida per andare agli Europei e tutti avevamo sottovalutato l' avversario si diceva "noi siamo i campioni del mondo ai lituani ce li mangiamo",Lo stesso errore lo stiamo commettendo adesso contro la Scozia perché tutti pensano" se ha perso contro la Georgia noi minimo gli facciamo 3 gol" non ci dimentichiamo che ieri agli scozzesi mancavano 4 o 5 titolari e guai sottovalutarli e poi la Francia ci ha perso tutte e 2 le volte contro la Scozia in queste qualificazioni,quindi altro che complotto questi fanno sul serio!!!|`|F5RgQixHaa	Il pareggio 2-2 di Svezia-Danimarca agli europei 2004 è ben più scandaloso, visto che era l'unico risultato possibile (contando anche il numero di gol) che facesse eliminare l'Italia!|`|HiEvDNYiaa	inanzitutto penso che nessun italiano abbia mia sostenuto questa teoria alla quale tu ti riferisci. cmq rimane il fatto che hai detto delle belle parole, e poi sai che i francesi cercano solo un pretesto x dimenticare la loro sconfitta di berlino. hai davvero ragione è questo il bello del calcio, l'imprevedibilità!!<br>  <br>  viva il calcio, ma sopratutto FORZA NAPOLI!!!!!!|`|IXtJzjFraa	ho visto sia la partita contro la Scozia sia ieri contro la Lituania... la Francia ha giocato entrambe le partite per vincerle, fa un gran gioco ma ha difficoltà a segnare (un pò come il Milan)<br>  <br>  chi ha sostenuto il complotto è un idiota|`|KA1cY7LNaa	Chi ha sostenuto una teoria del genere o lo ha fatto in modo scherzoso o è da internare per incapacità di intendere il calcio.|`|XHRkc3Hxaa	Ma ricordatevi che i francesi sono dei imbroglioni della vità , fanno tutto in modo loro!!! per dire , auguro che l'ucraina vincerà contro la francia cosi loro sarano eliminati... vi spiego in caso di pareggio contro la scozia avremo 24 pts....Scozia 25pts e francia 25pts ....la scozia avrà finito tutte le sue gare quindi sarà fermo a 25pts...per dire in caso di sconfitta della francia e di vittoria nostro contro la feroe che sicuramente faremo il risultato , noi avremo 27 pts , la scozia finirebbe 2e!!!! xche in scontri diretti la scozia ha vinto le due partite contro la francia!!! ecco la cosa!!<br>  <br>  FORZA UCRAINA!!!!!!!!!!!|`|70ba2d206db54b54d86b3a103dc4abc7aa	al complotto francese non credo<br>  ma che una mazzetta sia stata data alla Georgia per dannarsi l'anima con la Scozia e meno con l'Italia il dubbio mi viene|`|lNUOHQbRaa	Il problema dei complotti è che ogni tanto sono veri......<br>  Questo era una grandissima cavolata come avevo gia risposto sull'argomento, pensare che la Francia avesse perso in casa per eliminare l'Italia........ ma quando mai!!!<br>  Complimenti e soprattutto grazie alla Georgia per il favore anche se io penso che andremo a vincere in Scozia....

0XBVbGRKaa	you have a good team; however you are not strong at quarterback nor do you have depth at the receiver position.|`|AA10034577	You have nice RBs your Wrs could use some help.  Charlie Frye...Vanderjagt...did you get your cheat sheet from 2003|`|LEN60u4faa	Drop Vanderjagt and Charlie Frye and pick up some receivers like Brandon Marshall or James Jones or even Jacoby Jones (unless of course theres better receivers out there, these are just some sleepers to name a few).<br>  <br>  I think leinart will be a great QB, one of the best sleepers in fantasy football this year so I dont think you should worry about that too much.  By the end of the year, I think people will be surprised to see him be one of the top 8 QBs.<br>  <br>  Your first 2 RBs are studs, and your other 2 are very risky, but are decent RB3 options.  You need some help at TE, although I'm not sure how since you don't have much to trade.  Maybe owen daniels or randy mcmichael is in the free agency?  Maybe even something like Ben watson or LJ smith, the quiet guys.  If so, pick them up now!<br>  <br>  Great D, nuff said about that<br>  <br>  Decent team, but there are some holes in WR and TE.  But since your RBs are so strong, you'll do fine.<br>  <br>  8/10|`|ZjL8WaJbaa	You have nice Running backs but i think your wide receivers aren't so great|`|jH0zDz1baa	Solid 1 2 running backs.<br>  Solid wide receivers seeing that u drafted running back 1st and 2nd round.   ( or at least i assume u did ) <br>  You did not have a chance at Peyton or Carson by the 3rd round so Leinart is as good as anyone else after Peyton and Carson.    He'll throw for between 3500 and 4000 yards with a chance at a lot of TD passes.
168fd4460d6bc0feec37eb6d01fba5a5aa	You have 2 ways to go in my opinion.  Target Shaun Alexander or Reggie Wayne.  In my opinion Wayne will now be the guy in Indy and he is at the prime age to do so.  If you went this route offer Bulger for Wayne and I am pretty sure he would accept.<br>  <br>  By the way, Bulger is more valuable which I say trade him, but when McNabb is healthy he is at the top.  If you look at his stats before he got hurt last year they were un real (record setting).<br>  <br>  However, if you wanted to upgrade in RB I would package Bulger and Benson for Alexander.  Keep in mind Alexander is  still an absolute stud and in his prime as well.<br>  <br>  Whenever you trade you want to look at the bottom line on your team.<br>  <br>  Reggie Wayne would take either Joe Horn/Mark Clayton/Fred Taylor's spot.  This is a HUGE upgrade.  While there being no downgrade at your QB position.<br>  <br>  Shaun Alexander would take over Cedric Benson's spot, which is probably the same type of upgrade as the Wayne deal while your QB spot stays relatively the same.  Having LT and Alexander in the same backfield seems untouchable.  I recommend going for it, but with either of these two options you are upgrading your team a great deal.|`|LEN60u4faa	I would trade Bulger.  I have no idea how well he can do with Orlando Pace out.  He demonstrated less effectiveness for week 1 whenever Pace got hurt. Mcnabb, although he had a bad week 1, is just getting his feet wet.  Watch him because he will come back with a vengeance next week.  This is what I might do if I were you:<br>  <br>  If you can get Travis Henry for Bulger, do that immediately.  You'll have 3 STRONG RBs and 2 stud receivers.  I would much rather start a RB in the flex than a WR. If that is impossible, add in Jerricho Cotcherry since his 3rd receiver is not that strong, neither is his 3rd RB.  Basically, try and get Henry for as cheap as you can, if you do, your team will be unstoppable.<br>  <br>  (Gates might also be a viable option. Maybe Mcnabb, Graham, Cotch for gates and Plax or reggie.)|`|SrVLQfhGaa	id go mcnabb taylor williams and graham for cutler williams wayne and gates, if he is desperate for a good QB, i like the trade.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS you have a maddd good team from the start, i give you props man|`|6c792f611c50f4ea7b545ffe6296fe39aa	ok so you are trading either McNabb or Bulger (personally I like Bulger better) for either Wayne, Henry or someone else?  If that's the case then I would either go for Alexander, Wayne or Burress.  I think Henry is good but he's not Alexander.  So this guy is going to trade any of these guys for one of your QB's?  If I were you I would dangle a little more in there - maybe Bulger and Fragile Fred?|`|DtqWKfzUaa	sounds like a good trade to me <br>  <br>  (why is  Eli Manning out 4 a month???)
QDxpir9vaa	Keep D.Mason. The Lions have more receivers than the Ravens. So next week S.Mcdonald could be without a reception.|`|LEN60u4faa	Don't think highly of McDonald. He'll be one of those one week wonders you won't hear much from again.  With Roy, Furrey, and Calvin in front of him, he won't do much.  Mason surprised me with his good game this week, and although I'm not sure if he can consistently do this well, I would definitely prefer him over McDonald. Go for it.|`|LsjZJVByaa	How the hell should I know ?  I'm not psychic.  Analyze the team he's on.  Do they pass well ?  Or do they feature the run ?  Is he one of their top two receivers ?  Are they playing a team who is good on pass defense ?  Road or home ?  Losing streak or winning atmosphere ?  These are some of the things you should consider.<br>  <br>  Here you are asking complete strangers to pick your team.  People may answer who are apathetic, or just plain morons who couldn't have an original thought if you jump started their brain.  There are some who would give you a wrong answer just to screw you up.  Is this what you want ?<br>  <br>  You could ask Mrs. Mason.  Check to see if Derrick is feeling OK, is eating well, and is getting his rest.  That makes more sense than asking strangers who don't care.  If you can track her down, at least you'll get an honest answer.<br>  <br>  The fantasy team is YOURS.  Take charge of it and make your own damn decisions.  Making your own decisions is what this is all about.  Maybe some day you'll understand that.
cS5NYP9Qaa	go with Jacksonville|`|TVbKcA9Raa	don't start the texans defense. peyton manning will pick them apart and addai will run right through them. advice: don't start anyone against the colts unless they're baltimore or chicago. then you should start jacksonville.|`|9edf5d40c71316153bd15164c8e8f7a4aa	i'd never start a D vs. the Colts even if you get a kick return for a TD. 9 times of 10 Colts put up enough points to give you negative fantasy points & Manning don't get sacked often NOR does he throw many INTs|`|5T7iWdy4aa	Jax... all the way
yXuqac3Saa	Why in the world do you have 3 defenses...????<br>  Yeah let the Bears go there "D" is in shambles and their offense cant control the clock...... DO NOT LET THE STEELERS GO!!!!|`|WRNJpF6Jaa	Keep the Bears "D", it's the only Offense they have.(LOL)|`|8wKe1y4Xaa	You have 3 of 4 of the best defenses in the NFL.  <br>  <br>  Why?|`|53114ffd162cc9d998fcaf16c22b8ff5aa	Well it all depends on who you can get. The RB needs to have a steady work-load, (No carry sharing) decent yards and tds, but the bears Def is amazing and I wouldn't know if i would give that up.  Defiantly keep the Steelers, try getting a FA if possible by getting rid of MIN def.  but yeah, it all depends on who's available.|`|LpF0AhoIaa	Bears DEF will give you 6 points anytime Hester scores a touchdown. They usually get a lot of fumble recoveries and interceptions as well. So make sure you get great value for the trade...maybe a top 5 RB.<br>  <br>  Ditto for Steelers DEF that has been outstanding all year.<br>  <br>  Vikings DEF might get you a 6-15 ranked RB.|`|cS5NYP9Qaa	Yea!  There's no way that you need 3 defenses unless you need to start 2 of them.  So, go for the trade.|`|h089wNPCaa	Bears defense all the way, they are playing good.
w32OBRFAaa	Questa sconfitta chiude un anno nero per lo sport inglese che inizia dalla finale champions persa dal Liverpool contro il Milan,poi la sconfitta in finale mondiale della nazionale Rugby,la sconfitta in tutti i fronti,sia in pista che nei tribunali della McLaren e del pupillo di casa Hamilton e ora l' eliminazione dall'europeo della nazionale di calcio guidata sempre da un Mclaren (che questo nome porti sfiga!!!).<br>  Comunque hai perfettamente ragione sul fatto degli stranieri nei campionati perché più ce ne sono è più la nazionale di quel campionato è debole e l' Inghilterra ne è la prova non vince un mondiale dal 1966 in casa e meno male che si definiscono i maestri del calcio... (ma anche la Spagna non se la passa bene  mai un mondiale vinto e di stranieri nella Liga ce ne sono moltissimi).quindi l' Inter è un pericolo per la nazionale italiana salviamoci da questa società e boicottiamola tutti e per favore facciamo giocare i calciatori italiani in serie A che sono tra i più forti del mondo!  .|`|1HJnwrChaa	Mitico!Meno 1 anke se fosse arrivata agli europei niente avrebbe fatto....le candidate migliori sono Francia Germania Italia e una tra Spagna Svezia Portogallo|`|4E3Q0yVdaa	è giustissimo quello ke dici, ma io aggiungo un'altra cosa.

Poi viene fuori che hanno trovato sul posto bulloni,manici d'ombrelli e bombe carta ecc ecc.

Tu n'es pas obligé de tout de suite aller où c'est le plus profond, mais au fur et à mesure du gagne quelque centimètre (commence même dans le petit bain si tu es plus rassuré). Ensuite elles doivent aller au fond s'asseoir, courir, se allonger. En fait il faut vraiment se sentir à l'aise dans l'eau  et ainsi c'est plus facile d'apprendre à nager.

But a "cool down" period is required on pistols to allow you to blow off steam if you decide you want to buy a pistol and kill someone, these are effective gun-control methods that don't violate our rights.
1K0fXxMbaa	It takes a lot of practice.  Just keep trying and eventually you will get a good feel for it.  To start, try dropping it with some backspin before you start juggling.  Eventually you will be able to get it up just using you feet.  <br>  <br>  Just keep practicing trying to juggle, and playing the game of soccer, and you'll get that good, clean precise, touch.  Just don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen overnight.  It takes time and patience.|`|25cd367493004c22f4ecd5ac5f3d3d1aaa	Hey man, don't sweat it. I only knew how to juggle a soccer ball with my right foot at first. Then, after two or three weeks I started juggling it with my left foot. What you can do to get better at juggling a soccer ball is that you can try playing a juggling contest with your friends for fun. At least for ten to fifteen minutes every two days. Good luck man!!!|`|6y9Bqok9aa	im 13 my record is 561. i just picture a mini ball inside the big ball and im kicking the mini one. keep you foot level with the ground  hit the ball with you laces.(if your not good then)<br>  to practice pick up the ball toss it to your foot jugle it once then kick it back to your  hands then once you are confortable doin it once do it twice and so on|`|6e9wMh6yaa	Months of practice. You and the ball have to become one. Only then will you juggle it.|`|vtBMKwk9aa	I've been juggling my soccer ball my entire life. If you've just started juggling, then don't feel down if you get about 3-6. When I first started, i could barely do 3. It is extremely hard to master and even more harder if you include all the tricks there are to do while juggling, but just practice every day. Keep you foot firm while tapping the ball into the air and keep the ball on your knees alot to get a higher juggle count.

b8568740e59872f29e957e1ca020af9caa	YES, shouldn't be right that he  be able to just barge into a PPV and get an automatic title shot..<br>  <br>  It makes the rest of the roster look bad, while they are busting their butts and EARNING their spots,  All Cena has to do is kiss Vince's butt and get a main event match for a title shot .|`|2rJwgk40aa	No,because I knew as soon as he came back,Vince would want to put the belt on him.A belt on Cena means more money for wwe.|`|8h5dqzf6aa	alittle |`|MJbfCODqaa	Yes...|`|wm5d9ZEUaa	I'm not mad b/c I don't pay attention to WWE much anymore but I am upset I don't think anyone should ever deserve and automatic title shot upon arrival or return it makes the championship look more like something that is handed to someone as opposed to something that you earn!!!!|`|AA10561904	i seriously don't know what to do with Cena if i was the WWE. i think i would have done the same nonetheless but instead, put Cena in a few months in FCW to make him more technical in the ring before bringing him back!|`|KXmMlqA9aa	Nope not at all he was gonna have the title before but then he got injurdeed and couldnt keep it through the whole match but now he is getting back his shot|`|Z4zStfmVaa	Yes When You Get Injured And Return You Fued With The Dude That Injured You Not Going After The Title|`|310m2T4Daa	YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... first of all HE SUCKS.

Better yet you know he is the only wrestler they would do this with and thats stupid when other wrestler and better wrestlers could use the push like Kennedy when he comes back, are they gonna do a whole 5 minute segement every Friday on smackdown for him and give him a title shot the night he comes back even though he is a better wrestler than Cena, NO and it sucks|`|QouSk1E7aa	Yes, I'm mad, but look at it this way: Chris Jericho got a title shot against Orton last year without working his way up the ladder , and look how long he was out of the WWE at that time (two and a half years). I rest my case.|`|HONZIGfTaa	Yes, <br>  <br>  If he has any fans they would buy the PPV anyway  because its his comeback match, they could put him in the title match a PPV later, they'd make more money that way...<br>  <br>  I hate Cena but Businesswise it would make more sense to do what i wrote above|`|25cd367493004c22f4ecd5ac5f3d3d1aaa	No. Why would I be mad? I mean, Chris Jericho, and everybody else that acts stupid always gets another title shot. Just when they lose it too. The people that are always willing for a title shot never usually get them.|`|yCZuz02Paa	im disappointed that they would decide to give him a shot when theres plenty of others. orton came back and hes not getting a title shot.

2d3c22ce4985a486c431f75390b17331aa	We've killed alot of bears, over bait and more so with hounds...  as for a boar being bigger than a female.. that is true if they are compared equally, meaning a two year old sow, with the same food source compared to a two year old male with the same food.....  But all in all, a 250lb bear is a 250lb bear....  as for shooting over bait, if a bear comes in and isn't acting concerned, if there are cubs, they won't be more than a minute behind the sow... now, if the sow is alittle nervous and conveys that to the cubs, they might hold back alittle... but remember, the cubs when it comes to food, will be like a kid, going to a candy store......  they won't be as cautious as the sow.  When we bait, we normally only do that to bring in the bear, then we turn the hounds loose and let them run with it..... once treed, we have alot of time normally, to exam the bear and decide if it's a taker<br>  <br>  Added: Not trying to take anything away from hunter K... but, really don't agree.  I've killed bear in northern michigan, canada, new mexico and arizona..... we have taken over 25 bears...... cub's won't make much noise until they know it's OK and this OK comes from the sow..... as for run in and then out.... only when something is really wrong. will they do that... normally, we have found that if your doing everything right, when they hit the bait.... they are eating... we have had to yell, scream and throw things at bears that were in the bait, and we were wanting to refill the baskets......  If your really concerned about shooting a sow...then shoot a boar instead.... all you'll have to do, is sit closer to the bait, wait until they turn their back to you... and have really good eyes.... you'll be able to tell is its a boar or a sow|`|SKgeW1w6aa	if you think at all it might be a female with cubs dont shoot at all. i heard that males are bigger and darker if that helps.|`|dz4Ob6WHaa	i have traveled to canada twice on successful bear hunts. usually the cubs will be near the sow because she will not want to leave them alone very long. the cubs will also be making noise and playing around. Watch the bears behavior if they seem on high alert and constantly checking a certain direction chances are there are cubs over there. since you mentioned that you are hunting over bait wait as long as possible because usually that bear will take a tasty morsel out of the pile and retreat and will return for more when they have finished what they previously took. so if you dont take the shot the first time just be patient it will come back. are you rifle or bow hunting
w32OBRFAaa	non aggiungo altro perché hai detto tutto tu,uno può avercela con Galliani e il Milan ma in un funerale bisogna mettere tutto da parte e rispettare il defunto perché è segno di CIVILTà E RISPETTO ,poi credo che a Franco Sensi abbia fatto piacere la presenza di Galliani  che nonostante gli attriti che hanno avuto ha voluto rispettare il suo "collega".<br>  addio Franco Sensi da uno juventino che ti ha sempre stimato perchè devo riconoscere che èpiù di che un presidente sei stato un tifoso per la tua squadra è questo ti rende onore anche se tifo per un altra squadra CIAO.|`|f229d6a7cf47f58ca23f25e7513ba3b9aa	Da milanista galliani non lo posso vedere, ma credo che questo sia un gesto becero e luogo inadatto x manifestare le idee e pensieri, un minimo di rispetto non ce' piu'...ieri era la giornata del presidente.<br>  BUON RIPOSO PRESIDENTE!!!|`|oefArrGRaa	la morte di qualcuno nel calcio toglie la nostra fede calcistica e ci dovrebbe rendere umanamente più sensibili..purtroppo a nn tutti interessa esserlo..|`|KcPhKqYsaa	Galliani è semplicemente andato a rendere omaggio...<br>  che gente...|`|ZQhUNtF8aa	Hai ragione. E' assurdo.|`|6yNWXSYTaa	hai ragione!<br>  E' vero si, ke Galliani ha rubato x anni xò ha un funerale nn si fa così...<br>  <br>  ciao!|`|kXO8Dzf4aa	mi fa piacere vedere un buon 90% di risposte civili e pacate, ma come vedi la tua domanda, che più che altro è uno sfogo, trova la sua spiegazione anche in un sito come questo, che con quello che è successo ieri non centra nulla. Anche qui "qualche imbecille" entra, lascia commenti incivili, dimostra la propria ignoranza e se ne va tra il disgusto della maggior parte dei presenti, ma sicuramente con l'approvazione di qualche altro teppistello che "a galliani, un ladro, gli dovevano sparare". Il calcio sta facendo schifo, io vado allo stadio perchè amo l'Inter, adoro veder il mio capitano, ma non sopporto la mia curva che insulta, la curva ospite che provoca, i giocatori che simulano... questo sport ha perso credibilità dopo gli scandali successi con calciopoli, ma ha perso l'onore e il rispetto da molto prima. Adesso sono certo che gli juventini mi spolliceranno, i curvaioli dell'inter pure, il romanista che sparerebbe a Galliani pure... ecc... |`|nnuHfQ5Iaa	Condivido xfettamente al 100% tutto qll ke hai scritto:<br>  ieri poteva essere benissimo una giornata x rivalutare il nostro calcio, almeno dal punto di vista del NON GIOCATO, ma come al solito, grazie ai soliti imbecilli (xkè è così ke bisogna kiamare qst gente) tutto va in fumo. Parlo da fiorentino, xkè tifo viola, ma in momenti del genere bisogna amalgamarsi l' un con l'altro, senza fare + distinzioni, perchè tutti siamo uomini, tutti soffriamo, e tutti dobbiamo porre dei limiti a noi stessi, sui nostri comportamenti INCIVILI.<br>  L' ADDIO + sincero ad un grande presidente che ha fatto diventare + grande di quanto non lo sia già questa Roma.|`|PCOuJxldaa	Infatti, ma purtroppo la gente così nel mondo c'è, dovrebbero ringraziare Galliani che è venuto da Milano per il funerale di Franco Sensi, ed io che sono tifoso del Napoli mi dispiace molto per lui, poi il fatto di lanciare bottiglie mi sembra proprio che è meglio non parlarne perchè sono atti di vandalismo al 100% è una cosa ridicola. Comunque onore a Franco Sensi.|`|Tqj2TwdEaa	Probabilmente posso darti ragione, è stato un po' troppo lanciare gli oggetti a Galliani. Però bisogna capire anche come si sono sentiti presi per il culo i tifosi della Roma. Comunque Galliani e altre personalità del calcio italiano, che hanno sempre spalato letame addosso a Franco, adesso si ritengono "amici" e "grandi stimatori" del presidente Sensi. Credo che l' incoerenza faccia un po' male...comunque è una persona che è morta, e qualcuno deve pur difendere la sua memoria (magari non lanciando oggetti). DAJE PRESIDENTE!|`|HmMbv7RRaa	sai cosa? che forse quella gente avrà sbagliato pure a comportarsi cosi,però vedi, le persone e  presidenti con la doppia faccia che hanno sputato fango su tutta l asroma e poi si presentano ai funerali di un GRANDISSIMO PRESIDENTE spacciandosi per "grandi amici o grandi stimatori" per me facevano più bella figura a rimanersene a casa,ma sai com'è...le telecamere fanno i miracoli..io spero che oltre a guardare i comportamenti di alcuni soggetti si guardi anche la FALSITà di altri personaggi.. |`|YcGBIyB5aa	Hai ragione, questa cosa è successa in Italia, se succedeva in un altro paese (Inghilterra, Svizzera, Usa) le forze dell'ordine avrebbero provveduto immediatamente a metterli in galera, quelle sono leggi.

uPWinXswaa	jumping ability comes from your core muscles so sit ups and crunches..... also take a cone or something similar and jump back and forth over it|`|fu1ArLwbaa	you can do what the person above me said, which isn't a bad idea, or you could really just jump up and down over and over again, and try jumping on to something that is just slightly higher than your normal jump until you can get up to that, then you can go slightly higher until no matter what you do, you can't get any higher... i don't know how long that would take, but i'm sure anything you do is gonna take a while.|`|dLBXZ7HGaa	practice with ankle weights so you get used to the extra weight and have to work harder to jump then when you remove them you should use the same force causing you to jump higher just pe careful you don't mess up your timing|`|UYTMABFLaa	I would say the very best exercise to do would be power cleans at a gym. If you are doing them correctly, they will help with your explosiveness and also work your leg muscles. <br>  <br>  If you're not interested in cleans, I'd say squats. Not interested in squats? Get JumpSoles. They help a lot and all you really have to do is wear them around the house and they'll help; add their training program and you'll see great results.|`|M03gnMmsaa	Definitely do NOT use ankle weights, no matter what anyone tells you.

PMluTf72aa	i know this will shock a lot of people, but i wouldn't fire Marinelli.  a frequent change of coaches only delays the rebuilding process.  just ask Al Davis.  anyhow, i would trade down from the #1 or #2 overall draft pick Detroit will have to acquire more picks, but remain in the 1st Round.  i would keep the 2nd 1st round pick they got from Dallas.  i would concentrate 2 picks from the 2nd and 3rd round draft selection  on the OL.  i would use the 2 1st Round selections on defense.  i would get LB James Lauranitis from OSU or the LB from USC (Rey Maulega?) and use the 2nd 1st round pick on another top rated LB.  heck, maybe Detroit can get both of those LB's out of blind luck, then transter one to an outside LB like the Packers did with AJ Hawk.  in the 4th round, i believe they have 2 picks, i would draft the 2 most athletic CB's available.  for the remaining picks, i would draft the biggest linemen available to become solid run stuffers.  <br>  <br>  my anticipation is turning the franchise around in 5 years.  2 drafts from now, presuming another high draft pick, i would draft a franchise QB in the 1st Round if Drew Stanton doesn't show promise.|`|y8MI97bAaa	I'd sell 'em.|`|dfeb00a8727feb0b038ed889d65e5c7aaa	Back to the draft.<br>  <br>  They insured themselves at least a half decent draft this year by trading away Roy Williams for about 4 draft picks.|`|a19ce2dc11bcfcbe4ad3e7108e91dab3aa	Definitely sell them, start from scratch and build an expansion team - it's slowly working for Cleveland|`|j8i9IOiJaa	First i would change there name's to the Chickens!!<br>  <br>  Much more fitting!|`|FYwc4pC1aa	i see said the blind man|`|Um59i2H1aa	The bottom line is that the lions need a TOTAL revamping from the top… down. so assume it however you want, but either the owner needs to be hit on the head and woken up, and experience a personality change, or sell them who is committed to winning, including making the hard decisions (not being nice to staff… which is the current problem. Btw, why do you think the Ford Motor company purposely gave the Lions owner a small division of the company so that he could “play w/ it by himself”, and let the REAL, majority of the motor company be run by the descandents who might not have been directly in line, but had better business smarts? Hmm.)<br>  <br>  After the owner, you need to higher a senior exec who knows the game of football, and has connections, and can hire the right people. Someone like Parcells. That type of mentality. That person searches for, and hires either a GM (or can do it himself). They then hire the right head coach and coaching staff. NO, Rod Marinelli is NOT the right answer! He keeps making excuses. He reminds me of the loser at school who continuously accepts beatings from the bullies. He sounds like fricking Eeyore, all glum.<br>  <br>  The mistake the some fans make is that partial reconstruction is acceptable. It’s NOT! Trading Roy willilams for 3 picks is NOT the answer. “Firing” Matt Millen is NOT the answer. These are only PARTS of the answer, but they pale in comparison to changing the owner. It won’t matter who is put in ANY position, because the stupid owner has NO football business savvy, and is as ignorant as he is stubborn.<br>  <br>  So you hire the “right” coach. Someone who has been around the league and can flex to the changing style. You pay him a butt load of $$. You get a staff that complements the style that he wants to implement, provided that the GM or senior VP agrees. You then start drafting players that compliment that style (not just necessarily the highest rated draft player… unless you plan to trade him in a few years after his “stock” goes up). you "trim the fat" (the older players who've just sat around soaking up a salary... trade the ones who have ANY stock left at all, like the Roy Williams') and release the rest, to free up salary for young and hungry players who are willing to prove themselves and earn their salary on a new, reborn / revived team. you give incentives to young players by extending contracts or renegotiating contracts for those who've performed w/ proven results, yet not been a distraction off the playing field (including the bench). you also timely bring in some key free agents w/ leadership abilities to be the "glue" of the team and inspire the younger players. not just money hungry underachievers. you pay them their worth, but don't make long contracts. ensure that they perform before offering extensions. some of the Lions' biggest problems stem from horrible contractual relationships w/ players. they tie their own hands w/ some of the boneheaded contracts that they write, and give bonuses that are totally unwarranted. then later, they can't release them, because of the salary cap penalty. which further prohibits them from bringing in quality players who want to show their skills and are somewhat committed to the team. that's why playing for the Lions is like a cancer. look at how many careers' we've either destroyed or worsened.<br>  <br>  You build your system, and then build upon your successes. At an 0-7 start, even a 3 or 4 win season is an improvement. Then go for 6-10 or 7-9 the next year. The 3rd year go for .500 or better (or more). And look for playoffs by the 4th or 5th years.<br>  <br>  It amazes me how little some lions fans truly understand about the process. I don’t have all of the answers either, but I assure you that after 25+ years of futility, IT ALL STARTS W/ THE OWNER. You can change the nametags of everyone else (and we have), and it won’t change the result.|`|FVbn50lJaa	make them suck so they get 1st draft pick<br>  <br>  draft a good QB first<br>  <br>  hit the Free Agency|`|3fVmIfFvaa	sell them for no more then $50 on ebay

6chLhNJhaa	Gilbert " HABACHI" arenas if he's healthy he can't be stopped. Kobe even said it " GIls the hardest to gaurd in the game" <br>  <br>  Becuase gil has a 3 point shot ( maybe best in the game after peja)<br>  <br>  He gets to the free throw line,<br>  <br>  He can go to the hole when he pleases. <br>  <br>  And if you can remember before he got hurt. He was starting  to pass the ball more, Which i think is great<br>  <br>  If we get Deshawn" i cant feel my face" stevenson to step up we'll be great until gil gets back<br>  <br>  Plus gil is the most clutch PG in the nba.<br>  <br>  I Hope haywood dont come back this year. Javale is better than brendan<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  WIZARDS 4 LIFE|`|ujMsLUcNaa	These 2 PG's are great in their own special way but it also depends on the team you have.  If I had a team with subpar talent and no superstar, I'd pick Gil because he can carry the team with his scoring ability, plus he has the size advantage factor on his side.  If I had a team with some quality pieces then I'd take Paul for his ability to get everyone involved.  If I needed someone to make the last shot, I would take Agent Zero because he seems to thrive on these last second play and has longer range.  <br>  <br>  But overall, the safest choice would be Paul because pure point guards are rare and they are usually the cheese that holds the entire team together.  Paul is a competent scorer in his own right although he doesn't have Arena's range but you can always find great outside shooters to offset his deficiencies.  However, Arenas doesn't possess CP3's pure point guard instincts or distributing skills and you can't make up for that at the point guard position.  Just my 2 cents.|`|LJZCFwNsaa	Chris Paul- he is in double digits every night with assists can get many rebounds for little man and MC what are you talking bout he is not good in scoring he gets at leat 11 assists and 21 points every nite|`|F1xpcJ2Laa	Paul by far. He makes his team better and is the better PG. CP3 is not even in his prime yet and is better than Arenas|`|aNXE5p4iaa	Kobe > Paul > Arenas|`|VwIqgbnfaa	Arenas is a player that can help take over and win a game.  At his best, he's the one you go to when it's 99-99 and it's the Wizards possession with .24 seconds left on the clock.  He's not afraid to take big shots.<br>  <br>  There's one downfall, Arenas chokes on free throws.  I remember one year when it was Cleveland and Washington 7th game post season game.  James gave Arenas a few words before his free throw to tie the game.  Arenas missed them and they were eliminated.<br>  <br>  As for Paul, I think he makes his team better.  He's a team player, he's a play maker and he can get shots and to the foul line when he needs to score.  Paul and Arenas have totally different games.  Arenas is a scorer and Paul's main objective is to dish out to his teammates to get good looks.  Both are great players and franchise players but they both are different types of point guards.  If you need someone to hit big shots and to take over a game, it's Arenas but if you want a distributor that can score when his team can't get into rhythm, it's Chris Paul.<br>  <br>  Arenas has yet to get his team out of the first round and Paul has gotten to the second round in his first post season in the West.  If I were to start a dynasty, I would pick Paul over Arenas.|`|AA11419252	After Last Night I would say Paul. But you said at their best. Hands down ARENAS. Arenas has better rang than Paul. Last year at the end of the season Arenas twice drained 3's at the tip of the half court circle VS. Cleveland. It was when he just got back from his injury. Where they tip off the games, right there, twice one on both side. Arenas is quicker than Paul even though Paul is strong. Driving through the lane. I rather beat someone off the dribble and have the defender ask for help. Than go through a person like Paul does. Paul is good don't get me wrong. But at their best Arenas is my guy.|`|f3yuVVUHaa	Paul has been a double double threat this season. not 10 pts and 10 assts but 20 pts and 10 assts..NBA Record for most consecutive 20 pts and 10 assists. not even the great Oscar Robertson and Magic had done it. at the end of his career he could go down as one of the best point guard ever to play the game. i'd say next to Magic, Robertson, Stockton, Nash, Isiah tThomas and Kidd. remember he hasn't done enough to be one of the best point guard all time. All time great was supposed to earn not given.|`|QJ2fwil9aa	Chris Paul. No doubt. Gilbert and Wade especially are in the mist of career recovery. Chris just keeps getting better and is developing into one of the best PGs in the NBA. Arenas has nothing special to set him aside from everyone else. You've got Paul's passing and control. He brings point gaurds back to the NBA. him and nash are the best PGs out their.|`|5ca155796cc924f908ab89627c371f21aa	I pick Paul. Not only can he not be stopped when he is at his best, he makes average players great. The average players on the Wizards...still average. He is the essence of Point Guardiness.|`|bR5myhajaa	Definetly Paul, He had a double double in every one of his games this year.|`|3teWTOPqaa	Chris Paul is probably better in every factor of the game except scoring.<br>  <br>  I give props to Arenas for being an explosive scorer, but I don't think he is on par to be considered a superstar in this league, and the Wizards actually did fairly well w/o him the last 2 seasons. This season they are struggling because on top of no Arenas, but they are also missing Haywood and his interior defense.<br>  <br>  Jaina: Arenas can average 28ppts, and 28 > 21, it's all simple math my friend.

AA10270018	This is going to be a good fight.

Ricky has improved immensely under Floyd Mayweather and Manny is coming into his world at light welter where he is unbeaten and has rarely looked troubled. True it will be a great fight but I back Hatton's constant punching to wear down Pacquaio for either a late TKO or more likely a UD.|`|NALuet7Zaa	Hatton=lose<br>  <br>  Pacquiao>Hatton=De La Hoya>Marquez>Barrera>Morales<br>  <br>  Mayweather is next, if he's not too big of a chicken selling his stupidA$$ clothing and cd's...|`|74d926bbb467954124e827daf8495652aa	A year ago I would have picked Pacquiao but with Hatton now training under Floyd Mayweather I feel that he has improved immensely and he will shock the world and wear down Manny and stop him somewhere after the 8th round.|`|KUUfGugFaa	Pacqiao probably however if hatton catches him when pac comes in to throw he may stand a chance bu ti i just don't think his reactions are up to it.|`|S6uzPUKhaa	No matter what hatton do he wont emerge as winner c0me fight night. The only one that gave pacquiao problems is Marquez. In a span of 8 weeks, it is impossible for hatton to become that technical. He's a natural brawler. That way of fighting is perfect for Pacquiao. No matter what happens Pacquiao will surprise everyone for his new technique. You cant beat the one God has promised to revive the sweet science!|`|osPstl3jaa	As much as I am a fan of both fighters, Pacquiao would win by TKO at some point. Hatton doesn't have the best footwork and will stand pretty well right in front of Pacquiao. Hatton's defence isn't the best either and I don't think he can match Pacquiao's speed. Remember, SPEED KILLS!!|`|g9r2BLd1aa	Pac would win the fight... He has improved dramatically on his offense and defense... He'll win by knockout by baradges of punches. Hitman won't have an answer for Pac's speed... Pac will also be a briticutioner|`|fiaFQAWWaa	Pac-man. If Hatton can't handle sissy Mayweather, he has no chance against Pac. At least Pac is willing to fight Hatton at 140 where he is good! I think I could beat Hatton at 147 where Mayweather insisted on fighting him!|`|YrrItQQ2aa	PAC - because Hatton's straight-forward style will play right into his style.  Hatton is too stationary.  And Pac is too fast and too strong.  Not a good combination for Hatton.|`|NytiQ9nJaa	ima go with pac hopefully after that he will go against mayweather an lose to him...

We know India's cricket pitch always favoured Spinners . When Kapil dev started playing nobody thought of fast bowling in India's dead pitch. Kapil dev emerged as first bowler we were talking about spinners only. Therefore Anil Kumble may be the highest wicket taker, but considering the overall impact domination in world cricket Kapil dev nikhanj is the all time greatest bowler of India.|`|QD03bB8Aaa	ANIL KUMBLE, without the shadow of a doubt. He achieved what he did in spite of the horrible fielding side that India has been for a long long time. Had Indian fielding been anywhere near the Sri Lankan or Australian levels, Anil would have toppled all world records long ago. Even as it is, he could be unplayable at his best. He suffered because of a large number of dropped catches that ought to have been held, and a number of lbw decisions that ought to have been granted in his favor.

Bedi, Prasanna, Venkatragavan. And during post independence period bowlers like Rangachari, Vinoo Mankad were there. But after 1970s when India started winning test matches and Telecast shown thru Doordarshan, most people started watching Cricket. Any how, the person who came above beating all sort of discouragement is Kapil Dev only. He did made India proud by giving confidence that an Indian can bowl faster like other country men. Kapil maintained his phsique without much injury during his career. So by all means I vote KAPIL as the best bowler even though I like Bedi,Chandra,Prasanna and Venkat.|`|mX5TVUKgaa	Agreed Kumble took more wickets than Kapil did, we must remember in India we have the soil to suit the spinners. Kapil hence has the edge over Kumble. The fact that Kumble took all 10 wickets in an innings shows how he was allowed to exploit the tailor made situations.For Kapil to bowl in India wasnt easy.Hence I feel Kapil was better.

Neua5wxnaa	hai assolutamente ragione è una vergogna, oramai gli arbitri sbagliano troppo e sempre a favore delle grandi e le piccole ke devono fare?

Credo quindi che tutti questi episodi (l'inter di espulsioni nel primo tempo, ultimamente ne ha subite eccome) dimostrino che gli errori non sono così finalizzati a favorire l'inter, si tratta di errori e basta. Uno che vuole favorire una squadra non la lascia in 10 per più di metà gara e non fischia un rigore contro, se vuole favorirla lo fa fino infondo.|`|7tXWq64Oaa	favori all'inter ma se l'empoli segnava su rigore eh???? abbiamo giocato in dieci l'ennesima partita e poi come mai non ha espulso pozzi ???? ed è stata l'inter a far perdere la roma ????

HE PLAYED 2  YEARS IN THE MINORS AND THEN 4 MAJOR LEAGUE SEASONS AND NEVER HIT MORE THAN 27 THEN 45 THE NEXT YEAR HMMM. HE MUST OF BEEN EATING HIS WHEATIES|`|0398d925bbd20ef9754660c21472daeeaa	griffey|`|DXAO0OWAaa	James Loney-Batting average around .300, approximately 15 home runs & 70 RBIs<br>  Delmon Young-.300 average, 12-15 homers, 70-85 RBIs, 10 SBs<br>  Michael Young-Average right around or above .300, 12-15 homers, 80-95 RBIs, 7-10 SBs<br>  Ken Griffey Jr.-.265 average, 25-30 homers, 70-85 RBIs|`|RK4jUtqgaa	Even though his HR total dropped dramatically last season, Michael Young still had a decent year. I look for him to regain his stroke and become one of the top offensive shortstops in the AL again this year.<br>  <br>  Loney has tremendous potential and should hit for good average and power for the Dodgers. I look for numbers around .285/30/85.<br>  <br>  I'm not a huge Delmon Young fan but there's no denying that he can hit. He's capable of 25-30 honeruns and 100 RBI to go along with an average in the .280-.300 range.<br>  Or he may toss his bat at someone and wind up getting suspended.<br>  <br>  The player who used to be Ken Griffey, Jr. is in the twilight of his career. If he stays healthy--and that's a big if--he'll go about .260/25/90. Not great, but not bad for a 39-year-old ex-superstar.

SVWxTi3taa	Coin flip it. You have a glut of RBs, Morris isn't very good, and you'll never start him on non-bye weeks. But dropping Jackson for Meachem won't change much at WR.<br>  <br>  If it was me I'd drop Morris.|`|Kv2kQKn1aa	I'd drop Hightower myself, but between those too I'd say jackson, you have plenty of depth at WR|`|AA10433373	Drop fargas
nz5Q1htwaa	I would do Pittman. I have him starting for me instead of Brian Westbrook who is OUT in week 6. Selvin Young (the main running back for Denver) >>>IS RULED OUT<<<  which means Pittman will have lots of carries plus Pittman's a beast. Defiantly Pittman.
g3fvyqwwaa	That is a great question and tough decision! I have him on my team and I am going to sit him this week because there are a bunch of question marks. Who is the qb this week? Has he had a chance to learn the offense (probably very few plays)? How often will he be on the field and how much will he be a main target?<br>  I say sit him this week and monitor his production. Good luck
1HpOHlR7aa	Sit Addai.  <br>  <br>  Not sure how much playing time he will get.  <br>  <br>  The other three have pretty good match-ups.

If he turns it into a toy spinner, I would probably think it's a little stupid because it's always been a regular title belt. Except the other time when he turned it into a toy spinner, but that was before. Why would you want to change an original belt that's been looking a little different throughtout WWF and WWE?|`|J7264RFraa	Absolutely not! It would be a disgrace to mess up the World Heavyweight Title! its looked that way since it was in WCW! The WWE Title should be changed - I don't even think it spins anymore - I think the middle part is now fixed or at least looks like it doesn't spin! HHH looks a turd with it - he always looked better with the attitude era title if you know which one I mean - the one Mick Foley won! Get the spinner belt out! (cena is great though and these views have nothing to do with his talent or his passion for the business) just bring back the origional belt!|`|QouSk1E7aa	God I hope not.

NQacNeTWaa	Start Hightower. He is a great runningback and has a great matchup against Seattle.|`|CubKN59Taa	T H|`|8da60mEpaa	Saints RB Reggie Bush has been ruled out of Week 11's game at Kansas City as he continues to come back from a torn meniscus suffered in Week 8. He is a candidate to return in Week 12 when the Saints host the Packers on Monday night. With the Chiefs defense missing as many as six starters and the team ranked dead last vs. the run, there is a lot of potential for McAllister to have a big game Sunday at Kansas City. Think of him as a low-end No. 2 Fantasy RB. Welcome to the NFL rookie. After having a breakout game in his first start Week 9, Hightower came back down to the earth Week 10. Now, one bad game is not likely to get him removed from his starting role, but we need to expect a little inconsistency from Hightower. He still remains no worse than a No. 2 Fantasy RB heading into Week 11 against the Seahawks. I think McAllister is the way to go, with Bush out and you just don't know if Hightower and his breakout game and that's all for now.|`|XxzvJfVEaa	McAllister he's better<br>  also check this great offer out:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkhSXcu4OfHCBArYW5RDMF3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081114160757AA70mb7">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|XT94oFf0aa	Deuce
LiPtsZzvaa	It is legal and they will work accuratly up to around 100 yards. use an open choke|`|h2KkiKK3aa	The rifled slugs will work in a smooth bore as long as you use the improved cylinder choke tube that should have been supplied to you, if you don't have a improved cylinder choke tube , just use the gun without a choke, but you'll need to remove fowling from the threads that the choke tubes screw into afterwards. If their sabot or solid slugs, they won't work well at all, then you would have to buy a rifled barrel, about $150.<br>   and slugs are legal in all states.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Yes, No problem, just make sure you are using a improved cylinder choke only for shooting rifled slugs for best accuracy, and performance, and so you don't damage your barrel.* Manufactures recommend you Only shoot rifled slugs out of a smooth bore shotgun with an improved cylinder choke Only.*|`|ABppCRetaa	I also live in upstate ny and i hunt. It is legal. You are able to fire a slug just MAKE SURE you use the right choke tube( Improved modified, modified, improved cylinder, cylinder, and skeet. If you use a full it will get stuck in the tube which will really mess up your barrel and can also hurt you badly.) However, just make sure you do not fire a sabot because it will damage the barrel. Slugs work pretty good but they are not too accurate, especially if your firing it through a smooth bore. |`|SdqDDlvnaa	Since the Mossberg 500 has easily interchangeable barrels, try to obtain the rifle-sighted "slugster" barrel, its a smooth-bore, 24", open-choke ("cylinder") barrel made for shooting conventional, non-sabot, lead slugs, and can be surprisingly accurate, much more so than a vent-rib "bird-barrel".|`|tNyXLcxuaa	Rifled slugs are made for smooth bore barrels.  So you'll be fine.  Throw a scope on her, dial it in and your good close to 100 yards.  Also, most of Upstate NY, you can only use a shotgun, no rifle season.  MOST of Upstate anyway.

Recently, something seems to be missing. Hossa is now a question, and I can't exacty pinpoint what else I think it wrong with them. With that being said, I think they still have a great chance to win, and will be far from surprised if they did. By "something wrong with them" I don't mean that they are now bad. I stil consider them in the top 3 in the league. However, I no longer think they are untouchable. Thankfully haha|`|AA11674745	As much as I admire the Red Wings oragan-i-zation, I'll have doubts if Hossa is affected by this incident in last nights game.|`|MnMkgAscaa	They have as good a chance as anybody.|`|5K0CUSZ1aa	yes, definitely.|`|Jf8LiEw2aa	I do.|`|q5aBmMDCaa	Yes i definitely think they will.

I don't care whether it is always day light saving or regular time, just don't keep changing it.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Yes it is one of my gripes, I even asked a similar question this past week.

I will have to set the clocks and alarms and readjust the body clocks.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	I guess I'm the only one who's going to defend DST.  While the weather is bad, I run in the evening after work.  So while the sun is setting around 6:30 this week, next week I've got till 7:30 before the light starts to go.  That means less rushing before my run to do the things I do when I get home.  By the time the weather warms enough for me to run comfortably in the mornings before work, the days will be long enough that it won't matter.<br>  <br>  I'm all for DST, it was meant to adjust the way daylight hours fit in with the typical work week, and for me it works well.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	I wish they would keep it at Daylight Savings Time all year long.

88a821ff156d404073518f9a8da929c6aa	You have a couple of options.<br>  <br>  You can bet which horses will come 1st and  2nd,or pick the 1st 2nd and 3rd.<br>  <br>  If you pick the 1st and 2nd it is a forecast bet so you would pick 2 horses and say X will come 1st and Y will come second.That is a straight forecast (S/F) and is 1 unit stake.<br>  So you would have put :<br>  Aintree 4.15 .Comply Or Die<br>                     King Johns Castle<br>                     ￡1 Straight forecast.<br>             Total stake  ￡1<br>  If you want to bet that Y may beat X into second then you can cover both eventualities with a reverse (or twist) forecast  (R/F) which is 2 unit stakes as there are 2 eventualities which could see you win.<br>  So:<br>  Aintree 4.15 .Comply Or Die<br>                     King Johns Castle<br>                     ￡1 Reverse forecast.<br>             Total stake  ￡2.<br>  <br>  The payout depends on certain factors but you can get a rough idea by  <br>  treating it like a double on the SP so 7/1 beat a 20/1 last year and the payout to a pound was ￡148.57. If the 20/1 had beaten the 7/1 it would have been more.<br>  You can add more horses,if you pick 3 horses it gives you more chance but becomes 6 bets more than 2 picks is a computer straight forecast (CSF).<br>  So you pick 3 horses and any two must come 1st and 2nd.<br>  Remember ,it costs more and only one of those 6 bets can win.<br>  <br>  <br>  A tricast is pretty much the same bet but picking the 1,2,3.<br>  If you pick 3 horses in the correct order it's 1 bet but if you pick 3 to finish 1st 2nd or 3rd in any order it's 6 bets.<br>  If you pick 4 horses in any order it becomes 24 bets.<br>   <br>  I almost don't want to tell you this but last years tricast paid ￡2268.11.<br>  to a pound stake. (your 4 picks would have cost you ￡24).<br>  <br>  <br>  You can do both the bets on the Tote as an Exacta (Forecast) or Trifecta(Tricast).<br>  As it's a pool bet it may be more or less that a bet on the SPs.<br>  Last years Trifecta paid ￡4664.00 to a ￡1 stake.<br>  <br>  You can of course go with a smaller unit stake.<br>  10p unit stakes(24 bets) last year would have paid ￡466 on the Tricast for a ￡2.40 outlay.<br>  <br>  I hope I've made some kind of sense,if you pick up a Exact and Trifecta slip from  the bookies it will explain more.<br>  <br>  These are VERY hard bets to get in so good luck again!<br>  Ask again if I've not made anything clear.|`|RyZHhI6aaa	Wow, I had no idea that the Europeans don't have Superfectas!  If you were betting on the top 4 horses, then the odds would be really high and you'd get a great payoff.  In the US we have exacta (top 2), trifecta (top 3), and superfecta (top 4) wagering.  But I guess if they don't offer superfectas in Europe, you can't take part.|`|dC4qmz8aaa	You can only do a forecast, that is forecasting the first two horses in any order (reverse or straight forecast), or with 3 horses you could do a tricast either straight or permed, but there are no multiple bets for 4 horses.<br>  <br>  Have a look as this site which will explain it in more detail, and good luck..Jac x<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thebettingline.co.uk/forecast.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebettingline.co.uk/forecast...</a>
0Dm3WEMcaa	So far it seems the only logical step but i'll have to reserve Judgment until i know everyone that's in the match before i give a prediction. Kane is one of the most deserving stars the WWE has but i don't think he would want to take away the opportunity from a younger star to make a name for them self because that is what Kane is like these days. I want him to win but i can't see it happening.|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	i think he will lose|`|sqfjfR3iaa	Kane could challenge for the WWE Championship or the World Heavyweight Title and leave Wrestlemania XXV with one of the two top singles championships. Kane is perfectly capable of beating anyone in the WWF, so it is possible.|`|WQGvE60waa	He deserves a title shot.<br>  <br>  He's worked his butt off a alot more that alot of these WWE Stars getting pushed.<br>  <br>  I remeber when he Debuted.<br>  <br>  He sent chills down the spine when he first debuted|`|PyJ3PMRnaa	What if he didn't.|`|02XHxknUaa	Yeah, I'm praying for that!!!!!!! I really want KANE to win!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|1yOdrYiHaa	Well I See Kane is the best out of the wrestlers who got qualified to the money in the bank so far so i would like to see him winning The Money in the bank , he is talent , great champion and can carry the show , he already was on one of the money in the banks and he really did well , I Would like to see him winning it but i see John Cena getting a match (qualifying for the money in the bank) and win it and go to Wm and win the Money In The bank , Lets just hope to see kane winning it cuz he really deserves it|`|wum4X78maa	No I really don't like you said Kane is getting up in age and he really can't make a formidable champion except for ECW or IC champion. Kane is really not a main eventer and he will probally not win the MITB ladder match but hey stranger things have happened.|`|twpwIBhoaa	I really hope he does and I totally agree with you because he is amazingly agile for his size.<br>  He absolutely deserves that big title push too because he's been so selfless in helping out the younger generation and putting them over.<br>  Go Kane for Mr. MITB 2009!|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	I think that Kane deserves the push, he's put over alot of mid carder and should get at least one meaningful title reign.|`|ca3PsC6Saa	its impossible its sheltons yr|`|ko9Zy9k7aa	I don't think he will win. He doesn't really deserve it. Someone like Mr Kennedy deserves it more, if he's back by then.|`|V4LECaohaa	i hope kane doesnt win it|`|XYOkHeqsaa	i hope|`|T0nwc1CNaa	mark henry and finlay, mvp are gonna lose<br>  <br>  cm punk might not win because of last year<br>  <br>  either shelton benjamin or kane, yeah probably kane. he might get traded to smackdown and then challenge someone, or he will stay in raw, which i hope not|`|CaqdDzQZaa	If Kane won the Money in the Bank it would set up him vs Undertaker one more time|`|2yVRuX0yaa	I agree this is Kanes year i know it is!|`|iPEXvUUCaa	I could see him winning it... but he probably won't
WZGYjD9Qaa	In Guus we trust ^_^<br>  I think that this is a very good move!! I think that he can be the right man for Chelsea!!!!<br>  Because he did very well with teams without great players, like Corea, Australia, Russia, Psv, and now he have also great players in his hand!! So he is a great coach!<br>  Ribery.....Zhirkov.........well... they are very good players, especially Frank Ribery.....!!!! Perfect for Chelsea!<br>  But now, we must think to pass the second leg in the Champions league, after the good result over Juventus. I hope that the guys don't waste the good result gotten in the first leg!!!<br>  c'mon blues!! =)|`|b0d438f69efd90f9889df3c3fd36e870aa	yep mate , i think he's a world class manager , he brings in some kind of confidence to any team  he manages , we saw what he's done with south corean team in 2002 world cup , i think he can be a real aquisition , and then if he can get ribery it's gonna be one of the best transfers in chelsea's history|`|A7QROnjLaa	Sure let Chelsea hoard and ruin more talent. Luckily Man City was unable to do it to the extent Chelsea has.|`|hssKPioAaa	yeah were doing well. but i thourght he was going then cuz his coaching russia for the world cup....??? i might be wrong|`|g2QUNwZzaa	i might need more than 2 games to decide if i like hiddink. sure he was good with russia, korea, netherlands and such.... but scolari was good with brazil and portugal.... good coaches dont necessarly = right fit for da bloos
RLoilwCNaa	All around game, it's not even close. Lebron is better.|`|y8qGjcZyaa	Didn't take you seriously since you stated "Lebron is a better inside scorer."  If you watched a video of KB24 on NBA.com a few weeks ago, it would describe why people think Kobe is not as good as Lebron- he takes shots that other players wouldn't dare of. <br>  <br>  And:<br>  WHY DO LEBRON FANS DENY THAT KOBE IS A BETTER PLAYER THAN LEBRON|`|Ez0z7Of3aa	They just don't believe it. they know the LeBron is a great player but they are Kobe fans after all so they'll support KB24. <br>  It's really hard to compare them because their style of play is kind of different. Kobe is a shoot over the defender type of guy while LeBron is an attack the basket guy.|`|67EaIAvbaa	i don't think neither one of them really care..they get paid!|`|L66IcsuUaa	I don't deny Lebron is better. He's amazing. Of course, he'll get MVP. Right now he's playing better than Kobe. But the Finals is a ??? for Lebron... The Cavs will get there.... But Lakers are too strong.<br>  <br>  Edit:Fans deny it because Lebron said Kobe is the best himself... Maybe Lebron fans deny it because either they think Lebron is the better player or Kobe said Lebron was better himself.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Kobe passes like 100 times a day, and you forgot his teammates are unselfish too!|`|ISQAWUf2aa	You know those "stuff that you listed" are not all real kobe is way better shooter and he proved that he also passes a lot just cause you didnt get an assist doesnt mean you didnt pass.Defense:Kobe is way better and makes it look better by jum up and inercepting the pass i dont see lebron do that.Lebron himself said that kobe is better.In the olympics.<br>  <br>  Edit:Lebron is a great player though but kobe is better.When lebron will have his 13 seasons then determine whos better okay?|`|1oj4aamaaa	Because Nate Robinson rules.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Because they want people to think Kobe is the best, which he isn't!
93e1ff606f85ccabe51449c8266f3ce2aa	Absolutely!<br>  <br>  "Ever" is a long time.<br>  <br>  All Wayne's records will be broke too.<br>  <br>  Will it happen in the next 5-10 years? - It's doubtful.<br>  <br>  Goals are meant to be reached and records are meant to be broken. We live in a world full of people constantly muttering "I never thought I'd see the day." <br>  <br>  If you and I were guaranteed to live 100 more years - I would bet you, or anyone else, anything you/they wanted. Anything!<br>  <br>  Yep - It will happen.<br>  <br>  This is coming from a realist and a hustler (not a gambler)|`|9ujT56Maaa	Doubtful, unless the league starts contracting teams.  <br>  <br>  Talent dillusion has affected everything.  It's easier to score a goal when your linemates are immensely capable threats that keep the defence and the goalie from focusing entirely on you.  Yes, the defencive talent is dilluted to some degree as well, but its far more noticable on the offensive end.|`|uDv0cgvzaa	I think Ovechkin is most likely the only player with the dynamics to reach the feat. As you can see this year, he started a little slow but has since picked up his play. If he can put in a full 82 games, he can easily pop a goal a game, never mind 2 or 3 every once in a while.<br>  Kovalchuk may be the only other player with the dynamic all around play to reach 100, but he doesn't have the right attitude. Ovy plays to have fun, Kovalchuk is too much business.|`|shVgCizBaa	It is very unlikely unless NHL changes the rule on the size of the goalie protective equipments  but nothing is impossible.A. Ovechkin s is presently the leader with 46 goals after 65 games.The regular season has 82 games.|`|muOxoDGOaa	It could happen, who knows! Some big star could pop outta nowhere (like Wayne Gretzky!)|`|ULw1777caa	No, will never happen.|`|HJuOSvmdaa	It will only happen if there are some serious rule changes like some people have mentioned.  Especially size of goalie pads.<br>  <br>  Or until aliens are allowed to join the NHL/genetically altered super-humans are allowed to join the NHL.  Lol|`|AA11051192	I think with the skills and superb training that younger hockey players are bringing into the NHL, it will be an impossibility to reach 100 goals in an 82 game schedule. I also think Ovechkin has the best chance to do it, but the game has just gotten so much harder for that to happen between the spread of talent, new skilled goalkeepers, and bolstering defensemen coming up through the ranks, that I believe it will never be accomplished unless the season expands.|`|AA12172407	Yes. <br>  When? certainly in the next 20 years. Remember, the NHL's current state of the game philosophy is geared toward more goals per game = fan excitement. The rules are changing and players are faster...it is bound to happen.|`|UADHt07Zaa	It will be when they decide to make the nets bigger to inflate scoring.|`|Jf8LiEw2aa	No, I don't. If it does happen, it will be a result of a rule change that hopefully will never happen.
mUG8XtNpaa	The Cardinals will re-sign Boldin. The team just reached the Super Bowl last year and with a returning Kurt Warner, why mess up the team chemistry and put it at such a high risk?<br>  <br>  I see a desperate team and/or one really in need of a WR signing him. Fitzgerald and Breaston were both 1,000 yard receivers last year, so even if Boldin did leave, the Cardinals still wouldn't really need him.|`|HtYGxZcCaa	No, they already have Boldin and Fitzgerald. They should try to get Boldin back hes younger and doesnt drop passes like TO does. Boldin fits better into the Cardinals system, and although lately there may be constroversy between him and Arizona he definately wont be the locker room cancer that TO is. If I was any team Id stay away from TO, esp. when you already have 2 young pro bowl recievers|`|wUooHVU3aa	If that happens, the Cards will return to obscurity. Their locker room and team chemistry from 08-09 will be destroyed. If they are wise, they will re-sign Boldin or draft a receiver to replace him. Leave T.O. to writing children's books and looking at himself in the 32 mirrors in his mansion.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Forget about trading Boldin... go for TO anyway. With Fitz and TO on the edges, and Boldin in the slot, Warner and the Arizona passing game would be unstoppable... no defense in the league (not even Pittsburgh) could account for that. <br>  <br>  Never will happen though.|`|1Yal1pOkaa	Boldin has to be traded to leave, but if boldin leaves obviously to would be thenext best choice to help draw double teams away from fitz.|`|p8ahZa8iaa	No, Breaston would be an adequate replacement as the #2 WR if they lost Boldin.|`|acaAycEXaa	You must really hate the Cardinals!|`|f13c61e5eac8be2f275c050b8cdb9a2aaa	for that guy to say hes a better reciever is retarded.|`|HRP3PIl9aa	t.o. needs to fix his repetation,with his teams publicly,an the teams mates trusted that in the time of pressure that he can control his criticism toward them,,,though i play semi-pro an i an game press to win that after it makes the urge to won worst,,if u lose an u think someone didnt is showing an weak link,,,or ur not being used to your full playing ability,to play ..u have to put your self in his shoes sometimes but,,still in order to make an decision,to u have to look at the history,,,the cardinals have good chemistry,i dont think they want to test him in there organization....|`|ULw1777caa	No, take Boldin back.  He is younger and a better receiver.|`|XLXncQu9aa	I think it would be good for the Cardinals offense.  If the Cardinals let Boldin go they would need another reciever to fill that void.  I think T.O. would do well offensively, but in all honesty,I think T.O. is suffering because he did it to himself.  I think T.O. being signed onto another team would be his last chance.  He's used up his chances with the exception of this last one.  I think T.O. would help the Cardinals offense because he is a great receiver and has proven to be that over his career, but his problem is his conduct and attitude. If Boldin doesn't get signed the Cardinals better take their chance quickly.|`|707802d08077ed6fa1e3d68133b4a34eaa	bad news for Terrell is that the cards don't need him, it that the cards are more spread out, there's to much young talent in Arizonia to worry about a 5th reciever like Owens...He'd be better off going to vikes or bears, were they haven't had much of a recieving threat.|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	I don't see it happening. TO will probably end up on the Raiders or Redskins. The move is too risky for the Cardinals, but I think TO + Fitz + Warner could break a lot of passing records.|`|wxXguyK3aa	If Boldin doesn't come back, Arizona will not be as good as they were last year.  They would definitely need a good WR to take his place.|`|VNpZPjZ3aa	Who wants that headache

1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	The last time I went up there we went to Lac Seul.  It has everything you are looking for and more.  Sioux Lookout is the closest town but we never made it there.  The English River runs into and through it and it's chalk full of walleye, northern, big muskie and really nice smallies.  We also caught a bunch of sauger and perch.  I can't remember the name of the resort we stayed at but it was nice.  We had 6 or 7 of us in one cabin.  We fished on Vaughn Lake quite a bit, it's part of the chain, and literally were catching 20 walleye an hour per person.  It was post spawn and they really had the feed bag on in the 10' to 12' sandy flats.  We basically just used a hook with a leech and a split shot about a 1 1/2' above it.  Try to go up in early July, my buddy is always up there for the 4th, because that's when they have recovered from spawning and are really active.  We stayed somewhere on the southern side of the flowage and did not target anything other than walleye.  We still caught plenty of northern and smallmouth.  I have heard that it is one of the finest fisheries for muskie that there is.  You go through International Falls and around Rainy Lake some but it won't be that far of a trip for you.  Good luck!|`|VuVLNNU3aa	I have never been, but I have heard great reviews about Lake Of The Woods.

Ir7JA6IUaa	You know, it really depends on the resort and how big the bunny hill is.  Where I learned, the bunny slope is considered a green run as it is big enough to have a quad lift, and they get you on that right away when you are taking lessons.  My first day, I went down the true beginner slope about six times before I went on to the next green run that's longer and steeper. But, some places have a really small almost flat section that they start you on with just a carpet lift, then they move you up to a beginner slope with a lift.  Once you learn how to control your speed by turning effectively, and can stop without using a wedge, you can typically give the harder slopes a go.<br>  <br>  I really don't think most people go on the bunny slope one time and then hit harder runs.  You have to learn a lot before being competent enough to actually ski down a slope and not just do wedge turns and hope you can stop at the bottom.  It takes practice, so take your time, learn the basics, and progress at your own speed.|`|OrG2fBbKaa	Typically the bunny slopes and the green circle slopes are grouped as the same. They are the easiest runs at that area.  There is no definition just a relative difficulty rating for that area.  Not all of the runs are marked with green, blue or black designations. Some like the "Magic Carpets" and handle pull are always the easier slopes. Most of my students who have never skied before, will spend about an hour on the carpet before we ride the beginner chair.  This gives access to much longer runs that are about the same difficulty as the carpet. As soon as we can get away from the carpet we can ski a longer run and have less time on the lifts and in the lift lines, hence you get more skiing time. The bunny slopes are green circle runs and that's where you start. Take lessons from a qualified professional and have fun.|`|k1C70y8raa	It varies depending on how well you take to the sport.  I know people who have gone straight to a green, struggled half way down and the second run made it down fine.  I coached this season and I taught a college girl who spent her entire 2 hour lesson going down the bunny slope in an excess of 10 times.  Once you feel comfortable enough to try something a little bigger, go for it.  The steepness of the green is also very similar to that of the bunny slope so its not a big transition.  The only difference is that you are going to have to ski a lot longer, so your going to be exhausted at the bottom.  The best way to not get tired is to relax.  A lot of people tense up their muscles and they tire themselves out!  Skiing is fun, soak in the beauty of the area, relax, and have fun!  Good luck, and don't ever let someone push you into something you arent comfortable with.|`|qyATAaeXaa	Everyone has given excellent answers. <br>  <br>  You go on to the next level slope when you feel you are ready to do so, provided you know how to control your speed by using a snowplow and can come to a complete stop. <br>  <br>  Once my students could do that I took them on a longer Green run so they had more distance to practice turning. Sometimes they would get it in an hour, sometimes two. One woman I tried to teach nailed the stopping and slowing techniques on her second run down the beginner hill, but was afraid to move on to a longer slope. I think she was afraid of the heights and didn't want to go on the chair, but we stayed on the beginner hill with the magic carpet for 2 hours. <br>  <br>  Go when you are ready.

cTuaFrYiaa	BSA Sportsman Rifle<br>  <br>  Notes: This is a basic bolt-action design, produced from 1947-55. It is a development of the BSA No. 1 Rimfire Rifle, but meant for civilians instead of the military, and has a much longer barrel. The Sportsman Five is a variant which is magazine-fed. The Sportsman Ten and Sportsman Fifteen are also magazine-fed, but they are fed by under-barrel tubular magazines. The Supersport Five had an enclosed bolt, tangent-leaf rear sights, a better extractor, and a far better stock; it also had a much shorter barrel. The Century 22 was based on the Supersport Five, but had a 26-inch heavy barrel, a target-type stock with a contoured pistol grip, and a large handguard.

hWvvrEphaa	Hey. I'm really sorry about your sons dirtbike. It's frustrating to know there are people out there who will steal things instead of saving the money to buy it themselves. The same thing happened to my boyfriend. He always put his dirtbike his the garage and then one night he didn't, and it was stolen...while we were awake. He filed a police report but nothing came back until 6 months later. The bike had been bought and sold 3 times and the motor was gone. They caught the guy stealing all the bikes. He's in jail now for 12 years....not just for theft but for attempted murder. Scary huh?<br>  <br>  My advice to you is the same thing my boyfriend done. Put an ad out pretending to me someone else and say you're looking for 'this kind of bike' (your sons bike). When you get phone calls pretend as if you dont know much about bike and do not bring up that your sons bike was stolen. Check out the bike and if the bike ends up being yours tell the person you're interested in the bike and go home and call the police. Also be sure that you ask for a bill of sale...if he doesn't have it then thats another reason to suspect. Even if the guy selling it isn't the person who stole it the cops will track him down and with any luck you'll get the bike back. The only reason my boyfriend didn't get his back was because the guy who stole it was very very slick...like a professional con...and even then, they found him a few months later. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck to you and the little guy.|`|b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	How big a bike is this as some household insurance will cover a motorbike if the report states that it was under 49cc.  So if it was a little 50cc you could get it written up as 49cc and claim under household insurance depending upon the company.  But really transporting bikes you should always get an unbreakable chain and chain the bikes as well as otherwise it is too easy to steal them.|`|iPoH6tsnaa	You can go up to the local DMV and ask for the info...it may cost ten bucks or something like that.

fhpVPVuhaa	I'd like to see something similar to the NAB Cup that the AFL Runs. A bit of prize money on offer. Play the games at quality country locations that takes the game all over. They use to have it a few years ago. I think Souths one the last one.|`|3lrXg6heaa	Well a preseason competition would be good for the supporters of the game as they could see their team play more times in a year. But it is not very good for the players like you said, they can get injured and could miss out on the whole regular season. I think Trial matches are better as it lets them get prepared for the season without the pressure of a compettion|`|um6aZbcyaa	I would rather have trials and a few injuries than have no trials and a lack lustre season opening because none of the players are match fit.<br>  <br>  as for a similar comp to the NAB cup I don't think it would work, The AFL treat this comp as a joke changing rules not using top line players I honestly don't understand why NAB sponsers such a joke of a comp.I think a similar comp in the NRL would have a simlar result and be a laughing stock like the NAB Cup|`|Xh4Evef0aa	if your thinking maybe a pre premiership type of thing, maybe a rugby 7's type comp would be good. <br>  i'd go see it.<br>  but if something like that went ahead, maybe the main season would need to be shortened. i dunno. haha|`|4eQqTiYwaa	Id say a pre premiershit comp ,<br>  <br>  i remember a few years back they had a sevens comp . maybe they could bring that back or just make it a real comp|`|f9hiPMDxaa	Trials as they are now are not worth playing. In the old days it was a way to improve fitness. Today's players should not need this.<br>  <br>  An alternative would be a pre season comp like the NBA pre season in AFL. We used to have the Wills Cup pre season comp.<br>  <br>  The major problem with both of these is injuries to players.|`|1ykzSRtKaa	There should defantly be some form of preseason trial. Whether its a NAB cup type tounament of just a round robin, injuries are just a party of professional sport.|`|Uyz6iZwKaa	No. It is needed to get the teams up to scratch before the season starts. No one is forced to play ... if a coach doesn't want to risk a player then he could always put someone from a lower grade up for a bit of experience. If a team doesn't want to risk any of its players than let them put a 2nd grade team in or just not take part. I am sure that the majority of teams find the trials are essential in establishing a team for the season. Whats to stop a player who gets hurt in a trial from getting hurt round one - it is the same difference. Atleast after the trial there is a few weeks to start recovering from the injury without missing games. <br>  <br>  A prize would mean that teams that may want to give some young blokes a trial would not want to risk losing from their inexperience - instead just keeping one full team. The point of having trials is try different combinations and give players a chance to prove themselves etc.<br>  <br>  That's my 2 bobs worth.|`|HTulGtABaa	Yeah I was watching this discussion on PTI the other night, I dont think they should have the trial matches, if so make it one before the season not 3.... Russ was saying that in the Knights v Sharks trial, like 8 players were injured, and for what, to see how the team goes that isnt even the team that will play through the season. Its a big risk for the players, every year teams get players injured in trials and weaken their team drastically for the first parts of the season. Its stupid. Hope it gets sorted by next year|`|mber3JoAaa	I like the idea of the the pre-premiership trophy. I think it should be a knock-out competition in a similar format to the Challenge Cup in England. A four week competition before the start of the NRL (so league can compete against the early rounds of the Super 14) would be good for the game.<br>  <br>  However I only consider this to be an option if both the English board and the NRL/ARL develop the brains to shift the World Club Challenge to the end of the season.|`|CZvrFqZ1aa	Trials, they're a necessary evil. You have to work on combinations and things like that, and it's good to get in some match practice too.
DpfJfK6Baa	I think the reason you're finding it difficult to get it up is the pressure of the neighbours watching you.  Do you have a semi?  Why don't you try round the back but mind and no damage that bush.<br>  <br>  Maybe you just need to get a man in to do the job.|`|rfCGWFNcaa	lmao.....well well well Deano......cant get it up,christ what with me and me partial sight..(they always said youl go blind)....we make a fine pair of old stiffies............i wonder all though years ago Pele after making escape to victory.. thought to himself..Mmm next up il do a cant get a stiffy advert..thatl make em all stand to attention theyl never forget me...and to think Pele translated is limp in english!|`|HayuYYTYaa	It was standing very proud last time i looked...not as tall as i would of liked it ...but it does the job..hahaha x|`|v0P0vay0aa	lol|`|zDJVWlscaa	<a href="http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/img/facepalm.jpeg" rel="nofollow">http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/img...</a><br>  <a href="http://seiryuulostmymusic.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/facepalm.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://seiryuulostmymusic.files.wordpres...</a><br>  <a href="http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/6/68/Notagain5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/...</a><br>  <a href="http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/3/3f/Facepalmhomer.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/...</a><br>  <a href="http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/b/ba/Sadjesus.png" rel="nofollow">http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/...</a><br>  <a href="http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/e/e8/Pope_facepalm.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/...</a>|`|ngzpa9CIaa	once seen a Scaffolding firm with satisfaction guaranteed with every erection on their vans.... maybe this mob can help you<br>  ...<a href="http://www.allfunnypictures.com/pages/erection.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.allfunnypictures.com/pages/er...</a>|`|V1RsWiAAaa	soft luck go ta the doctors<br>  or get 1 of thees for his birthday and hope he does no fall in love with it|`|z8jYprWkaa	That was very nearly funny.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Nearly<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  But not quite<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In fact, not at all.|`|HpaajWMKaa	my hubbi has erection problims 2 his frend helps him get it up it stands a bit bendii|`|lYkvps54aa	lol, join the gang.|`|bADza5pRaa	damn I hate it when my fence fails to erect|`|57edf00d97af522b314c33475bf1e853aa	My man had the same problem,debbie was at the rescue tho,lubricate it with oil,rub very gently then slip it into the hole..then it'll stand proudly.|`|MPqO1Qayaa	you should by the fences that are a guaranteed 'stonner'...

3m9DQuDRaa	Marty Wright was released for two reasons.  They didn't believe his character was headed anywhere, and was only available for shock value...  and because Wright started his career way too late in life, causing his learning to be severly stunted, so he doesn't have enough skills to really put on a solid match.<br>  <br>  As for your second question...  The wellness policy is the WWE's program to fight against steroids and the like.  The rules are, first offense, 30-day suspension.  Second offense, 60-day suspension.  Third offense, 90-day suspension followed by a possible release from contract.  Another part of the wellness policy is the federation releasing you of your contract if they suspect drug addiction, and will pay for your rehab.  It's for the safety of the other wrestlers in the federation.|`|fdfff8c684452fdac81ea48fc5937290aa	Boogyman was released due to cutbacks, just like every other company in the world.  The wellness program has to do with drug testing.  They do random drug testing with each superstar.  The first positive comes with a 30 day suspension.  The second is 60 days and the third is termination.  <br>  <br>  All of this became more noticable after Chris Benoit died.  They are being watched very closely and they have to keep up with the drug testing to make sure they don't end up on the Senate floor with a hearing.|`|wum4X78maa	Well I'm not really sure about The Boogeyman but it was probally because he wasn't a Main Eventer and wasn't a high card talent either and they were trying to save money in this bad econemy. And the Wellness Program is the drug testing program and William Regal was suspended for Performance Enhancing Drugs AKA Steroids.|`|D5cOFZdwaa	beats the crap outa me about the boogeyman but william regal was suspended for testing positive for pot and who knows what else AGAIN|`|9eyu5oaiaa	Contrary to popular belief, Boogyman was release because he is, as the Babylonians would have called him... "crap"|`|V4LECaohaa	because he sucks and no one likes him|`|jJrIf427aa	well ness is health,drugs broken body etc|`|EUyUVJMxaa	he had too much boogers yo and no napkins|`|gML6hbYFaa	I thought he just lost to Kane this week.|`|2FKHNIB2aa	The wellness program is set up by WWE as a drug test thing to make shure the superstars are not using illegal substances, so if he was suspended for this he was using steroids or drugs of some sort.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Stale character and probably situations in the locker room that we'll never hear about. He did have issues on fitness and working to progress the character over the years.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	Because the boogeyman was a limited gimmick that no one really cared about until he got released and now everyone gives a crap.<br>  <br>  William Regal has been suspended for testing positive for something, the wellness policy is the WWE's drug testing plan to catch wrestlers on steroids or anything like that and regal has already been suspended for steroids once, 30 days last year so it looks like he has been tested positive again.|`|bLhTwPqIaa	What everyone else has said that his gimmick gets stale and its hard to do storylines for someone like that especially on ECW or it could be that he is too scary for the PG Era and too many Mommy's were phonning WWE and complaining they're 6 year old gets scared watching him and he should be taken off air, sorry felt like a little ramble there.<br>  <br>  I did not know about Regal, thanks for the info|`|NRs72Afxaa	The economic crises has gave Wwe no choice but to cut their wrestlers. I think Wwe released Boogeyman because they had nothing left for him to do, and plus his gimmick is stale.|`|gfxXikenaa	He was a creepy annoying and useless wrestler anyway.
Z5xgSATSaa	The guide pulley is the upper pulley that guides the chain from one sprocket to the next, the tension pulley is the lower pulley that maintains spring tension on the chain. The upper pulley's bearing allows a bit of side to side movement of the chain to allow it to self center itself on the cassette sprockets.

No longer are they a team that can score only one one two goals.<br>  3. They get back a rejuvenated Martin Brodeur. They're no longer going in to the play offs with a goalie who's played 70+ games.

TAPBWPJLaa	What do you mean?<br>  <br>  Did you not see Judgment Day last year when she lifted Melina and Mickie James at once for a Canadian Backbreaker? Do you not find the submissions she pulls off as impressive, especially since she outweighs most of the other Divas by just 20-30 pounds? And to be realistic, the Divas are not half her size most of the time, but more like half her skill level, and Mickie James has had a lot of time to shine in comparison to other Divas.<br>  <br>  Also, you have to look at which Divas are on which show. Natalya is not on RAW, and in my opinion, Natalya gets overrated a lot simply because of her last name. Granted, she is better than the "models" WWE picks up, but in comparison to the females who can actually wrestle a good match, I don't see Natalya on the top of the chain like most claim.|`|2FKHNIB2aa	I never get board of watching Beth destroy those crappy models who cant wrestle.|`|EAZv468Xaa	I don't think she's annoying.

aLcGuGVNaa	I believe he should be reinstated, but he should be on a short leash.  It will be interesting to see what team will sign him.  Five teams have already stated, quite bluntly, that they are not interested in Mike Vick - Buccaneers, Lions, Seahawks, Jets, and 49ers.<br>  <br>  And the Cowboys aren't cursed, their problem is they have Jerry Jones as an owner/ceo/gm/assistant coach/thirdstringqb/backuppunter/#1DCFAN...  The problem is Jerry Jones loves the Cowboys too much.  He's a fan, and fans don't always think rationally.|`|fyY0D7IGaa	Yes Michael Vick should play football again, big deal that he killed a few dogs-------there just dogs, hunters kill animals every year and its not big whoop.

People act as if Vick killed a human, everyone just needs to realize he made a mistake and he is sorry and move on from it, i mean you don't have to like the guy just stop going on about it.|`|0fc4be2c7fe0b3251308b8c4479f2d3baa	Actually they have NOT said anything about him being aloud to come back.  On the contrary, their is speculation from the league office that Goodell intends of suspending him at least a year, when and if he applies for reinstatement.<br>  <br>  With that said, I think he should get to play right away.  He did the crime but he did the time.  What more do you want?<br>  <br>  I'd like to see him in Cleveland playing for the Browns in front of the Dawg-Pound!  That would be hilarious.<br>  <br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .<br>  .And I agree...the Vikings don't want Vick.  They traded for Sage Rosenfels!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!|`|XwXuJIF8aa	No look at this Pete Rose only gambled and is not allowed to participate in baseball. The other one killed animals for sport. He should be breaking rocks in jail for a long long time. <br>  He is an embarassment and has no right to play fball again.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	if he has paid his debt to society and has served any reasonable suspension that Roger Goddell sets forth, than he should be allowed to play (albeit on a short leash, as others said).  everybody deserves a second chance, after all.
p3rnyBoYaa	Take a look at the scoring rules to the league you are in. Also, if it is available check out data from last year in your league. Also check to see if you have to fill a roster with each position as that will change how you want to draft.<br>  <br>  The league that I am in scores more points for hitters (head to head only) so I draft heavy for hitters, try to grab one ace and supplement pitchers later in the draft. Because you have a 50% rotisserie league, pitching may be balanced with hitting in your league. <br>  <br>  With the 5th pick in your draft, you get the last of the big five and that works fine. If Santana or Lincecum comes back to you in round 2 you may want to grab that ace.<br>  <br>  Good luck during your draft.|`|BKg7030Iaa	I would say that good starters are a little more important in head to head than roto. I wouldn't put off drafting 1 or 2 starters as late as you are planning. <br>  <br>  Also, your plan on making an early run at closers may not be as successful as you think. Everyone is going after good closers earliest this year. It might actually be easier to get some good starters than good closers.

ys3DHzDuaa	Yea, i would agree with Brandon Roy.  He's led all rookies in minutes, points and assists this season and has shown how much more refined a player you are if you stay in school and pick up some college experience.<br>  <br>  As for runner up, you'd have to give it to Rudy Gay.  He's recorded 4 double doubles this year and has been one of the few bright spots for a horrid Grizzlies team.|`|1b19a5ae9aeaae9afda4450a0ede52e2aa	Yes! he's been the best rookie this year.|`|3aizzHR6aa	No he shouldnt the number 1 pick Andrea Bargani Should his team is winning and he is doing good i dont care if he got injured.|`|4cV0yPxwaa	This year their hasn't been a stand out rookie like the past years... but he's ok i would give it to him since Adam Morrison isn't that good either.<br>  Last year Chris Paul was outstanding and shined, or like other rookies of the year this year it isn't that big of a deal.|`|qFyTLo6uaa	He should.

Umaga went back and forth between his opponents, knocking them down with ease. Carlito and Kennedy ended up on the floor as Umaga cleared the ring.

Rey Mysterio came out wearing silver pants and mask, and silver body paint covering his chest, arms and back. Wow, they didn't do a very good paint job, as it looks like someone applied silver suntan lotion and forgot to rub it all in. Rey is a lot less toned than he used to be as well. They went nose to nose at the bell and shoved each other. There was a "Chavo Sucks" chant. Chavo went for a leg, but Rey stepped away from him before he could grab it. Rey took Chavo down with a legsweep, and they went for a test of strength on the mat.

King Booker says Rey had a triumphant return, a fairy tale dream come true. But HHH will have a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions. HHH shall have a grand entrance and the people will cheer, and I want HHH to take that moment in. That will be the only good thing, because HHH will have bowed down to King Booker! <br>  <br>  Divas Battle Royal <br>  Maria, Beth Phoenix, Melina, Jillian Hall, Mickie James, Torrie Wilson, Victoria, Kristal, Michelle McCool, Layla, Brooks, Kelly Kelly <br>  <br>  First Candice Michelle makes her way to the ring to observe. <br>  <br>  Candice Michelle came out to ringside to watch the match. She has new theme music. The Divas in the match are Maria, Beth Phoenix, Melina, Jillian Hall, Mickie James, Torrie Wilson, Victoria, Kristal, Michelle McCool, Kelly Kelly, Brooke and Layla. Everyone went right at it, and the rules were that both feet had to touch the floor to be eliminated, no over the top rule. Brooke was the first to go out, and actually went over the top rope. Jillian Hall knocked Maria off the apron with a shoulderblock to eliminate her. Melina flung Layla between the ropes to eliminate her. A lot of generic brawling and struggles by the ropes, but no big spots to speak of. Kristal kicked Victoria between the ropes to eliminate her. Mickie James put Kristal on the apron. Michelle McCool knocked Kristal to the floor in what looked to be a poorly timed attempt at an "accidental" punch. Kelly Kelly was tossed out by several women. Mickie James tried to rana Jillian Hall to the floor, but they got caught in the ropes. Torrie knocked Jillian to the floor, then Melina knocked James to the floor. <br>  <br>  It was down to Torrie, Melina, Beth Phoenix and Michelle McCool. Michelle and Torrie teamed up and eliminated Melina. Torrie and Michelle double clotheslined Phoenix. Phoenix survived the double team and flung Torrie through the ropes and to the floor. Michelle and Phoenix went at it, with Michelle hitting a few shots, but Phoenix just lifting Michelle and easily depositing her over the top rope to get the win seven minute mark. <br>  <br>  Winner and NEW #1 Contender: Beth Phoenix <br>  <br>  The Aftermath: <br>  <br>  After the match, MVP came out with two guys carrying a cooler. On the mic, MVP said no came to see the divas, they came to see the U.S. champion. He said in his day, he would drink beer, but now he drinks the best beverages. But tonight, he is going to lower himself to a beer drinking contest, and challenges Matt Hardy. <br>  <br>  Outcomes Hardy. Hardy cut a promo, said he a normal guy, and proud of it. Matt said he knows he can beat him in a drinking contest, but he won't try. Hardy brings up the SNME boxing match. He said MVP brought in a sub (Holyfield), so tonight, he has a sub for the drinking contest... Outcomes... Stone Cold Steve Austin! <br>  <br>  Austin had a toast with Austin before leaving. Austin then "warmed up" with some push-ups and jumping jacks. Austin handed MVP and beer, and they were about to drink, when Austin kicked MVP in the gut and gave him a stunner. With MVP laid out, Austin then had a beer bash in the ring. <br>  <br>  Backstage: <br>  <br>  Theodore R. Long was pleased with Austin besting MVP, while McMahon, Coachman and Regal were ticked off. Cryme Tyme came in, and said one of them might be Vince's son, noting they like to make money, just like Vince. Long and Coach joined Cryme Tyme in the "Money, Money" dance. Regal even joined in on the fun eventually. Ron Simmons appeared in front of the dancing Regal and said .... Damn! <br>  <br>  Kat DeLuna, who did the Summerslam theme song, was shown at ringside. <br>  <br>  ECW World Championship <br>  John Morrison vs. CM Punk <br>  <br>  Punk grabbed a double leg takedown at the bell and Morrison squirmed out from under him.

The screen fades to black and the Triple H return promo plays. Suddenly we hear.. “ARE YOU REAAADYY??” Fireworks hit! The King of Kings beginning, but then we are back to the old “Time to play the game” music. Here is Triple H and a huge ovation. Triple H then start posing, so let's say about 10 minutes to introduce both of them. Triple H looked in great shape, but not freakishly muscular. <br>  <br>  We are finally ready to start. <br>  <br>  Booker kicked Triple H in the gut at the bell, but Triple H fired off some right hands and clotheslined him over the top rope and to the floor. Booker regrouped, but when he stepped back into the center of the ring, Triple H hit some punches and whipped Booker across the ring. Triple H ran into a Booker elbow.

Vince spat and complained about the taste in his mouth. Coach offered him a Tic-tac. Vince suddenly realized he liked the taste, and said that Mae had turned him on. Coach said that was disgusting, and Vince said "Old chickens make good chicken soup". <br>  <br>  Jim Ross announced that there were 17,441 fans in attendance at the Continental Airlines Arena tonight. <br>  <br>  A video package on the John Cena-Randy Orton feud was shown. <br>  <br>  WWE Championship <br>  John Cena vs. Randy Orton <br>  <br>  Randy Orton introduced first, then Cena follows under tons of boos. <br>  <br>  The belt is raised up and we have a bell.

6928d4a45c2fbbb75a871b505b3d5f4eaa	Only reason is because Seattle generally had a huge sports maniac climate. As the Sonics got worse, attendance was worse. OKC is gonna have the Supersonics, and I am cool with that cuz they will have some fans and stuff in the beggining, but lemme tell you this, unless they get better the fanbase will decline.<br>  For ex. Washington Nationals of Baseball.<br>  Because of the new stadium, it was sold out on the first day. because of their suckiness (lemme tell you they are really sucky to continiuosly lose to the Giants) their fanbase declined automatically.<br>  <br>  Durant may help take this team out of this stage, but who knows.<br>  If you guys are gonna be loyal fans then I am very happy for this Sonics organization and you OKC people.<br>  I hope you guys do well and I wish you all the best.|`|ZsEU7Pw8aa	I was impress with the number of fans that came to watch the Hornets played in OKC.

I definitely support the idea of an NBA team in OKC, very passionate fans.  <br>  <br>  -Laker fan-|`|fJc3TaCAaa	The NBA is basing fan support on season ticket sales.Season tickets start off at $1,500 at the United Center not to mention you would have to be able to make it to fortyone games a year.Now in the magical world of homos like Clay Bennett every basketball fan can shell out $1,500 at least and have no responsibilities that would prevent them from attending fortyone games a year.Now in reality people have jobs and can't come home at midnight or one a.m. three or four nights a week.There are also people that can't afford to pay for season tickets but they still watch every single game their team plays.But that doesn't count as fan support of course.Real fans buy luxury boxes and buy team memorabilia at auctions.<br>  <br>  Clay Bennett alone didn't do anything wrong and I really don't think he's a bad person.The NBA just doesn't care about its fans that aren't willing to spend money.Their whole idea about what a fan is is wrong and its excluding alot of people.I'll go to probably ten games this year and sit around with a bunch of assholes that don't know **** about basketball but they pay the price of admission.
ypmGKy5Aaa	Here's the five-team trade:<br>  Miami gets: Antoine Walker (From Celtics); Andre Emmett, Jason Williams, and James Posey (From Grizzlies); draft rights of Robert Duanas (From Hornets)<br>  <br>  Boston gets: Curtis Borchardt (From Utah); Qyntel Woods (From Miami); draft rights to Albert Miralles (From Unknown); 2 second round draft picks and money<br>  <br>  Memphis gets: Eddie Jones (From Heat); Raul Lopez (From Utah)<br>  <br>  New Orleans gets: Rasual Butler (From Heat); Kirk Snyder (From Utah)<br>  <br>  Utah gets: Greg Ostertag (From Memphis)<br>  <br>  <br>  I also think that the Miami-L.A. trade for Shaq was one of the bigger ones, considering how Odom and Butler have turned out.

This will make you multi-dimensional.  Your running game is setting up the pass but there is not a great passer.  You have no idea of what kind of receiving core you have because there is no one to deliver the ball....You only score 17.8 points a game.|`|E9i15g59aa	Because they think since they have one of the best running backs in the league they can focus their game else where....they throw way more than they should and they don't build their running game as much.

They should NEVER trade peterson because he has the potential to be the next LT, but they really need to get their **** together and USE peterson well. |`|WUvTZS2Zaa	Only one reason: Tavaris Jackson, the QB.

qyATAaeXaa	Wider skis will always turn better than the narrow ones. Something like a Karhu 10th Mountain or a Fischer Outbound Crown will turn better than a Rossignol BC series ski. The larger sidecut gives you more surface area to engage the edges. You don't really have to sacrifice much speed at all. Instead you are gaining control. With thinner skis you lose control unless you have a bomb-proof technique. <br>  <br>  That's only part of the game though. You also need a powerful boot and binding to drive a backcountry ski. You need at least an NNN-BC binding and a higher boot. I've found the run-of-the-mill NNN boots don't cut it, at least when beginning. A 3-pin binding with a cable will give you a bit more stability. You can always stick with this (as a lot of people do) or eventually switch to a shorter boot with an NNN-BC binding later on once you get the turns down and have conquered any balance issues as well.<br>  <br>  Stick with it and you'll learn the turns. Then you go to a lift-serviced resort and rock the bumps on a set of double-cambered planks and look like a hero!
DrgEoVAUaa	Any kind of golf club named after a supposed "fierce" animal is most likely not a good club.

DLxh9CANaa	The reason this is the case is because the geldings are stronger than the mares- and because they are gelded, they are much more tractable and calm than the mares would be. The wagons these teams pull are HEAVY- they can weigh as much as 5 tons in some cases. It takes a LOT of strength to be able to pull that much weight, and do it with the style and class which people expect to see. Clydesdale mares just simply don't have that strength, at least most of them don't. Plus, a lot of the mares which are owned by this particular company's stud are used as broodmares, which precludes their being able to work on the hitch teams, for obvious reasons.|`|38cc8157846426266baa6afc6d5ab186aa	Well, the female would be called a mare :)<br>  <br>  i remember reading a book where a Clydesdale mare came in...i think she was very sweet and stuff.

AA11056614	Recognize there is no such thing as a good $200 bike. <br>  <br>  That said, you would be better to look for a better grade older bike ... a 3-4 year old $400-$500 bike should be readily available for your budget point .. and if you pick right probably not need more than a tune-up and few replacement parts (common wear items include: brake pads, chain, chainrings, rear cogs, tires). <br>  <br>  Note that more expensive bikes have superior components that stand up to use much better ... so assuming you find a lightly used bike at a garage sale, sale notices at a bike shop or on Craigslist / Kijiji you will be far happier than a budget department store special. <br>  <br>  Just make sure you know how to assess the fit (see the link for a guide) and buy accordingly. While greater adjustments than possible with existing components can be made by swapping components that can get expensive ... so look for a bike that fits "as is".<br>  <br>  In terms of brand, any name brand like Trek, Cannondate, GT, etc is a good bet .. but note that most companies sell higher end and budget models, so it's more the type of components that count than the brand. Look for alloy rims, and name brand (e.g. Shimano) components. Weight of the frame isn't that important .. but look for CrMo if steel, or aluminum alloy (or carbon if you can find it) over "carbon" steel.   Plan on a hardtail (not full suspension) MB or even a hybrid (for street/hard trail use a hybrid can be a great choice).|`|JSGLKnA4aa	none! i advise people to spend a min 450.00. at this level you actually get something worth using and maintaining.|`|PvV0aNvfaa	you can get one from "Leroy" you can catch him in the "Hood"|`|0qJ68C4taa	Check out Craigslist. I just got a great GT outpost off of there in great condition for only $60. New this bike is around $350 depending on where you buy it. Make sure you know the brand is reputable. I would not recommend a Schwinn or mongoose due to the fact that both of these are department store bikes. Definitely stay away from any bike that says full or dual suspension unless it is more expensive than $900. The reason for this being that a full suspension bike for under $900 is just going to be a lot heavier than you need for riding in the street. Brands that are good are GT, Giant, Trek, Specialized, Cannondale, and Gary Fisher. These are all going to be great bikes. Before you buy though make sure you test ride it and check the brakes and switch through all the gears to make sure that the bike works good. Good luck

You can take the time to type this question, but not go to UFC.com?<br>  <br>  Anyway, Georges St. Pierre won in dominating fashion, beating BJ Penn to a fairly bloody mess. Between rounds 4 and 5, the fight was called by the referee as a TKO.<br>  <br>  To address the Vaseline incident, there is some definite opinion on what happened, and nearly everyone will be biased toward the fighter they like most. But here are the facts; Chuck Liddell saw that GSP's trainer had not wiped his hands off after applying Vaseline to GSP's face (as is customary in any fight), and began to massage GSP's shoulders and upper back. Chuck informed the Athletic commission, who stepped into the Octagon right away and inspected the matter. According to the Commission, they wiped off GSP's neck and shoulders and informed the trainer of the issue. In my opinion, the issue was settled right there in ring.<br>  <br>  I'll admit I was rooting for GSP, but the performance given showed very little evidence that there was anything illegal going on. Penn's game was very poor, his take-down defense awful, and energy level non-existent.|`|TGCpExqYaa	Penn could've had brass knuckles on and a prison shank, and GSP would've still beat him down.

It is not based on its value as a sport,but how many viewers or money it can earn.<br>  Women have earned less because the value of their product is not equal to the men's product.<br>  It doesn't matter how many sets they play the only thing that matters is how many dollars the producers make.|`|dKi2R2oHaa	They may play less sets, but it can take them much longer to finish each one.  <br>  <br>  Honestly, I don't care as long as they are not getting any public money.

TMB4d3FAaa	You can box up out of your weight division,just not down. That's why you will see people holding belts in several divisions.  Sugar Ray Robinson did it when the weights were further apart. He maintained his weight and boxed heavier opponents. Rocky Marciano barely weighed 180. That was a near normal weight then.  Ali went up to heavyweight after winning the Olympic Gold.  Even the puny heavyweights are close to 220 now. With the training, speed and endurance most light heavy weights will  devastate all but a miracle fighter from a lower division..  Some cruiserwieghts hold their own for a little while. Imagine a little guy of 180 or 190 going up against a Klitchko today? They separate the weights to reduce injuries as well as get more gates. With the continuing upward weight of super fighters, I expect a super heavy weight division to soon appear.  There is just too much weight differences in the heavy weight division right now.|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	at that time heavyweight was 190 and up until they changed it to 200+. tyson never weighed less that 210 for a fight. his opponeants did occasionally. in the 80's heavyweight was 190+|`|a112fa2d0ccf1099eec1119d4da5e902aa	There is such a weight division called CRUISERWEIGHT which is 190 lbs.  If you weigh in at 188, then you're within the cruiserweight limit.  If you exceed 190 by a pound, e.g. 191 or 195, then you're already a heavy.  Remember, Roy Jones Jr. fought Ruiz for the heavyweight title weighing in at less than 200 lbs.|`|0da6ab3c6b462dc6d34ee0177bdc0459aa	Its called Light Heavy.  After years later he becames a Heavy Weight fighter but he was 210 lbs and above.
hMkb7H31aa	Here's some tips I've learned from collecting autographed baseballs:<br>  1.  Use ONLY a BLUE ballpoint pen - preferably BIC.  Have several with you - they sometimes don't get returned or you may misplace one.  Make sure ink is flowing before handing to player.  <br>  2.  If he is a player you recognize and you have a fresh ball - ask him to sign on the sweet spot.  Sweet spot is usually reserved for the manager - Bobby Cox of Braves. <br>  3.  Unless you are trying to get as many signatures as possible on one ball, have other balls with you.<br>  4.   Spring training has many players you never heard of and probably never will again.  If you don''t know who the player is, you may not want his autograph on your ball.  It's Quality - not Quantity.<br>  5.  Again, know who is signing the ball - players' signatures are not always legible and later you won't have a clue who signed.<br>  6.  Be polite - always say Please and Thank You.  Players are not obligated to sign anything - except their multi-million $ dollar contracts.<br>  7.  Refer to the players as Mr. _________.  Never "Hey You" or "Can you sign my ball?"<br>  8.  Let the ink dry - do not rub your fingers over the ball.  <br>  9.  Place the ball back into its box in between signings.<br>  10. Buy Official Major League baseballs for autographs - in case you score some great signatures, they will be worth more than a Little League stamped ball. <br>  11.Buy plastic Ball Cubes to store your signed balls for display. <br>  <br>  Have fun.  Remember you may not always get the player's signature you want - be patient - the next one could be even better.|`|GwawzO5Faa	Have them sing in blue or black ink. Sharpie pens tend to clump and run at times and the signature often looks sloppy.<br>  <br>  Also have them sign on the sweet spot of the ball if you can.|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	Ball point pen w/ BLUE ink.

khU8m4gxaa	He shouldn't turn heel now, for the same reasons you gave. But to say he can NEVER be a heel is not true. He does get booed by a decent part of the crowd. But he could very easily turn heel sometime down the road, he's been an effective one before, but I wouldn't expect it anytime soon. Even Hulk Hogan became a hated heel. I've heard it said, that to truly hate someone, you had to have loved them before.|`|09YK9Zboaa	Cena as a heel vs. Triple H actually wouldnt be such a bad match up, even though Triple H is better as a heel.  I dont understand why you dont want to see Cena v Triple H, they are easily two of the top names the company has to offer.  Cena can go heel easily and he should but he is not going to be heel with a movie on the way, after the movie comes out he will go heel|`|b1bb1949f6bd80a6b260437ca822b177aa	never covers a long time.  there was a time when people said that hogan could "never be truly a heel."  well, he did, and he still moved t-shirts.|`|w2nMrQzwaa	you say the fans wouldn't boo hi when he's heel, but 50% boo him even now as a face...|`|TAPBWPJLaa	Merchandise sales mean nothing, to be honest.<br>  <br>  If WWE truly wanted to turn him heel, they could do that at any moment. Look at Stone Cold Steve Austin. He was one of WWE's top names in terms of merchandise during his years around, especially with new t-shirts every other week and the smoking skull championship belt design, yet he turned 100% heel on more than one occasion. <br>  <br>  One of the problems right now, in my opinion, is that WWE doesn't really have many people that can play a good main-event face, and a lot of the main-event faces  are hated by people as is. Otherwise, John Cena turning heel wouldn't be a problem if someone else could be a major face over him (and I'm not talking a veteran).|`|w8d3qHNtaa	its easy to see that every child is to stubborn to see Cena is a HORRIBLE wrestler and RUINED wwe by attracting kids, in which case WWE made their programming more family orientated and took out the girls kissing, playboy shoots, soft-core porn diva magazine covers, bikini contests, extreme ECW violince, Extreme Expose, and more|`|eoNlLXLSaa	Well the WWF officials should know that he gets booed all the time and a lot of fans like cheering for the bad guys anyways...especially when they face Cena.|`|vuyrIfiuaa	Cena is heel right now to us 12+ year olds|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	agree with you
AyHo8rnKaa	well like I said even when Barca was 12 points on top, you never know what can happen and Madrid is a great team and can manage somehow to catch us. but I still believe Barca has the best chance. even if they are under pressure, they are still the one to lead the title race so without a doubt, Real Madrid is under pressure as well. <br>  lately, we lost Abidal, and puyol has not quite played as well and the demon inside V.Valdes woke up. and we haven't been as sharp in attack either. the reason why we are not winning is not just one player, the whole team just hasn't been the same, but some players have been worse than others.|`|p1kmZziVaa	How are you gonna make fun of Milan in the UEFA??<br>  <br>  You're team is gonna be in it next season so start getting ready for that. <br>  <br>  And, of course Barca will win the season. Arsenal - 5th place <br>  Besides, you guys  couldnt beat Spurs, the team you call $hitty.<br>  <br>  <br>  .......So?? And I accept that. I don't call them a crap team. I like Espanyol.<br>  <br>  Wait, Im not a Barca fan lmao <br>  I like the team thats on top of the EPL :D|`|Wv0UKUdiaa	We were close as 3 points to Real Madrid last season and we were 3rd at the end of the season and 17 points behind them..... I'm sure we will win it because we deserve it but I won't cry if we don't.... after all this is Pep's first season!!!!|`|kbIHYS5xaa	Absolutelly.. if we dont win it ill bark till i lose my voice.<br>  <br>  None is responsible.. im sure that 2 of them were for betters anyway like every team does!<br>  <br>  In last 3 years we won CL Marky.. you didnt do that in your whole history lol|`|vpZJ6rZzaa	Eh.. Barcelona may win the La Liga. Arsenal won't win the Premier League. Simple as that.|`|WdOAxQmoaa	also who's responsible for barca's lack of trophies in past 3 years?|`|vwTu8fY7aa	Depends on how far that they go in the UEFA champions league|`|jLRpCt03aa	Dude our Fifa battalion is eating you alive I wont even add anything except to say next time you come a-hunting at least have the courtesy to put on a nicer avatar goshhh!

We just took a little stumble, but we will recover that magic we had in the beginning.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	They should be more confident than Arsenal should be of reaching 4th. If that is not the case either Barca fans are idiots or Arsenal fans are a delusional bunch. I accept some exceptions as I know my Q is general coz I can't speak for all fans of either team.<br>  <br>  Edit: Yeah it is crap to be out of UEFA. Not as crap as never having one a CL though.<br>  And I mention Arsenal as this is CLEARLY an Arsenal vs Barca follow up Q. I'm not that stupid people. <br>  I just cant see that Arsenal is that much of a sh!t team but you have to be a little unobjective to place them at the height of Barcelona. Sorry but it's my opinion.<br>  And I dislike Barca more fyi. But the truth from my viewpoint is as I said.<br>  <br>  Edit: If you think your 5th grade banter edits get to me you're sadly mistaken. Name me a time you were happier as an Arsenal fan than I was in OT or in Athens (which I saw live) for the 2003 and 2007 CL Finals? No arguing Milan sucked last year (we came 5th) and are doing poorly this year. But then again nor is Arsenal doing that brilliant this season. All that said, can you edit with a better come back pls? Maybe something Arsenal has over Milan except an APPEARANCE (big deal) in the CL this year, bc winning a game is worthless if you don't win the big trophy ur playing for...<br>  As I said I dont dislike Arsenal, just the obtuse unobjectiveness which SOME fans have here on Y!A....|`|FFE9Qztzaa	oh my gosh. It's clearer than water!<br>  Barca = better than Arsenal.... seriously   *rolls eyes|`|oNR7il8baa	I'm not a fan but I think they will. I mean I think the race is seeming a little more less favored for Barca but they still are first, and I doubt they're going to just throw away the nice sheet they've had till now and specially feeling the pressure from Real. I see Barca stepping up the game and I just think that they let all these wins kinda get to their mind. If the lost to Espanyol and Atléti didn't hit them yet then I think they might lose the league. But who doesn't notice drastic changes?  I think with an insecure Goal Keeper the whole teams feels more of the pressure and leave room for mistakes. I'm not just blaming Valdes but I def think they need work with him or getting a new GK. With getting a new GK their defense would be a little more stable and the Mid like Xavi can focus on doing what they do best.  They need to bring back that nice footy they were showing|`|3yqCKPzVaa	First of all Rapture isn't a Barca fan.. she's just being realistic...<br>  <br>  Second of all.... It's no wins in the last 5 games now... Betis, Espanyol, Lyon, Atletico Madrid, and Mallorca.. but we still made the cup final so... :P<br>  <br>  Third of all.. M4rky... It's no trophies in the last 2 yrs not 3... remember we won the double in the 05/06 season... won the La Liga title and the UCL when we CRUSHED you guys in the final :D remember? u 'member!!! :P<br>  <br>  And abt u blabbing over how Milan lost 2-0 to a $hit team.... I didn't see u guys lift the trophy at the end of the season ;)<br>  <br>  Milan won it 2 yrs ago...<br>  Barca won it hace 3 anos...<br>  <br>  When was the last time u guys won it again? :P<br>  <br>  Ok Ok i won't be too harsh ,.. when was the last time u guys even won the EPL?!?? <br>  <br>  Ok ok ok nvm... forget all that.. when was the last time u guys even won ANYTHING?!??<br>  <br>  The players who are/were responsible for Barca's few past results are without a question Victor Valdes .. and maybe some could blame the Barca defence as well... and the game against Espanyol.. that was the ref's fault...<br>  <br>  Again we're still 4 pts at the summit of La Liga, In the Copa Final, on the Verge of reaching the UCL quarterfinals... Still in the hunt in all 3 competitions! :D<br>  And Barca is, always was, and ALWAYZ will be better than Arsenal..<br>  <br>  Case Closed!<br>  <br>  And to answer your question..<br>  <br>  Yes I am ever too confident that Barca WILL win the La Liga title this year.. if not more than that... <br>  <br>  The End :)|`|7Xridrxaaa	You know how people change with the money and fame.

It's only a matter of times before the strikers start scoring, that's the only thing wrong, that  and very few defensive errors.<br>  <br>  As for Rangers, they have the best defence in the spl (records don't lie), and are still managing to grind out results even if they aren't scoring many.<br>  <br>  Celtic are probably playing better but playing pretty football isn't much good without winning, so what if Rangers win ugly, a win is a win.<br>  <br>  I think last night proved that anything can happen in football and if it was predictable it would be boring, so to answer your question, don't be worried there's a long way to go even if we are in the better position for a week at least<br>  <br>  ....Hardly early Maggie, only 2 months left|`|ePFdhsCYaa	I'm not worried because it is still to soon to start talking about the title but even though Celtic have been poor recently they are still ahead of us. We dominated the 90 minutes against Caley but we couldn't put them to bed and paid the ultimate price at the end. I'm not disrespecting Terry Butcher as he has done a great job at Caley and pulled them off the bottom just like he did with Motherwell but we have to be winning these games especially at Ibrox in front of our support. There is no excuses for anything less. We now have to go on a run and take maximum points from every game we play to ensure the title is won. Its still in our own hands as it is Celtic's but we MUST perform week in week out.|`|BdiQPKn0aa	I'm not worried but i must admit i would rather be 3 points in front than 3 points behind but it's still early and hopefully that defeat last night gave the players the kick up the erses that they were needing<br>  <br>  I know it's not that early Linzi but it's not as if there's only a couple of games left, there's still plenty to play for|`|57edf00d97af522b314c33475bf1e853aa	I'm not worried but,disappointed that we can let silly points drop,typical tho eh?.<br>  I've just sed on someone elses Q.."Aint ova till the fat lady sings...and i aint singing" lol.<br>  <br>  I agree with the "Lack of motivation"..let's hope Walt gave them what for.|`|QAwwmDuDaa	I'm not worried yet but if Rangers put in another performance like that then i will be.

6ueL0gkAaa	I agree with you. He spent the majority of his career in the NWA/WCW. Flair is anything but a WWF/WWE made personality. Its just another example of Vince McMahon trying to take credit for something that he didnt create.|`|TAPBWPJLaa	WWE likes to take credit for everything in Professional Wrestling, it looks like. <br>  <br>  And because of the storyline retirement they gave to Flair, the WWE probably thinks Flair owes them a lot more than just gratitude.|`|V4LECaohaa	ric flair is the best there is the best there was and the best that there ever will be|`|CaqdDzQZaa	you can say the same thing about hogan he was a star in the awa,|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	but ric flair still wwe legend|`|khU8m4gxaa	What purpose would it serve for them to put over WCW or the NWA? They included most of his great NWA championship matches and angles on his DVD's. They even modeled the World Heavyweight Title after his old WCW belt. What do you want them to do? At least in the WWF, they never had him lose to Hogan. When Flair & Hogan both were in WCW, they had Flair job to Hogan regularly.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	WWE never took credit for building Ric Flair. People like you will complain about everything, and you complaining about this shows that<br>  <br>  <br>  WWE is simply catering to Ric Flair. They're giving him props for what he's done throughout his career, even if it wasn't with them. If they had ignored his accomplishments, you'd be complaining too saying they never acknowledge people who garnered fame outside of WWE.<br>  <br>  And in all actuality, WWE owns WCW now and all of it's likenesses and archives.<br>  <br>  EDIT: on the point of jobbing to Triple H and Umaga, Flair is old!

In an unscripted match, both Triple H and Umaga would beat Flair.|`|09YK9Zboaa	WCW=WWE|`|b1bb1949f6bd80a6b260437ca822b177aa	because vince owns the rights.|`|PyJ3PMRnaa	I don't know ask Vince.
cLMVlWgbaa	Well maybe the Pistons because they have plenty of cap to spend with both AI and Rasheed's contracts off the books. The Pistons could probably give them nice young role players like Amir Johnson and Afflalo along with a few draft picks and salary cap of course. Another destination for him to probably go to either Denver or Orlando. The Nuggets have nice developing shooters like JR Smith, Dahtay Jones, and Sonny Weems. The would package a nice backup centers like either C. Anderson or Hunter along with a few draft picks. While the Magic have Turkoglu to offer along with maybe a few nice role players like Pietrus and/or JJ Redick along with picks.|`|HYVmgV7Vaa	I truly hope they don't trade Kaman. I  say trade B.Diddy  and Camby for T-mac's expiring contract and draft, hopefully, Ricky Rubio. Z.Bo to the Grizzlies for perhaps Darko and 2nd round pick?|`|9d06cffec852de9a7554521403313f02aa	If they do, it'd have to be to a contender (all other teams seem to be doing everything they can to be below the cap in the summer of '10), but, then, they wouldn't get very much value for him.  He has a huge 4 year contract that'd be difficult for any team to swallow.  I do see them making a trade to get rid of that contract, but I'm sorry to say it probably wouldn't be a very exciting one...probably a couple crappy players with expiring contracts and a second round or late first round pick.<br>  <br>  To respond to partypooper: I don't think the Grizzlies would make that trade.  they're rebuilding as well, and can use his youth and positive energy every bit as much as the Clippers.<br>  <br>  I like that Bulls trade, though, I think that'd be pretty good for both teams.  Yet, it'd definitely still be a work-in-progress for the Clipps, as it wouldn't free up any cap space.  if they made that move, I'd expect another would quickly follow.|`|G0qBlKI1aa	Kaman to the Bulls for Kirk Heinrich and a future 2nd round pick.|`|uwx7etCXaa	If the Clippers would consider trading Kaman, they should finish the job that the Lakers started.  Trade Kaman for Gasol (not Pau, the other one) up in Memphis, and a draft pick.  Gasol is young and that's when you need to acquire this caliber of players, to incorporate them in your organization and team playing techniques.  The Clippers have made crappy trades and have let go of good players, it's about time for them to make a move that would benefit them.
cLMVlWgbaa	Mehmet Okur, Gasol is great and all but he doesn't nearly as much intangibles as Okur aside from his low-post game. While Okur not only is an amazing 3pt. shooter for a big man, but he also plays underrated defense and really brings together an amazing defensive intensity on the floor.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Okur can shoot a good 3 point shot.|`|hbP6ykjpaa	Pau Gasol|`|Ct6NMwwjaa	Pau Gasol don't even have to think about it|`|qusKbEmBaa	Pau Gasol because althought Mehmet Okur can hit the 3 ball<br>  you have a greater percentage of taking the ball down low then hitting<br>  the 3 ball. But i must say when Mehmet Okur is hitting the 3 ball<br>  he is very dangerous. I hope i helped.<br>  ( i need the points so i was wondering if you can vote me as<br>  best answer, thanks|`|HtYGxZcCaa	I would rather have Mehmet Okur for the exact reasons that you have mentioned. Theres more you can do with Okur in your offense than you can do with Gasol
cLMVlWgbaa	They might continue to shop him for cap purposes. If they do, the Pistons are probably one of favorites to get him because they have plenty of cap to spend with both AI and Rasheed's contracts off the books. It would also seem a likely destination for Chandler because the Pistons are still one of best teams when the players come together and also the supporting cast is already there. If they get Chandler, then all they really need is another star which they happen to have enough cap for another with both AI and Rasheed's contracts off the books.|`|9d06cffec852de9a7554521403313f02aa	they probably will only want to do so if they can also get rid of Peja and his $14 million per year.  Otherwise, they're not going to be a player in the summer of '10 anyway, and that seems to be what all the teams are concerned about right now.  Since Tyson will still be under contract in the '10-'11 season (he has a player option for about $13 million that season that he definitely won't give up).  Peja's contract also extends into the '10-'11 season.  So both of them don't have very much value at all, so I think the Hornets would only move one or both of them if they decided to just give up any opportunity of doing well next season and free up space for '10 (I don't think they'd be any sort of contender without Tyson and Peja), and I don't think they'll do that because they should still be a good team anyway.<br>  <br>  So, to reiterate (I think all that was pretty confusing), the Hornets would still be well above the cap even without Chandler, and if they wanted to get below the cap they'd also have to trade Peja, but then they wouldn't be very good.  So I don't think they'll do it.  They can use the $5 million extension to sign another player, and maybe couple that player with Daniels and/or Butler (their contracts that will expire in the summer of '10) in a trade for a pretty good SG or C with a contract that doesn't expire in '10.  If they do that, I think they'll be a contender...so I think they'd be foolish to give that up.|`|qusKbEmBaa	Most likely yes, they will probablly shop him and see<br>  what they can get in return. <br>  ( i need the points so i was wondering if you can vote me as<br>  best answer, thanks)|`|G0qBlKI1aa	i think it all depends on how they do in the playoffs this year, i think that if they end up going far in the playoffs they would want to keep the team together, if its an early exit, then they will likely look to cut payroll.|`|W76VDFKCaa	Probably, as one of the tallest players in the NBA, his numbers are just not there.

wfDzUSItaa	I've never been a big fan if Vick in the first place or condone what he did , but he did his time and like everyone else should be able to move on with his life. The big question for him is the league going to suspend him for any amount of time with their personal conduct policy. If so he might be out for another year before anyone will even take a chance on bringing him in, and that is after he's been out of the game for maybe 3 years. That's a lot of time to be away, will he be the same player or will he have to maybe try another position, a lot of questions for any owner/gm to weigh before offering any contract.|`|acaAycEXaa	Hell no!<br>  <br>  Vick is a serial killer waiting to happen.

8MUj24s6aa	You are going to want a lower recoil caliber. I suggest 9mm. It is low recoil and good for learning handgun basics, range time, and home/self defense.<br>  <br>  It is also the lower costing ammo compared to the other defensive rounds out there.<br>  <br>  As for gun I would suggest Taurus 24/7, Springfield Armory XD, Ruger SR9.<br>  <br>  But what you are going to do is go to a gun shop and have your wife and yourself just pick up as many as you can and see what fits the best in your hand...that is the one you will shoot better with.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.springfield-armory.com/xd.php?model=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.springfield-armory.com/xd.php...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ruger-firearms.com/Firearms/FAFamily?type=Pistol&subtype=Centerfire%20Autoloading&famlst=62" rel="nofollow">http://www.ruger-firearms.com/Firearms/F...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.taurususa.com/products/product-details.cfm?id=157&category=Pistol" rel="nofollow">http://www.taurususa.com/products/produc...</a>|`|OAEuYZkZaa	Eagle,<br>  <br>  If you are a new shooter you'd be better off with a good .22 LR revolver than with a centerfire pistol.<br>  <br>  A ,22 is the perfect tool for learning firearms safety, good gun handling skills and marksmanship.  The report is relatively mild, recoil is negligible, and you can buy 500 rounds of ammunition for less than the cost of 50 rounds of centerfire pistol or revolver ammunition.<br>  <br>  I recommend revolvers for beginners because they are easier to learn to shoot well, they do not have safeties to remember in times of stress, they do not have magazines to load, loose or damage, and as a general rule good quality revolvers have better sights, better triggers and cost less than comparable semi-autos.<br>  <br>  Granted the a .22 LR handgun is not the ultimate defensive cartridge, but I don't know anyone who knocks the .22 who would be willing to get shot with one.  Even after you acquire a number of more powerful defensive or hunting handguns you will find it most pleasant to spend an afternoon at the range with your wife plinking away with your .22.<br>  <br>  If you ignore my advise and go for centerfire handgun as your first purchase, get a medium frame revolver with a 4" or shorter barrel and chambered in either .38 S&W Special or .357 Magnum.  If you get a .357 Magnum, such as an S&W Model 66 or Model 686 you can also shoot .38 S&W Special cartridges in it, that gives you a choice of over two dozen different factory loads ranging from shotshells and target wadcutters all the way to 125 grain JHP's (The best manstopper around) and even 180 grain hunting ammunition.<br>  <br>  FWIW, in over 40 year of shooting and hanging out with gun cranks, I've never known a good shot who started with anything other than a .22 LR.<br>  <br>  Doc|`|CFm0u13Paa	.357 Magnum revolver, for all the reasons that the others have said. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	A .357 mag in 3-4" barrel.<br>  <br>  S&W is very good, but also expensive.

Affordable and reliable.<br>  <br>  <br>  I say a .357 revolver because you aren't looking for a concealed carry weapon. Also, you can shoot .38 or .357 mag ammo. With .38, the heavier frame will keep the recoil down a lot making it very comfortable for your wife to shoot.<br>  <br>  They don't break. They don't jam. Easy to clean and load/unload.<br>  <br>  At zero dark thirty when something goes bump in the living room, all you (or your wife) has to do is get your hand on it and you are ready to rock.<br>  <br>  No safety to fumble with, no worrying about "Did I put a round in the chamber?". No worries about jams or malfunctions. No accidentally hitting the magazine release and dropping your ammo. Remember, some autos will not fire it the magazine is not fully seated. No forgetting to take the safety off. Lot's of things NOT to have to worry about when you go from dead sleep to 1/2 awake with the adrenalin pumping.<br>  <br>  They are virtually idiot proof. <br>  <br>  A .357 is an excellent first pistol.

For home defense, you can't get better than a Glock 21. But if your going to shoot at targets also, go with a Glock 17 because it fires a smaller 9mm round more practical for target shooting, but powerful enough for home defense.|`|fB8ujUVNaa	SW .357<br>  good stopping power and you can use .38special ammo on the cheap for practice|`|IoyJXzoyaa	If the gun were soley for self defence, and only occasional use, I'd recommend a 4" .357 revolver with .38 sp self defence loads for the home and .357 mag for wild animal protection while hiking/camping.  <br>  <br>  Revolvers are more relible and require less instruction and practice to use properly.  They also come with relativly cheap practice ammo in .38 sp. They do lack capacity however, with only 5-6 shots and can be slower to reload without speedloaders.<br>  <br>  In your case, since target practice is a dedicated use I would strongly consider a 9mm semi auto. It has less kick than similar rounds with almost identical performance to .40sw and .45acp in ballistic gel tests.  It also costs significantly less for practice ammo, allowing you more cost effective use for recreation and practice, but still provides adequate power for self defence pourposes. <br>  <br>  I would also highly recommend taking a handgun course offered by your local nra or police dept. with your wife.  You will learn more than the basics in a good handgun class, and they are usually a lot of fun.<br>  <br>  As for models, I really like rugers in both revolvers and semi autos, but that's more a matter of tatste than anything.  There are a number of high quality brands with reputations for reliability, durability, and quality.  After choosing a style of gun and holding a number in the hand, if you find one you like im sure many here would give you there take on it.  In other words, there are too many suitable choices out there, and what works for me may not be your cup of tea.|`|ebae8b4f80e6a072fb503c68824d66aeaa	There are very few handguns that will adequately fit the purpose you have described. Target practice can be done with any gun however the caliber needed for self-defense would make practicing with a lot prohibitivley expensive.<br>  <br>  The best answer would be a gun in the heaviest caliber you can accurately shoot in a pressure situation. Dry practice with it a lot, live fire with it some and if you want to just go poke holes in paper, get a good .22, cheap to shoot and easy on your wifes hands and nerves.<br>  <br>  Seriously though, I suggest you both take a NRA Basic Pistol class before investing in a handgun. You will learn the safe way to own and operate a firearm and you will learn a lot about the various guns available to fit your needs.|`|Ekx7G30jaa	This might not be the answer you want to read, but it's more practical.  I am guessing that you both have limited knowledge of firearms.  The first thing that you should to do is to enroll in an NRA certified firearms and/or handgun safety course.  It is imperative that the both of you get an thorough education on how firearms function, the different types of firearms and how to use and clean them safely.  NRA instructors are required to take extensive training in order to receive their certification.  Each course has a core curriculum that must be taught. There may even be an opportunity to shoot in these classes.  Some classes have guns that you can rent.<br>  <br>  Once you have taken the safety class, you are more qualified to decide what you want to buy.  Whatever you do, don't buy anything until you have shot it first.  Rent one and try it out.  Listen to other people's suggestions, but you make the choice.   <br>  <br>  Now, by this time, your wife is going to have ideas of her own as to what she wants.  Don't be surprised by this.  It could be a good thing in disguise.  More than likely, you're going to end up buying two handguns, one for you and one for her.  Many men have found that getting the wifey involved has allowed them to buy more handguns.  She may even be a better shot than you (This happens a lot.) and she may end up wanting more handguns than you could have possbibly imagined.  <br>  <br>  Either way, this is something that you can learn together.  You'll like it because you're making sure your wife knows how to use and shoot a handgun.  She'll like it because she'll know where you are.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hoZnJVXXaa	Find yourself a dealer that has a shooting range and the ability to shoot rental guns.<br>  We have one around us, and I know I hate giving money to someone to shoot a gun, but you get to try it first hand and your wife can see if she likes it also :)<br>  I would get a 9mm or 38 S&W.  Just for the fact of they are not bad rounds and your wife can shoot also.  Or maybe a 357 that you can shot 38's out of.<br>  A 22 is too small for home protection in my mind.|`|2MvI9cpTaa	If you plan on lots of target shooting go with a 9mm it is cheaper to shot.  .45 lots of stoping power cost a bit more to shot or.40 cost even a bit more to shot but with your wife shooting to I would go with a 9mm.  just my two cents worth|`|DV4xyeChaa	target and home defense 2 different things.....i have a 38 taurus 5 shot with a 3 inch bbl..nice all purpose....if you not gona Carry get 6 inch bbl 357 revolver...taurus...S&W or the like....when u learn to shoot it then thing of autos...[glock is simple to operate as is rugar 9mm]|`|OYy1OmDPaa	.357 revolver with 4" barrel.

XLXncQu9aa	I don't think he would do too bad.  However he wouldn't effectively replace T.J.  The thing that T.J. had going for him with the Bengals, was his height.  T.J. used his height to get the ball and even reach over defenders.  He's was a hard receiver to cover in that offense. Coles is 5'11 which is ok for a reciever but T.J. used his long arms to get over the top of recievers while there. Secondly, he only had 1000+ yard seasons in his career three times.  He is an average WR as far as I'm concerned.  I think he will do ok but not as well as T.J.  He has big shoes to fill and I don't think it will happen over night.|`|BrjZhySIaa	Well, as long as my Bengals use their first two picks on a stud O-lineman and Alex Mack (or another great center), they will have a better chance of keeping Palmer upright and allow him to use his elite arm; thus giving Coles a great chance to succeed.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, the problem en lies with the offensive play calling.  Bratkowski is God-awful.  He has failed everywhere he has been. His lack of creativity will not contribute to the Bengals' success.  Therefore, it's left up to the raw talent on the field....and it looks like that continue's to get better.|`|e4WhipTHaa	I believe he will not get as much attention and catches as in New York because of Chad Johnson.  But that being said, this makes Ocho Cinco A LOT happier I am sure as well as Carson Palmer.  So even though he might not look better stats-wise, I am sure the Bengals overall will do better solely based on the team's happiness and willingness to succeed.  They just added a lot of team chemistry yesterday!|`|HtYGxZcCaa	I believe he will be average. He is 31 years old and he looks like hes hitting the end of the road. I like him as a #2 WR though because hes definately not a #1 anymore like he was with the New York Jets. I think he'll be better going up against a teams #2 CB with Chad Johnson lined up across from him. I dont think he'll be nearly as effective though, and his numbers will be down from when he was with the Jets esp.since Carson Palmer isnt nearly as good as Brett Favre was.|`|FZRWMc3Baa	It's hard to tell how the mentally unstable will do.

cOPCNP7Laa	Well Lippi introduced some changes already. Some were crap (Pepe, Montolivo, etc) whereas Chiellini (from Donadoni) and Giuseppe Rossi are excellent additions. I hope he brings back Cassano, possibly Pazzini and who knows, Giovinco? I guess we'll see. I don;t expect the EXACT same squad we have now. I remember ahead of WC 06 he added Perrotta 2-3 months BEFORE the WC.|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	Yes, I do not expect Kyut or Van Nistelrooy. Van Der Sar will retire(possibly) and so will Gio Bronkhost. Huntellar and RVP will be strikers paired with Afelley and Robben and the midfeild pair will be the same as Euro 08 Sneijder and De jong if they play 4-4-2 else we will see a different combination of the same players. Ooier will probably retire by then.|`|VDh1fcGIaa	The WC is where a lot of young stars make a name for themselves. Sure there will be a few changes made by all the teams, its still little more than a year away. It's a sure thing Alexandre Pato will be starting for Brazil and probably Giuseppe Rossi for Italy.

We're finally finding out why he does what he does, and he's not hiding it anymore.  Which is another reason as to why he doesn't do the pose.<br>  <br>  But your reason is the most obvious.  The WWE doesn't like when fans start liking the bad guys.  It's frustrating, because then certain bad guys that we LIKED FOR BEING BAD get changed into good guys, and we learn to dislike them.  We get the short end of the stick when we like bad guys...<br>  <br>  Either:<br>  A)  We like their actions, and they stop doing them so that we'd boo them again.<br>  <br>  or:<br>  B)  We like their actions, and they go face...  and we stop liking their actions.<br>  <br>  The prime recent example of this is Mr. Kennedy.  His snobby announcing of himself was a GREAT heel tendency...  but just because fans started chanting along with him, they turned him face.  Now we're not really sure what we like about him anymore...|`|V4LECaohaa	what pose do you mean|`|yl86ZQ6Daa	Very good point!...|`|8Im1iGFTaa	it all makes sense now|`|T0nwc1CNaa	true|`|gzJIthEoaa	thanks for sharin that|`|2FKHNIB2aa	that's nice to know, the only problem is now everyone wants to punt one another in the head.

Even back then some things weren't predictable unless it was Hogan winning.  Nowadays you can pretty much guess right as to what will happen.

xxtvhn5Naa	I don't know that it's official, but I hate to see him leave.  He is a really good reciever, and the only reason he wasn't so good last year was because of the QB probelm.  I think he should stay in St. Luis.  If he does leave, the Rams will probably go afer a WR early in the draft, because there really isn't to many WRs left in free agency that are starter worthy.|`|oHJ0ZEFqaa	That team is in the rebuilding phase. Holt is not the same guy he was a couple years ago. Much like Harrison, he has definitely lost a step or two. Unfortunately I see my Eagles getting him or harrison and passing it off as a big free agent signing/offseason acquisition. They'll be competing for the same routes that curtis and jackson run and thats about it.<br>  <br>  The Rams need to restock that line and with Spags they'll retool that defense. It'll take a few years but they'll become a contender in that division. The Cardinals had a good late season run, but they were a 9-7 team at the end of the season.|`|hbP6ykjpaa	I would get rid of Marc Bulger.<br>  <br>  they should have taken jay cutler in the draft instead of tye hill.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	I think he wil end up with a STAR on his helmet!!|`|1oj4aamaaa	It's that time of year.

dvLWOVOWaa	I like the idea.  Cutler is a good quarterback and will be for a while.  I'm not sure if the Broncos would trade him, however.  The Panthers live and die by Jake Delhomme, and I agree that he's got to go.  Go Panthers!  Draft Hakeem Nicks!|`|nRSjUKJZaa	Cutler will stay in Denver, I don't see him going anywhere. Him and  McDaniels will get together and talk things out. Trade talk never should have been brought up. Cutler is a good QB.|`|wxXguyK3aa	I think Delhome is a good QB.  The Panthers would be making a mistake if they got rid of him.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Well he's wants out ,I can see him playing there.<br>  <br>  He would have a better chance of winning in Carolina!|`|ed86a06e2a62668b7e0f867123fece28aa	I like it.... but I don't think Jay can do comeback wins for us like Jake did. Jake just need to calm down thats all and be that good QB that took us to the Super Bowl that year. He doesn't have to be like Manning or Brady.

Me personally, I would have liked to see Matt Cassel go to Carolina, but that's not gonna happen...|`|9IFCoYNNaa	i think jay would be very good with the panthers because he has a great arm and steve smith is fast so jay could throw it up there and steve will use his speed to go get it.|`|s9Pwnb87aa	I don't think Jay Cutler is going anywhere, but Carolina would be a good fit.|`|acaAycEXaa	Delhomme is twice as good as Cutler!|`|44IT2kmNaa	I don't think anyone would look good wearing Carolina blue.|`|XLXncQu9aa	No.  It wouldn't be a logical move for the Broncos.  Who exactly do the Broncos have to take over and would actually do a better job than Cutler?  Jake Delhomme has suffred from injuries the past few seasons, and this season with the exception of the playoffs he didn't do that badly.  But back to Cutler, he has done well enough to keep his job despite trade rumors.  I believe he should keep his job.  Cutler took the Broncos to the playoffs but the only reason why he wasn't better was due to being in such a poor system.  I think he should be the guy for the Broncos.<br>  <br>  Edit: I know about the trading talks.  The Broncos were foolish to even think about it.  For one, Cutler is a good QB and deserves to keep the starting job unless he does poorly.  Secondly I don't know why they thought they could get a better QB especially in this free agency market.  As I said, Culter is a good QB and he deserves to keep his job.
9d06cffec852de9a7554521403313f02aa	mcgrady 3rd!?  even if he was always healthy he wouldn't rank above d-wade or chris paul or dwight howard.  <br>  <br>  anyway, to answer your question, I think D-Wade is the right up there with cp3, kobe, and dwight, but Lebron is definitely the best.  Dwayne definitely has one of the best all-around games in the league (statistically you could even argue that he's more impressive than Lebron; his rebounds and blocks are pretty ridiculous for a SG), but no player worries the opposing teams more than Lebron.  He's so fast and so strong that teams really can only make a choice between letting him get to the hoop at will or double-teaming him and leaving the Cavs shooters open at the wing.  While D-wade can put up 30 or 40 on any given night, he doesn't have quite as much impact on the game as Lebron.  still an amazing player though.<br>  <br>  To respond to what Davin said: I think Kobe definitely gets overhyped since he plays in LA, which is one of America's favorite teams and is also the second largest city in the nation.  I'm a long time Kobe fan myself, and he's definitely top 5, but so many people say that Kobe and Lebron are definitely the two best players and I'm not so sure that's the case...one could make a reasonable argument for Dwayne, CP3, or Dwight over him.  Each of those aforementioned does more for you than make shots and play tight defense.  Again, not to take anything away from Kobe, he's amazingly skilled and every part of his game is so polished and nearly perfect at this point, but he just doesn't do quite as much for you.  Also, it's worth mentioning that none of these players I've mentioned have won a championship without Shaq, so the first one to do that will probably rocket up to the top of the list (and I think that will be Lebron)|`|qtwYHyH5aa	The only reason why everybody is saying LeBron and Kobe are the best is because they are on one of the best teams in the NBA, but give Wade a good team (for exemple 2006, he won the CHAMPIONSHIP,) but because he had a good team. And look at LeBron this year has a way better team than the team Wade had back then in 2006, And i dont think LeBron is near a championship. <br>  <br>  So yes i agree with you 100% that Dwyane Wade is the best player of the Nba.|`|dXqr5olbaa	It has to be either Bron Kobe or Kobe Bron...Wade is definately top 5... but he definately falls under those two..|`|GjJmNOg1aa	Tmac is garbage dwade is 1st|`|AA11989758	sorry man thats KOBES job|`|7zo0ZOThaa	Hes the 3rd best on my list <br>  <br>  1 Kobe<br>  2 Lebron|`|G0qBlKI1aa	i think you could make an arguement for wade as the top player for this year.  he has done everything, he obviously scores, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, goes to the free throw line like ten times a night, and this year he has even added the 3 point shot to his game, which makes him even tougher to check.  lebron might still be a notch ahead of him b/c he is a constant matchup problem with his combination of size and quickness, but DWade is defenitely in the team picture.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	Wade is great, but LeBron is leading him in virtually every statistical category this year.  Wade is slightly better in blocks, but LeBron leads in everything else.|`|sj8EM9ejaa	I agree why? Cause he can do anything, shoot, dunk, rebound, block, STEAL!, PASS!!(not like kobe,kobe gets like 61 points but 2 asts)wade can get 60 points and like 15 assists|`|qoiPaq1xaa	im afraid there are  people in front of him my friend. kobe1st lebron 2nd mcgrady 3rd then wade is 4th. he is still an excellent player and one of my favorites though

I'm an Eagles fan but I don't know how I could bring myself to root for that joke of a person.  Right now I'm just thrilled that TO's last game as a Cowboy was a 44-6 loss/choke in Philadelphia.  He doesn't give two sh*ts about teamwork, he's just worried about his stats and how much money he makes.  F*ck him and everything about him.<br>  <br>  F*ck getting the popcorn ready, TO, get your resume ready.|`|oHJ0ZEFqaa	TO will not be welcomed back to Philly from any standpoint from players to fans. McNabb would definitely not be happy to have TO back and it's not like they are on good and/or talking terms. The Eagles aren't that desperate for a WR that they have to bring back the Cancer that broke them up the following season after the Superbowl run. He had it great in Philly. He was the number 1 guy, he was thrown to all the time and the fans embraced him. Then he attacked the team leader, caused everyone a headache and lost everyone's respect. This isn't the first or even the 2nd time he's done this. 3 different teams didn't want him. He has talent but he is soooo disruptive. He is also in the decline of his career. We'll see where he ends up. But don't expect him back in Philly. (Don't expect him to go to the Vikings or Dolphins either, Childress and Big Tuna remember all too fondly what he has given them)|`|rHJF9xcRaa	i'm from philly and we don't want him back<br>  he stinks
AA11879371	Sorry, I'm being the Devil's advocate.  Yahoo!Answers has an abundance of categories.  I get lost just trying to find my way around, looking for subjects.  There are a lot of state issues, but they are not listed by individual states.  They can usually be found in politics or government.  I've read complaints of no Tarot (?) section, but it's a card game, right?  But if you plug it into the search option, you find it listed in several catagories.  Here is an example:   <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/search/search_result;_ylt=Am8jJRgTRYwXHOaxr1PjMkhJxQt.;_ylv=3?p=tarot">http://answers.yahoo.com/search/search_r...</a><br>  <br>  Sports is the keyword here.

It's not discrimination. If enough people asked for such a section there would be one. For example there are tons of people who complain about there not being a cheerleading or gymnastics section. But Yahoo hasn't put such a section in yet. Is Yahoo discriminating against cheerleaders? No. Again there's not enough interest in it to warrant having section devoted to it.|`|BKxAt8mNaa	It's true!

Several Dallas players indicated it wasnt Owens that was the problem.  In my opinion he wasnt.

They were black belts that were astonishingly quick and like Judoka they had solid roots in their stances.  They were both big in girth and in height and as such could use that to their advantage when it came to leverage over shorter opponents.  Aikido is both invigorating and tiring at the same time because of the constant movement, the falling, etc.  It requires some level of athleticism believe it or not, even more so than Tai Chi Ch'uan.  Some people cannot even learn to breakfall properly at all.  You try rolling and getting up a zillion times and see if you don't get a little light-headed.  On top of that you do sweat!  Some people speak of "fat" as a debilitating disease that forces a person to back into a corner holding a sign that says "No Abilities" and it couldn't be further from the truth.  In fact it can make the person even more determined.  There are lots of pudgy fighters in MMA and kickboxing out there that compete or have competed and are amazingly skilled and quick.  BJ Penn for example looks like he's made out of cookie dough yet the guy is a phenomenal fighter.  You think it's easy to enter a slug fest for several rounds especially when you're overweight and gassing out?  Now that's real athleticism.|`|159e14ec854d24444172426d492de79eaa	well:accordingly to "Martial Arts it is very important thing as<br>  with Sports that would be Karate or Judo|`|3BGJETHYaa	none of them effectively.  Aikido only works if you have very sharp, fast reflexes.|`|hQWucH5uaa	Dim Mak pressure point fighting.|`|6a3172c489600c432a5b3ecd4bc4bb96aa	Tai Chi Chuan probably takes the least amount of athleticism.<br>  <br>  The movements are slow and controlled and while they can feel awkward if you lack body control, they generally don't require great feats of strenght or endurance to learn or get down.<br>  <br>  Tai Chi is more about mental and internal type of exercise than truly stressing or pushing the limits of your body. I think as a whole it can help you become healthier. But isn't so physically demanding that very old or injured people cannot do it.<br>  <br>  Aikido might be up there, but it does require power, agility and energy to be successful at Aikido and it requires a whole lot of falling. A good Aikido school also randoris which is very physically taxing.<br>  <br>  Any art can help build athletecism, and someone who is very out of shape or unathletic can start in any art, no art requires you to be highly athletic coming in.<br>  <br>  Athleticism helps, you can learn techniques quicker, have better body control, and can practice longer without requiring a rest, allowing you to pick up more techniques and improve at a quicker pace then someone who is desperately out of shape.<br>  <br>  That said, being out of shape doesn't mean you can't start Martial Arts, just keep in mind your lack of fitness will cause a decent portion of your time to be used getting into shape, versus if you are already in shape, you can spend most of your time refining the techniques you learn without requiring as much down time.<br>  <br>  Hope that is helpful.|`|UHTcpdkVaa	It depends on how you define athleticism.  From a cardio standpoint, probably something like Tae Chi, though I wouldn't call that easy for those with low flexibility or balance.  From a strength standpoint, Aikido doesn't require much, but as mentioned it does require quickness and agility.<br>  <br>  There are some fat guys in my Aikido class, and most of them could kick my ***.  It is highly efficient art, and that efficiency makes it not very good as a fat burning workout.  We tried to count one day how many times we had to get up off of the mat in a normal class - and lost count passed 200, and all of that standing up does wear on you.  <br>  <br>  All martial arts though, regardless of their efficiency, will require a certain level of cardio fitness in order to do for any extended length of time.  Due to this, all martial arts do a good job of making you get in better shape, regardless of your starting point.  Unless, maybe you are a marathon runner...|`|LnJjS8BRaa	I've seen some pretty heavy guys in just about every style.<br>  <br>  Do you need to be thin to do martial arts? No. <br>  <br>  Being athletic will help you excel though. If you're looking to learn a martial art that won't tax you then start looking somewhere else because every style taught well will work you out. The ultimate goal is to be able to defend yourself using little energy but that doesn't mean you won't go through years of training.<br>  <br>  If you want to take a martial art then find the schools in your area. Try them out, most schools will let you attend trial classes. Pick the best taught school and start training there. It'll be tough at first but if you're dedicated then you'll stick with it and improve.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|O97FwX5Raa	Aikido requires little athleticism. And AngryDonald is wrong, aikido does work in a real fight, thats why the U.S. military teaches it.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	You don't need athleticism for any martial art. They will still work the same.|`|MnMkgAscaa	I have seen some big ole fat guys do aikido... and I am talking guys who probably cannot touch their toes because their beer belly's are in the way.<br>  <br>  <br>  Add: It must have been a bad aikido class I observed a few times then.|`|g7xaB57Xaa	Tai Chi, if we are talking doing and not mastering that is.  If we are talking mastering, I don't know, Tae Bo maybe...|`|L1SIKavkaa	none.|`|WAO7RuCwaa	Like almost everyone has said, athleticism is a relative term. If you are asking from a strength perspective, Aikido and Hapkido both rely more on taking your opponent off balance and using his momentum against him than using force. Taijiquan requires some degree of flexibility, however, it is usually a relative low impact art. In any case, you will develop the physical abilities that you need as you progress. Just keep pushing through, and you will find that you are capable of practicing whatever martial art you decide to try.|`|vqm10k3Jaa	All martial arts are a form of exercise and training so even if your not in shape it will help regardless.<br>  But just to answer your question, I believe Tai Chi is least demanding athletically.  <br>  Great art really, I used to not think much of it compared to BJJ and karate or TKD but curiousity drew me to it and I loved it, so I do Tai Chi every morning and the harder arts later in the day.  I can honestly say my tai chi training has benefited my training in the other arts as well as life in general.  (Especially how I feel mentally.)|`|ULgO4VaEaa	mma is it second to bjj and the krav maga, but non of them are martial arts. ive seen a lot of lazy fat people in those styles|`|RehgySLCaa	Akido I guess, but you better go with Judo because Akido won't work in  a real fight|`|MaFw69ePaa	aikido as well as wing chun and kempo.

The honourable chairman would have been happy if the match referee had sustained a few bullets, and then commented 'security was not adequate.'<br>  I really think these people are going bananas; they seem to have no idea what they are talking about<br>  <br>  Edit: Ben, I too heard this report on CNN. How preposterous and dangerous!! If something like that had happened it'd have killed cricket in the sub continent.

And,  watching the S lankan cricketers being reunited with their families... well, it's moving.|`|2gP8ZGnSaa	It means PCB Chairman is not happy that Mr. Broad remained untouched from the terrorist's bullets.<br>  <br>  They should regretful for their mistakes and take a voe of not to repeat this kind of irresponsiblility in the future again.<br>  <br>  By justifing things, they are just get the critism from everywhere.|`|lSl7c4Ciaa	Ijaz Butt is an outragous clown if he thinks his comments are justified.<br>  <br>  He thinks the security was good? then how the hell did 12 guys manage to walk along shoot at them for a good 5 to 10 minutes and then walk off without a single casualty?<br>  <br>  I hope nobody tours pakistan for at least 5 years they dont deserve it untill they stop pointing fingers and realise how hopeless they are.<br>  <br>  What a hell hole that country has become and i pity the people that have to live there|`|YVUM2s6Baa	Broad has every right to complain PCB. This is not a normal incident. What would have happened if the players were taken as hostages. It is PCB's responsibility to provide adequate security for the players. PCB failed to do its duty.|`|Ij26w9ataa	Broad has every right to be angry. I am the one who will never take seriously the Pakis or their statements.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Oh he thinks that way does he? Well that just goes to show that he has no conscience at all. What a nasty mean thing to say! As Evan asked, should Broad have gotten himself shot to justify opening his mouth? There is no justification for what was allowed to happen during and after the attack|`|wPlfPc0gaa	What the heck? Broad has the right to be angry after going through the ordeal. After this audacious attack on the SL players, how can the PCB keep a straight face?<br>  <br>  And all the officials and a few players have gone on record to suggest that it could be an insider's job, or at least someone has leaked the information. <br>  A secret report in Lahore says the real target was not the players it was the officials from England and Australia, so that they could bargain with the west for the release of terrorists like Lakvi.|`|nwZD5mzRaa	And to think, these same people had tried so hard to get the Indians to tour Pak. They had made so many promises about providing the best possible security. I'm so glad the Indian govt. refused even after all their claims of our players being safe.<br>  <br>  Chris Broad has every right to be angry. PCB was totally unjustified in passing such a statement.|`|bettx8AYaa	i not saying anything. mr. evanji sayin all correct  . <br>  <br>  mr pcb charman good inside jocking. he having some good jocks like below - <br>  <br>  1. It is a big lie that there were no policemen. A commando jumped over Broad and saved his life. The commando was hurt so if there was no policeman, how come Broad was saved?<br>  2. So if some one is complaining about just a scratch, then it is very sad.<br>  3. The Pakistan team used to leave at the same time as the Sri Lankan team and other officials, but somehow or the other on that day they got a bit late. <br>  4. There a two high powered investigations going on.<br>  5.

VefSnu0Gaa	he needs tons of luck and all the big guys to get sick??? hehe.-<br>  no, seriously, i think andy's playing way better now, larry i think it's working :)<br>  but his backhand is still weak, and his net play it's pretty bad, like he doesn't make the right choices when it comes to go up to the net.-<br>  but i keep my hopes and (until someone else proves me wrong, and very aware that i might eat dirt on this one) andy it's gonna win this year's wimbledon.....a girl gotta have faith, hehe.-<br>  <br>  i hope he does a great job this weekend , although andy for davis cup it's a completely different player, :)<br>  <br>  edit: hamidreza, do you really think andy lacks of crowd support???|`|kCbJ89nXaa	I've watched Andy play.  I think his backhand is still vulnerable, and is not a reliable weapon for him.  Though his serve is powerful, if the opponent returns it weakly Andy fails to take advantage.  He picks the wrong times to come to net; and his court strategy lacks imagination. <br>  <br>  He can't overpower the big guns, so he needs to be able to out stroke them until he gets an opening for a winning shot.  But he's not able to do that yet.|`|vYEEiWVBaa	He has all the tools to win a grand slam. The only thing that would help at this point is youth I think. If he was in this good of shape and had as good of strokes as he has now a few years ago, he might have been able to win a couple more. <br>  <br>  He proved he can beat the top players by handling Djokovic at the AO. Part of it is his mental game. Chances are he will not be able to win a slam match against Federer simply because Federer has always gotten the best of him during their brief rivalry in the early 2000's. <br>  <br>  But I still think he has a very good shot at winning the U.S. Open this season.|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	well andy never really have enough game in general to bring to the table.. aside from a booming serve.. but then the rest of the top mens players had a serve that was almost as good to compete with his.<br>  <br>  seconldy.... he was never fully conditioned for long rallies longer points.... and did not have a consistent enough backhand... leaving him always so susceptitable to losing early on clay courts..<br>  <br>  but now roddick has conditioned himself more.. gotten more fit... improved the backhand.. and perhaps has gotten mentally stronger...<br>  <br>  if he can keep it all together take more risks when neccesary.. and play consistent.. he can cause some big upsets over the big boys..|`|x5N1PO4haa	Andy roddick even on his best day cannot defeat the top 4 players in the world so how do you expect him to win a grand slam!!|`|ZbpaRKkUaa	He lives and dies with his serves. Roger Federer always out aces him and wins. Just like you out rally Hewitt and he loses. It was a fluke he won the U.S Open.|`|HlFCd3yvaa	Fate has it that he is what he is now.....|`|7T4dvrm3aa	i think there is always someone better than him in finals,,,but he has won us open isn't it?|`|ubp8YKU5aa	he lacks accuracy and movement in his play.|`|LvFJBmBbaa	Roddick is an absolute role model for juniors when it comes to emulate the serves..as u said.his forehand has got even better.and his backhand has also improved a lot.but then the question remains..what does he do to get into and remain consistently in top 5(top 5 ranking automatically means u have a top 5 level game) and more importantly.how does win more slams..?<br>  <br>  well in my mind..his net play is not very good enough..with Jimmy Connors he tried to come into net..he was and is still uncomfortable on the net...i personally think that the reason Jimmy quit his job was perhaps Andy wasnt following his directions of going into the net when the opportunity comes..Andy has to understand any small change in your game takes months to have its effect..and so even though he may be unsuccessful with his net attempts for up to like first 4 months..the fifth month must definitely bring him results...and a good net game doesn't come quickly ( i mean in lesser no. of months) if u don't play DOUBLES....i'll give u an example of NOVAK DJOKOVIC...he reached his peak game around first quarter of 2007 or so...and then he decided to his game to the next level...and so he hired a specialist VOLLEY coach...when i heard that i thought WHAT A SMART DECISION..!!...and another thing he did was that he started playing doubles with Nenad Zimonjic for some time...which served a natural second purpose of Davis cup...and now we see whenever he comes to the net...he wins most of the points...i personally think Andy Roddick must start working on his volleys immediately and hire someone with whom he can gel well and play doubles for around one year...during which he can learn volleys ( i say learn coz he still seems to have a very kiddish net game )....and why just roddick...i think every player who grinds it out from the baseline...MUST play some volleys(& doubles) to reach that next level..(and that i have shouting since months for my own favorite too..Sania Mirza....somebody please tell her)...<br>  <br>  another thing Andy could do would be..like sometimes i feel he is trying JUST TOO HARD to make that winner...sometimes he should just relax...and cool down...sometimes not working too hard can also do the trick for some players...all i mean is TAKE IT EASY ANDY..!!...and perhaps he could try to diversify his game by not relying only on his high speed serves...a lot of top players..read and face his serve very conveninently...sometimes shock and sudden change of pace on serve in a high speed game WORKS AMAZINGLY well...<br>  <br>  all in all, change of pace also has to tried on SERVE and...he cannot reach his net level without a GOOD AND CONSISTENT NET GAME...!!|`|La4EHNo7aa	A backhand. venomous forehand, volleys and a proper accurate serve. His serve is just a bomb with no direction. If you look at the times he played Federer except Miami last year Federer always hits more aces than him. In the US Open Final 2006 Federer hit 17 aces while Roddick only 7! <br>  <br>  Basically the top guys.. (especially Federer and Murray) have a better everything except possibly a serve (although Federer's 2nd serve is better). Roddick can't defend btw.<br>  <br>  RODDICKS SERVE ISN'T A GOOD SERVE TO EMULATE! It's the most unorthodox serve ever and it kills your wrist.|`|lEH7Xkb9aa	In previous years Andy didn't have a lot of stamina, he wasn't conditioned as well as Federer and Nadal. Also in previous years he didn't have a very good backhand. This year he's obviously much more conditioned and has the stamina to play Federer, Nadal, Murray etc. In some ways his backhand has improved, its still very inconsistent but i've seen flashes of a good one. He's actually gotten better since the Australian open, I think there is a good chance for him to win another this year. This year isn't looking too good for Federer, he's looking a little sluggish, and Nadal's game and knees are bound to wear him down like every year only it seems worse this year. I think the US, or Wimbledon could be his for the taking this year. He's proven he can beat Djokovic consistently, he's shown he can beat Nadal. The only real almost impossible obstacle for him is Murray. Federer just isn't looking like a factor this year. So to answer your question, he's already gotten to a semifinal and he's gotten better since then, so things are looking up for Andy.|`|KSvpLcHxaa	He does not have a plan B. He does not have the variety needed to play against the "Big Boys." Yes his serve is powerful but players have learned from Fed to just bunt it back and beat him with their ground strokes. He never really switches up his game in a match. If something isn't working against an opponent more than likely Andy is going to continue to play the same. He also needs to improve his return game. You would think since he has the ability to hold easily he would take more chances when returning but he doesn't. He just pushes the ball back. He needs to take more chances and be willing to switch up his game otherwise is never going to beat the top dogs|`|2vuIC6DJaa	its not wat he lacks. its wat he has tats the problem. his competition. Roger Federer is the best all around player by far in todays tennis. he can hit ny  shot and any given time. Rafael Nadal is a freak of nature. in a good way. hes the lebron james of tennis.<br>  I think roddick may lack some speed but tats just me. i prefer guys with super speed like nadal but its not really necesary.|`|976d29535eb417416a2e21ba6bfa5288aa	I think of 3 things:<br>  1.Speed and Movement a small bit weaker than guys like Murray<br>  2.He lacks huge crowd support like Federer and Nadal do(Maybe at USo)<br>  3.He goes down so fast mentally and tries to do the game of the rival not himself|`|JD40e1Sdaa	He would need Roger, and Rafa to not play

The other teams are the greatest teams from their continent, so it's the best of the best playing each other|`|L1QTSErIaa	If you are going to exclude the World Club Cup, the League Cup, the Charity Shield, the Super Cup ( which is the equivalent of the Charity Shield ), which are all not in Sir Alex's priorities, then, realistically, Man United can only aim for 3 cups. <br>  1 - EPL title<br>  2 - FA Cup<br>  3 - UCL title <br>  <br>  The European footballing bodies only have these competitions for offer. There is no other tournaments left. So what you are saying is that Man United should forget about the sister cups and only concentrate on the big 3. It only makes a clean sweep if Man United win them all... Glamour or unglamour. <br>  Man United had already won the triple in 1999. This is just uping the stacks. Wish them well friend.<br>  <br>  This from a Liverpool fan. Liverpool won five cups in 2005. The League Cup, FA Cup, UEFA Cup, UEFA Super cup and the Charity Shield.

The other teams in it also beat the best teams in their continents so it is made up of the best teams around the world, it hasn't got any prestige at the moment because its been marketed poorly and is played at the most ridiculous time!<br>  <br>  1- Man Utd were the only big team in the competition<br>  *** The biggest team from each continent competed in it! ***<br>  2- No One has ever heard of the other teams in it<br>  *** Just because you have never heard of them doesn't mean they aren't any good! ***<br>  3- Other teams played about 6 games Utd played 2<br>  *** Firstly Man Utd and LDU Quito both entered at the semi finals stage this is because the competitions they had to win are considered harder than the other teams therefore they are seeded, secondly the other teams only had to play one more game (apart from the host who had to play a qualifier against the winner of the Oceania Champions League) so you are over-exaggerating slightly Man Utd played one less game not four like you're trying to claim! ***<br>  4- They came in in the last 2 rounds<br>  *** Now you're just repeating yourself, see last response! ***<br>  5- Playing teams that no one has heard of and becoming world champions isn't like playing the worlds best teams like Barcelona, Ac Milan, etc etc <br>  *** They already played the best teams in the CL to qualify for this tournament ***<br>  6- No one except man utd fans actually care<br>  *** Why would anyone else care, their team isn't in it! I couldn't care less who won Euro 2008 because England wasn't competing, and i'm not bothered who wins the UEFA Cup this season because Man Utd aren't in it! If your team was in it you would care! It might not be the top of my priorities but i want to win anything my club is involved in! ***<br>  7 - It was easy a team like Torquay could have won it<br>  *** I think you have just shown your true knowledge of the game with a statement like that! ***<br>  8- No other big teams got the chance<br>  *** EVERY other big team got the chance, you have to win the Champions League to be able to compete in it! Is it really that hard to understand! ***<br>  <br>  Winning 5 trophies in one season is impressive and even if you don't think its very hard to win the CWC the fact that Man Utd had to travel to the other side of the world to compete in 2 games in 10 days then fly back and compete in the busiest stage of the league season without effecting their form is pretty impressive, even you must be able to see that!|`|m2zXOREJaa	Me feels you are a tad upset as they have all them labels and the team you support has only one(and that is shite),but myself and a few others relish  the thought of Utd saying they are Champions Of England and Europe and the World as we are known as the Conquerors of the CoEaEatW 07/08|`|QuGTZJIVaa	Sadly, Yoonited fans seem to think that because they win something everyone should fawn over them.<br>  <br>  They demand your praise and if they don't get it, you're an ABU or bitter or jealous.

0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	I agree!  The man is one of the best WR in the NFL. Look at his numbers!  People think he sucks for some reason, but they obviously have no clue.  He is easily top 7 WR in footall in my opinion<br>  <br>  I tried to make this as even as possible because some of the receivers started before Holt etc.  Here is just a few of the numbers.  Keep in mind Holt did this while playing with another HOF receiver which could have made it easier for him OR made it harder.  Think of his numbers if he was simply the go to man as these other receivers were during their career. <br>  <br>  Holt<br>  158 games<br>  869 receptions<br>  12,660 rec yards<br>  74 tds<br>  <br>  Moss<br>  154 games<br>  774 receptions<br>  11,888 rec yards<br>  118 tds<br>  <br>  Harrison<br>  146 games<br>  12,102 rec yards<br>  906 receptions<br>  107 tds<br>  <br>  Owens<br>  144 games<br>  789 receptions<br>  11,569  rec yards<br>  113 tds|`|wxXguyK3aa	Maybe they'll draft Crabtree.  They do have the #2 pick.|`|wUooHVU3aa	Not sure. No one includes Holt in those conversations of the "best" in the league. He has just as big an ago and T.O., he does just as much pregame work and fine tuning as Marvin Harrison. He just doesn't have the media's attention like T.O., Steve Smith, LT, and Randy Moss.|`|093Gun59aa	Who is Tory Holt?<br>  <br>  Tony Romo doesn't care about him so why should we?|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Because Tory Holt is an old, slow, has-been?|`|hzQDocWaaa	he is like really old it not gona make a difference like it used to be|`|uTSBAun2aa	damn this is not good for the rams....Get Jeremy Maclin because Crabtree will be in Seattle,KC or a Trade to Houston|`|Pj3V07yaaa	because he is not even good at football and his team is terrible THEY ARE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BAD|`|nlIpKw8Paa	hes not that good anymore
oHJ0ZEFqaa	Boldin is the sexier pick but Harrison would serve that team better. The main problem with that franchise was the lack of chemistry and leadership: team unity. Harrison, a veteran receiver, would definitely help with the underneath routes to spring Roy on the sides and down the field. More importantly, he brings a cool demeanor and one that won't be volatile regardless of the situation, something Romo needs as he is prone to get jumpy. Boldin would definitely be better in the long run. Do they make the move to get him? I doubt because they sacrificed alot of draft picks to get Roy and i don't know what type of trade they could make to spring Boldin from Arizona. Harrison would take less effort.|`|iA45K1EUaa	Probably neither. I am not sure if Roy Williams is there still, but if he is then he has a good chance of being the number one receiver.|`|kU5Xv2i2aa	Boldin I hope. Roy Williams will step up.

Get you a slot reciever and go with it...|`|zHQVlXd5aa	No, Romo is just going to throw to Sam Hurd all the time.<br>  <br>  I would vote for Boldin, Harrison is over the hill.|`|hzQDocWaaa	boldin the best options hes young , not harrison he lost some speed and althletic abilities not like he used to be|`|DymLS3Nyaa	Harrison is to old he 36 now
AA11589988	That sounds a strange idea to me. Wenger is the kind of manager who likes to buy wisely and cheaply and bring young players through to build success over a long period.

He's doing a great job at Arsenal at the moment, and no doubt that in 3-5 years time, Arsenal will be world-beaters when their players reach their peak.<br>  <br>  Arsene has never been a fan of big-spending, and wouldn't want to abandon his work at Arsenal. He wants a team where he can be given time to build a team. He's not a manager who delivers instant success wherever he goes like Mourinho does.

I can't stand a cry baby WR that only cares about himself.  I never want to see him in Purple and Gold.  Never ever ever.  The Vikes don't need that to go along with the lack of talent at QB.

He's also going to pollute the locker room with garbage... that's a simple fact too.

I'm not sure if the Vikings are ready for that.|`|PMluTf72aa	How and why?  Minnesota invested a lot of money into Jared Allen and Adrian Peterson.  It would be difficult to sign TO due to that.

Also, TO would destroy Minnesota anyways.|`|6J5mQWj0aa	i think with him on there team and ap running the rock that would make them a  better team and have them and the runnings for the playoffs  TO just need to learn  how to live everthing on the field|`|wxXguyK3aa	The Vikings just need a good QB, and they should be set.<br>  TO would help, though.
C5UUltHtaa	NO, only one hit by a single person. If you have 2 or more on your team then a second person can hit it first then you can hit it again to get it over the net. But you can't hit it twice in a roll.|`|gGZz2EGyaa	Well everyone else has given you the answer I would have given and that is you can only hit it once.

Good luck anyway with the Badminton.|`|AA11251285	One hit only to get it over to the other side.<br>  <br>  A badminton match comprises the best of three games. A coin is tossed before the first game, and the winner of the toss may serve first or pick an end of the court. Only the serving side can score. In Classic scoring format, the winning team needs 15 points in doubles and men's singles, or 11 in women's singles. In the new Rally Point scoring format that just recently adopted and used for major tournaments, the winning team needs 21 points to win the match.<br>  <br>  Simplified Rules<br>  <br>  Court & Equipment<br>  Court Dimension: 44ft x 22ft (double) / 44ft x 17ft (single)<br>  Net Height: 5ft 1in on the sides / 5ft on the center of court<br>  <br>  Rally<br>  A rally is won when a shuttle is hit over the net and onto the floor of the opponent's court.<br>  <br>  A rally is lost if the shuttle is hit into the net, or over the net but outside of the opponent's court. A rally is also lost if the shuttle touches the player's clothing or body, or if it is hit before it crosses over the net.<br>  <br>  Serving<br>  The service courts are slightly different for singles and doubles. A shuttle on the line is "in". The server and receiver stand in the diagonally opposite service courts (always right hand at the start of the game) but therefore players may move anywhere on their side of the net. The server must obey laws designed to force underhand delivery of the serve, and the receiver must stand still until the service is struck.<br>  <br>  Scoring<br>  Matches comprise of the best of three games. Each game starts at 0-0 (traditionally called "love-all").<br>  <br>  Classic scoring Format<br>  If the serving side wins a rally, it scores a point, and serves again but from the alternate service court. If the receiving side wins the rally, the score remains unchanged and the service passes to the next player in turn. In singles, this is the opponent: in double it's either the partner or, if both players have just had a turn of serving, one of the opponents.<br>  <br>  In men's singles and doubles events, 15 points wins a game. However, if the score reaches 14-14, the side which first reached 14 can choose either to play to 15, or to set the game to 17 points. The final score will reflect the sum of the points won before setting plus the points gained in setting.<br>  <br>  Scoring in women's singles is slightly different. 11 points wins a game and there is the option to set to 13 points at 10-10.<br>  <br>  And Finally...<br>  Players change ends at the end of a game and when the leading score reaches 8 in a game of 15 points (or 6 in a game of 11 points) in the third game.

qIa6m7pnaa	Very ????? this year.    It seems that Mangini has a plan to remove all egos and basket cases from the team.   Which looks bad for this season but good for the long term.    Winslow will be a good trade for us.    He had 2 more "good" years left on his knees.    Rogers if he can't be reasoned with must be traded asap.    We should be able to get some good picks for him.    However if rogers is gone then BJ Raji becomes second on our draft boards for the 5 overall.   I still want Curry at number 1.    With two picks in the 2nd also anything is possible.    My dream would be we keep Rogers, pick curry and matthews for LBs and them draft Alex Mack at center/RG.    4th round go with line depth and take BPA in the 6th.     <br>  <br>  As for the season outlook, we do have a weaker schedule.   If our picks turn out to be game changing players then we could easily go 7-9 or 8-8.     Worst I see us going would be 4-12 again.     However that might not be a bad thing.    SS Mays from USC is going to be an awesome safety in next years draft.     <br>  <br>  Anyways keep your head up.   I like the philosophy and hard nosed "no babying" the players approach so far.

oAjbBLDpaa	Besides the obvious loss in merchandise sales and the overall loss of profit, storylines would be impacted as well.<br>  <br>  Many storylines are continued or stopped because of lack of or large amounts of fan reaction.

I think if the storylines are left to the fans there will be more of a variety. Storylines are so repetitive that I have had to stop watching wrestling for a while now. The same old undertaker vs orton, fools like edge winning the championship and flyweights such as CM Punk and Rey Mysterio being made into world HEAVYWEIGHT championship|`|x4CDslrDaa	Money|`|JYrvt5s8aa	A lot|`|Q1MI6L96aa	On storylines? Negligible, since that would be like fans writing scripts for top drama/sit-com shows. On Merchandising? Much more, since that's an immediate impact...the types of stuff that is bought is tracked and you'll see this through "special" announcements throughout the year.
YnmOzC3Aaa	I am aggravated all of these factors. By this time last year in Free Agency, we had Bernard and Madieu. The Vikings are big spenders and we know Zygi likes to spend money, so why weren't we able to land Housh? The next best and worst option for the team would be Owens, and I am sure Childress wouldn't like that. Rosenfels? Are you kidding? You have a shot at Matt Cassel? Kurt Warner? And you choose Rosenfels? You have a shot a signing Matt Birk, yet you would rather him go to a team we have to play next year, and have even more questions? Sadly, there are more questions than answers for the Vikings. Our last shot to get a good QB would be to go after and trade for Jay Cutler, and maybe signing Owens. But of course, we won't and Childress will be scratching his head at the end of another season where if we are lucky make it to the first round of the playoffs and then get smashed by the Redskins, or the Eagles, or some dumb thing.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	The Vikings certainly aren't helping themselves thus far in free agency. Birk is a big loss... but not paying T.J. may not be as bad as it seems... sure he would've helped the offense, but at what cost? Sage is by no means a good quarterback, he is an average quarterback who was mainly brought in to push Tavares Jackson and provide a mediocre back-up if need be. Getting Sage wasn't a bad move... not great, but not bad either. <br>  <br>  We'll see how they do in the draft. Quarterback is still a big issue, but now they have a hole to fill at center too... and that defense isn't getting any younger. But I wouldn't count them out yet.|`|TWol6a30aa	Typical Vikings!  Looks like they are bombing with hopes of moving the team to LA.  I hear there is a new stadium in Los Angeles being built and the seats are purple..... Makes you wonder what Zigi is up to?
qyATAaeXaa	Your best bet to accomplish something like this in the future is to become trained for Ski Patrol or Ski Instruction by an accredited organization. Develop some contacts and use them to help your "holiday" finances. No one will pay for your transportation for only one week of work, but our resort typically allows other Ski Patrollers to ski for free so as long as they are available if we need their assistance. <br>  <br>  Through my Instructor's contacts I have teaching privileges at three resorts and most likely can get "work" at three others. Additionally, I can ski for free at a bunch of places thanks to Ski Patrol. This didn't come overnight and certainly not through anonymous internet contacts. <br>  <br>  Good Luck. Get involved with the sport beyond casual skiing and you too may reap some rewards.|`|kFlMHSKIaa	Come on, be sensible.  Who's going to give you a job for a week when what you're really looking for is a free holiday.  Get some evening/weekend work and save up for a holiday like everyone else.|`|GVuTWQ6Aaa	it's probably not possible, even if you had the credentials to do work like that, in April anyway.. most ski resorts in the northeast US wind down in march, and stay open for a couple weeks in April.. there not going to put anyone on payroll they don't have too.. if you were employed there as a part time employee, they likely provide season passes, but I doubt they would hire you for 1 week out of the blue....  If you became a ski instructor with PSIA recognition, then maby, but that's a lot of work and experience to get that

HtYGxZcCaa	I don't even want to think of Terrell Owens signing with us. He would kill our chemistry that is going good right now. Peyton Manning doesnt need or want a cancer like TO on this team. Reggie Wayne is a fine #1 reciever who doesnt complain like TO or drop passes like TO. Marvin was a class act when he was here for 13 years. The Colts organization and fans dont want a malcontent like TO here|`|44IT2kmNaa	He would end up slapping around peyton and getting arrested for domestic battery|`|XLXncQu9aa	I seriously doubt he would go to the Colts.  Sure Marvin Harrison is gone but just because he left doesn't mean T.O. would be a good fit there.  Here is what is true.  T.O. has just about run out of chances.  He has one last shot at a team.  It appears he hasn't learned anything.  He did this to himself.  Secondly, now that he was released it sends a message to other teams. T.O. is a large distraction and his options are limited.  He has about 2 or 3 teams that may take a chance on him.  I believe it could be the Bears, or the Ravens and that's about it.  As far as the Colts?  I seriously doubt it.  The Colts are a high class organization and even though Dungy is gone as coach, that team is used to having talent along with classy individuals.  T.O. is not classy and he would not be tolerated there.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	T.O. could never replace the bond Peyton had with Marvin Harrison, as those two are one of the greatest QB-to-WR hook-ups in the history of the NFL.<br>  <br>  I don't imagine Peyton would do much better, if at all, with T.O. on the squad. He drops way more passes than Harrison.|`|wxXguyK3aa	That would be a good fit for him. TO needs an amazing QB because TO easily drops many balls.|`|Gt8NoO2waa	Same, he is just a human. With a huge mouth.|`|KR3IvxNwaa	he would messed up with Wayne and Manning.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	TO with Reggie Wayne on the other side, would equal a new single season touchdown record for Peyton Manning... and I don't mean that he is just barely going to get it... I mean Manning would shatter Brady's record. 55+ TD's for Manning if the Colts go after TO.|`|AA10915692	He would complain because the Colts won, and he caught 2 passes for 12 yds, and Reggie Wayne caught 10 passes for 130 and 2 tds.|`|acaAycEXaa	Manning would never allow that POS on his team! 100% guaranteed! Manning takes the NFL very seriously. He ain't havin' none of that crap!<br>  <br>  Jimmy J-<br>  It is T.O. that would get slapped around!|`|CqFysbOgaa	T.O. is a fag so he would probably sleep with the whole Colts who are also gay

qkyzbkHdaa	Nope, Romo's stats will still be just as bad because he is a horrible quarterback...he turns it over enough on his own. The Cowboys need to get rid of him too if they want to have a successful season because he is always messing it up for them.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Romo should be the next to leave!Really what has he done in Dallas?The only stat that matters is playoffs wins and Romo has zero!|`|wxXguyK3aa	The Cowboys will suffer more than they will benefit from this.|`|Bgpk4npBaa	yes i believe this was the best thing to do for my cowboys and romo they need to get julius peppers now and start maken the locker room a sanctuary instead of a circus|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Romo's passing numbers will plummit, while the Cowboys locker room "bondage" will reach a new high.|`|s9Pwnb87aa	Romo is mediocre at best...T.O. actually shed a tear for that bum?<br>  and you are on here dogging T.O.?|`|DymLS3Nyaa	NOPE|`|oHJ0ZEFqaa	It's a toss up. We'll see how Romo does without T.O. in the lineup for the first time. It'll either break him because the attention generated by T.O. is gone and will help the opposing Def with covering Whitten (basically lessening the effect of his go-to guy at TE). This would hamper his production leading to more or less the same ratio of TD to Int but less magnitude as the loss of a weapon presses the defense on what is still there, lessening their productivity.<br>  <br>  It could make his ratio better now that their isn't a megaphone yelling in his ear to throw him the ball. Better team chemistry would then lead to more success. <br>  <br>  I personally think he'll be more or less the same, but leaning towards a less productive season.|`|S1rp2L2Waa	I think that greatly improve their level of play, the real problem is that Romo seems to lose concentration on the game, or make moves that he should not do, and this often forced to make mistakes<br>  <br>  excuse my English is not very good, I hope you understand.<br>  <br>  Kisses and Hugs baby!!|`|RTaimrg7aa	They will go up just because Romo doesn't always have to look to TO first with his crying about wanting the ball|`|Pj3V07yaaa	ha ha ha na to was that whole team romo is nothin without him ROMO IS GAYYYYYYYYYYYY|`|c755a7ce9c9e50f79ac4b65b75c2db62aa	romo is overrated. doesnt matter who his receivers are he's a bum.|`|ME62Mtv4aa	no way|`|5B6w8mxVaa	yea witten will be the first target, then roy so we will see what happens.|`|hbP6ykjpaa	Romo is overrated!|`|AA10522974	No.  I think he is a over-rated quarterback.

oUvnMHpRaa	I just don't see that happening, there was a lot of bad blood when he left and he didn't have much nice to say about almost everyone associated with the team up to and including the water boys.  Ok that's a little overboard but not by much.  The heat between him and McNabb was pretty intense for a while.  In addition to the team I am not sure the fans would allow him back in the city much less the football stadium.  The few Philly fans that I know, really can't stand the guy and if he showed up on their field it may make the Santa Claus incident look like a friendly neighborhood snowball fight.|`|34VXCyvVaa	No, he's burned that bridge, too.|`|mTSOJKlyaa	no they wotn want him back after what he did|`|oHJ0ZEFqaa	No absolutely not. This question has been brought up a lot and I still don't why. Yes, the Eagles need a WR. But are they that desperate that they need to bring back the cancer that broke the team apart the next year leading them to have the worst season in recent history? I think not.

oqQjnpfGaa	DON"T DO THIS TRADE<br>  <br>  The reasons are obvious. Two All-Star Caliber players for one excellent-assist All-Star point-guard is not an equal trade.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, I love Deron Williams. IF KG doesn't come back from his injuries, then this trade will be quite sweet (RJ for DW is an excellent trade!!).<br>  <br>  It is just that at this point I still think KG will come back, and RJ is just quite consistent with points (and a little of everything) to back you up.<br>  <br>  Overall, this trade could be balanced if you get another player in return, and make it someone who is quite consistent like RJ.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|N8wNmQShaa	Deron Williams is hot right now, but I think you would be giving to much up. I guess it depends on your point guards you have on your roster, But I wouldnt do it unless you really needed to improve your PG position.

QQqhzuNDaa	Of course it is not. Could you imagine if they allowed it in football? Football and the other sports have the class to keep it in check. The only reason hockey allows it is to satiate the thirst for violence of the creeps in the stands.|`|ULw1777caa	Yes, it can change the tide of games at times.  The staged fights are not so necessary, though.|`|WrDGhduxaa	It is a tradition. When a team has a good player the other team tries to put him off his game or out of the game with hard hits, legal or illegal.<br>  Each team has an enforcer who does the fighting for the good player.<br>  Usually a fight is to get rid of team frustrations when they think the officials are letting someone get away with cheap shots, or it is a pay back. <br>  I doubt you can eliminate fighting completely from the game.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Fighting keeps the following from happening:<br>  <br>  -A huge increase in stickwork and stick fights (which is great; you want strong fit athletes swinging super-light composite sticks at each other; do you have any idea how much damage a stick can cause as opposed to a fist?).<br>  -An increase in headshots (great for a spike in concussions, brain trauma, and guys becoming vegetables) and king hits.<br>  -A spike in boarding penalties (because once again, having a guy go head first in a vulnerable position into the boards where paralysis is a possible outcome...hey, that'll be great, eh?)<br>  -A total and absolute loss of respect (no worries, it's only the foundation that the game is built on), and guys being held accountible for their actions (because that sucks to no end). I think we all enjoy seeing guys run around and do cheap shots on star players without having to answer the bell? It'll be AWESOME when a superstar takes a cheap shot and goes out for the season. I mean, who wants to watch a superstar play when there's some 4th line pest with next to no skill out there instead? <br>  <br>  As barbaric and horrible as this sounds, fighting makes guys accountible for their actions.  <br>  <br>  To clarify an often-forgotten point: fighting is against the rules.  The NHL rulebook has a huge section which cover fighting (i.e. fisticuffs).  It's punishable by, at a minimum, a 5-minute major penalty, with additional penalties for instigating a fight, being a 3rd man in, or leaving the bench to start a fight.  <br>  <br>  If I may, I'd suggest you read the book "The Code", which actually explains hockey's unwritten code, and why it exists.<br>  <br>  Other sports: In 2004, the NBA had a bench-clearing brawl go into the stands.  Within seven days, a US college football game in South Carolina had a similar bench-clearing fight decend into a near-riot.  Pregame brawls in US college football are common (and never result in ejections or penalties)...but hey- keep blaming hockey!  What's the over/under on baseball bench-clearing brawls a year...40?

Is it necessary... I think yes. It is part of the game. It is traditiion. It is a way to rally your team to give them the confidence and get them pumped up. Its how you back up your teamates, too. Personally i dont see why not? I mean who does it affect honestly. Its not like you go to a fight to watch a hockey game... you go to a hockey game and may perhaps see a fight. Fighting also brings more people to the arena then it keeps away...|`|0qNbEif3aa	More fans love than hate it. The players don't seem to mind it. The coaches put certain players on the ice at certain points in the game solely to fight. <br>  <br>  It's exciting, tradition (not like it just started happening yesterday, it's always been part of the game), and it can change the momentum of a game.|`|AA10068004	Is it necessary to keep asking this question over and over again, considering its been asked about a million times in this section already??

They went hand in hand, you couldn't do one without the other. <br>     In today's NHL the necessity of it has fallen off for some. That's mainly due to the league altering the penalties to the teams after a fight has happened. In passed years the NHL has made the two offending players go to the box for five minutes, and they were replaced on the ice for 5 on 5 play. Now that doesn't happen! The fighters aren't replaced so there is more 4 on 4 hockey(like back in the 80's and early 90's). Offensively challenged teams can't win that way so fighting has declined. Along with suspensions for the fallowing games, players are just less likely to fight. The league is trying to look like they are doing their best to minimize that aspect of the game. If they wanted to the NHL could do away with it completely. The NHL wants to still appeal to those of us who enjoy that style of play.<br>  YES, it is necessary for the game of hockey! Goals and fights put people in the seats. The Wings and Avalanche was the biggest hockey draw for a long time. Arguably the best rivalry in sports. You can't tell me it wasn't due in part to the fact that the two teams hated each other and fought almost evey game...|`|gI44aIddaa	Yes it is necessary.  How many people are going to ask this question?  What is so hard to understand?  An armed society is a polite society.  That phrase is a testament to the right to bear arms, but it also holds true for hockey.  If you know that any cheap shot, dirty hit, or trash talk, all of which are usually aimed at skilled, finesse players, will result in harsh consequences (like getting knocked the frick out) that knowledge of what will happen tends to deter players from taking cheap shots.  Goons need to know that they cant bully anybody they please, because often times theres a bully on the other bench who wont be too happy.<br>  <br>  Since the gary bettman and the NHL's administration has been cracking down on fighting over the past decade, moreso in recent years, cheap shots and dirty hits on players who dont get paid to play an overly physical game are much more prevalent.  Cheap teams like Anaheim, Colorado, and Nashville (I dont care what anybody else says, watch them play the Red Wings and youll see their frustration take over and theyll resort to playing a cheap game) try to get the Red Wings off of their game by cheap hits from behind, unchecked roughing that should be called by the refs, hacks, and often times, instigating fights.  However, often times they try to instigate fights with a european dangler or playmaker that does not get paid to fight or lay people out.<br>  <br>  For many years (we'll call it the old hall of fame era with the likes of yzerman, shanahan, hull, fedorov, robitaille, etc.) the Red Wings were able to generate offense at will, and when somebody made a run at Stevie Y or one of the Russians, except Vladdy, who kicked ***, the player trying to intimidate our captain or a goal scorer would be jacked in the face by Brendan Shanahan, Marty Lapointe, Joe Kocur, Darren McCarty, etc.  However, over the past 5-10 years the Red Wings have changed to more of a European, puck control system (a period which we will call the future hall of fame era) which was sometimes lacking in grit and intensity.  Recently Darren McCarty has come back to town, Aaron Downey has been with us for the past couple seasons, and our Eurotalent has become a little better accustomed to the physical North American game, but for a while, cheap teams would take shots at our smaller, young and talented players like Datysuk, Zetterberg, Filppula, Hudler, and even veterans like Nicklas Lidstrom.<br>  <br>  This cheap play went on unreprimanded for a few seasons and it took Ken Holland too long to realize that we needed some enforcers.  Enforces are key to the game, and if you watch what is happening to hockey and how Gary Bettman is changing what he has no right to taint, youll see how taking fighting out of the game is a change for the worst.  Anybody who truly knows hockey knows that fighting is necessary at any level (at least high school level and above).<br>  <br>  Hockey is a chippy, physical sport and there is a vast array of athletes that play the game.  From talented finesse players, to talented defensive specialists, to bonecrunching hitters, to power forwards, to goons and aggitators, the diverse nature of the game creates an unbalance.  This delicate balance is maintained by ensuring that goons dont beat up on the guys whose jobs are to score, not fight.<br>  <br>  I really use a lot of parentheses.|`|oWd07vsVaa	fun to watch o yeah, It's a part of the game you know the have enforcers who purposly fight

MEwILtzBaa	I believe I answered this question before but here goes again.<br>  First off Tharanga has a shrapnel wound to his chest but it was superficial, thank God and it was Jaywardne who was shot in the leg.<br>  <br>  Well since I was there when this happened (Heading to work, just about to get on Main Boulevard Gulberg when the police came rushing) I can easily say that one of the terrorists was what one would think of as a Taliban. The other's didn't look Pakistani, were too well dressed, and too well coordinated. They knew what they were doing and had a freakishly similar manner as those that committed the heinous act in Mumbai. They all wore backpacks loaded with ammunition and they knew the entire layout of Gulberg and were confident to boot. <br>  I'm a foreigner who has been living in Pakistan for the past 5 years and up until today, I have never been scared of going to work. The majority of Pakistani's are kind, helpful people, including the security squad that came running onto the road to get us out of the area safely. This incident has damaged their reputation so horribly and as if they weren't persecuted enough, now this. What I can say is this, I actually was looking foward to day three of tests having gotten the opportunity to see the first two days first hand. I never DREAMED that this would happen and one my usual route to work! <br>  They put up a memorial for the police officers and traffic warden that lost their lives at the Liberty Roundabout. God Bless thier souls for laying down their lives to protect Lahore. What shames me is that they had to pay for their lives for the screw up of the newly appointed SP of security. The first two days, the SL cricket team came via Canal Road to Ferozpur Road to Gaddafi Stadium but on the third day (the day the Punjab government collapsed due to a supreme court ruling and the day the SP of Security was changed by the Governor) they came from Main Boulevard to Gaddafi Stadium. If anyone is to blame, it's the cowards that did this an the new SP for his idiotic actions!<br>   <br>  All I can say is that my prayer are with the Sri Lankan Cricket team and those that fell in the line of duty. You lot are the true heroes!|`|arjadO5daa	Thank lord that they are all safe. Cricket wouldn't have been the same if one cricket player died.

Perhaps, as per the media, the motive behind this attack was the release of Lakhvi (a terrorist, whom the Paki police has taken under custody as one of the suspects behind Mumbai Terror attack)!

5bf08180c9f9ff092c1cac9f7edea283aa	drink liqueur. flasks are handy and liqueur is quicker! but backpacks are always good for carrying large amounts of beer. Stash it in the woods where no one will look or in a big pile of snow and keep going back to it. That's what my friends do with beer.|`|HmMjETu5aa	um... pack it in your coat. Your body heat should keep it from freezing, but it'll stay chilled. Your main problem with that will be if you bail, then your cans will hurt like hell when you're ribs smash into them. And you know drinking alcohol isn't the best idea when skiing anyway. If you get drunk, you'll really injure yourself. If you're going to bring beer, bring O'Douls, you won't get drunk, and u can still enjoy your beer. Hope this helped.|`|k1C70y8raa	My ski jacket has enough space to hold 5 cans, so thats how i do it.  Drink on the chairlift.  Ive never found a better way.  Sorry bro.|`|qyATAaeXaa	I can't tell you what choices to make when it come to drinking while engaged in any sort of snowsports. I don't think mixing the two is ever a good idea, but there's no difference in drinking on the chairlift or drinking in the lodge and continuing to ski or ride.<br>  <br>  I strongly suggest that you find some means to either eliminate your cans before you take to the slopes or you dispose of them in the proper manner. That means packing them out or putting them in a trash can...not chucking them off the chair into the woods.<br>  <br>  The best bet is to keep your booze in the car and enjoy a few on lunch or on breaks and keep the alcohol off the slopes all together. If you must take alcohol with you on the slopes then I suggest you put the containers in a backpack. Beer gets warm in a Hydration system and in your pockets. <br>  <br>  The fact that you refer to a backpack as a "bookbag" makes me think you are under the legal drinking age. Should you be caught with alcohol on the slopes you could face criminal charges and more than likely any skiing privileges will be revoked for at least the rest of the season.|`|TFhf5skNaa	You could fill a Camelback with beer. Keep in mind, it will be tough to get the taste out of that thing even after vigorous washing.  Load up your pockets or just keep running back out to the car every few runs.  <br>  <br>  One could make the argument to wait till after you get off the steep, icy tree covered mountain to get crocked, but if you wanted someone to give you a lecture on responsibility you would have asked your parenents, and not us.  <br>  <br>  Be safe.|`|a528b1cbba399ee774c9110281f42878aa	Take them up on the lift. Find a nice spot off the main run and dig a hole. Remember where you put them and each time down the run you have a nice cold beer weighting for you. Be sure to leave a marker so you know where they are. But hide them well enough so they don't get snagged.|`|jTFdG8xqaa	If you drink on the slopes your an idiot. Imagine how hard it is to drive drunk. Now make that really hard and strap some razors to your feet. Your an idiot for even suggesting this. I hope you land in the trees and don't take out some poor kid who's having a good time, without boos.|`|Ir7JA6IUaa	Wow, and I thought the guy I saw yesterday smoking a cigarette while skiing was an idiot......
LdJFFvSVaa	Yes...
Ez0z7Of3aa	Bargnani: a lot was expected from him because he was drafted 1st. He's slowly getting the hang of things. He will not be an all-star but he will make a great complimentary player.<br>  <br>  Belinelli: There's future for him. He's a starter for a bad team which is good in a way. other teams can see how good he really he is then they'll snatch him<br>  <br>  Gallinari: most unfamiliar among the 3 but he was good during the gae vs the magic i think. <br>  <br>  Better among the 3, for now I'll say Bargnani with Belinelli 2nd. gallinari can needs more years in the league to improve himself.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	Both are italian and still young but Bargnani has better prospect because he's a starter for his team<br>  <br>  Bargnani:the next Nowitzki<br>  <br>  Gallinari:Could be good player if he can stay healthy<br>  <br>  Belinneli:almost same as Ginobili|`|XuNbQI0Baa	Actually Bargnani is  better,but for the future i see good prospectives for Gallinari.
21J0IIZbaa	Bargnani<br>  He is a skill player with size that will develop. He will make the all star team 2-3 time in his career. Belinelli will be a starter but a role player. Gallinari will be a career journeymen.|`|38f16af5e5fc1e44e0b50a5058b0ad41aa	Bargnani, the other two haven't done much yet.

czMprYUvaa	um you mean disqualified? if your coach gets a red card but thats rare, or a yellow card, but that's only if they curse they ref out. or if there aren't enough players on your team that show up to the game, you have to forfeit. But i mean just losing a game there's a lot of reasons, weak passing, getting stuck in side out hahaha too many errors. like hitting out, serving out, or serving and hitting into the net, or netting when you block, etc.|`|wp2mIqTcaa	it just depends|`|lzoJDeBZaa	If you mean in a game, Its <br>  ? Lack of even trying<br>  ? Being mean to the other team<br>  ? Cursing <br>  Theres a few more but those are all i got ;D|`|tfkBHH9eaa	Not trying hard enough.

zTJK0h6gaa	i don't know...you can try to eat pasta like my Italian friends that playing soccer..i think that you need carbohydrates..|`|xHwnTjJqaa	You need to eat healthy not only before practice, but every day! No soda, unless it's organic, and that kind only once a week. <br>  No fast food, lots of fruits and veggies. The easiest way for me is fruit shakes, I just dump a bunch of fresh or frozen fruit in the blender with a banana and fat free yogurt every morning, and sometimes for lunch or dinner. Eat lots of spaghetti and that kind of food, pizza is ok only if doesn't have lots of cheese or meat. The best kind is veggie with hardly any cheese, cheese is not that great for you! Drink fat-free milk, go real easy on butter and whipped cream. <br>  Also, if you are tiring out easy, start by taking looooong walks, then work up to running/walking/sprinting/juggling the ball or whatever you feel like doing with the ball for more than an hour. Be sure you can run/jog for at least 45 min, that's a half right there! Once you get up to that, work to 90 min! <br>  Good luck!
AA11073512	That is a tough call. Your 3 keeper hitters are sick. I don't think I would take Peavy over all of those hitters, maybe over Ichiro, Phillips and Roberts. I would take one of those guys, probably Manny, with your first pick, and then try and grab a pitchers with your next pick or two. You don't need steals at all, since those 3 guys will get 100 steals for you, thats why I'd take Manny over Pedroia.|`|N8wNmQShaa	Manny I am sure will put up some great numbers.|`|ajfIcJYhaa	Dustin Pedroia. There are not many great 2nd baseman out there.

xQFWjFyZaa	Don't keep a closer. That is just pointless. Keeping three players basically means you're starting your draft in round 4. Would you take Nathan or Rivera(if that even is Mariano) in round 3? I sure wouldn't. They'll still be there in round 8 if you want them.<br>  <br>  I would keep Ichiro. I'm not a big fan, and I think he's a bit overrated as a Fantasy player, but he's definitely better than your other options. He'll give you 35-45 steals and a .300+ average. I would probably use him as trade bait though.|`|Xi6KGBG0aa	def ichiro<br>  <br>  he will win SB Average and Hits for you<br>  <br>  if you are goin to take a closer even though i dont think you should i would def go with nathan|`|AA49cfdraa	Ichiro, or see if you can somehow trade.  Nathan is a lot better of a close than Rivera, but still not worth taking a closer in the top 4 or 5.|`|ajfIcJYhaa	Rivera because you can count on him to get at least 30 saves possibly more. <br>  <br>  Nathan is younger but you are only playing with him for 1 season. Your not planning for the future in fantasy baseball.|`|J1w0Ewy0aa	Joe Nathan, he's younger than Rivera and will continue to be great for a few years.|`|eSL9tWnQaa	packerfan got this right IMO.
Y4mz8BShaa	Yes. It should just screw off.<br>  In the field, that thing is quite useless. It's a Kalashnikov lower with an LE stock, and a sub carbine upper receiver. Sometimes I wonder if the people who slap these things together were dropped on their heads.<br>  <br>  Just want to warn you it's not very good quality. I never have, and never will trust AirsoftMegastore's specs.
oHJ0ZEFqaa	I still believe Cassel was a product of the system. Honestly, you put anybody behind the patriots offensive line and give them Randy Moss and Wes Welker to throw to and 9 times out of 10 they will succeed. We will see how Cassel does next year but I am not sold on him having a huge impact. I actually thought there was potential in that Thigpen kid. Yeah he had some horrid games but I think that was more a result of him being thrown into the starting position from a third stringer. He made significant improvements down the stretch and did a good job statistically as well. Wasn't it that defense that let them down a couple times last year? I know that Defense Wins Championships is a tired saying and sometimes doesn't completely work but I am more a believer of the saying that "You can't win a championship without a good defense". We'll see what Cassel does, but I am still skeptic.|`|iMGSaC0qaa	I don't think so. Look at the weapons Matt Cassel has last season with the Patriots and he had barley and average to above average year. He goes to a Chiefs team with basically nothing. Larry Johnson wants out of Kansas City. Tony Gonzalez is still back and fourth about wanting to leave. And 9 time pro bowler offensive gaurd Brian Waters wants traded as well. <br>  <br>  Dwayne Bowe dropped a bunch of passes last season that he should have caught. Other than Bowe, they have no Wide Reciever help. If Gonzalez stays, he'll be the go to guy almost always. <br>  <br>  I don't think Cassel will be much of an impact at all until they rebulid that offensive line and get another quality Wide Out. They also need desperate help with Linebackers and Pass Rushers. Yeah i know they got Mike Vrabel, but he can't play 4 positions. <br>  <br>  Chiefs still have a lot of work to be done. Surprised with as much cap room they have, 2nd most in the NFL,  they haven't reached out to sign any free agents. They are like 40 million under the cap. Come on Chiefs! Do something with that money!|`|uwms4NyDaa	This is a tough prediction at the time. The Chiefs have no depth at WR and have one solid TE with Tony Gonzales. Dwayne Bowe is an exceptional receiver and still has a lot of time left in the league. I feel that Matt Cassell has the potential to be a stand-out QB if his receivers will make plays for him|`|856503b3f4fc0e94b055e5fbebd79accaa	Yes he will make a significant impact, on their budget.  By week 6 he will be a 14.95 million dollar backup.|`|hbP6ykjpaa	He will help the offence, but the defence will still suck!|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Yes he will ....................|`|AA10776364	It will depend on the Chiefs other offseason moves.  They need to shore up the offensive line, so that MC can have time to throw.  I don't look for LJ to be here next year, as he has expressed on a number of occasions he wants traded.  He does however have Bowe and Gonzalez, and look for KC to pick up another WR in the third round.|`|FtkoBEVpaa	With the exception of the Chargers the AFC West is pretty weak so I look for the Chiefs to make a run at the playoffs.  In order for that to happen, Cassell has got to make an impact.|`|mTSOJKlyaa	no he will be mediocore|`|RTaimrg7aa	So much depends on playcalling.  I think Billacheet knew full well what he was doing with the 2nd round he got.|`|DymLS3Nyaa	YES

lH2x3gn3aa	well i dont know the recipe your talking about but i swear by this one:<br>  <br>  <br>  Take 2 lbs of chicken liver and 32oz. can of garlic salt.<br>  Lay liver out in layers, sprinkle a heafty amount of garlic salt on it. Add next layer so on and so forth until the liver is all used. Let sit for a couple hours outside. It doesn't have to be in the sun. After a couple hours take the liver and dump into a bucket and start stirring, every 3 or 4 stirs add some more garlic. Do this until you have about 1/4 cup of garlic left. Put it in the garage for about 9 or 10 days, make sure its covered. When you get ready to use it dump the rest of the garlic salt in, stir, and go fishin.<br>  The salt will make the garlic alot tougher. You can use a single wire hook doing it this way.<br>  Instead of Garlic try Anise, Vanilla or what ever you want. Just make sure you add salt (alot) because this is what makes it tough and stay on the hook. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK FISHIN|`|q8dX0MsNaa	doc guards his recipe jealously. if anyone gave it out, he'd be a dead man.

dVk9vpmbaa	It will be hard to run sub 2 indoors because of the stress fracture. <br>  <br>  However, sub 2 outdoors is very likely. I broke 2 for the first time when I was doing 66s for 8x400 workouts with about 90 seconds rest. I also had about 53 second 400 speed.|`|WrDGhduxaa	If you are doing 400 repeats you should be doing them at race pace or faster. If you are running 1:02 you will not be able to race faster than that.<br>  You have the speed to run a sub 2:00, but you should be careful if you have a stress fracture.<br>  Outdoors is a long way off so don't get into too much of a hurry.|`|Ia0v7Nx9aa	there is definetly a chance for you to make it under 2 minutes. All you have to do is keep training, and be careful about that stress fracture. The most important thing to do is make sure that you don't reinjure yourself

mMFJrPbvaa	Like I say for rock climbing, the same thing can be said for backpacking, there is being in shape and then being in shape for rock climbing or in your case being in shape for backpacking, since you`ll be using muscles you didnt know you had.  No one on here can tell you what your trail speed will be.  There is no possible way some one over the internet can do that for you without knowing you.  <br>  <br>  There are so many variables from your pack weight to elevation gain to how trail ready you really are.  I`d say your best bet is to do some weekend trip either on the trail you are going on or one with similar or harder terrain and then extrapolate from your experience from the shorter weekend trips.  Consider it a shakedown hike.  Bring the gear you will be using, this way you can tweak it before you are ion the long haul.  At the end of the weekend go through your pack and pull out the things you didnt touch.  It is so easy to over pack, especially with clothes that you will never wear.<br>  <br>  Feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions
qusKbEmBaa	Yes you should either play the 2 guard position or<br>  the Small forward position. You would fit good in a team like<br>  Gonzaga. Who needs better guards and better shooters.<br>  You should really try to get noticed and dont wait until you get older.<br>  Hope i helped.<br>  ( i need the points so i was wondering if you can vote me as<br>  best answer, thanks)|`|9m9gHZhpaa	you should play small forward, or 2 guard like you said.|`|FfYEmXaEaa	First of all you dont get to choose your position... typically it is pretty much already pre-determined by your size or by the coach.<br>  Second of all if you dont know what position you are then how the hell are you playing division one basketball because really only the best high school players get that opportunity and most have been playing for at least three years of varsity basketball.<br>  And third if you do not gain weight you have no chance.|`|AA10248312	You said "somewhere at the 2 or 3 guard"...  A "3" isn't a guard.   <br>  <br>  Talk to your coach, why are you asking us what position you should play and how much weight you should put on?  What the hell do any of us know, we've never seen you play.|`|5kRne5d2aa	i really don't think you should worry about the position cuz it's already determined, you probably aren't going to play division 1 ball if your asking us this question.

It's great exercise.  A great way to meet people.  They have tennis socials where you can meet 30 or more people in 2 hours.  The club I play at has people in their 70's and 80's still running around the court.  I am convinced it's from playing tennis all their lives.  I have been playing seriously for about 2 years and I love it.  I tell everyone they should play.|`|buCtn7guaa	i think for me yes, it worths playing. i was about 15 kg overweight in Jan 2008 and i played tennis twice a week each for 2 hours (with lots of breaks of course hehe) until now and i lost 10 kg already. compared to this fact, my jogging is pretty much useless :p so yeah, i think tennis worth playing. and it's fun as well :)<br>  hope this helps :)|`|7rweJQ5jaa	Yes its really good for your heart and your coordination. Plus you get to meet a lot of new people, and its really fun.|`|MJNyjiESaa	yea. its good excersize and its fun.|`|PWIcfCbxaa	YES|`|r5h7TmWJaa	Definitely! I hate sports, but I am in love with Tennis.

OAEuYZkZaa	If you are talking about in the USA, it would probably have been the Winchester Model 1873 in various calibers and the Colt Model P, aka Peacemaker  or Single-Action Army Revolver.  .45 Long Colt was the caliber used by the Army, but .44040 WCF and .38-40 WCF were more popular on the civilian market.<br>  <br>  The reason .44-40's and .38-40's were more popular than the .45 Colt was the fact that you could purchase a Winchester rifle in those calibers but not in .45 Colt.

The 19th century is the period from 1800-1899.Roughly the middle of the industrial revolution, and a time of transition. Guns went from flint locks which had been used for hundreds of years to cartridge guns....in a period of less than a hundred years!..Popular would indicate fashionable since it couldnt be based on population it must be based on a certain period and since guns changed dramaticly during this period then you have find out  what type of ignition system seemed to last the longest, I'll give you a hint...it wasnt cartridge.

The .50-140-700- 3 1/4" means that the caliber was .50, the case was loaded with 140 grains of gunpowder, firing a 700 grain bullet and the case was 3 1/4" long.  This cartridge was chambered only in Sharps rifles and was not terribly common, it was not introduced until after the great massacre of the buffalo herds.  The .50-110-300 Winchester was another .50 caliber cartridge loaded with 110 grains of gunpowder and a 300 grain bullet.  Due to the lighter bullet the Winchester produced considerably higher velocities than the Sharps did with it's larger powder charge and heavier bullet.  We are talking about a velocity of 2225 feet per second for the Winchester compared to 1555 feet per second in the Sharps. The Winchester cartridge was introduced in the late 1890's and was chambered only in the Winchester Model 1886.<br>  <br>  The most powerful handgun of the 19th Century depends on whether you are talking about revolvers, multi-barreled pistols, or muzzle-loaders.<br>  <br>  Webley, Tranter and a few other English and European gun-makers built massive revolvers chambered for a .577 caliber cartridge.  But in spite of the huge bore diameter, the cartridges were extremely short and used a very small powder charge.  IIRC the .577 Tranter was loaded with a 250 or 399 grain bullet and only 18 grains of gunpowder.  Velocities on the huge bullets was well under 500 fps.  By comparison, the .45 Long Colt cartridge used 28 grains of gunpowder to propel a 255 grain bullet at around 900 fps and the .44-40-200 Winchester Centerfire used 40 grains of powder to ppropela 200 grain bullet at around 1200 fps.<br>  <br>  In addition to revolvers, there were a number of extremely powerful multi-barreled pistols available in the 19th Century.  A number of british firms produced double-barreled Howdah pistols chambered in calibers up to .72 caliber (12 gauge shotgun size) and Lancaster produced a four barreled pistol chambered for the standard BBritish Army rifle cartridge, the .577/.450 Martini-Henry.  The double-barreled pistol that is probably the most famous and easily recognizable is the Remington Double Derringer chambered for the .41 Short Rimfire, powerful it wasn't!  using about 10 grains of gunpowder this anemic cartridge propelled a 100 grain bullet at around 300 fps.  A friend told me of once seeing a fellow shot in the back with an old .41Derringerr  The man was wearing many layers of clothing due to the cold and the bullet failed to even penetrate his skin.<br>  <br>  Some muzzle-loading pistols were very powerful.  The old Sea-Service Tower Flintlock Pistols issued to the British Navy  and Army were 75 caliber smooth bore pistols.  Their accuracy wasatrociouss but when they hit their target at close range it would hammer a man flat.  The .54 caliber percussion pistol used by the US Army in the 1840s was not only fairly accurate, but powerful enough to "knock down a horse and his rider.".<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.<br>  <br>  Doc|`|tuULGJS6aa	British guns used in Africa have the lead I'd say. There were huge rifles in nominal 4 bore, but most were really 5 to 6 bore. One of about 5.5 bore fired a 1250 grain (2.86 ounce avoirdupois) round lead ball or an 1800 grain (4.11 oz) conical bullet of .98" diameter. Sir Samuel Baker had a custom rifle he said was 2 bore. A true 2 bore would fire a 3500 grain round lead ball. Howdah pistols with four barrels were made in .577" and with two barrels in .75". As for the US, there was a .50-140 buffalo rifle in different versions. A display had a .70-150, but it's uncertain whether such a rifle was made except for exhibition. The numbers mean that the bullet was .70" in diameter, and there were 150 grains of powder behind it. Single shot percussion pistols were made in .54" caliber, and Remington rolling block pistols were made for the .50-70 and .45-70 cartridges.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	Rifles: For sheer power I would say either the <br>  From America the 50-90 berdan sharps rifle<br>  Europe one of England's finest big bore doubles. <br>  <br>  For rate of fire and power I would say a lever gun in .45-70<br>  <br>  For a hand gun <br>  America the Walker Dragoon<br>  Europe the Horse Pistols (so big that they had to be carried on a horse)|`|rcpZ6n7Zaa	Though not a rifle (shotgun), the biggest baddest gun ever created (in my opinon) not for military use?

Every one of us has problems and distractions, but we still go to work and do what we are asked to do.  The Cowboy's problem goes beyond Owens.  There is too much Hollywood in Dallas.  They need to just play ball the way they are capable.  The coach isn't direct enough.  He doesn't push his players to be the best they can be.  They are not challenged.  The Cowboys also do not have a leader.  Someone needs to take charge and lead.  Currently, they are not a "Team".   Loosing Owens will not make them a Champion.  You have to play like a Champion every Sunday to be a Champion.|`|FtkoBEVpaa	Okay I understand the comparison to Shockey, but Tiki Barber?  How can you say Tiki Barber was a locker room cancer?

Meaning that they won't be better w/o their 2nd best receiver (I'm gonna go ahead and say Jason Witten is their best.) Roy Williams will underachieve his whole career. And Romo is overrated and isn't really a whole lot better than Drew Bledsoe was a few years ago. That's the true story on why their offense is not as good as it should be.|`|AA11220992	I think they will not be as good until they get used to him being gone. most of Romo's touchdown passes where to T.O.

Now I'm seeing those same people saying the Cowboys are stupid for letting him go. Nobody is looking at the big picture. Right  after the season, Jones said he would change his approach to the way he deals with the team, and Wade Phillips said the same thing. After that, they immediately cut Pacman. Now they have cut TO, who is arguably one of the best receivers in the league. Cutting TO also had a negative effect on the salary cap and it would have been cheaper to keep him. But it sends out a strong message to the rest of the team that nobody is expendable. What better way is there to instill discipline on a team than by getting rid of the biggest distraction, even if it means getting rid of one of their best playmakers? I'm not sure how this will affect the offensive production, but I commend Jerry Jones for finally thinking outside his own ego.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	I don't know about the Cowboys improving since they didn't win a play off game the three years he was with them or the fact they didn't win a play off game since 1996 he wasn't a Cowboy those years.

WLXFAeSnaa	The Cavs|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	I'm a Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics fan but I think the best all-around team right now is Los Angeles Lakers. They have the complete recipe a basketball team needed. They've got a young and a promising center, Andrew Bynum, who should stay healthy to help LA win their first ring since Shaq left. They've got Pau Gasol, a big man that can score if he wants to (too bad he played bad last year in the Finals). They've got Lamar Odom, a small forward that is not good as LBJ is but also an all-around player that KB24 needed to run the Lakers. They've got Kobe Bryant, the greatest shooting guard playing in the league right now and of course Derek Fisher who can provide leadership and experience. Not to mention the depth of it's bench (Ariza, Farmar, Vujacic, Walton, etc.). This is the best line-up that NBA have right now (Boston does have a great lineup too - KG, Pierce, Allen, Rondo but doesn't have a dominant center amd also have deep bench players led by Starbury).|`|qusKbEmBaa	I think the Lakers are the best overrall team in the NBA right<br>  now. The Boston Celtics are way too overrated. The lakers are<br>  dangerous when Kobe can hit the 3 ball and they have a huge<br>  advantage against other teams down low in the post with Chris Mihm<br>  and Andrew Bynum who are both very young players and are getting<br>  better everyday.<br>  Hope i helped<br>  ( i need the points so i was wondering if you can vote me as<br>  best answer, thanks)|`|IkOHh5X8aa	The cavaliers|`|9d06cffec852de9a7554521403313f02aa	I think the Celtics are the best "all around team" in that they have better teamwork and cohesiveness as a unit than any other team.  Their team defensive schemes are nearly impeccable, every guy on the team is willing to take charges and dive for loose balls, and Rondo has their offense running like a well-oiled machine.  Even their stars are almost too unselfish, passing up a good shot for a great one on nearly every possession.<br>  <br>  All that being said though, I think the Cavs will win the championship.  Lebron is just too dominant to be stopped down the stretches of games.|`|HE6S36fQaa	the Lakers or the cavalaries|`|Ct6NMwwjaa	Pistons according to last game<br>  all 5 starters with 16 or more|`|JD5NQxeNaa	The Jazz. I think the Spurs are the best team, but talent wise 1-12 the Jazz are the deepest. With Gooden on board in SA that can change though.<br>  <br>  Take a look at the Jazz roster. 4 bonified All-stars in D.Will, C.Booz, AK47, and Mehmet. Then you got 2 up and coming All-star young guys in Paul Millsap and Ronnie Brewer. CJ Miles can score, Kyle Korver is a sharpshooter that can go off from 3 off the bench, Harp is a great physical defender and can score, Brevin Knight has been a solid PG for years now one of best court vision players in the league and does not turn the ball over, Ronnie Price can defend and hit the 3. They stacked. The Spurs are pretty stacked too.|`|7zo0ZOThaa	Cavs

No matter what team he joins, he'll blame everything that goes wrong on the quarterback. The only way he'll do well on another team is if they put him on a team with a famous quarterback that you can't bash, like one of the Manning brothers.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	Problem is no elite team will really want TO. He causes to many headaches and whines to much when things do not go the way he wants. TO is all about me, and that makes him a real poison to teams and teams spirit.<br>  He will get a job but it will not be with a high quality team, and no high quality QB will want to put up with his mouth, in the locker room or in the press.|`|AA12059929	I think it could be the best thing for T.O. and the Cowboys.

He is one of the best players to play the game, he used the performance enhancing drugs, but it wasnt illegal in the MLB.

Watch for Roy Williams and Witten to have big years this season.<br>  <br>  How did TO help Romo last year?  By receiving for 40 yards or less in 8 games or by only receiving for 100+ yards in 3 games last year.  TO has had a great career, but he is past his prime...I don't understand where these people who think TO is still elite get their stats from.  His numbers have gotten worse in each of his last 4 seasons...and who did he perform well against last season?  The 49ers and Cincinnati...big deal.|`|DWJOMWQ8aa	Yes, I think so. Romo is only a good QB because players like TO and Marion Barber clean up after his mistakes by making great plays.<br>  <br>  TO is probably the best WR in the league IMO.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	When your team leader(Romo) can't win 1 playoff game just shows he has been exposed already!|`|pTLcvsVfaa	wow, you people are idiots.
NFyQWFoGaa	Your question doesn't make sense.|`|iYX18vg3aa	Cross country runners or long distance runners are skinny but fit|`|MwGXTFymaa	Depends on his natural build and his physical maturity.  Usually CC runners are leaner than say a sprinter.  Sprinters usually have the fast-twitch muscles and are heavier built and stockier than the longer, leaner distance runners.
acaAycEXaa	I'm starting to, but he still has to make up for bringing him in in the first place.|`|fe3cf86ee176021daf6b79ae5ae6df7daa	I cannot respect a professional sports team owner, of any team, as they perpetuate the concept of a few people getting paid so much, and then pay for it by jacking prices on the masses. These people are perpetuating a culture of greed.<br>  <br>  Taking my kid to an NFL game is easily a $200 event. Thats just wrong. Greed is unreal....<br>  <br>  I cannot see why a football player should make more than a surgeon. One entertains me, one saves my life. I think the life-saver has more value to society.<br>  <br>  But to specifically answer your question, I think TO's talents are countered by his inability to be more gracious in the locker room. He makes obscene money. They all do. Players like TO who are consistently obtuse in their behaviors need to go away, and for that I am thankful towards Jerry, if not respectful.<br>  <br>  However, you know somebody will pick him up. Maybe Oakland.|`|xUaZizzaaa	yes, because anyone willing to let go of a great player like that needs to be rewarded. Because you also have to take into consideration that he is a complete and total asshole that doesn't deserve to stay on any team.|`|cSrWQokbaa	NO, he was a douche before they signed TO and he still is just not a full of summer's eve as he was before|`|Tvdr94dqaa	i say he was a total fool because he dropped him for no good reasons it was bullcrap.|`|ULw1777caa	One move like this changes nothing.|`|KR3IvxNwaa	at least he made one good decision.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	No, if nothing else I sympathize with Owens. I hope he looks back on his experience with Dallas and reveals to the public all sorts of happenings that went on inside that locker-room. <br>  <br>  If he gets the opportunity to play with a quarterback who doesn't blow every single game in key situations, who knows to what limit that team could succeed?|`|XaFYUMRSaa	I have zero respect for Jerry Jones and his circus which is the Dallas Cowboys.He's the one that made all the moves to bring guys like TO,Pacman .........etc to Dallas.Jerry Jones has be the biggest Problem in Dallas.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	No not really, but Owens had to go. The guy's a malcontent and along with Pac man was nothing but a huge distraction. The bigger mistake bugged eyed Jones made was not signing Ray Lewis.|`|DWJOMWQ8aa	No, he made a mistake. TO is one of, if not, the best WR playing today.<br>  <br>  Romo will now be exposed for the weak QB that he really is.|`|liHpJvVfaa	They needed to get rid of him a long time ago. He has a horrible attitude and bi*ches about everything. He will prob go to the Raiders because they are the only team that will sign him.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	Ive lost some respect after the past few years , but he did get us three superbowls, So I have give the man some respect.|`|XJv0wTsDaa	No i have no respect for Jerry Jones or anyone associated with the Dallas Cowboys|`|ZeN4IEVPaa	I'll start respecting Jerry Jones when Al Davis wins another SuperBowl.|`|wAiQOP0Laa	Respect?  Jerry Jones?  What?<br>  <br>  How could you put those words in the same sentence and your grammar check not catch it?|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Maybe more Respect Because T.O. has brought down the Team, I'll respect him more If he releases Romo.|`|fxj6aaFUaa	This is a joke question, right?<br>  <br>  <br>  How can you respect a douchebag like that?|`|79uzTFl7aa	No.  JJ is Howard Hughes, verilite

0BRnovJYaa	David Wright|`|br1FB5rraa	You mean people that are still playing?<br>  My favorite player STILL playing is marcus thames or curtis granderson.<br>  My favorite player NOT playing is nolan ryan|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	Dustin Pedroia|`|W4ydOMYjaa	david wright.........|`|OsWyGBAUaa	I'm confused.  Do you mean the best, like the title of your question?  Or do you mean my personal favorite, like the explanation suggests?<br>  <br>  In my opinion the best player is Albert Pujols, which it pains me to admit this because I am a Cubs fan.  But my favorite player has to be Derek Lee.|`|PpS55zARaa	Derek Jeter, or Dustin Pedroia...usually have .300+ batting averages, not big slugger but solid for base hits and putting the ball in play, great defense, both of them and MVP's aLL Star's and Team USA piks.|`|JVUsliRGaa	Chipper Jones,<br>  No better switch hitter in the league or in history for that matter.|`|IkOHh5X8aa	MANNY RAMIREZ MAN!|`|24zz6Gesaa	cc sabathia or mark teixiera|`|A5p9g4tMaa	AROD Babe Ruth|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	I will say the Fernandez guy,|`|SEcM9EDZaa	Albert Pujols. It's fact, not just my opinion.
sVPjp3dUaa	As we witnessed last year with the Rays, finances don't truly show what a team is capable of doing in any given year. While some teams do have absurdly high payrolls, they're not guaranteed anything. On the same token, teams with relatively low payrolls aren't necessarily pushover teams. I do believe the Reds will be a factor sooner or later. I just don't see it in their near future (3-5 years). While the size of the market CAN make a difference for a team's finances, the real difference makers are the hidden talents in their farm systems. Year after year we see a nobody come up and make some sort of impact in the league. More often than not, that nobody is from a small market team. He plays in the Bigs a couple seasons, makes an impact & is ultimately traded to a big market team or is let go via free agency. Yes, it would be nice if every team had a decent chance to be a contender. Unfortunately, the business side of the game makes it too difficult for some teams to be competitive for more than a couple years at a time. If you're a Reds fan, I say keep your head up. Sooner or later things will fall in place for them like they did in the late 80s - early 90s.|`|TWol6a30aa	They need a better front office.  Small-Medium size market teams can still contend. Twins, Brewers, Rays, all did well last year.  Also developing from within in the farm system has proved valuable with successful small market teams.<br>  <br>  Don't give up yet Reds Fan, there is hope.|`|SEcM9EDZaa	Not as long as Baker is the manager...|`|A5p9g4tMaa	no they will always loose|`|rjuqrHK7aa	They can be a factor. They have a good young pitching staff with alot of potential. I doubt by the end of the year that Brandon Phillips will be the best hitter. They have two guys named Jay Bruce and Joey Votto. They will be top level players. If you really want to look at it Votto is better now. Last season Votto had more hits, doubles, HR's, RBI's, and a better average. Volquez won 17 games last season, Harang won 16 games in 2006 and 2007. Arroyo won 15 last season. Cueto has potential to be a top starter. Pitching wins championships. If i remember the Rays didn't spend much money.|`|oOVAbKPmaa	The problem is that with the way baseball is currently structured, small market teams such as Cincinnati end up developing players for the clubs that can afford them a few years down the road when they become top notch players or superstars. In short, no small market team is gonna be able to keep its young stars for long, because such players will continue to defect to the teams with money, such as the Yankees, Red Sox, Dodgers, etc...

HtYGxZcCaa	I would like to make some moves but I dont think it will happen. And James H is correct, free agency isnt usually where the Colts make some moves. Where the Colts improve their team the most often is through the draft and Bill Polian may be the best in the business when it comes to drafting. I would like to see us pick up Derrick Brooks though if we could stay under the cap and get him for only say a 2 yr contract. The Colts had cap problems this year so it was hard to get FA,and even with releasing Marvin there still isnt sufficient cap room to do anything big. DT is an even bigger concern than LB and im almost certain the 1st Rd pick will be used on a DT. Brackett was injured during the playoffs the LB group wasnt as strong, but now I dont think its too bad. Brackett and Keiaho are good LBs and Clint Session is starting to emerge(hopefully he can play well this year)|`|yxaOg0QDaa	yeah I'm a big time colts fan and they just continue to frustrate me<br>  <br>  they build a team good enough to make the playoffs every single season, but then they get eliminated first or second round, and its because of their approach to defense<br>  <br>  they want to draft young players and let them grow, but we don't have time to grow, we need vets who been there done that, we need guys who can actually make tackles<br>  <br>  I'm still pissed over the fact they let haynesworth slip away, I know they were tight financially but damn so were the skins but they pulled it off anyway, and haynesworth even vocalized his appreciation for the colts and said he wouldn't mind playing there<br>  <br>  we need DTs, I don't know too many guys out there better than him, but either way, we need to stop the run, that is the 1 and only thing stopping us from getting 1 or 2 more rings in the next 3-4 years|`|XCwjsfz2aa	I think so, it would be nice to see them grab a defensive player or two. As you should know, the Colts dont make a whole lot of big free agent signings. They'd rather work "in house" deals without going outside the walls, do things in the draft etc. Alot like the Steelers.|`|daRDQE9maa	Peterson, Brooks, june, They all can still blow some people up and Indy doesn't have the strongest linebacking corp... but i dk we'll see GO BUCS!|`|Oa7lX9m9aa	For you to be the number one Colts fans, you sure don't know how the Colts work. We RARELY go after overrated free agents.|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	I could be wrong, but I don't think they have the room under the salary cap to really be able to pursue any free agents.  The little money they do have available has to be there in April so they can sign their draft picks.
HtYGxZcCaa	you have to wait until the ncaa tournament bracket comes out<br>  <br>  but the 5 times with the best chances of winning the title to me are:<br>  <br>  North Carolina<br>  Pittsburgh<br>  Connecticutt<br>  Louisville<br>  Oklahoma|`|P6fT0LBiaa	You have to wait to the teams of the NCAA tournament are announced.  I would say Syracuse or Texas.
iK4pMtmzaa	I heard there's 18 divas on the roster plus Gail Kim so that leaves 6 spots. However I'm going to take Tiffany off because she doesn't wrestle.<br>  <br>  1. Trish Stratus<br>  2. Lita <br>  3. Stacy Keibler<br>  4. Molly Holly<br>  5. Ashley (on her blog she said she's returning)<br>  6. Sunny or Chyna<br>  7. Ivory or Dawn Marie or Torrie|`|VBfhoqS3aa	Trish, Lita and Chyna. Nobody probably remembers Bull Nakano, so that would be a waste of time, and as the other guy said Sable is bregnant with Brocks baby.|`|s4bpeNhDaa	Stacy and Christy come to mind. <br>  I'd also like to see Molly again.<br>  <br>  Chyna, Ivory, Jacqueline, Victoria maybe?<br>  <br>  Who knows, should be good if it happens.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	I didn't know they were going to do that.<br>  <br>  Of course Trish and Lita<br>  Maybe China<br>  Sable (highly unlikely seeing as she's pregnant with Brock Lesnar's baby, lol)|`|2yVRuX0yaa	I agree with Brian i heard Trish will come back at Wrestlemania.|`|09YK9Zboaa	its going to be Trish.. thats pretty much it|`|0xp9Oobnaa	Trish is the only one who's coming back to WM25 if the plans goes well.
