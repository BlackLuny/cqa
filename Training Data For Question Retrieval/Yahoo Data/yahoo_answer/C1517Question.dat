20090308091307AA8ImjO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Will humans develop technology beyond what we can currently conceive,would it be of any use to perfect man?	During the time of Babylonian empire and the tower of Ba'bel.   Jehovah confused the language and scattered the people.      (Gen 11:5)  And Jehovah proceeded to go down to see the city and the tower that the sons of men had built. 6?After that Jehovah said: “Look! They are one people and there is one language for them all, and this is what they start to do. Why, now there is nothing that they may have in mind to do that will be unattainable for them.      That said "nothing...unattainable.  When man is once again of one language and perfect, what will he do as regard high tech?      As perfect humans will we find the simplicity of life a wiser course then one of continued advancement of the most complex devices.      I suspect the indoor bathroom and electric lights are here to stay.   As well as communications be it RF or something not yet conceived of will alwas be with us.      I speak of the plasma reactors.  The molecular transport, you know "beam me up Scotty".        Just curious.

(Matt. 27:46) if jesus were God, then couldn't this be read "Myself, Myself, why hast thou forsaken Jesus was prayed the Lord's prayer (Luck 11:2-4), was he praying to himself? When in the garden of Gethsemane he prayed, "O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless, not as i will, but as thou wilt." (Matt. 26:36). Was Jesus praying to himself? Jesus, of his own admission and his own action, acknowledged, worshiped, and prayed to another being as God is clear proof that jesus himself is not God.

We go to a very small school and in between classes my brother and his best friend were taking betas and putting 2 into the same container and everyone would watch. I understand how cruel it is and and stuff, but now they have detention every day until the end of the year. Do you think that this is excessive?

Matthew 19:14      Since small children imitate when they trust their parents. Perhaps Jesus meant for us to follow him with childlike trust.

20090308093516AAp4VCu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are angels radioactive?	Angels are not of this earth, so they must live in outer-space.  The Milky Way is extremely plagued with gamma radiation.  The radiance of angels may actually be gamma radiation.  The angels must be immune to these lethal doses of gamma radiation, but humans are not.        God, the creator of the universe, must have the highest level of gamma radiation since He spends his eternal time streaming through radiation filled pulsars, black holes, and super novas.  God is so radioactive that if humans come near God they will instantly die of gamma radiation induced cancer.  For this reason no human has ever seen God and lived.      When the sons of god (fallen angels) impregnated the earth women with their radioactive sperm in the book of genesis, the gamma radiation caused the birth of giant mutant children with monstrous faces and super human strength.  These mutant children were called Nephilim.       The fallen angels turned God's beautiful creation into an evil Marvel Comics alternate reality.  The earth must have been filled with super heroes and super villains resembling the Incredible Hulk, Fantastic Four, Spiderman, and the X-Men. God destroyed the earth by flood to eradicate the Nephilim mutant population.  Only Noah and his family survived the mutant holocaust. Is this accurate?

OKay, so my boyfriend and I, are going to prom on april 17th. BUT our school won't let us go as a couple. We also are not allowed to walk in the Grand March together.       MY idea was to just buy a single ticket, but since i am a junior, i have to be asked by a senior to go to prom (Which SUCKS because my boyfriend is a senior). Also, my brilliant idea to walk in the Grand March, was to find two lesbians who are in the same situation and walk with them. lol.   Anyways. I would love for you guys to give me your honest answers on this topic.

20090308095048AASzsZy	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If you get divorced and remarry, and you claim to be saved, does Jesus keep on forgiving you?	"Whoso putteth away his wife and marrieth another commiteth adultery."   Luke 16:18      Apparently it's the sin that keeps on sinning.      If you claim to be saved, as many church folks do, and you are in another marriage, does Jesus keep on forgiving you?  Assuming you really do claim to be saved?      Would you say that's rather generous of him?

20090308094640AAgApzV	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Would community polygynandry (one can have sex with anyone) be a solution for sexual morality?	Would community polygynandry be a solution for sexual morality?      I come out of a Puritan tradition that said essentially "sex is bad". That was a bit primitive. But indeed even now I see the great damage done to the lives of young people,especially by that blind wild sexual urge. It is very harmful to the status of women, but indeed it also ruins the character of men.       But then i wondered, what is the origin of sexual puritanism? And I realized perhaps it was not rational. Sex lust does a lot of damage to social relations. A culture of pleasure in the end leads to more pain. But there is nothing inherently wrong with the physical act of sex, except STDS, and perhaps pain to females.      So the solution seems to be, to allow people to enjoy the physical pleasures of sex, without the negative cultural and social relations that follow. Community polygynandry in which any man can have sex with any woman, and any woman could have sex with any man seems to be the solution. So it could be a voluntary organization in which men and women would have the opportunity to have sexual relations with men and women, equal and more attractive than them, but in turn have to copulate with those less attractive.       If sex was de-mystified in this way, as simply a way to enjoy physcial stimulation, without the ugly cultural side effects, I think marginal utility could be maximized.      What are your thoughts and objections?

Yes I admit that a small percentage of fat people cant help it because they were born like it or have an illness but the majority (like 95%) of fatties are just fat because of their own greed, gluttony and selfishness. This is criminal to keep stuffing you face with pizzas and burgers while other people are starving to death. All fat people should go to prison untill they loose weight and change their eating habits. What do you think? It would save money for the NHS and general resources.

But basically I noticed she gave me the "vertical scan" two times , I saw her on two separate occasions that day.   During study time after saying "you're welcome" as to force her to say Thank you for helping her.  She thanked me and she had stroked my arm, I asked what I could get in return, and in the WEIRDEST tone she said "what do you want?".        All the while.. the same day she had cheated on her long term gf with a guy because she was suffocated by current girlfriend.         Just, whoa. Thoughts?

20090308103428AAEj97T	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Any of you athiests believe in "The Secret"?	I was wondering if you believe in anything that could be described as "weird" or "paranormal" or "supernatural".      If you believe in things like "the secret", describe how it isn't spiritual or religious for you, or how it works.      I am of the opinion that "the secret" is religious because you are asking "the forces of the universe" to accomplish something for you. That's a personification of a non-living object IMO. So I would be interested to know how an athiest defends practicing this while still claiming to be an athiest.

20090306161603AAFiCME	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	ReligiousTolerance.org has an interesting report on Gay Teen Suicides. It seem to prove that.....?	.......Conservative Religion is responsible for the majority of gay teen suicides.      What can be done about this? The following is an excerpt from the Religious Tolerance website:   ______________________________________...      "Cause of suicides according to religious liberals, therapists, etc:   On the other hand, most gays, lesbians, therapists, religious liberals and mental health professionals believe that many of the individuals who commit suicide are motivated to end their life by their hatred of themselves as gays and lesbians.      This, in turn, is derived from the hatred of homosexuals and homosexuality which permeates society and which they internalized during their childhood.      Considering that:      Homophobia is largely based on religious beliefs which among Christians are derived from about 6 quotations from the Bible.   Three out of four Americans identify themselves as Christians   Most Christian churches have actively taught hatred of homosexuality for decades.      Conservative Christian churches are currently leading the fight to:   Prevent gays and lesbians from enjoying rights and protections equal to the general population, prohibit marriages for loving, committed same-sex couples,      Oppose adoption by gay or lesbian adults, and   Keep accurate information on sexual orientation out of the public schools.      we estimate that CHRISTIAN CHURCHES are responsible for at least 40% of the homophobia in the United States.      Another way of looking at this is to imagine what would happen to the acceptance of homosexuality in North American culture if all religious institutions were as active in promoting equal rights and acceptance of gays and lesbians as the Unitarian Universalist Association and United Church of Christ have been for many years. After a few decades, children would no longer grow up hating homosexuals. After puberty, when a minority of children became aware of their own homosexual or bisexual orientation, they would accept it as a normal expression of human sexuality. They would be far less liable to commit suicide to avoid a life of same-sex orientation.      Assuming that external and internal homophobia is a main cause of suicide, we believe that churches can be conservatively assigned indirect responsibility for about 496 youth gay/lesbian suicides per year. This rate is greater than the witch genocide rate in Western Europe during the witch burning times in the late Middle Ages and Rennaisance.      If we include suicides by homosexuals over the age of 24,   youth suicides which are reported as accidents,   the additional deaths from STDs due to lack of sex-education in the schools (which is often kept out by influence by religious groups and the federal government)   then the churches' responsibility is much greater.      Gay positive religious groups:   Not all denominations share an equal portion of this responsibility. Some mainline, liberal, and progressive Christian groups are accepting homosexuality as an alternative, normal and natural sexual expression for a minority of adults. But to our knowledge, the United Church of Christ in the U.S. and United Church of Canada in Canada are the only large Christian denominations that:      accept gays and lesbians (both celibate and involved in committed relationships) as church members   accept gays and lesbians for ordination   promote a homosexual-positive educational program in their churches   advocate in their behalf against discrimination and persecution, and   provide a religious ritual recognizing their unions or marriages.   These teachings are found also among:      Non-Christian groups, including congregations associated with the Unitarian Universalist Association in the U.S. and the Canadian Unitarian Council in Canada.   Congregations of the United Methodist Church who have joined the Reconciling Ministries Network, It is: "a national grassroots organization that exists to enable full participation of people of all sexual orientations and gender identities in the life of the United Methodist Church, both in policy and practice." 2   Other mainline and liberal Christian denominations who identify themselves as welcoming congregations. More information   A course by Multifaith Works called "Challenging Myself, Deepening My Faith: A curriculum challenging faith-based homophobia." This is "... a collection of four lesson plans addressing attitudes toward homosexuality in different faith communities. The lesson plans are written from the Christian, Jewish, and Buddhist traditions, as well as a session appropriate for any faith tradition. The curriculum is accompanied by a four-segment video focusing on personal stories. Cost is $20 for the curriculum and video." 3   Until all denominations change their policies to match that of the United Churches, they will remain part of the problem and not part of the solution and will be the cause of teen suicides in the future"      Full Report Can Be Read here:    http://www.religioustolerance.or

20090306224629AAIEkJK	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	How many hours do you ACTUALLY WORK during the day?	We all work 40 hours some more.  But how many hours are you actually focused and doing actual work.        Now I'm aware that blue collar jobs do actually require you to ACTUALLY work just about 40 hours a week, I used to work in construction.  But any white collar workers who say they work the whole time are full of s**t.  Remember, any 20 minutes you take to talk to a coworker is not work.  Any time you surf the web and check your email is not work.  Birthday parties for co-workers, talking on the phone with your wife and auto-mechanic, etc.  Meetings and BSing on the phone with clients are questionable in my eyes, but they count I suppose.      So, what is it?  No place to be honest like Yahoo Answers.      For my last job, I'd say I put in a good 6 hours of work for every 8 hours I was there.  It was pretty demanding.  Some days I'd get close to 7 hours of focused work for every 8, but I'd slack a little more when things were slower. The job before that was something like 4-5.  Easy job...

Gay marriage is legal in parts of the world, in others it isn't.      So, it seems a fair question to ask. How threatened is your marriage by gay marriage?       Does a South-African married gay couple only ruin the sanctity of marriage in South-Africa? Or also in Burundi?      Does a Dutch gay couple ruin only the sanctity of Dutch marriages, or also in Italy?      Does a Massachusetts married lesbian couple ruin only the local straight marriages, or also those in California?       Just wondering what is the correct distance between you and a gay married couple, in order to keep your own marriage safe?

I am wondering though if the human mind could find some way to force Pharoah to bend to your will, a way that does not include the wholesale murder of new born babies?      Did the bible god have options? Or is killing babies the go to solution that any Supreme Being would use?      Could you use your god powers to force Pharoah to bend to your will without killing babies? Or would you, as an all powerful, super intelligent god, just go right to baby slaughter knowing that killing babies always assures the outcome will be in your favor?

20090306224649AAVPAlW	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is it a sin for Christians to get a tattoo?	According to the Bible,it is. "Do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves. I am the LORD." - Leviticus 19:28   However, others have said that it would depend on the motive. e.g. "for beauty"- some girls have their eyes tattooed on the eyelids(eyeliner).   I see so many tattooed Christian artists and think maybe they got them before being saved, but aren't they supposed to remove it?   What's your opinion?

I am not gay or wishing a sex change but I have always been amazed by the process especially how a man can be changed into a woman (and new parts added and taken away).  I have seen some good photos of women that looked very impressive.  However, I was curious about a couple things.  Can a man who has had a sex change and became a woman have real orgasms?  Does the hormones change the voice or is it something that has to be practiced?  And finally what about the scent of a woman?  A vagina for example has a very distinctive smell.  Does a sex changed woman have the real smell of a woman (from the hormones also) or is this something that does not occur.

OK my neighbor did a favor for a friend of a friend and toke in some pups that she couldnt keep.The girl told her that they were 8wks and fully weanedShe told my neighbor that she was going to get these pups a good home.My neighbor then found out that she is trying to sell these dogs for $500.00 and has had no responses.To top it of she found out that the pups just made 6wks and not 8wks like they first told her.The girl also wnts to come over an have her dog give milk to the pups but she did not sign up for this.She doesnt need anymore dogs in the house or have someone sit around until the pups are ready to eat.She is frustrated and the puops are always crying.Plus she knows now that they are really 6wks and people have aked her if they are ready for there new homes(meaning are they 8wks)an she doesnt wantto lie because what if somthing happens to the pups and the vet needs to know the right age.She doesnt want the responsibility anymore and doesnt want to have to have to put everything on hold until this chick sells her 3mutts for $500.00.So morally what is the right thing to do give them back since the girl lied an i now bringing the pups mother over like this is some kind of daycare for dogs or should she keep them.BTW they cry at night nd during the day and she thinks it might be because they sill need there mother

If God allows these things to happen "because he must give the molester free will to sin" , why must the child be involved ?        If God wants so badly to judge people on whether they will choose to do the sin or not, why involve the kid ? To me, this seems selfish on Gods' part.

20090306165640AAUU65W	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	View points of anti-gay marriage supporters...?	First off, this isn't a rant or a question meant to change you're opinion about gay marriage. I just want to hear you're opinion.      Christians: Why do you think that gays can't get married? I know it's a sin, but you don't try to stop people from cheating or getting divorces (i don't know if divorce is a sin or not). Why do you care if they sin or not? It is their lives and if they want to sin they can, right?      Atheists: Are any of you against gay marriage? Why? I don't see why you would be if you don't believe in God(s).      And one more question for anyone, whether they're against or for gay marriage: Do you think gays should be able to adopt children? Why or why not?      Thanks so much! You can e-mail me if you want to discuss this further. I'd love to hear you're opinions!

Because apparently the FDA does not allow blood donations from gay men.   W.T.F!?      Honestly, if we are to start battling for rights, it should be to get rid of that stupid ban.

20090306215224AAsXDeA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	When many constantly question your orientation just because you're single, and it's REALLY ticking you off?	Should you just make up a story about having a boyfriend?      I'm a fourth year college student. I have been asked so many times why I don't I have a boyfriend by this point in my life, and honestly it's because I could never find a guy who is interested in me as a person and not me as another body. I have many goals (but--ironically--many of these goals are to learn more skills concerning crafts, cooking, gardening, etc.) and pursue them actively.      Other people don't ask initially, but they treat you differently after they know you're single. Then, later on, you learn that they asked someone else if you're homosexual. I know I'm not the most feminine-looking person out there: I enjoy things such as hiking and many times I'm miles away from dresses and perfume. And, just generally, I don't have a petite figure. But it's really irritating to be judged based on appearance.      So, I'm waiting for the right guy, I've heard there are some out there. But, I really am getting close to screaming at the next person who asks me if I'm lesbian just because I'm single. Just because I've waited for so long.      Any thoughts?

20090306163514AAmUB5m	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question for the evolutionists out there...?	I learned about this in my biology class in the very beginning of the year.         In the 19th century, the famous Louis Pasteur proved an ancien traditional belief formed by Aristotle: spontaneous generation. This, as you all probably know, is the obsolete belief that living things can come from non-living things. People never dared disrepute this belief, and used the fact that maggots would come from meat as "evidence".        Of course, Pasteur disproved this by preforming a simple experiment of covering some meat and leaving other meat uncovered. He noticed that flies visited the uncovered meat but were unable to reach the covered meat. Maggots came from the meat he covered, but never came from the covered meat. He realized that maggots were the spawn of flies...living things had bred living things within non-living things, and spontaneous generation was not possible.        May I ask then, why does it seem that evolution teaches this? Before you start to protest, allow me to point out that this is how it sounded when I was taught: we came from some ape-cross human beings, which came from a long line of assorted animals which, if you date back far enough, came from a primordial soup. That came from water on the rocks. Both of these are elements, not living things. Technically...to me...it sounds like spontaneous generation. The whole evolution theory does...something came from nothing. Please explain?       PS: Some people may think that, as a Christian, I am being hypocritical. I don't believe living things came from non-living things. Genesis 1:1 says, "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." I know a lot of y'all probably don't believe in the Bible...but I am told that it is a Living Word and will never return void.

20090306234012AAtdKXz	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why is sex so important to Teenagers?	I'm 19 years old and don't really have sex a lot. Since I broke up with my ex around June-July of 2008 I've had sex twice, but I never go out looking for it. I go to clubs and parties with my friends to drink and have fun, but I don't actively look to pick up chicks. Most of my friends, and the other guys that are just around always seem like they're on the hunt for girls and then brag about having sex with them or doing something with them afterwards. The two times i've had sex since breaking up with my ex GF no one even knows about, but it seems other guys do anything with anyone and they must tell everybody.       So, is it strange that I'm not as interested in sex as other guys my age? I'm curious as to why. I watch porn sometimes and I like girls, I just don't go out looking for sexual encounters all of the time. If it comes it comes. Any time that wasn't with a girlfriend has happened because it just felt right and fell into place, not because I forced it.       So what do you think about this? Why is it so important?

20090307002706AAaZFtZ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians Do you ever regret asking questions on here when it comes to questioning Christians?	I do. Cause in all honesty. Asking questions to a Christian on here is like a police officer questioning a criminal for a crime he commits. You will get a answer, but the answer you will get will never be the answer dealing with the question at hand.    It's like a man who robs a store, get caught with the items, but will go through a whole hour trying to defend himself with excuses.    If he sees that the cops aren't going for it, then he cries that the police are harassing him. The very same thing that Christians do on here.    So I have come to learn, never questions Christians on here, because they will have excuses for the wrong they do and will use scripture to back up their wrong doing.    I am so happy that I have enough material to finally complete my next book.

20090307002213AA5jg7M	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Want to know what god is ?	I have figure out what god is.    Year after year I was trying to and now I know.    God is simply something more.    No matter what I think he may be he will always be something more then    whatever I thought he was. He is bigger then our universe.    If God is everything, that would make the Devil nothing. Since good    and evil are opposites it would only make scene that the opposite of    everything is nothing. A perfect example of this would be matter and    dark matter both of them are in this universe but they do not    interact with each other.       This next part might be a little bit to much for you to understand   just like dark matter and normal matter this is evil on good   but just like dark matter and normal matter they do not interact with each other.      Nothing in this world, that we will ever know is evil or bad    every thing is good. Ask yourself why would the lord create some thing that was evil? ANSWER is he wouldn't. The lord wouldn't create evil.    Why would some thing so holy make evil? he would not make anything evil. If this is to hard to you to process then I'll say it once more their is no evil, just like emotions are real, they are just chemicals in your brain.   It makes no sense to create a world with evil. Every thing is good we just can't understand how it can be ... if god loves everyone that means he even loved Hitler even he did thing to make other people sad.   I've been told if everything is good, killing some is good then also.   i'm not saying you should go kill but, we kill chicken, we kill dogs we kill birds ..... how do we explain that? because they aren't human? we kill gods creations just because they aren't like us, how foolish. killing is WRONG killing anything is wrong.    i give up ~ i'm lost myself

Not very much around 5-8%.  So, it came time to collect and he sent one of his employees around to collect and they beat him up.  They wanted to renegotiate the terms.  He was never around anyway.    So, he sent another employee, this one they threw rocks at and hit him on the head repeatedly and sent him away bloody.    He sent about 4 more employees and it just got worse and finally he said, well, these are good people when I knew them, and I knew them for a long time, I am not certain whats going on, but I'll send my son and see if he can get anything done.     So, he did he sent his son.  But they thought that since the son was coming, his Dad died, and they knew that if the son was dead the court would give them ownership of the land. So, they killed the son, thew his body over the fence to rot, did not even bury it.       What did the dad do??????

20090307001426AAqoDy7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Antiochus Epiphanes, Sacrifices a pig to Jupiter on the Alter of the Jewish temple, Why didn't God react?	Antiochus Epiphanes represents the type of 'the abomination of desolation' foretold by the prophet Daniel, on the altar of the Lord in the inner court of the Temple. Antiochus Epiphanes serves as a foreshadowing of the Anti-christ to come in the days ahead. Many Old Testament types pointing to end time fulfillment's are first in the natural and second in the spiritual, so we may see the spiritual temple defiled in these days. Prophecies concerning Antichrist would be 8th chapter of Daniel: first Greece and Alexander, then four notables. Daniel "And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences shall stand up. etc.." May also be prefigured in Dan 11.6 as the king of the north.    [08, 23, 319, 304, Daniel, 392]

Then I woke up with my T.V. on, and my cable off so it was a dark light...   So my dog was sleeping on my sweater on the ground, and I look at it for a second, and I saw a little girls face with the 1950's hairdo...       I'm freaked out because their was another spirit in my old house from watching "A haunting". After I watched like 3-4 episodes on my computer, it got very very dense and tight, and I was seeing stuff.... But I never saw the little girl with the weird hair-do... Could anyone help me? Should I get the cross with Jesus on it and put it in my room? Thanks.

I need some advice on something that has been killing me now for almost two years, all the time. I think that my western brothers could be relate or talk about this issue, but any help is appreciated. I must warn that my story is long and contains some sexual content. Thanks for everyone's help and your patience with me.   Hey Everyone. Sorry that this is so long, but it’s been bothering me and I have to get it off my chest, and see what people’s opinions are so hopefully I can put my mind to rest. Here is my story as I best remember it and as truthfully as possible. About a year and a half ago I got drunk at a bar with a friend of mine. Sometime while he was up and away or after he left, I was sitting on a patio with a woman about my age (21) and I wanted to make a move on her, so I kissed her ( it must have lasted for a few seconds, and I tried sort of using the tongue, but I am still rather timid and pulled away after a bit so it’s not like I really have her a chance to respond to it) . She didn’t say anything or ask me to stop, she seemed fine with it, maybe a bit surprised at most. Later I put my hand down her pant and touched her bottom , though as we were both sitting down so I don’t think I got down too far ( not that I was trying to, I’m not sure what I was thinking other than I was an idiot.)   She never asked me to stop or seemed disrupted ( after all, if someone just leans over, kisses you full on with tongue and all, you’d say something right?, and then I’m sure if she had a problem with my touching she’d of said something.) anyways, when my friend came back and went to leave, some of her friends ( she was with others- she was not alone) said I should leave with him ( because he was asking me to walk home with him) but I wanted to stick around to talk with this woman. At the time I thought that they wanted me to leave with him just to be nice to the poor lad ( after all, I abandoned the poor guy for a 20 minute walk home - and yes, I have apologized profusely for my behaviour to him as well that night.) Later on in the night, I was walking, about to leave when a girl starting talking to me and said something along the lines of ‘hey, weren’t you the one who tried to stick your tongue down my friend’s throat?’ I was offended by her way of saying the question,   More than half a year ago, I remembered this event and it started bothering me. Did this woman feel violated by my actions? Did I sexually assault someone? I became very harsh on myself and forgot to remember that it was a stupid thing I had done- but I didn’t force her to, and I would have stopped had she asked me to. I have been obsessive about the event and I am now taking meds for my depression. Though the meds have helped and my quality of life is returning, the questions still bother me - Is this woman alright? What if she had never kissed someone before and I violated that for her? Will I ever accept myself and be able to forgive myself and move on? I would never do something to hurt or violate another person, and I feel like I’ll never be able to fully forgive myself.   At the height of my depression I did not want to live and considered myself the worst, most vile scum on the planet, but I am starting to come around to realize I made an honest mistake and didn’t mean any harm

First off i would like to say thank you to you all! You are amazing people and i admire you like you wouldn't believe!   Secondly, i have a question for you. I was wondering, what your opinion is on, what branch is the best? I know this sounds like a dumb or selfish question but please hear me out. I have an amazing boyfriend who started serving last year and I'm thinking of signing up for the National Guard. I wouldn't be signing up for a year so i have some time to think about it. But I was just wondering what branch was the most likely to keep me in the country and help me pay for college. Don't get me wrong! I'm not arrogant enough to think that there's a branch that will never send me over seas but I'm asking because when me and him get married we don't want to be shipped off at different times or, when we have kids, at the same time! We don't want to never see each other! Basically, i started thinking about enlisting when i was sure i wanted to go to college but didn't know how i was going to pay for it. That's when i thought of joining the Guard. Because they will pay for my tuition and ill stay in state for the most part. But I'm not planning on retiring from the military. I want to go to school for Midwife Nursing, and/or becoming a Psychologist/Therapist that works with the soldiers. So a job with one of the branches that has something to do with one of those degrees would be most helpful but if not that's ok too.   Sorry this is so long but i really need all the help i can get!   Thanks so much for any input you have!!   And again, thanks for what you do!

I miss not growing with him on a spiritual level.  He doesnt go to church nor will he read the bible.   However he does believe in God and we have some wonderful discussions about God.  The past many months I have been feeling our relationship is dilluted and somewhat unequally yoked in our spiritual walk. What are your thoughts?
20090307010442AAw50P6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Faith IN or faith OF?	I've been recently made aware that the Bible says "Faith OF Christ" is what saves us.  That means Christ has to believe in us, not vice-versa.  Kewl; all us non-believers are off the hook!

Well that cd is to installed to your computer so the printer can work. Without that cd being installed into your computer, the printer will not work. Well Brad wanted to borrow Delisa's color printer into his computer but Brad said that he didnt need the cd because the printer will work without it. But Delisa tried to explain about her color printer and the cd. But Brad kept on telling her; "You dont know what you're talking about, I dont need no cd to connect the printer to my computer". Well Brad tried for hours to connect the printer into his computer. But it kept saying You will need to install the cd. Then later Brad was thinking to himself that she was right and he also replied to her "Delisa you were right, I did needed the cd". Now do you think Brad is doubting Delisa?

I honestly don't believe, but I just want to see what some people have found on the subject.

Me and my Asian friends mostly like to hang out with each other and we laugh and play games and talk about our lives, then the Black people and Mexicans at my school are always very loud and fun. I know some of them and they are always smiling and they are very friendly and fun to be around, but the white people are very blah. They only like to talk about what they have and they seem like they don't like anyone else. Some of the white guys are friends with the black and Mexican people too, but most don't like them.       It just seems like in general, when white people say Mexicans and Black people are loud, its because white people are just boring. Has anyone else noticed this?? And not just the ones I know, everywhere I go white people always seem to be trying to pretend they are perfect and they end up just being boring. I think white people in general should loosen up, why are they SO stiff?

20090307001342AAqGDwN	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Gay and starting highschool?	I'm gay and have yet to come out to anyone (still working on it) and I'm starting highschool next year. I'm wondering if it would be a good idea to say I'm gay right off the bat or not. I don't mean running through the halls screaming "Woo I'm gay" but if I was ever asked out by a girl or was ever asked in suspicion I would openly admit I was gay. I figure with every passing year everyone gets just a little bit more mature and by highschool everyone is more focused on getting their life's started and planning for collage to really care. I mainly want to do this so that I can finally have a real relationship. I think my current school is to immature to deal with it. Some students have admitted their gay and its only been used against them. I just feel it's to late in the year to do it so why not start in highschool?

If you're trully interested in considering it, please email me. There is far too much written material to the process for including it here. I can explain it better with an email.   I'm quite excited about maybe meeting someone who shares a common interest, and who would consider attempting to manifest a switch with me.   Is there anyone out there who has enough interest to actually hit me up? Like I said before if your will to know and experience this is strong enough, and you're consciously advanced on a spiritual note- the possibilities are absolutely boundless. IM or email me.   Namaste and Blessed Be.

Even if the bully hasn't killed--if they have been bullied in the passed even or have some "mental condition" I can not give them any sympathy.  I've tried to see where they come from and I can't. I've been bullied in the passed but have never turned to bullying. Maybe that's why I have little respect for bullies.      Also--for people who murder like in school shootings or any other murder. I can not be sympathetic towards them. They disgust me. I don't care if they have a "mental condition" or whatever, they are disgusting to me and recieve no sympathy. I can't do it. Why should someone such as Eric Harris or Dylan Kleybold receive sympathy? Their parents should because something tragic happened to them, but not the children. I was watching a video showing shootings from 1997-2008 and every time I saw the killers, I wanted to scream a bad word at them, but I just thought it instead.          Do you give sympathy to bullies?   Do you give sympathy to murders [school shootings]?   Do you give sympathy to people who murder [in general]?   Do you think they have "mental conditions?"       Explain your reasons.

(41:22)       And that thought of yours which you thought about your Lord, has brought you to destruction, and you have become (this Day) of those utterly lost! (41:23)       Then, if they bear the torment patiently, then the Fire is the home for them, and if they seek to please Allah, yet they are not of those who will ever be allowed to please Allah. (41:24)       And We have assigned them (devils) intimate companions (in this world), who have made fair-seeming to them, what was before them (evil deeds which they were doing in the present worldly life and disbelief in the Reckoning and the Resurrection) and what was behind them (denial of the matters in the coming life of the Hereafter as regards punishment or reward). And the Word (i.e. the torment) is justified against them as it was justified against those who were among the previous generations of jinn and men that had passed away before them. Indeed they (all) were the losers. (41:25)       And those who disbelieve say: "Listen not to this Qur'an, and make noise in the midst of its (recitation) that you may overcome." (41:26)       But surely, We shall cause those who disbelieve to taste a severe torment, and certainly, We shall requite them the worst of what they used to do. (41:27)       That is the recompense of the enemies of Allah: the Fire. Therein will be for them the eternal home, a (deserving) recompense for that they used to deny Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.). (41:28)       And those who disbelieve will say: "Our Lord! Show us those among jinn and men who led us astray, that we may crush them under our feet so that they become the lowest." (41:29)       Verily, those who say: "Our Lord is Allah (Alone)," and then they stand firm, on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): "Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised! (41:30)       "We have been your friends in the life of this world and are (so) in the Hereafter. Therein you shall have (all) that your inner-selves desire, and therein you shall have (all) for which you ask. (41:31)       "An entertainment from (Allah), the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." (41:32)       And who is better in speech than he who [says: "My Lord is Allah (believes in His Oneness)," and then stands firm (acts upon His Order), and] invites (men) to Allah's (Islamic Monotheism), and does righteous deeds, and says: "I am one of the Muslims."

20090227111154AATc41h	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	In Muslim culture... What is the origin of the strict privacy for women.?	I am learning more about Muslim culture specifically in Saudi Arabia and I was wondering what the origin of the strict privacy issues for women are. Women have to cover their entire body and hair, only showing their eyes. In addition, I understand that even at their homes when guests come over, they need to be screened off from the guests and can only speak through a screen.      Can Muslim related men see extended female family members? Such as brother's wife? extended cousins? etc. or can only the children and husband see a woman's hair, arms, etc.      Just out of curiosity... Is this why in Arabic culture, people tend to refer to very good family friends as relatives (uncle) as a sign of respect? or convenience so they can be invited into the home without having the wife to leave the room?      I know there are a lot of questions, but I am really trying to get a general understanding of the culture.      Thanks in advance!

20070613162902AAKVwdH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you ever wonder why these things happen?	Okay, so I've heard many times that our God is evil and that He doesn't exist because somethinf bad happens and it seems like He didn't do anything to prevent it. Well..   1. Sometimes God let's things happen as punishment for disobedience.   2. God gave us the free will to do whatever we want in our life. He gave us free will. He created us so that we would choose to love Him. I mean, He could have created us all with our hearts loving Him already, but who wants a robotic answer..? I love my boyfriend because he chooses to love me.. I love my friends because they choose to love me for me.    I don't know, I'm just saying that God gave us a free will to love Him and you can either do that or not but He'll still be there. You just need to step outside your belief a little and at least look into the true God.

20070519230319AAjhnBC	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	What are the societal motivations against gays?	I have always wondered why some people, and society in general, hold hostile views against homosexuals.   Apart from Religious dogmas, why are many people against gays and gay marriage? Is it because it violates cultural tradition? Is it simply a homophobia? If so, where does it come from?    Would a compromise, for example allowing civil union, still bring about the same problems?   Finally, why does there appear to be more leniency and indulgence for female lesbians in popular culture?
