Goku is fighting the monster Hildegarn and must use his ultimate move - the Ryu Ken, or Dragon Fist. In order to perform this attack, Goku uses his fist to apply a large horizontal force F(t) (with time history shown to the left) for t1=0.62 s to the motionless Hildegarn (who weighs 6400 lb). The speed of Hildegarn's mass center is 48 ft/sec immediately after contact with the fist is broken. (Assume Hildegarn is a rigid body and does not rotate, since the Ryu Ken is applied directly to the center of mass for maximum damage.)      Find the peak magnitude F0 of the force of Goku's fist.       Also, the function is f(t)=F0sin(5*pi*t)      Thanks in advance!!

20090219214659AAHjC7p	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	How is the statisticians Law of Large Numbers not a case of the Gambler's Fallacy?	Gambler's Fallacy is the mistaken belief that future events can be "gambled on" (as though they were sure things)... based on trend.        One type of Gamblers fallacy asserts that consistency will continue as a "fateful" event... and another type of the same fallacy individuals assert an inevitable change, an inconsistency, as future events will balance out the historic events (as though the universe has a memory and that all events will "even-out" according to probability laws)      These are regarded as fallacies in reasoning by logicians and rhetoricians.      But in studying statistics I have come across the Law of Large Numbers... that statisticians use to "predict" future outcomes and "expected values" based on probability laws and past events... asserting that a distribution curve, given enough elements in the set, should conform to the proper shape.      I find this to be the exact same reasoning error.

20090219215717AAYQ8Gi	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Why does this strange pattern emerge?	Just for a change here's a question that is not just someone trying to get you to do their homework  ;-)      I was messing around with a calculator (yes, I know, I SHOULD get a life), and discovered something quite strange.  Okay, maybe not that strange, but worthy of some thought anyway...      If you divide 100 / 81 (or 10^2 / 9^2) you get...   1.2345679...     That is the digits from one to 7 (and then a 9, but that can be explained).      If you divide 100^2 / 99^2 you get (spaces added for clarity)...   1.02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20  21...   In this case the numbers 01 to 97 (with leading zeros), and then an overflow breaks the pattern again.      If you divide 1000^2 / 999^2 you get...   1.002 003 004 005 006 007 008 009 ... 997   In this case the numbers 001 to 997 (with leading zeros), and then an overflow breaks the pattern again.      And so on.      Basically the pattern (10^i)^2 / (10^i - 1)^2, will give you a decimal number consisting of sequential integers, zero-padded to i places.      Kinda cool I think (because I AM a geek), but can you explain why?  Or more to the point, can you provide the mathematical proof.

Often when moving or standing still I will see white things, I call them 'water droplets' fall from ceiling to floor in my peripheral vision.      Sometimes they are so big, I will flinch or duck because I do believe that there is some water going to hit me on the face or shoulder, but alas there never is.      Is this anything, or simply a problem with my vision? I have good vision and this has been happening for quite some time.

In the xy-plane, point R (2,3) and point S (5,6) are two vertices of triangle RST. If the sum of the slopes of the sides of the triangle is 1, which of the following angles could be a right angle?   I. R   II. S   III. T   A. None   B. I only   C. III only   D. I and II only   E. I, II, and III      I think it's C, because the slope of RS is already 1, but if point T was at (5,3), this would form a right triangle with the hypotenuse having the slope of one and the other two legs would have a slope of undefined and 0.  Disregarding the undefined, this would add up to 1.  However, my book says the answer is none.  Am I right or am I right on this one?

20090219213125AAXUy8Y	Science & Mathematics;Biology	What's your reaction to this science article?	For decades, forensic scientists have made claims about fingerprints, ballistics, handwriting, bite marks, shoe prints and blood splatters that lack empirical grounding and have never been verified by science. This was just one conclusion of a two-year study by the National Academy of Sciences, which called for a wholesale overhaul of the crime lab system. The academy, the preeminent science adviser to the federal government, found a system in disarray, with labs that are underfunded and beholden to law enforcement, lacking independent oversight and without consistent standards. The report concludes that the deficiencies pose "a continuing and serious threat to the quality and credibility of forensic science practice." With the notable exception of DNA evidence, the report says, many forensic methods have not consistently and reliably connected crime scene evidence to a specific individual or source. For example, the frequent claims that fingerprint analysis had a zero error rate are "not scientifically plausible," the report says.

20090219220624AA1uM60	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Paranormal Phenomena	Does this mean I'm psychic or something? detailed experiences...sorry its a little long!!?	When I was younger and lived with my mom and dad I would see a girl in our house and we would talk all the time my mom thought it was an imaginary friend but I really was talking to someone I was like 6 or 7 before I stopped seeing her. But then in that same house I was a latch key kid...my mom would hide a key somewhere and I would come home a few hours before she got home from work after school sometimes the cabinets in that house would swing open and swing back a forth I thought it was cool actually. Also sometimes I would come in and the TV would already be in the channel I wanted to watch which was weird cause my mom always had the news on in the mornings and had turned the TV before she left....after we moved out of that house when I was like 11 I talked to my mom about all the stuff that happened there and she pulled out a newspaper clipping from before they bought the house and the daughter of the older owners was killed on her bike in front of the house she said she didnt wanna tall me about it when we lived there cause she didn't want it to scare me.       When I was 7 after my Grandfather passed away I was at his house with my mom and grandma and my grandma asked me to go to their room and get her comb and I saw an angel coming up from the ceiling when I first walked in it was sitting on the bed and I guess I scared it cause it shot up and went away it was beautiful though.   More recently...         I've lived in this house with my mom and step dad for about 12 years now and it's an older house it was built back in the 30's but we've done a lot to it and stuff and it's nice....       But...when we first moved in I had a really big stero and the volume would go up and down constantly when I had it on. I thought there was a short in the wiring so my mom took it and had it looked at and it was fine and the volume continued to go up and down. I recently got rid of it and got a ihome for my ipod but the person who I gave it to has no problems with the volume.       A few years ago I was in my room and it was night time I was asleep and something woke me up it felt like something was crawling in my bed...I woke up to find my outside cat inside on my bed and we never let her in but I just let her lay down beside me and thought nothing of it an went back to sleep...the next morning my step dad told me that my cat had been hit by a car and was killed...when I explained to them that she slept in my room that night they thought I was crazy.       I'm now 21 and it's been a while since anything has happened except for a few weeks ago I noticed something. I have a Teddy bear in my room that sits on top of my desk that was given to me by my aunt who recently passed away with colon cancer and everyday when I come home the bear is turned different then the day before sometimes it's facing the wall sometimes its sideways or facing straight.       I'm not really sure why this stuff happens to me...I seem to be prone to seeing things happen I guess???       I also have dreams for example my moms friend had just got married last year and about 4 months after they were married I had a dream that Jennifer was pregnant and I asked my mom if she was and my mom said not that she knew of and then 2 weeks later my mom had lunch with Jennifer and she told her that she was 6 weeks pregnant...my mom and I both thought that was odd.          I also had a dream that my friends bf was going to purpose to her and she called me a week later and said he purposed...that freaked me out a little...         a few weeks ago I had a test in my psych 201 class and I didn't get a chance to study because my mom had to be taken to the hospital the night before cuz she had a gull bladder attack and had to have it removed. When i took the test I read the questions carefully and went with my instinct on how to answer them and when we got the results back I made a 89%. The test was on neurons and all of the parts of the brain (in my opinion the hardest part of psych) I thought for sure I would fail especially since I didn't study...I don't think I would have done that good with studying...      I've also been having very bad reoccurring vivid dreams about something horrible happening in the middle east but I can't really make out what it is exactly.          I'm just trying to figure out what this all means if anyone can tell me that would be wonderful!! Thanks =)

Each of the 8 sides has a length of 12 cm.      I get almost everything about this problem, but then I get stuck here:   A= 1/2 (6/tan22.5[degrees])(96)   What am I supposed to do with the tan22.5 degrees? I don't even know what the h+ll it is!

A bit iffy I know, but it was that or leave it to fend for itself amidst the traffic. Anyway, it was VERY fat, and we were wondering if that means it was full of spawn. Could anyone enlighten us?

20090219191953AAn1icJ	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Chemical Equilibrium Question?	The equilibrium constant, K, for the following reaction is 2.35E-2 at 517 K:         PCl5(g)  PCl3(g) + Cl2(g)   An equilibrium mixture of the three gases in a 19.6 L container at 517 K contains 0.299 M PCl5,   8.38E-2 M PCl3 and 8.38E-2 M Cl2. What will be the concentrations of the three gases once equilibrium has been reestablished, if the equilibrium mixture is compressed at constant temperature to a volume of 10.4 L?          I'm getting stuck when it comes to deriving the quadratic equation.  My understanding is: Using the formula [PCl3][Cl2]/[PCl5] I found the formula to be (0.158-X)(0.158-X)/(0.564) = 2.35 x 10-2. Can anyone help me rearrange the equation to be ax2+bx+c?  It's been a while since an algebra class.      Thanks in advance

That is way more then enough time for the weaker species(apes) to die out. So if evolutionism is real how come the apes haven't died out? This means that evolutionism is all a lie. They claim we evolved from apes, but humans and apes coexisting completely obliterates the idea of evolutionism.

20090219210245AAsJTA6	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Algebra one question? PLEASE HELP?	Uncle Al was walking down the street one day, minding his own business, when he ran into his old math teacher (it wasn't me, I'm not old!!!). They started talking about the good ol' days... The subject of math class came up. His teacher asked, thinking Uncle Al would have a unique answer, what number he always said when she asked him to pick a number. She expected him to say, "Just the first number that popped into my head!" But he didn't. (Bobo might have.) He remembered her story about how people used to take numbers seriously. In fact, good numbers were even more scarce than they are today. Some of the best numbers were given names: pi, triangular numbers, perfect squares, the Fibonacci numbers, etc. One of the best numbers invented, 47, was invented by a paid numerologist.      Today, a numerologist could get rich if she came up with a really good number. The most famous numerologist of ancient times was named Archibald Medes. His good friends called him Archi. Archi was paid big bucks for creating special numbers.      One day, he was offered a million chocolate chip cookies if he could create a ten digit number which met these conditions: the first digit must tell how many zeros there are in the entire numeral, the second digit tells how many ones there are in the numeral, the third digit should tell how many twos there are in the numeral, etc. Unfortunately, Archi died of frustration because he could never find the right number. Uncle Al, feeling a craving for chocolate chip cookies (still), thought he could give it a try. He started to get frustrated, so he called on his trusty smart-people at (insert school name here) for help!         Can you show me the steps of how you solved it. i tried solving this but i can't find the right soloution.   thank you.:]
