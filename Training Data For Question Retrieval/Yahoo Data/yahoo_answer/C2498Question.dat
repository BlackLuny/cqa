20090226192914AAjvcHC	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Two Questions of Ethics and Morality?	I have two question that need to be answered, these questions may seem silly, but, they actually have a point.   These questions are about morality and the ethics of people, and have cause quite a debate amongst my peers and classmates. Not only am I forced to do a survey about each of these questions for school, I am also curious to see what other people would say, so, here are the questions.      1.  Would you let a robot vote?  The robot would be able to think like a human, have emotions, make decisions, and function in society as a real person.   They couldn't be hacked or corrupted, and no virus could sway their decisions.  So, would you let a robot vote?      2.  If you owned a business, would you hire zombies as cheap manual labor.  This isn't about "Oh they could eat me."  If they wouldn't eat you, would you hire them?  Take into consideration reactions from coworkers and employees, and actually feeding them, but also that it is cheap, and you wouldn't have to pay them.  So, would you hire zombies as cheap manual labor, or would you deem it unethical?      Thank you.

It's not about anyone, I'm only 13 =P   never had a boyfriend or anything, this is just the result of reading too many romance novels XD      The universe in crashing down,   the lies have left a permanent frown.   The blazing fire so high in the sky,   It makes me with that you would die.      The world is against me,   my heart just feels empty.   Sometimes I sulk, sometimes I cry,   sometimes I run, sometimes I fly.      I know the sun shines as I sleep with the moon   The moon with leave and the sun rises soon.   I want to run in the safety of the night,   hopping tomorrow everything is alright.      But it's much too late for apologies,   sometimes I think you act like zombies.   Mindless, stupid, dumb *** creatures,   All I asked for was one or two answers.      Do you love me as much as I love you,   do you care enough, are you my dream come true?

20090226194446AAfPGzS	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	Why do so many kids ask questions in the photography category, but then never choose a Best Answer?	It seems like it's always a teenage girl, with a screen name like "xx00" (fake 'straight edge' emo kids usually)  and they ask questions like "How do I take a PERFECT model shot in the mirror" or "how do u take professional pics?"      So several people might give good answers, explaining that you have to have good lighting and good composition, and that taking a picture in front of a bathroom mirror with the flash on is the absolutely WORST way to take a picture of yourself.      Or sometimes, they might even ask an interesting question like "how do you get a picture with light trails."  And so people give good answers, explaining that you have to do a long exposure, and you need a camera with manual shutter speed and aperture controls.      But, of course, the asker never choses a Best Answer.  And all their questions go to voters.  Has anyone else noticed that it always tends to be certain kind of askers that do this?  Why?  Is it because they don't like the answers that they get?  Is it because the answers have "too many words"?  Do they even bother to read any of the answers?  Or do you think maybe it's because they don't know how to go back to their questions to read the answers?      Seriously, I'm wondering.  Why do so many people (usually teenagers) ask questions in the Photography category, but then they never bother to read the answers or choose a Best Answer?      It's getting to the point that I'm starting to look at their Q&A, and see if they ever choose an answer.  If all their questions go to voters, then I'm not going to bother anymore.  I don't care if my answer gets chosen, but why should anyone bother to waste time answering a question and trying to help them, if they're never going to read the answers?      I know I'm probably asking for trouble with this question.  But I'm just wondering if anyone else might have an explanation.  Why do you think so many kids ask questions here, but then never bother to read the answers, and never chose a Best Answer?      That's my question.  (Well, before I get reported and this question gets deleted, anyway.)

His scent! so sweet. Inhaling it until it pulsed through my    body and with my blood,awakened all my sleeping senses.    I came out of   my dream and realised i was still standing infront of him about to take    the plundge and kiss the lips that locked away that breath of sensual pleasure.   It was then just before i could examine the rest of this creature that he took hold of   me,i felt his hand gently tug the hair at the back of my neck and then a force    so powerful i had no control over it. This was not just the force of him   pulling me forwards locking me head to toe against his body.   It was my heart, it burned like it was engulfed in a shell of flames.   Fingers gripped tightly on my shirt and he relled me in with one last tug.   I felt the hairs surrounding my innocance and desire stand on end    and then a sound so orgasmic i nearly gave way completely. He had let out    another glimpse of what he might taste like and again his breath was mesmirizing.   It was then i moved in closer eager to have what awaited me. Moving his hand   from around my back he took my chin and gently pinched the tip. My head    naturally lifted up and it was then he leaned down into me. At first i felt his warm lips   purse against mine, then gently but with just the right amount of passion   he began to dominate me. Our rythme was in his control. My pulse began to   flutterer and with this i felt my legs shake and my back arch. His tongue gave    the edge of my lips a slight tickle and it was then i really tasted what i had craved.   This man could read my mind i didnt know how but he knew what a wanted.   When suddenly he let go, but why? I didnt come round straight away as i was still   stuck under his spell. My head was spinning and everything was a blur. Until i saw him!

Please be nice, but I want feedback.      Passenger      Everyone always says I have a choice.   A choice to cry   A choice to laugh   A choice to love      But never the choice to die.      To die would mean to stop existing;   To perish.      Everyone tells me that’s a bad thing;   To stop existing.      I don’t agree.   I want freedom.   I crave it.      And if I have to die,   that’s my choice, too.      But when the day came for me to die   I wished I could live.   It was my choice to die,   But not to die this way.      Not in the passengers seat of a totalled car.      So, please tell me your thoughts. I'm only 14 though so I'm not experienced or anything. Should I change the title or have different word choice? Anything will help people!

Im passionate about the arts. im like terribly shy and self conscious (sp??) about the way i look and sing, but im always put on the spot by my bff to sing at all the parties we go to because the always have singing contests. it's not a very pleasant feeling to be dragged by the wrist with "claws" digging into your skin and resisting with all your might because you DO NOT want to be the center of attention at all!! My friend is a WAY better dancer than me.. so i don't enter that contest too. and they defiantly dont have a drawing contest so i cant show off my talent in that genre either.. i want to be more out going by putting myself out there, but im to shy to. any advice for a girl with big dreams??

There stood the kid from seventh grade   Who swiped my lunch money twice.   Next to him was my old neighbor   Who never said anything nice.       Herb, who I always thought   Was rotting away in hell,   Was sitting pretty on cloud nine,   Looking incredibly well.       I nudged Jesus, 'What's the deal?   I would love to hear Your take.   How'd all these sinners get up here?   God must've made a mistake.       'And why's everyone so quiet,   So somber - give me a clue.'   'Hush, child,' He said, 'they're all in shock.

I've got vibrato which developed naturally (whether I'm doing it right though...) and she's trying to teach me how to control and use it.       She told me that lots of people tend to "bump" the notes. And to keep my airflow going, just move my fingers, and do vibrato for every note, not just certain ones.       What does "bump" the note mean though?      And also, what actually is vibrato? I'm sort of using my stomach muscles. But not really... It's hard to explain. Anyway, isn't vibrato with flute to do with the airflow somehow?

20090225123522AAivQL1	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Its still rough but...?	she watches with each passing day,   they live their lives as she dissapears,   from hers,      Wavering like the flame of a candle,   soon to be blown out by the wind,      She tells a story without words,    her skin is her bulletin board,   each scar possesing a story unique to,   itself,      tarnished silver, fruit speckled with brusies,   she is not worth much at all,      the mirror bares the truth,   there is no beauty, only beast,      depression has built a home inside,   of her, eating away at every thread still   connected to the outside world,      her body, soul, carved out,   empty, like a pumpkin on halloween,   the face carved bleak and expressionless,      ( from here on im thinking about taking out)      She watches from  a window,   a family  gathered around a large wooden table,      it begins to rain,   her hair matted, raindrops, like tears,   begin to stream down her face,      she looks in, eyes locking with yours,   tension, walk to the window, close the curtain         anyway to improve it? its still rough and hasnt really gotten a lot of TLC yet.

20090226210621AAlgsOT	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Opinions on my new poem?	Every minute away from you   Feels like a blade   And it's cutting me through and through   My existence of being begins to fade      I've gone away, left without a trace    All I've left behind is a name without a face   'Cause I'll never feel your love of which I chase      It's a feeling, that's a fate worse than death   And with my last breath      I'll shout to the heavens: "I LOVE YOU"
20090225123221AAIVUtL	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Can you find the metaphors in this poem?	The Daffodils       I wandered lonely as a cloud    That floats on high o'er vales and hills,    When all at once I saw a crowd,    A host, of golden daffodils;    Beside the lake, beneath the trees,    Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.       Continuous as the stars that shine    And twinkle on the Milky Way,    They stretched in never-ending line    Along the margin of a bay:    Ten thousand saw I at a glance,    Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.       The waves beside them danced, but they    Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:    A Poet could not but be gay,    In such a jocund company:    I gazed--and gazed--but little thought    What wealth the show to me had brought:       For oft, when on my couch I lie    In vacant or in pensive mood,    They flash upon that inward eye    Which is the bliss of solitude;    And then my heart with pleasure fills,    And dances with the daffodils.       William Wordswo
20090225123613AAJFcbH	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	How do you see this? God is dog ****, god is a flower, god is hate, god is Love, God is murder, god is life?	God is the Holy, and Unholy, God is perfection and imperfection. God is Me, and God is you. God is separate, yet God is one. God is everything conceived within our thinking and everything that exists outside of our thinking.       Interested to see your views. Bless you all!

20090226205039AAmDQ6x	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Another poem. What do you think?	I really liked your constructive criticism so here is my new poem!         You can't always be sure about life   You can never know when it will start or even end   The cry of a newborn baby; The tears of losing a loved one   There are many things in life that we cannot change   Perhaps since we cannot change them, why sorrow?   Life is to short to waste tears for little things in life   We all spill a few tears every now and again   But what do tears give us? Happiness? Joy?   At the end of the day, we will have gained nothing   Nothing but more pain      What do you guys think? Remember I am only 13. Please state your honest opinion. Also, please try to be nice, I am just starting out in poetry so I am not that good yet.
20090225123339AAxesYk	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What are your thoughts on my poem?	We live and we learn,   We crash and we burn,   We work through the tears and progress,   But we always end up in the same old mess,   All we do is run away,   If not we just suffer day through day,   Everything happenes for a reason,   But logic seems out of season,   So work with what you got,   Even if it dosn't seem like alot,   Just lay back and enjoy life while you can,   Cause if you dont then your just foot prints washed away in the sand.

20090225123109AALHjfh	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Ok this started as a rap but now i guess its more like a poem. Tell me what you think! Thanks?	It's Over, It's Done      I never thought I would hear myself say this,   especially not after the first time we kissed.   But I realize that after all the days of me cryin and deeply denyin, I'm glad we're through, now I'm over you.      Don't get wrong, what we had was great,   felt a connection that I thought was too true to be fake, but then,   it's like we took a turn for the worst.   Like winter, you turned cold,   the relationship grew old...   So I think we both know that it's needless to say,   we didn't mean for it to end this way.      I tried to make it last but that stressed me out,   felt the pain like blood flowin through my veins.   How could I feel the same? What you saw was a girl that placed no blame and excepted what you gave.   But on the inside I was trapped,   like I was in a room with no doors.   Tried hard to get my point across but you made me feel nonexistant,   and soon we drifted until we were no more.      Then I tried to get us back but that made everything worse,   turned a blessing into a curse.   Like a mirror reflects faces, I looked in and saw the place where the pain you caused was etched in my soul.   Like an old abandoned building our foundation began to crumble,   the walls began to rumble and what we built so high came crashing down.   As I was crushed below th remains you dusted yourself off unfased,   and ready to move on.   So now as I open this new chapter in my life I must close yours with a bittersweet feeling,   held you high, like you were my number one.   But our Goodlife?.....It's over, it's done...

I know that's very general, but I'm not sure how else to put it.  I sometimes wonder if I'm the only real human out there, and everyone else I come into contact with is an "actor"deceiving me into believing that "this" is life in order to distract me from the "actual."  Idk, perhaps I'm just rambling...I don't expect any real answers but I thought I'd give it a try.

What are you in the shadow of trees   Engaged up there with the light and breeze?      Less than the coral-root you know   That is content with the daylight low,   And has no leaves at all of its own;   Whose spotted flowers hang meanly down.      You grasp the bark by a rugged pleat,   And look up small from the forest's feet.   The only leaf it drops goes wide,   Your name not written on either side.      You linger your little hour and are gone,   And still the wood sweep leafily on,   Not even missing the coral-root flower   You took as a trophy of the hour.

20090226194017AA51TEA	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	Pros- would this make sense?	I'm looking to start marketing my skills, and will need to upgrade my gear a bit. Of course you have to have a back-up body. But I'm thinking that I would use a full-frame for most work like headshots, macro, low-light events, etc, and have an APS based body for my back up, but use it for travel work, animals, or anything requiring a long focal length, thus utilizing the crop factor to save money (and weight/bulk) on huge telephoto lenses. My thinking is that resolution detail of cityscapes, landmarks, etc at tele lengths is not quite as critical as say, a portrait.      Thoughts?

I'm in 8th grade and was told to write a poem and I wanted to know peoples opinions about it...         I long for warm days,    and for summer rains.   The laughter and joy that summer brings,   for new beginnings and happy endings.   The sent of flowers as I walk by,   and watching the birds as they fly.   I dream of picnics by the sea,   with my sisters and me.   Leafs again growing on the trees,   and again hearing the bees.   Warm breezes to sweep through my hair,   leaving me without a care.   For the exciting atmosphere,   giving off by all children near.   Drinking cold lemonade as we sit by the pool,   then jumping in so we can get cool.   I long for warm days,    and for summer rains.
20090226213708AAhArmS	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Could anyone tell me the theme of this poem?	Conscientious Objector            I shall die, but   that is all that I shall do for Death.   I hear him leading his horse out of the stall;   I hear the clatter on the barn-floor.   He is in haste; he has business in Cuba,   business in the Balkans, many calls to make this morning.   But I will not hold the bridle   while he clinches the girth.   And he may mount by himself:   I will not give him a leg up.      Though he flick my shoulders with his whip,   I will not tell him which way the fox ran.   With his hoof on my breast, I will not tell him where   the black boy hides in the swamp.   I shall die, but that is all that I shall do for Death;   I am not on his pay-roll.      I will not tell him the whereabout of my friends   nor of my enemies either.   Though he promise me much,   I will not map him the route to any man's door.   Am I a spy in the land of the living,   that I should deliver men to Death?   Brother, the password and the plans of our city   are safe with me; never through me Shall you be overcome.       And if anyone could tell me about the rhyme scheme, repetition, alliteration, rhythm, diction, ans symbolism in this poem it would be much appreciated.

I finish reading a book called The Solitarie Mystery written by Sophie's World author. It was an amazing book talking about life and philosophy. A father and a 12-year-old son travel from Norway to Southern Europe to find their mother that ran away short after the boy has grown a bit. On their way, they met a dwarf who gave the boy a magnifying glass. Then, they kept traveling across Mount Elbrus in Northern Italy. They saw their mother on a Greek beauty magazine and ..........      Anyone who likes philosophy should read it. It is a mysterious book and is my favourite philosophy book. There is a bit fantasy included. In my opinion, it is way better than Sophie's World and very original.

I realize most will never become best seller nor insanely rich, but is it very difficult to get published as a novelist?  Is it true most have another day job just to make ends meet?      This is a review I found from CareerCritique      "Hours/Week: 10   Education level: Masters in English   Percent of time on travel: 0   Years of Experience: 5   Job Security (Rate 1 to 10): 1   Comments: Very few authors earn a living entirely from writing. I am an english teacher full time, author part time. Being a writer is very very rewarding; being an author trying to make a buck from publishing is not. Editors and agents receive so many manuscripts many will simply be ignored. The others will have to be "commercialized", which kind of puts a damper on creative impulses. Im fed up with publishers; I think I may start my own website which holds my new stories.....maybe make a buck or two through google ads.      To younger folk, I wish you the best!

20090226221148AATu3ox	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Is there anything left to say about anything?	For a while now, I feel like there is nothing to say.  I have no comment on anything that comes up in conversation, it all seems meaningless.  Everyone talking about things, stuff, mishaps, daily life, he said, she said, personal beliefs.  Everyone wants to have sex, make money, find a mate, it seems so primitive, yet we all masquerade as being this highly advances species with technology to prove it.  If we as a species have gone to the moon, and mapped out space, why cant we advance mentally?  nothing makes sense and i feel isolated.  I don't think im better than anyone else, i just don't feel like competing anymore. my opinion is just one in a million and is only relevant to my own understanding .  I understand the importance of communication as a social animal. ive felt this way ever since i was young. why?

20090226214142AAKJouv	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Need help with a title!!!!!! for a book i wrote!!!?	Ok i wrote a book last summer. Havn't really decided on the title. Btw if you dont like young adult realistic fiction stop here.      Heres the blurb:   Every little girls fantasy is to be a princess and be whisked away by prince charming. But when your title changes from kid to teen, everything changes. Barbie's place is taken by boys and Prince Charming by rock stars. Cute, awesome, perfect rock stars; the kinds whose faces are posted on every teenage girls wall. This fantasy suddenly becomes a possibility for Lilly Haden when her best friend becomes that guy and her life begins to change. Move over prince charming here comes Ben Johnson.      Heres part of the first chap:   Chapter 1    Dream and Reality                                   I walked across the Red Carpet, my boyfriend’s hand intertwined with mine. He was perfect. After freeing my hand he signed autographs, as fans screamed his name. He smiled and I watched as all those girls wished they were me. The envy on their faces was unmistakable and I enjoyed it. Then my boyfriend walked over to me and whispered ‘I love you’ in my ear. He began singing my favorite song of his ever so lightly. Then when he was just about to kiss me, I woke up to knocking on my door.   “Always right before the good part.” I whispered to myself, right before I said come in   “Breakfast is ready.” My mom said, I nodded.   Ok, that’s not my life and I can only dream that Ben Johnson was my boyfriend. I certainly wasn’t the envy of all the girls around the world that would kill to kiss him but I would consider myself at the top of that list. I have reason to be. He was gorgeous and nice and an awesome friend. Trust me, I know. He has been my best friend since well, forever. I have been working, wishing, and praying that maybe he would wake up one day and want me like I want him. When I look my breath catches and I can’t breathe. I know I probably should be grateful just to know him but when I guess love can’t be satisfied.     It’s not like I just fell for him when he became famous, no, I’ve always felt this way about him. He was always that guy could get any girl he wanted and what hurt the most is he never wanted me. I was just the one he would talk to about his girlfriends, never the girlfriend. It wasn’t fair because I envied those girls so much, they had everything I had to live without. They didn’t know how lucky they were. To be his would always be my dream.               I got up and headed down stairs for breakfast with as always him on my mind.                ~               I sat birched up against the back of my bed. Then a call came in on my phone. It was him.   “Hello,” I said.   “Hey, Lilly.” He said. The sound of Ben’s voice caused my heart to jump.   “What’s up?”   “Um… I don’t have a girlfriend anymore.” Ben has, or had, a girlfriend named Sky. She was a dumb TV star. I loved hearing that but I knew he didn’t.   “Sorry.”    “Yah, well you want to meet up. Phil’s in ten minutes?”   “Sure, can’t wait.” I hid all of the emotion in my voice.               I don’t get to hang out with Ben as much anymore, yes his carrier had just started but his songs were already top of the charts. It was nice that we lived in Anaheim not at all far from the offices in LA. I ran down stairs, jumped in to my brand new Toyota Salora and drove to Phil's Smoothes Shop where Ben and I have been going ever since we were 12. I got out of my car and walked into Phil’s.                Ben wasn’t there, so I ordered our smoothies and sat in our favorite seats. Ben walked in dressed in a disguise, a bad one at that.    “Hey, Lily.” Ben said with large glasses on.   “I’m sorry sir but my friend is going to sit there.” I said with a laugh.    He lifted his sun glasses and said “Yah, yah.”   “So... what happen?” I asked.    “Well… some photographer caught Sky kissing some guy and showed my handler the photos before selling it off to Cover girl or Seventeen.” He said rolling his eyes.   “Oh. Are you sure it was her.” I asked.   “Yah, I’m sure.”   “Have you talked to her yet?”   “Yah. I took her to dinner last night then showed her the pictures. She was definitely surprised.” he said sadly.   “I’m sorry.” I said truly meaning it.   “Yah. So am I but it’s not worth getting all worked up about.” He said looking into my eyes.   “Anyway I’m going to a party tonight, to get my mind off of things, want to come; all of the Hanna Montana cast will be there.” He said smiling because a year ago I told him I was in love with Mitchell Muso.   “Sure.” I said with a smile.    Though Ben and I were meant to be, I’m ok with dating other guys for the time being; totally hot stars are always a plus.   “You know something?” he said.   “What?”   “Well my girlfriends come and go but you and I are forever.” He said as he banged his smoothie glass to mine.    “Your right, when other girls have the best girlfriends; I have you.”   “And I have you.”   “I’m really sorry about what Sky did to you. You deserve better.”   “And so do you! You should be hanging out with you

20090226194325AAKGwxX	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Peter Pan the musical?	so i'm in the production of Peter Pan at my school and the music teacher who is also directing it chooses her favorites, which I personally do not like at all. but tomorrow night is my last night as a lead (there are 2 casts), and i really have to win her over! I play Michael Darling and i'll try to act super cute tomorrow night and emphasize everything. Does anyone have any tips on how to really make the audience love me and make my music teacher think i'm better? also, at the end of the play tonight, when the characters were doing their bows, the other Michael came out and made his teddy bear wave to the audience. My music teacher really liked that and she was smiling a lot, so does anyone know what i can do that can be cuter and funnier with my teddy bear or just with myself?      I need all the advice I can get! Thank you so much!!

20090226213424AAKWjPM	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Help me find the name of a book!?	I need to find the name of a book i read once.      I don't know the names of any really major characters, only that the main characters friends brothers nickname is 'Corny' and that there is a dark water spirit usually appearing as a horse, and its name is Kelpie      The summary is as follows:   A 16 year old girl returns to her grandmothers house, in the city where she used to live, and used to see fairies.   Later on in the book, she is walking home after a get together with some old friends at a merry-go-round, and she meets a man bleeding ( i dont remember his name, but i think he had black armour on, and his real name MIGHT have been Roiben) The man tells her to call the Kelpie (again, i dont remember how) and he rises up out of the water in the shape of a horse. The girl rips her shirt and wraps the mans wounds in the shirt.      .....Memery blank....      Later on she finds out she is a fairy, or a pixie or something like that, and that the man she helped was the one who killed one of her old fairy friends, Grimy... i think... or it might have been spike...      Anyway, she then goes to the Kelpie, and she learns from him how to take her human cloaky thing of and it turns out she's blue.. i think. and cant touch iron. She is also required to be a sacrifice for the evil queen of the bad guys which is where the man she helped lives.      Memory blank....      Then, right at the end, the Kelpie takes her friend and drowns her.   The end.   Help me find the name!

20090226215707AAA7EzO	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of my free verse?	A Friend      When you need someone to depend on,   In times of austerity,   In times where everything’s aberrant.   And for the days of abandonment,   And the days of affliction,   There is a person who thinks about you.   This person with agape arms,    Of which are expectant of tears,   Expectant of all you have to give.   That person is always present.   Remember, you have a companion in them,   And all they can possibly do is be there for you.                  I had to write this for my eighth grade english class, so I thought I would share. Let me know your thoughts and comments.

20090226213944AAGU7qX	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Any ideas on how to sing "high notes" rounder?	I am a freshman vocal performance major. I am a soprano, heading towards lyric coloratura. I have a powerful voice, loud, but still light. I always sang very forward; but now I need to round it out a little bit, so when I go above the staff I'm not suddenly in a different voice.       This is imperative as one of my pieces for juries this semester is Bach's "Huete noch" from the Coffee Cantata, and several times leaps from a C5 to an A5, which doesn't seem so bad; but it's one of the focuses of my studies this semester, so that the high notes don't suddenly shrill out from nowhere.       My voice professor is amazing, and always helps; but I wanted to surprise her by fixing things a little more on my own. I am very driven and a perfectionist, and independent, so any thoughts would be nice, as I don't think this problem will go away just because I'm not singing a certain piece.       I have tried thinking about the sound moving backwards, thinking down instead of up when I have a leap, different random mouth and jaw positions, and simply swallowing the sound (when I became frustrated, not that I would actually sing that way). I don't know if visualization will help. Singing is so personal and "mysterious," if you know what I mean. But I'll take anything! (Including setting up appointments with the other voice professors on campus.)       And since I'm here, any advice on relieving jaw and tongue tension? I don't have much, but I'd like to clear up my bad habits now.

20090226220008AAHDPnm	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is my Story ANY good so far? Please HELP!?	Annie looked around the dense space, the space in which her strict school called the computer lab. She was clutching the note her mother had written to Ms. Kindeeli. The one about her not using the so-called dangerous internet, even for educational purposes. The reason her mother had done this was more likely to be a People headline than a story in Annie’s boring life. Six months ago Annie had been in danger. Her mind just wasn’t in the right place, especially after she was slipped into a certain “Wonderland” with the wrong kind of people. It was like one of those rides in Disneyland were you kept thinking it would be over, but then it keeps going for another five minutes.       Annie was adorable, with bland, yet little girlish features. Her chocolate brown eyes stood out in a crowd like fake gold on Cleopatra’s tomb walls. Her fashion sense reeked of a skater’s, but nobody knew how hard she tried to make it seem that her outfits took longer than curling her hair. Annie’s beautiful hair cascaded over her shoulders in massive curly heaps whenever she turned her head. When she smiled the sun would come up daintily over the clouds, and when she cried it would rain humongous heaps of transparent water. Thus, implying she was thought of as an angel. Annie wasn’t perfect, although the pressure was on for her because she seemed to be perfect.       In the past week her life had been more shocking than a season finale of Degrassi. She felt like nothing was going right or ever would be. She just felt numb. A sick kind of numb, the kind where you felt like there was absolutely nothing left in the world to look forward to.

20090226191502AAYz0Ns	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How does my story sound for a beginning?	I awoke to the sound of graceful humming with a hint of sadness. My eyes were still asleep but my hearing was a hundred percent awake.    “ Madame?” I questioned with my voice still scratchy.    “ Yes, Jessie. I’m just getting my last look around before I set off.” Madame Mc Hailey’s words flooded with sorrow. I had almost forgotten that my most favored maid I’ve ever known was leaving. And this time, she was serious. I finally retrieved my eyesight when I saw Madame Mc Hailey pull up my smooth leather chair from my desk to the side of my bed and sat her slim self on it and stared at me. She kept her distance as if I had some kind of contagious disease. Then she started to smile.    “ I remember the days when I was changing your diapers, and the time when I took you to the doctors for the first time. You put up such a racket!” She paused and gazed at the blue sealing of my room. “ You know, I never thought that I would see you grow from a month old to 16 years.”    “ Yea.” Her words were now starting to make contact with my emotions. “ Why do you have to leave? And why won’t you tell me why?”    “ I’m not supposed to talk about it. But,” she quickly got that last word in just when she saw me open my mouth,” I really wish I could tell you.”    “C’mon, mom!” I quickly realized my mistake and put my hand over my mouth. I knew that Madame Mc Hailey understood what just happened. After all, she couldn’t blame me for not having a mom. She knew that I had always thought of her as one, which is the main reason she didn’t want to leave.   She lifted her hand to catch the first dropping of salty tears. It felt as if she wanted me to get emotional, too. My brother’s voice echoed through the hallway, alerting Madame Mc Hailey that her taxi was here. I slowly rose from my bed and gave Madame Mc Hailey a long, firm hug. “ Be good.” She whispered. Without a warning, she pulled out from me turned around, and quickly left.   Something kept telling me that this was my dad’s plan, that he wanted Madame Mc Hailey out of the house. I paced all about my empty room, wondering and tracing everything that happened to me back to him. I’m not blaming him for all of this because I hate him, but everything that happened in the past was his fault. For example, when he took me out of school, in kindergarten after I started to make friends, that left me crying for months. And when he moved my brother and I across the United States, after we made friends in our neighborhood. His excuse was “ they’re bad people in the world, and the friends you guys were making was one of those people.” Give me a break!   The aroma of bacon hit me while I was in thought and it sent me downstairs to the kitchen, asking for more. I entered the kitchen and saw Randle leaning over the cooking top checking his egg omelet and bacon.    Randle is my older brother, but something about him just freaks me out. He’s always full of hatred and secrets. He hates my guts, hates your guts, and he could care less if the world was going to end. But some how, I always say he’s my big bro, and that’s what they do. And the weirdest thing is that you could never catch him after 9 o’clock. He’s never around at that exact time. At 8:59, you see him walking towards his room and slam the door shut. And then at 9 o’clock P.M. on the dot, you could walk into his room and not find a soul in there.   “You better back up before you burn yourself.” I worried.   “ I don’t care, and mind your business.” he replied in a low, unpleasant voice. But I knew he’d say something like that, so I continued.    “ What’s your problem?” I asked.” Everyday, I get the same harsh talk from you.   “ You want to know my problem?” he breathed.” My life.” He was now chopping red and green peppers for his omelets, which made me real nervous and gave me thoughts about what he, could do with the knife. But instead, he chopped the peppers like a professional chef. His hands swiftly moved in a rhythm-like motion while he diced. I changed the subject.     “How do you do that so well? Your like a pro!” I stared at his now still hands to find that he was staring back at me, blankly.   “Shut up.”         Tell me how it sounds. By the way, I;m only 12.

20090226163519AAJlyeo	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What′s your opinion about this?	What′s your opinion about this?      Yesterday I was reading a text about the quality about Emily Dickinson′s poetry and one paragraph in the text called my attention and I want to share this with you so that you can give me your opinion about this. The paragraph says:      "For Emily Dickinson there were three worlds, and she lived in all of them, making them the substance of everything that she thought and wrote. There was the world of nature, the things and the creatures that she saw, heard, felt about her; there was the "estate", that was the world of friendship; and there was the world of the unseen and the unheard. From her youth she was looked upon as different. She was direct, impulsive, original, amusing, and she said unconventional things which others thought but dared not speak, and said them incomparatively well. The characteristics which made her inscrutable to those who knew her continue to bewilder and surprise, for she lived by paradoxes".      So I have 2 questions:      The first one is: What do you think about this paragraph? I mean what′s your opinion about the "three worlds" where Emily Dickinson lived? Is it true or not?      And the second one is: The third world (where the text says she lived) is the world of the "unseen and unheard". What does it mean?   I have two possibilities: One is that this is the world with things we can′t see or heard, I mean supernatural things (like God, love, hate, hope, etc).   And the other possibility is that this is the world where people "don′t want to see" and "don′t want to hear", I mean people who don′t want realize about determined things, so they did not want to hear other people, etc. I think this because in one part of the paragraph it says "She was direct, impulsive, original, amusing, and she said unconventional things which others thought but dared not speak, and said them incomparatively well". It means that she was so impulsive that she said things that she thought and felt and people thought the same as her too but they did not want to talk about that because you can never say what you really think. So What′s your opinion? Am I right or not?      Thanks a lot for your answers!!!!!
20090226174555AAsO1Ih	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	William Blake's NIGHT?	What is this whole poem about? What are the romantic characteristics from the period of Romanticism in this poem? How about themes?      The sun descending in the west,   The evening star does shine;   The birds are silent in their nest,   And I must seek for mine.   The moon, like a flower,   In heaven's high bower,   With silent delight   Sits and smiles on the night.      Farewell, green fields and happy groves,   Where flocks have took delight.   Where lambs have nibbled, silent moves   The feet of angels bright;   Unseen they pour blessing,   And joy without ceasing,   On each bud and blossom,   And each sleeping bosom.      They look in every thoughtless nest,   Where birds are covered warm;   They visit caves of every beast,   To keep them all from harm.   If they see any weeping   That should have been sleeping,   They pour sleep on their head,   And sit down by their bed.      When wolves and tygers howl for prey,   They pitying stand and weep;   Seeking to drive their thirst away,   And keep them from the sheep.   But if they rush dreadful,   The angels, most heedful,   Receive each mild spirit,   New worlds to inherit.      And there the lion's ruddy eyes   Shall flow with tears of gold,   And pitying the tender cries,   And walking round the fold,   Saying, "Wrath, by his meekness,   And, by his health, sickness   Is driven away   From our immortal day.      "And now beside thee, bleating lamb,   I can lie down and sleep;   Or think on him who bore thy name,   Graze after thee and weep.   For, washed in life's river,   My bright mane for ever   Shall shine like the gold   As I guard o'er the fold."

20081031180839AAz8oKt	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Help me fix this story please?	this is my friends story i fixed it up as best i could but its still not perfect you know....well tell my what i can do please...if theres anything      (Day 1)  I first met him two years ago at a party.   I went with two of my friends but they wound up ditching me earlier to talk to someone else, predictable stuff. He was beyond perfection.  I knew I would never see anyone like him again. His hair was a little dark but blonde, it hung a little in his pale blue eyes, his jaw wasn’t quite squared of yet, he was a little taller then me, his lips were full, but not too big, I watched him open his mouth and noticed his teeth were perfect, straight and the whitest white I had ever seen,  he was slim but not too slim, he looked around fifteen or sixteen, he was perfect.  Why had I not seen him before?    He had been standing by the wall by himself ,occasionally someone would walk by and say something to him but no one stayed long enough for a real conversation.  Of course I had to talk to him.    “Hi, what’s your name?” I crocked on the “your” part  and hoped he wouldn’t notice.  “I’m ummm…“  What was wrong with me I couldn’t even remember my name? “….Charity.”  I looked at him and smiled sheepishly. I knew that once again I had made a complete fool of myself, I always seemed to do that when talking to guys.  I tilted my head down not wanting to meet his gaze and waited for his answer.    “Oh, well that’s a cool name, I’m Cade.” he replied.    I looked up and he was still looking at me,  he looked at me like he was interested in what I had to say, I couldn’t leave now, he was expecting me to say something else.    “Um, so are you from around here?” I asked. I felt my cheeks flash hot red, and my head titled down again.    “No.  I’m from Germany, just moved here two weeks ago.”  I looked up for a brief second and I met his gaze,  then I quickly looked down again.    “Cool.”  I mumbled.  I could feel my cheeks getting warmer by the minute. “So what do you think of it here so far?”    “I think its awesome, I love it.”  as he said this  he smiled.  I knew I wouldn’t be able to talk at all if I kept the conversation going so I ended the conversation with the first thing I could think of,, and fast.    “Well see you later.”  I didn’t wait for an answer, I started walking back to where I came from, he said his next words softly, but I still heard him loud and clear.  And  I could feel his gaze on my back.    “ Bye Charity”    I walked home soon after and when I went to bed all I could think of was him. His eyes, his smile, Even when I was able to sleep my dream was of him, was I going crazy?

I was placed here 8 years ago when I was 4. Now they’re the only family I know. One is Joe; he’s basically a big pile of green goo with one eye.  Another was Rick; he was a spontaneous aquatic something.  And always faithful Grammy Stomper (aka Agatha) the only human of the bunch she made delectable cookies and she had super strength. And then there was me, CY (Cyndi) and that’s all they called me. Nothing’s wrong with me but, then why would I be here? I ponder the fact that I can leave if they don’t see the issue with me, Maybe I can leave, I‘ve been here since the age of 4 but I’m 12 now and never knew my real family.  I haven’t seen the outside world in what seems like ages.   “Aggie (Agatha), do you remember what the outside world looked like?” I enquired “Well the sky was blue and the ground was green, except when it snowed then it was white.” She replied. “Oh just to feel grass under my feet would be great…” she sighed. The slightest recollection of it could be the best.   That night, why all are sleeping, I gather the little that I have and begin my escape to find a better life. Not that this life isn’t enough but it would be nice to find out who those mysterious beings that placed me here were. I softly said goodbye to everyone but someone stopped me.   “What are you doing?” Rick asked. I froze. “Umm I’m leaving…” I trailed off.  He fell back asleep and abruptly awoke “You’re what!?” He yelled. I bit my lip as the others woke up “Thanks a lot, Rick.” I mumbled. The separate containers were heavy metal but not sound proof through the side walls. “Why would you want to leave?”  Aggie asked “Yeah really, and if you were certain, where would you go?” Joe added.   I didn’t think about that part but I was positive that anywhere than this place would do. “New York,” Did I miss something that I said? “That’s right, I’d be better off in the streets than in here.” It made perfect sense “Hold up, CY, if you were actually serious about this, how will you leave? I mean this wall is made of glass titanium. You’d never get out!” Rick had a point. How could I have been so stupid? It was an obvious thought. I hated the fact that I went wrong. I started hitting my head against the glass feeling the stupidity grow inside. I must have hit the glass pretty hard because it had broken me a way out. “I did it.”  I silently cheered and looked outside for a panel or a door that could free everyone else.   I took me a minute or 2 to find a control panel but I managed.  The base was covered in neon buttons, knobs and tuners. Finally a lever that said “MONSTER RELEASE DOORS” '   Sorry ITS SO LONG. what do u think

20090428143038AAIFG9L	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I am writing a story- could you tell me what you think of my characters/names?	Okay, these are my four main characters. They're all sixteen years old, and much of the story centers around this high school choir they're in and a mystery about their director, but anyways:       Geraldine Di Marcie: A "soprano powerhouse" who can be kind of a diva sometimes, but tries to stay humble. She's very stylish, also inquisitive, empathetic, and emotional. She's a bit of a drama queen, but her heart is in the right place. Medium-long brown hair, grey-green eyes, medium-short, very pretty.       Madelyn Schumann: An alto whose greatest talent is playing the piano. Also known as "Maestro". She usually plays accompaniment for the choir. She's very emotionally strong and sometimes sarcastic. She is very witty, practical, and rational. Waist-length wavy dark blonde hair, aqua-blue eyes, medium short.       Christian Johannes: Half of a well-known (in the school) tenor-and-bass duet, as bass. He's very calm and laid back, pays attention to details. He's extremely intelligent and poised, fluent in German, English, Italian, and Danish. Often he's the voice of reason. Dark brown wavy hair, gold-brown eyes, tall and muscular, very tan.       Jojo (Joseph) Dazzle: Tenor half of Christian's duet. He's random and spastic, very excitable and sometimes scatter-brained. He has a lot of creativity and artistic ability. Very flamboyant. Also very vocal about his opinion- which gets him in trouble with teachers. Sassy- but not mean. Very loving (unless you insult him right off the bat) and loyal. Bleached blonde hair, light blue eyes, medium-tall and skinny.

20090225123857AAVqF09	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Writing a novel, requires a bit of reading...?	i have been attempting to write a novel and i want people's opinion on my first 3 chapters. anyone can offer their input and please, im trying to get this published so be as mean as you like (No insults please) and critique the story like you would if it were published and you were a real critic. here are the chapters.       PLEASE DO NOT STOP READING THIS! You have absolutely no idea what is at stake with this so if you want to live to see another day you should listen to what I have to say. I guess I should start where all of this began but that was a while back.   My name is Eddie Bunch but most people just call me Eddie so I guess you can too. It’s tough to remember everything that’s happened because there has been so much, but I’ll try.    CHAPTER 1: THE BEGINNING    Everything started on my birthday. 5:30 in the morning on March 13th 2008, my life turned upside down. It started as the greatest birthday ever, I mean how many 15 year olds get a car for their birthday. I ended up getting a bunch of stuff that I wanted and it was a great day but the day at school was weird.    I went to first hour which was actually kinda normal, granted it was still a weird class but you know nothing out of the ordinary. Then came second hour. My walk down the stairs is where things got odd. I was walking down the stairs and I accidentally tripped and started to tumble down the stairs. I shut my eyes (Hey you would too if you were in my position) and when I opened them I was all the way down the stairs with no injuries at all and my friend was staring at me. "How’d you do that" he asked me with a shocked look on his face.   "No idea" I said with a bewildered look on my own face. Little did I know that was just the beginning. During second hour my classroom is huge and at every desk is a computer. It is sort of dark and always a little cold but I like it in there. Usually it’s quiet and we all get to listen to our own music. I sat down and started to work. I looked down for like two seconds and then smelled something burning. I looked up and my computer was on fire! I quickly got up and ran to the fire extinguisher (which is like right next to my desk) and sprayed it all over the computer. Immediately my teacher jumped up and yelled "WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOING!"         I shrunk back, afraid of the punishment that I knew was going to come but I told my story anyway. "The computer was set on fire, please don’t ask me how because I have no idea" I started to explain as fast as I could. Before I was even done my teacher, at tall man, with hair on the side of his head but not the top, had stopped me from going on.     "No son", he said in a quieter voice "that computer was never on fire and there is no way it could be unless you started it"    "You think that I started that fire?!" I asked him a bit high pitched and with another shocked look on my face.    "I believe that you need to walk down to the principal’s office right this second" he said while writing out a pass for me to go out into the hallways.     "Wow" I thought to myself as I walked solemnly through the tiled hallways towards the office, "I’m really in for it this time"     I finally reached the office door and I grabbed the handle and quickly pulled the door open wanting to get this over with. The office looked neat and trim, just the sort of thing you would expect from an office. It had the doctor’s office smell of god knows what all around and I was told by the secretary to sit down.    CHAPTER 2: FIRE!     I sank down into the chair and felt the odd material I was sitting on. When the principle finally came, I gripped the wood on the chair and looked up at him with an innocent, yet scared look. The principle was a big man and he looked like he could beat a wrestler to a pulp. "In my office" he said with a bit of boredom in his voice that took away from his "tough guy" demeanor.    "Yes sir" I said getting up out of the chair and shuffling into the office.    Apprehension was plain on my face as he closed the door and sat down in his chair. "Now Eddie…" he said in that same voice "you know that what you did was completely against school rules, maybe even the law"    "Yes I know and I’m really sorry but I honestly thought that the computer was on fire and I was just trying to help" I told him in as calm a voice as I could muster while facing expulsion.    "Eddie I’m afraid I am going to have to Expel you from Chippewa Valley High School"      The first thought that went through my head was "Oh My Goodness, I’m going to die".    The second thought was interrupted by the sound of the fire alarm going off. After doing it for years, I was running on instinct and got up out of my chair to walk out of the door.    "Follow Me" the principle said and began to walk out of the door.    We walked all the way out to the class that I was supposed to be in and the principle stood right there and watched as the school began to burn down and the fire trucks pull up. When finally the fire was put o

20090225124022AArWxxd	Arts & Humanities;History	I have a few slavery questions?	A few questions that have been on my mind since I've watched some stuff on television a while ago:      1. What were slavery auctions like? Did they differ?   2. How much did a normal slave cost? (Say, age 20ish, male, something like that.)   3. Around the late 1700s, were there white slaves? (Debt bondage, where they owe debts and pay it off. Or were children sold into slavery like what people do in Egypt - I think that's the country.)   4. Thinking of Plessy v. Ferguson, if someone was only 1/8th black, could they be a slave?   5. What was the housing like for the slaves?   6. Don't laugh, but seriously, I was talking with some people and were any of the slaves used for sex? I'm guessing they were.      A lot of questions, I know, and if you only know the answer to one or two that's fine; I'm curious about everything. Thank you.

I play guitar at family gatherings and stuff... I listen to music like Pink, Green Day, Nickelback, Kelly Clarkson; all the normal teenage stuff, but I love to play slower, more meaningful songs when I play guitar.      Would you rather listen to songs like that (Rock, Pop, Hip-Hop) or would you rather listen to more country songs?      I'm 13, and I'm pretty good at the guitar, I play both types of music, but I play at family gatherings, with my friends and just for fun.        I desperately need a new guitar, but when I choose it's sort of like I'm choosing a type of music to play too.      Soo, I know I rambled on, the question here is which would you rather listen to at family parties and when you're hanging out with friends, acoustic or electric?  Loud party-ish songs or country songs?      I love both, but I like to please people when I play, so I'd like some ideas from other people too(:      **My family says they don't care, but they're supposed to say that!

I decided to, and guess what I found.               I walked into the shop, and looked to the ground.      I saw a book, and picked it up, without a sound.      “ The Illusionary Village ”, read the cover.      And I looked around, and found another.               People must not like this book said I.      And I wondered will I?      So I sat within a comfy chair.      Opened the book I did, and began to read this mysterious write.               A book of secrets it was.      A map of a hidden village.      I will find the village one day, it isn’t hard to do.      Because people didn’t like this book.      Never gave it a chance.               I bought the book.      And Out the door I went.      In search of the hidden village.      My Journey has just begun.

Her smile was like the morning sun   that brought an end to night,   her loved ones gathered in its warmth   and basked in sheer delight.      When clouds would come, they often do,   her tears would dampen their day,   but soon her eyes would twinkle again   like stars of the night show the way.

20090225124049AA5XlLr	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Is it only considered adultery if you have sex?	I've been researching this topic for some time now, and it seems that all sources indicate that it's only considered adultery if you sleep with someone that's not your spouse. Suppose you're interested in dating someone that's seperated from their spouse. What if you only date that person? Is it considered adultery then? If you have a simple, loving relationship (in which you don't have sex), is it still considered adultery? Is the legal and moral definition of adultery, "to have sex with someone that's not your spouse"? What do you think?

20090128113310AAZzGHy	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	How many of you are pro-photographers on the side?	I love photography. I just started my business in June, doing portraits mainly, and have been pretty successful. I've always wanted to be a professional photographer and just have photography as my career, but I'm beginning to see how hard it is to be self-employed. The money with photography is not very good since there is no steady pay-check, and there are no benfits, like insurance, etc.    I also love animals, so I was maybe considering going to school to be something like a veterinary technician. If you have a job but still do photography kind of on the side, can you sort of give me an idea as to what it's like? I'll appreciate any ideas, suggestions, and opinions.

I'll describe whats shes like. She is quite tall, with long black hair, very pale, with a few freakles. she has green eyes, and thin lips. She is not beutifull, but still pretty. She is a very happy person, but suffers from mood swings. She has a lovely smile.       I want the name to be quite original but not like 'Nehaw' or something. Something acceptable, but cool. If it has a interesting history or meaning this would be good. The child would be named around 1990.      tia x
