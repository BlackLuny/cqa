20090305051401AAaYDO9	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Hyundai	Hyundai warranty and transmission?	I have a 2002 hyundai accent. I took it to the dealer because the transmission wasn't shifting properly. Today I called for an update and was told that they are flushing the transmission and doing some other things, but it looks like I will need a new transmission.   1. I should still be covered under the 100,000 powertrain warranty, as I only have 87k, however the guy told me that it MIGHT be covered under warranty. I have a feeling that they are going to give me the run around for this (as far as i know, I have had all scheduled maintenance done). If they try to tell me that its not covered, what should I do?   2. How much would a new transmission cost (non-dealer work)?   3. Any of you ever had a problem getting warranty work done?
20090305051302AA9goGh	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Should I buy my 2007 Grand Prix or trade it in for a VW Jetta S?	So I'm almost to the end of my lease, and I have 2 choices.  I can either buy my 2007 Grand Prix (SE) although has some nice options on it.  Or I can get a brand new Jetta S which is nice but more basic.  Either way it's going to cost almost the same, since a Grand Prix is more expensive and Jettas are cheaper.  I live in the US but I've had bad experience with American cars and given the current economy I am taking a 5 year loan to make sure I can afford the car later on.  I'm going to need whatever car I get to last me for that time!  I know some people might get pissed that I am considering a foreign car but unfortunately for me, I've already lost my good job, and I cannot afford to continue buying something that is not reliable.  SO what is better?  Please help.  I'm clueless when it comes to cars.

20090305060015AAjCfqZ	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Nissan	The 2009 Nissan Sentra SER  or just the base Nissan Sentra  2.0?	Hey, I am seriously considering getting a Nissan Sentra, it is just a matter of getting the SER (not the spec V) or just the base 2.0. I absolutely love the SER's features and the sound of it, the rims, performance, sound system absolutely everything. However I am a engineering student in university and I find it tough to balance 3 days of work and school at the same time. It comes down to $77 a month (after taxes) with $10000 down on a Sentra 2.0 and about $245 a month on the Sentra SER after taxes. I just wanted to know if the stress of having to ensure that I dont loose any shifts to keep up with my car payments is worth for the SER or should I just be content with my first car being brand new. Bare in mind that I dont have a heavy foot anymore and I would want the best fuel economy so im not going to flooring it, although I would like the extra 177HP and the aggressive look to be there. Also I get better rates if I lease the car, however I am 100% im going to buy it out in the end so opposed to spending $225 with 10k down on a financed sentra would it just be smart to lease it for 4 years and just pay $77? So im just pretty much asking if its smarter to lease it and buy it out or just finance, I know that ill pay more over the span of 4 years but I am fine with that.

20090227041142AARB3lS	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Q's about my '92 Chevy S10 Blazer?	Ok so today i went to start up my truck and when turned the key in the ignition all electrical went on as normal and it turned over just fine, but would not start up. I had it started for about a minute then when i shifted it into drive it died and the SES light lit up. Later that day i went out there and started it up no problem and no SES light lit up. Also are there any other reasons that the car would kick/jolt when shifting it into reverse(other then the tranny may be going/slipping). lets see what else... Lately it has been idling very high, and continues to rev even after i take my foot off the gas. One last thing, on occasion I get a fuel smell followed by a very rotten smell after starting it up. Routine maintenance has been kept up on it and majority of these problems have taken place recently but are not consistent. So if anyone can explain any of this or possibly suggest a solution, as to money is pretty tight therefore taking it to a shop is pretty much out of the question. Im looking to sell it so id like to fix some of this before doing so. Thanks.  Truck Info: 1992 chevy s10 blazer 4x4  engine: 4.3

I just got a 1993 Mercury Grand Marquis, 51k miles on it and I think it has a bad transmission. It is automatic and when it changes into 4th gear around 38-43 MPH something grinds really hard as if I ran over the side thing on the highway to wake me up.

20090305081756AAowscx	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	98 Mercury Tracer takes 2-3 turns before it will start, what are somethings it could be?	I've recently replaced 02 sensors, belts and spark plugs, my check engine light stays on all the time.  I've had a mechanic look at it and he says that there isn't a reason that it keeps coming on and can't find anything immediately wrong with it.  It starts really well and with 1 turn over in either really cold weather (32 or below) or really hot weather (90 or above), but it takes 2-3 times to start it when the weather is in between.   I can hear the sound of the starter (I guess) sounding like its sending fluid or gas to the engine.   Once it starts it also seems to sputter a little bit like it wants to die while it's idling.  I don't have a problem once I get driving though.  I'm wondering (guessing) that its my fuel pump?  Any help or educated guess would be helpful.  Thanks in advance.

I got someone to jump it and I went home.      Two days later I went to drive it and it started up and drove 4 miles to a gas station, pulled in and got some gas. The car would not start back up after that. I had someone jump it and I went home, so I'm going home and I'm at a stop sign and it dies again! This time while running....I get home and I refuse to drive it, but it always starts up when I test it now...      The ALT looks fine and the battery is new....

20090305090315AAx3jQr	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Driving Woes in parking lot?	Ok, I got a scenerio and wanted to see what you all think.      Yesterday, I was about to pull into a rather small parking lot that practically has no distance between the entrance and the main Highway. In front of the small grocery store is about 8 parking spaces. However, there is a considerable amt of space for a vehicle to pull out of a parking space while another vehicle can easily and safely pull into the parking lot and park.      So, it's 5 o'clock traffic...and everyone is rushing around trying to get home from work. As I pulled across the highway to enter the parking lot, I did notice a truck backing out of a parking space. Wasn't a problem bc the guy was already out of the parking place and I assumed he was about to proceed forward since his vehicle was heading in a straight line by now to move forward. Instead....by the time I entered the parking lot and was intending on parking in the space at the far end of where he was parked (6 spaces down), I noticed he wasn't going to stop, but continue to drive in reverse all the way across the parking lot! I was already in the parking lane and had no room to totally stop bc if I did then considering the size of the parking lot we are talking about, I would have been right in his way and there we would have been.. both blocked. I couldn't very well back up because I was entering off of a busy hwy where the speed limit is 55 mph so that wasn't an option either. The only option I had left was to try and hurry to get out of his way by parking. His excuse?.. because he wanted to exit the parking lot at the adjacent end rather than pull forward and exit on the other side...so him pulling out of the parking space and using the whole parking lot in reverse which really prevented anyone else trying to enter the parking lot impossible is ok?       I think I did the right thing by being courteous enough to get out of his way by finding the nearest parking spot to get in to prevent him from backing into me as opposed to coming to a screeching halt and blocking him altogether once I realized in a split second that he was going to drive in reverse thru the parking lot.      So, in your honest opinion.. what would you have done?

20090305094650AA02u8V	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	Bike Running/starting problems?	have a 82 suzuki gs 550 with a 4 car setup. The bike runs/accels fine in nuetral and with the clutuch lever pulled. The bike accelerates good excecpt at higher rpm(close to shift point) it boggs and doestn't want to go any faster. It does this in all gears. It has nothing to do with the tranny, i am suspecting fuel/ignition system. The bike accels fine when at a low rpm. Any lead would be great at this point, thanks      New fuel filter and plugs. I just put the carbs on after a through cleaning; jets and all including all ports.       This bogging will not let me get above 50mph!!!         I just bought the bike a while ago. It has ran this way from the beginning.       I recently got a new airfilter for it.        In neutal and when clutch is in I can open the throttle to Wide open without any hestitation. It seems it boggs only under a load at higher rpms. Also It will not start with the enricher, I have to spray carb cleaner in it to start.

20090305092508AApl8sX	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Insurance Check - Made Out to Me and Auto Body Shop?	I read a few answered questions here. I got my car hit and couldn't find the title to my car, so instead of making the check straight to me, they put the auto body shop's name on it as well. It was made out to me and the auto body shop. The bank isn't supposed to take it obviously, but I got mine to deposit it. I'm crossing my fingers and waiting to see what happens. What are the chances I will get the money and the bank will not catch the error? I've heard of this happening before to people with no problem. If worse comes to worse, I can send them a copy of the title and then I get a check made out straight to me. I can then either get my car fixed or choose to pay off my credit card debt with the money. I have a feeling I will get some responses saying it's illegal to not get my car fixed. Actually, it's not; I can do whatever I'd like with the insurance proceeds as long as my car is paid off. (Which it is.) Any bank personnel input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!!  =)

I walked into the Honda dealer and walked out with a brand spanking new 2009 Honda CBR 600RR! I'm excited but I'm only 5 feet 3" tall and weigh 120 lbs. Man! you should have seen me at the dealership. I told the salesman that I can't touch the ground with my feet but he just laughed and showed me how to plant one foot on the ground and other foot on the rear break. He said u don't need to touch the gound with both feet, you only need one. Anyways, this was my first bike and everytime I get on it I ask myself,  is today the day that I 'm gonna die? Luckly, I got 500 miles on it now, I haven't dropped the bike or anything but 0-75 mph in 1.6 sec or so in first gear is freaking me out. I mean  first 300 miles, I eased up on the throttle but now I can't control that urge to open it up. Everytime I do, the front wheel comes off the ground. I get so scared getting on this bike it's not even funny. After the ride I am exhusted from all the tensions. Was I crazy for buying this bike? Does this fear of riding a CBR ever goes away?

The '09 Ram 3500 swb has a GVWR(gross vehicle weight rating) of 10100 and GCWR(gross combination weight rating) of 24000. The crew cab version can tow about 100 pounds more than the '09 3500lwb crew cab with GVWR of 12200 and GCWR of 24000. However, in '10 ram 3500lwb crew cab the GVWR stays the same but the GCWR jumps to 25400 and increases towing ability to 17950. The '10 ram 3500swb stays at GVWR 10100 and GCWR 24000. What did they do to increase the GCWR on the '10 3500lwb? All trucks have the same engine 6.7L, 4x4, 4.1 axle ratio. Normally, having a dually doesn't get you any more towing ability, just increased payload. If the GCWR just a legal designation and both can really tow the same?
