When he bent down under the table to pick them up, he noticed that Dave's wife, Sandy, was not wearing any underwear! Shocked by this, Jeff hit his head on the table and emerged red-faced.       Later when Jeff went to the kitchen to get some refreshments Sandy followed him and asked, "Did you see anything under the table that you liked?" Jeff admitted, "Well, yes I did." She said "you can have it, but it will cost you $100."       After a minute or two, Jeff indicates that he is interested. She tells him that since Dave works Friday afternoons and Jeff doesn't, that Jeff should come to their house around 2:00 PM on Friday.       Friday came and Jeff went to her house at 2:00 PM. After paying her the $100, they went to the bedroom, had sex for a few hours and then Jeff left.       Dave came home about 6:00 PM and asked his wife, "Did Jeff come by this afternoon?" Totally shocked, Sandy replied...

20060723032428AAdD1UY	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Amazing Stories of 9/11?	I have been trying to find information on a story i heard on the news (or radio or something) about an amazing guy who lived through 9/11.       I dont remember much about it, and i think Tom Clancy made a reference to it in "Teeth of the Tiger"      Supposedly, there was a guy who was way up high in one of the WTC towers. He really had no chance to get down, and his only other choice was to jump to his death.    What was amazing was how they said he survived. Now i'm not sure if it was by stairwell or what (that would make the most sense), but if i remmber this right, as the tower was collapsing, he rolled himself in a ball and rode the tower down to the floor, and survived.       If anyone knows about this story and where i can read more on it or knows who this was, or knows the whole story please respond.

20060930124602AAsiXAQ	Entertainment & Music;Music	Anybody out there play a bass guitar? Got some questions......?	I am wanting to get one and learn how to play, and I was gonna ask a few questions first. I know a 4 string would be better to learn on, but what brands would you reccomend? I can't afford a warwick or anything like that, but any suggestions? I found one I really like, its a "Oscar Schmidt by Washburn" model OB44. At a music store here in town I can get it for $229.00, or I can get it online at crossroads music for about $140. Anyone ever ordered from them before, or can reccomend a good place offline to order from? Or they have a combo at that store, it's a "Crate" bass, amp, bag, tuner, etc for $400. But I can get the OS and an amp (possibly even bigger) and all for about the same price seperate.       The amp they had to match the guitar was $129.99, but it was only 10amp? Is that good enough to practice and learn with? They had one that was $99, but it was even smaller, still 10amp, though. I think it was an Alveraz or maybe Ibanez.       Thanks!

20061124142500AA4KQeJ	Entertainment & Music;Music	Have you heard the "new" Beatles CD, "LOVE" ?  Produced by George Martin.?	This is the soundtrack for the Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas.  George Harrison and the founder of Cirque du Soleil discussed the idea of a show using the Beatles music years ago.  The only person who could do it right is George Martin, the producer of the Beatles' recordings.  George Martin and his son Giles had accsess to the original 4 track tapes.  Using state of the art technology they combined those tracks into a compilation.  George Martin, the guardian of his work with the Beatles, asked Mrs. Harrison, Yoko Ono, Paul McCarney and Ringo Starr for their approval of the project.  All thought  George paid great tribute to the Beatles.  They were amazed when they heard it.        Now all we need is for George Martin to remaster all the recordings using the technology available.  Thank God EMI, the owners of these tapes, has strict protucol for the storing of these tapes as they did for engineering the original recordings.

What are your thoughts on the 'Vanilla Fudge' album titled 'Out Through the In Door', released in 2007. IMO it's a great reunion album, and an homage to the mighty Led Zeppelin, as they cover may of their classics. Pretty cool, considering Led Zeppelin used to open shows for them back in the late 60's, and were hugely influenced by the Fudge. They take each Zeppelin number and make it their own, as only the Fudge can do, courtesy Mark Stein(Hammond/keyboard/synth/lead vocals), Carmine Appice(drums/vocals), Tim Bogert(bass/vocals), and Vince Martell(guitar/vocals). Persons unfamiliar with Vanilla Fudge...during the late 60's they were known for their own compositions, along with covering classics by The Beatles; 'Eleanor Rigby', Donovan; 'Season of the Witch', the Dusty Springfield hit; 'Windmills of Your Mind', the P.J. Proby/Dusty Springfield hit; 'I Can't Make It Alone', and their best known song, a cover of 'The Supremes' classic...You Keep Me Hangin' On.      I really enjoy this 2007 "comeback" album, and saw them a couple years ago perform live with 'The Doors of The 21 Century'...   Considering these guys were in their early - mid 60's at the time of recording this album...I find it a very interesting approach to some Led Zeppelin's classics, and proof that you're never too old to rock! I'd also like to add, that if any other band had attempted this, I doubt I would have enjoyed it. The members of Led Zeppelin and Vanilla Fudge have a tremendous amount of respect for one another, having toured together during the late 60's, etc.   Here's a few songs:      Dazed and Confused:    http://www.imeem.com/people/aKgj4Hs/musi...

20090227142039AAGClWQ	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	The Duggars aren't bad people!?	So lately I've been watching 17 (now 18) Kids and Counting, and reading up on the family.  In the past I thought they were a selfish family who only thinks about making more babies, and earning more money.  Now, I've come to realize I was wrong.  I'm truly sorry for the things I've said about the family being selfish or treating their kids badly, because I was wrong.        The church teaches us that you should never use protection when having sex, and if you get pregnant 60 times, you must keep them all, no matter what.  I think they're just following what the bible is telling them.  It's not like they're on welfare, their kids have a HUGE house, tons of opportunities and enough food and clothing.  They're teaching their kids valuable things that you can't be taught in school- for example: living with your family in peace, and loving and forgiving everyone around you no matter what.  They give to those in need, and buy used so nothing gets thrown away.  Their kids are home schooled- but why are we complaining?  They're not the only ones- there are tons of parents who home school their kids.  The kids choose to dress the way they do, they choose to stay completely pure before marriage by choice- their parents aren't forcing anything- not even faith upon them.

If you hate   my favs:   Paramore   Dragonforce      I HATE:   Jonas Brothers      Then why do you ask 'questions' about how much you hate them? Who cares if you want to get your point across. We will all know how much you hate these people if you post it on your profile. Let the fans ask their questions about the conserts and stuff. If you say how much you hate these people, others might answer those hate 'questions' instead of answering the actual help-needed questions.      P.S. TO THE JONAS BROTHERS FANS. I Don't go like "Oh, she hates the Jonas Brothers!" This question BENIFITS you.

Thirty years ago there was a Saturday morning TV show about a super hero, or maybe it was a heroine, whose mild-mannered alter ego was a teacher or counselor at a high school.

He absolutely stole the show, and I made a note of his name because I knew we'd see more of him in the future.      Except now I can't find any reference to this TV show in Craig Wasson's filmography, and everyone thinks I made the whole thing up.

Conozco metodos `para ellas y el condon pero no se de pastillas o algo que pueda usar el hombre sin que ella se de cuenta que lo estoy usando.

The bartender was busy at the other end and didn't see them when they walked in.   When he got done serving the customers there, he walked down the bar and asks the new customer what he would like.   He asks for two glasses of beer, which the barman brings.   After leaving him, the bartender goes about serving other patrons, when he notices the man has finished his beers. He asks if he would like a refill, and the man says, "Yes. I'll have a couple more. "   The barman gets two more beers and sets them in front of the man.   Never having seen anyone with the guy, his curiosity is piqued, and he asks him, "Why, do you order two drinks at a time?"   The man replies, "Oh, one is for me, and the other for my wife."   Astounded, having not seen the midget wife, the bartender says, "Your wife? Where is she?"   "She's standing here next to me."

First, I fall asleep, and I go late to my office. My boss, outrageous, fires me. When I leave the building, to my car, I found out it was stolen. The police said that they can do nothing. I get a cab to return home, and when I leave it, I remember I left my wallet and credit cards there. The cab driver just drives away."       "I go home, and when I get there, I find my wife in bed with the gardener. I leave home, and come to this bar.

20070830045622AArXDme	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Custody battle?	The scene was a tiny mountain village in a remote section of West Virginia. An old mountaineer and his young wife were getting a divorce in the local court, but custody of the children was a problem.    The mother jumped to her feet and protested to the judge that since she had brought the children into this world, she should retain custody of them.       The old mountaineer also wanted custody of the children.       The judge asked for his side of the story and, after a long moment of silence, the mountaineer slowly rose from his chair and said, "Judge, when I put a quarter in a candy machine and a candy bar comes out, does it belong to me or the machine?"

His wife looks over at   him and says, "Honey, I know we've been married for 15 years,   but, I want a divorce."      The husband says nothing but slowly increases speed to 60   mph.      She then says, "I don't want you to try to talk me out of   it, because I've been having an affair with your best friend,   and he's a much better lover than you."      Again the husband stays quiet and just speeds up as his   anger increases.      She says, "I want the house." Again the husband speeds up,   and now is doing 70 mph.      She says, "I want the kids, too."      The husband just keeps driving faster, and faster, now he's   up to 80 mph.      She says, "I want the car, the checking account, and all the   credit cards, too."      The husband slowly starts to veer toward   a bridge overpass piling, as she says, "Is there anything   you want?"      The husband says, "No, I've got everything I need."      She asks, "What's that?"

An 85-year-old man was requested by his doctor for a sperm count as part of    his physical exam.      The doctor gave the man a jar and said, 'Take this jar home and bring back a    semen sample tomorrow.'      The next day the 85-year-old man reappeared at the doctor's office and gave    him the jar, which was as clean and empty as on the previous day.      The doctor asked what happened and the man explained, 'Well, doc, it's like this - first I tried with my right hand, but nothing. Then I tried with my left hand, but still nothing. Then I asked my wife for help. She tried with her right hand, then with her left, still nothing. She tried with her mouth, first with the teeth in, then with her teeth out, still nothing.       We even called up Arleen, the lady next door and she tried too, first with both hands, then an armpit, and she even tried squeezin' it between her knees, but still nothing. The doctor was shocked! 'You asked your neighbor?'       The old man replied, 'Yep, none of us could get the jar open.'

Sitting next to the lake was an old Chinese guy skipping stones off the water. As he did, they made a sound. They sounded like this… Change----Chang-Long.   The black guy was amazed. He asked the Chinaman how he did that.      The Chinese man said, "this is an enchanted lake". When you skip a small stone across the water, it tells you about your immediate ancestry. When you skip a larger stone, it tells you about your ancient ancestry.      The Chineseman then picked up a larger stone and skipped cross the water. Long---Dong-Chow was the sound.      The black guy picked up a stone and skipped across the water. Chim---Pan-Ze was the sound. "BULL ****" he said and threw another…Chim---Pan-Ze again. Really pissed now, he picked up the largest rock he could and threw it into the water… Ba---Boon!

"Oh, by the way don't worry about my bulldog Spike. He won't bother you. But, whatever you do, do NOT, under ANY circumstances, talk to my parrot! I REPEAT, DO NOT TALK TO MY PARROT!!!"       When the repairman arrived at Wanda's apartment the following day, he discovered the biggest, meanest looking bulldog he has ever seen. But, just as she had said, the dog just lay there on the carpet watching the repairman go about his work.       The parrot, however, drove him nuts the whole time with his incessant yelling, cursing and name calling. Finally the repairman couldn't contain himself any longer and yelled, "Shut up, you stupid, ugly bird!"       To which the parrot replied, "Get him, Spike!"       Men just don't listen!

20081112090743AAp4pEu	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	I opened up a bondage shop; "Ur-In-Trouble", but senior citizens are getting the wrong idea. What should I do?	I opened up a bondage shop downtown about a week ago called Ur-In-Trouble. About 60% of my customers are confused and dissapointed senior citizens looking for Depends and prescriptions for Detrol L.A. (treatment for frequent urination).      My business partner and I didn't even stop to think about the double meaning for the shops name, and we would change it, but we've already spent over $7,000 for the neon sign for the building.        Should I just start selling adult diapers in the corner of the shop? Maybe start buying some more senior citizen related bondage items to appease the senior citizens in my town?      Any suggestions are welcome.....
20081112130258AAOGR82	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Whats that 90's song?...?	i think its from the 90's.   i have just one mini part of the song stuck in my head...   that part has no lyrics.   but her voice kinda reminds me of shakira's but softer.   the song is really soft and kind of sunny if that makes sense.   sort of like a folk rock song or pop/hippie music.   it also kind of reminds me of the cranberries but not as irish of a voice xD   im sorry for the horrible description!!   but can anyone give me any folk rock or pop/hippie bands with a girl singer that had a popular song in the 90's???   again i apologize for not being able to describe it really. D:   any help would be greatly appreciated.
