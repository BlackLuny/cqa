Ormai è così.   quella che fino a 5 anni fà era la moto migliore, oggi è ampiamente superata.   il motore è sempre fra i migliori (anche se non più IL migliore), ma risulta essere più pesante, più scomoda e più impacciata in curva rispetto alle moto giapponesi ed alle nuove ducati.

It will start and run if you twist the throttle but as soon as you let it go to idle it will die immediately like it's been switched off. When it's running at higher revs the rpm wanders all over - I can keep my hand steady on the throttle and it will go from very low idle speeds all the way up to like 5'000rpm all by itself, and then come back down randomly. It's been sitting for about a year and I'm thinking the carbs are dirty and need to have a gas bath and a good brushing. Anybody know if it could be something else based on these symptoms?

If I'm on flat ground, it has to be all the way up for it to stay, and when I'm on a hill, I put it in gear and put the e-brake on and it rolls back a little as if it's not gripping and putting it in gear is what is holding it there.

Long story short... i got the wrong battery, it was dark, cold and late... wanted to go home, so i lazily bought the battery with the terminals on opposite sides and put it in ... backwards      I realized what i did. then got the right battery and put it in. My truck does start and does run... but my deck and stereo does not even turn on.      When i put it in backwards there was alot of shocking obviously... and at one point there was a large shock inside the core of the engine that looked like a blown fuse would followed by a small cloud of smoke.      Im basically asking how bad my truck is messed up... but it does run as of right now.. And the battery light on the dash board is on

20081120071448AAUAdol	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Why does my car engine shut off completely when I apply brakes? ?	I have a 1998 Toyota Camry with 102K miles on it. I got the tune-up done lately. When I go on high speeds and apply brakes, when I need to stop at a E-Zpass toll, the car jumps a little bit and comes to halt, but at the same time the engine shuts-off. I have to bring back the car to neutral, and start the engine. But, it chokes a little while starting. What possible would be the problem. Is it because of bad transmission or brake oil. Please suggest me, what to do. I got the timing belt done too....

I have had it for a few weeks and have noticed a possible problem when I try to fill it with petrol/gas. Sometimes it fills OK but other times the petrol pump cuts out straightaway. I can still fill the tank if I VERY GENTLY press the pump but if I press it hard (as you would normally do) it just cuts out like the car's tank is full (which I know it isn't). Could this be a fault with the car? Am I not inserting the nozzle properly (although I've never had this problem with other cars)?

In my country (i'm from europe) when you pass your driving test you get a probationary license for three years. If in those 3 years you commit any offences, you'll get penalty points.  Now I got my probationary license in 2007 and I have 3 penalty points. When my probationary license will expire (in 2010) will these 3 penalty points be erased?       I'm not sure how this works out because many jobs request 'a clean driving license'! and by 'clean driving license' I understand that one has to have no driving offences whatsoever (even minor ones). am I right?

It has been lowered in the front with what my mechanic called "coil over" suspension.  It also had the factory wheels replaced with 17" wheels.  This car is nice but rides really rough (bumpy, hard hitting on holes in the road).  I suppose the larger wheels and lowered vehicle look decent, but why would anyone want to do this to a vehicle?  Is there any advantage other than looks?  Anything else I should know or expect from this type of suspension or wheel size?  Also, is there anything I can do to make this ride a little smoother?

When turning the key, I get the "BRAKE" light to come on (normally does) and a single metal clink.      Normally, that means the battery is nearly dead.      Checked the headlights, they work fine. Brights, work fine. Signals are OK, radio comes on, cab light comes on.       + Jumped it with a 2002 Chevy Impala, no help.      Spark plugs are in place and tight with the correct clamps put on, the radiator fan isn't blocked,the air filter and fuel filter have been changed within reasonable time, and the belt is in place and snug.      Here's the scenario:      Plugged the truck into the wall outlet via a battery charger because it was doing the above. Let it sit for about an hour and a half. Took the charger off, no start. Plugged it back on, and the truck IMMEDIATELY started up.      Drove the truck down to the local dump, turned it off (stupidly) and took care of the recyclables. Went to turn the truck on, nothing. All the above happens, before narrating the scenario.      ANY clue? We're in deep crap with the local association if we leave a busted truck in their dump yard.

Well Im 17, and i just recently got a new part-time job, while still going to school, now im ready to drive already but the only problem is i don't have my own car. I asked my parents if i could buy a used car, and they said yeah, but i have to make my own payments on it. I've been looking up used cars and one caught my eye. It is a used 2004 Mazda rx-8 with an automatic transmission. Now im planning on getting this car but i'm still debating on weither or not i should. I heard that there are a couple minor probblems with this car, and that you have to mantain it. I don't mind maintaing the car, because what car doesn't need some maintenece, right. and i know that you have to let it warm up before you start to drive. But what are some other requirments needed? I heard about the oil checkup also, but what type of oil should i use???? I asked my brother if he knew anything and he told me some information, but then said to get a second opinon, please don't tell me im to young to have this car, im probably the most mature one out of my siblings, but I don't know anything about rotary engines so any positive information would be much appreciated.

20090223000132AA1FgbV	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	Any ideas for my first dirt bike?	I'm about to be 21yrs old. 5'4 and about 120lbs. I want it mainly for playing around (small jumps, short races, & just riding around). I'm probably bringing it to Costa Rica which only has dirt roads where I'll be, mountains everywhere and A LOT of potholes so it has to be durable and more easy to maneuver.

20090223002554AAVNqsT	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Dodge	1996 Dodge Avenger Camshaft position sensor 2.5L vs 2.0L?	My check engine light just registered a camshaft sensor fault from the OBD machine and I was told that the V6 2.5L doesn't have an independent camshaft sensor and that I would have to replace the entire distributor. Only the 2.0L I4 has the independent sensor that can be replaced solely.   I was just wondering if this was true or not and if it's not true then where can I find the cam sensor for my V6?

My car is due its 2 year service (the big one) the main dealer wants ￡225 for this i can get it done outside of peugeot for ￡75. ￡150 is a big difference, and yes the other garage will be using peugeot approved parts.
