51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	It is baptism.     Catholics and Protestants agree that to be saved, you have to be born again. Jesus said so: "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God" (John 3:3).     When a Catholic says that he has been "born again," he refers to the transformation that Gods grace accomplished in him during baptism. Evangelical Protestants typically mean something quite different when they talk about being "born again."     For an Evangelical, becoming "born again" often happens like this: He goes to a crusade or a revival where a minister delivers a sermon telling him of his need to be "born again."     "If you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and believe he died for your sins, youll be born again!" says the preacher. So the gentleman makes "a decision for Christ" and at the altar call goes forward to be led in "the sinners prayer" by the minister. Then the minister tells all who prayed the sinners prayer that they have been saved"born again." But is the minister right? Not according to the Bible.     These different ways of talking about being "born again" describe effects of baptism, which Christ speaks of in John 3:5 as being "born of water and the Spirit." In Greek, this phrase is, literally, "born of water and Spirit," indicating one birth of water-and-Spirit, rather than "born of water and of the Spirit," as though it meant two different birthsone birth of water and one birth of the Spirit.     In the water-and-Spirit rebirth that takes place at baptism, the repentant sinner is transformed from a state of sin to the state of grace. Peter mentioned this transformation from sin to grace when he exhorted people to "be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 2:38).     The context of Jesus statements in John 3 makes it clear that he was referring to water baptism. Shortly before Jesus teaches Nicodemus about the necessity and regenerating effect of baptism, he himself was baptized by John the Baptist, and the circumstances are striking: Jesus goes down into the water, and as he is baptized, the heavens open, the Holy Spirit descends upon him in the form of a dove, and the voice of God the Father speaks from heaven, saying, "This is my beloved Son" (cf. Matt. 3:1317; Mark 1:911; Luke 3:2122; John 1:3034). This scene gives us a graphic depiction of what happens at baptism: We are baptized with water, symbolizing our dying with Christ (Rom. 6:3) and our rising with Christ to the newness of life (Rom. 6:45); we receive the gift of sanctifying grace and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13; Gal. 3:27); and we are adopted as Gods sons (Rom. 8:1517).     After our Lords teaching that it is necessary for salvation to be born from above by water and the Spirit (John 3:121), "Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea; there he remained with them and baptized" (John 3:22).     Then we have the witness of the early Church that John 3:5 refers to baptismal regeneration. This was universally recognized by the early Christians. The Church Fathers were unanimous in teaching this.    Evangelicals and Calvinists try to deal with the other verses where new life is attributed to baptism either by ignoring them or by arguing that it is not actually water baptism that is being spoken of. The problem for them is that water is explicitly mentioned or implied in each of these verses.     In Acts 2:38, people are exhorted to take an action: "Be baptized . . . in the name of Jesus Christ," which does not refer to an internal baptism that is administered to people by themselves, but the external baptism administered to them by others.     We are told that at Pauls conversion, "he rose and was baptized, and took food and was strengthened. For several days he was with the disciples at Damascus" (Acts 9:1819). This was a water baptism. In Romans 6 and Colossians 2, Paul reminds his readers of their water baptisms, and he neither says nor implies anything about some sort of "invisible spiritual baptism."     In 1 Peter 3, water is mentioned twice, paralleling baptism with the flood, where eight were "saved through water," and noting that "baptism now saves you" by the power of Christ rather than by the physical action of water "removing . . . dirt from the body."     The anti-baptismal regeneration position is indefensible. It has no biblical basis whatsoever.|`|HgVLhCr9aa	Like Jews and Catholics, there are 'cultural' "Christians".  They pretend to be Christians, consider themselves to be "Christians", but live a life much like anyone else, without considering God as they walk daily in their lives.    The born again Christian is one who has been changed by God in a "salvation experience".  These are the 'true' Chrisitans.  Together they form what has been termed the 'invisible church'.    You can tell the two apart by looking at how they act.  By seeing what kind of 'fruit' they yield.    "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control"|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	"Born again" has become a denomination all it's own.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Jesus said to be born again.  That's the only way to get into heaven.  It's not by religion or works or water baptism or anything else.     The only way to be born again, is by believing the truth about Jesus without adding any of your own works.     Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|4c979acd3ee945a6e63181337a60c6e7aa	think fundie|`|LLey4VRzaa	To forget everything you learned and everything you were taught...and start over, be Born Again.

dlaqQE6Xaa	.  Sometimes humorous answers can make one feel ever so much better.    I will venture one that I heard.    I asked my neighbor the very same question in the 80s and he said:    "Shoot his sister".    (Yes, could be brother.....).    Regardless of who "you people" are it is usually a total "jack-icicle" that makes those remarks to anyone.    I think that it was Shakespeare that said "A "Jack-Ice" by any other name would smell as rancid as the stall it was born in". . . . or some such thing.    If you feel that the event was only "an awkward moment" then the best way over the problem is to pretend and ignore it.    If you feel that Mr. AH is just one of "those types" then he will never be anything else, until he understands that it is really not appreciated.    One important question you could ask yourself is how does / should / would your man handle the situation if he knew (knows?) how it hurt you......   and, if you should let him know.    Helpful?

God's omnipotence is bound by what is consistent with the application of logic.    Therefore, he cannot make round triangles, etc, etc.|`|y2VcJ0t8aa	Trying to pit God omnipotence against itself is a fatal fail for you.|`|mxe86blRaa	This question is frequently asked by skeptics of God, the Bible, Christianity, etc. If God can create a rock that He cannot lift, then God is not omnipotent. If God cannot create a rock so heavy that He cannot lift it, then God is not omnipotent. According to this argument, omnipotence is self-contradictory. Therefore, God cannot be omnipotent. So, the question, could God create a rock so heavy He could not lift it? The quick answer is "No." But the explanation is far more important to understand than the answer...    This question is based on a popular misunderstanding about the definitions of words like "almighty" or "omnipotent." These terms do not mean that God can do anything. Rather, they describe the amount of God's power. Power is the ability to effect change - to make something happen. God (being unlimited) has unlimited power, and the Bible affirms this (Job 11:7-11, 37:23; 2 Corinthians 6:18; Revelation 4:8; etc.). Therefore, God can do whatever is possible to be done. God cannot, however, do that which is actually impossible. This is because true impossibility is not based on the amount of power one has, it is based on what is really possible. The truly impossible is not made possible by adding more power. Therefore, unless context indicates otherwise (e.g. Matthew 19:26 where man's ability is being shown in contrast to God's), impossibility means the same thing whether or not God is involved.    So, the first part of the question is based on a false idea - that God being almighty means that He can do anything. In fact, the Bible itself lists things God cannot do - like lie or deny Himself (Hebrews 6:18; 2 Timothy 2:13; Titus 1:2). The reason He cannot do these things is because of His nature and the nature of reality itself. God cannot do what is not actually possible to be done, like creating a two-sided triangle, or a married bachelor. Just because words can be strung together this way does not make the impossible possible - these things are contradictions, they are truly impossible in reality. Now, what about this rock? A rock would have to be infinitely large to defeat an infinite amount of lifting power. But an infinite rock is a contradiction since material objects cannot be infinite. Only God is infinite. There cannot be two infinites. So the question is actually asking if God can make a contradiction - which He cannot.|`|Nv3eQenUaa	No.   If he can lift our sins than he can lift the heaviest rock.   Everything is just a reflection of his creation and thus exists beneath him.|`|MPgAtqlVaa	omg thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! everyone i know doesn't capitalize their names and you capitalized God!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! thank you, again.|`|RNUCiRhqaa	I just pooped myself i was trying to fart and it just came out.|`|rroE37HTaa	God can't "lift" human free will that He gave to us!   Well maybe he just chooses not to!|`|500b0fe5bfd90198931c2235e47b33efaa	If the Infinite can be expressed as less than Infinite, then it is finite.  Therefore, it is a question of putting limits on infinite, a contradiction of terms, since infinite implies no limits.|`|AA11668191	I like Jesus Freak's answer, but I thought I could add a little to show the silliness of the question. The question is impossible in itself before omnipotence even enters into it. To 'lift' assumes that an object is gravitationally tied to another much larger mass. That's why everything isn't just floating around separately in space, right? So to make the heaviest object is to make an object with the greatest mass and thereby greatest gravity in the universe. There's no lifting such a thing because it is by its nature the thing you would lift all other things from.
peybb4Foaa	Mafia is more organized and they earn 10 times more.As soon as you get in the way of their money they will kill you.Gangs tend to be more..well "Sissy" if that's the word.  The mafia members tend to be more independent too.    If you insult a gang member he will shoot you and go to prison.  If you insult a mafia member he will kill you at your house with an axe and then bury you somewhere 100 miles away from the city.    Many people say that mafia has less people well thats not usually true.  A gang "click" is usually about 20-100 people  A typical mafia has about the same number.There is 1-2 leaders and many many soldiers  + associates  So that means they have even more people than gangs.

It is absolutely amazing and beyond words to describe.|`|4QizPDQNaa	Why believe in a creator if he isn't great enough to have created everything? The idea of God is that He's all-powerful and all-knowing; if He's not, then believing in Him is pretty much a waste of time. It's pointless to believe in a God with limitations. If there were a bunch of intelligent powers working together to create everything, then each one individually would be relatively "weak" and not worth putting faith in. A supreme being wouldn't be defeated by the size of what he created, unless you view him to be like Frankenstein who was overwhelmed by his creation simply because he did not fully realize all of the implications of his plan (def. not all-knowing). You're right, we can't fathom "it's" abilities. If we could, then we would know and understand everything and therefore we would be God. And yes, it seems crazy to believe that such a one notices or cares about us. But Christianity holds that we are specially created in the image of God--His children in a sense--so He wants to be involved in our lives, just as a good parent wants to be involved in the lives of his children. In fact, Christians believe that He went so far as to come to earth in the form of a man to experience life among us. The universe is huge but it does not necessarily follow that God is small. Of course, on earth when we see a magnificent structure, we don't assume an intelligent giant created it, We understand that it took the time and energy of many men. But things on earth have a definite beginning and end. The universe is different. We have no perfect idea when or how the universe and life as we know it came to be, and we could never create anything like it. This implies a higher intelligence. And it would be a great assumption to attribute the limitations of man to a higher intelligence. Why should it require numerous beings to create what we see, or one who lacks the ability to manage all that he made? I think our idea of God is simply too small, as opposed to the size of the universe being too large.
79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	>To people who believe in evolution, why didn't dinosaurs have a missile defense shield?    If you mean an artificial missile defense system, they simply weren't intelligent enough to become technological and achieve something of that sort.    If you mean a naturally evolved missile defense system, for one thing that would be rather hard for biological organisms to get in the first place and for another thing there was no selection pressure to evolved such a mechanism.    >If the dinosaurs were around for hundreds of millions of years why didn't they evolve intelligence greater than humans.    Evidently either the necessary level of selection pressure for intelligence simply wasn't there, or the dinosaurs' biological characteristics made it harder for them to develop intelligence than for mammals. I suspect that both of these are factors, but that the former is much more the case than the latter. Keep in mind that intelligence in humans has evolved mostly over the past few million years, during which time the Earth has been subjected to a series of ice ages. These ice ages have followed cycles rather closer to the short end of the evolutionary timescale, meaning that it is difficult for organisms to evolve to meet each one as it comes, and evolve again when it ends; a type of creature with the ability to survive through making decisions through higher-level reasoning and ultimately using artificial tools to aid its survival has more of an advantage under these conditions. The dinosaurs, on the other hand, lived during a period when the Earth was fairly warm pretty much all the time, so having intelligence was not as large of an advantage.    >Dinosaurs had little claws for gripping like our hands.    Not all of them would have been successful in this regard. There were many forms of dinosaurs, including a large number that walked on all four feet (like cows and horses and elephants) and thus had no front legs available to manipulate objects. Furthermore, in those carnivorous dinosaurs which walked upright, the claws were developed more for slashing at prey than for handling objects; your best bet would have been some kind of two-legged herbivore (maybe a hadrosaur or a pachycephalosaur) that used its front feet for reaching plant material. However, herbivores have less of an incentive to develop intelligence than carnivores do, and it is understood that the small, pack-hunting carnivores were probably the most intelligent dinosaurs, with the troodon being the most common example.    >Dinosaurs were around for hundreds of millions of years. Wouldn't the most intelligent species eventually overtake the dumber ones.    This idea of intelligent species 'overtaking' dumber ones and subjugating them is really only a phenomenon that happens on a human level of intelligence. Even the other apes, which are probably a lot smarter than even the smartest dinosaurs, make use of their intelligence for more coordination inside groups than for active dominance over other species. You don't see chimpanzees putting other creatures in cages or pens, domesticating other creatures, etc, those are things that of all the animals that have ever existed on Earth, only humans are smart enough to do.    >Then the smarter ones should have figured out science. Like we have in only 20,000 years or so.    Where do you get your 20000-year figure? Humans have apparently been using tools in one form or another for as much as a million years, and were significantly smarter than any dinosaur even for at least several million years before that. And as I mentioned, the more recent developments in our intelligence, and pretty much all our developments in tool use up to the past 10000 years or so, were probably due to the ice ages, which were not around when the dinosaurs were alive.|`|ZRtnCFU3aa	Anyone who does NOT think this is a bizzare, and profoundly ignorant question, has had a lobotomy.

0yTM98Odaa	Matthew 5:38- "You have heard it was said, 'Eye for an eye, and tooth for a tooth' But I tell you, do not resist an evil person.  If someone strikes you  on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.  And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.  If someone forces you you to go one mile, go with him 2 miles.  Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you"    Matthew 5:44:  "But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you"    Matthew 4:46 "If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect"    Matthew 22:39- "Love your neighbour as yourself"-  By neighbour naturally Jesus means everyone.    Romans 14:1-3 "Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment on disputable matters.  One mans faith allows him to eat everything, but another man, whose faith is weak only eats vegetables.  The man who eats everything must not look down on him who does not, and the man who does not eat everything must not condemn the man who does, for God has accepted him"    It does say however to not be yoked with unbelievers in Romans:  Romans 6:14- "Do not be yoked together with unbelievers"- This however I think was referring to marriage, and this is only because of the lack of things we would have in common.-  Romans 6:15- "What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?"    Yes Jesus was tolerant of everyone.  He forgave those who crucified him!  He also healed gentiles for example the Canaanite woman.      Matthew 15:25- "The woman came and knelt before him.  'Lord, help me!' she said.  He replied 'It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs'  'Yes Lord' she said but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table.  "Then Jesus answered 'Woman you have great faith', your request is granted"    He was testing her faith, because you have to have faith for Jesus to heal you and also for salvation.    Jesus came for the whole world not just the Jews like many people say.    Jesus chose the Apostle Paul to preach the Gospel to gentiles, see-  Acts 9:15- "But the Lord said to Ananais, "Go, this man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before the gentiles and their kings and before the people of Israel."    In Christianity we are taught to treat everyone how we wish to be treated and love everyone.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	It doesn't say to kill them, if that's what you're asking.  It doesn't say to persecute them, either...even if they persecute you first.    Jesus says not to practice "eye-for-an-eye" retribution.  Matthew 5:38-42    Jesus says for us to love our enemies.  Matthew 5:43-48    Jesus touched the leperous.  He healed those of different beliefs (gentiles)...    Christianity is an all-encompassing belief system when it is properly followed.  You do not have to believe in the Old Testament form of Judaism to be a Christian.  The Old Testament is merely the "history" or backdrop for the coming of Christ.  As a matter of fact, you do not need a religion at all.    Why don't you look to see how Paul responded to the false idols in Athens?  Acts 17:16-34.  He didn't destroy their idols or condemn them to an eternity of hellfire.    Also, see Paul's response as to eating food sacrificied to idols.  1 Corinthians 8.  It was rather "open-minded" if you ask me.    Christians are merely advised not to participate in the practices of other faiths like paganism.  They are not told to condemn them or fight them (even if the pagans fight first.)|`|DIlNnjf8aa	Christianity teaches their test of a true believer:    "And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover."  Mark 16:17-18  King James Version    So it says that unbelievers will be subject to deadly poisons, but not Christians.    Curiously, you never read about Christians drinking Drano. Dunno why that is.|`|JNr86XAVaa	Muslim accept Jesus Christ as a Prophet of Islam and according to Quran he was not crucified.We are not against Jesus Christ assalathu wasalam.We are not against the any holy book from Allah to the Prophets, Moses,Ibrahim,Jesus Christ and muhammed.|`|iMplzgBtaa	Jesus was tolerant of other people regardless of their religious beliefs.  He came to teach the true word of God and to teach to love our neighbors and to be tolerant.  He taught what was the way to get to heaven and be with our Heavenly Father and taught that if one did not follow that way then they would go to hell according to God's word. He did not personally condemn others.  Christianity teaches tolerance of all of mankind, it is the Christians, themselves, who either follow or not.  Sometimes when a Christian is spreading the word of God they are considered to be intolerant or judgmental, but they are not, they are simply telling what God said to do.

Talk to them about it if you want to.  It is like telling people from some countries who do not use deorderant that they are now in a country where it is required - their entry to this country does not come with a handbook of all the things we do differently, it takes time for them to acclimate, and people are quick to mention some offences, but others are less bothersome, so a person can be in another country for years without getting an update that some behaviors are unacceptable in their new location.  Some men from the Middle East are rude to women who are traveling or eating alone, because in Muslim countries, this is not acceptable behavior - it can take time to get them to mind their manners according to the traditions of the country they are in now, rather than where they came from.  Americans are not the only people who can be "ugly" abroad.|`|q5RGBoMIaa	um hello! it's not because they're asian, it's because they're rude!

LsHsDHx3aa	Well, if you love guys, it means you are definately not gay, if you have these emotions towards ONE person, then you are probably confused, and probably won't end up being gay or bisexual, if these emtions are towards more then one individual girl, then chances are you are bisexual.|`|AQPmrsVSaa	While some people like to define sexuality as 100% straight, 100% gay, or 50/50 bi, there is such a thing as being a little gay. That is, having some attraction to the same sex that isn't as strong as your attraction to the opposite sex. Lots of girls are attracted to other girls while still having a strong preference for guys. You might be one of them.    But! You might also just be getting warm bubbly feelings from having such a close friend that you care about. Love for friends can be as powerful an emotion as love for lovers, after all.|`|nfn01Xsfaa	mm... i dont want to label ur sexuality for you... cuz i think you will find out for yourself..    but if you think you may be bisexual.. it just means its a gift for you to be able to love people of the same gender as much as you love poeple of the opposite gender..    when u have a close relationship with a friend, its normal to feel attracted to her and have really nice feelings when you hug her..    because i was "in love" with my bestfriend before too. we were close and i felt attracted as a result.    i think you could just treasure the fact htat you have such a wonderful relationship with a girl friend.    if she still loves adn accepts u the way you are. then its fine..    in time, you may meet someone (a girl) who reciprocates your feelings...

KrkftOfkaa	Really...you should read all the original Grimm's Fairy Tales that they watered down for their older movies.  They do clean up a few of the, now-a-days, not socially acceptable for little kids details to keep the easy G rating.    The original Cinderella is kind of fun.  The two step-sisters cut off their toes (and one cuts off her heel if I recall) in an attempt to fit into the slipper.  Cinderella's little bird friends peck out her step-sister's eyes at her wedding.  And the step mother is put in to red-hot iron shoes and "made to dance to death" in them.  :)|`|294e1701917b0ab03a81e21b3d809bd2aa	yeah-- and the y make all the characters have the bland personalities  of generic subrurban families.|`|Oll0CHkbaa	It doesn't bother me much more than the alterations to the original fairy tales have restructured the stories for the rest of the Disney movies.

I've learned to take it at face value as their own interpretation on the story instead of the real story, but the kids who never learn why they should read don't learn the real stories and myths.|`|513708e4dfd3b88a9b7ce59087ef82aeaa	It used to, but now I have just accepted that when it comes to entertainment, its all about making money.

Children learn things in their own time. I'll bet you may have learned cute "fairytales" before you ever heard of Bulfinch's Mythology. The important thing is to balance out the child's learning with facts as they are able to comprehend and digest them.|`|N9VN9bwfaa	Disney was doing this with Grimm's fairy tales before I was even born, you know.  Most stories that are traditional are not appropriate for small children.  The ancient Greeks had some pretty nasty stuff, you know.  Besides that, Hercules had at least 3 different versions and 3 different names.  Sometimes he wasn't even Hercules!  People have been complaining about Disney creating sugar-coated, sanitized versions of stories for generations now, so this is nothing new.  But I raised some kids of my own and didn't much enjoy walking the floors with them after nightmares caused by thoughtless TV shows or movies that were too graphic.  Nor did I much enjoy those nightmares as a little tyke myself, 25 years earlier.  My parents preferred getting a good night's sleep, in their day, too, as I recall.  they didn't care for hearing 6 kids screaming and crying, "Mommy!  Daddy!  I had a bad dream!  That icky monster from the movie came out from under my bed and tried to eat me!"  And then having to let us all join them in bed.  No, no, it's much better to sanitize!  Believe me!    Kids can always grow up, get interested in this stuff, and then read the real thing themselves later.  THEN they can find out all the gory details and stay up late being too scared to turned off the lights when it won't disturb Mom's rest!

The Josephus passage is certainly a much later forged addition, because such Christian writers as Origen weren't aware of it a century or two after Josephus' time, it's badly out of context, Josephus was a Pharisee and wouldn't speak so favorably of Jesus, and he said much more about John the Baptist and many men who claimed to be the Messiah. Pliny only says there were Christians in his time, and no skeptic denies that. His writing doesn't prove anything about Jesus' existence.Tacitus doesn't use the name Jesus, and there were many men who claimed to be "Christus" (Anointed One) and Josephus listed some of them, so Tacitus could be discussing any of many men. Suetonius mentioned "Chrestus", not "Christus", in his "Lives of the Caesars". Chrestus is the Latin form of a common Greek name and has nothing to do with Christus, so you're just blindly repeating wrong information without understanding it. Phlegan and Celsus don't prove anything either. The punchline is that I'm an educated Catholic, and I have friends who are atheists. They've shown me that all of the things you list have been refuted. They only laugh at you for blindly repeating nonsense, and I have ambivalent feelings about it. You make me doubt my Christianity, because you show me that the Bible is the only actual proof that Jesus really lived.

And again, "That a few simple men should in one generation have invented so powerful and appealing a personality, so lofty an ethic and so inspiring a vision of human brotherhood, would be a miracle far more incredible than any recorded in the Gospels" (Ibid., p. 557).|`|IqqaA2wIaa	WE ALL KNOW HE DID LIVE AND HE STILL DOES!!!!!!!!|`|IQIMyE5Naa	This is the site you need.|`|KrTkyc9Faa	"They related that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion and that he was alive.

Mainly because as a christian I know the grave is not the end & this life is but a instant. But I don't believe the Lord wants me to give up my will to survive just because I take risks.    Yes, you can have both though. Never does the Bible say we're supposed to give up just because the situation seems hopeless. There are plenty of instances where someone has risked their own life to save another. Policemen, firemen, etc. do it daily. They make every possible move to insure their survival. But if it's absolutely impossible to save someone they don't risk going in because 2 dying doesn't make any sense. Yet they still risk it to the extreme.    Though morality would cause you to take risks others might not it doesn't mean you won't take every means available to survive.

So these children grow up to be adults thinking that they are all that and go through life believing the lie.  some do well through life by ignoring those who point out the facts to them (that they are in fact ugly and stupid); they die happy and content of their imagined beauty, intelligence, and importance.  There are a number who accept the reality early enough in life and go through life without much difficulty as ugly and stupid individuals, which is just fine and more acceptable than leading a life of denial and delusion.|`|AA11101968	Religion is the opiate of the masses.|`|HNSHwnJ8aa	I feel particular allegiance to people who use ketchup on their eggs.

I, however, do not share this passion about things that I don't feel is truly in my control - no matter how much griping I do about who's in office and what they're NOT doing. I am very passionate about music and its underlying tones of truth within it. I am also very passionate about art - particularly those of extreme "oddness". It's almost like looking into the spirit of the person who created it and I wonder what they were feeling and thinking as they were doing it. Other than "artsy" stuff, I am quite passionate about spirituality - NOT religion. I find that seeking truth within a person is highly important - that religion does not define the person, but the person defines the religion.

Whether in novel or essay form, a narrative piece of writing transports readers into the time and space of the world portrayed by the writing.    There's also nothing like writing a great narrative. Through reflecting upon an event, and through recreating the experience for other readers, writing a narrative essay can enable you to develop new, subtle, and rewarding perspectives.    Basic qualities of a narrative essay:        *          A narrative essay is a piece of writing that recreates an experience through time.      *          A narrative essay can be based on one of your own experiences, either past or present, or it can be based on the experiences of someone else.      *          In addition to telling a story, a narrative essay also communicates a main idea or a lesson learned.      First steps for writing a narrative essay:        *          Identify the experience that you want to write about.      *          Think about why the experience is significant.      *          Spend a good deal of time drafting your recollections about the details of the experience.      *          Create an outline of the basic parts of your narrative.      Writing about the experience:        *          Using your outline, describe each part of your narrative.      *          Rather than telling your readers what happened, use vivid details and descriptions to actually recreate the experience for your readers.      *          Think like your readers. Try to remember that the information you present is the only information your readers have about the experiences.      *          Always keep in mind that all of the small and seemingly unimportant details known to you are not necessarily known to your readers.      Communicating the significance of the experience:        *          It's often effective to begin your narrative with a paragraph that introduces the experience and communicates the significance. This technique guarantees that your readers will understand the significance of the experience as they progess through the narrative.      *          Another effective technique is to begin the essay by jumping directly into the narrative and then ending the essay with a paragraph communicating the significance of the experience. This approach allows your readers to develop their own understanding of the experience through the body of the essay and then more deeply connect to your expression of the significance at the end.      *          You might also consider introducing the experience in the first paragraph but delaying your expression of the significance of the experience until the end of the essay. This approach heightens your readers' sensitivity to the significance of the narrative.      Revising your narrative essay:        *          After spending time away from the draft of your narrative essay, read through the essay and think about whether the writing effectively recreates the experience for your readers.      *          Ask other people to read through the essay and offer their impressions.      *          Identify where more details and descriptions are needed.      *          Identify and consider removing any information that seems to distract from the focus and main narrative of the essay.      *          Think about whether you've presented information in the most affective order.      Potential prompts for your narrative essay:    If you're having trouble choosing an experience to write about, take a quick glance through these prompts. They might help you remember or identify a particularly interesting or significant experience to focus on.        *          A childhood event. Think of an experience when you learned something for the first time, or when you realized how important someone was for you.      *          Achieving a goal. Think about a particularly meaningful achievement in your life. This could be something as seemingly minor as achieving a good grade on a difficult assignment, or this could be something with more long-lasting effects, like getting the job you desired or getting into the best school to which you applied.      *          A failure. Think about a time when you did not perform as well as you had wanted. Focusing on an experience like this can result in rewarding reflections about the positive emerging from the negative.      *          A good or bad deed. Think about a time when you did or did not stand up for yourself or someone else in the face of adversity or challenge.      *          A change in your life. Think about a time when something significant changed in your life. This could be anything from a move across town to a major change in a relationship to the birth or death of a loved one.      *          A realization. Think about a time when you experienced a realization. This could be anything from understanding a complicated math equation to gaining a deeper understanding of a phil|`|l2xVPse2aa	first create a character then give him traits? is he nice funny strong witty brave? all questions you can ask yourself. as for paragraphs as many as tells the story. for a short one 4 to 6 but a long one more than 15. to create a story create a boy (or girl) who is like a farm boy or something that goes out of his element as a city boy. it could be anyone going out of his comfort zone or someone who must take the skills he has and use them. remember all good stories have a well thought out characters that people like a reasonable explanation for an adventure and a bad situation that must be made good.
U24VtSlZaa	The Bible's "strong stand against the effeminate" is not at all clear to me.  I don't think Jesus practiced gender discrimination -- I can see all kinds of practical reasons for all 12 to be men.      Bottom line, there's no Biblical reason for you to wear or not wear a necklace.  If for any reason you feel you shouldn't, then don't. Otherwise, go for it.    "Pity the fool who thinks necklaces are effeminate."  -- Mr. T (paraphrased)|`|IqqaA2wIaa	I wouldnt....its feminine...|`|rGEZup0Zaa	I believe when men wear them they're called "chains".

It is in no way effeminate for men to wear necklaces, generally speaking, since men have been wearing them since man developed tribes.  They have been worn to ward off evil spirits, as talismans of the warrior's virtues, RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS and even as signs of position and power within the various kingdoms and empires throughout Europe since before the rise of the Greeks.    There is no negative spiritual connotations for wearing a necklace, as long as it is an appropriate type for your gender (so a woman's necklace is right out).    The general effeminate connotation is an early 20th century affectation which no longer applies, socially.    I am sure that your priest is a fine theologian, but he has a piss poor grasp of human sociology and human history.|`|641c55ed860a473abbc5c57c2b35186aaa	Men in biblical times wore what we call now "dresses" which is effeminate.  Who decides what is effeminate or what is not?  Society?  Priests? I will tell you who decides...it is a judgmental person and there is no room for judgmental people in true christianity.      Sin is not in the wearing of the necklace it is in the reason you are wearing the necklace.  If you have no ill intentions to hurt another then there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.  Now if it bothers your priest then you should definitely take it off in his presence because you do not want to insult him and his beliefs.  Just as you wouldn't sit at the same table with a jewish person and eat some food that you know they are against eating.  It is respect.    All of us have the living spirit inside of us and IF we have no bad intentions in doing things and live by the spirit, listen to the spirit in YOU (not in your priest) and by having faith in that living spirit then we are saved.  The necklace has no sin....it is your intentions that bring about the sin.  The priest could never wear the necklace because the spirit within him tells him it is wrong for him, and maybe in a year the spirit will tell you it is wrong also....it is your path...listen to the spirit inside you and in your heart you will know.
PjwWWMu4aa	I am not a Christian, and not even vaguely religious. But I thought I'd answer anyway, because I think maybe it'll be interesting.    My view on it is, that it should be symmetrical with death. That is, we generally accept death to mean the cessation of neural function. The soul has left the body at that point, if you want. So it should be the same at the beginning of life, too. There's clearly a point before which there's no cognitive function - there's no brain! And, though I realise the potential for life is greater in a foetus than a dying person, that's the age I would say life as we give it any definition begins.    So I would say that abortion under that age is not as heinous as abortion over that age (I think, if I remember correctly, its about 2 months into pregnancy), which might well be considered murder.    I'm not keen on the idea as a whole, and certainly should be discouraged. But definitely legal; people are always going to abort, and its better its regulated and sterile rather than a back alley and a coat hanger.|`|1bd6f7dcd94b559f97fdb31387c7926faa	Personally, I do not believe in abortion.  I would not have an abortion myself unless there were extenuating circumstances (rape, medical maladies, etc.).  But that would still be killing, wouldn't it?  However, I do not believe that I have the right to make decisions for others.  "Thou shalt not kill".  4 simple words if taken literally means we are all going straight to hell.  Abortion is not the only way to "kill".  There is killing in war, self defense, accidentally, out of fear or the worst, out of malice.  And if we are taking it literally then there is killing by letting people starve to death by not sharing what food we could and should with the hungry. As I recall, God said, "Give to Caesar what is Ceaesar's".  Everything I've read about that scripture says that God was in essence telling us that even tho' we believed and worshiped Him (the Almighty) that we were responsible for paying our taxes and obeying the laws of the land (government).  In my opinion and it's just my opinion, people are concentrating on the literal meaning of words too much.  But if they really want to concentrate on one, they should concentrate on forgiveness first and foremost.  A question to ponder is:  "Who is a killer, the man sitting in the electric chair for taking another's life or the man pulling the switch to end his life"?  No where in the Bible does God break killing down into categories.  And yet He makes us understand that forgiveness is all encompassing.|`|ncXMA6rsaa	Sometimes it is necessary.|`|y2VcJ0t8aa	Abortion is murder      I am anti abortion, anti war and anti capital punishment.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Safe, legal, and rare.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	Even when I was an atheist, I always wondered why was it OK to kill someone just because they couldn't speak up for themselves?

Woman's body, woman's choice.    Keep in mind that being pro-choice doesn't mean pro-abortion.  I wouldn't have an abortion myself except in certain circumstances (like rape or risking my life), but I support the right of other women to do what they wish with their own bodies.  Pregnancy seriously restricts a woman's freedom:  they can't drink, smoke, or do any strenuous activities and being pregnant can ruin their lives in several different ways.|`|b71a9fcb4e3cb531cd27f67e3f40102daa	It's legal.  And a necessary evil in this overpopulated world with limited food/air.|`|aPuj6xoHaa	Abortion is murder in any and all circumstances.  Life begins at conception and the baby is not part of the woman's body, so it is not her "choice".  God does not condone murder of innocent lives.      Exodus 20:13  "You shall not murder."     Isaiah 44:24  Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, who formed you from the womb: "I am the LORD, who made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who spread out the earth by myself,     Isaiah 49:15  "Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you.     Luke 1:41  And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb.    [proving life in the womb]|`|fNw4wJSGaa	I'm not Christian. I'm not a believer of any kind.    I don't like abortion. I would never choose to have one myself. I take precautions to ensure that I don't get pregnant until I'm ready to have a child.      that being said, I find it extremely hard, to classify a mass of dividing cells in a woman's uterus "human".    I find it disgusting that the moment a woman finds out she's pregnant, it seems her life, rights, and feelings, seem to evaporate or become secondary to that of the embryo.    Once the fetus stands a reasonable chance of living outside the womb, then and only then, do I think that it is almost unconscionable to abort; accept in extreme medical circumstances, an in a few very extreme set of unfortunate circumstances.     Such as very young rape victims, who don't know they are pregnant because they haven't even started menstruation yet, or are too scared or embarrassed to come forward and say they are pregnant.    And yes, CHILDREN as young as 9 have popped up pregnant after a sexual assault. Other children a bit older 11, 12 and so on, have been victims of incest and denied abortions.    ANYONE who thinks that making a child and rape victim carry that pregnancy to term is a good thing, is beyond me.    It's cool to be pro-life, but I would hope even pro-lifer's would have hearts and not allow that kind of suffering!|`|AA10226964	It is an option that they gave people today.  I truly do not believe in aborting a child.  It was taught in school that if you became pregnant with a child, you should have it in a hospital, but if you can't afford your child, then you should not have gotten pregnant in the first place.  I don't believe in having sex before marriage.  And having a child.  just to marry the boy who got you pregnant.|`|MGvN5xrNaa	I agree, Abortion is murder!

Someone on here said this.|`|nQPcbjLKaa	Abortion is the taking of human life and so is not therefore the same as murder. As long as rape is legal there will be a lot of abortion. In America Christians all say they don't believe in divorce or abortion, until the social workers attack that is. When the choice is divorce or they will sacrifice your children to the foster farm where there is an 80% chance they will be beaten, raped, and or starved, guess what? They get divorced! Yeah. Then the whres attack and try to force birth control pills on your 12 year old daughters because the fleminist knows that pimps like her aren;t going to put out so she's going to make town pumps out of the widows and orphans (also known as single mothers with children). Then when your 12 year old has been raped like dog like by some slimy 35 year old lowlife living in a trailer park, guess what! She's going to get an abortion! Yeah. The fleminists are all going to make big fat hypocrites out of us all aren't they? When the real revolution comes kill the pimps that rule and slap down their lackey whres.

Thou shalt not kill, period (the New Testament, not old). However, we aren't living in a Christian world, and sin is rampant. I don't believe casual abortion (outside of incest, rape) is okay, but I do believe regulation is needed. We've tried it when it was illegal...and women and fetuses alike were butchered.    We all will be judged according to the lives we lived; none of us will escape this.

She was very sad and sorry that she had done it, but really saw no alternative at the time.

However, there are certain cases where abortion is the lesser of two evils.   After my third, very difficult, pregnancy I was advised not to have any more children as it would be very dangerous for my health.   I took precautions by having a coil inserted but, in spite of this, I did get pregnant and had to have the pregnancy terminated because I was very ill indeed (my blood pressure was so high it was just about off the scale).  The doctors told me that I had no choice - if I did not have the termination I would die.   So it was a matter of save my life or let both of us die.  I had three other children and did not want to leave them motherless.   I was about 12 - 14 weeks gone when I had the termination and I have always wondered whether it was a boy or a girl.   There was no counselling 30 years ago so I just had to get on with it although I suffered from panic attacks, depression and anxiety for years afterwards.   My heart was damaged and I have been on treatment for hypertension ever since so I consider myself very fortunate to be still alive all these years later.    If I had the choice I would not have had a termination but I think in cases where the mother will die if the pregnancy continues then there is no choice.    I did not want to have the termination but I am glad that I was able to see my other children grow up, get married and have children of their own but I still think of the baby that I lost.

B5YsTF4iaa	The problems today are NOT worse than before. It's really crazy to see how in fear you people are. Do you realize that the Bible, the media, the government, has ways of making you fearfull? They want you to be fearful. If you are scared, you'll watch t.v, you'll buy guns and drugs, you'll develop anxiety disorders and eating disorders, you'll react. A scared society is a trusting society. They have not earned your trust, especially the bible. I can not think of one logical reason to believe anything the bible says. That is the problem, no one questions anything anymore. No one says: thats interesting and a valid claim, but what about this over here, that doesn't correlate this over there. Nope, people are too accepting of fate and reality. However, ones own perception becomes their reality. If you perceive something to be true, it IS true....to you. Recently, I've been doing a lot of reading in my business textbook and watching the news, A LOT. And I've grown to appreciate my country a lot more. Yes, we have some very shady people, and practices, but we also have science. We can cure, possibly, many many diseases, some of which were impossible to cure even 50 years ago. We are even on the brink of cureing (so long as Obama allows funding for stem cell research) cancer, alzheimers, diabetes, everything basically. Also, we are NOT in a depression because of our government. They actually realized what they did wrong last time, and put in stop-gaps to make sure it doesnt happen again, to the same degree atleast. You all are ridiculous. You're all sheep, following your master into blinding light, and right off a cliff.Sure, ignorance is bliss. But once you can see, you can never be blind again. Think about that. Hi Religious, by the way. You and I should write a book!! LOL.

This, just like with the stresses of everyday life as well as horrible problems that strike the innocent - people can look at their current problems and each one of us has a different outlook on them. I'm basically saying that every individual has a degree meter within them that deciphers how bad a problem is; what one student feels is stressful for them in psychology finals is completely the opposite to another who isn't as stressed.     The best thing for all of us to do in these times of stress - be it from environmental/situational reasons to mental reasons - is to take a breath for a moment as assess the reasons why these problems seem too be drowning us. Once you realize why, you will then be able to move onto the next step of "spiritually recovering", meaning, to overcome. You may not be able to FIX the problem, however, you will be able to manipulate your reaction to what's going on. Doing this, you'll be able to see life in a less-stressed way and see clearly.|`|9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	I'm not an "end timer" by any means, but I can offer this difference:  Over the past several decades, humans have stockpiled enough nuclear weapons to eviscerate every living organism on this planet nine times over.  Therefore, the problems today could be considered "worse" because political disputes have the very real potential consequence of nuclear holocaust which could wipe out humanity's existence.      Now, I don't believe that this will necessarily happen, and certainly not on some pre-determined date 4 years from now, but so long as those weapons exist, human extinction will continue to be a possibility.  This threat simply did not exist prior to 1945.  This makes future conflicts over continually dwindling natural resources all the more dangerous than they were in the past.|`|90c183417812d5fa5a1e44250656cf01aa	I give you this thought.

I'm closer to death in my 50's than I was in my 20's, but don't know how close.    Biblical scholars say one reason for the 'end times' is the establishment of the State of Israel, something that is predicted before the 2nd coming of Christ.     But on the other side, yes, today we know about things right away when people did not know about the wars, famines etc. in other places even a hundred years ago.    Do I believe in the 2nd Coming? Yes. Do I think we are getting closer? Yes.

AA11058044	Not only is it accepting macroevolution, the idea that "kinds" could produce the number of species we see in something like the Canids (with more than twenty distinct species of foxes alone) in less than 6000 years requires a level of evolutionary change and rapid speciation that defies even the most liberal estimates of the possibilities of genetic mutation and natural selection.    Then there comes the question of what "kind" a panda is.  Is it a bear kind?  Or a raccoon kind?  Why does the giant panda seem more bear-like, and the red panda more raccoon-like?  If there's a panda "kind", why does it share features in common with both bears and raccoons?    How about skunks, weasels, and otters?  Skunks and otters both appear to be weasel "kinds" - sharing a number of unique characters (i.e. the jaw structure of an enclosed glenoid fossa), and yet there are many different species that also count as skunk "kinds" and otter "kinds".    This attempted "explanation" used to try to cram the square peg of Bible literalism into the round hole of reality raises far more questions than it answers.|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) Is the bible consistent with the taxonomic biological classification system?    Do you mean, is the classification used by the ancient Hebrews in accordance with modern zoological classification?  Of course not.      2) Hmmm..."domain" is a new one they've added since I was in school.  Used to start with "kingdom"...      3) for the record, the terms fish and bird are designations of class    This is incorrect.  "Fish" includes a number of classes,   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish    "birds", on the other hand, are of the class "aves". - so that IS a designation "of class".      4) the term dog is a designation of a family    No, dog (in its normal usage) is a designation of **subspecies**  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog    the family "canidae", which makes up the canids, *includes* dogs, but is certainly *not* made up only of dogs.      5) so to accept that any member of either of these categories can evolve into different species within those categories, is accepting something can occur beyond what most creationists refer to as "macroevolution". is it not?    Creationists that believe in speciation?  Surely not!

The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!"

The reason it is so difficult is because these "lines drawn by man" are nothing to God. One of the earlier responders said that it is about belief in God. That is True!    I do not have a denomination, I have my Bible and the central truths in it. I do have a local church, and I am ordained in a denomination as a pastor, but I do not ascribe to anything less or more than the simple/central truths in the Word of God.    What this means is that I can feel comfortable in most denominations because I let people believe what they want, without letting it bother me too much. My aim is to Love the Lord my God with all of my heart, soul and mind, and love my neighbor as much as I care about myself (this is my own paraphrase).    When/if we get to Heaven one day, God will not seperate us by denomination, so why would he want us to seperate ourselves by denomination here?    That being said, I would suggest a small non-denominational church or a community church of some kind. I also like the Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Nazarene, Foursquare, Mennonite, Presbyterian... off the top of my head. Be careful, because every denomination has spiritually dead and damaging ministers/preachers and churches.    All the best!|`|6tszxjTVaa	If you have a bible read through the book of John.

Rather, teach him and prepare him to stand up against sin and it's temptations, as one might learn to stand against peer pressure.  What will you do when he sees other teen agers smoking cigarettes?  What will you do to keep him from reading about teen-age pregnancy in school?  You can not remove the problem, and you can not hide him from the world "You are in the world, but you are not part of the world's system".

But I'm not you.  You are a terrible bigot. The gay kid was probably bravely sticking up for himself and that's how he got into a fight. He's probably a Rosa Parks on sexual liberty.  Wait until your son manages at last to cut the ombilical cord and disappear from your pitifully ordered life. He may even turn out to be guy. It's early days yet.

You shouldn't alienate them apart.  Noone is perfect, and if you are a true Christian, you would accept Him how he is and have faith that God will direct his paths.  It is not right for you to tell your son to not be friends with him because he is gay.  Have him expelled because he is gay!!!!!!  Come on, this is absurd to me.|`|175f31c99576af42d5ff8e3e686de0eaaa	As you have noted, yes, there is a way to have the child expelled; but is that going to solve the problem? This boy, Martin, is lost in his broken lifestyle like so many of us. I used to have more problems than this boy and I wasn't expelled. I understand your concern and wish you well, but let's not lose sight of what's really happening: there is a boy your son has befriended, but has turned on him. Your son should be able to make up his own mind on how he wants to deal with this so-called friend. It is not up to you to make that decision for him.     Let your son do the right thing and get the boy out of his own life. If he still cares about Martin and wants him to see where his life is going wrong, then who better to show him the way than a believer? I'm just glad a couple of people didn't give up on me when most did!  __________    I'm sorry. I have to say this ... how sad are many answers to this question.

And that your soul ends up in New Jersey.|`|1lRlNIelaa	Ugh another "accepting" and "loving" Christian. Being gay is fine, if your son likes being with the boy let him! Geez by oppressing his emotions and feelings and natural tendency you may push him to harmful situations and psychologically traumatize him.  Having a 15 year old boy expelled just because he is gay is inhuman, racist and definitely not christian behaviour. You should be ashamed.  EDIT: Even if you have the law on your side that is only because your son and that kid attend a private, religious school so they have different rules, governed by religious rules. Inexcusable and stupid but anyway. Just because you have the law on your side that does not mean what you do is fair, or non-racist or accepting. You are simply being acting like a bigot and you are a really bad example of a mother. Not good motherly job at all.|`|f7l9byFGaa	Even if you do not agree with this kid's lifestyle, that's no reason for you to want him expelled.  He has done nothing wrong.  I thought people in this country were learning to accept people for what they are, but I guess I was wrong.  I think it is completely wrong of you to force your son not to be friends with this boy.  As parents aren't we supposed to teach our children that we should be kind to others and to accept their differences.|`|wQcYAmY5aa	ok so he chooses to be in the sin of sexual immorality, But he is no different from any one of us sinners. I dont think he should be expelled for being Gay, bc yes its a sin, but i know the other students sin aswell, we all do, everyday. Get over yourself.|`|36QnocaOaa	He should not be expelled for being who he is. Maybe you should take some time to realize what you are trying to do. Not only do you not know for sure that the boy is gay, that isn't reason to have him expelled. Maybe your son, and yourself for that matter, can learn something about different people and tolerance in the world. Your son will not be able to fire an employee or ask his boss to fire an employee because of their gender or sexual interests. This is a good lesson to learn now and should carry on for the rest of his life.    Please think before you make posts like this. It is completely ignorant and sad that this needed to be said.|`|PV2jt0u9aa	dont be so homophobic!!!! you need to understand that being gay isnt an illness, and its no different from being straight. As both a Mother and a Christain you should know the importance of being truthful to yourself in order to make yourself happy, Christianity does not preech that being gay is wrong, it preeches you to love your neighbour, no matter what!! Rather than telling your child to stay away from him, you should try telling your child to be who he is and be proud of it, it sounds to me like this gay child is setting a good example, one you should take note from. After all Christianity teaches us not to hate, this child deserves an education, and it sounds to me like you need educating yourself. I am neither gay or Christian but i do have moral values, and that is why i feel that this enables me to answer your question. Be happy, and let him be happy in who he is, the gay boy and your son.|`|YPtNr2O6aa	What a true stalwart of 'christian values' you are...i find your hypocrisy amusing, tut tut what would jesus say...|`|hkvWDU3xaa	Being the "Christianly lady that you are" Why not ask yourself , IS that What Jesus would Do?

That's not Christlike at all - Jesus wanted us to love each other regardless of any flaws we have (homosexuality included there).      That's prejudiced.  What's the harm?  Is he sexually abusing your son?  Otherwise, I see NOTHING wrong with the  boy.  This is the reason why many people end up as atheists or murderers - a lack of acceptance.|`|6YH9pjLXaa	Wow...this is the reason I believe in God but don't belong to any religions...    What happened to equality? And besides, if God truly considered homosexuality to be a sin, then why on Earth did He make this boy gay in the first place? I know for a fact that being gay is NOT a choice, it's a feeling, you just KNOW. Just like you KNOW that God exists.    I'm beginning to think that maybe you're the sinner here...accept people for who they are and don't judge; that's being a good person, not adhering to ever word in the Bible.

Are you sure you want to do that?   I don't think your a bad mother but you are an overprotective one.

Hell, they'll beat another boy up if he doesn't have a girlfriend, because they think he's 'queer', then they'll beat him up when he does, because he's going out with the best looking girl and all the others want her.|`|ZU2nlPGVaa	You spew christian values,.....you're a joke, another so called christian who is a hypocrite.

WhyWouldWe.org    Wow, it sounds like at this school love and acceptance are out the window and judgment and bigotry are in.

The only people Jesus drove from the temple were the religious leaders and money changers that were excluding others.  HMM?  Sounds like someone else needs driven out (or expelled) from this school, say perhaps, a bigoted, judgmental and hate-filled mother?  Leave the kid alone, gay or not.  Teach your kid to love his neighbors even gay ones.|`|AA12181796	You ask if you can have this boy expelled and then assert that you definitely can when people point out that "I'm a huge bigot" probably isn't going to go down too well.

So, i want to say that i think this is a little outrageous.  Why hold your son back from becoming more cultured?  This isn't a bad thing.  His friendship with a gay boy isn't bad.  This gay boy shouldn't try anything with your son--if he does, then you have a problem.    My suggestion to you is this:  open your mind.  This kid's sexuality is none of your business.    Let your son be his own person.  Just because you don't like gay people doesn't mean he can't, right?  It's just like this:  you may like tuna, and he doesn't.  Shrimp?  Peanut butter?   Orange juice?

GIRE9F45aa	They claim to be is a "religion" that helps people "know to know."  (Nice and vague, huh?)  The gist is that it's supposed to help you live a more successful life.  They believe in reincarnation, teaching that people's souls are millions of years old.  They're also violently opposed to psychiatry, viewing it as an evil conspiracy to drug people up, control them, and ruin their lives.    One of the first things members do are some very strange "communications courses," which involve forms of hypnosis and are moderately expensive.  Things get progressively more intense from there.  At the highest levels, they teach that people's problems are caused by alien parasites.  They sell courses costing thousands of dollars and are very aggressive at getting people's money.    They also have a criminal history that they don't want you to know about. They're known for strong-armed tactics against critics, and their "Operation Snow White" in the 1970's was the largest infiltration of the U.S. government in history.  It landed the wife of the founder and many other high-ranking Scientologists in federal prison.

The other woman is never going to be out of his life now that they are having a child together. You think it's bad now, just wait til the kid is here. If you do get back with him, you had better be ready to share.    He's admitted to using you for 24 years, why sign up for more abuse? This is the family model you want your children to be exposed to in their formative years? Seriously. You don't have a "lifetime together", because he was off doing his own thing behind your back the entire time. So much for together.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	Once a cheater, always a cheater.

Trust is also something that should never be truly given for nothing in return. But these are just my opinions.    Though I feel for your children as well as yourself during this time of distress, confusion, and anger, but I will say that the best option for you is to leave and divorce. This man has obviously not treated you as a husband should - you've become something of an old shirt to him; someone who he can say he's happy with, despite the holes created by his mistreatment and whatnot. You should leave.|`|aPtk8iEXaa	wow I though my ex was a shiiit head..I have two kids as well..I put up with my ex being a lying, thieving drug Addict, all while I was putting the food on the table, I caught him screwing some homeless chick in our camper one night, so I knocked on the camper he stuck his head out I clocked him upside his head, we fought...that morning Jesus told me I could now divorce him he broke our covenant...Within one week of leaving Jehovah's blessing were poured upon me and the kids...I went from making $10.00 to $17.00 a month exactly I went to $26.00 an hour I was able to keep a roof over my and my two kids heads, we never went without I always made away to provide...anyone that knows Calif knows Silicon Valley was the most outrages expensive place to live, but I did it...then 3 weeks before our company was going to file bankrupts, the man of my dreams came into my life...he took care of me and the kids no questions asked, he was and is so selfless he told me to stay home and be a mother to my kids and all he wants from me is to be there and take care of him....Pray our prayers are answered when you least expect it.

9mLjDa5kaa	Catholicism is not Christian. Here's why:     The first Christians in ACTS in the Bible were NOT CATHOLIC. They were fundamentalist in doctrine. Read Acts for yourself and see.     Catholicism didn't exist for over 300 years later.     Catholicism teaches a false gospel of works ("sacraments") that leads to eternal hell (Galatians 1:6-9). Catholicism is not Christian    Jesus wants to have a personal relationship with you. Catholicism cannot give you this.     Catholicism = faith + works = no salvation and eternal torment in hell    Christian = faith alone in Jesus for salvation, without our own works added = salvation and eternity in heaven with Jesus! :)     Only faith alone in Jesus saves! Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross and rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|0fnzDpKXaa	You are bound to get some good answers and some hateful ones.

The other core difference is about pope's authority.|`|CGr6EtRUaa	Catholics: the Head of their Church is the Pope. Salvation comes through the Clergy and Sacraments.    Protestants: If Anglican, the Head of their Church is the Queen, otherwise, whatever Elders have been elected by their congregation. Salvation comes through the individual's relationship with God: Clergy are there to lead worship and provide moral framework.    Martin Luther was denounced as a heretic because his writings sought to overturn the Hierarchy of his day. He saw the existing Church as decadent and corrupt and therefore wanted a new Church to break away. Likewise John Calvin.    Phillip of Spain was so angered by this that he sent his navy - the Armada - in 1588 to conquer Northern Europe and win back the Catholic faith. However, his squadrons were scattered in the Channel by Sir Francis Drake's fire ships, and storms did the rest.    Watch the film, 'Elizabeth - The Golden Age', if you can.|`|AA11521494	CJ is biased and totally inaccurate.    Look up the Reformation to see why and how they split apart.|`|yQNit56Qaa	Yikes!  Your initial question requires an answer that cannot be answered properly in a single volume.  It would take a mini-encyclopedia...    What you need to research is NOT the difference between the faith of the Catholics and the hugely varying differences among the faiths of the Protestants.  What you need to research is the differences between the **early** teachings of Calvinism and Lutheranism in the time of Phillip II in comparison with the Roman Catholic Church.  That will take you much, much less time than the several years the other would require.    This is pretty long, but DOES mention how Lutheranism has changed over the centuries - which is important for your essay.  You don't want to base it on *modern* Lutheran doctrine.  http://mb-soft.com/believe/text/lutheran...    This looks like a really good article on the *differences* of Calvinism with RCism  http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03198a.h...    This site also has a chronology of Lutheran doctrines  http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09458a.h...    Those last two articles should help a lot.    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...    P.S.  Luther never removed any Scriptures from his bibles - including the last one that he edited but was not published until after his death.  The omission of the Apocrypha did not *first* occur until the late 1590s - and so was not a concern of Phillip II.  However, it IS true that Luther considered them insufficient for the formation of doctrine.|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	Catholics and Protestants have different bibles, Protestants had some books removed.    Catholics observe Eucharist at every Mass where as Protestants only do so at special times of the year.    Catholics have a confessional, Protestants are not required to confess their sins (I will go further to say that SOME Protestans beleive that no matter what they do they are going to Heaven simply just for beleiving in god).    The Roman Catholic Church is headed by the Pope, he is NOT considered divine but it is beleived that divinity assists in choosing the next Pope. Protestants have organizations that head their various church but not a Pope.

AA12248887	I think it has something to do with clothing manufacturers and "standard" measurements.    Depending on which shop I buy in, the waist on my pants will be correct but the leg length will be wrong. To get the right length I'd have to buy a waist that is too big and either have the pants taken in or look wrong.    Sometimes it has to do with the washing machine. Things happen in there.    It also has something to do with how much we listened to our parents and what they taught us about buying clothes versus following "fashion trends". I remember standing on the coffee table and my mother pinning the pantleg front and back to the right drop and sewing them. Now I buy clothing off the shelf and rush around in a world of baggy bottoms and oversized tops, ripped clothing that only a few years ago would have been sneered at in any high school.    Fashion.

From the outside, you can't tell whether a couple has a good or a bad relationship. Only the people in it know for sure.    I was 32 when I met the man I would marry.

Any assertion of fact can be verified by independent sources, but personal stories can't, so you have to decide for yourself which ones you believe and which ones you don't.  If you decide that you're not going to believe any stories people recite on this forum, that would be a perfectly reasonable position for you to take.

YQOT68xFaa	Ding ding ding! Finally you hit the nail right on the head LoJ!!     The veneration of Mary - calling her the queen of heaven and praying to her and all that nonsense - it IS pagan. It is lifted directly from ancient paganism! The rituals and many teachings of the Roman Catholic Church are pagan in origin and the Church stole them and attempted to Christianize them. But they are still pagan in nature.     Yes, we should change the doctrine of Mary. She is not the mother of God. She is not sinless. She doesn't hear or answer prayers, and she isn't interceding for us in heaven. Jesus is God. Jesus is sinless. Jesus hears and answers prayers, and Jesus is interceding for us in heaven. Mary is not. Anyone who teaches this stuff about Mary is wrong, according to the Bible which says *nothing of the sort* about Mary. I'm sticking with what my Bible plainly says rather than with what some heretical "church father" said way back in the day.|`|E71jweytaa	wow dude that goes against EVERYTHING the bible teaches slick        no, no we shouldnt|`|p6wwiQG3aa	I never change anything due to pagans    However the RCC Mary doctrine is fatally flawed and should be utterly change    Good luck with that.|`|AA11058044	Or, you could do what the early church did, and co-opt the pagan beliefs.    Tell them that yes, Mother Mary is their mother goddess, and that with their pagan beliefs they've really been following a slightly off course version of Christianity all along.  If they convert completely, they won't be abandoning their religion, just learning the "truth" about what they've always believed.    Using this technique, the early church managed to steal Easter and Christmas from the pagans, co-opt many of their deities as saints, and facilitate the conversion of millions of African, South American, North American and Pacific Island tribes.|`|lTx8Hoheaa	So what if they claim Jesus is a "father God".    Do we eliminate Him, too?|`|KrTkyc9Faa	Why do you care what Pagans think? Is your faith based on their opinion? Most think Jesus was a good man and a teacher but not a god. Does that shake your faith?|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	Nope it wouldn't matter. Pagans are not subjected to specific dogmas. We are drawn to the path that we are drawn to and people can and will look at Mary as a goddess if that is what is in their hearts. Christianity is very much like Paganism, sorry to burst your bubble on that.     Oh and you have already tried real hard to downplay alot of the Mary's in Christianity, sad really....I think there are alot of truths that will be revealed about much of what has been hidden.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	You do whatever you want.    All I can say is that I am so glad I'm not one of those who will stand before Him and explain why I called His mother a 'vessel' and nothing special.|`|AA11382947	We don't change the Word of God to fit our every whim.    If they want to know the Truth about Mary, they can study her life, and the writings of the early Church.    It is arrogant to think that our job is to make the faith what WE want it to be.  We should submit to the will of God, not try to make ourselves into God, which is where you are going with this.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	Oh trust me on this: Us Pagans know that Christianity is nothing like Paganism. You can downplay whatever you want, we still won't convert.|`|AA11946554	You obviously don't understand. The 'mother goddess' is not an entity. It is an awareness of the fact that there is a divine feminine. At the tomb (in the book of Mark, I believe, only two books mention the scene and they contradict each other on who was there)...Anyway, in one version, three women are there-Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother and Elizabeth (?-Mary the mothers' sister). The three women represent the triple goddess aspect-maiden, mother, crone. God the father, Jesus the son and 'the Holy Ghost' seem to reflect this on a masculine level.  There are thousands of years and numerous religions that BELIEVE in these aspects. As an atheist, I think multiple deities would be much more likely and natural than a mono-deity. You should look into it.|`|z74a7wvlaa	As explained to you the theology of Mary being the mother of Jesus; that she is blessed from generation to generation will NOT alter one's faith;  'cus the bible [which you believe] says so.    The biblical believers' honor for Mary will not be dented by any pagan's tireless ranting of their anti-christianity campaign. Let them rant !!|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Mary is not a goddess. She is the mother of God, yet a creature like the rest of us.    As such, she is also the perfect role model for the entire Church, in that she willingly and perfectly submitted her entire life to God, with truly supernatural results.    Pagans who don't believe in the one true God aren't going ot be put off by a good woman.    As for your "vessel" idea ... when Jesus became human he raised the dignity of humankind to a whole new level. He did it for everyone, and for eternity.    Objectifying his mother, who remains the best of all non-divine humanity,  is no way to make points with God.|`|UNVJWxTmaa	You really have it backwards.  Mary is the one who would attract Pagans to Christianity.  The early Christians knew that and used it.

She figures so prominently in your own religion because you have otherwise so thoroughly expunged the feminine side of the Divine from your worship.

IMAO|`|VdifDUGkaa	a pagan wouldn't convert simply because you said Mary was not of importance in your religion. They will still see her as part of the "Christian mythology" either way. A pagan attunes with nature and visualizes whichever god or goddess is most helpful to enable them to focus their mind. Nothing you do to change your religion will affect someone who truly believes in their own, pagans or otherwise. You would be better served to learn more about the pagan's beliefs in order to understand and get along with that pagan who isn't going to convert than trying to trick them into becoming something they are not. No amount of supposedly "going to hell" talk will ever make a true pagan convert.|`|8c0d15366f972f0fe93e20c73c8bda50aa	. . . . I'm not going to say what I really want to say. I will just state the facts and leave it at that.    As a pagan myself, I see that looking at the Virgin Mary as a type of mother goddess is not bad. I simply see as it is: the Virgin Mary is many goddesses in many religions. It is simply a copy of the same aspect of the Mother Goddess. Look at Artemis - Goddess of childbirth, fertility AND virginity. Look at Isis - Goddess of Motherhood, nature, fertility AND virginity. Isis was also depicted breastfeeding her son, Horus in many sculptures - just in the same image as Mary and Jesus.    Of course in the New Testament, it states there is nothing goddess-like that is in Mary. She's simply a woman and the mother of Jesus. HOWEVER, she is looked upon by christians, catholics and pagans in a similar light - she's a pure woman, and one of great standing.    So, do change the doctrine of Mary because others - pagans - are saying she's a type of mother goddess is irrelevant - irrelavent because if you look at history, copies and copies of goddesses - and gods - have been made during the times of religious change; when new religions came to be.     I personally think that Mary is a good aspect of the goddess and I feel that there is nothing wrong with it. If pagans looked at Jesus as a god in their beliefs, would you change that as well?|`|326183ad638c65397360f6a4dcc9abfaaa	I can't speak for all pagans, but I've never heard one say that mary was a 'mother goddess.'  christianity is patriarchal religion & if there had been a way to eliminate mary all together without damaging jesus' 'credibility', church founders would have done so.|`|fxp8qIsIaa	Well lets see Jesus had a uncle Josepth of Aramis.

Let's take a look at Christian Holiday's. I have to think claiming my Christian Holiday's are Pagan is about the most corrupt propaganda yet.  Anyone that has a calender can very easy see that Christian Holiday's Parallel Jewish ones. They are aligned due to Christ Fulfillment of the prophecies. Not Pagan in origin. Unless they are willing to say Jewish Holiday's are Pagan in origin...which they aren't.    Why should we subject our beliefs to a lie?   BTW, Christians don't hold to the doctrine that Mary is a goddess. Nor is she our Savior. That is a new age concept to intentionally mock the Church. That is a sacrilege. We have but One Savior, Jesus.    Bless You|`|AcLjARwyaa	"... hencforth all generatiosn shall call me blessed."    Many have come to Our Lord through His most Blessed Mother.|`|YfwgvPaCaa	Ok, let's do some anthropological thinking here.  Historically, in the beginning of Christianity and the Church, Mary was no more than a "saint" of sorts. The idea of "saints" came from the common and current beliefs of the times with "demi gods" under the main gods of pagan beliefs. The Christian belief is "Nothing and no one is higher than God Himself and his son" but the desciples and the historical dutiful followers that preached his message until their death, were considered "Smiled upon by God and are one of the holiest men of God" and in such deserve revered respect as Gods chosen since in service of HIS son.   With the spread of the Christian religion, the conversion of the monarchy, the Church was always the "consultant" of all political and religious matters concerning the country. As the it moved west and south to well known Pagan lands, the concept of a "Goddess" and her consort "God" was the beliefs of that time. To "spread the word" and the religion (also helps to control large groups of people when all are under one religion) the concept of Mary was more predominant with those cultures with the Goddess beliefs. To use her as a conversion tool (still gave their Goddess high rank and respect but still put the God or male deity ahead) made the conversion easier. She wasn't even truly worshipped or revered until around the 11th and 12th centuries. With the mass conversions of Pagan cultures and the newly opened trade routes, Mary became a little more than the mother of Jesus or venerable saint. She is still considered as the Holy Mother and with that title she has been thought of as the male saints equal in heaven but more so. Many Southern Hemisphere cultures will pray to her for intervention with God and his son in personal matters. Just as they did prior to Christianity to their Goddess of their Pagan religion.  It has been over 600 yrs in this conversion and much of the history has been swept away, destroyed, or in sealed document halls, to keep the historical recorded changes from the public. In doing such much of it has been forgotten and common acceptance of the current belief in Christianity is common and in some peoples they believe they are born Christian.   If you will look at the historical stories of the appearance of the Virgin Mary speaking to people all over the world, many have seen her in her traditional color depiction of long robes with blue and white hues or even faded blue or brown and white. In the Mexican version of her appearance to a "Mexican/ full blooded Indian" under the direction of the current priest (remember, many of the Mexicans now have forgotten the old ways due to Spains take over), was approached by her and told Juan Diego to go to the top of the hill of Tepeyac near Mexico city, she spoke in Nauahtl tongue, pick some flowers roll them into the cloth and take it to the priest so that a church (more than likely a temple) could be built in her honor. Why would Mary want a church built in HER honor rather under her sons name or Gods? Her clothing shown in the picture from the flowers are typical native indian colors of hierarchy and priests. How could she be the Virgin Mary when in fact she wore the colors of the natives, spoke in Nahuatl, and used native plants to prover herself and want a "church" in her honor? Because she was not the Virgin but the Goddess of the local natives but some how it got turned around to benefit the Church.   Anthropologically, Mary is the Christian version of some Pagan beliefs in a Goddess rather than a supreme male God. Her popularity as a venerable hierarchy saint did not come until around the 15th century due to the new continent, lands, and island discoveries of the explorers. That is why many of us see her as the "Goddess" of Christianity rather than the Mother of Jesus. Her position has been changed from mere saint and mother to Iconic in the last 1000 yrs, when at first she was considered lesser than the deciples in the full scheme of things.|`|N9VN9bwfaa	In my humble opinion, Christianity ought to teach whatever Christians believe the truth to be.  That should not be manipulated according to what might or might not haul in some converts!  The very notion is quite monstrous, as if Christians are selling some fancy-schmancy new type of bread or a new car!    No, no, if there be parallels in belief between one faith and another, then I see it as a hint that maybe we're like the blind men feeling about on that fabled elephant and maybe we've hit upon something.  We're all blind men, you know and God is the elephant.  None of us can really tell what God is like.  He is too great for our little minds to grasp.  We can at best understand a little part.  So if we should grasp a little piece of the great whole and they should grasp another little piece of the great whole and our two little pieces should be somewhat similar, is that such a bad thing?  I think not.  It all goes to the greater glory of God in the end.

Public disclosure of private facts may also be considered  defamation, so even it were true, you could be sued or even charged criminally.    Matt 18:15-17 refers to a "brother" meaning a true brother disciple/follower of Christ. A liar is not a brother in Christ.    The Psalms and Proverbs referenced are declarations of God about how He feels about liars, but are not instructions of what we should do.    Eph 4:29 refers to gossip among the believers.    I feel we have a duty to warn our "neighbors" when there is a wolf in sheep's clothing, but doing so is fraught with risk and the "battle" over reputation may be long and bloody.  Sometimes it's better to wage small scale guerrilla attack and just let loved ones know the things you know personally, and not take out a newspaper ad on the issue.|`|cIZS6Wr2aa	I don't know if you are talking about a cult member or leader or a true Christian brother.  I'm going to presume it's the cult.  Most of the head people in these cults do what the person you speak of does?  I would pick and choose my battles and pray about them.  You may get side tracked on battling something to your left and the door to many may be shut when something going on your right may be far more important.  But if you feel strongly guided to say something, then by all means do it.  Paul would have rebuked them sharply.|`|B5Y46XBoaa	You answered your own question with scripture. Didn't you read it?     Mat 18:15-17 "If your brother sins against you, go and rebuke him in private. If he listens to you, you have won your brother. (16) But if he won't listen, take one or two more with you, so that by the testimony of two or three witnesses every fact may be established. (17) If he pays no attention to them, tell the church. But if he doesn't pay attention even to the church, let him be like an unbeliever and a tax collector to you."    It doesn't say here to run to people you believe are victims and expose your fellow Christian. It says go to him in private and try to reason with him. If he fails to repent and you are absolutely certain of what he's doing then take your evidence and talk to two others. If they agree with you, then all three of you go go back to him. If he still fails to repent then it's time to talk to the whole church, congregation, organization or group.     God gave us these instructions for a reason. Jumping the gun and running around talking to the whole group without adhering to Biblical direction in such matters will do nothing but cause chaos and you could end up doing nothing more than causing yourself to be accused of stirring up strife.|`|2f1bmHSEaa	Christians are liar's anyway hes just doing what he was taught..|`|8e35f8f7c61bfe408de6b89c171fd161aa	If a Christian is lying to gain trust and cause them to be saved?    If so, then yes expose the lie. While you would think that this would cause less faith in Christianity, if you guide them with the Bible, which is Truth Itself you will have no trouble setting them on the right path.     If it's not in regards to their salvation, then still expose the lie. A Christian who knowingly lies openly defies the commandment of God, and is sliding down a path that needs not be tread.    TO Emfederin:  I use the "IF" because the asker did not specify the lie or the situation onto which the Christian in question is applied. I can only use "IF" because the two situations that I described could be totally unrelated to the picture the asker is trying to portray.

Basically it concludes, don't.    However, out of care and concern for your fellow man, you may be able to make the truth known to the parties involved by means of presenting it publicly and yet diplomatically, without sticking you nose directly into someone else's business.    And then there is the matter of, if the liar is one you call a brother in the faith....  That can get sticky.  .

There are surgeries and procedures that can change your race, I plan to use these to correct the mistakes my former parents made.     WE ARE WHAT WE CHOOSE TO BE, HOWEVER WE ARE ALSO WHAT SOCIETY VIEWS US AS. You, like myself will not truly be happy until you have convienced everyone around you that you are 100% white, a task that can ONLY be achieved through expensive surgeries and procedureal correction.

If you have kids that are 1/4 black, they'll most likely look white, but what if they don't? What do you tell your husband and the grandparents? It's best to just be honest about yourself and your feelings.    You're not like Obama. Obama admits to being half white, he just identifies more with being black (for obvious reasons).

Should one condemn an entire "race" because of one bad person?    Do not kill all the chickens because of one bad egg!    Why do people use the word(s) "racial" and "race" only when they are referring to White and Black???    How many people actually know how many "races" there are in the world?    Why does a person who is 95% white and 5% "other" still think they are "black"??    So, if you are 1% "Black" and 99% "White" then you must be "Black", yes?  The rest of us would call you 99% White!    Is it time to run right out and get that operation to remove that tiny spot?    It would seem that you consider yourself 50% "black" as you consider that your children would be 25% "black".    Someone should have told you, if you are "white looking" then you are already 25% or less, much less!    If you actually look white then your father was probably less than 1/5th "colored".  Otherwise you really would not "look white".    I get the feeling that only "white" people consider themselves "white"??    Are Italinas white?    Are Greeks white?    Are Spanish white?    Are Albanians white?    Are southern Germans white?    Are the non-"white Russians" white?    Are the Arabs "White"?    Are the Jews "White"?    How many of us actually have a neighbor who we can say is really "White"?    Some of the few "White" people I knew in life had red hair.  Not many others!    Does anyone see my point?    Those "white" people you are talking about come from only 5% of the nations in the world, originally and genetically.    Have any of you considered that the "white races" originally came from a couple of tribes that were thrown out of India?    With regard to our President of These United States, Obama.... for whom I have the highest respect:    He does not look "Black".  He looks "Colored".  Probably a combination of African and Arabian.    I believe that if you actually had checked his genome you would find that he has around 20% to 25% Arabian heritage.

I'm not entirely certain about levitation, however, I do feel that using things of metal to heal is truly possible. I do believe, however, that not all metal object are compatible with everyone - it depends on their "aura" makeup is.    I know that I've had many experiences with metal objects - be it a dagger or, as odd as it is, a candle holder - but I've learned to trust this feeling for objects. I'm always drawn to "odd" things - rocks, gems, etc etc only because of the "feel" of them - not specifically due to their looks. This is why I don't necessarily agree with the definition of what "this gem does" as far as magic goes - I've learned that it's got to be compatible to me in order for me to understand what it does.    But as far as the feel goes, things tingle. Sometimes I hear ringing or there may be a buzz in the air.     Overall, I would say that I trust what I feel - of course looking outside in to make sure I'm not delusional.|`|Q02v1Cghaa	Sounds like your talking about Ormus, which are transition state metals in a non-metal form that is ingestible and has magical properties.

You know, like the feeling in the room when it was being used for 'magical purposes'. Like, explaining a tingling sensation when this situation happens or something.    Also, maybe the temperature of the metal when felt? Anything that you notice or might think about when touching something would be a good idea.|`|uXro6Us1aa	Are you speaking of Alchemy ? If so..the metal substance-is only a metaphor for life, as in finding your inner spiritual healing powers-turning your silver into gold ? Just means to be the best & make yourself most knowledgable to help others.. Everyone has potential to do something. Some people intriuged by such things as you send out to the universe to question means you probably have a healing spiritual soul & need to educate yourself on how you can heal others, as far as all the different ways, spirtually, medically, physically, etc.. As far as your question, one would need to know more info than just what you have here in your question to be able to know what your mean.
xopIi2Vfaa	depends on the nature of your problems. You will have to solve them, and every problem might need a different strategy to solve it and also some patience. E.g. if you have problems with grades, talk to your teacher for suggestions how to improve grades and follow suggestions. If you just have a too high workload, and you have optional classes, explain to instructor and ask if you can drop a class or an activity.    If you have a high stress level, some physical activity, whether it's playing basket ball or going running can help you to get calmer.

e3PWZYsAaa	Salam,    you see, have you heard of the whole 72 virgin in heaven thingy?    well, i've heard about that, BUT only by non-muslims, and i have absolutely no idea where it came from, and surly it is NOT in Islam.....      iot's basically the same thing....  .....for some reason, some people say, Shias believe the Holy Quran is croupted (which we don't), Shias believe the angel Gabril should had given the prophet hood to Ali (as), but instead he gave it to Mohammad (PBUH) (which we don't), Shisa believe...., Shias believe......    and it's funny, cus although i'm a Shia, i've only heard these false claims and lies from non-Shias/Shia haters.      i mean if it was a Shia thing, i would had known about it, right?  but it's funny how i've never heard a Shia say that, and i've only heard it of Shia haters...  yep, it's like the whole 72 virgin thingy....  ....made by the haters of Islam          Shias do NOT believe the Holy Quran is croupted  shias do NOT believe Ali (as) should had been the prophet.  and etc etc etc.        logic is not a bad thing....|`|mOWyzwubaa	unless a person believes in sunni hadith books one can NOT become a muslim,even Belief and following Glorious Quran alone is NOT suffiecient to become a Muslim.

Do You believe the Angles made a big mistake?|`|vMAEeh66aa	Because the shia Hate who hated Ahlul Bayt and love who loved Ahlul Bait .    But the Sunna love everyone , until they are out of the bounds of logic|`|FB2YS9fjaa	well the majority of Muslim Sunnis are unity pigs so IMO Shia'a are Muslims too since they are more pigy than Sunnis    Of course I am talking about ur Islam here cause I am Kaffir Wahhabii|`|hWo22bJ0aa	Because Shi'as don't sit on the fence trying to defend those who hurt and killed the Ahl al Bayt. It's one or the other. The Shi'as choose the Ahl al Bayt.    @ fair- The Shi'a concept of Imamat does not contradict the fact that there are no more prophets. Imams are not Prophets. Muhammad (saw) was the last and final prophet. As you just said, it's Khatme NUBUWWAT, not khatme imamat.      @ fair- i am thinking cool mindedly :)  Right. Well, since i am a Shi'a, i would have thought that *I* would know my own beliefs better. So, as shocking as you might find it: I don't believe that Imams are given higher ranks than the prophet.    And about the "supernatural hearing" they have- you can ask that to yourself. We (muslims) send our salaams to the Prophet ans his progeny every time we pray, and it's wajib for someone to reply to a salaam. So, why do we send them salaam if they can't hear us?    EDIT- I'm merely stating my beliefs. If you don't want to believe me, then don't, and stop wasting your own time. I think i know my beliefs better than you do. And i'd appreciate if you could respond to my above point about sending salaams to the Prophet (saw) and his progeny (as). You still haven't answered my question. WHY do we send salaams if they can't hear us? It's wajib for them to answer, and yet you say that they can't hear us.    You know what? I give up with you. If i explained a million times, provided a million proofs, you'd never understand because you don't WANT to understand.c|`|y7UmWr4raa	I dont call any specific shia as a kafir .    but i do point out the shirk and kufr in their books and practice ,    first of all, the main thing is their concept of Imamat Which is clearly oposite and contradict to muslims's and quranic concept of khatme nabuwwat .    Thats right that they dont say that their r prophets after Mohammad (saw),but they do say that their r twelve Imams who r     Infallible and apointed by Allh ,  Know the unseen ,have knwledge of past and future.  higher rank than prophets     Can help supernaturally ,can hear from far and near.    and many more worse than these .    So they have just gave different name other than prophet but Assign attribute of prophets and even attribute of Allah (swt)  They slander ,abuse and accuse sahabah and Ahl bayt     Their books r the witness of all these ,even they deny .    @ zaru ! my dear friend! think cool mindedly ,i have explained in my answe that u guys give different name but assign attribute of prophets to your Imam ,So in a way they r also prophets.    @ zaru ! dont deny the facts that shias give imam the higher rank ,ur books ur scholars like Ayatullah khomani ;s books r witness    @ sending salam doesnt mean that they hear us,if that is the   case,then we should believe all ibad ul saliheen hear our salam,( which is obviously wrong)bcoz we also send salam to all saliheen.    So can u believe that all saliheen can hear us ?    obviously u will say  NO !|`|JNr86XAVaa	There is one named k is a Wahhabi syatan.Believe in Quran but not hadith|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	Didn't I say move on forward?

Jon M has a good one, though. The best answer I know of is a bit more complicated.    Why did God make humans? According to Genesis, God had already made angels who at once have the advantage of seeing God's true glory, but like Lucifer also have the resentment of being God's slave. Angels never chose to worship God, they were compelled to. On the flip-side, God made the animals, which though they are perfect beings, are creatures of instinct and completely oblivious to the concept of God.    Humans were created as God's grandest experiment, the only creation with the choice of knowing and doing God's will. If God's existence was as plainly obvious as the sky is blue, your free will would completely disappear. It's a bit like the wealthy person who feigns poverty to see who his/her friends really are.    I know I haven't done the best job of articulating this idea, but it's hard to be concise with an idea that has as many ramifications as this one. If we could all hear God's voice, the world as we know it would cease to exist, but beyond that, there'd be no reason for this world to exist at all.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	It goes against two things that we do know FROM HIS VOICE.    1) That He has given us all we need to know in Jesus.  See below, St John of the Cross.     2) We are not only not to think that God would have something more to say, we are warned against desiring revelations out of pride.    See below, St John of the Cross.       And I know from experience what you are thinking right now. "This contradicts what the Jews thought about prophecy" But it doesn't :  Deuteronomy 29:29 The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.      ===========================  St JOHN OF THE CROSS  But a voice came from the cloud above: "This is my Son, the Beloved. Listen to him." (Mt 17:5; Mk 9:7)  St John of the Cross said that God was more or less saying: "If I have already told you all things in my Word, my Son, and if I have no other word, what answer or revelation can I now make that would surpass this? Fasten your eyes on him alone because in him I have spoken and revealed all and in him you will discover even more than you ask for and desire  I have already spoken, answered, manifested, and revealed to you by giving him to you as a brother, companion, master, ransom, and reward ...If I spoke before [through priests and prophets in the Old Testament] it was to promise Christ ... [But if people asked God to speak to them now or ask for visions] they would offend my beloved Son deeply because they would be obliging him to become incarnate and undergo his life and death again.  You will not find anything to ask or desire of me through revelations and visions.  Behold him well, for in him you will uncover all of these already made and given, and many more  My Apostle proclaimed this in writing to the Colossians: In the Son of God are hidden all the treasures of the wisdom and knowledge of God (Col 2:3)."     St John of the Cross concludes: "Anyone wanting to get something in a supernatural way would, as it were, be accusing God of not having given us in his Son all that is required. (The Ascent of Mt Carmel, Bk 2, ch. 22.)    ======================================...|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Because that would require actual existence.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	He has done that already and in the written word also.....seek Him to find Him....when willing pray for His spirit...|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	He does.

8rbQBaIeaa	Christianity does not mean you become a pansy. I think the bible is also to teach us that there is more ways than one to give and do for others. We give of ourselves. Go to the sick and visit. Take a small amount of food to a needy family. Give of your time to those that are in need. When people come to you for a handout, let them know where the nearest help center is. Give the phone number or address. The bible does not mean give your last dime. That's what you are doing...going broke. Are they coming out of the woodwork or now that you are a Christian peoples needs are more noticable to you? I have called some's bluff before. When they ask for food, I say let's go in the store and I have enough to buy a loaf of bread, but that's all I have I can give. If they are serious they say yes thank you. If they are not...they leave. At times I say I'm sorry, I don't have any extra cash right now, but I do know the phone number to the nearest help center who will be able to guide you in the right directions for your needs. Money isn't everything. Your time counts too. Good Luck....either way, you have to tell people no...why not be Christlike instead of hateful.

First, Matthew 10:16  "I am sending you forth as sheep amidst wolves; therefore prove yourselves cautious as serpents and yet innocent as doves".  Jesus is aware of your situation and does not want you to suffer.  He knows there are lots of 'wolves' out there and is telling you to be cautious.  Don't be cautious in a bitter way, being hurtful. Stay innocent as a dove, but don't be gullible.  How does one do this practically?  2 Thessalonians 3:10 "If anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat."  When someone asks you for a free handout (or service) ask them what they have already done, on their own innitiative, to get done what is needed.  If you sense the answer is 'nothing' .....be cautious.  Run, do not walk!

I can't entirely say if it's true because my palm never itches when I'm expecting my paycheck.  I've also heard that when your nose itches it means someone is coming to visit you. Whether it's a good someone or a bad someone is not really determined.  When your ear itches, that's supposed to mean someone is talking about you at that precise moment.  Supposedly these are physical symptoms of precognition. For some people it rings a great deal of truth, others are skeptical, and than there are the non-believers.  However, I haven't really heard a reason for what causes people to scratch their butts. T be particularly honest on that one; I don't want to know.

I always feel someone touch my arm or shoulder at my house or at my friends house. Or I feel the bed sink down as if someone just sat down !

Call TAPS - Ghost hunters !! :)|`|8k6kxOh2aa	it could be a poltergeist, or it could be some sort of demon. poltergeists are for the most part playful spirits, and they may not realize that they are actually hurting you. maybe you could talk and ask it not to hurt you anymore when you go there next. i did this one time to a spirit that was bothering me, and it stopped doing what it was doing.   there is a chance it could be a demon, but i believe it is more likely a poltergeist that is just playing around with you. maybe it's your uncle and it's his way of making sure you don't forget him. i don't know for sure though. i would have had to see how the being behaved myself.  ~stardriven09|`|oJTxk2cDaa	It sounds to me as if there is a supernatural force present, but why or what it is is only manifesting it's self to you.|`|wMunBQ9Oaa	Helll nawww!

GHdscZ2Haa	Weigh?  As on a scale?  No.   When you breathe in your body will expand and so you will displace more of the air around you.  The two will balance.      You will have greater mass by the mass of a few hundred ccs to a couple of liters of air. Depending on how deeply you breathe.      You do not say what you are comparing this to. You will weigh less than if your lungs were full of a denser material, like water. (If you are standing in air.)    If you are standing in a vacuum, then, spiritually speaking, yes.|`|JqHkgWROaa	Does a person weigh less with lungs full of helium?|`|vxSXsn59aa	Yes, air has weight.|`|qbelhflAaa	LOL.|`|5cd72c27261c5c994c0b5c7e6eed47dfaa	Yes, but the change in weight difference would be almost imperceptible.|`|uu2MV1KSaa	yeah. though it's relative to the median you are in at the time (consider a vacuum, normal atmosphere, underwater, etc).|`|AA11620976	Yes But their  density would decrease >M/V=D  Depending upon the temp and percentage of water vapor , air weighs approx 1.25gm/l  Find the volume of the lungs and do the math|`|eloWO2piaa	Actually, no. When we breathe in air, our body becomes lighter|`|FjhGxAOoaa	Nahhh.      The holy spirit lifts them up just a little to offset that extra mass.      ITS A MIRACLE!!!!!    PRAISE JEEBUS!!!!!!!|`|Q4MqzxX7aa	technically yes, air does have a weight but very minute|`|olpJSiJaaa	All substance has weight, including gasses and oxygen.  The reason that balloons go up is because helium is lighter than the air on the ground.  Same with hot air.  But yes, with air in your lungs you are slightly heavier, but the difference in weight is negligable.      FS has a good point.  It depends what medium your in.

O1xSW736aa	You really need an education.    Methane CH4, Propane C3H8, and octane CH 3 (CH 2) 6 CH 3 are all organic chemicals.  Organic chemistry is a discipline within chemistry which involves the scientific study of the structure, properties, composition, reactions, and preparation (by synthesis or by other means) of chemical compounds that contain carbon.     Evolution is the process by which the earliest forms of life and all their descendants became more complex through variation and natural selection.  It doesn't explain how life came about.    Nobody actually knows exactly how life first came about and there is no shame in admiting that.  However, I think you will find towards the end of "The Ancestors Tale" Richard Dawkins does have a hypothesis on how life first came about.    If you don't believe life magically came from carbon atoms, why do you think its reasonable to believe it came from a magical invisible being blowing into some dust?|`|5f80f1f151b797b394930ab7261f6128aa	You're an idiot!  I just can't think of anything else to say about your "question."  And Richard Dawkins never said any such thing!  You are not only an idiot, but a liar as well!|`|WX1b747Iaa	Ahem, there's a very simple definition of 'organic' in chemistry, it means containing carbon atoms. You are an educated and subtle troll, why you want to muddy the waters I have no idea.|`|QC94lBXOaa	" I don't know" does not equal "Godidit"|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Yes, but so what. You are so silly. If one man claims not to know all of the answers, you consider that everything that he says is false and thus your magical fairy is somehow real. With thinking like this, it is no wonder that you believe in invisible magical fairies.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	There's a great deal of methane coming from your question.|`|urIm4YaBaa	I don't know how electricity works in my house. Should I therefore assume that the lights turn out at the flip of a switch by magical means?    Not having an answer yet doesn't mean that magic is the answer. It means more research needs to be done. Work is being done on these fronts.    The day that you hear that scientists say, "We're done," the day that they close the doors and start training for new careers, is the day that you can try to enlarge any holes in science large enough to discredit naturalistic prophecies. But that day isn't today, and it doesn't look like it's coming anytime soon.|`|zkETPA8waa	I'm calling troll, because I don't think anyone is quite this stupid.|`|5cd72c27261c5c994c0b5c7e6eed47dfaa	Organic and life are different things. I would try to explain it to you, but it would be no use. You either wrote this drunk, or worse, you wrote this sober.|`|AA10067344	I could not care less about what Richard Dawkins has to say.  You're right though, I don't think magic can account for how life came from carbon.    Yes, methane, propane and octane are all organic.  Take a chemistry course.|`|thVN9X2Baa	skipped a few science classes didn't you|`|YYsldZcYaa	Richard Dawkins is not the king of evolution.  Evolution makes no claim on how life began.  We have multiple hypotheses as to how abiogenesis could have happened.  There is no evidence to support a supernatural origin story...      Sorry...  this question is a bit of a mess.  You should try reading things and bringing us something that makes sense.|`|IQIMyE5Naa	You show your bias when you say "EVILution."  This implies you aren't willing to research facts, therefore, your opinion is hard to take seriously.|`|KrTkyc9Faa	Ok then, explain HOW god created the earth...    If you don't know, does that mean the earth doesn't exist?|`|AA11521494	TROLL.  Your second statement does not logically follow from the first.|`|UL6FcEliaa	Did you notice that you are attacking people for their honesty?|`|uu2MV1KSaa	sources first.  and using the word 'magically' is a bad idea, considering the alternative idea about creation...|`|v80N4JB0aa	christians admit the same thing, so what is the point|`|KJHt4hiYaa	Your conclusion about evolution can't logically be made from your opening premise. Evolution is about the origin of species not the origin of life.|`|JXLiZEb2aa	Go back under your bridge, Mr. Troll.|`|ycaloVnkaa	Well rather than look into it lets just not use the brain that GOD apparently gave us and lets just put it down to "bcuz the bible says it".|`|5163421430fada657d83a91148b438e2aa	I listen to God not man anyway, but thanks|`|fb5e6abe0d15467cb8e98fd9cd776d9daa	The only thing accurate about that is the last three words.|`|YPtNr2O6aa	You are such an idiot that it physically hurts me. This just goes to show that your average creationist has a head consisting entirely of bone.    Evolution has NOTHING to do with the origins of life - evolution only has any effect when life already exists. ABIOGENESIS is the theory of how life emerged and since this is a scientific theory, scientists do have some idea of the processes involved in the emergence of life. And contrary to your simple-minded belief that the theory consists of life being created by 'magic' (which, is infact the belief of creationists), abiogenesis is a highly complex and lengthy theory that your religion-addled mind is quite incapable of understanding.|`|KAVU8SQ0aa	Well, aren't you a frigging genius, running your little mouth off about something that's common knowledge as if it's a great secret.    You're wrong when you say they have no idea how life started, though.  They have ideas that are being tested and yielding interesting results, tho' at this time there is no working theory of abiogenesis.    Evolution, however, is sorted.|`|RedEGIfZaa	Sorry, but that's wrong.    We do not know for certain all the details about how life originated, but we have a *very* good idea about the basic process of abiogenesis.|`|AaKZekyRaa	First, we've all stated quite often that we don't know exactly how life arose. This is nothing new.    Second, evolution doesn't address the question of how life arose so your conclusion that it's false is a FAIL.    Third, methane, propane and octane are organic molecules. That's why we study them in Organic Chemistry. They aren't living but they are organic.    Please try harder.|`|YFmoMIMbaa	Richard Dawkins is a scientologist. Read his book, and discover this fact for yourself...    And you're correct. Abiogenesis is very, very laughable. What's more real? Primordial soup? Or kryptonite?    There is the same amount of evidence for both...    Hypocritical, isn't it?

Black peoples skin is able to handle heat better than white people, I could sit in the sun all day and never have to use sun screen, white people will blister and burn because they aren't eqquipped to handle the sun.  Humans adapt to their envirnment just like any other animal.  You hardly ever see any pure africans with facial or body hair because they don't need it because they are in a warm enviornment while if you go to the cold parts of Europe you will find whites are able to grow hair all over thie bodies....Has anyone ever seen an African with hair on his/her back?
SF1uPJZhaa	Egypt is too hot for her. = ?gypten ist zu hei? fr sie. / ?gypten ist ihr zu hei?.  ?, not ss. Despite the spelling reform you still put an ? after a diphtong.

As older and wiser Souls are now coming to Earth, so they are simply KNOWING within that what they are told is NOT the real truth!..That goes for some of what they are taught in school also, for MUCH is hidden from us, and humans are very special and powerful..    Ive been privileged to have had many experiences with Angels and through them, with He/She which is known as God, not so much a Being, but more of the Universal Loving Creative Energy of which everything and everyone is a part, including you and I..God IS His/Her Creation and is not separate from it!..Hence God is sometimes called All That Is..    So, what is my impression about God?..Well, it is simply TOTAL LOVE, no more and no less!..God DOESNT judge, DOESNT threaten, DOESNT condemn and DOESNT send us to a fictitious *hell*..No one judges us but US when we arrive at the point of total self honesty!..    Would any loving parent judge, threaten and condemn their offspring to eternal suffering?..Well then, how in Heaven*s name could God, whose Love for Hir Children is without limit or conditions, do that?    God gave us a brain and discernment so that we could SENSE and feel the truth behind what is spoken and what is read..

Second, we don't reject the idea of life on other planets because we know life exists.    Third, we *do* reject the idea of God because there is no evidence that God exists.|`|4LYasBGXaa	because there is no proof to substantiate that god exists- beyond that it is illogical.    while the alien idea is in fact at this point just conjecture, it is of slightly more legitimacy than the god hypothesis since it is not inconceivable that the same reaction that created life on earth, created life elsewhere as well.    it is not logical to believe taht such life will be like it is portrayed in the movies-  green, blue and red women getting boned by an actor who overacts and looks funny in tights hanging out with a legend of zelda reject who tries to sing the blues.    the concept of an intelligent creator that wants people to act a certain way and supposedly takes an interest in people's lives yet has never once appeared to make his/her/its/thier presence known in the hundreds of thousands of years humans have existed adds to the lunacy of the philisophical argument for the existance of an invisible sky fairy.    the concept of a "deist" philosophy or belief system is less problematic but no less illogical unless you change the definition of god.    as we discover more and more about the universe, this god becomes responsible for "less and less" leaving the deistic argument- which claims god is only responsible for the event that created the universe the only one that will not be blown out of the water until of course we actually find what did cause the big bang.|`|MUcINsQ3aa	I reject mans definition of God|`|AA11521494	I HAVE rejected him rather than dismissed him without thought, and that's simply because I couldn't "believe" any longer in a god who clearly doesn't exist, or if he does, is a vindictive mental sadist wanting us to be obsessed with sin and how to avoid it.  He never answered prayer, I never for one moment felt he was there, and my life carries on just the same without him.  The whole salvation thing makes no logical sense whatsoever - the more I thought about it, the less sense it made.  Most Christians seem to see their faith as a crutch to lean on rather than actually thinking through exactly what it says.    That probably sounds harsh but those are my thoughts, and I needed to write that to provide my proper answer to the question.|`|AA12181796	Why should we jump to the completely unfounded conclusion that "God did it!" just because we can't answer certain questions yet?

If those seem like silly questions, then what evidence do you have for God beyond what we have for Santa?|`|6YH9pjLXaa	1) Because of the way they were brought up;    2) Because they don't believe that, what with all the horror and destruction in the world today, that any kind of divine being could exist;    3) Because they were taught about Christianity and the Bible at school and think that God seemed extremely unfair and unjust as he is depicted there;    4) Because they don't agree with the Bible;    5) Because they are close-minded;    6) It's just something they don't believe in - they never have, and never will;    7) Because they find it difficult to accept the fact that some divine voice shouted instructions to Moses from the sky thousands of years ago and the only so-called record of this happening is a book that was written thousands of years ago and that's probably changed hundreds of times over the years;    8) They do believe in God, but they don't believe that He is as He is the Bible - they believe that if He created the world and continues to watch over it, it'd be a little odd if He sent everyone who didn't believe in him or who wasn't Christian to hell...    ^ I'm with number 8.

FEATHERS is PIUME / pronounciation- Pee.oo.me ("me" sounds like MEtal ^_^)  concerned as the softest part of the birds' plumage...the ones used to write too....

EMhWXqbnaa	I'm sure you meant the difference between "kein" and "nicht". =)  "klein" is just "little", while "nicht" is "not", so the difference is quite clear.    "Kein" means "no" in the sense of "none", while "nicht" means "not".    - Ich spreche kein Englisch. = I speak no English.  - Ich spreche nicht Englisch. = I don't speak English.  The first one sounds better, but the second version is not wrong, though. That's because the second one is not that clear - "ich spreche kein Englisch" leaves no doubt you just don't know the language, but "ich spreche nicht Englisch" could, depending on the context, also mean that you don't *want* to do so, but you'd be able to.    In other cases, both can be used and express the same thing.  - Ich habe keinen Sekt bestellt, sondern Wein. = I didn't order (any) Champagne: I ordered wine!  - Ich habe nicht Sekt bestellt, sondern Wein. = I didn't order (any) Champagne: I ordered wine!  Both are absolutely correct, if you are a native speaker or really advanced in German, you may use them in different ways, but I think it's not necessary to tell you that yet, I'm not even sure if everyone interpretates it in that way. ;-)    In this sentence ...  - Ich habe keine Zeit! = I don't have time!   ... you can't use "nicht", because you don't have *any*!    And in this one ...  - Ich kann nicht kommen! = I can't come!  ... it's impossible to use "keine" because that would mean "none" and doesn't make sense here.    You use "kein" in front of nouns; "nicht" in front of verbs.|`|mUK240ykaa	"Nicht" is an _adverb_ meaning 'not', while "kein" is an _article_ meaning 'no', 'not a', 'not an', and an _adjective_ meaning 'none' :     "Sie kommt nicht."    "Das ist kein Bett."  That is not a bed.     "Wie viel gibt es? - Kein."  How much is there? - None.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Klein means small, and nicht means not.  Very simple, actually.|`|gBjhdQF5aa	nicht means "not", and klein means small, not "not"; when you want to say "not", you use "nicht"    Example : I am not happy = ich bin nicht zufrieden|`|AA10982716	Nicht means not, klein means small.  Pretty sure you're asking about kein, which means no, in the sense of not any.    Use nicht when you're negating the verb or adjective. Use kein when you're negating a noun.    Ich spreche nicht Deutsch. = I don't speak German.  Ich spreche kein Deutsch. = I speak no German.    Usually use "kein" with "sein" and "haben", and "nicht" with other verbs'---but not always.|`|319e4c1fe311011f6d90cd2896a7ba84aa	I think you meant "Kein" not " klein"    Nicht ...means NOT  Kein... means  NONE  Klein...means  LITTLE|`|GkO45d7uaa	Klein means small, but I think you mean "kein."     Ich habe keine Problem mit ihm. (I have no problem with him).    Ich bin nicht froh. (I am not happy).|`|2I4Tcrfsaa	Nicht means 'not'  but klein means 'little'.    http://www.wordreference.com/deen/klein|`|kyUiaDgyaa	klein translated means "Small'' and nicht translated means not|`|RDWzGxb7aa	just in case you meant to type kein and not klein, kein means no. I am not happy translates as Ich bin nicht lusitg. To say lazy you can say Faupelz, which translates as fur coat, this is a noun, if you say I am not lazy, you say Ich bin kein Faupelz

Wearing a shirt advertising your favorite football team vs. another is alright. People do that all the time.

Please don't.|`|9kRFGagaaa	Well i do think that example is funny, though i would not wear it because it might offend somebody. But it all depends on the message on the shirt, on how controversial it is. I would wear a shirt that said    I'M NOT RACIST  I HAVE COLOR TV!    its something everyone can laugh at. but taking a person that is in the public eye, and subjecting them to racial shirts, i think is immature.|`|5jtKgw6Iaa	I got a shirt from my sis once saying " There is an asshoe lookin at me ( in the front ) still looking at me ( in the back ).. it was funny the first time i wear it.. but then after that is juz kind rude so i stop wearing it hahhaa|`|hkQSqPEwaa	yes.

3RYqo9dJaa	Well, there are reverse Christians who revere Satan as an incarnate of evil, and there are the other theistic satanists. From what I understand, the other theistic Satanists believe Christians are misguided, and that god tricked everyone and is in fact evil, while the devil is in fact good. It's still very odd in my eyes.    Though most satanists are LaVeyan and thus atheistic or agnostic.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	Yahweh's really horrible to everyone, and he doesn't even offer a good time.

Well, not exactly the same, but we have our reasons  as to why.   How do you know Satan is evil? From what you were told about  him, read about, have you ever talked to him or met him?  That's like someone saying things about you or read about you  and saying you were evil. And should be known as that way.  Would you like them to believe that? They have to met you in  person and see how your like or have talked with you. Satan is   not like that, evil.  Everyone have there own religious beliefs so don't judge.|`|tqaLQe86aa	Satan and the Demons are the original Pagan God/esses of humanity. The point of Theistic Satanism is the honor and worship of Ea(Satan) and the Eldar God/esses. Who are real and living beings.    The highest goal of Spiritual Satanism is the locus meaning of all Pagan religions where about the science behind the stories.    Spiritual and Physical perfection. The personal Godhead, where physical immortality is obtained and you have full use of all the powers.    Ea(Satan) and the Eldar God/esses(Demons) where wworshipedand loved for thousands of years and it took massive cultural and physical genocide and the rewriting of history to force people to fear what their ancestors loved.    We know this Beings as real and have a two way relationship with them. They are very friendly and helpful and bless their followers and the friends and family members of their followers.    Once you experience the love of Ea(Satan) and the other Eldar God/esses. You will realize the point fully. And will never want to turn back. But go onwards to the Godhead.|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	It's for nerdy teenagers to feel empowered, and shock their friends and family.  Nothing more.

Most of them are some of the most ethical people I know, and that counts for a lot in my book.    Mind you, I don't understand them...but a former atheist I live with pointed out that maybe you (atheists, I mean) don't NEED to acknowledge any deity to fit into your place the world.  And that actually makes a lot of sense to me.|`|1bd7361886f753dc29575d47b7fb14d0aa	Doesn't matter what you are, if you want eternal life you need Christ, not religion or anything else. "He who has the Son has life, he who has not the Son has not life and this life is in His Son" (John). We can say or do what ever but if we haven't accepted God's gift (His Son) then we have only what the world has to offer and that is for a very short time when compared to eternity. Without Christ you have absolutely not hope.|`|eoOmeeJoaa	Live and let live.  As long as they don't try to foist their religious views on me or try to convert me, we're just fine.   We all (except atheists) worship a higher power, we just call him (her?) by different name and practise our religions in different ways.

Most Christians forget to let love be their motivation and that is what gives the few who do such a bad name.  Most (but not all) other religions will be much more tolerant of such stances.|`|TnPiiwoAaa	Good question|`|EAuMJrs4aa	good on you "Di M" wish everyone thought that way it would be a utopian society|`|Z4avhg3eaa	I don't have a problem with atheists.  In fact, many people mistakenly think I'm an atheist!|`|kkSyz6aoaa	Were their only Threat, why should they persecute others?|`|iqWfufpUaa	They are hot, funny, sexy and intelligent.   And they can go on for hours......|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	Christians have a doctrine of spreading the word and assume every other religion is inferior so they need converting. that's the only aspect of Christianity that rubs me the wrong way. well the way some Christians behave but that's a case by case thing.|`|RrnMRJ2Laa	I believe that every man is my brother.  No matter the colour of skin skin,   his faults, his mistakes,  and what people say and think about him.  I believe that within the heart of every man,  There s always a seed of goodness,  that I must uncover, accept,   approciate and value.  I believe that in life,  is more important to be than to have.  I do not believe that the goodness die, when the body dies  but it lives on, and changes men, and the world|`|LhDde5iBaa	Christians think every other religion is blatantly false and leads straight to hell.|`|Uz1RzHzlaa	I think that they should learn about the love of God, and the truth that Jesus is the savior.|`|czf6uhIraa	Yeah, we're thinking of you guys too!  ;)      *mumbles darkly...*
U6U1hPHcaa	Yes they can by sleeping on the beach for many days and giving the sun a chance to burn them ..|`|AA10067344	It's not really bleaching, but white people do get spray-on tans.|`|e4aF8tdPaa	i mean isn't that what tanning does? and i don't know why some black people bleach their skin anyways. i think that's dangerous|`|HP1pToMOaa	Bleach makes stuff lighter, there is no way it can make skin darker. It's not a dye.|`|6ypnDnvLaa	lol, "Woolite Dark".  Ahem, but seriously...  I think the only way is to stain your skin,   like a tattoo.|`|MTdMCfmlaa	No, it's impossible to bleach ones skin to be darker.|`|l9ab36z4aa	when you bleach something you are making it lighter. White people get fake tan|`|a51c5d63421f6dad3ffde92ca2b05f4daa	lmao no you can;t BLEACH white skin to be darker, surely it'll get whiter...|`|FknQXMzRaa	well that's kind of silly    Why would you want to do that ?|`|d3N60SuSaa	No you have to tan to get darker or get an artificial tan.|`|jgpYS0oEaa	I don't think it'd be called "bleaching their skin to be darker" probably called tanning lotions and other stuff. I don't see the problem if you like lighter skin because it's your preference. It seems dark people are frowned upon for wanting lighter skin...but no one says anything about girls wanting a tan (besides it being unhealthy). But I do think its a prob. when you're hating your race and trying to change it.|`|LfsBTCk2aa	I used to go to tanning beds when i was younger and stopped 8 years ago... i never got back to my natural color, (yes the tan did fade, but not to how light i am naturally), my dermatologist said the tanning changed my skins pigmentation  so yes i guess in some cases you can get permanently darker
zQyslfHKaa	Is 'the Devil' street slang for menstruation cycle?|`|1lRlNIelaa	If he walks besides her and is in her then she's lying 'cause he isn't omnipresent! lol  Actually you can understand he's coming if you smell sulfur and see something of fiery red. lol again  Seriously your friend is lying in order to gain attention. Devil is imaginary.|`|5163421430fada657d83a91148b438e2aa	You know|`|Vssz80rcaa	You will know that the devil is present, but you will never know when he is "near." There is a difference. and the devil can take over someone, but the devil is not god, he does not walk with you and live inside of you, he is not omipresent!!! you can however be taken over by demonic spirits and maybe thats what your friend means..|`|KrTkyc9Faa	A Christian will also be near...|`|1WisnX8naa	By the smell of BBQ on his breath...
ybn6beqiaa	Awww! (just for the record, its my birthday in a week and 4 days and I HATE birthdays)  Anyway, its your 18th! Are you planning to go out? Want to go out with me?? We could go to a bar and just get completely wasted lol.   If you dont feel excited, then you dont feel excited.. Its not your fault, you should never fake being excited. Your day will get better!  *biig happy birthday hugs whilst giving you a present ^.^*|`|yzgS5KiQaa	Yeah. Birthdays are weird. I guess it's because your supposed to feel a year older, but you don't grow a year in one day LOL. Like right now I'm 19 years, some odd months old, I'm closer to 20 than to 19. I dislike birthdays, they get in the way of my plan to be a kid forever. But I look the same age, so I guess I shouldn't complain LOL. Tranny boys have a way of doing that.|`|IFs6MWDJaa	Meh i was not that exited when i turned 18, i mean i liked my birthday cuz i spent it with friends and that was fun and all. but i was no more exited about turning 18 then i was about turning any other age|`|pXVdEZCNaa	lol yeah dont worry i wasnt really exited either|`|Fy9Muy6Waa	Well Happy Birthday Apple Picking!    I wasn't all excited about my 18th either. I think that the only reason people get excited about birthdays is because they have something special planned, or it is the age at which they can do something they had wanted to do, or because it's important to them personally for some reason or another. I think your feelings are normal. :-)|`|Oll0CHkbaa	Pretty normal, yeah. 18 doesn't really let you do much other than have to provide for yourself in a situation where your parents would have before. It's more of a burden of becoming an adult than actually a liberating age, unless you've been suffering under the restrictions of a legal guardian you no longer want to associate with.|`|n0WyMoX5aa	yeah.... thats how i was i was suposed to go get my I.D and then go buy cigarettes but it never happend and now ive been 18 for 6 months and still dont have I.D|`|aI2S6gCGaa	ya it is and i hate being 18 because i want to be a kid forever|`|61c8oevtaa	Happy birthday!    I was 18 on January 1st. Normally I would have been out the night before and my birthday's always a bit rubbish because I'm tired/hungover.    But this year I was in hospital over Christmas and I was still really ill over New Year. My parents and my sister went to Italy to see my relatives (yes, over my 18th birthday!) and I had to stay at my aunt and uncle's house because I was too ill to travel. That was a rubbish birthday.     I went out a couple of weeks after to celebrate properly though.    =]    Edit: Are you in the USA? 18's extra special for us in the UK because we can drink. But it's 21 in America, right?|`|GqfiRXu3aa	Happy Birthday!!    I was happy to turn 18 but it wasn't that big of a deal.  19 was a little bit of a big deal since I could go to Canada to drink if I wanted to (which I rarely did).  20 &  21 are bigger deals.|`|JIoZG0Mnaa	yes i wasnt exactly excited either b/c now im so old or i feel so old|`|Z5o6uu0naa	I turned 17 today! But I wasnt that excited either-- I think when you get older it's not as exciting because people make less of a deal of it, and when you're younger it means more.|`|E71jweytaa	no to be honest its not. i remember mine wasn't to exhilarating either|`|FgaBo4Eraa	Aww Happy Birthday, sorry your not feeling it though.      It's a pretty exciting birthday (maybe less so for you if you can't drink, silly American rules, what are Uni students meant to do over there :P). Go have a fun time with all your friends I'd suggest or go for a nice meal with the family if that's more your thing. use the birthday as excuse to get everybody to look at you for a change :)    However you celebrate I hope you have a good one.|`|J1XwqvLGaa	It is normal. :) I turned 18 about a month ago, and it was nothing special to me. I think the age I'm looking for is 21, so I can actually DD for my brothers/sister/sister-in-law's, because I'd hate to see them in a car wreck. :'( I wouldn't mind slipping in a few drinks when I am actually 21 too, though.
di6KoUI4aa	My time was when i was ******* a guy in his car and than my neighbor saw the whole thing. So we just stoped. And moved it out back of my house :).|`|yzgS5KiQaa	I don't really have one. Maybe pushing my girlfriend away when she wanted to touch me but that just made me feel bad.|`|SPQdFOwKaa	I once were thinking of something (which would put me straight to Santa's Naughty Children List) and I let out this weird moan and our cleaning lady walked in and heard me and asked, "what's happening?" and I replied, "Uh, nothing, my back hurts." Oh, she knew alright!|`|ybn6beqiaa	Haha, um.. I dont think any times have been that embarrassing for me..   I think probably the worse time is when I just fell off the bed.. it wasnt that bad compared to some people though lol.|`|o9cAl8xhaa	My girlfriend's father walked in on us while we were having sex. He left without saying anything, but then told his mother (her grandmother) who scolded us.    Weird...|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	Our eldest daughter walked into our room (it was very early in the morning, and I swear I locked the damned door!) to find me standing up and my wife sitting on the bed, performing fellatio.  Our daughter (she was about eight at the time) said "Whatcha doin?"    YIPES!|`|N73oZyY8aa	I hooked up with a Marine on leave one time, we had a blast, danced, drank, I took him home and he was really randy. But, he was so bad in bed I fell asleep on him after a few hours, it took fovever. When I got up he was gone. I think his ego was destroyed.|`|Fy9Muy6Waa	How disrespectful to her from both you and your dad-him to not leave- you to not stop and try to cover her.|`|2ywzcoVqaa	My g/f was on top of me & I wanted to show her this pretty candle and just as I raised it she lowered her head & I ended up wacking her a good one in the face. We both just laughed it off.|`|6SwaWSoyaa	I actually think most teenager at least the age of fourteen can read this and handle it. It isn't like they haven't heard of sex, and most of them have probably done it (not that they should be though). I also agree with frustrated on this topic. Honestly though I would love for someone to walk in on me taking a dump on someone's chest because I think that would make a nice story.|`|k8jrTH3Xaa	Me and my ex were babysitting my little brothers while my mom was out.... I finally got the baby to sleep and so i put him in his crib in my mothers room and then We laid down in my moms bed one thing led to another and i was fingering her she asked me to choke her so i did then she asked me to use two fingers and i already was!!!!!! that's not the worst part i made her orgasm so loud she woke up the baby and then i found out she started her monthly all over my hand eww god it was horrible|`|jdah4ZA2aa	Gosh, I've got a ton, but this embarassed me most at the time    I was with a guy I really liked for the first time and we majorly broke the bed mid-sex.  I had to just stand there naked (which is hard for a self-conscious teenage girl!) while he tried to fix it because my clothes had somehow ended up underneath it!|`|GqfiRXu3aa	Mine was afterward.  The guy I liked was getting ready to leave, our clothes were strewn across the floor, and he put on MY jeans instead of  his own jeans.  A few minutes later he rang the doorbell and said, "Did I put on the wrong pants?"|`|V0EvTrkbaa	My boyfriend and I were having fun, naked, when my dad (who likes to visit unannounced) buzzed up to the flat. We had to dress in a hurry while he was coming up in the elevator and ended up wearing each others' shirts, which neither of us noticed until after he'd left. Since I'm not out, it's a source of panic and terror ("Did he notice? He didn't say anything. Was he looking at us funny? ohshitohshitohshit") whenever I think about it.

YOt6uTSzaa	They were afraid.....  Do you know why ? This is the first time He caused natures forces (created by God) to heed at His command.     Before that happened who knew what they where thinking of who He was.......  They said, "Who is this man," Notice they said... Man...  Jesus said, "Do you not have any faith."....  I am sure they change their view of Him pretty quickly...:)    They saw the Power of God....! Awesome.....|`|KK8zsJz2aa	Jawdrop reaction.|`|Gxz28zY1aa	They didn't have faith, so Jesus went over and said, "Why don't you have faith?"  They were discouraged.|`|8gDRQ7v2aa	They was relived because they thought that they was going to die.|`|OHydEvTCaa	They paniced and awoke Jesus to tell him about the boat filling up and asked Him did he care that they were about to die. After Jesus commanded the storm to "be quiet" and to "be still", He asked the disciples why were they afraid and why the had no faith. They were afraid!|`|0fnzDpKXaa	They said, "Lord, let's hope someday that a group called the SFECU is formed on Yahoo Answers to post hatred to Catholics."|`|oKAFHgscaa	Showoff !  ; ]  Just b/c your the big bad Son of God... If I had all authority in Heaven & on Earth, sure, I could've done the same thing.  ; ]    No, seriously, they said, who is this, that even the wind & the waves obey him!?!|`|4fTiCNiKaa	They mistook Him for a spirit, and they were afraid...    Matthew 14:22-33  22 And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.   23 And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.   24 But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.   25 And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.   26 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.    God bless!    Elder Greg  ~SFECU~  pray4revival|`|WUjlEuTtaa	They were amazed that the winds obeyed Him..|`|8rbQBaIeaa	It's interesting how they were afraid, yet they wanted Jesus to wake up to help them. When Jesus calmed the waters he ask them...where is your faith...The disciples said...yes he must be Lord. This is yet another story in the bible that is to teach us that no matter what we are facing thruout life we must have faith that Jesus is with us.|`|1bd7361886f753dc29575d47b7fb14d0aa	Yikes!|`|GeoiGjbCaa	They said "I'll bet you can't do that again!"|`|4boTYkt7aa	The same as ours would be,probably.

But if it did I would invite them out of my relationship with God.|`|jC2tOaPFaa	I forgive. it hasnt been said to me|`|oBL3AtRfaa	No one has ever said that to me, and I've been around for 55 years.    BUT if they were to say it, I'd probably answer "I never said I was a GOOD Christian (or a perfect one)."    Even Jesus lost it with the money changers in the temple.|`|5163421430fada657d83a91148b438e2aa	I say that to myself, I find it more helpful to judge myself instead of others|`|aPuj6xoHaa	I don't remember if anyone has ever said that to me, but if they have, it only goes to show the truth is that I am not perfect and I fail and that is why I need my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.|`|8e35f8f7c61bfe408de6b89c171fd161aa	The Bible says that even God grows weary of repentance is what I think.   I still forgive, just as God has forgiven me. I would find it utterly against Jesus to ignore that aspect.|`|x2UCx6WVaa	That person would be my elderly mother.

gmaCvh00aa	The Episcopal Church is the closest to Catholic of any Protestant denomination.  If you go to an Episcopal (also sometimes called Anglican because it was born out of the Church of England) you will have no trouble with the eucharist, because the responses are exactly the same.    Some differences are that while Episcopalians study the saints with an eye to Christian lives well lived, they don't worship them or pray to them.  Also, they do not believe the Bishop of Rome (Pope) is superior to any other Bishop and he is not the head of the church.  The Archbishop of Canterbury is head of the Anglican Communion, but it's a title only, not a superiority.  Episcopalians also dropped the idea of Purgatory that the Catholic Church picked up to appease converts who were used to ancestor worship.    Let's see..there is a prayer of confession before Communion, but it's the prayer of the members of the church incorporated into the service and not a required individual confession, although you can request to confess to a priest if you feel the need to.    And the priests can marry and have families.  Basically, the Episcopal Church went back to the earliest practices of the Christian Church and dumped anything that was added along the way, where as most other Protestant churches dumped everything and started totally new church forms.  If you are already confirmed Catholic, you don't have to be reconfirmed if you join an Episcopal church because they both believe in confirmation through the Apostolic Succession, which the other churches don't follow.    Most people in the Episcopal church these days came from another denomination originally.  The priest at the church I used to attend was a former Catholic and his wife was a former Baptist.    -------------->>>Seconding what others here have said--Transubstantiation can be believed by Episcopalians but it's not necessary to believe in it, and yes, the rites and formalities of the church vary from "high" to "low".|`|0312ec6bd9788b0c6bf89b026c84d0c6aa	Well the main difference is that one is Catholic and the other is Protestant, and among the Protestant beliefs of Anglicanism is that Christ is not really and truly present in the Eucharist.  God bless.|`|1V1PzEYZaa	I was brought up going to the Church of England.    The Lord's Prayer is longer for starters and C of E do not believe that the bread/wine is the actual body of Christ, but is symbolic.    Catholic Churches vary in their ceremonies as do Anglican churches, but it's not that different.|`|r8qJecrMaa	They've generally got a smaller congregation!|`|AA11521494	It depends what sort of Anglican - it embraces a wide range of liturgical practice ranging from more catholic than catholic to very protestant.  If it's high or anglo-catholic, you won't notice a lot of difference.  There may well be more congregational singing, though, and you'll probably find a lot of hymns you don't know.  The low church end is more variable, but you'll find if it's a communion service then it'll have all the same ingredients as mass, just done in a less ceremonial way.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Anglican services are very similar.    Totally without any divine authority behind it, but otherwise, very close.|`|294e1701917b0ab03a81e21b3d809bd2aa	anglican churches dont acknowledge the saints or the blessed mother. they dont have an official first communion for second graders, nor confirmation ceremony. and you dont get baptised as an infant, instead thsy wait till the kid becomes like 13, then the kid has to asked to be "saved" in front of the whole congregation. the preacher will ask the kid if he/she is willing to accept christ as their savior, renounce the devil,etc. then after that they r scheduled for a total immersion baptism in a tank of water or lake depending on the church in a white robe.ther is lots more singing in an anglican church as opposed to the pray & response they have in the catholic church. they do celebrate easter & christmas, but not the feast days of the saints like st. joseph, etc. anglican churches also have lots of community/social activities for youth and adults, like outings, breasfasts, dinners, organized trips, christian singles groups where ppl can meet  &, organized child & teen social groups /sports|`|7NugugsDaa	My whole side of my dad's family is Catholic so I have been there with my grandma many of times. I liked it. My mom's whole side of her family is Baptist I was raised that way. I love the Baptist Church. The two differences from my experience that I can tell you is: You hear a reading from a Catholic Church out of the Bible. (My dad's aunt is a Nun) Which is beautiful. But in a Baptist Church not only do you get a reading, the pastor explains what the Bible is saying. Which I can understand more. Catholic seems more Holier more ancient. I just understand Baptist more.Even though I do have the highest respect for Catholics.|`|AA10067344	I think you'll find most Christian masses are relatively similar.|`|peFtORvUaa	Catholic churches have a tabernacle,its what makes the church a Holy place because the Body of Christ is there..

What if they come out looking more Black than White, then what? Are you going to cast them aside? Perhaps you should get a pet or something that requires less attention (and less brain capacity to take care of) before you even consider having kids.|`|lqzmJlrRaa	I WOULDN'T SAY THAT SANDY. GOD MIGHT MAKE YOUR CHILD A HANDICAP YET SO BE AFRAID. I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE CHILDREN AT ALL. YOU DON'T DESERVE THEM.|`|AEqOczcCaa	Actually, they can turn out looking full white or half black.    Skin color is a funny thing in that this could happen     http://www.babble.com/CS/blogs/strollerd...    But skin color shouldn't be what determines if you will love and accept your future children.|`|WAoNhHB1aa	I guess.  Why do you reject and dislike your black half?  WTF?|`|thVN9X2Baa	No, actually they could have all of the physical attributes of either race.Or half and half or many other possible fraction types.

They could look 100% black, you never know...|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	My brother married a white woman and have a kid that looks like Derek Jeter.|`|jbDTsZyBaa	If it matters that much to you maybe you shouldn't have kids. There can be no guarantees as to what your kids will look like. Couldn't you just hope that they will be healthy?|`|dkBSZsnxaa	You should not be allowed to reproduce. And just to pour some knowledge in that ignorant brain of yours; My dad was half black half white and my mom is white. I look black, but my brother has blonde hair and blue eyes. If you are unhappy with who you are, why dont you just go jump off a bridge? Do the world a favor; one less racist.|`|OZjlW5utaa	You shouldn't have kids if you act like this,  at least biracials who identify with being black, acknowledge their white side, you don't do this to your black side.    And you are wrong, I myself have the same racial mixture as your 'future' child, and I might have a light complexion but I have very curly hair, full lips and people always spot my 'difference' and know I'm mixed. My brother also has a light brown complexion, you can't challenge genetics, your child might inherit your black side genes, what will you do then?|`|9EpMhhtVaa	YOU may consider yourself white however you are black, scociety considers you black.  I'm not a racist, I am a black man and I have white blood in me, my great grandfather was a white man so I guess I'm 1/4 white but I look like a black man, however the whiteness in me shows in my ability to grow a super-thick beard (you do not see any Africans with beards)...I can't dance either....There is a great chance that your kids will look a lot like you as far as skin complexion and they may be darker because the gene that makes white people's skin white is a recessive gene and the gene that makes black people skin black is dominate.  There is a great chance that your husband will have some African in him as well, in fact all white people trace their roots back to Africa so I'm sorry sweetie...be proud of your black side!|`|QTjP6Nx4aa	It depends. Since you have black genes, there is all ways a ghost of a chance that your offspring could inherit traits. They could possibly look black or white or mixed. If you marry a white person, chances are that they will look white, black if you marry a black person. There is the old "one drop rule" but it is not law. I am 1/8 black but I don't look it nor do any of my children my family. I don't have black on my birth certificate. I depends on both parents. If your children marry an african American, they will probably look black, and if they marry a caucasian, they will most likely look white. Society DOES NOT CARE about your ancestry, its all in how you look. If someone looks white, i'm not gonna say they are black. And vice verse.

BfmV2KpUaa	You could try asking the neighbour what all the banging is about. If it becomes a tit-for-tat "you make too much noise" then contact your local council Environmental Health department. They'll send someone around to take readings, from both houses if allowed access, to check the vibrations are within legal levels. You can also phone your local police station and make a complaint, which they have to follow up by sending an officer round to have a word.  There's no simple solution however, and I do sympathise, having been there myself. I had an upstairs neighbour who was a little bit mentally ill, and created a hell of a fuss at the slightest sound from the flat above him. He ended up being taken into care, and I moved out anyway.  You may have to settle on the fact that they are old and will hopefully die soon. If they have anger management issues, then that probably won't be too far off.    Edit; Jocasta gives excellent advice. To avoid seeming confrontational, just tell them you heard banging and were concerned for them. It'll seem like you're just being neighborly and making sure they are okay. Perhaps they'll get the idea then.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	I'd turn the TV up louder so I could hear it over their banging.    Or I'd walk next door and tell them that their banging is interrupting your show.|`|FcZU29W6aa	I honestly believe if you talk to them in a very nice, sypmathetic, caring tone that they will be a bit on the embarrassed side.    Tell them that you are concerned and certainly don't want to disturb them in any way.  If your tv is near your adjoining wall with them, they are probably hearing the bass from your tv and it probably is very irritating.  If it is against that wall, explain to them that you will move the tv and to be sure and let you know if that does not solve the problem.    Years ago, we had a bird that I would put out on our porch in the morning so he could get sunshine (he was in his cage!).  Evidently his chirping got on the neighbors' nerves.  Rather than call me in the morning when the bird was chirping, they waited until 3:00 a.m. and called me on the phone, asking how I liked being awakened when I was sound asleep.  My first thought was "Gee, couldn't you be nicer about this?"  However, I apologized and asked them what time they got up in the morning.  We agreed that the bird would not go outside until after 10:00 a.m.  By the way, this was a parakeet, so he was not that loud.    Anyhow, just to make amends, a few days later I was baking bread and thought I'd take a loaf over to them.  They were known as the "neighborhood grouches".  It was so worth it.  At first they were embarassed and did not know what to say.  It was probably the first time they had seen any kindness in a long time.  After that, they were always so nice -- even to the other neighbors.    Good luck with this.  Let us know what happens.|`|pNy8lakjaa	Is your television made after 1993? Do you still have the original remote to it? Then why not turn on the closed captions when they are banging, you can turn down the TV and still understand what is being said. Check the menu option on your TV.     I would mention that you keep hearing some banging, and go over to "check up" to make sure that they are doing ok.|`|AA10671142	first place that is rude of them to bang on anyone's wall. as long as your tv is on low at night, they have no right to bang.

I do not condone violence though.  there are several things you could try such as leaving the TV on loud and going out for a few hours.  You could buy one of these irritating clocks that sets off an awful alarm and leave it on and go out?  Put your hi fi on loud heavy metal music?  Every time they bang your wall then switch on a power drill?    You could offer to look for a good nursing home for them? *LOL*|`|AA10672818	take this problem to your landlord|`|c74aca35559d33687415f5d474888634aa	I'd politely talk to them about it :)|`|7101ca25abf1e27ea43268cf9eca7944aa	Go next door and ask them what there problem is, tell them if that if your parent's in the next room can't hear you, then you can't see how they can, they might just want some one to talk to.|`|Jj8JlApvaa	my dear, please understand this,   your noise probably will not be heard by your parents' because the TV is against the wall to your neighbors, remember this'... its the BASS on your set that irritates people, [like a diesel lorry] up and down  old people go to bed about 10pm.    and when you hear the bass go up and down with commercials it sends you barmy.     Don't go on the defensive, understand your mistakes.|`|kXhAERt3aa	Who could you complain to?  Who owns the house or the apartment?  You can make a formal complaint that they are fighting with the neighbors on the other side too loudly and now they want you to change your routine which has been fine with them for years!  This is their problem, not yours.  You could bang back, I suppose, or find out what the other people on the other side are doing and do the same thing only more-so, so that they move back into that bedroom and away from yours.  You can let them know that you had to do this because they would not stop banging on the walls after they moved into the bedroom beside yours - you are doing it in self-defense.    Or, you can move your TV away from that wall, or face it the other direction so that it is not facing or with the back right to that wall.  You can also hang a couple of blankets on the wall so that they cannot hear the noise from the TV as much - which might shut them up.  I cannot imagine that the other neighbors are not much more irritating than your TV - they need to show some tolerance for normal noise levels - even if they feel sensitive about it because of the folks on the other side of them.

JXMpZiwxaa	Yes, a headcovering the same color as your hair may stand out less, as probably would a hat.    Debra M., one of the most respected Catholics on this forum (before she passed away last summer at age 39, R.I.P.) used to keep her head covered constantly, and she felt God gave her more graces because of this.    If someone reacts negatively, I'd recommend offering the persecution to Mary, the mother of Jesus, for the conversion of sinners or the souls in purgatory.  Our sufferings have redemptive value.    "Blessed are they who suffer persecution for the sake of righteousness; the Kingdom of God is theirs."|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	You can wear it if you want, but please understand it is by no means required of you.

HiHQvqodaa	It's an old way of praising a girl's beauty: "Ay?n ond?rd gibi gzel" - "She's pretty like the fourteenth of the month." In the Islamic calendar, full moon always happens on the fourteenth of the month (because the Islamic calendar is lunar, i.e. it's based on cycles of the moon phase). The symbolism is that full moon is bright and beautiful, and so is the girl.    This compliment became a bit obsolete after Turkey officially adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1926.    Edit: Yes, the phrase is still used, especially in songs and poems.

The answer is yes, but the workings, just like in a math problem, can be long and convoluted and really don't always make sense.    My quick answer, is that you should go sit in a playground for a while, or listen to your small brother or sister. Wait for one of those fantastic laughs that little children can laugh. Its magic. Like a bubbling stream without a care in the world. No worries of where its going to end up or how long it will take to get there or whether a cow will fall into it and drown or if there is a dam in the way. I think you get what I mean.    Give yourself a hug, or get a friend or family member to give you one. That darkness can be pretty self-feeding and you stop looking for all the right reasons to make this world a good place.    In the more philosophical way, the answer to your question is still a yes, but you have to work hard at it. There are over six thousand million human beings running around on this amazing ball spinning in a space made up of enormous distances (raised to the power of mind-boggling) and trying to compare one life to all of that just doesn't compute. You just have to make the most of all the good stuff you can get (and not take it,) try to guide others in a positive view of the place and hope you can start a ripple strong enough to become a wave that washes over all the evil that lurks inside man's heart.    That should keep you busy for a while and keep the black thoughts at bay.|`|1HLPznZhaa	This question has been asked in some form or another since the beginning of man.

To plainly say " will you become something" you say what Rot suggested ( ni narimasu)but to say " will you be MY valentine" you need an extra part     watashi no barentain ni nattekuremasenn ka?" Or roughly " won't you give me becoming my valentine?"..it sounds weird..but it is an honor society after all. without that extra part the meaning is confusing.

AA12248887	Sensationalism sells!    Professionalism doesn't sell as much as sensationalism, and that is the sad thing of it. People who entered the career of journalism with high ideals of how news should be conveyed to people end up being bent into the shape their bosses want because that is what "experts" and "trend analysts" tell them. Somewhere along the line they forgot that journalism is not supposed to have a slant. Facts are supposed to be conveyed to the public in such a way that they may form their own opinion.    If you mix a lack of expertise in a certain field into the matter, you end up with what we have, journalists having to write about stuff they don't understand for people who know less and having to meet an impressive agenda or lose their jobs.    The tricky bit is that one cannot ask governments to step in and control the media, police them back into an ethical, impartial truth telling machine. It has to come from inside the media itself and the industry has too many interests.    NB. Excellent last paragraph. Best way to spend our wealth is by making sure nobody wants ours because theirs is good. That would take the wind out of the sails of those that would wish us ill.

They also are very fond of manipulating statistics.
yzgS5KiQaa	Because if you don't know how to do something, it is generally harder to do. Trail and error baby. Go shopping. Try a ton of clothes on. Just to see what looks good, what your size is, what fits, and what you like. Soon you'll be able to see something on the rack and now if it looks good on you. Then look up hairstyles, on the internet, or fashion magazines, cut out or print out anything and everything you like, and write down Why you like it. You have to develop your own sense of aesthetics, you have to make yourself attractive, according to what you find attractive. Also good hygiene and charisma helps, a lot.|`|TjPwxbuJaa	I think that most people can make themselves much better looking. I did. The best thing I did was work out. When you have a good and lean body, the attractiveness of your face becomes secondary. Furthermore, go to a good hair stylist and try a new cut. That can almost make one look better.  Look, not everybody can look like a Hollywood actor, and actually being overly good-looking can be a detriment because you don't want somebody to be with you just because of your looks! But you do want to catch some eyes.|`|kFv1pGeNaa	make sure you're cleanly groomed and have a good sense of style|`|InlCtFHuaa	it's funny how a really hot dude can be scruffy and wear what he wants and people think it just makes him hotter|`|f48gha45aa	Honestly. Looks are in the eye of the beholder.    Like, when I was younger (like in grade school) I used to think I was terribly ugly. Why? Because I didn't have a good self-esteem, that was never established at my home, so I never good enough at anything, including looks.    I moved away from home a little over two years ago for college. I met friends in a new place, I felt accepted, I started feeling better about myself (mind you, this is a process that started in high school, meeting friends that cared about me, which helped me to care about myself).  As I felt better about myself, more people would say, oh you're cute, yadda yadda yadda.   This year, I'm feeling better than ever, and I've been having a good handful of people hitting on me at once. At first it was uncomfortable because I didn't believe what they were saying, but now I am starting to accept it, I'm not ugly, I'm no Denzel or Brad, but I'm not ugly.  You want to know what attracts people, confidence. I've seen people, who are in my opinion, not the most attractive people, but they have bf/gfs, some people rely on personality, some rely on looks.  The more confident you are, the more people will notice and pay attention to you.  You can't expect anyone to think you are attractive and you can't think it yourself.    Go in front of a mirror, stand there and look at yourself. What do you like about yourself? Focus on those features and find ways to draw attention to them.    I used to hate mirrors, I would avoid them because I didn't like them, but I am learning to love myself. Now, I look in the mirror and I like what I see. Nothing has really changed about my look, just how I feel. And I get more attention because of it.    I want you to do the same thing. It will take time, but trust me, it will be so worth it.    Good luck. :D|`|mYe6TDmzaa	Well I guess I am attractive because people always give me compliments but I don't wear make up but I am going to start.  I always wear matching clothes nice hair and cool shoes.  So I guess thats how you do it. Before I started dressing with style nobody complimented me except for my smile.
X5hTmAkBaa	ww1? i dunno >_>   never heard about this|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	LOL. I've never heard that...maybe it's because the ground is cool under there, I don't know.|`|BWt4mj13aa	lol.

FcZU29W6aa	I agree with the previous answer -- it is a little low cut.  Could they alter it with lace or something like that.  Otherwise, the dress is perfect.  Maybe even wear a scarf or something like that.    Just saw your additional info -- a cream colored tank top would probably look great -- just be sure to try it on with the dress to make sure it fits right and doesn't bunch up or something like that.|`|76nTvO4iaa	It's a cute dress, but it looks a little too low cut for a Saturday morning service.|`|dPGbFd1Faa	its a cute dress, but it is too low cut
d3N60SuSaa	It depends on the relationship. It's proven that people that live together that aren't married are less likely to actually get married. That's not true for everyone but if you plan on marrying that person you need to be sure that it is actually is going to happen. Otherwise the man will probably get comfortable with having all of the perks of a marriage and not having to actually do it. Also it's important not to move in together too soon because that can also ruin any future plans. You just have to be careful about the decision of moving in together and think about the consequences.|`|3cLA6wCWaa	I am for it. Who says you can't? Religion? Society? Family?      The reason I am for it is because things are MUCH different when you move in with someone. Therefore, what better way to determine if you and your proposed spouse are compatible?|`|AEqOczcCaa	Well if you're gay and the law in your region prevents you from getting married, I guess that's the best thing you could do.|`|JxUFDutxaa	I don't think it's a good idea.|`|BWt4mj13aa	No. I am a virgin until marriage.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	I'm not for it. But if you are getting physical be sure to use birth control, because you don't want a child born out of wed-lock... I'm against it all together for that reason and because I'm a Christian, and that goes against the Bible. If everyone did that, then what would be the use of marriage?
JxUFDutxaa	I'm older than you..but I'm sooooo in the exact predicament..  It gets frustrating, doesn't it when they're not taking your seriously when you're trying to be serious..    My advice..try to lower the amount of times your being "a goofball" or being really funny.    People always expect you to be "on" and ready to give them a good laugh if they always see you doing it..  The more you show them a serious side..or just a non funny side..the more they wil get the hint..but it will take a while..and it's an uphill battle.    Good luck my friend..|`|VsamHLPOaa	Once people put you in a certain category its usually no coming back from that. From what you've stated it seems that that's the impression your giving off. People like to laugh and if your the person making it happen than there less likely to let you or should I say your personality go.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	Before you begin a conversation that you want your friends to take seriously, preface it with "I am being serious for a second..."|`|BWt4mj13aa	Try to be a bit more serious consisitently.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	Just demand respect...If someone goes too far with a joke, then don't laugh...just set your jaw and look at them. I also agree with the first answerer, start out with something like, "No joke" or "Seriously". Maybe open up a bit with people...if people only know you to joke with them, then they will only feel comfortable joking with you...But if you have a serious conversation with them once in a while, then they will feel comfortable doing the same with you.
B63fwyW5aa	im just like you i dont like it either and every1 voice sounds funny when you hear it..even mine but people think u just sound the same  just breathe in and be confident...YOU CAN DO IT GURL!!!|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	I don't know anyone who likes the sound of their own voice on a recording.

Also, did you know that your voice sounds different to you than it does to others, because you are hearing it resonate in your head, and others hear it as it really sounds.    When I first started listening to my own voice played back, it sounded weird, but actually it was how everyone else hears it every day.  When I got used to it I realised it wasn't weird at all, just different from what I associate with me.|`|7360955bdb6204c33b9cfd068b9d6cf7aa	don't worry about your voice, your teacher and classmates don't think there's anything wrong with it, as somebody already said, everybody perceives its own voice in a different way when listening it from a recording. it's like "I didn't know I sound like that". focus on your play and just go for it.|`|4myG3rbKaa	you will sound fine just do it and get it over with|`|LLvetbbpaa	everyone hates their voice on tape. i hate my voice on tape but everyone says it just sounds like a normal voice. you just have to get used to it xD|`|sqaRnidQaa	get voice lessons. try to project your voice from deeper in you throat.|`|V5akMpDAaa	everyone's voice sounds like that when its recorded, so dont worry about it. as far as stage fright or being nervous, just practice in front of your mirror or read your lines to your parents. go over how you want it to happen in your head, and it will work out fine.|`|qG752H8Qaa	talk to your teacher|`|93Z4xWiYaa	We all sound silly to ourselves or so we think ! It's just something we aren't used to doing, "listening to ourself"... Trust me, you sound just as good as anyone else.......     Be positive... Tell yourself that you ARE good at this and that you WILL do a good job and that AS GOOD AS ANYONE else in that room. Look at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself these things twice a day between now and then. Believe it... Practice it... and get up do it like we all know you can !|`|pmna8fhyaa	Try not to give a damn about how you do, and just do.    About your voice: when you speak, the sounds get to your ears through the air, but also through your skull (the bones), whereas when you listen to a recording of your voice, the sounds get to your ears only through the air. That is why a recording doesn't sound like you.    But don't worry, to other people you have always sounded like the recording, so they won't think it's babyish.|`|Y4ffFdBqaa	YOU BE OK  JUST LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND SAY THE LINES OUT LOUD [ O ROMEO WHY  O WHY ] AND SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR JUST WATCH THE MOVIE OVER AND OVER THEN MEMORIES THE LINES.PEACE OF CAKE [YUM I CHOSE CAKE ANY DAY OVER ROMEO ]|`|o2r5eKnxaa	Just remember that when you hear your own voice it always sounds strange from a recording. The reason why is that when you speak, your voice sounds fuller, or more complete, as it were because you hear it through your skull (the sound waves resonate through your head). You have been hearing your own voice when you talk all your life in this manner. So, when you hear a recording of your voice your brain perceives it as being weak, since it recognizes it as being your voice but not the sound that it is use to. This is the reason why you can tell if someone is "loosing their voice" because you know that their voice is weaker than usual. That is similarly to what you experienced, except that your voice isn't weak at all- it's just the way your brain perceives the sound waves after being used to hearing it in a different manner for so long. You may think your voice sounds babyish but I can guarantee it is perfectly normal.     I'm not sure what you're worried about as for reading/ talking but I am going to assume it's because of your voice. If that's the case then you have nothing at all to worry about as I just explained. If it is because your shy about public speaking then the best way to overcome it is to actually... keep doing practicing! I would suggest instead of being called on to read or act, you may want to volunteer first so that at least you have control of what you're doing and you will feel more comfortable. Also, that way, the teacher will be less inclined to call on you randomly because he/she knows that you volunteer anyways.    I hope this helps. You can email me if you have any more details or if I didn't answer your question correctly/ misinterpreted your question.|`|dKB17UKFaa	I think you're just over-stressing about it all.  Even though you don't want to, not only will it help you on your stage presence, but also on public speaking.  Who knows - maybe you'll even like it and become an actress one day!    When you record your voice, sometimes programs sound quality is a bit off.  It might distort your voice in certain ways, or you might be altering it in a way because of the fact you know you are being recorded.  I do that a lot, and it's just a matter of getting comfortable behind the microphone.    Try doing some vocal warm ups before recording yourself! :)|`|zDf186Xyaa	OMG!  i thaught i was the only one who feels this. All i can say is be proud of who you are, get used to your voice because end of the day thats you and Juliet is the fictional character and your the real 1 ;)|`|VsWTjrOAaa	when you start of don't be nervous and don't think about what you sound like. Unless you have recorded yourself on a professional machine you won't sound like the recording.     Once you get into the play you should be fine.     Learn your lines and what you have to do, this will make you less nervous as you are more prepared.     I hate reading or talking out loud in class but we shouldn't care what other people think. Just be confident, none of the other students will criticize you and they will probably say you were good if you acted confidently and put 100% effort into the play.|`|AA11230878	Throw a sicky over the week end and carry it over to Monday|`|2h913O0Saa	Yeah, i'm the same it's so embarassing :$|`|69b929d341b49df84c23149c7790163faa	You'll do fine.

It puts out a strong message to people about how hard it is sometimes to deal with being gay/lesbian.  It's even harder when it's your own parent's coming down on you and shoving religion down your throat. And it shows how people read the Bible and only read what they want about homosexuality.  This poor guy was pushed to hard and didn't know what to do anymore. People need to understand, we don't just choose to be this way, we are made this way. Its a hard lifestyle to live sometimes.  I couldnt believe the part where his mom said "I dont have a son"! OMG!  Yes, I cried throughout it. It is a very good movie with a very good message.

7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	This is an example of limited predestination, from the Catechism of the Catholic Church:    "Jesus handed over according to the definite plan of God"     599 Jesus' violent death was not the result of chance in an unfortunate coincidence of circumstances, but is part of the mystery of God's plan, as St. Peter explains to the Jews of Jerusalem in his first sermon on Pentecost: "This Jesus [was] delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God."393 This Biblical language does not mean that those who handed him over were merely passive players in a scenario written in advance by God.394     600 To God, all moments of time are present in their immediacy. When therefore he establishes his eternal plan of "predestination", he includes in it each person's free response to his grace: "In this city, in fact, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place."395 For the sake of accomplishing his plan of salvation, God permitted the acts that flowed from their blindness.396     Note the two different "threads" that operate in the above statement.    God does what only God can do, knowing all and seeing all, from eternity.    Man does whatever he chooses, but in the end, God's will always prevails, because God is more than capable of taking into account all the feeble and ill considered actions of mankind.    Your idea is more in line with Calvin's discredited theory of "double predestination" which makes life meaningless, salvation unnecessary, judgment a joke, and the concept of a redeemer essentially superfluous.|`|Hn7t9mZwaa	Free will.........you will not pay for it...it's free|`|uvTAeAKlaa	You ARE good because you choose to be.

Also, they do not intervene in any way opposite to our will. This means they would never do anything drastic to change your mind. They will aid you whatever your choice might be. If you add these little things then suddenly free will actually makes sense.|`|RDWzGxb7aa	You have to decide how much you agree with the premise that everything we do is determined.

Our past experiences probably affect us more, but we can always make choice, its like Schroedinger's cat, you don't know if it's dead until you open the box or something like that.

There really isn't much free will other than that. We are all restricted by the circumstances of our birth. Our family, gender, life opportunities, social standing, is all largely determined at birth. Not to say that people should not work toward a more equitable society, but then even that begins to put restrictions on individuals. But then if you live in a highly inequitable society, then everything just depends on your birth anyway, or just getting really lucky.

Act 9:15 But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:     The 7000 Zadock also do not have free will.  GOD will use them because they will not bow to baal/Satan.    Rom 11:4 But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to [the image of] Baal.     Rom 8:28 And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to [his] purpose.|`|xAjTXYLUaa	you will always have a choice in everything involving yourself, giving you free will to choose how you re-act in any giving situation. think about something bad that happened to you,didn't you have a choice on how to re-act to the situation? thus giving you free will to choose or decide how you live your life.

There are certain rules that are followed in any Church.  I need to learn what Jesus expects of me and what the Church expects of me.  The Church is made up of people who hopefully what to know the Lord better.  I can always go to another Church.    Thankfully, as a Roman Catholic, I can go to over 50 Churches within 10 miles, all under Rome.  If there is real trouble, I can go to those in charge and ask for their opinion on my issue with the Church or what the teachings are, or how to better get along with individuals as we are called to love others as our self.  If not satisfied, there I may go to the priest, then the bishop, etc.    However, I cannot demand the Church be a certain way or the people be a certain way though I have thought before I had some good ideas that turned out not so good later on.  I am a guest and must be on my best behavior including dressing and addressing others appropriately, with love as the golden rule calls us to do.

I'm not saying to give up on religion, but there are many online churches and communities where you can have fellowship with your brethren and receive the spiritual guidance that a church provides.    Also, maybe this would give you some time alone with God, so you can understand him in your own way without all of the hateful chatter mucking everything up.    You also might be comfortable in a Unitarian (Universalism) Church, where people are not so concerned about finger-pointing, and more concerned with celebrating their faith(s) and fellowship.|`|AA11864826	The same way I handle sincere church people.

My pastor does not stand for people being treated bad. If they are teaching the Bible you probably already know what's being preached. Our church teaches that Jesus died on the cross for our sins. Key word is OUR. The pastor is a reformed and forgiven drug and alcohol abuser. So are many of our other leaders in our church. They don't try to hide their pasts either, they are very up front about it. Our pastor reminds us we are all sinners. The difference is that Christians are forgiven sinners. No amount of good works and fancy words will get us to Heaven. Grace is unmerited, undeserved, grace is what we get when we accept Christ in our lives. God's undeserved grace for our stupid sins. Not a bad deal is it?|`|UXuGCgo3aa	I usually would try to correct them, as doing so is the Christian thing to do.  I would attempt to do it patiently and gently, as Christ did, but after some time I would be more authoritative.

I think your normal and your going to have some form of life after death.  Now where or what kind of life you live after death pretty much depends on what you believe in your heart.|`|dINfAO02aa	Buddhists believe that when you die you are reincarnated. they also believe that peace= happiness. But worship Buddha, not god.  There are different levels of Buddhism so that is probably what you would be considered. I am a spiritualist. I believe also in reincarnation. I believe that you should not worship god but meditate to be happiest with yourself. IN a spiritual church everyone is excepted, even if you have lingering believes about god, devil, extra. I do not believe in the devil, but I am not sure about god. I also like the Buddhist belief that if you meditate the anger out of your life everything will go well!|`|32weJyKCaa	first of all, jesus probably finds it very annoying when homers(humans) go around presuming to speak for jesus. i hope jesus ***** slaps all of these stone-casting big-mouths.  second, i think labels narrow our minds and force us to focus on definitions instead of beliefs. fyi reincarnation was in the bible until it was removed to allow the church more power - as far as i am concerned, i believe i will be reunited with my wolf-dog Zephyr who died and i want us to reincarnate as mother and son so if you get sent to hell, look me up - seriously, look into pantheism. be kind to your judges, they "know not what they do"|`|zbAKxm0daa	Since I am not certain what the Agnostic view is on what happens to the souls after death, I couldn't say with certainty that you would be considered Agnostic; but it is a possibility.    You are definitely a seeker, though.  You seek a path that makes sense to you.  So there are options and you should examine them all, but the most likely fits would be:    Buddhism, Paganism (there are a lot of Pagan paths) or Taoism to start with.    There is also Shamanism, which is the oldest of the religious paths, but also requires more work than any other path in order to learn it.    Those may lead you to other paths that feel better to you.    Whatever path is right for you is the correct path for you.  Don't listen to what people tell you that you should believe; listen to your heart.    Your self description sounds, initially, to be Agnostic, but you are definitely a seeker.    Find the path that makes you happy, that feels like "home" to you, whether that takes you some where else or leaves you right where you are, is not the point.  It is where you are happiest that matters.|`|Bc9uyrfGaa	the a in atheist means "none" and thiest means "believer in god" so even if you believe something happens after you die you're still an atheist.|`|tiTAYiLZaa	hmmm...well it depends.  add what you believe happens after death|`|wVULcpUnaa	Buddhism believes in reincarnation.|`|4G6No8oZaa	You are an atheistic since you have a non-belief in any deity. YOU are not a Buddhist , since they believe reincarnation can come in different shapes and forms , you can incarnate as an animals( depending on your behavior in this life) but probably you are spiritual. Believing that there must be something beyond this life just makes you an optimistic.

His work was widely criticized, not because it was wrong, but because a mechanical body made us too much like animals, therefore eliminating the need for a soul. Nevertheless, belief in the soul persisted despite the fact that Descartes was eventually proven to be correct about the role of the nerves in sensation and movement to an extent (he had the specific mechanism wrong, though it was a good guess). The fact that the body works in mechanical, predictable, and understandable ways is the basis of modern medicine.    This story highlights a simple fact: virtually everything we've experienced has been shown to have a naturally-occurring cause. As a result, it isn't far-fetched to assume that the few pieces that are left would have naturally-occurring causes as well.|`|RKQTD9Dhaa	It beats the heck out of believing the world is flat.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	The alternative being?

TQ6JG5V3aa	When I first started going out with my boyfriend, I went to his family meal, and drank a tad too much and at the end of the evening asked his Mum for sex tips...and had a wonderful conversation with his Gran about conception (groan...)  The best one I've been present for wasn't actually me but some girl I know, who is a bit ditzy...  We were at wrestling training, and my friend's sister had come to watch. My friend's sister is disabled. She is in a wheelchair, she has no legs, and her body is kinda out of proportion, so someone would easily tell that she was permanently disabled and not just broken her leg or whatever. So this other girl who used to train with use is talking to her and suddenly asks 'so how long have you been training?' all serious. I felt really bad for the girl, but at the same time I was just so amazed at how silly she was. lol    Oh and another time, my friend worked in a supermarket and asked some guy if he would like 'a hand' with his packing...before realising he had no hands.|`|vAMKuJl8aa	there was a huge rumor going around my high school that the new assistant principal had been fired from his last job because of sexual harassment to young girls on the campus.  the rumor was so big that even some teachers and subs admitted to believing it too..    well i was so confused as to how a man who was fired from his last job for inappropriate behavior would be allowed to get another job at another school surrounded by young girls.    well.. so as i was really wondering this i was in a hair salon getting my hair done saying this to my hair dresser.    there was a woman next to me who asked what my assistant principals name was and i told her and she looked VERY offended and said in a very matter-of -fact tone "that is not true at all.. i know this because he is a very close friend."    i felt really stupid.. but i for surely thought the rumor was true because EVERY one was saying it.. not just students.    so about 3 months later i met a girl who went to a school that my assistant principal used to teach at..  when i said his name she said "he's got another job at another school? he was fired from my school for sexual harassment!"    so i guess the rumor was right..  but then again i felt very stupid when that woman corrected me in the hair salon|`|c8f2b08d3fd8fb61fb9b5b49572c858faa	i was asked to be in a friend's wedding. as she was gushing about all to bought especially bridesmaids dresses i said:  "i just hate pastel colored, fluffy bridesmaids dresses, they make you look like a bags of cotton candy. i especially dislike pale greens and pale pinks. so what are your colors?"    the dresses chosen were  iridescent lime green with a chiffon barbie pink sash/ribbon with matching pink shoes.|`|U8oR3VU6aa	There was this man who had lost a leg to diabetes had a homeless shelter and I was helping with food distribution.

15b68e83c3ef9d01d0153600c96e7fe3aa	I know you asked this as a joke, but...    I have never been able to understand the mindset of a so-called intelligent race of humans that encourages, even demands, the unnatural altering of the human body for the sake of vanity, ego and to appease the opposite sex.    We burn our skin's tissues (tattoos and tans) to look cool, inject plastic into our women's chest to enlarge and expand breasts, take a blade and cut off the natural hair that nature provided us with, go under a surgeon's knife to have our faces and body parts altered to fit into a specific and narrow concept of beauty. We color our hair, inject foreign objects into our bodies, then slap on paint to cover the other perceived flaws dictated by the culture that we let control us and we do so, like aimless sheep, seemingly willingly.    The only thing we owe purselves and our bodies is to keep our body weight down, eat healthy, exercise, avoid abusing our bodies and to maintain self-esteem about the true value of who we are. We owe nothing to a society that expects us to abuse our natural bodies for the sake of someone else's concept of beauty.    Do what you will with your body. it's your body. But please do so to feel comfortable with yourself, not to please others.|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	Its a choice thing, like everything in life.|`|DbyvTE4laa	i seriously doubt it !!!|`|yzRHAWNhaa	You mean you have been?

I find for myself, it's easier to decide to do something, an than work out a script, than just wait until the right moment. For example. The first time I gave oral. I decided I was OK giving oral to that person. And when the opportunity arose, I just went over to them and did it, neither of us said a word, it was beautiful an unplanned. An that's how I like to do things. That way, when I'm in the situation, I just start repeating the script, there's no pressure. Like I've decided to tell my sisters I'm dating a girl and I'm trans. So the next time that my girlfriend comes up, I won't hide it, that's my script. So I'm not nervous about telling them, since I don't know when that moment will be. I dunno, hope I helped LOL.

O1QBA5XSaa	Percentage-wise, there are more as Cub Scout leaders, sweet pea.    Married men, usually.    Grow up, romophobe.|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	For the same reason there are a lot of pedophile day care providers.  They know where the kids are, and where they will be most likely to be trusted.    If I wanted to do something immoral and get away with it, the Christian church is the first place I would go to do it.  Blind trust from ignorant people is a powerful weapon.|`|lTx8Hoheaa	Actually, there is a much greater number of pedophile teachers and coaches than priests.    Pretty much any job which works with children will have some sickoes apply for the job. Christianity, however, just does a better job of weeding them out than most, but since Priests are held to a higher standard, the cases make a bigger news story.|`|QE77Oxtqaa	This is an unfair question.  The only reason it seems like there are so many is because they are the ones that get on the news.  You never will see "Father Stephen held mass today. Everything went wonderfully" on the 6 O'clock news.|`|2LsR22g9aa	Well I  think you answered your own question. You take away someones right to have sex and then surround them with kids that are easily manipulated. Its going to happen. They sum it up quite nicely in either season 2 or 3 in South Park when Father Maxi goes to the vatican to try and convince the Queen Spider to allow priests to marry.|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	But there aren't "so many pedophile priests". The John Jay study found that only 4% of priests serving between 1950 and 2002 were alleged to have sexually abused a minor, and 52% of those minors were teenagers, not children (pedophilia is about children, not teenagers).|`|ScmAk5EVaa	Media lies and hype a child is far more likely to be abused by a parent, family member, or a school teacher. Less than 1% of all priests are ever even accused and not all are guilty either. Their are treasure hunters about.|`|UH1ipgJmaa	I am not a Priest but trust me I have seen some Nuns who were 9.0 ratings|`|Z5KvRSRCaa	I bet you 50 dollars you have abosolutely no idea how many pedophile preists there are.    No, marriage is not a reason there are pedophiles, considering the majority of pedophiles and child abusers have normal adult relationships. Explain the amount of coaches, teachers, and regular joes that have abused kids, none of them were observing any kind of celibacy.|`|89MKzLl3aa	There are pedophiles everywhere. They get more attention if they are priests and teachers.|`|AA11622701	Why do many...    If you look at the actual statistics, fewer than 3% of all Catholics priest in the United States have had pedophile accusations brought against them.  (Why, yes, is 3% too many.)  Compare that to 15% of all school teachers who have had similar accusation made against them.  The number of medical doctors is also in the 13% range.  All according to FBI records.  Of those priest accused, more than 60% were cleared of any wrongdoing.  Compared to only 35% in the other two professions.      So the belief that there are "so many" is not supported by the facts.    As for the issue of priest marrying, I am sure that you realize that married man can also be pedophiles and rapist.  Plus last time I checked, nobody was allowing priest to marry little boys.  Just because you are not married does not turn you into either a homosexual or a pedophile.  So marriage is probably not going to make a difference in their desires.    So while it is a common arguement foro allowing priest to marry (and I personally think they should be able to), it does not have support in the facts.|`|AA11924289	it must have something to do with celibacy, i mean this is an unnatural way to live and not being helped by a good woman they may become twisted in some of their views.      people need an outlet for their sexuality, if they are not getting this outlet disasterous things such as pedophilia may result.    i just want to challenge you on what you mean by so many is it a numerically huge number like 100 million priests are pedophiles, or is it a case of one is too much and therefore many.  because percentage wise i am certain that it cannot be high, i just googled 'percentage of pedophile priests' and without going into the wikipaedia article, i noticed that someone had calculated the figure at 0.2%, which numerically speaking is a very low number.(any number is too high but you know what i mean)    in conclusion i believe that pedophile priests can be caused by celibacy or living alone, but not all priests should be painted with the same brush because statistically it pedophile priests comprise a very small percentage.    i wonder what percentage of the general population are priests, what if it is the same or similar?? would that mean that it is not just priests who have the same statistical probability of pedophilia, maybe then their lifestyle would not be a deciding factor and it could be that pedophilia affects people and being a priests does not affect this risk|`|eO2rnf7yaa	There is a much higher rate of pedophilia among non-priests than among priests.  It is also important to remember that most of the cases that people refer to as pedophilia among priests are not actually pedophilia.  They involve priests engaging in illicit acts with post-pubescent males.  Pedophilia involves sexual acts or attraction to prepubescent children.  The acts are primarily homosexual in nature.  One response to this problem has been a greater effort to exclude men with homosexual inclinations from entering the priesthood.   This does not mean that the Church considers all homosexuals to be molesters of adolescents.  Unfortunately, there is a clear problem of some homosexuals entering the priesthood and becoming molesters of same-sex minors.   Heterosexual molestations have been much less common.    Most importantly, the Church has started taking a much more honest and realistic approach to this issue.   The cover-ups of the past were a pitiful failure on the part of the Church hierarchy to protect people from being victimized.|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	Some are saying 3% or 4% but the actual number of Priest that have been charged with Pedophile is around 1% but either way the fact is how many of the accused are truly Guilty and yes there are those that are but how many accusers are lieing so they can scam for the money. In my sparsely populated area of the state of Kansas there have been 4 school teachers charged in the last few yrs and not one Priest but there has been Charges made against a Priest from the early 60's that died along time ago so all we have are a couple of people who believe he acted too friendly on scouting trips. But the way you asked your question was like Priest are the only ones to do it and Celibacy is a Promise a Vow and your saying Nuns are ugly looking is just more of your twisted thinking.Your question is insulting because you made all the assumptions of one willing to believe and spread a lie.|`|czf6uhIraa	So what was the point of asking?|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Cause they are sill living by the first commandment given by  God to Adam and Eve  .

As you can see, as long as people are unwilling to defend these innocent children, but rather shrug it off as "common" - young children will continue to be raped in the "church" setting.

They should be allowed famalies, they could relate to family dynamics more effectively and our church would flourish again..|`|L1HVLylMaa	Well, I was going to say something, but after reading the reasonable and appropriate answers that I have seen here, no need    I am pleased to see that people have a very clear idea of reality    A little addition. I have always wondered how the victims can prove that they were sodomized ( I don't say that some were not ) after many years. As far as I know, nobody leaves the penile print in the place where bad things happened    Besides, as somebody said, the Catholic Church is the wealthiest and most hated in the USA    It is my idea that when some cases appear, many other lawyers try to squeeze some money themselves and begin to accuse even their own mothers|`|bXeHr69Vaa	true statistics.  less than .8 of a pecent of catholic priests, of which most were of a homosexual nature   a proportion of defamation cases were against priests who are dead therefore not able to defend themselves, and against some who had already left the priesthood.   between 6 and 8  percent of teachers in the u.s.a. are guilty of the above, check out schoolteacher news .com and link scandals   i don't mind paying out to children who have been abused in the catholic system, the church was wrong in not looking into this when it 1st. surfaced and i am sorry for what has happened.as a father of 5 and grandfather of 11  i certainly hope and pray that they are safe|`|Ne9rXERpaa	Don't be childish.    Most likely, the paedophilia comes first -- they feel this attraction they fear is unnatural and know is illegal, and they think that joining the priesthood will give them the strength and isolation from temptation to deal with it.|`|2ogimlBxaa	Well, some are probably pedophiles who chose the profession because of how much they would be able to work with children.|`|awNQ0h2gaa	Humans are apes, give a human a million reasons not to act like his true self and he will STILL act like his true self.

When you deny someone their God given right to seek out a mate (apporiate age etc), then of course lust and everything in between is going to come into play. I don't think the human mind/body is capable of denying itsself what it needs/wants. If you starve yourself, you body turns on you and starts eating away at muscle tissue. Same thing with sex. if we deny ourselves sex, our minds will start going for kids, animals etc.|`|FGcwxZz0aa	Your theory is destroyed by the facts. Celibate clergy are the least likely of any clergy of being pedophiles. Married clergy are up to fifteen times more likely to be pedophiles. Catholic priests are less likely to be pedophiles than other clergy, teachers and family members. They may be the least likely of any group to  be pedophiles. Pedophile priest are the most likely to get press coverage. I guess because it is so rare. God bless!    In Christ  Fr. Joseph|`|AA11528489	The Reverend Soleil gives one answer, another answer is that some paedophiles actively seek out positions of responsibility where they have access to children. There is a similar tendancy among teachers, and so on, but with the lack of community trust invested in a single teacher, it is harder for them to get away with it.|`|0A7xLrz2aa	Pedophilia among priests in my predominantly Catholic country is a low percentage, practically unheard of.  Maybe they have more in the USA although I think the percentage to total number of priests is still small.  Also there are reports of American tourists who are pedophiles visiting here.  Pedophilia is not a Catholic or a clergy thing.  Maybe it is more of an American thing.    Homosexuality among priest here is also very low.  What we have more of are priests violating their vows of chastity, like priests who engage in sex *with women* even siring children, but again I think the percentage to total is low.|`|vciEtUcPaa	Probably the number one reason is the unbiblical practice of not allowing those in the ministry to marry.1st Corinthians 7:2- But because of the temptation to impurity and to avoid immorality, let each (man) have his own wife and let each (woman) have her own husband.When you follow unbiblical man made traditions and don't obey what the Bible says,there is going to be repurcussions!God knows what kind of lustful pressures will occur if you can't control yourself.If these priests were allowed to marry then it's possible that most of this junk wouldn't have happened.|`|zHle6Paqaa	This is what I think:  The Catholic Church should be held at a higher standard. As the record reflects; Less than one percent of our Priest have been exposed as pedophiles. That number is still unacceptable. However much less than other denominations, still it is unacceptable.    As one poster states, they think it's because they are celibate. Not so, I say. The statistics show pedophilia has no limits. Married pedophiles top the charts. All walks of life are subject. Where children...so will their predators.    There are scriptures regarding harming children. This would be a grave sin with severe consciences.    Remarking on Nun's physical appearance shows a total lack of maturity. Your entire question is shallow.    You really don't do Agnostics justice. Customarily, Agnostics are inclined to be "Deep Thinkers" that research before they dive in head first.    Sorry if I have offended you.

d05b366085d8773ec7654e3ad2b991cdaa	As to the final destination of Fred Phelps, I cannot with any certainty say, but he does seem to be heading off in the wrong direction.    Gandhi, on the other hand, lived a good moral life and is certainly headed to that place where God judges everyone out of the books according to their works.    God loves a good Hindu, or a good Muslim, a good Jain, Buddhist, Jew, Sikh, Rastafarian, JW, or Exclusive Brethren, etc, much more than he does a bad Christian.    If not, then God would cease to be a loving God, and he would cease to be a Just God, a lover of righteousness, and if love, justice, fairness, and righteousness were not among his divine characteristics he would cease to be God.    However, according to the Bible, those who die without knowledge of Christ, who thereby lack the opportunity to accept or reject him as saviour, are not automatically elected to go to Hell by default.      There are passages in the New Testament, and in the OT, that make it evident that those who have not heard of Jesus before they die, will be given the opportunity to learn about Jesus Christ after death, accept him, and "be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit."    In the writings of John, Peter, and Paul, etc, there is text enough to know that God IS  a loving Father to ALL his children, and will not desert those that otherwise have been disadvantaged by accidents of geography or time.     QUILL    .|`|tdNaZ9qAaa	God is LOVE therefore he did not 'create' any place called Hell.    If you study the differeance and the orginal defintions between the words  HELL , HADES, GEHENNA and SHEOL you will be amazed to find out that :      SHEOL and HADES means  'the common grave of mankind' and "the Grave "     HELL has been used as a replacement for the word GEHENNA which Gehenna was a literal place in Jesus day where they would take the trash from the city  and animal carcasses and those bodies of criminals and throw them in a ravine and they kept it burning with sulphur. A trash pit.    No where  in the bible does it say that God created Hell.  Check this article out for research    http://www.watchtower.org/e/20020715/art...    "what really is hell?"

And yes, the Bible says you have to obey the gospel of Christ to go to heaven.    Mar 16:15  And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.   Mar 16:16  He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.    Oh, and since you say Paul corrupted Christianity you are calling Jesus a liar because Jesus called Paul and said he would bear the name of Jesus to the Gentiles.

Yet I guess you ignore the ones that say our faith is not based on works (good deeds)     our deeds have no way of sending us to heaven, it's just on our faith alone and repentecne of sin.    we are declared righteous on the shed blood of Jesus Christ alone, and nothing else.    God doesn't send people to hell, He loves them enough to give them what they want.    People choose to sin and then say God sends them to hell.  yet they don't break the law and blame the police for sending them to prison, most inmates take accountability for their actions.   Why can't anybody else.    Salvation isn't based on where you were born either.|`|AA11382947	You sound like you are moving closer to the Catholic View.    We are not the ones that determine the salvation of others.    We can get to Heaven through Jesus without having ever know Jesus.

He does not want anyone to go to hell no matter what part of the world they live in.

Try not to think of the whole journey; Jesus said "do not worry about tomorrow, for today has enough worries of it's own, worrying cannot add a single hour to anyones life".  Maybe your trying to hard, maybe you want too much, maybe it just isn't meant to be.   I find solace in the words in red in the Bible, Jesus's words.

I ended up getting cornered by four of my family parental figures and they interrogated me for about two hours until I got sick of it and just told them. Then again recently my grandmother was questioning my relationship with my girlfriend. I had to tell her, again, about myself but I denied anything about my relationship just to spare the headache.|`|Vo6YukG2aa	my own stupidity.|`|3RQkgTSOaa	Mine was "pressure to disclose" which is common in LGBT people. I had read a lot of books about gay people and how they coped with it (Brian McNaught's "On Being Gay" is a very good book. I highly recommend it.) and I got a little tired of reading about how these people had freed themselves from the shackles of shame and guilt and self-loathing and the legitimacy of OTHER'S negative feelings towards gays. You know, I did not ASK to be born but I was and gosh darn it, I deserve just as much respect, self-respect and dignity as the NEXT guy. I was tired of dodging questions about why I hadn't met a nice girl or if I was dating any nice girls and living a life of self-imposed celibacy because I was afraid it would offend other people.    Don't get me wrong: sex was not the only reason I came out. The option to find someone with whom to spend the rest of my life is a dream that EVERYONE should be allowed to pursue. But I had to be honest with myself and the rest of the world before I could embark on that journey.    EDIT to Daoie: let us know how it goes.|`|W545hqrpaa	I came out before I was ever physically involved with a woman because in my heart i knew I wasn't straight.

I had friends that cared for me and I was comfortable with who I was at the time.  Of course I eased into it by telling people I was bi and no one held issue with it.  So a week later I was fully out as gay.      Of course if you ask one of my friends they would tell you I had come out six months earlier due to a leafy substance being smoked.

There's a long story to that actually. For months we were using Y!M as a way of communication (different cell phone provider so it cost us minutes). Anyways, we eventually got to a point that we started hinting to eachother that we wanted to say something.     We were describing our feelings as "different" and "probably not something others would feel good about". It went on for quite some time. One night, it got really intense and we just couldn't hold it anymore. But before anyone said anything, I just kept thinking to myself "I'm not sure what she is feeling but I really doubt it's the same thing as me. I mean really, what are the chances that BOTH of us are about to say "I'm gay"? That's impossible!"    A few minutes later, she comes out to me.     I'm in shock. She's in shock. I tell her "You are lying! NO! It can't be! Because that's what I was going to say!"    We have this huge discussion afterwards, and finally all the tension we were carrying just eased away. I'll never forget that night.     But what made me tell my mom was because of her. She told me that she told her mom one morning. This is what she did. She told her mom that I was gay, just to see how her mom would react. And seeing that she was okay with it, she made another reference to me when coming out to her mom:    "I'm just like Joey".     LOL I actually called her a ****** for doing that! Outing me out and saying I'm just like him! It was pretty funny though. But her coming out to her mom gave me the courage to come out to my mom that same day. I had been wanting to do it for some time but hearing that she did it gave me strength.     I came out to my mom shortly after. It was a disaster. LOL But it's gotten better. She's totally okay with it now. She's happy, I'm happy. Now I just need a boyfriend!|`|po4j4xhAaa	I was outed at 15, and I wasn't ready for the consequences.  I had planned to come out once I left home for college because I knew I could never go back again.    Once I was outed, I saw no reason to hide anything.  Even after I went away to college, a place where no one knew anything about me, I couldn't live a lie.  I've always been out, everywhere, to everyone who cares to ask or has a clue.|`|uLHCY6Qmaa	Well, I came out in 1974. I moved out from my folks' house to go to college. I always intended to come out then and intended to stay closeted through high school. I had it all planned out, and did it exactly according to plan. My plan was to tell my parents about it sometime during my college years, once I was completely on my own financially and safe from possible "abandonment". Turns out my Mom already knew, just didn't say anything. lol. My dad accidentally found out about it three years later. Although he had a strange reaction at first, it all worked out in the end.

sVClfrldaa	I'm with ya.  As a future teacher and a grammarian, I find it especially frustrating that children today don't know the difference between their, there, and they're; or two, to, and too.  In middle school, we had the Dirty Dozen, a list of these words that you would get laughed at and scolded for using incorrectly.  I hope that this trend doesn't continue.  I miss the good ol' days, when people know how to spell and knew the difference between certain words.  Now, the Internet is ruining people's orthography and grammar (yeah, punctuation!).  It's really sad.  :(|`|Y3KmwmjFaa	The difference between their, there and they're is not spelling.. it is grammar..

All my elementary school taught was white guilt, and there were like 5 minorities in total, out of like 500 kids. I had spelling tests till sixth grade, but I never struggled with spelling. I just think some people are naturally stupid, so you can't put complete blame on the schools. I really want to play those filthy liberals, though.    There is some group that wants to spell words by how they sound, such as spelling enough as 'enuf.' I personally thing 'enuff' would make more sense, but screw them. Viva the current English spellings!|`|Onzxe6ysaa	here's your answer...don't judge from y/a. people are backwards here.|`|19LHeUoFaa	Yes, we know spelling, but they do know emphasize those tricky words and really get down into detail.

ahS4TuSEaa	No. The body and the soul return to rest in the ground.  When the second coming happens, God's children's souls are resurrected and their bodies are transformed into eternal forms.    The other souls are resurrected after the 1000 year reign of Christ and all of God's enemies are defeated.

So if this should be true, then our souls shed the bindings of the carnal and are freed, FINALLY, and exist by the merit of how we have been while here on earth, in places corresponding to our earthly behaviour.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	We are not Egyptians.

Notice what Scripture says about the soul:    'The first man Adam *became* a living soul.' . . ." -- 1 Corinthians 15:45;  "Man came to *be* a living soul." --Genesis 2:7b     So, the soul *is* our body, not seperate from it.  http://watchtower.org/e/20070715/article...    . . . The hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment." --John 5:28-29      Reason on this:    Why recreate inherently bad people, just to judge them adversely, & kill them again?    John wrote in Revelation:    "I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened. . . And the dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds. And the sea gave up those dead in it, and death and Hades (mankind's common  grave) gave up those dead in them, and they were judged individually according to their deeds". --Revelation 20:12,13    This says that people will be judged, based on what is written in the 'scrolls', according to their own deeds.  In other words, they would learn God's requirements --many for the very first time-- & then be judged by whether they embrace & follow them, or rather choose to ignore & rebel against them.    How long a person remains 'asleep' in death, depends both on when in history they died, &, which resurrection they are assigned to experience.  For there *are* two resurrections, to *two* separate abodes, with *two* separate purposes that work together to glorify God.   But, even of those assigned to the first resurrection, many lie 'asleep' in death for hundreds of years, until the appointed time for it to begin.  That is also true of those who will experience the second resurrection.    "Death---The Only Remedy   - What Is Meant by Resurrection?   - Who Will Be Resurrected?   - Resurrection to Life in Heaven--For Whom?   - Who Will Be Resurrected to Life on Earth?    http://watchtower.org/e/20060315/article...    Those assigned to the first resurrection have their lives recreated into spirit bodies, instead of flesh & blood.  These are chosen to rule alongside Christ (also as king-priests of God) in God's heavenly kingdom,  which will bring both Earth & Humanity to perfection.  This resurrection begins *after* Christ is enthroned as king, & the kingdom is set up to begin ruling in heaven.  Some of these are still living on earth at that time, & when they die, are 'changed in the twinkling of an eye' into their new spirit-bodies. http://watchtower.org/e/20080101/article...    Those assigned to the second resurrection will be recreated as flesh-&-blood humans again, & will be subjects of God's heavenly kingdom.  http://watchtower.org/e/lmn/article_09.h...   This second resurrection occurs at some point *after Armageddon*. http://watchtower.org/e/20051201/article...    There will be those who will not be resurrected at all, because they knowingly & willfully chose a course of life that worked against God.  Such ones will simply remain nonexistent, forevermore.  Like adamic death, the common grave of mankind, & Satan the devil, these ones will have no future existence.

The truth is, truth doesn't come in a package. If it were that easy what would be the point of a lifetime... of permitting life to continue after knowledge was taken from the tree. It is a trial, not of your moral fortitude as prescribed by men, because that is subject to change as men do. The omnipotent, omnipresent, the infinite, if you ever want to know that you have to pursue it. By definition it is in everything. People will make you fear god, tell you you are going the wrong way, but the bible says not to follow the crowd, but to follow god. The judgement of your life is provided by the conscience he gave you. If it is heavy, your life will be misery and you will hurt with guilt, if it is not... you will find happiness. Don't waste what he gave you if you appreciate it, wait until your dead to find answers and you will have sealed your own fate through your lazy presumptions.       (This might sound like arbitrary nonsense... it's an attempt to explain how you pursue knowledge and thus understand and come to terms with this God, even if you fear god for doing it (which the bible says you will), because lazy content and self preservation with the assumption someone will just hand you heaven if you don't break any rules -the bible says- won't get you there.)|`|IyqyJ82Eaa	Neither|`|DDFgKxcaaa	None of the above.|`|AA11592327	Your life force might come back to earth in a new body.

John 11.|`|AA10052130	Disregarding your confusion over the distinction between 'body' and 'soul', and assuming you mean spirit, according to the Word of God, when we die, the body rots in the grave, and the spirit is kept by God for the day of resurrection.  Ecclesiastes 12:7 -- Then the dust [our bodies] will return to the earth as it was, And the spirit will return to God who gave it.    A person's spirit is NOT alive or conscious, but (as Job, Jesus and Paul put it) sleeps in the grave (not heaven or hell), awaiting God's call to resurrection.  Ecclesiastes 9:10 -- Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going.    Job 14:10,12,14-15 -- But man dies and is laid away; Indeed he breathes his last And where is he? ... 12 So man lies down and does not rise. Till the heavens are no more, They will not awake Nor be roused from their sleep. ... 14 If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait, Till my change comes. 15 You shall call, and I will answer You; You shall desire the work of Your hands.    Job was speaking of the resurrection.  Notice that he was not in heaven or hell while he waited, and not alive.    Ezekiel 37:12 -- Therefore prophesy and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord God: "Behold, O My people, I will open your graves and cause you to COME UP FROM YOUR GRAVES, and bring you into the land of Israel.    The resurrection is from the GRAVE, not from heaven or hell.    So, when is the resurrection?    Firstly, realise that there are two resurrections: the resurrection of the just, and the resurrection of judgement:  Acts 24:15 -- I have hope in God, which they themselves also accept, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and the unjust.    Hebrews 11:35 -- Women received their dead raised to life again. And others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.    John 5:28-29 -- Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice and come forth--those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation [judgement, as other translations correctly have it].  {Note also that the dead are called out of their GRAVES, not heaven or hell.}    1 Corinthians 15:51-52 -- Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed--in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, AT THE LAST TRUMPET. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.    1 Thessalonians 4:15-17 -- For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain UNTIL THE COMING OF THE LORD will by no means precede those who are asleep.  For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and WITH THE TRUMPET OF GOD. AND THE DEAD IN CHRIST WILL RISE FIRST.  THEN WE WHO ARE ALIVE and remain SHALL BE CAUGHT UP TOGETHER WITH THEM in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.    Notice that the resurrection of the just, those who are in Christ, will not occur until the return of Jesus Christ.  And both the dead and the living saints will be raised TOGETHER.    Revelation 20: 4,5d -- And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was committed to them. Then I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. ... This is the first resurrection.    And what about the rest of humanity; those who are not in Christ, who died without ever knowing God, Jesus or salvation?    Revelation 20:5a-c -- But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished.    Revelation 20:7,11-12 -- Now when the thousand years have expired,...  Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. And there was found no place for them.  And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books.    This is the resurrection of judgement.  All of humanity, who have not known the one true God, will be raised to a second physical life, and taught the truth from the Bible (the "Books" that were opened) and given their chance to be "changed from mortal to immortal."    And is the resurrection to immortality in the flesh or in the spirit?  John 3:6,8 -- That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. ... The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit."    1 Corinthians 15:42-44 -- The body is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption. It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.    So, those in Christ, true Christians, will rise at the return of Jesus Christ. They will be born of the spirit, and they will be spirit. The rest of the dead will rise bodily, and offered eternal spirit life, at the end of the 1000 year reign of Jesus Christ and the saints upon the earth.  .|`|Yc6wSOuSaa	Your sould is resurrected not your body.|`|176PIYNVaa	No.  No.  No.  No.|`|uZdgOHkPaa	Your soul is returned.|`|DbyvTE4laa	ur spirt is|`|hhRfvQc5aa	idk|`|IWtHxOrSaa	this  is a totally ridiculous idea when you die you are no longer a person you are a piece of meat with nobody home dead is not a state of mind|`|NYd9yi2Eaa	if you want a Christian answer:    most Christians agree (some differ) that when a person dies the inner person (spirit man) and the soul (mind- cognizant awareness, will, emotions) is separated from the body.    the body goes into the ground (if not lost at sea or otherwise destroyed).    if the person is a believer in God, then the spirt and soul go to heaven.  if the person doesn't then its believed that they go to hell. like a criminal goes to jail.    at a specified time for the believer, the spirit man + soul will be reunited with their body and become "glorified" healed or fixed from whatever flaws and be immune indestructible everlasting.    it is believed that the unbelievers will be reunited with their bodies, judged for their "crimes" then be sent into "outer darkness" (i'm not sure what that is exactly but at any rate i dont think its anything good to look forward to)     the specific time for the believer is "at the rapture of the church" (there are many differing views of when it will take place)    for the unbeliever it will be at a later time, at the end of the "millennium" when Jesus physically reigns on the earth.      if there is something that you disagree with concerning this information, then continue on with your life as usual. but i think that anything you say or do can and will be used against you in the heavenly court of law when all will stand before the Judge of all mankind. so be sure to get yourself a good afterlife lawyer.  .|`|27seDlqcaa	There is no reseraction.

AA12248887	It seems so impossible because it is like trying to carry water in your hands through a desert. But every drop counts.    Most third world countries have been run by currupt administrations for so long that it is considered natural by their citizens. When organizations from the developed world try to help, their efforts are worn down by the system. It might be war lords controlling the borders demandng a part of the aid or taking everything and selling it, be it food, water, medication or spare parts. Or perhaps it can be as simple as sending perishable goods to areas that are still in danger from flooding or too distant for the goods to arrive.    Help has to come from the inside. Simple solutions for the third world to help itself and protect itself from greed while it does. Low tech answers must be adapted to the needs of each people. Creating a flexible infrastructure that can be adapted to local needs. Finding the right leaders, local or religious and managing to get the help to them before self-interested big-wigs find out is a tall order and too few people have the stamina to do this over large areas during the long years that it takes to make a lasting change. Building communities that keep their heritage and their values but are open to learning new ways is hard work. Keeping the new ways "pure" and free of the bad influences of society is tough. Notice in how many places people might be dying of hunger and illness, but cigarrettes still get through. If only the power of good had the sneaky resilience of evil.    Teaching villages how to dig water wells, how to use drip irrigation and simple yet improved tools that do not require gasoline or spare parts, educating the young so that they may build a better informed next generation and not be the victims of tribal hate, helping them help themselves out of the hole we think they're in.    Because part of the problem is that too. We still want to impose the improvements of the civilized developed world on people who might just be happier if we took ourselves and our wars and post-colonial interests away from them.|`|M7YbFvWuaa	The unequal distribution of money. There are fantastically wealthy people who could easily make a dent in starvation, they just don't.|`|DkwgogXZaa	lack of infrastructure.  the ones that do to come to power get paid and leave.|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	Because some in poverty feel its their 'destiniy' and life to be poor. Others want out and circumstances do not allow them out of poverty.|`|U8oR3VU6aa	Cause most of that sh**i*te is a scam. We have starving people in the US but nationally we are thought of as having too much. We have deserts and homeless and 'bag' people too, but we don't focus on them and televise it. Maybe because of pride. But 'they' zero in on an area and make infomericials about it and if you watch closely they have been showing the same faces and places for decades.|`|LxpUY1GTaa	Because 1. They do not use birth control.                2.They are controlled by leaders who do not consider any one other than themselves.                   3. If financial aid ,or even food aid ,is given by the first world then it is appropriated by the leader and his cronies.         Unfortunately the only solution is sever sanctions, but then rogue nations, such as China ,will still trade with the leading party.
WAoNhHB1aa	They put too much detail in it.  Like if you asked somebody "Where were you at 8 o clock yesterday and what did you do?"  If they were being truthful, they might say "At McDonald's, getting a bite to eat."  But if they're lying, they might get too detailed in order to establish an alibi.  They might say "I was at McDonald's on so and so street, eating a Quarter Pounder and fries.  Some sixties music was playing."  Almost as if they're trying to prove they were there by adding in some trivial little fact, when all you asked was where they were and what they were doing.    Also, they might try so hard to act normal that they end up acting weird.  They try to act like there's nothing odd going on, but they try too hard and it's very suspicious.  I don't know how to describe it.  But like, you know how when a guy's trying to act cool in front of a girl and he ends up making a total jack@$$ of himself?  Kinda like that.    And of course, as Faith said, if you ask them the same questions later, and they change their stories, that's suspicious.    Like Sami said, if they get all PO'd, then that would lead me to believe that they have something to hide.  Of course, they could just be a guilty person like me.  I don't actually do bad things, but I get all defensive anyway sometimes.    Don't rely on polygraph tests and the like.  Because that doesn't tell you if they're lying, it just tells you that they're nervous or not.  And I don't know about you, but if the police were questioning me, I'd freak out.  Especially if I didn't do it, because then I'd be scared that I might go to jail for something I didn't do.|`|7TQ5qGWcaa	Their mouth is always moving|`|X5hTmAkBaa	pants on fire|`|4fgcu7bAaa	Someones nose going very long.|`|OZjlW5utaa	Smelling smoke because their pants are on fire.    lol OK.

eshummTJaa	Those who follow the Bible and the word of God worship on the Sabbath as the Ten Commandments indicate.       Many church's have remembered the Sabbath truth and have returned to the Holy Day of Worship as God indicated and created....    If they must wait for a sunday pastor to finally comprehend the truth of the Sabbath both the congregation and the pastor are lost in their ignorance.    The blind leading the blind...|`|WbJPQM1naa	It's doubtful.  I wish more "sunday" pastor would begin to teach the truth of the REAL set apart days which were ordained in Torah for ALL.  But like the first poster, most seem to think that since they believe in Jesus the Christ, they are no longer bound by the traditions of the OLD covenant.      I am learning in my own time and seeking YAH for my answers to HIS will for me in every part of my walk.  Maybe we can pray together that more believers would be open to the truth of the Torah living and the TRUE sacred names and the TRUE set apart days and ways to give HONOR to YAH in them!    I don't think this change you seek will come easily or even soon.  But, we can continue to pray for it.|`|IhIyQoF4aa	most of them wouldn't, in a Baptist church where it's very congregationalist the Pastor would be fired.    but then again, sometimes we need to step back and stand in awe of Yahweh's power.    Elijah the prophet who should have known better thought he was the only one.    1Kings 19:13-18  And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. And behold, there came a voice to him and said, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"  He said, "I have been very jealous for Yahweh, the God of hosts. For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword, and I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away."  And Yahweh said to him, "Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus. And when you arrive, you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria.  And Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint to be king over Israel, and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint to be prophet in your place.  And the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu put to death, and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha put to death.  Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him."|`|shU6AeFeaa	well if they ever taught truth in church there would be mass hysteria|`|bsyeJmqIaa	They can't even accept the truth about the heathen christmas tree!|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Not sure from what perspective you are speaking, as the bible teaches let no man judge what holy days you keep.

The letter of the law or the Spirit of the law|`|UujliMsCaa	What change would that be?    I do preach the truth of the Sabbath. I preach that Saturday is the seventh day and the day of rest and that Sunday is the day that the early church (that I am not even a part of) decided to do "services". Services are not "the church" or "the Sabbath". It's just a time we can get together and enjoy fellowship and the love of Christ.    I have no problem with believing that I need BOTH a day of rest and relaxation AND fellowship and community worship.    I enjoy my Sabbath and my Sunday services :)|`|AA10471892	Their truth and your truth collide like a train wreck.    All too many of them are focused on a letter of the law mentality even as you are, and at that point, it really doesn't matter what the point of law is, seeing as either way, the focus is taken off of the new covenant law of faith and the spirit of the law.|`|0vmQNf0oaa	They teach the truth that there is no Sabbath or holy day in the New Covenant. You are free to meet any day of the week to worship and should rest in Christ every day.    Col 2:16 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:   Col 2:17 Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.    Rom 14:4 Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.   Rom 14:5 One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.   Rom 14:6 He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.|`|kXhAERt3aa	No - people do what they want to do.|`|YzlXHNkjaa	It would cause mass confusion in the Christian world.

Some people choose to observe it Saturday night.. if you READ THE BIBLE you would realize that a day actually starts at night in biblical terms.. It's right there in the first part of Genesis...     Genesis 1:5 God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." And there was evening, and there was morningthe first day.    So stop with your "Saturday is the real sabbath" stuff because its tired and annoying. Someone should have taught YOU about the sabbath....    Not to mention that as Christians we are not suppose to observe holy days as the law states because we are no longer subject to the law.
Fdo2G5BZaa	I am of the belief that those of The True Church who keep the Sunday service will be short a reward or two in Heaven... not keeping The Fourth Commandment will not keep any one out of Heaven... but I am certain that God would still prefer that The Sabbath be kept as He intended it to be...|`|AA11648578	There is no such thing as a Sunday keeper. The Sabbath is the seventh day and this day of the lord is fulfilled by Christ. The seventh day is yet to come but this day we have by faith. He who accepts the atonement has by faith entered God's rest.  Please study the meaning of the Sabbath rather than ritualized God's word.    Hebrews 4:  1 Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.     Mat. 11:28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.       2 Peter 3:    8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.     9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.|`|dL82oSHTaa	If they didn't know better, like mother theresa, I do think will be in heaven one day even though she was catholic.

AA11002471	God observed Abraham and found him to be a righteous individual.  God made Abraham a promise:  "I shall make a great nation out of you and I shall bless you and I will make your name great; and prove yourself a blessing."  Genesis 12:2  That 'great nation' became known as the jews.|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	All land is holy since you are part of that land and came from that very same land that means you are all holy.|`|AA12245463	It's not that God chose the Jews, I'd say it's more accurate to say that God "made" the Jews.      I Samuel 12:6   "And Samuel said to the people, "The Eternal [is witness], the One who *chose* Moses and Aaron, and who brought your ancestors out of Egypt."    Commentary from Plaut's URJ Torah:  "*Chose* Literally, "made." The Hebrew word, Asah, is the key word in God's creative process. Israel exists because God *made* something of this people!    Each person witnessing revelation at Mt. Sinai received God's instructions (Torah) for how to live according to God's wishes.  The Covenant received at Mt. Sinai includes the 613 Commandments which encompass the obligations of all Jews.  Those commandments were never meant for non-Jews, but it's through those commandments that the rag-tag people fleeing from Egypt became a mighty nation.    Everyone at Mt. Sinai accepted God's offer by declaring  "We will DO" before declaring "We will HEAR."  In other words, they accepted God's offer before ever hearing the terms of the contract and the 613 commandments.       "We will DO!  We will HEAR!"  .|`|TkUF1PI4aa	Maybe b/c Jesus was a jew.|`|4BQXYxPYaa	Perhaps they with the potential to become such.|`|VxrsfAfyaa	Actually, I think they chose themselves.

God didn't want to pick a "powerful" nation because they could say, "We made it to the top on our own. . . . "    God wanted to pick the weakest, smallest group. . . . so when THEY prospered . . . the only explanation was . . . "GOD moved His hand."

The apostle Paul answered this in the book of Romans.  Understanding the truths found in chapters 1-3 and 9-11 should put this together for you.    First, in Romans 1-3, Paul describes the Adamic nature of man.  The tree of the knowledge of good and evil produces two distinct fruits in men.....those with knowledge of good become self-righteous.  They try to live "right" by the rules and regulations, but because they possess the same fallen nature as Adam, they become judgmental, condescending towards others, and they try to manipulate and control others through their "righteous" requirements.  This is what happens to religion when unconverted men become leaders in the church, and this behavior is exemplified in the scribes and Pharisees as we see in the gospels.    The other Adamic response comes from the knowledge of evil - those who revel in perversity and darkness and death.  The wicked and the unrighteous.  They don't live by any restraints of the law....they actually celebrate perversion and evil.  We don't have to look too far for any examples of this.  Turn on any television show, video game or movie....or look at what is happening in our society.  Evil is prevailing more and more, just as it has been prophesied through the Word.    In Romans 9-11, we see Paul using two groups of people to represent these two responses of the tree of knowledge - the self righteous and the unrighteous:  The Jewish nation represents the self righteous that live by the law.  Paul describes them as having a zeal for God, but without any knowledge of God.      Gentiles represent all other pagan nations who are not Jewish and are not under the law.  The especially wicked and unrighteous who don't even bother to seek after God.    Okay - now we're getting somewhere.  A foundation has been laid:  In our Adamic condition, men either try to be God-like on their own, or they don't even bother to seek after God.  They could care less if He even existed.    Since man has been given dominion and authority in this earth, and was initially created in God's image with the freedom to choose - how is God going to penetrate such hardness of heart to draw men back to Himself?    The answer to this question will also answer yours.  God in His foreknowledge knew that the Jews would reject His Son and thereby reject God, so He chose them to receive the ordinances and the gospel message first BECAUSE HE KNEW THEY WOULD REJECT IT.  Their rejection of Him in turn opened the door to the Gentiles, WHO WOULDN'T EVEN SEEK GOD, to hear and receive the Gospel.      The NATION of Jews will not be converted until the end of the 7 year tribulation, but they will become jealous of those who were formerly Gentile and are now in Christ....and they will return to the gospel they had previously rejected.    Of course, sharing this truth with you will earn me alot of thumbs down I'm sure.  It is a very offensive message for the Jews, and there are many Christians who have never read these Scriptures and are unfamiliar with this doctrine.    However, if you consider the Apostle Paul writing under the unction of the Holy Spirit to be a reliable source, AND you allow Scripture to interpret Scripture instead of listening to men that have misinterpreted or perverted Scripture, then what I have told you here is true.    God chose those who would seek after Him but refuse to know Him - in order to reach those who would never even seek Him - to ultimately open the door again to those who had previously rejected Him.           No wonder Paul was overcome as he shared this and talked about the infinite wisdom of God and the depth of knowledge that far surpasses our understanding!    It sounds complicated, but it all comes down to this:  How God, whose gifts and callings are irrevocable - could allow men to maintain their authority and dominion in this earth, and yet still penetrate the hardness of heart against Him which is now born into our nature...thanks to Adam.  But a glorious new nature can be born into us now - both Jew and Gentile - thanks be to Christ!|`|bF4HAvsZaa	God "fell in love" with Abraham and blessed him and his descendants. Just as with all love, others may sit around and say, "What does he see in her?", but love is love.  The Jews were chosen to bring Law and the word of God into the world. For this, they are despised by many.|`|gGmMw2vDaa	The jews created the god that then made them the chosen people. Jesus, I wonder how that could have happened.
JI7NQ9TNaa	I think Miss Manners would suggest that you look them in the eye and say "Why thank you for your concern."    Add a frosty tone if you like.|`|0WstfAmzaa	That's tough.  I'm sorry that your little girl has to deal with such a condition, and then on top of that, people are rude enough to try and tell you what you are doing "wrong'!    I would just say something like, "I appreciate your concern and I will think about it."    IF they keep going on and on, then say, "Again, I appreciate your concern, but she is my child and I am sure her mother and I will be able to decide the best approach."  Then ask a question that re-directs the conversation to another topic.|`|14pjwQPLaa	Just politely say, "Thanks for your concern, but we are following our doctor's advice on this."   That tells them that a) you know it's a problem, b) it's none of their business and c) it alludes that it MIGHT be a medical issue, but it's not up for discussion.    If they continue asking, just look at them, puzzled and say, "Why is my daughter's toilet training so important to you?" That usually shuts them up.|`|ovgxECKsaa	I have been in your daughter's position.  I too had the same birth defect and spent the first 3 years of my life on antibiotics for ear infections and sinus infections due to the bacteria backing into my system.  I also had alot of accidents.  My mother was not as understanding about them as you are with your child.  Finally when I was 3 1/2 my father insisted my mother take me to another doctor.  The new doctor correctly diagnosed my issues during the first visit and sent me to a good urologist.  The defect was corrected surgically very shortly there-after.    Unfortunately, people are going to judge you and tell you how wrong all your potty-training methods must be for your 2 1/2 year old to still be in diapers.  They truly have no clue what your child is going through.  Just look these people in the face and say "She has a urological birth defect that is being treated and until it is resolved she does not have bladder control and must wear diapers"  Be sure to emphasize the words 'birth defect'.  That will usually halt further criticism from everyone.    On a note for your daughter - make sure her experiences at the doctor's office are as pleasant as possible.  If any staff member in any facility treats your daughter with anything other than the upmost respect and don't make sure that any and all procedures are done with the least discomfort and most modesty possible, send them away and request another person.  You are your daughter's best protector and advocate.  Make sure she is emotionally nurtured and never lied to about any procedure's pain and discomfort level.  She will remember all of this when she is older.  My mother did not do these things for me and to this day I hate going to the doctor.  I cannot tell you how many times I heard the words "this won't hurt at all, it will be over in just a minute" and found this to be totally untrue during extremely painful and long lasting tests and procedures.  I have since found out that often they had used adult sized instruments with me when they should not have AND that several of the tests I underwent they would have anesthesized an adult for these same tests due to the pain level.    Don't ever let any medical staff forget that just because your child is young and small that she can feel everything and will remember it.  It is worse for her in fact, because she does not yet understand why these people are 'torturing her'.|`|VMY7No0eaa	just say THANK YOU FOR SHARING...

Wiccans believe in a "Lord and Lady" an amalgam of many pagan deities.|`|bgA9wLD0aa	the wiccan god and goddess represent the male and female principal.  some wiccans believe that all gods are one god and all goddesses are one goddess, in which case pan would be one aspect of the god.  some wiccans are hard polytheists and have specific male an female gods, and some see them as no god or goddess in particular.    the core belief is that there is a balance in nature between masculine and feminine energies; different wiccans express this belief differently.|`|kXhAERt3aa	Wiccans worship a number of gods and/or goddesses. either monotheistically or as pantheists.  Pan, who is connected with Bacchus was one god who was singled out to be portrayed as Satan in early Christian illustrations, because the worship of Bacchus and Pan was still very extensive back then - as vernal gods they were major competitors for early Christianity.  But Hestia, Diane and others are also very prominent in Wiccan faith as well as Helga from the Norse myths.  Some Wiccans also are spiritual faith holders only - they do not have a specific diety in mind, they simply believe in the power of nature or the earth and work with those.  Wiccan beliefs are really varied, though some call themselves the "real" Wiccans and maintain that their version is the only true path.  Then there are the Pan followers who are not Wiccan - Paganism is much larger than Wicca alone.|`|24H5tznkaa	In addition to the wonderful answers you have already gotten, Cernunnos is also known as the horned God.

Witches aren't cool...not real witches.|`|07kMcIeSaa	depends on the personal beliefs of the individual wiccan you are talking about. there are many different beliefs in the wiccan faith, and many different Gods and Goddesses associated with those beliefs, i'm sure some do worship Pan, while others don't, and some probably worship him in addition to others. it all  depends on who you talk to|`|1lRlNIelaa	Not necessarily. He can be just the "Horned God" but those Wiccans who feel more drawn to the Greek Gods or those who have a hellenic influence in their paths portray the Horned God as Pan.|`|Lk4aCBACaa	He can be, but not for every Wiccan. :)    A lot of Wiccans go by the idea that all gods are one god, and all goddesses are one goddess, but they can be seen in many different ways and be called by many different names. So it could be Pan to one Wiccan, or another god to another one, or both in differet circumstances.

The Bible states that we are sleeping. We stay asleep until Jesus comes again to revive all. He stated Lazarus was just sleeping (John 11:11, 12) and in Ephesians, it also tells us that the dead will wake up (Ephesians 5:14)|`|ncXMA6rsaa	No.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	Absolutely!  (No such thing as 'reincarnation' though.)  |`|DidciweAaa	Believing can be Deceiving.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	The truth is that death brings IMMEDIATE heaven or hell, depending ONLY on whether you believed the truth about Jesus in this life or not.     So to be in heaven and not hell, believe the truth about Jesus now! :)     Only faith alone in Jesus saves! Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|AA11103371	no.|`|LUGCxeuNaa	Having life after you've lost your life?  Doesn't make sense.

When I was little I believed in heaven.  When I was a bit older I still believed in some sort of ghosts or afterlife type thing.  Now that I'm older, the older I get the more I believe nothing much really happens but I still like to hold on to the idea that our actual energy goes out into the world.    I was in a coma when I was 20, and "died" several times when they took me off life support and I lost my vitals before putting me back on. I saw nothing. I saw no heaven or god. Nothing, it was just like going to sleep and waking up, without dreaming.|`|MfcTIdlraa	You betcha!  We just keep doing it over and over until we get it right.    That's when we can skate through a life without worries.    My mentally retarted sister had experienced all of her lives and her last was with us.

Romans 4: 24 But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; Romans 4: 25 Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.

People die.    maybe...they turn into animals.  maybe they just fall asleep forever.    but if they are animals, they cant tell you.  and there is no god.   and if so.  why is all these horrible things happen.    praying doesn't work people.  none of that **** does..      yes i believe..    Very strongly to be honest.
AA11826034	Well I had an awesome father who waited til he was 56 to have me & then took his time & raised me to be a woman who could benefit from his wisdom ...with that being said I think the most important lesson that he taught me was RESPECT for others but especially for myself.     He taught me that in order to be respected you must 1st give respect to those you encounter and most importantly to yourself. And by respecting myself I mean the manner in which i carry myself & how I deal with people everyday.|`|S6MqrWdjaa	To be honest i cant really think of alot lol.    My mom taught me about Jesus (thanks mom) and that lead me to be neutral (agnostic)    My dad taught me how to fish and if i was ever on survivor island i would surely not starve. hehe      I learned what a strong woman was from my mom, she always said whats on her mind and never backed down from opinions to please another. She worked her way through poverty as a single mom for  awhile and gave me everything i needed. She worked part time at my elementary school so i could get a private school education.     From my dad i learned what to watch out for. Him and my brothers taught me how to avoid men like them. Thanks to them i was street smart. Thanks to my mom i was book smart. I cant remember any quotes or any advice but i do remember what i saw throught their actions.|`|AA10182088	I learned that:  1) love is NOT in the form of a beating  2) that hugs DON'T hurt  3) that alcoholism IS a dangerous disease  4) that being an enabler IS a choice  and last but not least...  5) that you can overcome any obstacle with determination and faith and with that you can make better choices in raising YOUR children|`|CT61v9Rwaa	School wise all the basics were just a big help especially math, science and music. When I get to college i plan to work with computers in trying to create new sounds that can be used in like today's technology such as phones, toys etc. but more advanced and interesting.    Life wise i mean my mother keep me up dated on what to expect in like all types of situations like relationships, work, school, really everything and that's something I know I can pass down to my children. But some times adolescence got the better of me at times and there's a lot that I already knew from her, and i chose not to listen and eventually end up regretting it in the end.    I also was taught to learn to hang around people that had the motive to move forward in life and have goals that they were determine to achieve. Basically people with the mental state to be great. But then you have your child hood friends that sometimes branch off into the "wrong crowd."    Now I gotta question How do you let go of people like that? I mean if they doing wrong, I know I was told that they can bring you down even if you choose not to do what to do what they do. And I done saw it happen to a few. But what would you do put in that type of situation, reply when ever your free to.|`|AEqOczcCaa	That I can't hit other people and that I have to share because other people have feelings too.

My mom once told me "Let people hate you, don't respond the way they want you to.  Because sometimes a monster can create another monster and you'll be no different from them."  I've had fake friends in high school, they did opposite of what I was doing to succeed, and when I was acknowledge for it, they turned on me. I had enemies who were so ignorant about me being different from them, but I was taught to be myself and destroy them with kindness, not fight back and it worked many times.  People who hated me for the dumbest reasons had more respect for me.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	My parents never got annoyed with me asking questions. They are both smart people...and being like any child, I was always asking questions about everything, and they would always take the time to answer them. If they didn't know the answer, they would make a game out of finding the answer for me. So many things that I asked questions about this way, I will never forget the answers to. I was also taught from a young age that life isn't fair...and that I shouldn't expect it to be. I would have to just learn to play with the hand that I was dealt. This has helped me a lot through the years as well.

I believe I read that really turned bin Laden against the US was when Saudi Arabia asked the US to intervene in Kuwait.  bin Laden want to do that...but the Saudi's said no.  When the US set foot in Kuwait, that was the Infidels on Holy Land...and that is when they (Muslims) turned against the US.

As such, the people of the United States should not feel threatened by the differences in the Muslim culture, nor should they feel the need to change it to better suit American ideals.    However, I do feel that many in the United States do have a mindset that those of the Muslim faith are the enemy, or feel threatened by religious practices that they do not understand.    So, from the standpoint of the way things SHOULD be, I do feel that Obama's statement is correct.|`|VdifDUGkaa	we are only enemy to certain muslims, not all of them. since he is refering to them collectively the statement is correct.

Then We made him as a drop in a place of settlement, firmly fixed.  Then We made the drop into an alaqah (leech, suspended thing, and blood clot), then We made the alaqah into a mudghah (chewed substance)... 1 (Quran, 23:12-14)     Literally, the Arabic word alaqah has three meanings: (1) leech, (2) suspended thing, and (3) blood clot.     In comparing a leech to an embryo in the alaqah stage, we find similarity between the two2 as we can see in figure 1.  Also, the embryo at this stage obtains nourishment from the blood of the mother, similar to the leech, which feeds on the blood of others.3          Figure 1: Drawings illustrating the similarities in appearance between a leech and a human embryo at the alaqah stage. (Leech drawing from Human Development as Described in the Quran and Sunnah, Moore and others, p. 37, modified from Integrated Principles of Zoology, Hickman and others.  Embryo drawing from The Developing Human, Moore and Persaud, 5th ed., p. 73.)       The second meaning of the word alaqah is suspended thing.  This is what we can see in figures 2 and 3, the suspension of the embryo, during the alaqah stage, in the womb of the mother.     Figure 2: We can see in this diagram the suspension of an embryo during the alaqah stage in the womb (uterus) of the mother. (The Developing Human, Moore and Persaud, 5th ed., p. 66.)  (Click on the image to enlarge it.)              Figure 3: In this photomicrograph, we can see the suspension of an embryo (marked B) during the alaqah stage (about 15 days old) in the womb of the mother.  The actual size of the embryo is about 0.6 mm. (The Developing Human, Moore, 3rd ed., p. 66, from Histology, Leeson and Leeson.)          The third meaning of the word alaqah is blood clot.  We find that the external appearance of the embryo and its sacs during the alaqah stage is similar to that of a blood clot.  This is due to the presence of relatively large amounts of blood present in the embryo during this stage4 (see figure 4).  Also during this stage, the blood in the embryo does not circulate until the end of the third week.5  Thus, the embryo at this stage is like a clot of blood.     Figure 4: Diagram of the primitive cardiovascular system in an embryo during the alaqah stage.  The external appearance of the embryo and its sacs is similar to that of a blood clot, due to the presence of relatively large amounts of blood present in the embryo. (The Developing Human, Moore, 5th ed., p. 65.)  (Click on the image to enlarge it.)        So the three meanings of the word alaqah correspond accurately to the descriptions of the embryo at the alaqah stage.     The next stage mentioned in the verse is the mudghah stage.  The Arabic word mudghah means chewed substance.  If one were to take a piece of gum and chew it in his or her mouth and then compare it with an embryo at the mudghah stage, we would conclude that the embryo at the mudghah stage acquires the appearance of a chewed substance.  This is because of the somites at the back of the embryo that somewhat resemble teethmarks in a chewed substance.6 (see figures 5 and 6).     Figure 5: Photograph of an embryo at the mudghah stage (28 days old).  The embryo at this stage acquires the appearance of a chewed substance, because the somites at the back of the embryo somewhat resemble teeth marks in a chewed substance.  The actual size of the embryo is 4 mm. (The Developing Human, Moore and Persaud, 5th ed., p. 82, from Professor Hideo Nishimura, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.)               Figure 6: When comparing the appearance of an embryo at the mudghah stage with a piece of gum that has been chewed, we find similarity between the two.  A) Drawing of an embryo at the mudghah stage.  We can see here the somites at the back of the embryo that look like teeth marks. (The Developing Human, Moore and Persaud, 5th ed., p. 79.)  B) Photograph of a piece of gum that has been chewed.  (Click on the image to enlarge it.)          How could Muhammad  have possibly known all this 1400 years ago, when scientists have only recently discovered this using advanced equipment and powerful microscopes which did not exist at that time?  Hamm and Leeuwenhoek were the first scientists to observe human sperm cells (spermatozoa) using an improved microscope in 1677 (more than 1000 years after Muhammad ).  They mistakenly thought that the sperm cell contained a miniature preformed human being that grew when it was deposited in the female genital tract.7     Professor Emeritus Keith L.

Now how could he do that unless they were his to give?  see the point.    God had a hedge of protection around job and satan came to claim what (at the time) was his--authority.

According to the Bible writers as soon as God created Heaven with all the angels 1/3 of them were not one bit impressed with Gods beauty and holiness. They rebelled against him on the SPOT and became demons! IMHO this is a major glitch in Gods Creation story that Christians refuse to discuss! God was very busy creating the rest of the Universe and Hell to do anything about this rebellion right away so he scheduled to have all the rebellious angels evicted from Heaven and cast down to Earth along with Lucifer during the Tribulation Period after the Rapture? Some Preachers claim that this event will take place any time soon! NO WHERE in this humongous UNIVERSE there is going to be a single demon stranded anywhere in any other planet, but they will all be here on this Earth before going to Hell to be tormented with fire and sulfur for ever and ever along all sinners and those who never got to hear about Jesus! Praise the LORD! Nowadays, they commute back and forth to Earth    Revelation 12:9-10 (KJV) And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which DECEIVETH the whole world he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for THE ACCUSER OF OUR BRETHREN IS CAST DOWN, WHICH ACCUSED THEM BEFORE OUR GOD DAY AND NIGHT    So up to the end of the World SATAN and all DEMONS are busy DAY AND NIGHT blowing the whistle before God on the misbehaving Christians, especially on cheating Christian spouses and naughty teenagers! God is eagerly collecting information of their input on you DAY AND NIGHT!!! And he is never bored to this day!!! You can tell that Heaven is run by very low IQ aliens!!! Satan is very much respected in Heaven, too! (Jude 1:9)    It is a shame that not even one single Guardian Angel was available to watch over and protect Eve from committing an UNKNOWN EVIL like eating from the fruit of the KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL. The Bible writers claim that this fruit has the potential of sending the bulk of humanity that God loves so much to Hell prepared for Satan and his angels (Mat. 25:41). The Bible God let the fate of the whole human race at the hands of a woman! Eve learned that it was evil to eat the forbidden fruit of knowledge ONLY when her eyes were opened! It takes an all wise guy or GOD setting up Eve like that so the bulk of humanity ends up in Hell! The Bible writers say that God planned it that way before the foundation of the world (1 Pet 1:20)!    Later on, more angels banded together to quit Heaven in the days of Noah when they noticed that the girls from around here were "BEAUTIFUL" so they had sex and family with them (Gen 6:1-2)  This is a clue in the Bible that the male angels were created with well hung sexual organs, and that sex in Heaven must be very lousy or the female angels very ugly and prudish that they had to look elsewhere to satisfy their sexual cravings because GOD is not capable to keep all the angels happy hardly 1,000 years after the first rebellion...  So they had to look elsewhere and Christians pretend to be happy for all eternity in Heaven worshipping this same make believe God! Jesus will tell them how! The shrewd Bible writers say that without gullibility or FAITH it is impossible to please God! (Heb 11:6) They insist that they wrote the Bible as they were led by the Holy Ghost! In fact they claim that they didnt know what they were writing until they read what they wrote and were amazed! (2 Pet 1:21)  Most Christians hardly read the Bible and stop to think what they are reading! They let their favorite preacher tell them what Christianity is all about! The classical When we get to Heaven God will tell us all that we need to know is what makes Christianity so thriving! I went to Christian College and I honestly read the Bible in my Christian ministry for many years without paying much attention to what I had to discard, but I slowly went over the whole Bible again and it got me to the point that I had to shout, HOLY CRAP! It is amazing all the sh*t that a Christian must believe to go to a place that doesnt exist!|`|kO7xsy6xaa	You do not understand Job. God does not make deals. He allows the devil to roam freely.

In fact him I haven't even felt, at least my Gods are much more real.  EDIT: My theory for why they don't assume a physical form (since they are so powerful they could) is that such powerful entities assuming a physical form would fill the Cosmos with their bodies and the physical laws maybe do not allow such level of power to assume a physical/material form. It's something impossible that wouls defy the physical laws. These are my guesses. I do not know if they are right but they do seem logical. Note: Gods do not defy the Laws since the Laws are the basic structure of the Cosmos. Defying them would shatter the "balance" of the World thus eliminating it.|`|TEAaEXgJaa	Why haven't i seen yours?

Sometimes people believe only what they want to believe because they themselves would have to ...change.  And the "light" is not in them.      We want people to look at our lifesytle and say, "You know, I don't know what it is about..........., but I WANT what they have."      We are to be a lighthouse, the salt of the earth.  Set apart, a peculiar people.  We are not to conform to the ways of "this" world which is ruled by...Satan.    2 Peter 3:14  Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of Him (Jesus) in peace, without spot, and blameless.     Revelation is very clear.  Revelation 3:5  He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.     First he says, "He that ...overcometh."  That is a conditional statement.  Then, in order for someone's name to be "blotted" out, it first had to be written in. (think aobut that)    Please challenge them to read Galatians chapter 5.  At least once a day for a week.    The word Christian means "Christ"-like.

It's not a federal issue, it's a state issue. At this time there is no Constitutional amendment defining marriage one way or another, which means the federal government - and Obama - has no say in the matter, except to support a Constitutional amendment to outlaw it at a federal level. Individual states have the right to outlaw it if their voters choose to do so.|`|863D1b94aa	Nop..as I have read somewhere that Obama is against homosexuality!!|`|H2IqzG12aa	First, gay marriage is legal by default. It's only illegal when individual states ban it.  So, it's not an option (or necessary) for Obama to "legalize" it.  In any case, he supposedly opposes gay marriage, so it's not likely he'd be behind any movement to protect gay marriage through an amendment to the US Constitution.

Heart on the outside, spin on the outside, many things were wrong, or so the test showed.... when the baby was aborted, nothing seemed to be wrong.... and this was all done at a well known and reputable clinic I might add !!! the nurses who assisted said , and I quote and this OUT LOUD for the mother and father to hear !! * There is nothing wrong with this baby. She just murdered her healthy child*.... and yes, these were married people who wanted a child very badly... she was told the chances of having her own child were slim.... of course she did have another one a few years later, with many problems while carrying , but the baby was and is healthy !!! I went to the baby's funeral, first baby I have had to bury EVER !! and it was heart breaking to know that baby could have been born and probably been just fine.... To this day, the mom, is kinda in denial because of having made the choice to abort ... I nor anyone has EVER condemned her or said a word, we would NEVER do that..... but still it haunts us and I am sure her too in some way....and yet I have a neice that was told about the same things, she had the baby, he does have Downs Syndrome, but other wise is fine..... He is a blessing and a JOY !! sooooooo..... it can go both ways on what is the truth behind the TESTING !! but, I can understand the decision to abort *IF* after many test and more than ONE opinion shows the child will have no chance or the life of the mother is in danger.... I had to make the choice... but that is all I am going to say !!! go in peace...... God bless  *edit*- maybe abort was/is the wrong word here.... they induced labor , the baby was born, not alive of course, and we buried her !!! just wanted to make that point !!|`|59fZ25iDaa	I would let my wife choose to abort or not. I as a husband would like like to have both but given the choice I would go for the abortion. But ultimately the choice goes to the wife.

The Scriptures that you have listed above clearly says that Jesus Christ was sent by the only true God.  Most bibles don't name this "God," however, if you analyze you can see that Jesus and God are two different beings.  They are not one.      Also, I think that in many Bibles that do not say Jehovah, it has the word "Jah" in a few scriptures.  There is a really good one in Revelation.

Those that are spiritually dead also have eyes, but they cannot read. The Bible clearly shows that Jesus is the son of God as stated in 100's of verses from Genesis to Revelation. Jesus said that he was the fine shepard, his sheep know him just as he(Jesus knows his Father(Jehovah), and Jehovah knows knows him(Jesus). Jesus says that he(Jesus) surrendered his soul in behalf of his sheep(who did Jesus surrender his soul too?) John 10:14,15.  The spiritual dead can't see, their minds have been blinded by Satan(2Co 4:4). You can show them over and over again, but just as a blind man can't read, these blinded minds can't see.  2 Tim 3:1-5 said they would have a form of Godly devotion, but proving false to it's power.

Do you think He died for us in atonement for our sins, that He came back from the dead and He si now sitting at the right hand of the Father? Do you believe in His Deity and in His eternal nature?    If you answered YES, then you have confessed Jesus Christ as your Savior.    Now: Are you ready to live for Christ? To let Him change you from inside out, to submit your will to His? To start hating sin to follow His path? To stop loving the world to love God the way He loved you first?    If you answered YES, then Jesus Christ is your LORD. You won't be perfect or holy, but you will be transformed by His power.   And of course, you are forgiven: thinking any differently is NOT trusting God's power to forgive your sins and to call Him a liar.

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.

Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

Acts 15:14 has a fellow named Symeon saying:  "God has turned his attention to the nations to take out of them a people for his name".  God has a people.  Not everyone calling themselves Christian are necessarily part of that people.  Your responsibility is to find that 'people'.  Doing so incites God to forgive.  p.s. Knowing God's name is clue  1.|`|bOaqWNxRaa	Sure, you can do that if you like. Just remember that God loves you. He is more merciful than we think he is. You're forgiven if you sincerely asked for forgiveness, my dear brother. We all struggle with mortal questions. That includes yours truly!    Take care. God bless!|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	You will have to remember everything was created by him and to everything that was created will return to him.|`|33bcbefbc63a76a16260f6a1bd4246b1aa	God loves everybody, even us atheists, and we love Him back.|`|JxUFDutxaa	As an Atheist you are saying there is no God.  But if you believe there is a God, do you really think He would be happy with you turning your back on Him?    If what you mean is that now, you once again believe in God and want to know if He will forgive you for turning your back on Him.  Yes..He will. But you must ask Him for forgiveness..but only if you mean it. God is no fool..He knows what you truly feel in your heart.|`|xfYUxKmvaa	The Bible says these things have I written unto you that you may know. If you have accepted Jesus as Lord and Savior, then God has forgiven you. The Bible says that God forgets our sin when we are saved.|`|093b368d01bbdc03231061bf6fc4d520aa	Here's the thing about forgiveness.  You need to repent and forsake your sin.  In the scriptures it says that "even if your sins be as scarlet they will be made white".  Well if you do the wash regularly as I do you will find that the stain removers get the stain out but when they have to be applied repeatedly the fabric begins to fray.  Before you know it there are holes in it and it is not as nice as it once was even though the stains are gone.|`|2vUOqAikaa	If you have asked God to forgive you and meant what you were asking then God forgave you. However, if that still isn't enough for you, then perhaps having a pastor explain it to you would calm your worries.|`|Y4lA8S84aa	Just live your life......|`|hkvWDU3xaa	First off, we can't tell if God has forgiven you, he forgives those he choses to forgive. You really don't need a pastor for God to forgive you , but if you think you need to talk to somebody go to one. Make sure you pray to God and ask him for forgiveness.|`|SvwAADrVaa	youll have to believe yourself not a universal imagination ! i can believe dog and that will be the same|`|JkhB79V2aa	hey there,  I m a christian & I know for a fact that yes jesus forgives. IF you are a christian did you give your life to jesus by praying and asking him into your heart?  He died on the cross for your sins that when ever you commit a sin all you have to do is talk to jesus and ask for his forgiveness.  And after you ask for his forgiveness you are forgiven.  You can talk to jesus anytime he is always listening. You should get hooked up to a church to learn more about our wonderful jesus.|`|MoLIjdPuaa	First of all: what did you do that you need God's forgiveness??  Then: as I am not God, I can never be 100% sure that God will forgive me or anyone.   Final: I am convinced that God is Merciful, He created us human beings, so He knows us better than we do ourselves and understand what troubles us and why. So I believe that if you can forgive yourself, that you are 100% convinced that what you do is the right thing (and you could defend your point of view before God's throne), than He will forgive you.|`|Y0gujGtOaa	The Word of God says " confession is made unto salvation"   God is a loving God and YES! He will forgive you and not only will He forgive you but He (wants) to forgive you. If you will repent the word also says "He is just and faithful to forgive those who ask"   In Romans 1:16 in the amplified says this  "For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is God's power working unto salvation for deliverance from eternal death to (EVERYONE) who believes (with a personal trust and a confident surrender and a firm reliance, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.    Also, the doctrine " Once saved always saved" it is false. it is untrue.  Here is the scripture to back it up.  I Corinthians 15:2 ........." And by which you are saved (IF) you hold fast (AND) keep firmly what I preached to you, unless you believed at first without effect and all for nothing.   You can become unsaved but in order to be unsaved you would have to actually deny Jesus Christ!  Well I hope this helped you and as far as you seeing a Pastor goes if you feel like that will help you and you can get some peace from that go ahead. Be led by the Holy Spirit. If you feel that tug on the inside of you or hear that small still voice urging you to go then go ok.   God bless you.  ps.   God knows your true heart and if you repented and the word repent really means to turn and go the other way, then if you repented turned and asked for forgiveness in truth then do not be afraid, it is Gods pleasure to forgive you and welcome you as His child back home!!!!  Praise God! It is God's free gift to you, just receive it.

It's usually as profound as "spiritually speaking, do you prefer Coke or Pepsi?".|`|kDzaQC9waa	...sometimes|`|kNcQzZenaa	Both - this phrase prefaces many questions. Lack of creativity and love of dull repetition. How many times does a phrase catch on and it is repeated over and over, such as big bang for the buck. Most politicians are about as imaginative as a hungry dog. I guess repetition makes people feel secure - I don't know.|`|YOt6uTSzaa	Some people will ask a question that may not seem spiritual to some, but want others to look at it spiritually, so they add spiritiually speaking.....

But there is an answer.....I drink the water of eternal life....:)

AA11025703	I am a Christian, one of Jehovah's Witnesses.    No rudeness is intended.    Calling your local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses and letting us know you don't wish to be visited would probably be a good idea.|`|GxV4jGKMaa	You can put up a sign, or call the center.  Either should work.  Telling the individuals who come to your door won't work, because different people come all the time.  They really don't want to go where they're not wanted.  They should comply.|`|VMY7No0eaa	As one of JW's I find all of these comments funny.  We talk to catholics / hindu's/ agnostics. we call back on not at homes/ we talk to people in other areas too.  We are not doing it to be rude and A LOT OF PEOPLE like us calling and want bible studies.      We don't go into the same neighborhood every time so telling the person at the door won't work.    All you can do is ask if they will put you on a do not call list... however you WILL be called on to see if the same person lives there or if you have changed your mind.  and if someone doesn't know you don't want calls.    You might just listen to them about how the earth will become a paridise ... who knows you might learn something and like it or at least have a stimulating conversation or learn why things are such a mess on earth right now!|`|c8f2b08d3fd8fb61fb9b5b49572c858faa	tell them you are an apostate/disfellowshipped and they will back away from you like the plague. they are not allowed to have contact with ex JWs.|`|GqfiRXu3aa	Usually if you put a sign on your door that says, "No Solicitors" that keeps them away.  Otherwise, simply say, "No thank you" and close the door on them.    I've never understood those people.  Clearly their proselytizing is not appreciated by the majority of people.|`|IGhUA1Vdaa	I tell these people I already attend a church than name the church and let them know I am not interested.    The ones that used to come by my place were nice kids who would bike all over town in 100 degree heat in suits.    SO I felt I should be nice to them and they left me alone.|`|HLiUpl6baa	Hopefully they would stop if you just ask. I've had luck by being prepared for them. They are usually talking about 'signs of the end times'.    I quote Matthew 24 to them, using these verses:    36 "No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.     42 "Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.     44 So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.     I've found when you are prepared with a counter-answer which contradicts their premise, the visits are a lot fewer and farther between.    Good Luck!|`|AA11788494	Don't go to the door.  If you do just tell them thanks but I am not interested.  If you tell them you are Catholic they won't come back usually.|`|n7qcfWxkaa	I have put up a "no solicitors" sign, which sometimes works. Otherwise I open the door, smile politely and say "I'm not interested, but thank you and have a nice day." They usually go away after that, no hard feelings.|`|irLnPW4aaa	I either don't answer the door when they knock or I open the door and say "Sorry, not interested" then close it.    You can try calling the local JW Hall, maybe it would help, but I don't know.  Its worth a try at least.|`|rThIVk2maa	No need to post a sign, you can simply smile, say "no thank  you" as you close the door. Don't even speak to them, just treat them as you would any salesman, politely but firmly saying "no".
AA10067344	I can understand finding it a little patronizing, but the word is is not really a slur so I don't agree with the comparison to the n-word.    Essentially, it just means "southerner" (though it obviously doesn't refer to the southeast).|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	My step cousins are ex cholos, they say it all the time, it cracks me up.

4PQOiSfZaa	What do you mean by race system? Interracial couples have been around since the time of slavery. Masters would rape slave women and white women would sometimes fall for slaves. And the same goes for around the world. It's nothing new. Although it is becoming more prevalent.|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	I think cultural hang ups (not race) prevent more interracial relationships. Because we have people of mexican decent who's family goes crazy if they marry dominican or puerto rican decent. I love the beauty in different cultures, but those different cultures have their own way of trying to "keep their culture pure" just like some of the racist whites out there. Its just frustrating.|`|1OfLNwOPaa	get this clear,  Nobody is of pure race whatever,not even the chosen tribe.Even Jesus was a m9ixling of God and woman|`|AAgX0SDcaa	I think the system of classifying people by "race" was  political to begin with.  Anthropologists say that the Aborigines in Australia are most closely related to North Koreans.   I think families, culture groups, and even churches are more likely to discourage people from marrying others different from themselves.|`|rXhWL8pcaa	nope, family also puts pressure on their kids to get with people of his/her race (not all, but some).|`|LfIw9R0iaa	It's just silly to believe that people are subconsciously racist because of some system.  They are racist because of what they see with their eyes.  You could get rid of the system, things wouldn't change.|`|SBF6jqlLaa	I dont know if it would be any higher, because even without the system as is, ppl will divide themselves on some other basis; whether it be by skin tone, class, or what neighborhood you live in...ppl will find a way to dislike each other.|`|ZeFyWGOCaa	Tabulating race does not discourage people from marrying interracially. As long as there is racial discrimination, which there is, in health care, education, and employment, racial numbers must be tracked. Otherwise discrimination is impossible to document and prove.
ky3B42f6aa	The Bible itself is proof that there is no such thing as a "god-person".  It is full of so much illogical contradiction that this "god-person" must have been asleep when it was written, because he/she/it failed to proofread properly.  And, the New Testament is even a worse hodgepodge of errors and contradicting facts.  Mary and Joseph, for instance, are forced to journey to the wrong village (Bethlehem, as prophesied) instead of not having to go anywhere near.  In fact, there was no tax census ever recorded.  The Romans also never recorded a single word about some upstart called "Jesus".  The whole book is a fairy-tale fabrication from beginning to end.  Either that or, as I said, this "god-person" was fast asleep -- or maybe having a good time in the restaurant at the edge of the universe.  Editing and proofreading was certainly NOT done.  Such a "mess" could hardly be the work of a "god-person".|`|AA11265037	In a way, you are right. Why are there so many atheists? I'd say because they have been deceived  by the Father of Lies.     Why do Christian send out missionaries? I do not really know, because the whole world HAS heard of Christ, but our goal as Christians are to get as many people ready for his return, and some have only heard a watered down or completely mixed up version of HIS truth. Jesus preached Love, forgiveness and hope. So many churches today do not. Jesus also preached on the wages of sin, and again, today so many churches do not do that either.     The first part of your "question" seems more of a rant to me, so I will let it go. Plus I do not know what the exact verse is off hand anyways and would have to read the before, after and corresponding NT fulfillment of this prophecy in which you refer to give an intelligent answer.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	For the 3 people on the planet who don't know (Poster and two others) ALL the early Church was Jewish !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|WUjlEuTtaa	The God of Israel is known through Jesus Christ on a global scale...    Where have you been?|`|AA12346187	God  is   with in us  but its   up to us  if we accept him or not.|`|VzJQUCPIaa	I was about to agree until I reread the question and realized it did not say "Christians are constantly testy."|`|gmaCvh00aa	When Chrisitianity was in its early phases, they went through the OT and re-interpreted Jewish scripture to make it better fit their religion.    Examples are changing the snake in Genesis to a personification of evil and making the Garden of Eden story into a messianic prophecy, which it never was in Judaism.  Taking passages as you note from Isaiah and Jeremiah that were contemporary prophecies affecting Israel and making them into Messianic prophecies, when they were not seen that way by the Jews whose scripture it was.  Turning the character of Satan from an advocate of God into the personification of evil.  Making the Genesis curse of "your husband shall rule over you" into a rule instead of leaving it as part of one of the negative things that would happen now that sin had entered the world.

i4UeicOmaa	My boyfriends favorite thing to eat that I cook is lasagna :) On the side of every box of lasagna noodles, there is a receipe of how to bake it (consists of tomato sauce, cheeses, ground beef [or turkey]). It takes a little bit of effort and time to make the lasagna but it's well worth it. Throw some garlic bread in the oven as the side dish.     For dessert try baking chocolate brownies or his favourite dessert (cheesecake, pecan pie, etc.) and have some strawberries dipped in chocolate as well.    Good luck :)

And don't worry about keeping her entertained. After all, she's there to see YOU. I bet that's enough for her. Try planning a few fun things to do (like snowboarding) but don't jam pack your visit with activities. Give her a chance to make some suggestions. If she's new to your area, take her sightseeing. But the most important thing is to just let it flow naturally, and that includes sex. If you both want to and are comfortable with it, go for it! My bf and I had sex on our second date and we've been together for over four years. Only the two of you can decide whether it's the right time or not. Have fun and good luck!|`|Pqv8r29Gaa	That is not too much. Just do what you said you want to do. She will love it and you.

a1208f486df80a9010c503bf6d891c8eaa	You don't need to wear all black and young people tend to be given a bit of leeway in clothing at funerals as they aren't necessarily expected to have black dresses, black suits and black ties. But you should be aware that other people will be wearing black or sombre colours and anything that is bright - or has bright accent colours - will look very badly out of place. I would keep jewellery to a minimum, and aim for silver and white rather than gold or colours.    I'm sorry for your loss.|`|VMY7No0eaa	You don't have to wear black.  just something conservative.  you should wear a dress rather than slacks especially if it is in a church.  jewelry ok, makeup ok depending on the religion (southern bapt no) leather jacket ok or a parka ok... ok to wear into a church ...they know it is cold outside.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	the shirt and black slacks would be just fine. it would be fine to wear some jewelry but not like you were going to have a night on the town. makeup sure, of course. the leather jacket would be fine if it is full length and not a biker type jacket. no on the parka. other wise i would leave the jacket in the car. i am sorry for your loss.|`|rThIVk2maa	Dark, somber clothes. Jewelery and makeup are fine, just keep it toned down. The nicest jacket you have will do, just hang it up when you enter the funeral home and don't carry it about with you.     Keep it toned down, tell the family that you are so deeply sorry and don't say anything like "it's for the best" or "he's in a better place", they just need sympathy, not cheering up. These things should be fine in any faith.|`|3hkArqvbaa	I think the outfit you have picked out would be fine. Make-up would also be fine, as long as it's conservative (ie. mascara, neutral eyeshadow, blush, and muted color lipstick or something like that). Same goes for the jewelry. As far as a jacket, I would say wear your leather one (unless you can get another coat on sale at a department store maybe? a pea coat would be very nice for this occasion). I've been to a lot of Christian funerals, and everyone is basically dressed in something similar to your outfit.|`|579276f1a955ed5c170f87a86360c3b2aa	What you mention is fine.  I just want to say Im sorry for your loss.|`|R5UIMBvcaa	Black or any combination of black, grey, and white, with black accessories, would be fine.  However, I'd opt for a dress or skirt instead of slacks, and I'd leave off any color, as well as any jewelry other than pearl or black earrings or a religious necklace (if that's not irrelevant).  Makeup is fine if it's not too extreme or obvious.  As for a coat or jacket, unless the only ones you have are really bright, I think it would be OK to wear one of them and take it off just inside the church door.|`|14pjwQPLaa	Black is the traditional color for a funeral, but really, any darker color will do these days -- just avoid bright, sunny colors like red, yellow, orange, etc.  A few touches of color would be fine, like a scarf.  Take your jacket, by all means -- churches can be very cold, especially in the winter, and you don't want to sit there shivering through the service!  Yes, wear make up, and appropriate jewelry -- nothing gaudy or that screams "LOOK AT ME!", like noisy charm bracelets, etc.  Basically, you are just not wanting to draw attention to yourself.|`|8a4c030a7a44cd4edebe25c4141c6ddaaa	Im so sorry for your loss its tough.  What you described would be fine to wear.  And you dont neccessarily have to wear all black honestly.  Just dont wear anything wild or inappropriate as far as showing too much skin.  You could do like black slacks and a nice blouse...or sweater with color.  Keep the jewelry simple, and you can wear your jacket in the church if its cold, they will probably have a coat rack there.  And if wear your makeup the way you normally do, your friend would want you to be yourself.  I hope this helps.  And again Im so sorry for your loss.|`|yG46T1DVaa	This is more simple than you realize. A funeral is not just coming together because your friend died. It's actually coming together and celebrating the good life that he lead and that since he's a Christian, most know that he is in heaven right now. So even though it's a sad time, it's also a good time to know he is where he's supposed to be after you've lived your life; however short or long it may be. So, look at it as wearing what you think your friend would love to see you in. Forget about what anyone else thinks. You're going there for him, not them. Am I right? Sure respect everyone else, but to a degree. They will be too focused on their grieving experience which is normal. Wear their favorite make-up and jewelry on you. This is all about what he would like. If everyone would think that way at a funeral, getting ready wouldn't be so hard. Me personally would prefer everyone to wear bright colors and to play the song celebrate really loud. Afterward everyone is to go to a pole barn, get drunk and dance the night away. Why? because they are to celebrate the life I lived and I think I had a life to celebrate about. After all, we celebrated after Jesus died. Aren't we supposed to live life around him? You may not be a Christian, but I don't think you're totally ignorant of the Christian life as it lives all around you. It's embracing you waiting for you to uncross your arms. So go with your head high and don't be afraid to smile. A funeral is not that of a mark of an end of a life but a mark of a spirit going to a never ending life in heaven. It's fate. Accept it, and live your life the way you should to get there to be with him when your life is over. You won't feel alone then.|`|c696e17a151a058e36aceeab75aea544aa	black is traditional but it doesn't matter hun......not at all.......just make sure you go. I know you mean well but spend all that extra time worrying about what to wear and make dinner for the family or somthing.
PRbtcAHOaa	cause eye colour is all to do with genetics... there just happens to be a lot more people with the gene for brown eyes than green eyes in those area    interestingly, in pakistan the further north you go, i.e. the higher up the mountains, the lighter the eye colour. there ARE people with green and blue eyes in pakistan, but theyr mostly from the north    same with the hair i guess|`|iqNcXWsOaa	In DNA brown hair and eyes are dominant traits.|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	many indians got light hair and eyes....same thing with middle easterners    its because the countries are closer to the equator, its warmer so they got more pigments which results in darker skin and features|`|1a6b5775835f82ac17d81235f4026179aa	Actually,some do,northern African ie Egypt, Marocco etc. and Northern Indian/ Pakistani.

I mean they are far more superior then us measly ole Christians.    lol|`|UujliMsCaa	1. The flood was quite more than just rain. My guess is that at that time there was no vessel as large and sturdy as the ark and no other vessels were able to survive the violence of the storm.  2. If God wanted to destroy the earth, I don't think he'd let a few boats get in his way. I'll bet he could throw a couple lightning bolts in their bows.  3. You're asking Christians, who believe the Bible to be the inspired Word of God, infallible and inerrant to believe that God couldn't do what he said he did because other people had boats too?|`|M18zTiuvaa	Personally, I don't think the flood was worldwide. For Noah or the authors, the flood may have seemed worldwide, but their knowledge of the world was.....lacking. It makes more sense that the flood probably covered only that region.    But please remember that even though the Old Testament is included in the Bible, the writings are about Jewish history, not about Christians. As a Christian myself, I don't take those stories to be completley literal.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	Facts make my head hurt.|`|VxrsfAfyaa	Ask the Jews.  It is their story.

There was never before the Flood any other amount of water like it on the face of the earth, so other ships that had been made up to that point would not have been able to make it. I'm sure people tried, though--and probably had bloody power struggles over who was going to get on!    Plus, Noah's ark was on the open seas for about a year. Would anyone else have been prepared for that sort of time with food and clean water?     Great question!|`|OefOHgPFaa	dont forget the norwegians.|`|lHg9ZqwJaa	Stop asking such logical questions!

Jesus also said in  Luke 10:18: "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.|`|4Md06LoAaa	First of all, use spell check, proper punctuation, and take caps lock off. It's "devil" not "devile".

oVxr5B3Eaa	haha, i hope i'm answering the question the way you wanted it to...     But hey,,, Dinger.... soooo you know how you've liked Justin for like.. EVER, and you told me I wasn't allowed to talk to him... And then you guys had a fling... And then you guys stopped talking like a year ago.... But you said I still wasn't allowed to talk to him because you'd be jealous... Well, before you guys had that fling.... Me and him and a fling... and then after your fling was done... I got  back together with him. 6 months ago. And you had NO idea I was even talking to him. You completely forgot about him. Well I was seeing him behind your back. Then when we "coincidentally" met up with him and Jay at the bar and he stayed over and you thought he slept on the couch? While he actually snuck into my room. And then you were all B!tchy at me for awhile because I was in a bad mood.. I was really in a bad mood because I was feeling guilty I lied to you. Then you went on that date with Steve and you told me I "didn't deserve to know" what happened because I was so down.  So you took off for the weekend and went to your parents... and he came over and I said screw you and screw listening to everything you told me and you said I can't talk to him.. .why am I letting you lead my life... So I invited him over... And I ended up sleeping with him... and for some reason my guilt went away. So you came home from your parents and I was in a fantastic mood again and everything was happy.  And when he came over last week and you thought i was helping him with his computer? Well, I was... But that wasn't all... but I restrained myself because I thought you were downstairs listening.... but then after I found out you were actually in the shower and I was thinking I should have just went for it... .If you find out your going to KILLLL MEEE.... And likely not talk to me... Considering he came over that one time a couple years ago and I was wearing a skirt and he said "hey rachel.. nice skirt"... and you didn't talk to me for a week. So your not gonna like it.... I don't even feel bad about it.. Your seeing steve anyways.. So why can't I talk to justin? The worst part... I really don't think mine and his relationship are going to go far. he's a great guy.. but he just isn't ready to settle down into a relationship, but then again, i'm not sure I am either.

Well I do believe in something - God or Gods I don't know, but I do strongly believe there is something else, higher, mightier and above animal.  Why else live, why do most of us have a conscience, why not just murder each other, why is there a right and a wrong? I am not religious but I just have to believe in something "What" I don't really know, I call it God it's a name, it's easy, it's what we were told. I seem to get strength from believing in God and have many times said please help me God when I was in pain or lost someone dear to me. I heard unbelievers say that too, so why do they call on him if they don't believe. It's a theological question, and I am not equipped with a satisfactory answer but I say, let people believe what they want, the world would be a much happier place that way.|`|AfbjU9Guaa	Yes definitely, like a replacement mother figure.

In my eyes, most religions incite hatred and condemnation, such as Christianity/Islam and homosexuality. I have lots of gay friends and it really hurts when people make fun or persecute them. If God were real s/he wouldn't deliver this message to his/her people. I mean, how many wars have been started in the name of religion?    Love and happiness are the most important things in this life, and I wouldn't give them up for any deity.

I only wanted to know what was true and how best to live my life.  There are many times when it would be very convenient and temporarily satisfying to not be a Christian.    In some ways it's not comforting at all because we realize that we have a much better place in heaven, but we have to stay here on the earth until we're called home.   As far as the ignorant, that technically means someone who is unaware of certain facts, and if anybody here thinks they have all the answers to all the mysteries of life because with their finite minds they have been the one person to finally grasp it all, they are deluded,  supremely arrogant  and wildly ignorant.      I'm amazed when I watch science programs how many times the people interviewed will say "we think" or "could be" or "might have happened".  This view that somehow science has wiped out the mystery of life and explained everything is so far wrong.  Science doesn't even have all the answers to how the simplest cell in existence works.|`|OI7eeIreaa	Yahoo answers is the comfort blanket of the ignorant.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Ooooo!|`|DRSv6SOLaa	Bring on the "Banket"!!

That's why you have to choose to ignore such people and then it won't even be a thing|`|SBF6jqlLaa	I'm sorry, but after reading some of these posts, some ppl are convinced that racism is 'universal'- it's not...leave America for one moment, yes, their will always be some divisiveness for some reason or another...but not 'skin color'- this is predominantly an American issue that came about from whites during the Atlantic slave trade. Most countries, are so closely linked one to another that 'race' is not an issue, in some places 'race' is not even a term. Ppl have to get a better understanding of where the concept of race classification came from, then you will understand how truly ignorant it is, and the diabolical minds that caused it's poison to spread. If racists groups are growing it will be to their own detriment. No one is going out like that this time. These misconceptions about race are dieng among the intelligent- and recessive genes are dieng out as well.    UAO- I am aware of slavery among the different nations in the world, are you aware it was not based on skin color? but rather more political in it's origin? Race is a issue in the states more than anywhere else, and white Americans have demonized 'dark' skin, dark skin is more inherent in the other places in the world that also had slaves, so skin was not the uderlying issue. There is a difference in hating "back" and just being a "hater". So, when you say racism is inherent, it is due to what you know about your own people. I can say otherwise, I know my own people are not an innate racists group. We are a fight back group. You may get your props on here from others with your mindset, or from those who are ignorant to your white pride symbol, and that's cool. But, history is tainted by those who possess a diabolical and "racially" charged thought process. Ignorance at it's height. The lines of race are constantly blurring, and that is what can not be stopped.|`|f48d10d4bec5b5e25f9894010aed2c69aa	racism and jealousy are way different. i dont see the correlation between them..and you can never eradicate a way of thinking. it will take time but it will happen. by time i mean not in our lifetime but eventually|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	Wow....ok Ted.

Well, because it isn't a learned behavior.  If it were racism would be limited to certain parts of the world or certain cultures.  It doesn't matter where you go on this great big planet or what group of people you interact with, you will find racist people.  It's something that is part of who we are and you would have about as much a chance of eradicating racism as you would of eradicating hate or jealousy.  When people finally realize this, maybe we can drop this silly idea that multicultural or multiracial societies are good things.  Differences never bring people together and this is why multicultural and multiracial societies will always have problems.      You say, "I see racism and jealousy mostly on Y/A than even I have experienced, seems most ppl like venging all their hate on here. about black women especially, asians,obama..."  It isn't just white on minority racism.  There is just as much of it directed at whites.  Do you know why?  Because this is how people are.  They hide it in day to day life because they know if they were to speak their minds, they would be demonized.  If you think it bad now, wait until this economic crisis gets in full swing.  When times get tough, people look for someone to blame and racism is only going to grow.  Look at the numbers.  Racist groups are already growing at what some people would consider alarming rates not only in America but in other nations of the world.    In conclusion, anyone who believes that racism can be wiped out, is clearly deluded.  While people can work at suppressing their feelings, they can never get rid of them completely and because that is true, racism will never end.    EDIT - Cocoa Butter      Have you ever opened a history book and read about all the past civilizations that have enslaved other based on culture and race?  Are you completely ignorant of what is happening in Africa, the UK, France, Russia and many other places around the world today?  You would have to be to make the statements that you have made.  It's either that or you are intentionally trying to delude people into believing what you say is true, but that doesn't change the facts.  You can argue and fight against racism but in the end it isn't going to change anything, so do your best.  I will give you props for your efforts but not for your misguided cause.  Racism is part of who we are and that will not change unless humans evolve to be different on a very fundamental level.|`|Dv5HiSSraa	You mean whites and blacks?|`|sXerTGooaa	who's jealous?|`|iT0Z2icCaa	life is short we all got to live on this planet do the best we can , will it really matter in a hundred yrs from now .

WjRqYf6naa	Wiki is your friend.    Roman Catholic Church liturgical year    The Catholic Church sets aside certain days and seasons of each year to recall and celebrate various events in the life of Christ. The liturgical year begins with Advent, the time of preparation for both the celebration of Jesus' birth, and his expected second coming at the end of time. Christmastide follows, beginning on the night of 24 December (Christmas Eve), and ending with the feast of the Baptism of Jesus or later on Candlemas Day. Lent is the period of purification and penance which begins on Ash Wednesday and ends on Holy Thursday. The Holy Thursday evening Mass of the Lord's Supper marks the beginning of the Easter Triduum which includes Good Friday, Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday. These days recall Jesus' last supper with his disciples, death on the cross, burial and resurrection. The seven-week liturgical season of Easter immediately follows the Triduum climaxing at Pentecost. This recalls the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Jesus' disciples after the Ascension of Jesus. The rest of the liturgical year is commonly known as Ordinary Time.[1]    The liturgy in the Catholic Church can use one of two forms. The Ordinary Form follows the changes of the Second Vatican Council, while the Extraordinary Form retains older practices. This difference includes some changes in the liturgical calendar. Specifically, the Christmas season is longer according to the Extraordinary Form, so the following time before Lent begins is correspondingly shorter. All other seasons of the liturgical year are the same for both forms, but the placement of specific feast days varies.|`|Qn9V5rajaa	"Body & Blood of Jesus" just sounds so savage! lol    Cannibals ...they're all cannibals i tell you!!!    did i even spell that right?    oh well.    lol|`|onXPDVjqaa	You should be studying real school, why would you study a book 2000 years old that doesn't even max any sense at all?

This sentence does not contain a verb.    Nonetheless, you are talking about a ballot. On this ballot, you only get to vote for the highest offices of the country. However, there are other spots to be filled in a government, like ministers, for example. These are not on the ballot though for the citizens to vote on. Instead, they are assigned, usually either by the parliament or the president or somebody else that the people voted for.    Does that make sense?

Also I have had a dear friends deceased cat visit me and knock off a picture of me and her owner from an end table.|`|CziiDWWbaa	As real as much as you believe in them.|`|8k6kxOh2aa	yes, i've seen them in real life and i've caught some of them and other beings in pictures :)  i plan on uploading them sometime.|`|H1TZzRBkaa	No Evidence, so no... when there is scientific evidence i will believe them, but there isn't any and there is non even suggesting they are, but im guessing you want to believe in them, so you probably will like many other people.    I could explain how unluckily and why its unluckily, but i would be here forever... Just remember, just because you want to believe in it, doesn't mean it exists. :]    here you go, here is a vidio describing how and why people belive in ghosts. and stuff like that.  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=NPqerbz8KD...|`|DV7V0yJbaa	i believe they are. i believe i saw some before. i think of ghosts of people that stay on earth on not go to heaven when they die. of course some of the stuff on tv may seem fake but yeah i believe they are real.|`|pCrlYHLGaa	Most of the people don't believe in ghosts nor spirits, but I can tell I saw one once. I think they're dead people that have debts or a need to fix something in this life, and not everybody is able to see them, but the ones that have seen them don't get scared. In my case I saw my cousin's dad, and the scary part is that I didn't know how was he like, but when my dad described him, ... just like the one I saw.|`|Iw6vqJd8aa	It depends in your beliefs. If you believe in them, then they do. If you don't, they don't. So far no body has been able to prove that they are really. But then again, no body has been able to prove they aren't real. So what I guess I'm saying is what everybody is been asking.     But there is something out there. To many people have seen and heard things that can not be explained. I, myself, have seen, heard, and smelled things that were not there. But yeah, I think that they are real.|`|aQsSvS3Paa	definitely. got one in my house right now. but its real peaceful. the one in my house is just a lady that decides to walk around every once in a while. its actually kinda cool to think that someones watchin over you like that. everyone in my family has seen her, including my sister who at the age of two had conversations with it and would cry when it left..|`|BUaK8xswaa	yes i see and sense them.... but the real question is do you believe in them???|`|lc29aKxaaa	yah they are

Just see if you can find a way to help your child with what he may encounter as he grows.  You have to put your fear aside and talk to these spirits.  I am sure that the white orbes that he sees are his guardian angels that will protect him from anything bad.  Next time you see something that is frightening him just tell it to leave and set boundries for it to obey.  You may also want to do some investigating as to who it is that is visiting your child and scaring him.  But please make the most of your 6th sense and use it.|`|gmaCvh00aa	I don't think you have to keep him safe from anything, unless you really think this is some kind of evil presence.  It doesn't sound like it though.    When your child gets bigger and starts to mention or question what he sees, you might want to assure him that he just has a gift, but perhaps you should become a little more familiar with your own abilities so you can be a better guide.|`|4BQXYxPYaa	Young children routinely talk to themselves while playing, or alone. This is part of the developmental process and does not mean the child actually see's or hears anything.|`|SGjHvZsLaa	OMG You need to get out of ur house and go to someone else cuz its really bad go to ur mums or somting|`|8k6kxOh2aa	alright, first and foremost, your child is likely seeing spirits. children are more aware of spirits and paranormal beings than the rest of us. maybe your family is unique though. sometimes psychic abilites run in your family. maybe some of the orbs mean no harm, while others are attempting to scare him.    i completey sympathize with your means for this. i wouldn't worry to much unless the spirits begin to get physically violent. if this happens, i would consult a local medium or priest to offer you some help.    also, i know it isn't easy to admit stuff like this, and i hope i was able to help you at least a little.    ~stardriven09|`|tLr2mADkaa	Kelly if you and your baby can see them, play with them, it must be some hereditary psychic medium ability. That is nothing to be afraid of, just think of it as one more way to see things. Yes normally kids are more open to it than adults are.    Before someone comes and starts preaching to you that you need to get a priest and an exorcism and yabba dabba doo, There are ways to try to make it safer for your child, one is to set up an energy field around him, if you can't do that, then while you are learning how to do that, you can always ask the same spirits he plays with for help.    Or if you know that your spiritual adviser is open to this kind of phenomena, then you can consult them.  If you need more information or help feel free to contact me, and best of luck.|`|DV7V0yJbaa	maybe u should ask someone like a psychic to come out and check out ur house especially his room. that might help if you believe in that stuff. i would def. do it especially if he is happy one time with it then scared the next.|`|8c0d15366f972f0fe93e20c73c8bda50aa	I agree, they are perhaps spirits visiting your son and really shouldn't be concerned about it. I've encountered this as well with my son (also 18 months old) who, I believe speaks and sees my grandmother. You shouldn't worry yourself with them as they aren't harmful.|`|Iw6vqJd8aa	Kids see things that might not be there because they haven't been taught yet to not believe or to believe. The reasoning behind him having fun with them or being scared by them are the same things that he would has if it was "real" friends being there.     Just remember when you were a kid, were you ever frighten by the things you saw? Did you play with them?     You need to get some one to come out to check out the house. "See" what is there, then make your decision. There is no need to get all wigged out about something until you have all the facts. Just do what you have been. Watch your son, keep him safe, call and get some one to check what is there.|`|8Pro95Izaa	I read your question in it's entirety and though I normally read everyone's reply, this time I didn't. So aside from those that will talk down to you, I will assume that some people have already informed you that children see "things"  blah blah blah.     So i'm not going to touch that subject too much except for...    When children are born, they do not have a protective aura around them. Their energy is still trying to stabalize and finish comming together with their physical body. So until the age of 3 (if im not mistaken) you should always hold your child close to you. By doing this, you bring your baby into your protective auric field and keep him/her safe. Eventually they will protect themselves.     You can also cleanse your entire home and possibly drop a pinch of salt at every corner asking your spirit guides, God or angels (your choice) to protect your home and your family from any energy or entity that does not serve your highest good.     You can also keep some quartz crystals in the room but make sure your child doesn't get to them because they are a choking hazard.     In my opinion, and personal experience, this is the best thing you can do for your child. Holding him/her closer especially when you sense there might be danger.     Hope this helps,   Shadow Storm

I would advise finding a non-denominational fellowship that isn't steeped in church doctrine/tradition, but instead only teaches the truth of God's Word.    Blessings to you!    D1|`|6DQSkKgWaa	Hi MT, I grew up in a Methodist church, but my grand-father was an Assembly of God minister, and my husband grew up Orthodox.  I have lots of Baptist friends as well.  I now go to an Assembly of God church.    Let me tell you that it doesn't matter which church you go to, as long as you hear the Bible being preached, and nothing being taught that is in conflict with the bible.      How will you know this?      1.  Well, what you should do is first get the basic fundamental  truths or doctrines of each type of church you are interested in.  You should be able to do this by going online or contacting local churches and asking for a brochure explaining their basic doctrines.    2.  Once you have narrowed down the type of church, for example Baptist and Assembly of God, you will want to visit several of the local churches in your area of that denomination.  Some people like big mega-churches with all their sophisticated worship music and many programs.  Others like small country type churches with their family feel where everyone knows everyone else.  Some find comfort in the rituals of hymns and creeds, where others like they enjoy spontaneity and an informal atmosphere.  You are the only one who will know when you are comfortable in a particular group.    3.  Once you find a place you like personally, pay attention to what is being preached by the pastor and taught by the teachers.  If you hear anything questionable, you should check our what the bible has to say.  If they are teaching anything that is in conflict with the bible, you don't want to stay there.    4.  Once you establish yourself in a church that teaches the bible and you feel comfortable in, you should get to know the pastor and join some smaller groups, like Sunday School, youth group, home groups, etc.  This will help you make friends.    5. Don't get discouraged.  Even the best of churches have a few people who might say strange or mean things to you.  No pastor can control everything that comes out of the mouths of all the people who attend his church, so don't be surprised when the people are not perfect.  Just don't put any one person on a pedestal, but keep thinking what Jesus would want you to do.    I do want to say one thing to you though.   If your church is preaching that any one particular denomination is going to hell, that concerns me.  There are Christians in every protestant, Catholic, or Orthodox church as well as there are non-Christians.  Now, if they are simply pointing out particular teachings and showing you bible verses to back up what they say, that is another thing and there is nothing wrong with that, if it is done in love.    I wish I knew what area of the world you lived in.  I might be able to recommend some churches or groups to you.           For the doctrines of Assemblies of God go to this site  http://www.ag.org/top/Beliefs/Statement_...|`|RiZ6KMqmaa	Baptists are usually ok, stick with what you are comfortable with and learn about Jesus|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Catholicism is not Christian. Here's why:     The first Christians in ACTS in the Bible were NOT CATHOLIC. They were fundamentalist in doctrine. Read Acts for yourself and see.     Catholicism didn't exist for over 300 years later.     Catholicism teaches a false gospel of works ("sacraments") that leads to eternal hell (Galatians 1:6-9). Catholicism is not Christian    Jesus wants to have a personal relationship with you. Catholicism cannot give you this.     Catholicism = faith + works = no salvation and eternal torment in hell    Christian = faith alone in Jesus for salvation, without our own works added = salvation and eternity in heaven with Jesus! :)     Only faith alone in Jesus saves! Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross and rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|YyEEAJBkaa	Why don't you go there and give it a try, beats listening to these cronies anyday.|`|AA10067344	Contrary to what that first guy said, Catholics are Christian:  Here's why:  They believe Jesus is the messiah.    Now that we have that cleared up, here are the two major differences:  1.)  Catholics believe in transubstantiation.  (most) Protestants do not.  2.)  Catholics believe that salvation is attained through faith and works.  (most) Protestants believe salvation is attained through faith alone.    There are other differences but on the whole they are more similar than most from either group would care to admit.|`|7NugugsDaa	Be careful watch out for attacks from the,devil your great enemy.

Act 2:37  Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?   Act 2:38  Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.   Act 2:39  For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.

I settled on being a Lutheran (Protestant) myself, but I like the Catholic, Baptist, Southern Baptist, and Calvary Chapel churches. I prayed to decide which church to join for myself, but felt that God likes each of these as long as they are following the Bible straight. The Baptist church is fine, more informal than the Catholic church but it is good. Catholics usually think no one but them will get saved, but all the Christian churches that follow God the Father and Jesus Christ as Christian churches are able to be saved too. The Catholic church was the first Christian church so they think they have a monopoly on it. We need to be strong in the power of God and some ways to do that are: reading the bible daily or listening to it on tape, going to church, being with other Christians,  volunteering at church, praying for yourself and others and being prayed for by others. The Catholic church has  church every day, but the Protestants are not keeping up with that. We need to get to church more.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Like me you started in your 20s. I went around to various churches not really sure what I was looking for. I did not like Pentecostals because of the religious fervour and the emotional worship style. Plus it would be a frosty Friday before I would except speaking in tongues as legitimate. Too darned spooky. Baptists in Canada were fairly straight forward even boring.  I was left with the Anglicans and the Roman Catholics. I loved the aesthetic of a Cathedral, stained glass, the music sung by professional choirs, the ritual of Communion or basically the church had to be liturgical and sacramental. Plus there was an obvious reserve and reverence that suited my personality. Most of all I felt the mystery of God and life through the rituals.   Catholicism wasn't something I understood and it wasn't progressive enough for me. I get the best of both Catholicism and Protestantism. I was Baptized as an Anglican so it fit.  The other matter of importance was how scripture was interpreted. I was against the literal interpretation of the Bible which often leads to placing to high an importance on the letter of the Law.   The Bible had to be understood through context and literary form with attention paid to the historical, social and cultural circumstances of the authors and the communities for whom they were writing for.|`|AA11440601	"What separates us as believers in Christ is much less than what unites us." (Pope John XXIII)    Almost all important doctrine is completely agreed upon between Catholic Christians and other Christians.     Here is the joint declaration of justification by Catholics (1999), Lutherans (1999), and Methodists (2006):    By grace alone, in faith in Christ's saving work and not because of any merit on our part, we are accepted by God and receive the Holy Spirit, who renews our hearts while equipping us and calling us to good works.    http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontif...    There are many minor doctrine issues and some major cultural traditional differences which, I believe, do not matter that much.    A Catholic worships and follows Christ in the tradition of Catholicism which, among other things, recognizes that Christ made Peter the leader of His new Church and Pope Benedict XVI is Peter's direct successor.    For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/inde...    With love in Christ.|`|f4ik0ScQaa	Ah religion, still dividing people after thousands of years.|`|AA11723247	Catholicism still relies heavily that one's favor with God is affected by one's good deeds - or lack thereof - mixed with faith.    Catholicism believes that the disposition of the dying can somehow be changed by the living, i.e. last rites.    Catholicism believes in the nonbiblical place of Purgatory where souls can somehow be made clean before proceeding to heaven.    Although revered, Catholicism treats the books of the Apocrypha as biblical cannon, when it is not.    and on and on...    Although these Catholic doctrines are believed and practiced to different extents by different parrishes, together they represent more of a cult than a christian church.    Catholics can be saved like anyone else through faith in Christ.    Baptists, for example, believe the Bible.  Salvation is through faith alone in Christ.  Christ gained all the favor we shall ever have -- no more no less -- with the Father.  Through Christ our sins are forgiven (past, present, and future), we have a justified relationship with the Father, we have eternal life with God inheriting the kingdom of God, and we have the imputed righteousness of Christ.    Once saved through faith, we seek to obey the Lord.  We are transformed daily by the indwelling Holy Spirit into more Christ-like creatures.  We do good deeds not to bring more favor with God or to somehow secure salvation, but out of love in obedience to the Lord.  These good deeds show a faith that is alive, not dead.  But they neither save, nor bring more favor with God.|`|VzJQUCPIaa	Ignore CJ's anti-Catholic rants...he's a fundie idiot whose prejudices show every time he posts.|`|AA11188574	When I use the terms Catholic etc I am talking about the lying leaders of the church NOT those who are misled by them. Jesus mentioned that they are like sheep without a Shepard. Jesus never spoke bad to the people but the leaders was another story.

We used to have one before Christmas when I was a child (in Germany). The candles are lit one by one every Sunday until finally the fourth candle is lit o the last Sunday before Christmas. As a child this was very exciting and we couldn't wait for the last candle. A tradition which is I think not very popular in this country.|`|Gd8lhSVOaa	advent wreath
6SwaWSoyaa	I agree with the first answerer. However, quite frankly i am sick of hearing about the bailout. Our government can't make everyone happy, but instead of prejudging it why don't we actually let it happen to see where it takes us. No one knows for sure if it is mistake or not yet. If it is a big flop in the end, so what lets figure out a new way to fix it instead of bitching about it and feeling sorry for ourselves. If it turns out to be successful hooray, and lets fix some of the other problems in our world/country.|`|GkO45d7uaa	They are wasting money because that's what liberals do, which is why I'm conservative :). If anything, they should stop spending on unnecessary programs in the government to lower our debt.|`|5SJSBhshaa	Because so many with this disease are jobless and homeless because people aren't educated on the subject.|`|e0lfV7skaa	The bill is huge and complex.  You will always be able to find something about it you don't like, but the only people who claim it is waste seems to be those who, like Rush Limbaugh, want President Obama to fail.

So good luck with the present ;)|`|4gZ8FUsoaa	Love Quotes :     I love the way you make me laugh when I don't even wanna smile.    I love the way you make me laugh when I have tears in my eyes.    4 letters, 3 words, 2 people, 1 meaning: I love you    Don't frown, even when you're sad... You never know who's falling in love with your smile.    What's Tommy with out Chuckie? What's Steve without Blue? What's Dora without Boots? It's me without you.    To the world you may be just one person, but to just one person, you may be the world.    You asked me what was more important, you or my life. I said my life and you walked away not knowing that you are my life.    I don't think you realize how easily you make me laugh    All I want for Christmas is you    He stole my heart like a theift in the night    I love you like a fat boy loves cake  Someone asked me "Why do you like him so much?" But before I could even reply,    my best friend put her hand over my mouth and said, "Don't even get her started"    Promise me I'll never be second best    It's hard to say your name and not smile    So there's this boy and he sorta...kinda...completely stole my heart    If kisses were snowflakes, I'd send you a blizzard.    You're the only one that makes me draw those stupid hearts all over my paper.    Let's flip a coin, heads you're mine, tails I'm yours    There's something about you... I swear I don't know what, but it makes me absolutely crazy    I like that whole 'single flirty thing' but sometimes I wouldn't mind that whole 'holding hands, I'm his girl thing'    Once I dropped a tear in the ocean and the day I find it is the day I stop loving you    Every time I want to die I close my eyes, picture your face and then somehow, everything is okay again.    The whole world knows by the smile on my face that I've been thinking about you    Someone please throw me a life jacket because I'm drowning in his eyes    I would fall 1,000 miles if I knew you were gonna catch me    Someone asked me "Why do you like him?" But a better question would be, why don't I?    I send you 11 real roses and 1 fake one. The day the last one dies is the day I stop loving you    They say nothing lasts forever, so will you be my nothing?    I always thought you were too good and too popular for me, funny how you thought the same thing.    I don't know where I stand with you, I don't know what I mean to you. All I know is that every time I see you All I wanna do is be with you.    I'll be your 'one more time' if you be my last chance.    Sometimes I just look at him and wonder 'what the hell did I do to deserve him?'    If your body was a drug, I'd be an addict    I don't mind if he catches me staring because that means he was staring back    So I was looking up at the sky and I matched up every reason I like you with a star. But then I ran out of stars    I started to think about the last time I was happy and then I remembered it was when I was with you.    Every girl wants a guy that she can go to in her sweats, her hair a mess, make up running down her face, eyes red from crying and the first thing he says is 'you're beautiful'    I wanna be the girl you point to and say 'that's her'    I love the way you love me but I hate the way I'm supposed to love you back    Just the thought of being with you tomorrow gives me the strength to go on today    You are the only boy that makes me look forward to Monday's    Let's commit the perfect crime: You steal my heart, I'll steal yours    There's thay saying, 'one in a million' well you're one in eternity    What do you do when the one that used to be your everything has turned into just another name and just another face?    He's the kind of guy that makes you love your name just by the way he says it    Take love, multiply it by infinity and take it to the depths of forever and you still only have a glimpse of my love for you    I want you to hold me in the dark and never let me go    Getting over a broken heart is much like crossing monkey bars, you have to let go at some point in order to move on    Love is like tug-o-war, it hurts so bad to hold on but you just can't let it go    I was finally over you but then I saw that face and looked into those eyes and fell in love all over again    He's so annoying... all the little games he plays, the random things he does, the pointless things he says, how he just has to be difficult. It drives me crazy! But secretly, I love it!    And even when he's annoying the crap outta me, I still love him    The definition of perfect: every time I'm with you    Duh I love you! Ok, I'm not perfect... I'll annoy you, tick you off, say stupid things then take them back, but put all that aside and you will never find a girl that cares more about you than me    I don't think he realizes I've never fallen so hard for anyone other than him    I can guarentee nobody has ever felt this way about you before    I haven't stopped loving you, I'm just trying to stop showing it    I love you times infinity plus one    Nobody'|`|Br4ouoXjaa	"when your in love it's hard to fall asleep bc reality is better then your dreams" Dr.Seuss...oops, a bit long, but you can edit it! good luck!|`|IemwsNM6aa	maybe you could put besides i love you you could put like your true feelings in it|`|nlQyTrLhaa	"Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it."

It could be through a letter I received. It could be from a scripture I read. It could be from a blog in which I follow. God speaks to us and many, many different ways.     How do you know it is from God? Because God is not a God of fear or confusion. God is a God of love and peace. When you truly know God is speaking directly to you, you have a peace inside of you which only comes from God. When God speaks, He speaks directly to you and to your heart.     Demons can not give peace and love. Demons can only torture you and confuse you and torment you.|`|H4tPovtBaa	yeah, but I didn't understand him 'cause he doesn't speak any engleso!|`|47sALOGfaa	Add "through your hairdryer" to the end of that question.

And I said "Nuthin."  And he said "Coo. Me neither."    And that was it.|`|d7fa9e50e5bc5567eab391157f4adab5aa	Demons are stupid. Lol. That is how I discern. The knowledge spoken by God is enlightening and corrects and connects all other ideas. This is accompanied by a dislocation of the ego and jettisoning of fear. It is like being in the eye of the hurricane while the world around you flies into disarray. There are no knowledge questions from God, although there once was a free will question. I Am does not offer anything. There is no coercion, no extortion or fraud. If I Am tells you to do something, you do it. The demon (seen this thing) is dumb and looks for knowledge related answers, and is violent, very very violent, plenty of deception and misrepresentation. Doesn't reflect light. Not worth anyone's time of day. If a demon told me to do something,  I would laugh and laugh in its face, actually there are the two flaming Swords just for that purpose, now that I think of it, the demon would probably experience the slash of the Swords.  (these are Swords behind the veil)|`|sV2GO85Xaa	nah, i'm not schizophrenic|`|f4ik0ScQaa	It's funny how most people who hear voices end up in mental institutions.|`|KT7cllsLaa	No thanks god      If it did  i have a speed dial to a shrink near by|`|Ld16o3kYaa	NO.. you can speak to him all you want but if he speaks to you then you are delusional...|`|Ne9rXERpaa	Yes, he has.

When I was a child I was a christian, and NOTHING ever happened. I had ZERO connection with god, and all of the church bs. I started questioning all my Sunday school teachings when I was 4-5. When I was 12 I converted to Wicca, and THERE I found a connection with God(dess) and I felt a part of something, and I felt one with the earth, and it was 10000X more full filling than ANYTHING christian. Since then i have given up all belief in deity.... So I dunno if that helps you. But really, if god is not talkin to you, try calling her a different name.

So we broke up as it came down to alienating his family or me. I'm not saying never date outside your religion but it is a real issue. When you date someone you can't expect them to change for you or vice versa so there are bound to be problems with different religions, which you will have to compromise on. Personally, I only date the vaguely religious or less now.|`|HWF5SnCdaa	Yes, go for it.

They have mostly gone away and calmed down; occasionaly pissing the "tolerant" people off by holding rallies to suport their beliefs. The truely tolerant ignore and shun them for being stupid. Its kind of like a whiny kid if you ignore him he'll shut up and behave. Now most of the violence is from skinheads which at first glance seems to be an off shoot but is really at odds with core beliefs. skinheads typically are neo nazi which is arian belief structure which goes directly against the kkk christian basis. natl geo or discovery did a big US history a while back and they got pretty in depth to the history off the kkk, free masons, and a couple other "groups"

He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance.

AA11015890	There's no reason  why you shouldn't be speaking about it, Chloe.  Questioning these things is normal and healthy.    Kids are naturally curious and often like to emulate what they perceive as adult behaviour.  Sex is THE most adult of all, of course, and in these liberated times it no longer holds the meaning it used to do.    Loving sex is a wonderful way of bonding with your partner.  It's "making love", rather than sex, because it is tender and special.  It brings two loving people together in a way nothing else can.      Sex, on the other hand, is an impersonal or gratuitous thing that people do out of lust.     Whether it's for love or lust, the number one priority is, of course, protection.  No-one wants some heinous STD - or worse - let alone a screaming baby that refuses to let you sleep at night for more than ten minutes!    Good on you for being mature enough to ask that question!|`|6UKd0Gedaa	loose ur 4 and then oyull know|`|Gsq05hXCaa	we need it so we can reproduce and coninue the most intelligent species on the planet.|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	its not allowed before marriage.|`|mYe6TDmzaa	I'm 14 and I'm home schooled so if I have sex with a girl it is not going to be because I want to be popular.

Duh. You should have paid more attention in biology and health class    EDIT:  If you were talking about why younger people have sex and act like it's a big deal, you should have been more specific in your question. We can't read your mind. I think it's mostly because a lot of younger kids nowadays are really stupid and they don't understand the consequences that could come out of being sexually active. They think it's cool because it's what adults do. Kids are eager to grow up and be adults, because they think freedom ultimately comes with it, but they don't get that when you're an adult, you have a lot of responsibilities and worries. Kids want to have sex just like they want to smoke, and drink, and get a job. That's what I think anyway|`|azY3Qmjdaa	You are a good girl, don't let some perverted sex fiend convince you otherwise.

But, for the rest of us:    1. Sex allows us to reproduce and, more importantly, create tax deductions.  2. It gives those of us on tight budgets something to do on Saturday nights.  3. It's the glue that holds relationships together, as well as the drive that pushes them apart.  4. Without sex, we never would have invented drive-in movie theaters.  5. If we didn't have sex, are ability to shock our parents would be severely restricted. (Sometimes tattoos and body piercings aren't nearly enough.)  6. If you're a girl, it gives you a bargaining position. If you're a guy, it gives you something to hope for.    Wait until you are old enough to know what you're doing, and then give it a few more years before you start. (Unless you're my daughter, then you have to wait for my death or age 30, whatever comes first.)|`|a7af1498bf28d2d09a7253c7e912f958aa	I know most of the people said to make babies but that is a bit obvious.. I'm guessing you mean young people. Everyone says you are too young to be thinking about it too but we clearly do.    Then the point of them having sex is not to have babies yet because who would want to get pregnant at like 14, but it still happens. Like you said, it is just to be popular and be able to say they aren't a virgin and brag about it with friends, especially if the person you did it with is fit or popular already. Then that is what you would be known for around school which might appeal to some people if nobody really noticed them before. Personally it's the last thing I would want to be known for because then there are rumours and then you'd get a reputation.    At this age nobody needs sex at all it's just to see what it is like I suppose. I agree though, good for you for feeling that way.|`|Mr3cn9jXaa	It's no big deal until you're older.

But it is also for "pleasure" it should that be something that is special between you and the one you share it with. It's good that you are a virgin, and you should stay true that until you are married and you can really devote yourself to that one person for the rest of your life.

To have some fun  3.) To find out if you really love your partner.  If your 14, you really shouldn't be talking about sex yet.|`|50c1d92064fa2b7852c7d54f841b22d9aa	We do it for pleasure and to procreate.   People do it for pleasure (for obvious reasons) until they're ready to have children. Or sometimes having kids happens before you're ready. That's why birth control exists. To help prevent unplanned pregnancies.   Or people do it to have kids. They want to expand their families.     At 14 I don't think you should worry about it. It's just sex.     If you're really concerned about it talk to your health teacher or your school guidance councilor.   I guess you're in 9th Grade family studies. So your teacher will talk about birth control and how sex is an instinctual need, but rationally you can wait until your ready.|`|g7LmPVoCaa	sweetie you are 14.  Be 14.  When you meet someone and its right trust me you'll understand.  I'm not trying to be patronising but if there are people your age having sex they don't really get it.  Good sex is about relationship and about understanding your emotions.  Being 14 is about having loads of emotions and discovering life and being confused about all sorts of things and talking for hours on the phone about everything and nothing.  You will remember being 14 with great nostalgia I promise you.  However don't be closed minded about sex.  Sex when its the right time is fun and amazing.|`|gmrH0sNBaa	Most common reasons:    1.

So many pubs shutting down.|`|w29tsXLUaa	I think it so much better not have smoke making your eyes smart and breathing it in making your throat dry and getting into your hair and clothes so you smell of smoke.    By the way have you ever noticed the brown that comes out into the water when you wash you hair when you have been in a smoke environment.    No it was a good rule that one.|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	I think it has gone over the top. It would be wiser to have designated places for smokers or perhaps for non smokers, but I do like the no smoke atmosphere of a pub but rather miss the tobacco smell at the same time.  Having seen the damage tobacco can do in my own family as a child (although it was not known how then)  I an ex-smoker  think that the habit is a dangerous and very silly one.     I still remember now with loathing the advert " For your health's sake smoke Craven A"|`|4d163081b2e7d60145dd97484dd14342aa	Its brilliant - I can now go out for a night and not come home smelling of an ash tray!!!!!|`|mxosTJv5aa	i agree, smoking's horrible and i don't think other people should have 2 suffer aswell when going 2 a pub or something.|`|AA11988604	I think it's time for smoking to be limited to your own home and the homes of friends who allow smoking.    It's not going to be much longer before it's illegal to sell tobacco.    I support a person's right to grow, process and smoke tobacco for their own use, but the moment a person provides it to others, they are knowingly endangering the life of that person as well as others who may be affected by second hand smoke.    I also support the right for insurers to charge a higher rate for smokers and to require a test and/or background check to determine if an applicant is a smoker.    Smoking is an absurd practice with serious health risks that are often not born completely by the smoker, but also by society at large, due to a smoker not having sufficient insurance to treat the likely effects of smoking.    It's time for everyone to stop smoking.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	ME!!! I have bad asthma and its great to go out for a night without having to take my puffer every 1/2 hr :D|`|IuhSyW2Raa	i think it great that the smoking ban has come in cos i used to suffer with watery eyes if the smoke was really bad inside and why should us non smokers suffer for other peoples bad habits, it should have happened a long time ago|`|Ry3SGN9Kaa	non-smokers - I smoke, na na nana na!!!|`|zCaEkVccaa	I think it's a brilliant thing, there was nothing worse than going out for a meal or a drink and a) getting your clothes burnt b) coming home stinking of smoke and c) smelling/tasting it while eating/drinking.    I think it's absolutely foul & agree with it 100% it now means that people who don't smoke don't need to be put at risk by people that do. I suppose it's encouraged people to stop as well & in the long term less respiratory problems will release pressure on health services.     The less people who need to go through the pain of losing someone through lung cancer & the less people who do not develop the disease.. the better.    I'm not being a hypocrite either, I smoked for about a year & then gave up cos it was so rank.|`|i983Dk2Maa	yes i agree 110% why would you want to eat and smoke anyways there is no reason for it what so ever it makes you smell it makes your teeth yellow it gives you lung problems and cancer and you could die from something that you think makes you look cool but it dont it makes you look dumb have respect for other people who dont smoke dont smoke in a non smokers car or home or around theme|`|hbCq5h0Oaa	yeah i smoke npassive smoking can damge other peoles life    so y do it    THATS WHY WE BANNED IT LOL|`|bqpdjkRoaa	Read what the aptly named Bell End says, does he really think that only smokers are interesting, I would imagine that he goes outside to smoke and spend 30 minutes moaning to another smoker that they have to go outside to smoke and he finds this conversation interesting, I would say to him, give up this foul smelling, dangerous, anti social and very expensive habit and stay inside, talk to people who have something other than smoking to talk about, go home smelling better than an old dog end, with the knowledge that you may live longer, be healthier with much less risk of suffering the pain from smoking related deseases and without the pain of the treatments required to try to save you, you wont give up though, you will convince yourself that it wont happen to you, until it is too late, so carry on, MUG.|`|4eUwcl9Haa	They've taken it way to far. I'm also a severe asthmatic, just in case you wanted to know.|`|H8xqQcVsaa	i think its dumb, smoke goes up, so its not hurting anyone but the smoker.
9dd2ac44728dd565acf459d4a4e730d0aa	The drama has already taken place. The man has to have someone to talk to -- either another member of the family or a sympathetic stranger. He discusses the son's athletic and academic prowess and perhaps the fact that he was given a motorbike as a present for getting into university or in order to get to and from university while living at home. He blames himself for this. He agonises about the accident. He is probably aware that his son was unconscious when brought into hospital. Just use your imagination as he frets and worries about it all. The doctor's arrival to break the news is the climax and the reader must be left wondering whether the boy can ever recover well enough to resume his career.
XmD61yBpaa	Just tell the guy you will report him to his superior he won't like that especially if you tell him you will make a WRITTEN complaint.|`|DSp8azw7aa	Could try a written complaint, maybe that's one option.
1OfLNwOPaa	Deutsch sind nicht besser als andere,und so zu sagen,  "Sie sind auf selbst nicht angewiesen,aber wir auf Sie,das mussen Sie sich merken."Und so sie machen,aber nicht als lustig als Karl Valentin.    "Perfektionismus ist ein berlegenheitsmerkmal des Rassen Meisters"  Are you trying to Aryanize me?  My uncle used to joke them -dangerously- even during the Hitler days while he was a student in Heidelberg|`|Cmo1dXuOaa	This is a tough one. Your obvious hurt seems to further encourage your colleagues to make jokes at your expense. I cannot give you any legal advice but there should be recourse to bullying (mobbing) which the hospital's leadership is required to address if brought to their attention. My personal experience shows that mobbing is seldom a curable disease and will continue long after the original rationale is forgotten. You could try appealing to their better nature by explaining how their behaviour affects you. Try the following first:   Gut, ihr habt euren Spass,  was ihr m?glichgerweise nicht wisst ist wie sehr Eure Kommentare mich verletzen. Ich will ein guter Kollege sein aber dies kann ich nur wenn ihr mich auch lasst.  Wenn die Situation umgekehrt w?re und ihr in meinem Land versuchen wrdet Fuss zufassen wrde ich euch jegliche Hilfestellung geben damit ihr erfolgreich sein k?nntet. Bitte gebt mir die gleiche Chance.    Then add that you have take the step to go to night school or the Goethe Institute to better your german and that you would be grateful for any day to day assistance they might give in correcting your german. Finally find it in yourself to laugh along if you really goof up. Some things actually CAN be funny.
5Q8vMxuqaa	I'm sorry but that's just the way it is, you decided to wear it and it's against Islam to take it off once you've started. You really shouldn't have done it just because your friends did though, doesn't make sense. They have their own beliefs and you have yours, if they pressured you into wearing it then I wouldn't consider them friends..they didn't accept you for who you are. If you really really want to take it off, go ahead..it's not like its glued to your head, right? :P. It might upset your mom but still..shes your MOM she will forgive you, after all it's just a piece of cloth..even though it symbolizes something very important to her she WILL be upset. It will all blow over though, I promise..She won't hold it against you for the rest of your life. If it's bugging you that much then take it off, woman! Don't let a piece of cloth control your life..soon you'll have forgotten about the whole thing! It's your decision..you deserve support for it. good luck :)|`|QsCPOHAraa	This is a perfect example of what religion can do to people.    If you don't believe in the hijab, and you don't want to wear it, then the best thing you can do is to stay true to YOURSELF. Don't do it for anybody else. Do what YOU want to do, and what YOU feel is right for you. Take it off, and do so with pride!     Your mother has unfortunately been oppressed from childhood by her religion. You don't have to let that become your fate as well. You will have plenty of support if you take off the hijab. While you might make your mother angry, nothing is more important than pleasing yourself and following your own feelings.    Liberate yourself! Take it off and be proud! No religion has the right to tell you what you have to wear!|`|gmaCvh00aa	I understand, I was trapped in Christianity once but I escaped and you can, too.    Continue to speak to God in the way that you know.  Ask him to help you resolve this.  Parents often live through their children and want others to see how devout their kids are or they think it's a shame upon them.  You don't say how old you are, but if you are an adult, you may just have to assert yourself and refuse to wear the hijab.  If it doesn't bring you closer to God but further away, it isn't any good.|`|71afbaedac2a285cf2c6b5606a092e32aa	Assalamu Alaikum sister,    Hijab should never be worn to please anyone except Allah.  If it's your parents who are teaching Islam to you correctly.  Then you must obey, but think of the liberation that hijab gives you.  You no longer have to worry about how you look to others, saves on make-up and hair $$.      When you leave then you may choose to wear it or not.  Trust me, it's a blessing that I, personally, welcome.  I got tired of looking like others thought I should... it was driving me bonkers.  "You need more eyeshadow", "You don't have enough on.", "If only you wore more lipstick, you'd look so beautiful.", "Why do you cut your hair like that.", "Your haircut is so cool."    I watched a crowd of women, who got into my bag (we worked in a hospital) and pulled the magazine out and began verbally tearing down a model in there.  The model was perfectly proportioned the way that photograpers want them, but one woman said, "Oh my her shoulders!  She looks like a man!"  The rest had other stupid comments and I lashed them, "My hair is short, my shoulders are built up by weightlifting, doing I look like a freak to you too?"  I'm sure you can imagine the mumbling as they tried to retract their commentary with stupid excuses, but these people are everywhere.  You ready to play the game?    Insha Allah (SWT) you don't and will choose the peace of hijab.|`|X548yCR6aa	Your mom is a sick, sick person.    Do the right thing and get rid of this piece of cloth. Burn it or something, make it symbolical. Don't let your mother run your life, it's all about control, break free.|`|0c0ba9b958b88b34939b5aab7b0ff11caa	u should follow ur mom decision..  i'm a muslim|`|f4ik0ScQaa	You are being oppressed, stand up for yourself.  If you're parents or peers won't help you, find a help group who will.  Depending on how old you are you may even want to call the police, they will have details of suitable groups.|`|cLGVSuFqaa	wow  my advice would be if all this anger and upset is coming from one piece of material on your head that you should it off  you should wear it because you want to   no-one else should influence you  and you should wear it for the right reasons  i wear it because i know i should  i understand how you are feeling  but next time do not ask your mum, just tell her  she cannot do anything about it and im sure she hates that your upset|`|wahkn5sLaa	I'm not exceptionally religious or anything but what I've learned is that if you want to wear a hijab, you should only do it out of pure love of Islam and God ; not because you have to. Try and explain this to your mom, or talk to a religious figure about how you feel, they might be able to give you good advice or be able to talk to your mom for you.|`|m8kF5U84aa	well I don't know what a hijab is or i would tell you. and I don't know what your religion is so I don't know what to tell you!! I am so sorry for you.|`|oEe2Rdifaa	ok now do you wear burkha (gown)? hijab in islam is only to cover your chest and hairs and wear a lose fitting clothes. you are not wrong. allah is very merciful. alllah don't want to hurt his creatures.    do you wear full hijab like covering your eyes, hands and all?    mail me details. don't be afraid i won't hurt you. i am here to help.|`|GDexucXKaa	My daughter (14)  is having similar thoughts - Her Dad is very religious and insists that she wear a hijab.   She and I agree that it should be her choice (and she thinks that she WOULD choose to wear it, but hates being "forced" by her Dad), but we can't go against what her Dad says.  So, I advise her to just play along until she's 18 and then do what she wants.      There are a LOT of Muslimahs in our area who only put on their hijabs for the mosque.      Hang in there.  Don't think about dying just because you have to wear a scarf.|`|VGdGRi3Qaa	who gives a ****. loser? get a life and stop buigging us, fool!|`|TF023Pr4aa	Dont be depressed.Be proud of who you are and not  how you look.|`|hVEGaRMbaa	Do what everyone else does when they need to get a fresh start: move to San Diego! or San Francisco... point is, this is a very accepting country and people will let you change if you need to.|`|yTAqjJ7aaa	hey, i feel it would be a better option for you if you asked this in the Ramadan Section, which is in Holidays.  Many people will be able to give you advise there.
863D1b94aa	Cry and cry until my tears are dried up!!  :(|`|03f6d70aa511193e6f0a3fd450df20e2aa	Just shrug your shoulders and move on,   sweety. There's nothing else you can do,   personally...you could have been used.     He felt one way.   Led you on.   Got what he wanted.   Left.|`|qR7lwYeraa	masterbate.|`|rGWiOVDIaa	He sounds more confused than you. No one would do that just to make them feel better if there is no attraction there at all. He sounds like a jerk.|`|2DBlazZraa	Him reaching an orgasm doesn't necessarily mean that he fully enjoyed it, it is just a reaction of the body. Maybe you should just tell him how you feel, he might think that you are in love with him and he doesn't want anything more than a friendship with benefits. Good luck I hope you figure out what you can do to have everyone be happy in this situation.|`|W545hqrpaa	He is battling with himself... trying to figure out his sexuality. Give it some time. He will come around. Especially if you have had sex with him more than once and he had an orgasm each time. He will want to feel that way again. Act nonchalant about the whole situation.|`|AA11140462	First of all, you are in love with him. That's why it stings.    He likes the sexual part, but he doesn't want to be thought of as being gay or bi-sexual. He is probably still questioning his sexuality and if he is gay, it iwll probably resurface later.    I know that you can feel rejected and used, but I wouldn't take it personally, If he told you that he was questioning his sexuality before you became involved, then you are responsible and you made the choice to have sex with him knowing that he isn't totally secure in his sexuality. He might have wanted to try it, but now decided that he is more attracted to females than males, if that is true, he might be bi-sexual with a preference for women, he can't help it. That is just how he feels. It's the same as if you tried it with a woman and she became angry that you won't just switch your sexuality because she likes you.    He might turn around and decide at a later time that he actually is more attracted to you and admit to himself his sexuality. He is probably scared of being rejected by other people and his family and he probably fears not being "normal" if he admits to himself his true intensions.    If he doesn't want you, that is his loss because right now there is probably a guy somewhere who really wants to be with you. If he mentions women, say something like "John, I had some feelings for you that you can't recipricate for me because you are straight and I was confused about whether you had feelings for me when we had sex. I know that it can't work because of your sexuality (being straight). I want you to find a girl that makes you happy, but for now I'm just getting over that so I don't really want to talk about girls right now.    I wouldn't kick him out because it isn't his fault that he is confused and has a seemingly stronger attraction to women. Many bisexual men are extrememly sex oriented because they are more cofused. Gay men a lot of times are love and relationship oriented because they have come to terms with being gay.     Go find a gay guy at a bar who is more compatible with you. Take this sex as part of learning and move on. Don't ever do anything sexually with him again, even if he askes because it will cause heart break for you. Say something like " I don't want things to be wierd for us, so we should just forget the sex between us ever happened and I'm going to move on. I still want you to be my roommate and I want to respect the fact that you are straight (even if you believe that isn't true). Let's be friends and see other people who are more compatible with each of us." Then go out and find someone new. Go dancing and see if you can score a date with someone new. That will get your mind off of this guy.    Good Luck man ...
sKw5GeeMaa	take your girl for a back-to-the-past sort of  thing. like if you took her to, say, Twilight, go watch it again(since you can't watch it in the movies, rent it). Of course you'll want the traditional valentine's day card. inside write in what you remember first saying to her when you guys met.  Memories are a vital thing(to me). I'm not sure what other girls would suggest or want, but i'm sure they'd find a memory very blush-worthy.|`|HZvo9YFHaa	a nice quiet evening with dinner, movie and a lil extras at the end.|`|ZI9yw0yXaa	Whenever I dont know what exactly to get someone, I send special digital photo (landscape, my friend portraitor something like that) to http://www.photoartomation.com and they convert my photo to ART  It's a great site to create a really personalized photoart gift for someone special in your life!
iHDYncuXaa	Here are some men and women who mocked God:    JOHN LENNON: Some years before, during his interview with an American  Magazine, he said: "Christianity will end, it will disappear. I do not  have to argue about that. I am certain. Jesus was ok, but his subjects  were too simple, today we are more famous than Him" (1966). Lennon,  after saying that the Beatles were more famous than Jesus Christ, was shot  six times.    TANCREDO NEVES (President of Brazil): During the Presidential campaign, he said if he got 500,000 votes from his party, not even God would remove him from Presidency. Sure he got the votes, but he got sick a day before being made President, then he died.    CAZUZA (Bi-sexual Brazilian composer, singer and poet): During a show in Canec? ( Rio de Janeiro ), whilst smoking his cigarette, he puffed out some smoke into the air and said: "God, that's for you." He died at the age of 32 of AIDS in a horrible manner.    THE MAN WHO BUILT THE TITANIC: After the construction of the Titanic, a reporter asked him how safe the Titanic would be. With an ironic tone he  said: "Not even God can sink it" The result: I think you all know what happened to the Titanic.    MARILYN MONROE: She was visited by Billy Graham during a presentation of a show. He said the Spirit of God had sent him to preach to her. After hearing what the Preacher had to say, she said: "I don't need your Jesus". A week later, she was found dead in her apartment.    BON SCOTT: The ex-vocalist of the AC/DC. On one of his 1979 songs he sang: "Don't stop me, I'm going down all the way, down the highway to hell". On the 19th of February 1980, Bon Scott was found dead, he had been choked by his own vomit.    CAMPINAS/SP IN 2005: In Campinas, Brazil a group of friends, drunk, went to pick up a friend. The mother accompanied her to the car and was so worried about the drunkenness of her friends and she said to the daughter holding her hand, who was already seated in the car: "MY DAUGHTER, GO WITH GOD AND MAY HE PROTECT YOU." She responded: "ONLY IF HE (GOD) TRAVELS IN THE TRUNK, CAUSE INSIDE HERE IT'S ALREADY FULL". Hours later, news came by that they had been involved in a fatal accident, everyone had died, the car could not be recognized what type of car it had been, but surprisingly, the trunk was intact. The police said there was no way the trunk could have remained intact. To their surprise, inside the trunk was a crate of eggs, none were broken.    Christine Hewitt: A Jamaican Journalist and entertainer, said the Bible (Word of God) was the worst book ever written, in June 2006 she was found burnt beyond recognition in her motor vehicle.|`|jW0VqZcOaa	Blaspheme, smashpheme...    God is a wanker!    That goes double for the holy spirit!    Rene O bends over for Jesus!!!

Of course you can list people who blasphemed and died.  You can also list pious people who prayed and died.    Pointless exercise.|`|g7ouXuoQaa	wow, what a forgiving god he is!!! XD|`|kXhAERt3aa	No - it is not even on Snopes.com.  So it must have been very marginal.    It is pretty funny that in all those samples from Rene O, God seems to wait for years after the incident to kill people, almost as if there was no connection at all.  Let's see - John Lennon makes his remark in 1966, but dies in 1980, so apparently saving you are more popular than God does not really upset him at all , from the sound of it.|`|RI7k02enaa	I just got that email a little while ago. I googled it and got results showing different versions of it but they were the same email for the most part. I typed the city and the country that the accident with the eggs happened in then I typed fatal accident. I'm not sure what the city was but you could probably just type in the country; Brazil. I'm not sure about the reliability of all of these stories but through my research, I didn't find anything that pointed that it was ether true or false. I even looked for the original news article and I couldn't find it. I also didn't see anything valid saying that it didn't really happen, only assumptions. My current conclusion is that all of the stories in the email, more specifically, the one about the fatal accident and the eggs, might actually be true but I'm not sure. I hope this helps.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I remember the health nut Rodale on the Cavett show.    He said he was going to die in a long time, hit by a cab at a great old age.

Until you address what made you freak and leave you can't correct it. You have to correct yourself an continue to try and win her back in the process. If she see's your not going to give up on her and you want to mend the hurt you've caused her she might be willing to give you another go.

u9yU7scTaa	I'm in 12th grade and I live in Eastern Europe.    What did you read as a child?  Fairy tales in Romanian.   When I was a bit older, 11-ish, I used to really like Mark Twain (still do) and Pinocchio.   Then came Harry Potter and I started obsessing about that one. After reading it in my second language I looked for the original version. I obtained the basic English which I needed to actually start reading from cartoons and movies subtitled in Romanian.  After that I read a lot of HP-related fanfiction.    What do you read today?  Um... it varies... I mostly read random info about stuff I'm interested in (that's not very helpful, is it?).   ...For example, I want to learn Hungarian, so I read Kato Lomb's book, "How I learned languages". I wanted to install Linux on my computer, so I read a book about Linux. I'm considering studying chemistry after finishing school, so I'm reading anything chemistry-related that I can get my hands on.  ...Realistic novels.  ...Romanian literature which they make me read in school.    What do you enjoy reading? Why?  All of the above, except for the Romanian literature (because they made me read it; might have been enjoyable otherwise). I like useful books and texts. I dislike detective and romance novels.    What is difficult for you to read?  Shakespeare in the original :) Esoteric, philosophic novels; books that have complicated concepts.

LDL5rlapaa	Here is a couple websites you can take alook at, they are plenty of opportunities for people in the medical field to volunteer, some of the local churchs in your area will probably go on one this summer, talk to a local Pastor and you can probably go with them, good luck and God Bless!!
9b0be80867d1ad95670fa1fcd5252fd3aa	The only options you have at this point are:    Checking to see if there is a city-wide chapter that includes your school.    Transferring to another school that has an active chapter (I would NOT recommend this option as you are in school to earn a degree not to join an organization)    Wait until after you graduate and join an alumnae chapter.    Good luck to you!|`|k8jrTH3Xaa	start your own soroity|`|0HYfFZKVaa	You could check their website to see if there are any city chapters that cater to your college. Also you contact National and try initiating a new chapter or what it called charter. Hope this helps. GOOD LUCK!!!

O1QBA5XSaa	They tell me I'm not Christian all the time. And its when I defend non-Christians and homosexuals.    Go figure...|`|YQOT68xFaa	The thing is....there are some passages in the Bible dealing with this very thing. God Himself has told us that if a person who claims to be a Christian shows absolutely no evidence in their life, there is a good chance that they never were saved to begin with. For example: someone who continues on and on in some kind of serious sin. Adultery, for example. Say you've got a man who claims to be a Christian, but he has a mistress on the side that he cheats on his wife with. He doesn't stop after he claims to have been converted. He doesn't see any need to stop doing it and he doesn't care how wrong it is. According to Scripture, someone with that kind of an attitude towards sin is more than likely not saved at all.    I agree, the No True Scotsman thing can be overdone. I'm sure I've been guilty of it myself! But the Bible does speak about this issue. There is a basis in our faith for using this argument. And hey, don't forget that Jesus Himself said "not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall inherit the kingdom of heaven." There are alot of people on this earth who claim to be Christians, but they have never really put their trust in Jesus and been saved. They are relying on their works. Or they go to church and own a Bible because it's how they were raised (or to keep up appearances...lotta people do that!). But that isn't enough. The Biblical definition of a Christian is someone who has turned from their sin and believed in Jesus for their salvation. It isn't about going to church or calling yourself a Christian. It's about the heart.|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	Whatever you believe in, I can guarantee you that there are people who fall in the same category who are an embarrassment to that belief.      Do you like being identified with the people in R & S who are spiteful and hateful and vicious and answer questions that are not addressed to them and ask questions just to harass people?    Who answer every question with "God doesn't exist" or some variation of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.      I don't think anyone is saying Christians don't make huge mistakes and aren't guilty of many things, but when somebody comes on here and says that Hitler was a Christian and tries to identify all Christians with the Westboro Baptist church, can you blame us?|`|DRSv6SOLaa	Some 'claim' the name 'christian' but don't even know the first thing about it!|`|WSlxwSlFaa	I went to church for a few years (forced by parents) and I belived in god, But then a good friend of mine how is a recently converted christian said that "you might belive in god but that doesnt make you a real christian"  I was out raged. Now Im Agostic,       Its crazy, Theres a church in my community that think that thier church and 2 others are the only 'real' chirstians, and everyone else is going to hell,       If you belive in god, just be agostic like me, I belive a god but I HAVE A MUCH BORDER SENSE OF HIM.|`|AA11622701	Be definition, a Christian is not just someone who belives in Christ, but also attempts to live according to his teachings and principles.  If a person is not doing that, they do not mean the definition of a Christian.  It is unlike the Scottsman analogue, where you either are or are not regardless of your actions.  That should be a simple enough concept.|`|DidciweAaa	I spend my precious little time on entertainment rather than giving it to Jesus.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	But the Bible itself says that there are people who claim to be believers, but are not.     So I reject your "no true Scotsman" fallacy, as a fallacy in itself.|`|4sUek7ugaa	If all the people who had ever been called Not A Real Christian were removed from the statistics, Christianity would probably be the world's smallest religion.|`|rThIVk2maa	Hey first answerer guy: atheism isn't a religion.     I dunno, people use a lot of logical fallacies. Atheists are not exempt.|`|Ex4Lv68yaa	Not true.  I personally know several folks who believe in Jesus who are NOT christian, nor do they have any desire to label themselves as such.  Jesus never subscribed to religion, nor did he start it.  His followers started it.  "Man made religion, not God."    Religion isn't a necessary component before believing in God. That is a lie.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	I agree. Rene and CJ tell us Catholics are not Christians all the time, and they tell lies about us while doing so and proclaiming themselves Christians...      Rene O, heed your own words!!!!!!!!!    "If it doesn't walk like a Christian or talk like a Christian, chances are it is NOT a Christian.    Matthew 7:20 (New International Version)  20Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them."|`|bT3mzootaa	It's true wee, we are no one to judge each other.That's not what GOD called us for.If any body in CHRIST sins the WORD OF GOD says that we have an advocate who understands our problems HE himself having lived in the flesh and knowing how hard it is to fight against our human nature.So yes ,christians aren't perfect,and sometimes you might encounter one who might fail an expectation, but only GOD can judge them,but they must still carry on in GODS GRACE.GOD BLESS!!|`|gTjtaG0Faa	Lets think about this another way,    you want to know why One bad Christian should be allowed to spout ignorance and stupidity and holding all other Christians to HAVE to back what they say regardless so on that principal then ALL Muslims are terrorists, ALL french people cheat on their spouses and ALL Catholic's refuse to use birth control.     There are millions of Christians and hundreds of different beliefs and ways of thinking Lutherans, Baptists, Catholics, Assemblies of God, the list goes on and on because they don't ALL think the same.    If you are a college student at Harvard do you then think the same way as ALL the other students??     NO, each person follows truth and conviction in their own way whether its to be Agnostic, Atheistic or someone who believes in a Divine God.    Each person is accountable for themselves and themselves alone.|`|quE4OkRyaa	I've seen it done by atheists as well.    When I mention Anne Rice and her leaving atheism for Christ, the atheists here say she once was Catholic so she wasnt a true atheist!!!!!!    Irrational thinking is done by all religions, including the atheist religion.|`|rbdZQOGzaa	If you haven't noticed (which i'm sure you have) they have a circular logic. You never will a logical answer, its almost pointless, like trying to nail jelly to a tree.|`|iHDYncuXaa	If it doesn't walk like a Christian or talk like a Christian, chances are it is NOT a Christian.    Matthew 7:20 (New International Version)  20Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.|`|vjmXiIfnaa	Going to church doesn't make you any more a Christian than standing in your garage makes you a car.    Putting in this context really bothers me, but if you say you are part of something then you need to abide by the rules and expectations of that something. I could say that I'm a rhinoceros, but then you would want me to show/prove it, right?|`|xuVrGHHlaa	I agree it is a ridiculous claim to make as we can never truly know the spiritual state of another.    However it is just as ridiculous as the fallacy of Guilt by Association.  Just because a particular person, even if a Christian, behaves in a specific manner does not indicate that that behavior is either Christian or approved by Christianity.|`|9CLmGBSLaa	I am a Christian and I agree with that statement. That is ridiculous to say they are not "true" Christians. In reality, they are weak Christians. We all are actually. But some are swayed more to worldly things then others. We never claim to be perfect, but one bad apple spoils the barrel and they are the ones who need prayer and fellowship.|`|8lMrfgDxaa	Please don't spread that nonsense on me and say that you are Christian just because you believe in Christ. Do you also believe in Joseph Smith and Thomas S. Monson too? Yet you have the nerve of calling yourself "Christian". You don't deserve the title and Mormons can say I'm not Christian all they want and say I believe in Harold Camping. It makes no difference to me if the Mormons persecute the truth for their un-Christian man-made dogmas. But let God judge you righteousely for your Mormon ways. I pass no judgment on Mormons like you who want to earn the title of Christian. I'm telling you the truth though that because you are Mormon, you don't know anything about being a True Christian and are only following sinners like Joseph Smith and Thomas S. Monson. The Bible says everyone sins, yet the Mormons think they are perfect and can become gods. That is impossible.|`|t88527U1aa	Jesus himself said their would be many claiming they knew him but they don't! I always hear on this site quotes about the   of Christians incarcerated is so much higher,why do you think that is? Do you think they claim Christianity because they think it will help them in prison and parole board? We need to think before we state things like this many people claim to be Atheist here and really don't knows what it means does that make them Atheist!|`|eoOmeeJoaa	What they really mean is that they are not following the teachings of whichever one of the Christian faiths that they belong to.  They mean that they are not being a good Christian or practising their faith according to their own ideas and not the church's tenets.  I really had no problem figuring this out, why do you?  Could it be a hostility towards Christians?|`|AA12048147	It does seem to be over done in some cases, but still the claim is a real one..... It is just the nature of *religion*... There is a saying I refer to at times : 80 % have it 100 % wrong, 19 % 50% right, and 1% have it 90% right, there is no 100 % but Jesus !!! If you look at the murders in God's name.... the judgments made.... the bashing.... etc.... I think you will get the same conclusion..... just a side effect of *religion*..... and of course being HUMAN !!!! go in peace.... God bless|`|75ZxAANkaa	you are right to a point. i think that every man makes mistakes. even christians make mistakes and big ones too. salvation doesn't make us perfect, it just means that we have excepted his free gift of salvation which makes us white as snow. it doesn't mean that they aren't saved it just means that they have something that they need to work out with God.    think of salvation as this. we are like a piece of metal and God is our blacksmith. As the blacksmith refines the metal it becomes like a mirror that he can see himself in it.When we become christians we become refined. our sins don't go away they just get covered up with God's forgiveness and love and he can see himself through the mirror instead of our sinful selves.|`|5oltZU5saa	It's a form of denial. I have been a Christian a long time and know that we are all human and capable of many atrocities. This is why being a sinner saved by grace is of great value to a believer because our real hope of salvation is in Christ who can save the worst of sinners. A God of love governors our values and it is the goal to achieve a Christ likeness, however, we will never fully arrive in this life. Granted a relationship with God is a great satisfaction in this life but we are damaged people who can, in turn, do damage.|`|FOZGMadaaa	Satan knows there is a God but did that make him a Christian.Yet he still opposes God.|`|AA11528489	Although I avoid saying that Christians who commit atrocities aren't true Christians, there are two points I'd like to make:    1) The New Testament says that true Christians are shown by the fruit of their actions. If a Christian produces destructive fruit, it implies they aren't a Christian. In the true sense, a Christian isn't just someone who follows the creeds of a particular denomination, whether wholeheartedly or simply perfunctorily, but someone who has attained salvation through the atonement of Jesus Christ and works of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, in this sense, it is clear that someone who calls themselves a Christian, may not be. Simply because someone or something calls themselves something, if they fail to meet the required definition, they are not. North Korea is officially the "Democratic People's Republic of Korea". Most of us will agree North Korea is not Democratic (and barely a republic).  2) Almost all atrocities labelled at Christians' feet are complicated events with a multiplicity of social, political and economic factors.  3) Atheists use this fallacy at the same time. Again, I dislike using an "atheists did this so atheism must be wrong" (argumentum ad hominem), but it is important to point out that actions carried out by atheist governments, with the aim of establishing an atheist state, have, at times, been entirely deplorable. Again, the causality of these events, such as Stalin's persecution of the Orthodox Church, is often more complicated than "atheism did it".|`|M6vUJ5bBaa	A very good point, little one: Many people are quick to run and judge someone else, but that should not happen. You see, Christians are far from being perfect. In the book of 1John 2:1-2 "My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not ours only, but also for [the sins of] the whole world". So you see, it doesn't really matter what anyone thinks that makes a difference, it is what is in your heart. Thank you for your question/statement...
MWwOQmzIaa	My letter to my university basically said how I was interested because of the available opportunities not just for my career but for strengthening the university and surrounding community by student involvement. I emphasized academics and community service as a unit that I took pride in and talked about how I felt like WSSU would be the excellent source to reach my fullest potential in reaching those dreams. Sure it was a bunch of crap, but it worked!|`|mUK240ykaa	See :     http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...    http://www.collegeview.com/articles/CV/a...    http://www.collegeboard.com/student/appl...

She doesn't know your economic situations. And she's disrespecting your parents as well. It's not that big of a deal, she needs to calm down.|`|xnsU60hhaa	Yes, she was extremely rude. She should have told you the cost as soon as she made the appointment. And she made absolutely no effort to find out after you asked her. It would have been as simple as picking up the phone and calling the salon. They don't just name a price when you walk in the door.|`|07YBD5mJaa	ya, sounds like you could use a new friend. she's sounds like a snotty brat.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	Yep it's rude. She's a spoiled little brat that needs to be sent off to finishing school.|`|Rr1bh2P1aa	yes that's pretty rude|`|AhIUqmiRaa	Yeah I think that was prettu rude and disrespecful|`|Dhsyroekaa	RUDE. RUDE. RUDE.  its a freakin hair cut, more important things to argue over than a hair cut!!! she needs to get over herself, who cares if she made one simple phone call saying this time and this date. She needs to grow up and stop bashing others' families.|`|jWMXi3Lnaa	I could understand getting mad at having to cancel, but saying that about your parents is ridiculous!|`|mOayTJDmaa	Yes, no one should call your parents cheap.    Besides, I wouldn't give my daughter money if I thought the cost was too much.|`|HI0oQriqaa	she should apologize . that was very rude and insulting to you and your family.|`|Xxt4pEyEaa	I think she should change to thong undies to briefs. Obviously it's it's causing that stick in her butt to be permanently lodged.|`|1hciyvKdaa	When we make plans with friends, such as these plans you certainly could of called way in advance and asked price ranges and been able to of changed salons without much ado. Yes she was rude, yes she was assuming of what your parents considered a fare price for your hair cut. Some people really get embarrassed when they have to call and cancel things, she is probably like that. Some people are keen on getting all the details together when they make plans and some are not. This type of friend, has shown who and what she really is, Im sorry she is not someone that you really can call a friend, she dialed a phone number, she was not put out to make this appointment, and then made a second call to cancel. She thinks she is way too special.|`|GoWPQvgHaa	That is rude!|`|PmNGnHU8aa	kinda.|`|l69tjl0paa	Thats really rude! It's none of her buisness how you and your family decide to spend you money!|`|SNEj54ZPaa	Yes that is totally rude! Tell her since she wants you to go that she should pay for it. No matter how much someone makes, most are careful how they spend their money.|`|wcDy86xuaa	Tell her your families finances are not any of her business, and you find it rude she can make assumptions on your family's priorities of where their money goes...|`|5haXKcIuaa	i agree very much.. its none of her buisness to say how ur parents should spend their money... and if u can get a haircut cheaper and still look good then theres no point.. she should of told u all about it before she made the appointment. its not ur fault at all!|`|3Dhacs6caa	its not the rudest thing to say, but its definatley not the nicest. and if i was ur friend i would've been upset too. but things happen, its just one of those small arguements that every friendship needs.|`|yenUJGsoaa	I agree with you,its pretty rude of her because its not your fault that your parents cant pay for it,why don't you guys go in half with it or something make it fair|`|XUSq0gHoaa	No doubt it is very rude, but I want to know what you responded? and I don't think she is the kind of person you should be hanging out with.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	Yes, that was very rude of your 'friend' to say those things.|`|zLe2HNI2aa	uh, not realllly,   cause its not your faultt,.  shes the one being rude.  tell her to grow up. :)  im on your sideee budd ")|`|105d8bb6a943a812def853bcae69c438aa	In fact that is very rude.  It doesn't matter what your parents do maybe your money isnt all just for fun and games.   You should let her no that that was rude and that you don't appriciate it.|`|DSp8azw7aa	I guess you won't be on speaking terms for awhile.|`|IGhUA1Vdaa	Yeah this was rude and it's non of her business what your parents do for a living and how much money they make.    Your parents are being responsible and not blowing their money so your family can have the things you need.    Even people with good paying jobs scrimp and save and go cheap sometimes.|`|HCkr0c0Qaa	That's so rude. To say that, well i wouldn't put up with it if anyone said that to me. Make her apoligise. To say your parents are cheap and your dad should be able to pay for it just because your dad is a laywer, maybe he doesn't want too or maybe he hasn't got the money she's out of order.    It is dear to pay for your haircut these days but to say that SHE'S OUT OF ORDER.|`|R5UIMBvcaa	I think you're entirely right and you handled the situation very well.  Your friend, not you, is the one who was rude.|`|bglr4m0Naa	She shouldn't be judging you based on how much your parents are willing to spend on something. I don't think she is a real friend.|`|f1a7c9b6b59a85d3cbcccab541ef30d8aa	not rude, its funny.|`|g5Ywoh2Qaa	i agree that was pretty rude to say|`|Dfppbeo8aa	yes, I would agree.|`|f7l9byFGaa	yes it's rude of her to think just because your dad is a lawyer that he can afford it.|`|AA11015885	I agree, she is very rude.|`|NNWerE4Jaa	Yes i agree...|`|NW39CoLKaa	Wow. that was really b*tchy. I agree, it was rude.|`|QC6pR4y6aa	its rude yeah. but why cant you figure it out yourself i mean its not like she would be able to figure out exactly how much it is.  its was rude, about your parents though.|`|SsCMH480aa	well tell her that if its "cheap" to her then she shud be able to easily afford to pay for UR haircut...... she shud realize that what works in ome family does not always work in another...... n yes i wud have been offended if it were me|`|UtwtOcRNaa	that is rude. yeah. maybe she's annoyed yeah, but she shoudln't bring your parents or their decisions into this, its absolutely none of her business. And its her fault she didnt give you the right price before she made the appointments. i think she's the one being cheap.|`|YYgeAb1Naa	She'zz A Roodey!!|`|o5ANsyK6aa	yeah, that was pretty rude, but you should have figured out everything for yourself and you wouldn't be in this situation|`|4JIku478aa	Does she need you to hold her hand while she gets a haircut or something? It's not the end of the world because she can't get a haircut with you. If she was really your friend she'd understand. Perhaps you could go with her just not get your hair cut yourself, or you could both find a cheaper place and be able to go together. It sounds very rude of her, and it's not your fault your parents won't pay for it. Just because yoru dad CAN afford it, doesn't mean he WILL.|`|lR8CuaDfaa	wow.. ... yea that's rude.  I'm guessing she's a spoiled brat and her parents pay for anything she asks for?|`|Fr6GdIQ3aa	On a scale of 0-to-Rude, I give it an 8.5.|`|E05XfFbnaa	That is extremely rude and i think you should tell her that|`|SyAIl2btaa	Thats not right, yea i completely agree with you on that on.|`|bAbb37Adaa	That was very rude, you are right. It's not a matter of how much money your father makes, if you're not comfortable with the cost then your 'friend' should respect that.|`|XYDymAtYaa	Well, she was just telling you how she felt...her appointment is canceled because of it - even though she didn't have ALL the info..I think you don't know what rude is yet sunshine ;-D|`|lTOeMNnraa	yes, that's a horrible  thing to say.but hey she could of said worse|`|65195589e245f2da9d89cac376b35462aa	It is a rude thing to say and just because you had to cancel your appointment, I don't see what that has to do with her. Why does she have to cancel her appointment?? Even if your dad is an attorney, so what!! If the cost of the hair cut is too much, as a parent I wouldn't pay for it either!! Some place charge a ridiculous amount. Your mom was right to say no and your "friend" is rude!!|`|KwkEvmpPaa	Oh My God Yes I agree that was very rude of her to tell you that first of all she didn't eve an tell you how much it was going to be until a day before and just because your dad is a lawyer doesn't mean he's gonna be spending money like crazy especially with the economy right now we need to save as much money as possible|`|hRV18njLaa	If someone had said that to me, i'd of wanted to slap them.    How horrible. =(    Dont worry about her she is obviously jealous or not a very good friend.   You can always get your hair cut without her in a different place and i bet hers will looks crap.    =)|`|tUsVkMPwaa	rude, stupid, dumb and unnecessary|`|vk6sczbLaa	I agree. I mean, there's nothing you can do about it if your parents won't pay unless you scrounge up the money on your own. It was especially rude of her to assume that your family would think nothing of spending so much on a haircut just because of the job your dad has. Calling you guys cheap for that was just ridiculous.    I think this situation would not have occurred if you both took the time to get the prices before scheduling the appointments, but she really didn't have to respond like that.|`|24cfb9540386b800bb43a544c412b806aa	She was rude. If she did "everything", she could have told you a long time ago how much the haircut cost before making an appointment for both of you. Besides, it doesn't matter what your parents do or or how much money they have. Smart people still know the value of things and will decline to pay for overpriced things. That's how they keep their money, and don't end up broke or in debt with nothing to show for it. It's their money; they get to decide how to spend it and she has no right to judge.  I would cut off a friend who felt they could insult my parents like that.|`|cDjWONryaa	Well, if she is a regular customer at this hair salon and you are canceling the appointment at the last minute then you have to understand that hair dressers work on a clientel basis and appoinments are important as they are  booked in advance and therefore you took up space that the stylist could have made money by filling.  So I can understand your friends embarassment. However, you friends could have and should have told you sooner as to what the cost was or you very well could have taken the responsiblity and call the salon yourself if you were that concerned with the costs.  So ultimately I would say you had an obligation to be mature and grown up about and I can understand both of your points.|`|GdBjTovfaa	it was mean , i guess you could have said i am sorry you feel that way let me call for myself, and i told my parents what you think of them ..|`|3jGGzCUJaa	Well your both right in my opinion it was rude for her to talk about your parents & especially throw out that your dad is a lawyer & therefore must make alot. THat should be beside the point. Your parents right or wrong are your parents & you & she should respect them as such. Having said that it was sort of rude by your parents to make you cancale last minute something you & your friend had been working on for a while & isnt something like you were going to do alot or often. If your mom wanted to be fair she could have said well thats alot for a haircut but if you want to do it then you can do some extra chores or something to pay up for the difference. Then she could give you say 20 bucks for a regular hair cut & tip & then you could do chores for the rest & in the end get the needed amount. Still you did what was right by listening to your parents & your friend was very rude but there were ways to overcome the situation even last minute that didnt have to mean cancaleing it especially since she reserved the appointment & set it all up it was a special occasion & again there were ways to work around it. Your parents mom at least wants to teach you that money isnt everything or doesnt grow on trees & that just because you have it doesnt mean you need to spend it especially in this ecomony. Maybe you could go back to your mom & ask about doing chores to make up the difference then you can keep the appointment & still show your mom you learned her point.|`|doha66YWaa	If my friend said that to me I'd tell her not to speak to me like that etc etc then hang up and not talk to her for a while|`|1ThWEediaa	No it's just stupid because the hair cuts are always expensive and it's nothing that can make you guys get mad at each other.....................  I think that going to get a hair cut with your friend is a nice idea and when it's expensive it's better because that tells you how good they are going to the work and how nice your hair it's gonna look TAKE CARE BYE AND I HOPE YOU GUYS GOT BETTER.....................................|`|8aL1bsi3aa	I completely agree.  I don't think that was her place to say anything.  I'm sorry that happened to you.  =(  It sounds like a situation in my life, lol!|`|2YJDIGZpaa	wow ur friend is a *****.|`|ADwKztGsaa	i agree, thats pretty rude. she shouldnt be talking about ur family because its none of her business.|`|fDYxwfYwaa	That is rude. Not a good friend at all.|`|Yc6wSOuSaa	You shouldnt blame him he still wanted to go with you it was his parents who stopped him.|`|VJtJxgTaaa	Yes its rude.|`|pS9PNOSiaa	Well, I think both sides are a little bit rude.  On one hand, you did agree to the haircut.  Did you let her know that it was all dependant on price?  And on the other had, she should not make judgements about how much your family can afford to spend, and should have given you an estimate more in advance.|`|YV0hGLh0aa	yeah that is not very nice! Also just because you are not going doesn't mean they still cant go!|`|BPwpQV6faa	well i can see how on both sides of the party would feel what each said was rude. Maybe you should just say youre sorry that your parents wouldn't give you that much for a hair cut,and get over it. both of you. no need to not be friends oveir t.|`|9P0OxjWGaa	Yes - if your parents value money that is a good thing... She sounds very shallow.|`|qEH9dbT9aa	too rude. tell her you dont waste money like she does.|`|u6IY90Jbaa	very very rude|`|JSPTHPv2aa	no offense to her but it is rude! I agree! she shouldn't say things to a friend like that, it shows the true side of her that she isn't a good friend! u should go somewhere else to get a hair cut that is cheaper, but u r not cheap cuz ur parents r just tryin 2 save money and ur friend is spending and it sounds like she doesn't care about money. so u r right to save money not her! hope this helped!:)|`|kAAy44qCaa	that is rude just cuz ur parents have the money doesnt mean anything... and she still couldve gotten hers done or she can just find somewhere cheaper if u guys still want to do it together.|`|CDPRreHsaa	tell her to pay for her own damn haircut|`|1WXPDnYTaa	that is absolutely a rude thing to say, she has no right to call your parents cheap. it's reasonable for them to not want to pay a lot for a haircut, my parents don't want to either. plus she can always get the haircut by herself, she didn't have to cancel.|`|M0SLQimtaa	Hell no!  She's the rude one.  Tell her to read     "THE MILLIONAIRE NEXT DOOR"     by Stanley and Danko.  It's not your problem that your parents know how to be wealthy.|`|AvvMiIfHaa	Yes it was rude. Maybe she should look in to a class on etiquette and forget the haircut.|`|NEFvrWy6aa	Yea that is pretty rude for a so called friend to tell you that your parents are cheap and to they that you are rude it is your parents fault 4 not letting u go soo how is that rude of you|`|AoK8VWruaa	Defently she isn't even ur friend if it would be my opinion. That is very very rude!|`|8klN6Fokaa	I can understand her saying that you're rude for making her cancel the appointment. I think that you should have found out the cost before agreeing to go.     However, for her to say your parents are cheap, and that just because your dad is a lawyer he should be able to pay for your haircut is totally out of line. Personally I would not accept that kind of comment. If I were you I would reconsider who you consider your friends.     It doesn't matter if your father has money. He seems to be being wise about how he spends it, and that is a very good thing. So don't blame your father.     Anyway, your "friend" is out of line to say your parents are cheap. Sounds like she's a spoiled brat, if you don't mind me saying so.|`|PNA7f0q3aa	Well.. You gotta put yourself in her situation as well. I mean, i'd sorta get A LIL ticked off if someone were to cancel a plan of what i setted up, but i yes, it is abit rude for her to say that.|`|qL8f3rSsaa	Omg that is a wayyy rude comment. I would never say that to a friend, especially when most of it was my fault for not giving you the details in the first place! She  should have said the details before and if something is expensive and your parents don't feel that's a good price to pay, then that's not being cheap at ALL. If she had let you know the price in advance then you could have siad wheter you could go or not based off of that. I can understand what she was getting at, and why she said it, but its still a rude comment. Plus she doesn't have to cancel, she can go all by herself.|`|V6zzAi5Daa	I think this is incredibly rude! As a 17 yr old girl, if any of my friends said that to me i would seriously consider how much they were my "friend" (and tell them off). She has no right to say that your parents are cheap because they dont want to blow money on something silly like a haircut!-REGARDLESS OF THEIR PROFESSIONS!!- Deffinately re-consider who your true friends are, because true freinds deffinately would not say things like that!|`|WwKnro1vaa	I'd just forget about that place and never return. Yes, that was very rude. A customer has the right to know the costs of the service *before* said service is rendered and by saying "uhmmm... i dunno.... " she pretty much left you, the customer, with nothing to compare against competitive businesses. Or maybe she did this on purpose trying to not scare you away when you still could thinking that you won't turn her down when everything's ready. Well, you did and you're right.    As for her, saying things like that about you and your parents she makes it clear that she's just a greedy, unprofessional, ill-behaved you-know-what.    Don't regret and forget about this.|`|B5hbUmQwaa	Yes thats rude|`|ziPiHdcHaa	It is rude

AA10882246	Easy.  Follow along.    You - "Hey, have you ever taken a fiber supplement?"    Other - "No.  I mean my diet is pre---"  INTERRUPT  You - "Because I have been taking fiber pills for the last couple of days, and let me tell you, it's like a whole new world."    Other - "Oooookaaay..." (see, it's starting to get awkward right here...let's keep going)    You - "Yeah, originally I was a little afraid I was going to have to watch what I ate, you know, for fear or blowing an O-ring and ending up in the can all afternoon.  Instead, it's actually quite incredible."    Other - "umm...." (See, the awkward is growing now)    You - "It's like a no-wipe-****!  Seriously, I've never been that efficient in my life.  I can walk into the stall, drop trou, pound out the huckstables AND the extended family, and it's all in a matter of moments!  Completely painless."    At this point the other person should either be laughing, or awkwardly trying to walk away.      You - "Well enough about me, what about you?  (say this a little louder) Did you ever get that rash cleared up?  Oh, and speaking of rash, how's your mother these days?"    That should work nicely.

fCx4cUGtaa	Meanwhile, the Cornelii were traveling through Appian Way. Cornelius, because he wanted to arrive at the city in three days, was ordering Syrus to urge on the horses again and again. Therefore, Syrus was beating the horses with a stick. While they were going through the road, Aurelia and Cornelia were watching the peasants who were working in the fields. Marcus and Sextus were watching all the carriages that were going through Appian Way. It was the seventh hour. The day was hot. The peasants now weren't working in the fields, but were resting under trees. In the carriage, Cornelius and Aurelia were now sleeping. Marcus was annoying Cornelia, who wanted to sleep, with his foot. Sextus was sitting with the coachman Syrus.: road and...    Suddenly, Sextus yells," Look, Marcus! It's a charioteer!" Marcus responds with great laughter,"It's not a charioteer, stupid! It's a courier who carries distinguished citizen's letters from the city. Couriers always travel fast because they carry letters from the city to all parts of Italy." "How fast it was traveling!" shouts Sextus."He urges on the horses ferociously with a stick. Watch out for the courier, Syrus! Hold the horses! Watch out for the ditch! Watch out for the ditch!" Syrus holds the horses and avoids the courier, but the carriage goes down into a ditch with a loud crash.    I might be wrong on some parts but most of it is right. =]

RfGiuZ15aa	My boyfriend is 21 years younger than me and he did all the pursuing. He was only 18 when we first met. I spent a year trying to put him off but he wasn't having it. Finally, I gave in and thank my stars that I did. As it happened, my job and his studies soon separated us for much of the next 5 years. I thought it would be better for him if he found somebody who could be with him all the time and allow him a proper relationship but he wasn't having that either. So we finally got together in 1998 and have been together ever since. The funny thing is that he worries that I might leave him for somebody else. He's gorgeous and so talented I'm dead proud of him. Wild horses wouldn't make me leave  him.    Have you ever noticed in all the old black and white romance movies that the guy is always years older than the girl? I've never heard anyone complain about that even if it is only in the movies.  Is it ok for you at 19 to date a 36 year old guy? Of course it is, so long as you both get what you want out of it. Give it a go and remember that it's just a date unless you both find you want to take it further.|`|liQPH0nfaa	No.  Sounds pretty weird and gross.

You are over the age of consent so you are not a child anymore and the law considers you an adult now. What you do is your business. If you feel this is a relationship that could work out pursue it. Since your over 18 the decision is yours to make no one Else's. many young girls now days 18 to 24 are dating men well in there 40's and 50's so why should it be any different if you want to? Its your life, live it don't ask for permission to do what makes you happy.|`|h2RWWIzUaa	age is nothing but a number, you just want to be careful. me & my husband are 6 years apart, i knoe its nothing on that, but if & when you want to take it to the next level just be sure your okay with it mentally. older people are so much more muture than us younger people, not saying you dont know whats going on, im 20 & ive been through almost tha same stuff my husband has been through. just be sure its really what you want....& remember dating is ok!|`|gSiQOFHJaa	Technically, there's nothing wrong with that but I would ask you - What do you two have in common?

There is a point where the age difference begins to get iffy but for the most part age means nothing. I was 18 and dated a 36 yo guy for a few months. The only reason I couldn't stay in was the kids. Otherwise i would have. If your immature and don't know what you want then id say don't do it. But if your head is screwed on just right, go for it. Plus i'm sure the sex is damn good!!!

I'm torn here.  I'd love to say if the passion and love is there then it's fine.  But if you are looking to the future, to a lasting relationship then I think the age gap is just too great.  If it's a quick fling, a bit of fun, and you both know that, then I'd say it's fine.    I think my view is tainted by my being a 44yo who is still desperately searching for a life partner.|`|FgaBo4Eraa	While technically there's nothing illegal or immoral there you have to ask whether  both want the same things out of life, a 36 year old will be more mature and have a totally different outlook a 19 year old would very rarely be able to fit into the 36 year old's life and vice versa.    I personally as an 18 (19 in a month) year old guy wouldn't date above 25 and I know few people that would go higher than that even.|`|GJbziTG2aa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...|`|V5xHaIAcaa	sure|`|Z03zgM0maa	Absolutely not.

Or worse off? Love the column and podcast!    One Less Douche  Honoring my campsite rule doesn't merely require that you be honest, caring, open, and GGG, OLD.

6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	The default position is down.  More to the point, the default position is with the lid closed.  Since the lid cannot be closed without the seat down, then by extension it is down.  If it's one of those commodes where there is no lid, you still would put the seat down.  The aesthetic of the commode is designed for the seat down, as well.      It's the same for the toilet paper argument--over the top or underneath?   Best demonstrated with embossed designs or color pattern, went to pull out a length you should see the design.  If it unrolls from underneath, you are looking at the back side.  Over the top is correct.  Similarly, you aren't supposed to be looking at the underside of the toilet seat.|`|XmD61yBpaa	Leave it how you found it|`|hTr1dpTiaa	Well to be honest I wouldn't really notice if the toilet seat was down because it's just like oh here's a toilet let me pee in it.

DCPWT4feaa	"Learn to grammar," or, it's more popular colloquial spellings, "learn 2 grammar" or "L2 grammar," are certainly not grammatically correct sentences.    They are, however, both colloquially and ironically congruous to the original statement from which they are derived: "L2P," or "learn to play."  This highly popular abbreviated statement is "d00dspeak" found often in the online gaming community.    The question then becomes, "is it alright for a subculture to have a lexicon and linguistic set of rules all their own?"  We have forgiven colloquial speech as comical irony since the days of Mark Twain and before, and have a history of co-opting comedic phrases for political and cultural purposes since mass-media became a household standard.    I think the joy of the phrase, "learn to grammar" is its ironic congruity.  It makes fun of both itself and of the person it's targeted at by using improper grammar, both as an accusative example of bad grammar and as a recognition of the fact that our society has degraded (linguistically) to the point where "u talk 2 peeps @ gr8 spd" by jamming your thumbs into your Crackberry until the nerves fray.    Hang around online long enough and you will see the motif repeated.  "L2 read."  "Learn 2 spell."  "Learn to life."  It's the new "RTFM" ("read the [explitive] manual"), the popular saying back in the early days of home computing.|`|QsCPOHAraa	You're right, it's definitely not grammatically correct.

In my case, that means that in my next life I'm going to be a cockroach.  In Hitler's case, it's really hard to figure, because he was deliberately cruel to many sorts of people; but I think perhaps he was most bitterly cruel to those men for whom he felt a homosexual attraction--He was, on the evidence, a homosexual sadist.  We don't want to go into the nature of that evidence; but let us say that, if there is such a thing as a Law of Karma, by which our misdeeds are inexorably expiated, Hitler will be a man strangled with piano wire (a favorite Nazi method of execution, which takes about three days, and which was a special, personal predilection of Hitler's) in his next 10,000,000 incarnations.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	One of Hitler's ancestors was a Jew but he denied it.

Several different parishes of different denominations were asked to pray for the patients (given only their first name and last initial) for several minutes during their service.  The patients were then measured for length of stay in the hospital and complications due to the surgery.<br>  <br>  It was found that those who were not prayed for and those who were prayed for but did not know had identical numbers of hospital stay and complications.  On the other hand, those who did know that they were being prayed for actually had slightly longer stays and more surgical complications.

I would like to reccomend some practices that could help you when you feel the need to cut:    pressing a cube of ice to the area of skin you would normally cut.    drawing red marks on the area of skin you would normally cut.    using a biro to draw vicious X's into a pad of paper. this will help if you press hard and angry to get out all your dark feelings onto the paper.    you may also want to write words and sentences, draw or write poems in the pad. do not get scared if it turns out all gory and gothic, it means those feelins are outside you now and no longer festering inside.    I really hope you get through this, I'm sure your faith will help you.    feel free to send me a message if you have any more questions you would like advice on!

Of all the drugs I've done (the two you mentioned plus a VERY long list of others)- I would say that was one of the two that truly scared the crap out of me...  the other one was a prescription pill incident that made my body jerk around out of control after it kicked in (instead of just being a muscle relaxer).|`|2VFR5AKHaa	no, i have a freind who takes crack cocaine and herione, this is when he needs me most, losing or giving up on him would be the worst kind of thing ever.|`|d7311ef8a7db3a2d7bda7c310f13691caa	nope but i lost my best friend, a friend with whom i literally share a crib, to alcoholism.   alcoholism is the "disease of denial". she can't even admit she's sick so she won't get help for her illness and i can't allow her to abuse me anymore.  i love her.  i always have but she isn't really the person i love anymore.  it's like her body has been possessed by a rude, arrogant, totally selfish bytch.  the last time i looked into her eyes i didn't recognize the person i was looking at.  my hair stood on end, my stomach sank and my heart broke.  i knew in that instant that my best friend was gone gone gone.     strange how booze is legal yet highly addictive and physically and mentally destructive and drunk drivers kill more people every year than drug over doses but pot smokers go to jail for partaking in a bit of natural herb.|`|3sifr0MXaa	Yes...to Heroin.

Sia Furler ...The Girl You Lost To Cocaine....|`|WjRqYf6naa	Yes, I had completely given myself up to an addiction to crack cocaine. I was basically living in cheap motels or on the streets, spending my money on the rock rather than on food and shelter. When I did have a motel to crash in, I let the local hookers use my room to turn tricks or to get high in, in return for a share of their dope. I was emaciated, dirty and morally bankrupt. I even went so far as to steal from friends and family to fuel my habit.    I had been saved as a teenager, but at this point I wanted nothing to do with God or Jesus. Getting loaded was my life. I suffer from a major mental illness (Bipolar Disorder With Psychotic Features) and that was raging completely out of control, as I only went to the doctor to get Valium and such that I could trade for crack. I was not a nice person, and you wouldn't have liked me very much at all.    But then one night when i had reached the end of my rope, Jesus reached His hand down to me, and at the Bakersfield Rescue Mission I prayed with a counselor for Jesus to restore me to fellowship with Him. I can't claim that immediately all of the urges to get high left me, but it was the beginning of the climb back up out of the pit i had dug for myself Except for a one-time relapse in 2006 I have been clean since 2003.    I am now getting back to where I was before my fall. I have a good place to live and food on my table. I have good Christian friends who love and support me. My mental illness is now under control and I live a completely normal life.  I am growing in fellowship with the Lord.  Life is good.    Just recently i was able to reestablish contact with my children to whom I hadn't spoken in years because I was ashamed of how I had stolen from and scammed them. They forgave me, and I am preparing to move back to West Virginia later this year in order to be closer to them and my grandchildren, whom I have not yet met.    Heroin and cocaine are powerful, but there is One Who has all power. i heartily recommend Him to you. I am so glad that He never gave up on me    God bless.|`|HRvPoQzKaa	Yes I have.

If I could just do away with those I, too could become an enlightened atheist and start acting like a seventh grader again.|`|JfoWgwhoaa	They believe if it contradicts the Bible, it must be a lie.|`|lQtnQRlDaa	In my case it was social blackmail. It's pretty hard to get someone to see the truth, when it would mean being shunned by everyone they care about. Even a tiny glimpse of light, and your brain slams shut as a protection mechanism.    Thankfully I got over it and am making new friends. Wheew!|`|5oltZU5saa	Watching the village atheists rant and rave in their own delusions of reality while I thank and praise God for His objective reality and creation with its beauty and wonder.|`|1ehmRBruaa	Their weak little minds.|`|oMF6bXCZaa	I do not belong to a Christian Religion, but my answer to your question would be given as a question to you!    What prevents you from realizing that YOUR beliefs are ridiculous?    Everybody feel that they have the truth.  So how it be said that somebody else's beliefs are "ridiculous".  It is only your personal opinion, which does not make you right.|`|IDcIww7Baa	Ummmmm......yeah......they call it "faith"|`|aPtk8iEXaa	is that why you block some of us you don't like the truth?|`|avVdKiWKaa	We create our own reality, including whatever ideas one may harbor on the concept of what is ridiculous.  There is nothing wrong with believing in a kind and loving creator that you can "come home" to when you die.  On the finer points, e.g., the concept of a creator that is prone to genocide, hissy fits, insecurity complexes manifest in a need to be worshipped, all powerful yet demonstrably impotent, and creates plants before "he" creates the sun to drive photosynthesis, at that juncture I must tip my hat and exit stage left with alacrity.  One other fine point is that whatever reality one creates for oneself, it is only useful while you're sucking air.  Though your atoms will exist practically forever (we have yet to see a proton decay), I don't think there is much consciousness on the atomic level.  Although, you never know.  Studies have shown that our minds can influence things on the quantum level.  I won't go into detail, but such studies have been confirmed in more than one laboratory.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Punky, I understand that your opinion is that my beliefs as a Christian are ridiculous.  My own experience is different.  However, you've made it very clear how you feel about it.  Over and over again, I might add.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	lol.  "YOU".|`|NlzlBV8Haa	The fact that God reinforces them each day.    "Because of the LORD's great love we are not consumed,         for his compassions never fail.    They are new every morning;         great is your faithfulness."|`|G4SwEHP5aa	Ridiculous shortsighted bias questions like these.|`|AA12059478	I could ask the same thing about athiests.  They're christians.  They're happy.  Why are you bothering them?|`|p6wwiQG3aa	The fact that they are true    ridiculous one.|`|mSFjbetxaa	The fundie Christians suffer from an arterial flow problem above the neck.    Unfortunately, the fundies make all Christians look ridiculous.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	1. Fear of reality.   2. Fear of self responsibility  3.

We enjoy the laugh.|`|kaxHV1Mzaa	I agree with haunted chippy.|`|7NugugsDaa	YOU|`|WalnRzfGaa	God is in a good mood !- your right about not having the answers, but instead of just sticking with that and looking for the right ones, you make something up to replace it.    good thinking, lets not look for the answers but just say it was a universal overlord with a superiority complex.

In the UK I would ask to affirm.|`|sKMAuY8eaa	i always think about that.  you don't have to, but considering most people are religious I think that not swearing on it would sway the jury against you.|`|hYzfzu9yaa	No. That would be pretty pointless, wouldn't it? Thankfully, the courts have come to their senses and no longer use Bibles for swearing (unless requested).|`|S4XUl7qWaa	They don't use bibles in most courthouses anymore.<br>  <br>  Why just atheists?

So no.|`|GGGmoyNeaa	I was summonsed for jury duty last year and was sworn in on the bible(this is in Ireland). I wanted to be a part of the process so I went along with,it was an interesting case involving shotguns and attempted murder so I didn't want to make waves. About halfway through the trial at lunch with my fellow jurers my atheism and the being sworn in came up in conversation. It turns out I could have opted to affirm and take a secular oath. But the courts didn't let me know the option was open to me,they just assumed that I was Catholic(Ireland remember,majority are Catholic). Had I to do it again I would affirm.|`|sfTPrMFpaa	only if I wish to lie|`|b06d5f5c50bd7cf1d8a2a3aedfcc1c94aa	Of course not and I never have. You just affirm|`|9Ur1VL9Paa	No I would refuse; I would however be willing to swear on the constitution (it would seem more apropiate).<br>  <br>  I really don't see what exactly the bible has to do with a court trial.

People who don't believe in god also swear on the bible, to make people think they would tell the truth. It's convincing.|`|49c1ed9541d154d45ed38796a9a07ec3aa	i have done actually but i had to smirk when i did and from then things felt easier i find religion a joke so when a serious unsmiling freak comes up all serious with this stupid book you just gotta feel that bit superier he would have had the same affect if he approached me in a bunny suit its ridiculas so its kinda like being nervous about a speech and picturing everyone naked i was nervous till this jokester came up and told me to swear on a book haha oh no ill burn for eternity if i tell a lie i must follow the law made by man and man says i must burn hehe how i chuckle|`|xKthWOGtaa	I'm a Christian and I wouldn't swear on the bible.

They then promoted my history teacher to VP and Mrs. Petersen took over his class for the rest of the year. The next year she became my government teacher as well.     I liked her because she knew I had autism and she understood me. Instead of making me do things in front of the whole class, she would have me stay a few minutes after and have me do it one on one. Because of my autism anything social is really hard for me. She was the only teacher to get it, most would just leave me alone, but I wanted to be included. Its just it was so awkward and embarrassing to me that I would almost pass out when a teacher made us (mostly them) do things in front of others. I owe her a lot.|`|Vpk1nP7gaa	How can I choose one if I always be a teacher's pet?|`|uLHCY6Qmaa	Oh, yes! My favorite teacher has always been Miss Joan Moeller. English Literature and Drama.

I respect him a lot and he's the only teacher I had a strong bond with, because he never hesitated to be open with me Told me when I was wrong and have always appreciated me when I did something good. He made me realize my potential and that I have a good writing skill. He helped me develop some sort of confidence, and have always encouraged me to write and not be afraid of people who laugh at me for my speech defect. I would always go to him if I needed advice.    But my math teacher is not even a good teacher...and look at me!

Islam also teaches that self-harm is "haram" (sinful) which becoming fat from overeating and sedentary lifestyle is.<br>  <br>  Regardless of whether it is "sinful" or not in any religion, it's just not healthy to overeat and constantly eat bad 'junk' foods.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Actually, very cheap food makes you fat.

Who repects you more, and loves you more.    I now it's hard to even *think* about letting her go, but you just might have to. And if all doesn't go well, then she might break it with you.     Relationships aren't anything to toy with. Make up your mind, and go with it.|`|rbzYM2PXaa	Maybe she is bi and failing to admit it. No relationship is perfect, if someone told that theirs was they are lying. But in the mean time put her on the edge let her go for a little while to show her that you are someone to! Get out and mingle with some other friends and have sex  with them that way if you take her back you'll feel better and she'll think twice the next time she cheats.|`|iuJVYQVtaa	honestly, it's just a kiss. in that situation i would forgive and forget as long as she seems genuine in her apology. although she shouldn't use you being mean to her as an excuse to cheat. if she does there might be a problem    by the way, don't sleep around or make out with other people to get her back. or even say you did. it makes you just as bad as her. no one likes games played with them. you don't like it do you? then why would you do it to someone else. this isn't middle school, it's life.

That's why people are racist, sexist and homophobic. If the people you hate aren't like you then you can never be part of the problem (in your own eyes).    glbt people are a minority group and, therefore, are different from most (the "norm") and are an easy target for hatred.    No, it's not rational.

D9lMg7A2aa	Eusebius says that they knew Jesus prophecy and had already fled, some to Pella, others elsewhere.<br>  <br>  There is no report of the death of a Christian among the notices of the hundreds of thousands killed.

By that time Christians will have been raptured. Jesus was talking to the Jews....remember?|`|FOzN3xwzaa	That wasn't the fulfillment of those scriptures. <br>  <br>  The fulfillment is the future coming of antichrist.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	I am not that familiar with these particular verses, however, you ask: <<If the city was encircled how was it possible for Jesus followers to OBEY his command to flee to the mountains?>><br>  <br>  Realizet that a military encirclement is not complete and like every square inch of land is encircled.  Miliartily, when you encircle your enemy, generally, there are breaks in your encirclement. It generally means that in every direction, there is an enemy camp, and the enemy is running patrols around your city.  The enemy is in sufficient number that they can properly cover the perimeter and attack any part of the city at will.  They generally have roadblocks on every gate or road leading in. <br>  <br>  BUT, that does not mean no one can get by.  We can actually see this many times in military history that despite being besieged or encircled, often times the defenders are able to send out scouts to gather intelligence, and even get out messengers to call for reinforcements or get help from allies. <br>  <br>  So rarely is an encirclement total and impossible to breach,  militarily speaking. <br>  <br>  <br>  Lastly,  God could have easily assisted them and made sure they were not discovered as they made their escape. <br>  <br>  So you COULD say that Christians ALWAYS have a way out, in that they believe that God can intervene if it is his WILL to do so.|`|RTaimrg7aa	Most (If not all)  biblical prophecies have double meaning.  The first is that which applies to the current situation then there usually is a phrase that doesn't quite fit that is prophecy.  For example when Christ says "destroy this temple and I will rebuild it in three days"  The context was the actual temple but Jesus juxtaposed himself as the temple referring to himself rising in three days.  Your references are similar in character.  they may have been partially fulfilled in 66CE, and they may have been similarly fulfilled during the crusades or many other times.  The complete fulfillment is still to come.

I used to think it was a bad thing, but I'm not sure I see it that way anymore.    Before, women didn't work, and many of them didn't even drive. They were not independent, so, once they were married, they DEPENDED on their husbands for literally EVERYTHING. Unfortunately, men were still men and they cheated and had mistresses and all kinds of other things... but there was nothing that women could do about it back then, because, if they left them, they would be left with NOTHING. No money, no home... they couldn't get a job or drive or ANYTHING.     But now that women are more independent and have their own things... if a man messes up, they don't hesitate to leave; and if that means getting a divorce, then that's what has to happen. Men are now learning that they cannot just get away with anything like they did years ago anymore. And once they all learn that and stop trying to take advantage of good women, then there will probably be less divorces.    As far as everything else, I can only take a guess. There is MUCH more violence in the world now, so people don't take the opportunities to get to know their neighbors anymore. Also, since the economy is so bad, and there is so much pressure on people to look a certain way (since we have more advanced media than we had back then), it is creating eating disorders and people who are suicidal.
AA11262819	I agree, negatives can be proven, contrary to popular belief. In math, as you pointed out, negatives are proven quite frequently, such as the proof that there is no largest prime number. If something, such as the theistic God of Judeo/Christianity/Islam, cannot logically exist, then it does not, in fact, exist.

Thus, you are not in a position wherein you would have to "prove" it's non-existence. The claim of existence itself in your case is flawed and null: It disproves itself, so proving it doesn't exist is possible. This is not true of a hypothetical being that "could" exists but for which there is no evidence.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	Actually, what you are saying is fallacious. It's the same as the round square scenario.

funeSrxUaa	The disciples were excited because they stopped someone from casting out demons in the name of Jesus, because he was not part of their group.  They expected Jesus to congratulate them, yet instead, He rebuked them.  The reason He did it is found in the statement, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."  (Matthew 12:25 NIV)  In essence, they were dividing Christ's kingdom.<br>  We can apply this teaching today in the various and different denominations.  Just because they don't go to our church, or denomination does not mean they are heathenistic pigs.  Yet, the constant sophomoric bickering ie, "you don't believe the way I do therefore you're wrong." is doing a great disservice to the Kingdom of God.  <br>  Once Christians can understand that the war is not with the church down the street, but the war is with Satan, more for the Kingdom of God can be accomplished.  And as Augustine is credited with saying, "Where there are essentials let there be unity.  Where there are non essentials let there be liberty."<br>  No one can do a good thing for Christ and then turn around and say something bad about Him.  "But Jesus said, "Do not stop him, for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me." (Mark 9:39 ESV)|`|d62e178b99999cb7342212115b30d5bfaa	Thank you so much!!

The Crusades were in every way a defensive war. They were a direct response to Muslim aggression -- an attempt to turn back or defend against Muslim conquests of Christian lands.<br>  <br>  The West may now dominate the Islamic world, but that has only been the case since the late 18th century, when a young general, Napoleon Bonaparte, conquered Egypt and temporarily imposed French rule. This initial European penetration into one of the heartlands of Islam was "a terrible shock" to Muslims, says historian Bernard Lewis. Until then, they had thought of themselves as the victors in the Crusades.<br>  <br>  That assumption is understandable. Muslim rulers held the preponderance of power as far as Europe was concerned until the 17th century and had done so, more or less, since the Prophet Muhammad issued Islam's initial declaration of war against other religious faiths in the seventh century. The Prophet wrote the Christian Byzantine emperor and the Sassanid emperor of Persia to suggest they surrender to his rule because, well, their day was done. "I have now brought God's final message," the Prophet declared. "Your time has passed. Your beliefs are superceded. Accept my mission and my faith or resign or submit ... you are finished."<br>  <br>  This claim propelled the armies of Islam to take on the rest of the world. Muslim armies charged out of the Arabian Peninsula to conquer Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Egypt -- all of which, as part of the late Roman Empire, were officially Christian. By the eighth century, Christian North Africa was under Muslim control. <br>  <br>  Islam soon swept into Europe, grabbing Spain, Portugal and southern Italy. In the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks conquered much of Asia Minor, or Turkey.<br>  <br>  Here are some quick facts…<br>  <br>  The first Crusade began in 1095… 460 years after the first Christian city was overrun by Muslim armies, 457 years after Jerusalem was conquered by Muslim armies, 453 years after Egypt was taken by Muslim armies, 443 <br>  after Muslims first plundered Italy, 427 years after Muslim armies first laid siege to the Christian capital of Constantinople, 380 years after Spain was conquered by Muslim armies, 363 years after France was first attacked by Muslim armies, 249 years after Rome itself was sacked by a Muslim army, and only after centuries of church burnings, killings, enslavement and forced conversions of Christians.By the time the Crusades finally began, Muslim armies had conquered two-thirds of the Christian world.<br>  <br>  Europe had been harassed by Muslims since the first few years following Muhammad’s death. As early as 652, Muhammad’s followers launched raids on the island of Sicily, waging a full-scale occupation 200 years later <br>  that lasted almost a century and was punctuated by massacres, such as that at the town of Castrogiovanni, in which 8,000 Christians were put to death. In 1084, ten years before the first crusade, Muslims staged another devastating Sicilian raid, burning churches in Reggio, enslaving monks and raping an abbey of nuns before carrying them into captivity. <br>  <br>  In theory, the Crusades were provoked by the harassment of Christian pilgrims from Europe to the Holy Land, in which many were kidnapped, molested, forcibly converted to Islam or even killed. (Compare this to Islam’s justification for slaughter on the basis of Muslims being denied access to the Meccan pilgrimage in Muhammad’s time).<br>  <br>  The Crusaders only invaded lands that were Christian. They never attacked Saudi Arabia or sacked Mecca as the Muslims had done (and continued doing) to Italy and Constantinople.<br>  <br>  The period of Crusader “occupation” (of its own former land) was stretched over less than two centuries. The Muslim occupation is in its 1,372nd year.<br>  <br>  The period of Crusader “aggression” compresses to about 20 years of actual military campaign, much of which was spent on organization and travel. (They were from 1098-1099, 1146-1148, 1188-1192, 1201-1204, 1218-1221, 1228-1229, and 1248-1250). By comparison, the Muslim Jihad against the island of Sicily alone lasted 75 grinding years.<br>  <br>  Christian Europe certainly fought back. In the eighth century, campaigns to recover the Iberian peninsula began, but it wasn't until the end of the 15th century that the Reconquista swept Islam out of Spain and Portugal. Other counterattacks were made, the most famous of which were the war-pilgrimages known as the Crusades.<br>  <br>  In 1095, Pope Urban II called for he First Crusade. He urged Europeans to aid fellow Christians who were being slaughtered by Muslims. "They (the Muslim Turks) have invaded the The Crusades were a response to more than four centuries of conquests in which Muslims had already captured two-thirds of the old Christian world. At some point, Christianity as a faith and a culture had to defend itself or be subsumed by Islam.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, subsequent Crusades over the next three centuries weren't as successful. By the enend of the 13th century, the Christian Crusaders had been chased from the Middle East. From then on the concern was no longer about reclaiming Christian homelands, but about saving Europe.<br>  <br>  In 1453, Muslims captured the capital of the Byzantine Empire, Constantinople (or Istanbul, as it is now known). In the late 15th century, Rome was evacuated when Muslim armies landed at Otranto in an unsuccessful invasion of Italy. By the 16th century, the Ottoman Turk empire stretched from North Africa and Arabia to the Near East and Asia Minor. They penetrated deep into Europe, conquering Greece, Bulgaria, Hungary, Albania, Croatia and Serbia. In 1529, the Ottomans laid siege to Vienna. Luckily for Europe, the siege failed; otherwise the door to Germany would have been open. It wasn't until 1572, when the Catholic Holy League defeated the Ottoman fleet at Lepanto, that Islam's threat to the West finally ended, at least until the late 20th century when the doors to Europe were once again opened to Muslims.<br>  <br>  Unlike Jihad, the Crusades were never justified on the basis of New Testament teachings. This is why they are an anomaly, the brief interruption of fourteen centuries of relentless Jihad against Christianity that began long before the Crusades and continued well after they were over. <br>  <br>  Islam unquestionably won the Crusades, even though Europe was ultimately able to reassert itself and dominate the world. The reasons for this success are much debated, but it's reasonable to conclude that the West won the war of ideas. Notions of individualism and freedom, capitalism and technology, and, most of all, the West's turn from theology to science, carried the day. Religion became in the West an essentially private concern. It is on this "modern" turn that the anti-Crusade attitude developed.<br>  <br>  During the Protestant Reformation, when the authority of the Catholic church was under attack, the Crusades began to be regarded as a ploy by power-hungry popes and land-hungry aristocrats. This judgment was extended by the Enlightenment philosophes, who used the Crusades as a cudgel with which to beat the church. The Enlightenment view of the Crusades still holds sway. After the Second World War, with western intellectuals feeling guilty about imperialism and European politicians desperate to abandon colonial responsibilities, the Crusades became intellectually unfashionable.<br>  <br>  Historian Steven Runciman reflected this attitude in his three-volume study, A History of the Crusades, published in the early 1950s. He cast the Crusades as "morally repugnant acts of intolerance in the name of <br>  God," says Madden. "Almost single-handedly Runciman managed to define the modern popular view of the Crusades."<br>  <br>  The greatest crime of the Crusaders was the sacking of Jerusalem, in which 30,000 people were said to have been massacred. This number is dwarfed by the number of Jihad victims, from India to Constantinople and Narbonne, but Muslims have never apologized for their crimes and never will. <br>  <br>  What is called 'sin and excess' by other religions, is what Islam refers to as the will of Allah

Just because now everyone knows she didn't have lunch money?

yzgS5KiQaa	I know right *sighs*. People act like heterosexuality an homosexuality are two totally different things.

That's why when I get this question (and other related and equally ignorant questions), I ask the same question back to the asker. You'd be surprised how many blank stares I get. It seems people have NEVER gone through the mental exercise of questioning themselves about such topics before asking someone else and looking like a total boob.|`|8TmK8Qklaa	This answer won't last long but here it is --    Heterosexuality is an unnecessary term. It was only when sexuality was being redefined to suit the many perversions in social culture that we even had to come up with it.    You have to have heterosexual as as class because we have added homosexual and everything needs something to compare to so that we can create these nifty labels.    As far as the failing education, more and more schools are accepting media sources as facts and theories are being taught as if they were laws.  You should be happy that right now those sources are on your side.    I hope you can be tolerant enough with my answer as much as everyone who agrees with you.  I would think that I deserve the same rights.    btw-- I am male who fits beautifully inside a female, I can produce sperm that can fertilize the female egg and produce offspring from us both. That labels me as a straight man in today's society.    does that answer work for you?|`|0121db3d89fa7258a5d230763048afc9aa	I'm gay b/c I like it!|`|a432b51e0a46f5957270f47cd8423553aa	ITs pretty simple buddy.

You're so right!|`|ROVhLgH7aa	Because some of them are curious, ignorant or just plain funny, not stupid, but funny. I would normally ask them the question in reverse like "Why are you str8?" or "Who wants to know?". You will find out that some folks themselves are gay or bi themselves but dont know how to handle so instead of just having coversation and seek help on how to deal with their issue, they bully you or make fun. **** I love women BUT gay sex with a strong sexual man is soooo HOT!    So if I were you, just ignore them and move on. I know, I know, it bugs you but your being smart is another person's ignorance|`|HgRYP3cJaa	So very true.  Ppl think gay males are sex addicts or bi-girls are sluts.  It's stupid to have to defend who you choose to love.    Be proud of who you are. Ask them why they're straight!
f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	In principle, the idea is that you leave them on as long as they naturally remain, making no effort to proactively remove them, but neither taking special measures to preserve them.<br>  <br>  For example, they will likely come off when you take a shower/bath and wash your hair.  You are under no obligation to attempt to preserve them when you do so.  You are also under no obligation to wash them off pro-actively at a certain time.|`|UpPWXRK4aa	I would think you leave them on until you wash your face at night or shower, to show everyone of your faith?

However, my mother was devout, and wore the ashes until 12:01 A.M. of the next day (in other words, she wouldn't remove them until Ash Wednesday was really over). I don't honestly know if there's a set rule about it, but many people wash the ashes off (often with a makeup remover towelette) after the service is done.|`|38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	I went to noon Mass and have already removed the ashes here at 3:30 because they were starting to irritate my skin. <br>  <br>  If you're comfortable letting the ashes stay where they are until the end of the day, why not let them remain? It's a quiet reminder to others around you that today is a special day. But if you've got allergies like I do or you aren't comfortable letting the ashes remain, go ahead and wash them off.<br>  <br>  It's between you and God anyway, so don't worry about what someone else thinks.

7XSMjgroaa	For preachers to teach that there is absolutely no free will is pure ignorance. If we were given no free will, then hell wouldn't exist and Jesus wouldn't have had to die on the cross for our sins. It's because Jesus gave us free will that we can choose whether or not we want to accept the Gospel. If we choose to, then we go to Heaven. If we choose to continue to sin against God and not accept what he says to be the truth, then we go to Hell.|`|atfKCzmPaa	The Wonderful Gift of Free Will--TO UNDERSTAND why God has permitted suffering and what he will do about it, we need to appreciate how he made us. He did more than create us with just a body and a brain. He also created us with special mental and emotional qualities. A key part of our mental and emotional makeup is free will. Yes, God implanted in us the faculty of freedom of choice. It was indeed a wonderful gift from him.<br>  How We Are Made-- Let us consider how free will is involved in God’s permission of suffering. To begin with, think about this: Do you appreciate having the freedom to choose what you will do and say, what you will eat and wear, what kind of work you will do, and where and how you will live? Or would you want someone to dictate your every word and action every moment of your life? No normal person wants his life taken out of his control so completely. Why not? Because of the way God made us. The Bible tells us that God created man in his ‘image and likeness,’ and one of the faculties God himself has is freedom of choice. (Genesis 1:26; Deuteronomy 7:6) When he created humans, he gave them that same wonderful faculty—the gift of free will. That is one reason why we find it frustrating to be enslaved by oppressive rulers. So the desire for freedom is no accident, for God is a God of freedom. The Bible says: “Where the spirit of Jehovah is, there is freedom.” (2?Corinthians 3:17) Hence, God gave us free will as part of our very makeup. Since he knew the way our minds and emotions would work, he knew that we would be happiest with free will. To go with the gift of free will, God gave us the ability to think, weigh matters, make decisions, and know right from wrong. (Hebrews 5:14) Thus, free will was to be based on intelligent choice. We were not made like mindless robots having no will of their own. Nor were we created to act out of instinct as were the animals. Instead, our marvelous brain was designed to work in harmony with our freedom of choice.<br>  The Best Start-- To show how caring God was, along with the gift of free will, our first parents, Adam and Eve, were given everything that anyone could reasonably want. They were put in a large, parklike paradise. They had material abundance. They had perfect minds and bodies, so they would not have to get old or get sick or die—they could have lived forever. They would have had perfect children who could also have had a happy, everlasting future. And the expanding population would have had the satisfying work of eventually turning the entire earth into a paradise.—Genesis 1:26-30; 2:15. Regarding what was provided, the Bible relates: “God saw everything he had made and, look! it was very good.” (Genesis 1:31) The Bible also says of God: “Perfect is his activity.” (Deuteronomy 32:4) Yes, the Creator gave the human family a perfect start. It could not have been better. What a caring God he proved to be!<br>  Freedom Within Limits-- However, did God purpose for free will to be without limits? Imagine a busy city without any traffic laws, where everybody could drive in any direction at any speed. Would you want to drive under those conditions? No, that would be traffic anarchy and would surely result in many accidents. So too with God’s gift of free will. Unlimited freedom would mean anarchy in society. There have to be laws to guide human activities. God’s Word says: “Behave like free men, and never use your freedom as an excuse for wickedness.” (1?Peter 2:16, JB) God wants free will to be regulated for the common good. He purposed for us to have, not total freedom, but relative freedom, subject to the rule of law.<br>  Whose Laws?-- Whose laws were we designed to obey? Another part of the text at 1?Peter 2:16?(JB) states: “You are slaves of no one except God.” This does not mean an oppressive slavery, but, rather, it means that we were designed to be happiest when in subjection to God’s laws. (Matthew 22:35-40) His laws, more than any laws devised by humans, provide the best guide. “I, Jehovah, am your God, the One teaching you to benefit yourself, the One causing you to tread in the way in which you should walk.”—Isaiah 48:17.<br>  At the same time, God’s laws allow for great freedom of choice within their boundaries. This results in variety and makes the human family fascinating. Think of the different types of food, clothing, music, art, and homes throughout the world. We surely prefer to have our choice in such matters rather than have some other person decide for us. Thus we were created to be happiest when subject to God’s laws for human behavior. It is similar to being subject to God’s physical laws. For instance, if we ignore the law of gravity and jump off a high place, we will be injured or killed. If we ignore the internal laws of our body and stop eating food, drinking water, or breathing air, we will die. As surely as we were created with the need to submit to God’s physical laws, we were created with the need to submit to God’s moral and social laws!|`|823Z8NH3aa	Actually, God did give humans free will, that's what makes us different from animals!

Buying styles that would compliment his body shape as you say you play sports some styles might not accommodate the muscles built by what ever sport your into.

She told me that her mom said that she couldn't sit around or be friends with white people. <br>  <br>  As I got older, the more I heard racist comments coming from both blacks and whites. I am 17 and have been told by blacks that I am a cracker who is selfish and discriminatory. They tell me that I am rich and that one day they will rule the world and make white people slaves. At the same time, I heard whites saying that they should go back to Africa, black people are monkeys that lie, cheat, and steal. <br>  <br>  So yes, there definitely is a rivalry between whites and blacks.

38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	It's all right. If you didn't know about fasting on Ash Wednesday and not eating meat, you haven't done anything wrong. It seems a little odd that you never heard of that, but things can and do slip by us. <br>  <br>  People over the age of 18 are expecting to fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. That means one full meal and two smaller ones that together don't add up to a full meal. There's also no snacking between meals, although beverages are OK. So if you aren't 18 yet, the rule about fasting doesn't apply to you anyway.<br>  <br>  Everyone over the age of 14 and who haven't reached their 59th birthday are expected to abstain from eating meat on those two days, as well as every Friday in Lent. So anything made with beef, pork, chicken, or other fowl is off limits. There's some debate about whether soups and gravies flavored with meat are acceptable or not: personally, I try to avoid them.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: if you're not over 14, you don't have to abstain, and if you're not over 18 you don't have to fast. If your conscience bothers you, talk to a priest about it, but since you didn't know about the rules, I don't think any sin was involved.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Forgot to mention that even when the days of fasting and abstaining are in effect, if you do heavy work, have a medical condition such as diabetes, or there are other extenuating circumstances, you are not bound to observe the Lenten rules.<br>  <br>  If you've got questions about fasting and abstaining, talk to your priest.|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	Ash Wednesday is a day of abstinence and fasting. No meat, and only one regular meal and two small meals.|`|lNtwpzpOaa	Yes, we are supposed to fast on Ash Wednesday.<br>  <br>  At 14, you are supposed to abstain from meat on Ash Wednesday and on Fridays, but when you are 18 start fasting on Ash Wednesday (and also no meat today) and on Good Friday. Those are the only two days you are supposed to fast. <br>  <br>  If you're not 14, then you are excused from eating meat and if you're not 18, you are excused from fasting. <br>  <br>  Don't feel bad, you didn't know that you were breaking Lent, but your friend shouldn't have made fun of you, you friend should've reminded you and told you that this is what we do.|`|tpDICzslaa	There are two days which the church has designated as compulsory days of fasting and abstenance - Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. However the requirements are less strict for those under the age of 18, so you might not technically have done anything wrong.<br>  <br>  In any case, if you were genuinely ignorant about the church's requirements then what you did would not count as a serious sin. Those who should have given you clear instruction and did not would be more greatly at fault.|`|PsN79isyaa	First don't over do feeling bad. Mistakes happen. Although taking the heat from friends can seem soul searing. GOD understands honest mistakes, and of course will not hold this against you.<br>  <br>  As you already know "rules" - just plan ahead and enjoy Lent. Peace.

bQVCYSbWaa	Ok, I am also uncomfortable naked. What I am working on is being naked in places in my own home, alone. First, bathroom for maybe 10 minutes, then 20, etc. Then work on your room, a computer room, anyplace without windows, so you don't get brought up on indecent exposure charges. Just do this until you're more comfortable. Hopes it works for you too, it's working for me!|`|1ThWEediaa	I think you need a person who makes you feel better in that way because that's the only way that you can fight against the problem and try to make it something normal like in  your house................................GOO... LUCK.|`|ynCJxyagaa	I think that you need to become accustomed to the fact that naked is the normal state.  That's the way I am most of the time around the house unless I need to put on clothes to stay warm or am preparing to go out. Get comfortable with yourself.  Taking your clothes off is not sexy or risque; it's just a practical response to the situation.  There are places where they are not needed.|`|AA10554882	Do you live alone?    One piece of advice that I would give would be to practice being in the nude more while alone at home - when you know no one will be coming in. Cook naked (not when you're frying!) walk around naked. Sleep naked. Maybe watch a little tv naked. -Again - only when you know you will have privacy.    I do this a bit more often these days, and I'm not someone who has to be nude around others often, or at all actually, save my boyfriend, but I have definitely found that it has improved my self-confidence a bit.     The road to improvement started from within, so where better to practice than in the comfort of your own home.     Hopefully this helps, all the best.|`|AA11971497	I agree with the others about becoming more accustomed to being naked when alone at home.  But you might find it useful to face your fear head on by going to a nude beach or resort and just doing it (getting naked).  Walk away from your clothes and you'll be surprised how quickly everything becomes OK.  In a very short time, you'll be cured.    For the first few minutes, while your brain is still shorting out, you might get an erection.  Put a towel or something on you lap and just dare yourself to be as hard as you can.  But pretty soon, as you calm down and realize that it's not a sexual situation and that it's socially not acceptable there, you'll be back to normal.  Read a book, go for a swim, live your life.
mU2eMSi3aa	This question makes your head go for loops but I would have to say the first one.  <br>  Hope is a feel good thing but with more possibility of it being wrong you have greater ability to detach yourself from it if it does go wrong.  If you have less hope but bank on your confidence that it is really truth you have just tied yourself completely to the idea and will crash and burn with it.  <br>  Such as when I was completely devoted to my religion is was my life and I would have died for it because I was confident that it was the absolute truth but when I grew up and saw that there were many other ideas out there my confidence grew more towards just hoping that it was true and therefore I was able to let go of false confidence more effectively.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	I don't know if anythings ever going to happen with Hope, but I like her more or less.|`|oGVvEl3Maa	are you implying that a great hope has less possibility of truth?<br>  are you implying that a smaller hope has more confidence in the truth?<br>  <br>  faith leads to hope...<br>  hope leads to love.<br>  <br>  the three are intertwined.<br>  <br>  i would rather choose a great faith... in order to have more hope... and therefore a greater love.  if you have no faith in the truth... you will have little hope for anything else... and all that is left is despair. [3:73]|`|AA12391873	I have always looked to what is real...hope, belief, imaginings just aren't real. Included in belief is the belief in a religion, science or fantasy.

AA11923447	It's because there are very few religions or cultures which prize arrogance as a positive trait. Seriously, why would humility be seen as something wrong?|`|AA11849917	Are you implying by your question that you are NOT humble, but proud, arrogant and presumptuous, and the accompanying trait of obnoxious that generally goes along with the other traits?  (These are the opposite of "humble", by the way.)|`|8OpFYoO4aa	"Pride goes before destruction,<br>  And a haughty spirit before stumbling." ~ Proverbs 16:18|`|39rXZUeQaa	Back in the day, I'm guessing it was so people wouldn't rise up and challenge the Church's authority. Preaching humility was one way to keep the masses quiet.|`|pxgIsS0Maa	Because everyone else is teaching humanity.|`|1wQeH0hdaa	No its because he wants us to ignore things like you..|`|mo4MnsX7aa	Humility simply means that we should see ourselves as God sees us.  It does not mean that we need to belittle ourselves beneath our actual place in the universe.  We have arrogant people to belittle us.  It does not mean that we should see ourselves are far exalted above our place in the universe.  Arrogant people seem to have that in hand as well.  It merely means that we are to see ourselves as we are.  Seems to me that a bit of reality never hurts mature adults.  I wonder who that leaves to be arrogant.<br>  <br>  Actually, a moron can be very good at doing a single simple task.  Psychologically, the term was used for "a person of mild mental retardation having a mental age of from 7 to 12 years and generally having communication and social skills enabling some degree of academic or vocational education."  They would be very good at getting on the internet, but they would probably act in an inappropriate manner while there.  The term is no longer used in psychology as it is seen as offensive.  Fortunately, we have the internet to keep it around.|`|9QeV07zJaa	It's completely about control. This is not about what God wants to control this is about what religious leaders or founders want to control . . .  you!|`|AA11647647	I think the real question is how come they preach it but never practice it.
WpBqlEW5aa	I am 27 years old now, but I was just like you when I was that age. I have NEVER been great at liking myself (body image, mind, spirit...anything) and I suck at accepting compliments. I was made to go to the dances by my mom. She thought that's just what you did as a girl at this age. So, I went...to make her happy. Now, YOU are having to go to make your school happy...same thing. First thing I would advise...DO NOT shop with your mother, aunt, grandma, etc. They are going to say you look great, no matter what. Shop with a good friend that you know will tell you EXACTLY what you look like, no matter what. Though it may be hard to listen to, suck it up and take the critiscim or the nice comments...whichever come out. Do you have a favorite color? Pick dresses in that color. Or, pick dresses that go with your eyes. For instance, blue eyes go great with pink dresses or blue dresses...green eyes and dark hair go great with dark red dresses, gold, or green dresses...etc etc. Look it up and see what you come up with! Next, try on SEVERAL dresses...I mean SEVERAL until you find something that makes your friend say wow and you at least smile into the mirror! Once you find it, try on a couple more after that. If they don't do that same thing for you, get that one! After you take it home, show NOBODY! Only you and that friend can see it until the night of the dance. Once your hair and all is done, and make up is on, then present yourself. Once you hear all the comments and such, you will feel good about yourself, if only for that night. Tell yourself that yes, I picked a dress that I KNOW goes with ME...I did my hair and I did my make up...yes, I look pretty!   It may sound corny...but it does work! When you get to the dance, maybe dance a dance or two (or not) and just see where it leads!|`|Bctc0cEEaa	you'll look fine, just be confident, dances are always fun if you stick with your friends|`|NiWX109paa	Be your self and the most important thing is to have fun.|`|AA11435910	8th Grade right.  Well not too many people will be dancing. Mostly the girls will be in a huddle talking and the guys will be in a huddle across the room talking. I do not think a dress in necessary. Just dress up.

WwCBomTMaa	We celebrate Jesus in general. Notice that we have a holiday celebrating his birth, another celebrating his resurrection yet no holidays celebrating his death. The reason why we wear crosses is to be constantly reminded that he died for our sins.|`|AA11008046	The death, burial, and ressurection of Jesus Christ is the cornerstone of the Christian Faith.|`|TzY9vkinaa	My church doesnt, but I understand why other Christians do. Christ died for our sins.|`|AA11622701	If you read through the New Testament, you will find that the death of Jesus is the central theme of the Christian teaching.  It is not his miracles, his healing, his lifestyle, or even his teachings that are consider to be the source of salvation.  It is his sacrificial death. <br>  <br>  If you look at the gospels, half of each of them deal with the last seven days of his life, with his death occupying the majority of that.  There are more verses about his death then about his teachings.<br>  <br>  Paul makes the death (and resurrection) of Christ the center of his writings.  There are almost no mentions of Jesus' teachings because without his sacrificial death, his teachings would be no more important than those any of the hundreds of other "prophets" over the centuries.  <br>  <br>  It is through the death of Jesus that man is made right with God, salvation is made possible, and a person is reborn.  That is why the death of Jesus receives a higher emphasis in the Christian faith than anything else.|`|HG5Smxkjaa	The emphasis is on his resurrection...not his death....We celebrate his resurrection because he paid a high price in order to save us....|`|g4AAZRuxaa	They remember is death in Communion.|`|dOkw3xhcaa	I believe we celebrate His RESURRECTION|`|ptIIkqq0aa	There is such an emphasis because Christ died on the cross for our sins, the ultimate sacrifice.

That may also be because when Jesus was on the cross, he shed his blood for our sins which saves us from sins. Also, Christians emphasize on his death because he needed to die to rise again and show that he conquered death and sin. Now that he died and rose again, people can pray for forgiveness instead of sacrificing a lot. Even though it seems that death is a bad thing, Jesus was different and fulfils the prophecy.|`|gTGuTfh0aa	Christians believe that through God's death on the cross - a most painful and de-meaning death 'cursed is he who is hung on a tree' though he was pure and sinless he took the punishment for peoples sins aka bad stuff.

But even more we celebrate him coming out of that death, defeating it!|`|v7G1dmgXaa	His death opened the doors for mankind's forgiveness.<br>  It also ended animal sacrifices.<br>  And yes! It was his command!|`|uV4eDIaQaa	they celebrate it because he died for our sins...but really, they celebrate his rising more because it shows that he defeated death. of course people still physically die but we have a chance to receive eternal life.|`|JREs9K0Gaa	His death and resurrection brought about the plan of salvation for those who will accept it.|`|DWh9Rjn8aa	easter is an emphesis on his resurection and his accendence to heaven not his death|`|CBKjEvp5aa	Because he paid the "ultimate sacrifice".

KFtxaISsaa	The past participle can be used in:      __Present Perfect - Pretrito Perfecto Compuesto:    I HAVE GONE to Brazil  Yo HE VIAJADO a Brazil     * Expresses a fact that has just been checked at the time of speaking, or a fact whose circumstances or consequences have a sense of connection with the present (in theory).  Usage: It referres to an action in an indeterminated time, which may be at the past or at the present. When it happened, it doesn't matter. (Thats how I use it)    __Past Perfect  Pretrito Pluscuamperfecto:    I HAD PHONED home  Yo HABA LLAMADO  a casa     I arrived home. Previously, I had phoned home.    * It indicates a past action that had happened before another action that has been named.    __Pretrito anterior:    I HAD DONE a task - Yo HUBE HECHO una tarea     After the rain had passed, I went out - Luego de que la lluvia hubiera pasado, sal.    *Denotes a previous past action which has happened immediately before another one.  It isnt used in oral speaking. In general, its replaced by Pretrito Pluscuamperfecto.  Its always used in the same sentence as the past action: it is in a close.    (Also, the past simple is used in Futuro Perfecto and Condicional Perfecto, which I skip because I suppose you dont know yet.)|`|a3j82sBpaa	In everyday Spanish we scarcely use past participle. In English you use it to mean the "past of the past", and for Spanish speakers is really hard to understand. The "problem" we have is that we tend to use simple past for everything. I'll explain it for you. Properly speaking we should say:   Hube ido al mercado antes de ir al colegio.   Instead, we say:   Fu al mercado antes de ir al colegio.     If you use the first form, the listener will raise his eyebrows.     The translation for that is:   I had gone to the market before I went to school.     Memorize the structure just for your grammar exams. Then, forget about it.

There are some stories that claim that the sirens who so nearly ensnared Odysseus were actually mermaids. Many mermaids are attributed this power to make any man within hearing distance of their enchanting song fall madly in love with them, most often to their own detriment. It is also reasonable to consider the ability to breathe both in and out of water a power. We know that if they do exist they would have to live in the deepest parts of the ocean since only those would be safe from human interference so they are either able to regulate their own body heat on an incredible scale or they are cold blooded, in either case that would be quite a feat for a mammal. We must all agree they are mammals since they are always pictures as creatures possessing mammary glands. Since stories of fairies often claim that they are unable to enter water and even those who are able to enter water are never in sea water, it seems likely that merpeople would have a purpose having something to do with the preservation of life in the ocean realm as fairies have with the land based life.|`|0TTZERJmaa	sorry but mermaids aren't real it would be nice if they were. <br>  <br>  but if they were i think they would have the power to change water currents and stuff.<br>  <br>  i think seaside stuff like shells and starfish skeletons and fossils remind me of mermaids.|`|JMOLRKRraa	Mermaids have no real noted powers.

But the issue is not whether these things occur, but what they are.<br>  <br>  Research of UFO abductees has led to some interesting discoveries. According to those abducted, the aliens are teaching theology. The curious thing is that the theology is New Age theology; namely, that we are all divine, all evolving to higher levels of consciousness, that reality is what you perceive it to be, etc. These are anti-Christian teachings. In some cases, comments about Jesus himself have been made that directly contradict biblical revelation. I've studied the New Age for quite some time, and a great many people in the New Age not only accept Aliens and UFO's, but teach that they are more highly evolved than we are and that we need to learn from them.<br>  <br>  In addition, an inordinately high percentage of the abductees have had previous experience with the occult. I remember when I was younger and into séances, necromancy, psycho kinesis, and astral projection. One night I looked into the sky and saw a very bright light that moved at an extremely high rate of speed and made sudden and sever changes in direction during its flight. It moved extremely fast and accelerated out of sight as it moved high into the night sky and disappeared. I saw this with my own eyes. But it doesn't stop there. During my occult days, I also saw many other unusual manifestations, heard voices, and saw things move. I could go on. But suffice it to say, that I confirm the findings that those who experience UFO phenomena are very often involved in the occult. This is alarming and a major warning.<br>  <br>  My conclusion is that the UFO phenomena is occultic in origin and demonically based. I do not believe there is life on other planets and I suspect that what has manifested is nothing more than a great deception that is slowing enveloping mankind.|`|h8rn6CNtaa	i don't think we should be arrogant enough to think that we are the only ones in tyhe universe. we may or may not be the only ones in the milky way but the universe is a big place. the point is ...we don't know but should not assume we are the only ones. i'm a christian by the way.|`|lh2hEzoMaa	You need fact not opinions on the start of life and aliens?

There aren't even facts available that god EXISTS, let alone whether or not he made life on other planets.<br>  <br>  The existence of life on this planet implies that life exists on other planets as well.

AA11923447	If you do not wish to participate in Ash Wednesday rites, then by all means don't. However, for some people, it is a highly meaningful ritual. The ashes on the head are symbolic of penance, and are also a reminder of mortality. The comment about little boys is so low that it warrants no additional commentary. You're not Catholic?

He got A's in other courses but nothing but C's in math.  His parents became very frustrated and finally decided to send him to the local Catholic school.  He suddenly began to get straight A's in math class.  One day his father asked him, "Son we're very happy about your grades, but curious why the sudden change?"<br>  <br>  The boy responded, "I don't like math but when I saw that guy on the wall nailed to the plus sign I figured the teachers weren't fooling around!"|`|rPv7PU9Iaa	Ok, well I'm a thirteen year old DEVOUT catholic and Catholics are most certainly not crazy. You put ashes on your head to symbolise the whole "ashes to ashes, dust to dust" thing. <br>  And it has nothing to do with math, we wear a cross on our head. If you don't know what a cross is, it's what Jesus, the saviour of the earth, was put to death on by the Romans. He was put to death on good Friday and was buried. Then he rose from the dead on Easter Sunday. His tomb was found empty by three women- Salome, Joanna and Mary. That's why we celebrate. It's because we now know that there is life after death.<br>  We're not a cult or anything!!!|`|z74a7wvlaa	Honey bluffball,<br>  The ash + cross is telling you: Dust thou art, to dust returneth; meaning you will die without knowing when, hence repent and do Jesus' way.

FOzN3xwzaa	Once saved always saved is the Gospel of Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  Jesus DOES give ETERNAL LIFE. And we're all still sinners, even after salvation. <br>  <br>  Trust the Words of the Lord Jesus. It is IMPOSSIBLE to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  In other words, until a person believes that what he has received from the Lord Jesus is permanent and cannot be lost, he might not yet be born again. A person cannot believe in Christ alone for his eternal destiny and also believe that he must do something (or avoid doing something) to keep it.<br>  <br>  As for the baptism of the Holy Spirit, that is real, and the Holy Spirit baptism comes either immediately when you believe in Jesus, or you can ask for the Holy Spirit baptism anytime after  :)|`|38852752ccd0ae855afeb5b23f504950aa	I am charismatic by church.<br>  A new testamant church 1Tim 4:11-16,Hebrew 10:24-25<br>  Godhead, of the father,son and the holy spirit matthew 28:18-20<br>  Jesus is the son of God,rose from the dead <br>  Acts 2:22-28<br>  Gain salvation one must be born again<br>  John 3:3<br>  Those are a few of them|`|zvafRreyaa	Mine Fuhrer CJ has given up his Avatar and name for Lent ...He would now like you to call him Jesus is Lord...Don’t you like him In his Easter Dress and Pointy hat along with his Easter Message.|`|v7G1dmgXaa	<a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/jt/article_03.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/jt/article_0...</a>|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	I recommend Baptist.

Normally,  once a person is saved, he has a strong desire to serve God so would not consider those things.    I do believe that "once saved, always saved".  <br>  Romans 8:38,39 (nothing can separate you from the love of God).|`|vvgodUChaa	check out realanswers.net they are not a denomination they follow the teaching fo the word of truth,they would call them selves a child of god. they also have a radio callin question monday tru friday just click their calander and listen,plenty of resource that is very good.hope this helps!

z74a7wvlaa	1] The ordinary rule on fasting days was to take but one meal a day and that only in the evening, while meat and wine were entirely forbidden. During Holy Week, or at least on Good Friday it was common to enjoin the xerophagi?, i.e., a diet of dry food, bread, salt, and vegetables. <br>  2] Current Church Law Regarding Fasting: <br>  The Church used to prescribe very rigorous rules for the Lenten fast (including abstaining from all meat and eating only one meal per day). The current rules, however, are much more lax. Catholics are only required to fast on Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent, and on Good Friday, the day that Jesus Christ was crucified. Anyone over the age of 18, but under the age of 60, should eat only one full meal on those days, although they can also have small amounts of food in the morning and the evening.

w8uUWK03aa	I suppose a few people would say "You can never have too much sex" which is OK for some, but there is usually a threshold everyone reaches, when enough is enough.  Sexual intercourse is a good cardiovascular work-out, but the friction on the penis and vagina or rectum takes its toll and can result in painful swelling. Additionally the testes can hurt like they've been hit with a baseball bat.  Unless you're an Olympic athlete you can end up aching and exhausted, with all your bits and pieces swollen and hurting... is it worth it?

There is no unifying document, no authority that tells us what to believe, nothing.<br>  <br>  Our numbers are hard to estimate.

We're not worried about being wrong; it's 1000 times more scary to be right because that means most of the world is a wee bit crazy. Oh sure, if you're Christian most of the world is still a wee bit crazy because there are still Shintoists and Muslims and all these other religions who are somehow deluded into not believing in your One True Imaginary Friend... but at least you have a substantial community of like-minded people around you. We stand isolated and alone.<br>  <br>  Most believers find our morals incomprehensible. I'll try to explain how we evaluate a problem.<br>  <br>  A speeding trolley is heading down a track towards a junction. To your left is a branch of track with one construction worker on it. A group of five construction workers lies dead ahead. You can continue straight or throw the switch and send the trolley to the left; none of the construction workers are likely to get out of the way in time. What do you do?<br>  <br>  Atheists will (almost) universally answer that the right thing to do is to switch it to the left. It is the logical thing to do; fewer people will die. Believers are more likely to balk at the decision to murder one. It feels wrong. Feelings do not change the mathematics of the number of bodies you will leave behind. We have empathy; all psychologically normal humans do. Our empathy is informed by our logic.<br>  <br>  Believers will say their morals are motivated by fear of hellfire and a desire for heaven. We suspect that they're closer to us than they realize and try to do good things because they seek social acceptance and happiness.<br>  <br>  There are two sides to every coin. I said that all normal humans have empathy but there are also abnormal humans. An ordinary sociopath who has nothing but his impulses to guide him is essentially an animal and only slightly more dangerous than a hungry tiger. A sociopath who is smart enough to allow logic to guide his or her impulses is much more likely to get what they want and much less likely to get caught.

But remember folks! Atheists are DANGEROUS and will not hesitate to harm you or your children! So play it safe and be sure to thoroughly read this article to prevent disaster. For the lazy or the infirm atheists can also be purchased from atheist farms, or from Ebay. For the really lazy, agnostics will do in a pinch, but they are decidedly bland.<br>  <br>  The first step of course is finding an atheist! While they are found quite commonly on the internet, probably mocking your religion on your message board no doubt, but alas, they are harder to find face to face. The best way to find an atheist is to go out when most normal people are at church in early morning Sundays. This will require you to miss church as well, but I'm sure God will understand you are doing this for the greater good and forgive you (God's cool like that). <br>  <br>  Of course atheists are often slobs and will choose to rather sleep in the safety of their homes during this time. But do not despair! There are still bound to be some atheists roaming the streets. Try going around to public places. It is safe to assume that everyone you meet is one of the following: <br>  <br>  Another person trying to catch an atheist - be sure to let them know that you are one of their number. Secret handshakes are a cool way for atheist hunters to recognize each other. Be sure to join forces with anyone you meet since there is safety in numbers! <br>  <br>  Adherents to some strange, exotic, or otherwise obscure religion - Be careful of these, for they are religious but just don't keep the Sabbath holy, or worse, think the Sabbath is on another day! Seriously, what kind of crazy people would go church on Saturdays?<br>  <br>  An atheist - Your target, your prey, the object of your mission. Stay calm. Try to look for subtle hints that they are an atheist. Are they in the library reading His Dark Materials or some other Satanic God-hating book? Are they in the Starbucks drinking some kind of weird tea rather than an espresso loaded with God's drug of choice? Those are the Atheists. <br>  <br>  Atheists have developed many arguments against religion that may be used to distract you so they can make a quick getaway. Don't let them get their point across! As soon as the atheist begins to talk about invisible pink things or teapots in space be sure to give them a good knock over the head to prevent their blasphemy! <br>  <br>  Ok, so now you have your atheist. So what is next? You must prevent the atheist from any means of escape. This means using duct tape and lots of it. Be sure to place it directly on the hairy parts of the arms and legs in order to ensure that your atheist cannot remove themselves using the powers that Satan gives them. An essential step is to be sure to gag the atheist since they have been known to talk their captors into suicide with their insane attempts at "logic". You may want to bring a backup person who is 100% resistant to atheism, preferably a redneck with a shotgun or an abortion clinic bomber. <br>  <br>  Atheists can fit into a variety of small spaces and can be easily transported in the trunks of most cars. Atheists are also very durable and can even survive being shipped through UPS with only minor damage. If you have collected atheists as specimens and want to keep them in top shape, be sure to put them in boxes before shipping and include large amounts of bubble wrap and packing peanuts.|`|jN5SXl5Caa	That is an impossibility for the most part.

98a1aa89f409b8433bf738429e4cb1fdaa	orientaltrading.com sells that kind of thing, and so does the Spirit Online store.  <br>  <br>  I did a Hogwarts party for my son a few years back.  We took the biggest books in the house and made new covers out of construction paper.  I wrote the names of every book I could find mentioned in the series, and wrote them on the construction paper.  <br>  <br>  For potions, clean out the fridge, and label the ketchup, mustard, chocolate sauce, etc with new funny names.  <br>  <br>  Get styrofoam balls, cover them in gold tissue or spray paint, put on little foil or felt wings, make golden snitches.  Hang them from the ceiling.  <br>  <br>  put every broom in the house in one corner; hang a sign there that says 'broom parking'  <br>  <br>  Put signs on the doors that say things like 'dungeon' and 'Prof so and so' <br>  <br>  You can find some stuff in a large party store, for Harry Potter theme parties.  The rest of it you can pretty much make from a pack of construction paper, scrap cardboard, and string.|`|OcDZkyG8aa	why not try a craft store or something where you can buy the materials to make it yourself or goto a party shop or fancy dress shop<br>  <br>  x|`|uxctidZkaa	i think they sell them at hogwarts

Thirdly, this question is offensive, even if you mean no harm, it is still not a good thing to say. And to all those other people who said "because they don't have a shower", you are stupid because, they DO. Okay?  P.S - I'm not Pakistani.  Have a nice day.|`|eoOmeeJoaa	Do you want the real answer to your question or just the garbage that the racists are spewing?  If you want the real answer, here goes.  The spices that are used in Pakistani/Indian cooking are much different than those used in North America.  The foods are processed by the body, and some of the odours are excreted through the skin/perspiration.  Just think of garlic, eat too much and you can smell it not only on a persons breath but on their body as well

NwbgvzfXaa	Your version is simple, yet clear. However, I would make the following improvements:  - replace "Coming back here" with "Returning".  - replace "while" with "absence".  - replace "see" with "notice".  - replace "big" with "significant".    With these changes, your sentence would read  "Returning after a long absence, I was surprised to notice significant changes."|`|63c29d0e010c46bcc8d52695123cb4beaa	Pretty good - just add something: Coming back here after a long while/time, I was surprised to see such big changes.|`|vKJ6OFxxaa	just take out "here" i think itll sound better

be78fb3ef714e3deabcf82d71938b4adaa	Adam4Adam.com    Be upfront with what you are looking for in your profile however.  Like gay.com it is mostly for hooking up for brief stints but if you state that you are looking for friendship you may make some friends.  I have met a few guys on it and we chat online, nothing sexual, but about life and stuff.|`|H2IqzG12aa	You can also use Yahoo! Answers e-mail service.  Just write to anyone you see here (who has enabled their Answers email).  Yahoo uses each person's email account to pass messages back and forth, but it only uses your Answers screen name, not your real email account address (what you see on your profile page is just for your benefit--that's not what others see--to see what they see, click on "Public View of My Profile"). The utility is pretty basic and messages you send can't be saved, but it is secure.  And if you and the other person click, you can then exchange your actual email addresses and go from there.|`|gmrH0sNBaa	http://www.match.com    It's the worlds biggest dating site   Sorry you have to pay though =[|`|f7l9byFGaa	http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=utf-8&...|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	Alright, I've tried a few dating sites, pay and free.. My favorite one so far is plentyoffish.com .... you can search for only guys that are looking for other guys.. then just read people's profiles and contact the ones you like.   Because it's free, there are LOTS of people on it, I live in a pretty small city and I've found tons of people near my. My roommate found her boyfriend like that, and my boss got married off the site.   It'll be hit and miss for awhile finding the people that are actually honest and real people, but it's a chance you take with most dating websites. Just block the creepy people..     Good luck, i'm 19 too and I've never had a bf and I feel like I'm getting ready to settle down...     But really... try plentyoffish.com... it's worked really well for almost everyone I know :)|`|ROVhLgH7aa	well i would suggest Adam4adam like everybody else did BUT it is sooooooooooo addictive, you would have to take time out once in a while and please dont be afraid to use the block buttone because some of those people on there are crazy and dangerous too.

3gZGYIQaaa	Get a special notebook that you keep in your car.  When they make a rude comment to you, glance at your watch afterward and make a mental note of the time.  When you get off your shift, go to your car and write down, to the best of your memory, exactly what was said (both ways) and the time of day and the date.  Keep a journal of all of this.    When you are ready to quit or are fired or whatever, you now have some good ammunition for a sexual harrassment lawsuit.  Even if you are male, you might have the right.  Why?  Your boss telling you to suck his whatever, is a homesexual taunt.  I wouldn't like it if a woman told me to do oral sexual favors in order to have time off - even if it was said as a joke.  That sort of language and behavior has no place in the workplace.    They might think it's funny.  But you will be the one laughing all the way to the bank when you quit your job and later sue them in court.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	Everyone sign a petition and send it to the home office, if there is one.

Good luck to you.|`|AA11298788	Most companies have a Human Resources department, or a higher-level manager you can speak to about this.

Be prepared, do not get emotional, and understand you have a right not to be treated this way.

If you are talking about the museum, Notre Dame is said Notre Dame also in spanish, and is pronounced in french.    The literal translation would be Nuestra Se?ora.    "Posiblemente, si hay tiempo, veremos el museo de Notre Dame" ---> that's the right way to say it. Notre Dame alone doesn't sound good. You need to call it "el museo de Notre Dame".|`|adef29031513d305e63fae0bd1584e09aa	Notre Dame is french and translates as Nuestra Se?ora.

AA12158476	For the moment love, cry! then take a deep breath and talk with him. If you need to express your feelings about who you are, now might be the time to do. He more than likely is not going to be happy, but your well being is a little more important. If he really loves you, and he does, he will need to understand that you are your own person and in order for you to be happy, you need to be truthful about who you are. He needs to take into consideration he raised you to be honest and accept his little girl is a girl who likes girls.

Don't let their overactive imagination come up with various reasons you were looking.      Also find a friend you can confide it and ask for a shoulder to cry on.  Without it you will feel alone.

AA10422553	There are 18 chapters in srimath Bhagavad Geetha--they are 18 Yogams--like Karma Yogam,Gjnaana yogam,Bhakthi Yogam,Ksrtram-Kshtragjna vipaaka yogam etc.<br>  <br>  the purport of entire Bhagavad Geetha is Jeevaathma(Arjuna)-Paramaathama(Lord sri.Krishna) Aikyam(Union>YUJ.>YOGAM) only.|`|UqgCazhGaa	Yoga means linking with the Supreme. Arjuna was told about the various Yoga systems but ultimately the practical situation was how to work for Lord Krishna - that is the best Yoga.<br>  <br>  Bg Introduction                  <br>     How is this possible? The acaryas give the following example. If a married woman is attached to another man, or if a man has an attachment for a woman other than his wife, then the attachment is to be considered very strong. One with such an attachment is always thinking of the loved one. The wife who is thinking of her lover is always thinking of meeting him, even while she is carrying out her household chores. In fact, she carries out her household work even more carefully so her husband will not suspect her attachment. Similarly, we should always remember the supreme lover, Sri Krsna, and at the same time perform our material duties very nicely. A strong sense of love is required here. If we have a strong sense of love for the Supreme Lord, then we can discharge our duty and at the same time remember Him. But we have to develop that sense of love. Arjuna, for instance, was always thinking of Krsna; he was the constant companion of Krsna, and at the same time he was a warrior. Krsna did not advise him to give up fighting and go to the forest to meditate. When Lord Krsna delineates the yoga system to Arjuna, Arjuna says that the practice of this system is not possible for him.<br>                 <br>    arjuna uvaca<br>    yo 'yam yogas tvaya proktah samyena madhusudana<br>    etasyaham na pasyami cancalatvat sthitim sthiram<br>  <br>                 <br>     "Arjuna said, O Madhusudana, the system of yoga which You have summarized appears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is restless and unsteady." (Bg. 6.33)<br>  Bg Introduction                  <br>     But the Lord says:<br>                  <br>    yoginam api sarvesam mad-gatenantaratmana<br>    sraddhavan bhajate yo mam sa me yuktatamo matah<br>  <br>                  <br>     "Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga, and is the highest of all." (Bg. 6.47) So one who thinks of the Supreme Lord always is the greatest yogi, the supermost jnani, and the greatest devotee at the same time. The Lord further tells Arjuna that as a ksatriya he cannot give up his fighting, but if Arjuna fights remembering Krsna, then he will be able to remember Him at the time of death. But one must be completely surrendered in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.                <br>     We work not with our body, actually, but with our mind and intelligence. So if the intelligence and the mind are always engaged in the thought of the Supreme Lord, then naturally the senses are also engaged in His service. Superficially, at least, the activities of the senses remain the same, but the consciousness is changed. The Bhagavad-gita teaches one how to absorb the mind and intelligence in the thought of the Lord. Such absorption will enable one to transfer himself to the kingdom of the Lord. If the mind is engaged in Krsna's service, then the senses are automatically engaged in His service. This is the art, and this is also the secret of Bhagavad-gita: total absorption in the thought of Sri Krsna.

8DCslWmMaa	Jesus was not born in December. It is clear in the Bible that winter is not the season at his time of birth.  That is if one believes that Jesus was a real man born of a real woman.  There is an astrological explination that fully describes the 'birth of the son of god'. But many do not want to believe this.     If it is the Christmas Holiday you are speaking of, the Church was the one that turned the birth of Christ into a December holiday.  The purpose behind this is that there where already several celebrations and traditions of the 'old ways' already ingrained into the culture and social order.  Saturnalia, a 7 day festival, Yule or Solstice, and several others.  Many of the Christmas traditions are completly pagan in origin, such as the tree and the star upon the tree. Many think the star represents the Star of Bethlehem (can be astrologically explained as well), when actually the star (on the tree) is the North Star.  The holly and mistletoe are all from the Druid traditions.

Most people here work for alot more than that but seen there is alot of jobs been made redundant and places closing down due to the economic problems these days, I think it will stay like that.

The action started at 9 a.m. and run till 5 p.m.  In the action participated the just 7 older members from Zdravec 2002 because of the inaccessibility of the lakeshores. Either the police, local communal inspector, keeper of the dam and employees in the hydroelectric power plant were previously informed.   A considerable amount of plastic bottles was taken out from the water surface and being collected in nylon bags on the land. The members of the Society had been heavily working at heat and after 8 hours all the particular bottles from the locality Prepish were swept off.

The first Klan was founded in 1865 by veterans of the Confederate Army. Its purpose was to restore white supremacy in the aftermath of the American Civil War. The Klan resisted Reconstruction by intimidating freedmen and white Republicans, who at the time had a predominantly liberal base. The KKK quickly adopted violent methods. The increase in murders finally resulted in a backlash among Southern elites who viewed the Klan's excesses as an excuse for federal troops to continue occupation. The organization declined from 1868 to 1870 and was destroyed by President Grant's passage and enforcement of the Force Acts of 1870 and 1871.    In 1915, the second Klan was founded. It grew rapidly in a period of postwar social tensions. After World War I, many Americans coped with booming growth rates in major cities, where numerous waves of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe and the Great Migration of Southern blacks and whites were being absorbed. After World War I, labor tensions rose as veterans tried to reenter the work force. In reaction to these new groups of immigrants and migrants, the second KKK preached racism, anti-Catholicism, anti-Communism, nativism, and anti-Semitism. Some local groups took part in lynchings, attacks on private houses and public property, and other violent activities. Members used ceremonial cross burning to intimidate victims and demonstrate its power. Murders and violence by the Klan were most numerous in the South, which had a tradition of lawlessness.[3]    The film The Birth of a Nation and the sensationalized newspaper coverage of the trial, conviction and lynching of Leo Frank of Georgia sparked the Klan's revival. The second Klan was a formal fraternal organization, with a national and state structure. At its peak in the mid-1920s, the organization included about 15% of the nation's eligible population, approximately 45 million men.[4] The Klan's popularity fell further during the Great Depression and World War II.[5]    The name Ku Klux Klan has since been used by many independent groups opposing the Civil Rights Movement and desegregation, especially in the 1950s and 1960s. During this period, they often acted with impunity by forging alliances with Southern police departments, as during the reign of Bull Connor in Birmingham, Alabama; or with governor's offices, as with George Wallace of Alabama.[6] Several members of KKK-affiliated groups were convicted of manslaughter and murder in the deaths of civil rights workers and children in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Alabama, the assassination of NAACP organizer Medgar Evers, and the murders of three civil rights workers in Mississippi. Today, researchers estimate there may be more than 150 Klan chapters with 5,000-8,000 members nationwide. The U.S. government classifies them as hate groups, with operations in separated small local units.

Sharkey reported that disorder, lack of control and lawlessness were widespread; in some states armed bands of Confederate soldiers roamed at will. Southerners seemed to take out on blacks all their wrath at the Federal government. They casually attacked and killed blacks whose bodies were left on the roads.[10][dubious  discuss]       A political cartoon depicting the KKK and the Democratic Party as continuations of the ConfederacyIn an 1867 meeting in Nashville, Tennessee, Klan|`|jAc7AgOiaa	No, they adopted that outfit from someone else.|`|jOTTIDNQaa	Its supposed to create fear but it just makes them look stupid!|`|cLVZT3ASaa	I think it's more of a coward kinda thing.

Sex drive is an individual thing at its core, but when we talk about it in terms of gender generalizations, it has to do with hormones.  And all men have the same levels of testosterone, be they gay or straight.    That said, gay men do have more opportunities to engage in casual sex, which may lead to an increased focus on sex, and therefore more desire.    But innately, no.  No difference in sex drives.

Were I only to choose tall men, I would have way fewer men to choose from.  My husband is 7 inches shorter than me.  I would have missed out on the love of my life if I thought he was too short for me.  Our height difference makes no difference in our love for each other.  The only difference is when I put things on high shelves and forget he can't reach them.|`|UibsALccaa	Honest, since i'm not that tall I would prefer to marry someone taller that me because I want to feel secure and protected. But if they were short and they have a fabulous personally, then I would marry them.|`|JiaGiVexaa	That makes you a heightist, no, no too wrong to discriminate.|`|g2CZi00Uaa	brothers and GIRLS hahaha xD  are we not your sisters?|`|hWo22bJ0aa	lol, interesting question.

Spare me the horror please!|`|sDdp3RBpaa	I'm  5'3 at the moment    well he guy has to be taller then me at least a lil bit taller.|`|bs9Zbouaaa	i agree with DAWN.|`|5iXcXlMeaa	I am tall ( not very tall but I am still a teen so I will grow taller) so he has to be at least taller than me but the taller he is the better.

"All of them will be from Quraish."[1]    "The matter (life) will not end, until it is passed by twelve Caliphs" ... "All of them will be from Quraish."

[4]    "The Islamic religion will continue until the Hour (day of resurrection), having twelve Caliphs for you, all of them will be from Quraish." [5]    "There shall be twelve Caliphs for this community, all of them from Quraish." [6]    "Twelve Caliphs, (like) the number of the Chiefs of Bani Israel." [7]    "There will be after me twelve Amir (Prince/Ruler), all of them from Quraysh." [8]    "This religion remains standing until there are twelve vicegerents over you, all of them agreeable to the nation, all of them from Quraysh." [9]    "Islam will continue to be triumphant until there have been twelve Caliphs" ... "All of them are from Quraysh." [10]    "This nation will always remain straight in its affairs, and triumphant against the enemies, till twelve Caliphs will be among them; all of them from Quraysh. Then there will be discord and confusion." [11]    "There will be twelve upright Imams for this nation. Those who try to disgrace them will not succeed; all of them shall be from the Quraysh." [12]    "The affair of the people will continue as long as twelve men rule over them." [12]    "This religion will remain till twelve Imams from Quraysh (will pass), then when they expire the earth will swallow its inhabitants."[12]    "The affair of this nation will always be apparent till the twelve Imams will rise, all of them from the Quraysh."

I've always been a good dancer, and that night I really got into it, and literally surprised the entire class.

(I was employed as a corporate controller at that time & most people think that accountants are super dull)    Also, once (in my 20's), I was out at NY nightclub with some friends, and someone dared me to dance on the bar, and I did.

I got to know the divers there and they invited me to go with them, since I was certified), made the Dean's List in college (even my mother didn't believe that and I had to take the letter and my transcripts home to show her.  I was older and more focused by then and had been out of high school over 20 years.)   They were also surprised when I finally showed up for our 30th year class reunion.  Many thought I was dead (I missed my 5th..I was in Japan; my 10th...in Sardinia; my 20th...in Israel). Seems a guy in the next town with the same name (only 12 years older) died and most thought it was me.  Especially since I never made any of the reunions, and when I went 'up home' I saw few of the people I went to school with.  Just visited a couple of people, and my family.
t81MEJ82aa	Being an Ameican man myself, I can understand what you are saying. I find many American women to not be feminine and most have misplaced values, though I wouldn't go as far as saying I'm not attracted to them. These differences are cultural. But what you find "masculine" most American women would probably consider absusive.|`|4yg7zZZ2aa	I don't know many Americans. Be they from South or North America. I just mostly know people from Europe (I live in Russia), Asia and Africa.    But I am highly sceptical that just because a male is born in the USA they are all "boring and unmasculine". I think that is a inductive fallacy.    And no, I haven't noticed that.    I don't think any country can have  "all man are like this" or "all women are like that".  People are individualistic.|`|xKjecOTYaa	If you had a masculine man, you would call him abusive, so quit your whining. On average, I would say that American men are probably the most aggressive men in the world. There are ALL different types of people ALL over the world, so quit making generalizations.|`|NBXY35zPaa	Out of the entire U.S. men population, you've probably only met 3% of them, so to generalize that all of us are "not masculine" and boring is ridiculous... and the answerer above me is right, if we were all testosterone-filled, arrogant, rugged, and adventurous we'd all be the exact same stereotyped Americans every loves to think we are. Not all women prefer this type. I'm an American raised Asian-French guy who was a state wrestler, judo competitor, all around athlete but I'm also compassionate and I like to help others. And if that makes me a "timid and boring American" then get out of our states and find your men elsewhere.|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	You apparently have not found any Marines yet.|`|R3TzcZu8aa	I am going to agree with the statement two above me.  I am married to a United States Marine and he is far from timid, unmasculine, and boring.  Maybe you are looking for men in the wrong places.  Or perhaps you are the kind of girl real men do not date?|`|DvZdB66maa	Unmasculine in what way?? As in, not abusive and degrading? If that's what you mean, then yeah, I agree. But I would rather have a man who can listen, is compassionate and sensitive, and who knows how to compromise... rather than someone "masculine" who just abuses me and sees me as 2nd place to him. I know that a lot of men in other countries expect women to bow down to them and take 2nd place to them... Trust me, I know from firsthand experience. But if that's what you like, then more power to you!|`|aX73hS2Daa	I think it's pretty weird to generalize about every man in America... it's a big country!  Surely you haven't met every single guy, and I bet there are plenty that would be masculine enough for you.    But I think you're confusing cultural machismo with masculinity.  Mexico, Colombia, and Lebanon aren't exactly known for their great treatment of women.  They tend to do the whole treat you like a princess when you're dating, and then treat you like a slave once you're married, and it's based on their cultural expectations and generally being less advanced feminism-wise.  I'd be careful... my parents lived in Colombia for a while, and they heard stories of American girls being entranced by the Colombian guys courting them, and then as soon as they got married the guys started treating them like ****. (Yes I'm generalizing, but I do have some direct knowledge to back it up.)    Don't confuse aggression or male entitlement for masculinity or what I suspect you're really talking about, dominance.  People think you have to be an asshole and aggressive to be dominant, but it's just not true... watch Cesar Millan (The Dog Whisperer) and you'll see what caring and non-aggressive dominance can look like.  :)    I'd choose being treated like a decent respectable human being over masculinity any day.|`|IJgif2Czaa	dunno, but i found american women to be horrible and rude.  they tend to think they're better than everyone else...whether they're Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, Asian, Arab etc.|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Ah, the romance of a foreign affair. The stuff that has sold millions of romance novels and packed movie theatres. So vivid, so thrilling, so passionate....     so...temporary and at times so limiting! Oh wait, that's not part of the script?  But often times it's very much a part of the reality of a cross-cultural relationship.    Truth is, you really can't judge anyone's personality based on someone's nationality. It's too easy to allow the novelty of "difference" to define whether someone is truly interesting or not.     Don't let a foreign accent convince you the person is so fascinating and challenging when in reality they may actually be boring or even closer to boorish than truly masculine.  Besides, once you get to know a person sometimes the things you found so fascinating and 'exotic' about them may become the very things you wind up despising about them.  Happens all the time.    Trust me, there are plenty of American men who are masculine and very interesting.  They're out there if you take off the blinders and look.  Go ahead and date foreign men, but give the Americans a chance to. You may find yourself very pleasantly surprised.|`|IUlIixJLaa	Alot of american men weren't originally americans so if I were you I might want to look a little harder. Everyone has their own tastes in men..good luck

It takes courage to speak out when you've got things to lose, and if everyone had that courage, then courage wouldn't be a very special thing.    Anyway, as the above users said, numbers matter not.|`|Kiv4D2aWaa	Hey, even the Quran says majorities aren't always right.    "If you obeyed most of those on earth they would mislead thee far from Allah's way. They follow naught but an opinion, and they do but guess." (6:116)     The non-religious answer would be that obviously the majority picked the (Sunni) khalif. A minority remained loyal to Ali (If it were the other way round, Ali would have been the first khalif) So no. Sunnism didn't gravitate more followers. They were just more of them from the beginning.    Edit:    Excuse me. I thought you said "This is a serious question, and I believe I asked it with respect"    Your edits don't sound very respectful. They mostly sound like hateful anti-Islam  rhetoric only this time directed at Shias.    Shias books say Sunnis are 'kaffir' or that they believe 'Allah' lies or mistakes is similar to the anti-Islam claim that Muslims believe non-Muslims are to be killed and other slanders with which you are familiar.    "One last question...would you let your sister/mother have a Mut'aa marriage?"    Would you allow your 9 year old sister to marry a 53 year old man who has 9 other wives?   Would you marry a married man after having just gotten divorced from his son?    I don't mean to offend the rest of Muslims. I'm just fighting fire with fire. I often defend Muslims against hateful and unfair anti-Muslim rhetoric. But I find it hypocritical that Muslims demand the respect of non-Muslims but can't respect other religious minorities. Disheartening and disgusting. But then, from what I gather, you're not the most mature user. Another drama mama.|`|QHo7Cw7uaa	shias has many tongues ,they can always say that majority is not the criteria for right or wrong ,    but at the sanme time boasting about the great no of their own sect|`|TbPcMYkfaa	in my eyes there is no separation, we are muslims!

87e7b956696278de07838481b900732caa	No matter where you go, there will always be people who will try to make your life miserable; whether out of jealousy, envy, insecurity or just plain meanness. Some day you're going to have to learn how to deal with those kinds of people. (It's so true that the more you pay attention to them, the more they will harass you; if you ignore them, sooner or later they get tired of no reaction from you and move on to bother someone else.)  If you don't learn how to handle those kind of people, you'll be miserable no matter where you go. As the saying goes, "No matter where YOU go, there YOU'LL always be."   You're giving that girl a lot of power by showing her that she can chase you out of town. What you really need to do is gather a support system around you -people who can help you and encourage you- so you won't feel so alone in this. Then IGNORE her. Don't give her the satisfaction of knowing that she can push your buttons.  I don't know how old you are, but I suppose if you're of legal age, no one can stop you from going anywhere you want.    Here's a cool website that can give you some tools in learning how to stand up for yourself:    http://www.purpleslinky.com/Humor/Life/W...    If you can learn to stop people in their tracks the first few times they try to bother you, they'll quickly leave you alone. Good luck.

While using corn is inefficient, wasteful, and bad for the environment, it is one of those feel-good things that tree-huggers have grasped onto and won't let go.  Obama relies on a lot of votes from this group of well-meaning, but ill-informed "environmentalists."  These are the same kind of people who still support the ban on DDT, which has resulted in millions of malaria deaths in Africa and South America.   Unfortunately, many electricity generators are beginning to sign on to a similar bandwagon.

Sleep well angel.  You are not going Partying tonight? and the beautiful alcohol?  Funny! I hope you are well! Enjoy your Sunday and today f.y.i ...........  I am with you.|`|4Ud7ao9Iaa	I want to ride with you. Know what, I cherish your beautiful and wonderful love. Sleep well, Angel.    What are you doing tonight? There too, no alcohol? Funny! I hope you eat well. I'm doing something on Sunday, and further more I am hopeful about something. I am with you something.    the somethings I couldn't quite figure out. I'm fluent in German, and a native speaker of Afrikaans, which is South African version of Dutch. Since Dutch is also, in a sense, a far off dialect of German, it sometimes helps to figure out the other dialects.    As you can see I can only partially understand Swiss German, but hope it helps in the meanwhile!
VutEXvCIaa	I volunteer at the child development center in a hospital. my reward is seeing the kids all happy and i just love helping them out. i don't believe it's important to be a servant.
17orTrcRaa	I think that a guy might feel bad if he hadn't given flowers to someone that he feels like he should have.  But if he is a fun-loving guy, he would like the flowers.  Not a big, fussy bouquet, but just a couple of simple manly flowers.  I think most florists have a selection of masculine things they can add to an arrangement.|`|5b65f879f0c7128f9d7069f75d66aedcaa	i would think the guy receiving them was gay|`|U60L7qNEaa	hahahah i loved this question cuz it happened to me last year  i was 16 then [17 now] and my gf had been going out for like 6 months before valentines day    and i guess she procrastinated on getting me a gift becuz all she got me was flowers and chocolate from walgreens while i made her two cd's with all her favorite songs on them    and while i appreciated her gifts and smiled back at her i was secretly thinking [i guess you didnt put much thought into this gift]    point of my story is...flowers are nice but be creative and give your bf a gift that he wouldnt expect but will love

lKE1ObbXaa	It can't. Saying children married to much older men, probably having to bear children and do sexual things with that man, is not religious. God or Gods, whichever your religion, would never ever want a child acting like an adult. They aren't even fully developed, psychically or mentally. Thats just my opinion but I hope I helped you.  Good Luck~()~|`|CDft5bscaa	You'll see in here that when in comes to religion they just accept things (child marriage, homophobia, ect.) outright, then construct a justification later|`|NVUngN45aa	why is underage sex in the gay category??????    that is almost worth reporting|`|FR5ttYfFaa	It cannot. There is a separation of church and state. A religion may say that an adult can marry a child, but the law says, "not in this country".    Now under a separation like that, same sex couples should not be prohibited from marrying based on religious beliefs either, but us "icky homos and lesbos" are the exception to that rule (somehow).|`|vLrG6jmdaa	How can that be justified? How can anyone justify something like that? Thats as ****** up as the people doing that kinda thing. Can anyone stop the madness, but then again that has been going on for thousands of years. Only in the past 100 years have we realized that it is sick and disgusting. So go figure.
x1LmS9vTaa	5. an elision  An elision is when, in the same line, the last letter of one word is either a vowel or an -m-, and the first letter of the next is a vowel or an -h-.  It's important to know because you "lose" a syllable.  So that would be:    "...urbem et" in line 1.  Instead of "ur-bem et" it's said "ur-be'et":  What you think would be two short syllables becomes one long one.  You'll have to ask your teacher about -m- before a vowel; it has a nasal sound that I can't describe.    6. a liquid  Liquids are -l- and -r- when they come immediately after a "stop" consonant (p, b, c, etc.).  Those are important because, even though there are two consonants in one syllable, it *may* be counted as short.  [EDIT:  If you saw it earlier, ignore what I wrote about "lacrimis"!]    7. a spondaic line (where the 5th foot is a spondee and not a dactyl)  I'm sorry, but I'm not sure.  Let's see . . .    dactyl = long-short-short  spondee = long-long  It's definitely not 1 or 3, and the syllable -ti- in "volventibus" has to be short.  But then so is the -j- in "Julo."  I was told (and it's in Pharr) that the first letter in "julus" (unlike "julius" and "Juno") is a short -i-:  i-OO-luss.  But then, your text has "Julo" and not "Iulo" which must mean that it's a consonant.  Maybe someone else can help you with this.    8. a place where the knowledge of h is used  "certe hinc"  See what I wrote about elision above.  Here, the -h- of "hinc" is smooshed together with the -te of "certe".  So "-te hinc" becomes one long syllable.    9. the   of diphthongs in the lines above  You know this :-)  Diphthongs are ae, au, ei, eu, oe, and ui.  They make a syllable long by nature.    Sorry I couldn't help you with   7.
5ywrFCoUaa	I suspect it is for the same reasons that people make fun of Australians about Vegemite, or British for Mushy Peas, or Americans for Fried Chicken.

dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	I would say a simple gold Heart or double heart necklace with diamonds   other necklace ideas: tear drop,  cross or circle pendant  a tennis bracelet      she's one lucky lady!!!|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	I just turned 35 and my husband bought me a necklace for my birthday, I acted like I liked it but I was dissapointed.      The reason being...it was a super thin chain and it was a butterfly in a circle. I dk but that strikes me as little girl jewerly, not 'this is my wife and she's hot jewerly'.      its amazing what you can buy for 100, it doesn't even have to be gold. go shopping, we LOVE our earrings.  with 100 you can get her a cute top, earrings & a necklace to match.  then throw in a 40 gift card to the spa.  she will have a lot of present to open, which is so fun (scatter them throughout her house & let her 'find' them) and then she also has a gift she can look forward to.|`|oojO4WAraa	JC Penny's has some nice, affordable valentines jewelry.

That's what my wife got me for our first valentines day. Get a heart shaped gold charm or something sweet. The chain will run you 70-90 dollars and the charm will be about 30. A little over budget but well worth it. To be really sweet, buy a teddy bear or her favorite stuffed animal and put the chain around its neck with a card and flowers but it. She will love you forever!|`|hdrIaMF3aa	a heart shaped necklace that says " I love you"  or could just be plain|`|NYXHj02haa	Get her a nice little gold necklace with a small pendant on it.

LhCGU3F1aa	Where is your dad from? I know a lot of Italians that look like way that you described your self. Maybe you guys have some Southern European ancestory, take a DNA test, if you want to know if you have Middle Eastern ancestory, cause we can't really tell just by judging your looks.|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	Jewish.

iuyYfQHmaa	Don't worry about what your friend thinks. If you are ok with what you have done, or are doing, then do it. If not, then I suggest you look for other work.  Don't feel "less then", because of whatever line of work you have chosen, or what your "friends" think of it. You are still you, and if your friend cannot accept your choices, then he needs to grow up.  Peace!|`|0xz8mR2xaa	I don't think you did anything wrong, nor have you degraded yourself, but I think you should ponder whether you have some sexual fluidity, as most guys who do video shoots are at least bisexual. Also, you should question how good a friend this person really is. If he can't accept you as a sex worker or a bisexual person, will he really be there for other things he finds emotionally challenging?      It might come down to sex work or your friend, and since he seems like a real macho jerk, I don't think that's a hard pick given we're in a recession and porn puts food on your table.|`|gpQm5ZPpaa	Yeah, he thinks better of you.  He views you as a virtuous person, and for you to put yourself in that situation makes him feel different about you.  You need to decide.  Your money, or your friend?  What makes you happier?|`|jQ0kSIXIaa	I remember reading your other question a few weeks ago. How did it go?    Anyway just give him time and see if he comes around. If not then it's time for you to figure out what's more important.|`|W545hqrpaa	Why dont u just come out of the closet. They willl be more accepting of u being gay rahter than u saying this is your only way out of a financial bind. And if u r not gay, why is your avatar a rainbow. No need to answer any of my hypothetical questions.
17orTrcRaa	Candy, a card with a nice note you have written, stuffed animal, music cd you have burned with songs you two like, a movie (dvd) you can watch together, cook him dinner, bake him a cake or brownies - or something else that he would love, get  him a shirt to wear that he can think of you when he's wearing it, a framed photo of you or of the two of you, a tie if he has to dress up for work, just any little thoughtful thing you can think of that he's been wanting along with a card from you would be wonderful!|`|cesTfRKPaa	A mix cd.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	Candy|`|NqNTe5j0aa	Mens GHDs!  If he hasnt got short hair|`|YhYapmbIaa	Maybe  a nice, romantic date, a movie, dinner... I don't know, something nice like a walk on the beach?!   Love   Pearl|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	thats pretty easy, you...in lingere! isn't that what men are thinking of all the time anyway...food or sex. lol|`|DKufXulOaa	depends on how close you guys are! You could mix it up with a little buy and a litttle make. I used this idea last year...So here it is;    GET SOME SORT OF BASKET/A BUNCH OF BOXES (so he has to open up every single one)    USE THE FIVE SENSE:  HEAR: Burn a CD with you guys song (im assuming you have one)  SEE: Frame a picture of the two of you, an engraved watch  TOUCH: Maybe a teddy bear he won you at a carnival OR something that you can touch that represents your love (a heart pillow)  SMELL: maybe your perfume...or his  TASTE: candy/chocolate, yumm. or if your a cooker, you could cook him dinner    When you've thought of all you want to do you can either put it in a decorative basket OR put ever single "sense" in a different box, according to the size of your gifts    I know that this seems sooo cheesy, but when i gave this gift to my boyfrien, he was nearly in tears at how creative and thoughtful it was! :)    GOOD LUCK picking a gift!
HFqiY6BGaa	barnes and noble is better|`|cjnBs0h6aa	you know him better than any one on here...you should pick. also you dont know him well enough to get something other than a gift card..there nice from relatives but not a relationship.|`|4fUOfscbaa	i think you should get him a gas card & maybe something like a itunes gift card( if he has a ipod).  go out to eat & spend time w/h each other.|`|5TazpUZKaa	i know how u feel that was me 2 years ago only this time its 20th bdya valentines and 27months lol just merge them all into 1|`|v8pwzb52aa	well i would probably get him a gift card from borders, and since its v day too get index cards and decorate them and on each card write a reason why you love him, and maybe print out love and romantic coupon things, and put them all in a little cute decorated index card box or something. i dont know im a hopeless romantic and my bf likes stuff like that. sorry i couldnt explain it better.|`|AA11324576	Don't spend too much, relationships rarely last at your age
DcUoZntOaa	I think the day is coming soon when we all will be looked at equally!  peace!|`|LhCGU3F1aa	I feel sorry for everyone. The past is the past. So you feel sorry for the Jewish right? Do you not feel sorry for those innocent Muslim children and women that the Jewish are killing right now? I feel sorry for everyone, all those people that died due to wars, and colonization.     This world needs to grow the hell up, I'm tired of these wars, what do you seriously get out of killing innocent people? Nothing. You don't get looked upon, instead your looked down upon, since your a murderer.    EDIT: Yeah, well it depends on where you live, if you live in an area with black people, white people, asians, or whatever, there bound to bring something up of the past, no? I live in a area where the black population is probably the secound highest, and the 'slave' topic only comes up when we talk about history and stuff. Sorry if I offended you or something. Alot of people are aware of the Jews, and how it was like a genocide. Yeah we should feel sorry for everyone, but seriously we should just look onto the future, to make it a better place. :)|`|xPWs1FAlaa	It's not the whole world, you have not explored the whole world so you can't really say that. The biggest culprit for all of this is culture and human nature and mentality. Prejudiced means a lot more then just saying something against a certain "religion", "race" and what not. You've been prejudiced before too, everybody has. You have to look at all you options, facts, opinions first before you focus on one thing. It's all in your head that nobody feels sorry for a "certain group" as to say it. Everyone is prejudged and everybody has prejudged, it doesn't matter who you are. It just so happens people just label and generalize everything because of the way of life. If you go in other parts of the world, I bet you "jews" are living in harmony and peace with others. It just depends on the culture, region, lifestyle and most importantly, you. You can't do anything about it, just live with it, because I can assure you that a "jew" has prejudged someone just as bad as anybody else. Human nature doesn't choose its victim depending on something that is man made and is an illusion.|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	I don't feel sorry for black people.  Most of the world does not feel sorry for them either.  People make their own misery and failures.  Especially in this society, they need to stop making excuses and blaming everyone else for their problems.|`|0hsh000waa	I don't feel sorry for any whole group of people but individuals who have struggles.    Edit: You can't compare blacks to Jewish people because Jews sometimes can blend in with other whites, black people stand out.|`|X5hTmAkBaa	are you kidding me?|`|LUWQ5S5jaa	Shut UP already!    Self-Pity or Pity in general is not good!  Why can't people get over the past and stop constantly thinking people own them something!|`|AA11323431	if you think blacks and jews are prejudiced against try being roman catholic
eGtZXgRHaa	Tell him if they don't hit on you then you'll hit on them :D lolll|`|el9wtu9Uaa	Just be like "Dad, not everybody is closed minded and I actually don't mind lesbians. They are normal people too. I can defend myself if I need too.|`|xlhu4I3caa	I would just tell them to f*** off and stop being bigots. But that probably won't work for you.

Either keep it to yourself, or be prepared to deal with their reaction!|`|DZB0WCmmaa	strange but at the age of 17 I also considered myself BI, wow. But nothing turned me in a lesbian. Tell him that you can contol your life and at least if a girl hits on you, he won't become grandfather at an early age|`|K6cHlzAkaa	tell them you are already Bi, that nothing has or will influence you; you just are. tell them if someone hits on you ; you are big enough to say No(or Yes).
WPDEru4Baa	agree with Rachel|`|QYy0vU4maa	I agree with Rachel that is a very good idea!|`|r9s0VyJgaa	Next time your dad tries to give you advice about how to deal with girls hitting on you at college, just tell him "Well, actually, Dad, if a girl I liked tried to hit on me, I'd wouldn't mind."      He'll ask you "Why? What do you mean?"  and at that point you tell him "I'm bisexual.  I like girls as well as guys, so I would date a girl, if I liked her."     Now you're out :-)|`|qbb9YiRsaa	In part it is necessary.  If you respect and love your parents, they deserve to know the real you.  Now, if they are paying for said college, it may be a problem as if they are really against it they may pull their funding...especially if they feel it will make your "gayness worse" by being at an all girls school.  Maybe if you can find out from them what they think about bisexual people or gay people.

I don't think your parents need to know you are bisexual unless you actually feel like it's something the need to know about you, like for example if you are actually in a relationship with another woman.     Similar to what Rachel said though, maybe just next time he tells you about getting hit on by a woman, just ask him why that would be a bad thing? Or would it change the way he felt about you if you were into it.    If they blame the school for turning you into a lesbian then that would sadly be them being irrational about it in general, nothing can "turn" someone into gay or bi, it's just a natural state of who someone is.|`|q1rPAlBLaa	That is up to you. coming out to peoople is a personal  decision.  Tell your dad that u can handle yourself. telling him that u wudnt mind is a completely different thing though. if u dont want to come out to ur dad there is one way to react and if u do theres another.... and if ur not ready to come out yet, but think u may later, and at that time if he does try to blame the school, u can show him the site pflag.com    u can not turn someone into a lesbian. it doesnt work.  if u have any questions, u can email me at south_of_spashley@yahoo.com     im bisexual as well, and im 16 years old and considering a girls college as well.     but to answer ur question its not neccessary. its up to you. there are no requirements...|`|0xz8mR2xaa	I know some people who are closeted to their family, yet are screamingly out to their friends. Campus is a whole 'nother world, and one can crossdress, openly have a same-gender partner or partners, mostly associate with queer people, .etc without parents knowing. That said, if you can tell your parents and still go to Smith or Vassar, do so. I can't gauge the situation, but they might just be casually homophobic people, and they'll likely accept you as their daughter even if they don't understand your desires. Perhaps you could ask mum/dad why it would be so awful if a girl were to hit on you, and casually ask him what he would think if he knew you took a woman up on such a proposition.

I hate competition, it takes all the fun out of things.  I play games to have fun, I don't care if I win or lose and I never keep score.  I attempt new things just to see if I can do it, not to see if I'm better than someone else.  I do my job to the best of my ability for *my* satisfaction, not to prove I'm better than someone else.    I think competitive people have no self-confidence and need those "wins" to feel good about themselves.

XD|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Foreplay is sexual stimulation meant to arouse an individual, usually a precursor to some sort of penetrative sexual intercourse (but not always).    It can include kissing, touching, rubbing, and other sorts of touch, as well as "mood enhancers" like lighting candles, turning on sexy music, using erotica/pornography, etc..    For a long time, it has been assumed that women require great amounts of foreplay in order to enjoy sex (some sex manuals suggest two hours or more of foreplay before sex!), but a recent scientific study found that foreplay adds little to a woman's overall enjoyment of sex:    http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/articl...

DO7lDtqxaa	Islam is the same religion that God revealed through His messengers (peace be upon them) to all people. Islam is a complete way of life. It impacts every part of life, from eating and sleeping to working and playing. It is not only a personal religion, but also a social one.     Muslims are supposed to live in accordance with God's laws. By doing so, they strive to obtain nearness to God and victory over temporary trials and temptations in this world. All aspects of their practice including prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage are intended to help meet this goal.     Muslims believe in Allah, the Supreme and Eternal, Infinite and Mighty, Merciful and Compassionate, The Creator and The Provider, He begets not, nor was He begotten, and there is none equal or comparable unto Him.     Muslims believe in all Messengers of Allah without any discrimination among them, as every known nation has a Warner or messenger from Allah. They were chosen by God to teach humanity and deliver His Divine message. The Qur'an mentions the name of some of them including Jews including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Moses, Aaron, David, Solomon, Elias, Jonah, John the Baptist, and Jesus (peace be upon them).     Muslims also believe in another prophet named Muhammad, who is a direct descendant of Abraham through his first born son, Ishmael. His prophethood is prophecied in the Bible in several places, including Deut 18:18 and John 14:16. Mohammad  stands as the last messenger and the crowning glory of the foundation of prophethood.     There are five basic principles/pillars of Islam    1) Faith - There is no god worthy of worship except God and Muhammad is His messenger.  2) Prayer - Salat is the name for the obligatory prayers which are performed five times a day, and are a direct link between the worshipper and God.   3) The 'Zakat' -.One of the most important principles of Islam is that all things belong to God, and that wealth is therefore held by human beings in trust. The word zakat means both 'purification' and 'growth'. Our possessions are purified by setting aside a proportion for those in need, and, like the pruning of plants, this cutting back balances and encourages new growth.  4) The Fast- Every year in the month of Ramadan, all Muslims fast from first light until sundown, abstaining from food, drink, and sexual relations.   5) Pilgrimage (Hajj)- The annual pilgrimage to Makkah - the Hajj - is an obligation only for those who are physically and financially able to perform it  .   http://www.islamicity.com/education/unde...    http://www.submission.org/    http://islamicweb.com/    http://islamicweb.com/?folder=beliefs    http://quranexplorer.com/quran/    http://www.islamtomorrow.com/    http://discover.islamway.com/    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Pillar...    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_(Conc...    http://www.shareislam.com/      Salaam- Peace|`|4GhGPecEaa	The entire base of Islam has to do with the idea of God's oneness.|`|QVSdGR55aa	Islam is based on peace & truth.

Shahadah (Testimony of faith)  ?? Pray 5 times a day  ?? Pay charity  ?? Fast during Ramadan  ?? Pilgrimage to Hajj.        We believe in Heaven & Hell.    To get to Heaven, one must:  ?? Believe in Allah  ?? Believe in the Prophets  ?? Believe in the Qur'an  ?? Believe in the Day of Judgment  ?? Do good deeds  ?? Pray to God and ask for forgiveness from sins  ?? Pay charity    To get to Hell is quite easy:  ?? No belief in God  ?? No belief in the Qur'an  ?? A polytheist  ?? One who does not ask for forgiveness from sins and keeps repeating them.    When someone dies, you do not right away go to Heaven or Hell; this is what happens:    ?? Its called Barzakh; you will remain in the grave.  ?? An Angel wakes your soul and asks you questions  ?? Based on how you answer, it will determine whether you lie in your grave peacefully or harshly.  ?? You are put back to sleep  ?? Then after everyone has died, there will come the Day of Resurrection where all the souls will be awakened.  ?? Everyone will appear before God and be asked about their deeds and what they did.  ?? Everyone will be put where they deserve: Heaven or Hell    Check this out as well:  http://rawkurdi.wordpress.com/category/i...  http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/20...

Belief in the predestination by Allah of all things, both the (seemingly) good and the (seemingly) bad.  http://www.missionislam.com/knowledge/si...    to convert to Islam:  http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/20...|`|vMAEeh66aa	Muslims beliefs the following:    Principles of Faith (Usl al-Dn)        * Tawhd (Oneness): The Oneness of God      * Adalah (Justice): The Justice of God      * Nubuwwah (Prophethood): God has appointed perfect and infallible prophets and messengers to teach mankind the religion (that is, a perfect system of how to live in "peace" ("submission to God")).      * Immah (Leadership): God has appointed specific leaders to lead and guide mankind  a prophet appoints a custodian of the religion before his demise.      * Qiymah (The Day of Judgment): God will raise mankind for Judgment - the Day of Resurrection    Branches of Religion (Furu al-Din)        * Salat (Prayer)  meaning "connection", establish the five daily prayers, called namz in Persian and Urdu      * Sawm (fast)  fasting during the holy month of Ramadhan, called rzeh in Persian      * Zakat (Poor-rate)  charity. Zakat means "to purify".      * Khums ("Fifth" of one's savings)  tax      * Hajj (Pilgrimage)  performing the pilgrimage to Mecca.      * Jihad (Struggle)  struggling to please God. The greater, internal Jihad is the struggle against the evil within one's soul in every aspect of life, called jihd akbr. The lesser, or external, jihad is the struggle against the evil of one's environment in every aspect of life, called jihd asghr. This is not to be mistaken with the common modern misconception that this means "Holy War". Writing the truth (jihd bil qalam "struggle of the pen") and speaking truth in front of an oppressor are also forms of jihd.      * Amr bil-Ma`ruf  commanding what is good      * An-Nahy ana l-Munkar  forbidding what is evil      * Tawalla  loving the Ahlu l-Bayt and their followers      * Tabarra  dissociating oneself from the enemies of the Ahlu l-Bayt|`|N8QLKpCMaa	SHADE !

When Islam we greet others by saying salaam alaykum which mean peace be with you      In Islam we believe that in life we follow the five pillars: 1. Profession of Faith  (shahadah) 2. Prayer 5x a day (salah) 3. Giving (zakat) 4. Fasting during Ramadan (swam) 5. Pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj)     We also have our six articles of faith that we believe in:  1. Faith in the unity of God  2. Faith in angels  3. Faith in prophets  4. Faith in books of revelation  5. Faith in an afterlife  6. Faith in density/divine decree    In the 9th month of the Islamic lunar calendar we celebrate Ramadan.  In this we fast for 30 days from the first light of day until sunset. In this moth we refocus our attention to god, purify our soul, and practice self-sacrifice. During Ramadan, every part of the body must be restrained. The tongue must be restrained from backbiting and gossip. The eyes must restrain themselves from looking at unlawful things. The hand must not touch or take anything that does not belong to it. The ears must refrain from listening to idle talk or obscene words. The feet must refrain from going to sinful places. In such a way, every part of the body observes the fast. At the end we of this we celebrate our self sacrifice by being in the presence of loved ones and enjoy good company.       This is just a simple over view of it.   I dont know if you are willing to buy book.  As an Islam I bought the book The Everything Book about Islam and it is great and simplified version of it and you can learn a lot of it. I have recommended it to many people and they have learned many for it.    Salaam Alaykum|`|aTqNidgBaa	http://www.sultan.org

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder; if you consistently think you are 'bad looking' they you will believe it eventually.  I am not one to judge your looks or beauty without seeing you or having a description.  And, then, I may have a different opinion than yours.|`|n7OHi5NAaa	Because you think that way.|`|a8ab0aeb90a2e327aa95201c6808e6cfaa	You know, God created you just the way He did on purpose.  You are a beautiful person on the inside, created in His image.  The outer flesh will one day die, but your spirit will live on.    I am not super attractive either in terms of what society thinks, but who cares.      what does matter, is what god thinks of me.  since I accepted jesus as my Lord and savior, I know he loves me, and has forgiven me of my sins.    i hope that kind of helps..

GqfiRXu3aa	--Do video games, movies, tv, etc. contribute to youth violence?    They only contribute to youth violence if the youth has a propensity for violence in the first place.  Otherwise, NO.  I grew up watching the same violent movies others did and I was not violent.    --Can parents contribute to youth violence?    YES.  If a parent is abusive, then a child can sometimes perpetuate that violence because that is what he/she was taught at home.    --How has youth violence affected you?  I'm 37, so it hasn't affected me very much.  Growing up, I didn't encounter much violence, except for a few times when I had to stick up for myself (the only time I think violence is okay -- when you have to defend yourself).    --What are the causes of youth violence?  BAD PARENTING.    --What can you do about/prevent youth violence?  Parents need to do a better job.  Teachers can encourage kids.  Kids need more after-school programs such as art, sports, clubs.|`|XhAFxWG5aa	yes video games and media and parents have effected youth violence.    youth violence hasn't effected me that much except it causes me to be more wary of fights    you listed most of the causes for youth violence up there you could add abuse and family situations    i cant think of a way to prevent youth violence though sorry hope this helps|`|xKjecOTYaa	The judicial system has taken away the ability to discipline children. If you spank your children, you can go to jail for "child abuse". My parents spanked me with a belt when I was a young boy, and I thank them to this day for disciplining me. When I was in school, teachers would paddle children who couldn't "control" themselves. Today kids run the classroom. My father was a U.S. Marine, and when he told me to do something, he wasn't playing around, he meant what he said. He used to tell me when I was a young boy, "Misbehavior has consequences, and sometimes those consequences are painful". That kept me inline!!|`|21734fbffcbf8e21d21f99205c491e6daa	Do video games, movies, tv, etc. contribute to youth violence?     yes    Can parents contribute to youth violce?     yes    How has youth violence affected you?    alot. But I am not a youth no more so I have to change and take responsibility.    What are the causes of youth violence?    things you have mentioned. Also the way they were raised. What they will become as a person has a lot to do with how they were treated as a child.    What can you do about/prevent youth violence?    start early. discipline early. before it's too late and they are already teens...on their way to juvie hall.

For example Kappa Sweethearts were the ladies who held the guys cane and cleared the sage during a step show. The only official group is the Iota sweethearts because it has been Inc.

W545hqrpaa	I dont think she would have a problem. Understanding is the best thing in the world.|`|ZNw6sxkjaa	It's very cool that you wife accepts you for who you are. You should tell her you wish to dress more fully. If she is cool with the lingerie then chances are she will be cool with you dressing up more. It is worth asking anyway- all she can say is "no"|`|swkhohjgaa	IF she accepts the lingerie then she probably will.

She also helped me dress up for Halloween parties twice.|`|3e6a7b1f3e03a56ef0cc271441e2531daa	You have to explain to your wife that while your are 100% heterosexual and happy being a man, you still have to admit that you derive tremendous pleasure from feminizing yourself.    And, you have to realize that your wife has a need to be loved and esteemed by a man.  She also needs to love a man she can respect and honor.  So your crossdressing pleasures have to be kept in balance.    I can tell you that your wife does NOT want you to develop a female alter-ego and give "her" a feminine name.  She doesn't want you to be a female impersonator.  That would create some fear that you might really be a transsexual.  She would probably allow you some freedom in wearing feminine clothes, but only if you can do so while maintain your healthy masculine personality.  After all, women can wear men's clothes without any problem because they do so without trying to act like a man.      In any case, your pleasure in feminizing yourself is something that you have to talk over with your wife, and you both have to make an effort to respond to eachother's needs.|`|UUJ5SqrAaa	Yes nice to see you two communicate.

x1rnK5VHaa	Normally I would suggest to be indirect and let him tell you in his own time.    However since you are dating (I am assuming that you are supposed to be exclusive) I would be direct in your approach.      First make sure that you are really ok with his being gay or bi.  If you are really in a committed relationship, then that may be harder on you then you realize.    If he is gay, then this will probably end your current relationship.  That doesn't mean you can't become good friends, however it will certainly change.  Keep in mind that if he is actually gay, then it will end eventually anyways.    If he is bi, then make sure that you both agree on the rules going forward.      If he completely denies it, then take him at his word, until he proves otherwise.  He may do this even if he is gay, and not ready to come out.  If this ends up being the case, then you may need to be the one to make the tough decision.    Personally I would say something along the lines of: I have this funny feeling that you find guys attractive.  It is ok with me if you do, just be honest with me so we can keep our relationship as healthy as possible.    However it goes, you will have everything in the open, and will be much happier in the log run.    Good luck.|`|H5CdsnByaa	Say something otherwise you're gonna end up like brokeback mountain and wait til years later and try to set him up by putting fish bait in his box that'll never get used. So just ask him, tell him you're cool with it, and that you want no secrets in your relationship.|`|0xz8mR2xaa	Yes, this needs to be in the open and fully discussed. I suspect that male friend is a f***buddy, and he may be picking up other people. You need to convey your thoughts on whether you want monogamy or an open relationship, whether he can bring boys home, how safe is safe enough for you, and any other concerns you may have. If you insist upon monogamy, things may not work out, but  I think he'll understand where you're coming from. If nothing else, keeping quiet may put you at risk for STDs.|`|0c9cGh8Oaa	Dont tell him that you went into his computer and that you know his secret !!! imagine how embarassed he wil be =S First of all he might be Bi. and second wether he is gay or bi he wouldnt want anyone to know so thats why he could be dating you .. Dont make it to obiece that you know .. begin to ask him small question such as : Do i look hot today ? or Whats ur favorite body part from me ? stuff like that i know it sounds stupid ..... Anyways after a LONG time you can finaly tell him.... or dump him .

funeSrxUaa	Yes it does.  As with any family, we want to protect those that are ours.  If we don't know the weaknesses/trials that one of our brothers and sisters are going through, it makes it difficult to help.  It also helps us build a stronger chord in which to tie ourselves with together.  The Holy Scriptures tell us to confess to one another so that we may be healed.    By becoming vulnerable to another brother or sister, they can see the struggles that they are going through.  If they have also gone through the same struggles and trials, they can be a good guide in getting through them.  If they haven't gone through them, perhaps they can still give good advice, or point them to some one who can help.  Logic would dictate:  Who would you trust more, one who has closed themselves off to everyone, or one who is open with their struggles.|`|r8rykCkGaa	It builds up the body of Christ as long as we are really loving the other one and edifying them.  Too often Christians are critical and sometimes even laugh at the other one or harass them.  We need to love one another as Christ told us to do.|`|LJlaHLQdaa	The Promise of the Spirit      And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever. John 14:16.              When Christ gave His disciples the promise of the Spirit, He was nearing the close of His earthly ministry. He was standing in the shadow of the cross, with a full realization of the load of guilt that was to rest upon Him as the Sin Bearer. Before offering Himself as the sacrificial victim, He instructed His disciples regarding a most essential and complete gift which He was to bestow upon His followers--the gift that would bring within their reach the boundless resources of His grace.          "I will pray the Father," He said, "and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you" (John 14:16, 17). The Saviour was pointing forward to the time when the Holy Spirit should come to do a mighty work as His representative. The evil that had been accumulating for centuries was to be resisted by the divine power of the Holy Spirit.          The promise of the Holy Spirit is not limited to any age or to any race. Christ declared that the divine influence of His Spirit was to be with His followers unto the end. From the day of Pentecost to the present time, the Comforter has been sent to all who have yielded themselves fully to the Lord and to His service. To all who have accepted Christ as a personal Saviour, the Holy Spirit has come as a counselor, sanctifier, guide, and witness. The more closely believers have walked with God, the more clearly and powerfully have they testified of their Redeemer's love and of His saving grace. The men and women who through long centuries of persecution and trial enjoyed a large measure of the presence of the Spirit in their lives have stood as signs and wonders in the world. Before angels and men they have revealed the transforming power of redeeming love.|`|hJX6Ur3taa	It is always best to have someone that we can rely to hold us accountable.

But God WILL forgive you. God did create you....he made only straight people, but then all the gay/lesbian people chose to be gay/lesbian......    I hope i did not offend you in any way...|`|jeqpSdtkaa	we're proof that god isn't real.|`|3TdT5mG2aa	It depends on how you interpret the bible. I do not think you will go to hell. Some people know when they are just babies that they are different. Being gay for most is not a choice. Sure, there are some that decide one day they want to be gay and the 5 days later switch back. However, those are the people that are not really gay. I think that if you are talking about going to hell alone, no I do not think gays or lesbians will. What makes loving someone a sin? Even if it is a sin, it is no worse than disrespecting your parents. Don't worry. Be happy. Love yourself for who you are. May you have the best life possible with all the judgment you will get. Good luck!|`|spceKsnUaa	i also heard its a sin to eat too much food.......|`|P3JsbI7gaa	okay, i honestly believed God made us this way.  and whether its wrong or right... i dont know.  i guess we have to wait til we die to find out.    edit: and last time i checked, we are suppose to follow the 10 commandments.  and it doesnt say anything about homosexuality. AND! ... John 3:16 says if you confess by mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord then you will be saved."  ... God loves us all no matter what or who we are.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Its only a sin because some book written by man ( the bible) says so. Different interpertations of the bible can make anything a sin. There are many churches that fully embrace the GLTG comunity. If you believe we were created than God created all us and loves everone equally. Never let words put down on paper thousands thousands of years ago in an acient language sway you. Personally I'm more of an evalution type guy but part of being free to chose is being free to choise beliefs. As long as you geniunly like yourself dont worry about what the narrow minded call a sin...thats between you and your god.|`|r9s0VyJgaa	Your officemate is ignorant and rude.  Homosexuality is NOT a choice, as you already know. Sexual orientation is an innate part of who we all are as human beings, as much as our skin and eye color, or right- or left-handedness. G-d created ALL of us -- hetero, gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered -- and he loves all of us equally.    And in spite of what your "holier-than-thou" officemate says, there is no hell.  ALL righteous people of every religion have a place in the World To Come.|`|cIvFOzoiaa	God did create us.  People just need some method to rationalize their hatred, and religion is one way.  Also, each person has their own beliefs.  If she believes that god won't let her into heaven if she's gay, let her believe that.  But you, being a lesbian, should just go by what you believe.  If it helps, my belief is we wouldn't be here or be gay if God didn't create us that way, so we aren't going to hell.    Also, you can choose whether or not to sin.  You can't choose your sexuality.  Therefore, being gay, bi, or lesbian is not a sin.|`|sANbdejNaa	GOD LOVES GAY PEOPLE. Stop thinking wrong ?or you go to hell? and will regret forever ok?|`|89sPanC8aa	Please don't believe what she said it is so not true. God created all people and loves all people no matter what they do, or who they love period.|`|H6D5e9poaa	Personally, i don't believe we were created.  I believe we evolved.  Now, going on the whole "Creation" idea, why would it even be possible to be gay (even to choose to be gay, if you believe that) if god didn't like it?    How could god teach to love everyone, but hate gays?      If you ask me, the bible makes little sense, and is quite contradictory.|`|kqEwr7graa	Wow  I hate her too.  Slap her!  I would|`|w7Ej7KFhaa	I don't know what I believe about God for sure. But I honestly do believe that if there is a higher power it did make me this way. I can't help who I am, and neither can you. And, it's not just humans that are homosexual. Several animals engage in homosexual behavior, are we then to believe that god didn't make them and they;re choosing, even though they don't even form cognitive thought. Homosexuality is in genetics, there is no choice in it, and if there is a god, he won't reject you for being how he made you.    Besides that, every time it talks about homosexuality in the Bible, it's talking about really bad people. God didn't burn Sodam and Gemorhah(sp?) because they were filled with gay people. He punished them because they were raping and behaving like really bad people.    People need to get their facts right, and realize that above anything else they're supposed to love one another, regardless of their sexuality.    Oh, and besides that people commit plenty of other sins all the time. Ask her if she had sex before she was married, same difference...if you want to even think ofit as a sin.|`|cpQU51teaa	don't listen to her!!! I believe I am created by my mom and dad|`|4HClQObFaa	What complete rubbish. It is clear beyond any doubt that gays and lesbians cannot choose their sexuality. Very few of them would choose the extra haslle and all the problems of being outside the norm.    But if god created anyone (which I seriously doubt) he created everyone and in my opinion if he created people like me who are gay then it would be blasphemous to doubt his wisdom.    And he has been doing this for thousands of years and the proportion of gay people has stayed pretty constant at about one person in ten.    So ask her how she knows what god likes and dislikes and challenge her to justify the hateful things she says.    Make her read Daniel Hammet's book "What the bible really says about homosexuality" and Alex Sanchez book "The God Box".    And tell her about animal farm and point out that all animals are equal and some animals are more equal than others is exactly the motto that she is adopting.

AA10032498	Euthanasia     2276 Those whose lives are diminished or weakened deserve special respect. Sick or handicapped persons should be helped to lead lives as normal as possible.     2277 Whatever its motives and means, direct euthanasia consists in putting an end to the lives of handicapped, sick, or dying persons. It is morally unacceptable.     Thus an act or omission which, of itself or by intention, causes death in order to eliminate suffering constitutes a murder gravely contrary to the dignity of the human person and to the respect due to the living God, his Creator. The error of judgment into which one can fall in good faith does not change the nature of this murderous act, which must always be forbidden and excluded.     2278 Discontinuing medical procedures that are burdensome, dangerous, extraordinary, or disproportionate to the expected outcome can be legitimate; it is the refusal of "over-zealous" treatment. Here one does not will to cause death; one's inability to impede it is merely accepted. The decisions should be made by the patient if he is competent and able or, if not, by those legally entitled to act for the patient, whose reasonable will and legitimate interests must always be respected.     2279 Even if death is thought imminent, the ordinary care owed to a sick person cannot be legitimately interrupted. The use of painkillers to alleviate the sufferings of the dying, even at the risk of shortening their days, can be morally in conformity with human dignity if death is not willed as either an end or a means, but only foreseen and tolerated as inevitable Palliative care is a special form of disinterested charity. As such it should be encouraged.|`|75dd16605038ea62b51122d325c0595faa	It's given to God when we are to die or if we are to live.

AA11297267	How's that again?

What people don't understand is that whatever a president signs into law or whatever,sometimes doesnt' take effect until the next few years.    So some presidents are reaping the rewards or disasters from previous presidential terms.
lHoDOF6Daa	God of the gaps generally means that you attribute that which you don't know to God. You say, "It must be because of God."    In the context you are using it, I don't think it is really God of the gaps. You basically are saying that you believe God is in charge of all things, and science is the explanation of "HOW" God does it.    So if you believe God is the "WHY," but science is the "HOW," then that is not really God of the gaps.    It is true that science does this as well. They automatically assume that any events that occur fall under the laws of our universe, when in fact, it may not always be true or even testable.    So to answer your question, in the context you use it really isn't God of the Gaps.    And...yes, I suppose science of the gaps is possible as well.|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	Please educate yourself on theories... I'm starting to hate it when people think theories are just guesses.       "God did it" makes me sick    By the way, Evolution and the Big Bang are full accepted among the scientific community|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Science: we don't know something, so we'll do our best to find out, and in the meantime don't pretend we do.    Religion: we don't know something, so obviously it's magic, done by our specific god.|`|GuTUQpSpaa	No, science admits that we don't know the answer when faced with gaps, instead of making crap up.  If something unexplained happens, science labels it "unexplained", while religion labels it "god's holy miracle" or "ghosts did it".|`|JpgLxU1Laa	come on dude, you still believe in the tooth fairy too?|`|LjsRfaskaa	In some ways I believe the same as you. That our modern sciecne is holding the answers and potential answers to a lot of questions.     I am fortunate in my beliefs because at last quantum physics is  catching up. Shamanic pricinples and quantum physics are both describing the same things.    God in the gaps is also true but it is us who do the mirricles not a sky fairy. The god in the gap is us, because , when we can shut up our internall chit chat with ourselves it allows or  creates a gap for the signal of our higher consiencness to come through loud and clear.    Practicing Shaman.. quantum physics rocks.|`|urIm4YaBaa	It's only the same semantically. It is not the same in process.    A "god of the gaps" idea is used to give a mystical explanation to something that is currently unexplainable. It is a fact asserted *because* there is no evidence.    When a person who accepts that naturalistic processes govern the world (such as many Atheists), then any phenomenon viewed is accepted to have a naturalistic process guiding it. This is asserted, not as an explanation, but as a starting point for exploring possible explanations (process is much different). In other words, the naturalistic process looks for evidence, and then asserts a cause based on what the process reveals.    Because science is used to explore naturalistic processes, the scientific method is the process that would be employed to gather the evidence.    Like I said, the difference is in the process: a "god of the gaps" provides an explanation of the event through unsubstantiated assertions based on the "we don't know right now" principle. "God did it" is the answer, not the process.     The opposing view, that an idea that the cause and effect are not mystical and can be explored, is a starting point for finding an answer is a process. It is not the answer in itself.    So, they aren't really the same thing in a different light. They're quite different in scope and intention.|`|czf6uhIraa	But it's still a scientific phenomenon, thus still science. Also, scientists admit that they don't know the cause, while Theists blame God.|`|f4ik0ScQaa	Scientists admit the gaps exists whereas theistic apologists quickly fill them in with a nice god shape.    Scientists may say that they believe or think that the current gaps will eventually be explained by science, but this is only because this has been the truth EVERY SINGLE TIME a gap has been identified previously.|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	Seems like you misunderstand the fundamental principle of science, which is - simply put - the search for knowledge. No one in the fields of science claim to "know all", and if there is an unanswered question, it's simply considered something we don't know....YET.    Saying "God must have done it" is basically the end of any intelligent line of inquiry.....a scientific mind will say "Hmmm, I don't know how that happened, but I'd sure like to find out"|`|AA11058044	From the examples you give, it would appear that your arguments do not or did not actually meet the definition of the "God of Gaps" argument.    In other words, the person you were debating was wrong - you don't actually believe in the God of the Gaps.    The God of the Gaps comes in when someone sees something they can't immediately explain, and says "AHA!  You can't explain that with your current knowledge, therefore God MUST exist!!"    This is quite different from saying "No one can explain this... yet.  If no scientific explanation can be formulated about this, someday, then it might be an example of something that could be within the purview of God."    The distinctions may seem subtle, but functionally come from very, very different places philosophically.|`|GDexucXKaa	No, no.     Let me give you an example.  I don't completely understand the weather, and how thunder, lighting, tsunamis and tornadoes happen.  But that doesn't mean I'm going to say "God does it," because I know that somewhere, there are people who CAN explain it, in a rational and scientific way.  I'm just not one of them.     And for other unexplained phenomena, rather than credit "God" for the "miracle," I assume that someone, somewhere either has or will soon have a reasonable, logical, scientific explanation for it.  And that explanation, if I ever hear it, will make a lot more sense to me than "God did it" ever has.     .|`|xopIi2Vfaa	Not really, because we do know natural laws (science) exists. We have a considerable knowledge about natural laws. We also know that we don't have a verified instance of natural laws being broken. If you claim a miracle, then you claim that a natural law was broken. It does not seem unreasonable to assume that this it not the case, but that the natural laws stayed intact, even if we cannot explain in detail the result of the event.   For example some people survived falling of high structure while other fall to death from the same height. We could assume that gravity was locally suspended for their benefit or we could assume that they did not fall on their head, their fall was broken by a tree or some other structure, they had so many clothes that they had a much higher resistance in air or whatever. We might not know what exactly it was what saved the person, but we assume that if every parameter could be reproduced in the same way another person falling off would also survive. As we can't ever reproduce all parameter we will never be able to prove it.  Nevertheless this will be a more rational explanation than the explanation that some supernatural event happened and the forces of gravity stopped working for a single person in a single spot and just for the critical amount of time without affecting anything else (e.g. no buckets on the ground that person was going to hit was rising into the air, not stones or bricks were seen flying upwards.)|`|VLxU5112aa	The "unknown" in science is only unknown to those who don't study it, not to the people who have actually done the research and experimenting.  Those who know the least are most likely to be the ones who say that science cannot solve their problems, and most likely the ones to fill the "gaps" with God.    You cannot believe that God created everything and science explain how at the same time.  Science does not point to a God.  You choose a side, or say that God created science.  Your views right now are self-contradictory.    And about the Big Bang: WRONG.  The Big Bang has been accepted as the true model of how the universe formed.  They have enough evidence to support their idea.  They cannot prove it 100% because nothing can be proven 100%, but if you have the evidence you have the case.    Try to understand that the word theory does not mean it's an idea someone thought up and hadn't bothered supplying evidence for.  It's just an idea, and in the cases of the Big Bang and Evolution, they're ideas with EVIDENCE.|`|YOynOfo5aa	Unlike god, the science  is very much capable to   fill in the blanks, step by step  In another words - Gaps of god are the same for ever  Science - take a simple penicillin (Fleming)  was not known in derived form till the third decade of the last century  Look at the antibiotics now  And resistant organisms to it, for that matter  In your hypothesis - God did it, or not..it is a miracle, mysterious way, gods will etc, etc  Science ADDS or DISMISSES all, by testing, what intends to be of use..God is stuck in the rut after the seventh day (the resting one) ever since  Nothing has changed|`|ZIEv070laa	theres a dif bettween beleveing in god and belevig in the bible

oVeGMNsLaa	Well, it could always be explained by biology.  Since gay men have been shown to respond to male pheremones in the same way that straight women do, it could be that you are able to feel attraction and form chemical romantic relationships with men.    Also, I would point out that while both genders can certainly have the same traits, male femininity is very different than female femininity, just like female masculinity is a totally different breed than male masculinity.|`|CDft5bscaa	Its (partly) because of your views on gender that you don't find certain feminine qualities unattractive, but that doesn't trump being born gay, unless you believe in universal innate bisexuality, then Iduuno what to tell you

Well I would follow him, sure.     However proof to me means absolute. I would need to see him personally descend from the heavens and perform a miracle or something to prove his divinity, then say, "I am the Christian-Judeo God" (or whatever God you happen to be talking about.) I don't mean something like an "answered prayer," that could very well be coincidence anyways.     And this is kind of a strange question for me... This is like me asking "If you found proof of a unicorn's existence, would you worship them?" It's just a weird concept...|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	It would definitely change my life, but I would still burn in hell before bowing to a tyrant.|`|X3PmWPUraa	No I would not worship him.  I look at all the misery in this world - famine, disease etc and would wonder what sort of monster created and this and this monster would definately not be worthy of worship!

I've got an idea, let's stick to reality.  There's no evidence, and thus I will not believe in God.    "What if" situations cannot be used as arguments or proof because they never actually happened.|`|fe9KIOn4aa	If there was hard empyrical evidence to point that a God does exist in some form, then there could be no refuting the existence of a God.    But, in order to change my lifestyle, we would have to determine what that God may or may not desire, if it even knows us, etc. Otherwise, I really don't see the need to change my lifestyle, etc, because one is said to exist. Besides, just because there could be evidence for a God, does not necessarily mean it is any God in particular. It could be Zeus, Odin, Ahura Mazda, YHVH, etc.    As for proof...I guess something observable that could be witnessed by multiple independant sources that can all come to a similar outcome, like saying "apple is a fruit" or stating our Sun is a star.    Agnostic Polypanendeist Pagan (basically I've done too much thinking to be healthy    Toodles    EDIT: Wishful thinking by both of us. There's a lot of questions that phrase it to "God", but often that term is used for the God of the Abrahamic religions and has specific connotations. If we were to say that there was a God regardless of how religions depict it, then we have no real conception of what it is then, so changing a lifestyle seems a moot point.|`|355JLlcLaa	Present what you believe is proof, so that I can evaluate it.

What do you do if you want to see the Queen or any big figures like celebrities, actors and actress?General public has to approach them. If one want to see or meet with them;they will not come to your door step. Reason they are big and important.but in reality they are also human beings like us.    Where as seeing God we want God to just appear to us or come to our home.Yet He is Almighty who created us tiny creatures and created the universe as well as rest of the worlds.  If God's creation is so huge and unlimited can one wonder about God him self.We are asking him to show-up; do you think you would be able to comprehend him, Nay we would die instantly.like a meta-fore what would happened to low amp fuse in a high amp it would blow up or vice versa.  Apart from that this life is test for the next life.and we have to do lot of revising from his Divine books final marks(On the day of judgement day) will be given from the last Text.(The Quran)for the people of this Era till the End.  Just for the minute If God was to show-up(physically) It wouldn't be a test then.Think! We have to contemplate seriously.  There are billions of people in the world who strongly believe in God.  How come very tiny tiny few are very brave! and the billions out there...  People who don't believe in God are the ones who need to show up to God.  I hope those get to find out the truth before it's too late.

At the very least, he'd be up on charges of criminal negligence and abandonment for his treatment of mankind from day one.    Not to mention the class action suit He'd be facing for his incompetent design work on the human pelvis alone.  Millions of women and children have died trying to push a big baby head through a pelvis constricted to a tiny opening because it was modified for bipedalism.  And that's not even including the number who have choked to death because He apparently thought it was a good idea to cross the repiratory and digestive tracts.    If God did turn out to be real, there would be an awful lot of people very, very pissed off with his criminal behaviour.|`|M4WIWMgBaa	Even if there was proof I would be unlikely to worship a god that could create so much misery.|`|snj9zznvaa	if that's what he wanted me to worship him but who says that what he wants  he who created the universe wants me to grovel to make him feel better egomaniac much|`|ba428f6f619bfc67fa65e92c90d4c839aa	Proof that he exists would not make me worship him.  At least not if he is the god that is talked about in the bible.  Why would I worship a mass murdering, baby killing, vengeful being that put us on the earth and then put thing here that will tempt us and tell us that we either stay away from those things or be punished for ever.  That is not a god worthy of worship.

Sometimes very smart people can be gullible or the need to be accepted and loved by a group can over ride rational thought.  Often people do not think rationally about religions or simply replace one with another.  Very often people do not have a good basis of knowledge to detect false claims or they simply want to believe.

Mormons, Scientologists and other especially strange religious are almost always insane.    Many Buddhists, Neopagans, Pantheists, Taoists and other such religions are above average in intelligence because although some of their beliefs may not make sense, at least they do not claim knowledge of everything or discriminate against people (homosexuals, women, etc).|`|8599c16fb8c024a84d9e0e7d395be5baaa	No. Particularly with Scientology that is not the case. Their recruitment strategy focuses a lot on well-educated people. And yet their beliefs are mindbogglingly absurd. If you listen to some ex-Scientologists, they were really smart and educated people, and yet they came to believe the most mindbogglingly absurd things.

47cb72348217a23e95b20db38d9cb65faa	Yahoo! Answers is pretty much Yahoo! Opinions.  While you do get some answerers that go out of their way to provide accurate information--complete with references so that the asker can do some of their own footwork--I don't think anyone would argue with me when I say that's a rare occurrence.  It's an even rarer occurrence that the asker chooses one of those answers:  Someone who answers with a one-word "yep" gets it, simply because that person is on the asker's contact list.    Or, of course, the answerer who best agrees with whatever position the asker has decided to have on the issue.

That being so, how can anyone possible comprehend or know a force that cannot even be described. All those who say they know and understand God are arrogant and egotistical.    We are said to be Gods image because of the way we can manifest and change matter, not because we look alike.  God uses the trinity and so do we. To be able to change or move anything three elements are needed and working together. The intent, the agent , and the energy to move it, such as emotion.    But God the sky fairy does not exist in reality and is just a blanket term for the unknown or unexplainable.    Practicing Shaman.. quantum physics rocks.|`|G4SwEHP5aa	Selfish?!?  Far from it.

He has given us degrees of what he has....love, justice, a degree of power etc but we are not like him the way you suggest, if we were, there would be no troubles in the world. We were made in his image but we were given free will, look at the world and u can see what we have chosen.  Secondly, there is nothing arrogant about true christianity.

True christian people are humble and loving ......i think u should study the Bible, u have it all a bit mixed up babes|`|nJatWOhsaa	Very much so.

Your question shows naivety at it's finest. You obviously don't understand Christianity.|`|hQPi5t1Gaa	I don't think so.  God has no image. He is pure energy.  Jesus is the teacher that was sent by God to teach this.  Many Christians have been terrorized by the "church" their entire lives. "Screaming, burning hell for you if you do not follow our doctrine" says this church or that one if you do not believe its specific teaching.   Jesus taught love understanding helping one anther AND self responsibility.  Made in his image. Yes, because Gods energy and life force is imprinted in our very being on the quantum level.   God is love.|`|ade88a86096da6caf982d633e21cd939aa	Each premise of your first three paragraphs is completely wrong.   How can the worship of another ever be considered selfish?

6SwaWSoyaa	I am kind of a walking ball of America's diversity.  I am biracial (black and white), I can speak english and spanish, with a little french. I play several musical instruments very well and have mastered them. Half of my family is methodist the other half is catholic, but I'm agnostic.  I'm gay. My mother is a single white mother, so just with me around that shows even more diversity within the family. I used to be very insecure about all of this, but now I wouldn't change it for the world because I realize it makes me unique. I know that sounds cheezy but it's true.|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	I wonder if an individual can be diverse. A population can be, because its made up of different individuals, but I think you want to know how I'm different from the rest of the nation?    Many, many ways. I'm gay, an atheist, married, white, female, a liberal Democrat, and test in top 1% in intelligence (which really just means I'm good at problem solving and logic). All those things make me different from a lot of other people. Is that what you were looking for?
iWcXFF38aa	Gifts for women for Valentines Day are so much more marketed than for men. You're right that it's almost expected that the guy buys the present for the girl.    But giving something to your guy can make the day that much more meaningful, especially since most guys don't expect anything.     The good thing about it is that the gift doesn't have to be as lavish as it is for us girls who expect roses, chocolate, jewelry, and more if we're lucky. But for a guy, keeping it simple is best: Some suggestions I have are:      1)  Organic Handmade shaving or bath soaps from a  place like Etsy.com.  'Going Green' is getting big and soap would be a great way to introduce your guy to healthier hygiene products    2)  A simple hand-written poem that really comes from you heart   written on nice paper    3)  You can prepare his favorite food item or sweet treat or snack or purchase it for him    4) You can give him a nice hand massage and groom his nails a bit, if you feel he may be open to that. A lot of men don't take good care of their hands and are too proud to go to a manicurist, but if it's done by their girlfriend then it becomes an intimate thing.    5) If you're up for a little more 'spice' to your Valentine's Day night you can get one of these 'romance coupon' books they sell at Amazon or at a bookstore like Borders.  Your love can redeem whatever is on the coupon. If you google 'romance coupons' you will find many to print for free.     6)  You can learn a few new movements of a sensual dance like Belly Dance or Salsa, and give him a free 'private' show.  There are many free instruction videos on You tube and Expertvillage.com.  You don't have to become an expert, just learn a basic move that you can 'wow' him with!    7)  Simply flirt with him in public for a few days prior to Valentine's Day to build up the momentum before the big day.  Be like one of those 'annoying couples' making everybody else uncomfortable and totally notious!  But you know it's only because they're jealous :)    8)  Do a totally 'guy thing' with him that you know he will enjoy and you would never do otherwise. You can even make your own  'romance coupon' so he can redeem the activity within a specified time, so you all don't necessarily have to do it on Valentine's Day. But he will still know how much you really care.      Have an absolutely fabulous Valentine's Day with your guy. :)|`|AA10405438	A nice card and a small gift like a cd holder or something he's wanted.|`|iHFZLsDTaa	1.  Gift ideas.

dmTVbpcWaa	Perhaps you thinking of the account at:   Acts 4: 1-21.   World English Bible     Acts of the Apostles 4       1.  As they spoke to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came to them,   2.  being upset because they taught the people and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.   3.  They laid hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day, for it was now evening.   4.  But many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.   5.  It happened in the morning, that their rulers, elders, and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem.   6.  Annas the high priest was there, with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and as many as were relatives of the high priest.   7.  When they had stood them in the middle of them, they inquired, "By what power, or in what name, have you done this?"   8.  Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "You rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,   9.  if we are examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed,   10.  be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, in him does this man stand here before you whole.   11.  He is 'the stone which was regarded as worthless by you, the builders, which has become the head of the corner.'   12.  There is salvation in none other, for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, by which we must be saved!"   13.  Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled. They recognized that they had been with Jesus.   14.  Seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.   15.  But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,   16.  saying, "What shall we do to these men? Because indeed a notable miracle has been done through them, as can be plainly seen by all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we can't deny it.   17.  But so that this spreads no further among the people, let's threaten them, that from now on they don't speak to anyone in this name."   18.  They called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.   19.  But Peter and John answered them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, judge for yourselves,   20.  for we can't help telling the things which we saw and heard."   21.  When they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for everyone glorified God for that which was done.|`|93galWG1aa	I think you have a reason.
