Yes, a roughly shaped stone ax with a hole is proof of intelligent design. Someone must has made it for a certain purpose.

See also   Matt 18:21&22......21 Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"     22 Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times      Mark 11:25.....And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins      It sounds pretty straight forward .

20090205050820AAfrZGe	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	It was Christ's enemies who thought that the Crucifixion was "good news." Why have believers sided with them?	Neither Christ nor his Apostles looked at the Crucifixion as "good news for mankind." On the other hand, the people who hated his teachings thought it would be good news if he was crucified.      Why have believers sided with the ones who wanted to get rid of him?      And moreover, Paul/Saul, who said: "Christ died for our sins," was among those who terrorized the first real Christians. So again, it appears that believers have taken sides with those who wanted to wipe the teachings of the Kingdom Gospel ("the kingdom is within you") off the map.      And it seems as if it is continuing... since there is a move on at this very moment to remove the words "the kingdom is within you" out of the Bible.      So when are believers going to become the "Children of the Light" and realize that killing a teacher sent by God was not good news for mankind?

20090205044900AAib2Ut	Society & Culture;Languages	It's just not fair! Why won't the US make foreign languages an absolute requirement?!?	Why does the US not make it a requirement to learn another language besides English? EVERY other non-English-speaking country has this as a requirement. I'm a US student in Denmark and EVERY person in the class knows AT LEAST 2 languages. Some know 3, or 4. But because I was born in the US, I only know ONE language. I don't think it's fair, and it pisses me off to no end. I was not encouraged to fully learn another language as a child (the crummy 1-hour French and Spanish lessons they gave us in Elementary school do not count; nor do the ridiculous middle and high school language classes). I feel that I was deprived.       Now I want to actually LEARN a second language by taking a Danish so that I can participate in their culture and expand my horizons. But guess what? I'm told I don't qualify for the class because I have not learned another language besides English. (The requirements are that you have to either have English as your second language OR have English as your native language PLUS be fluent in at least one other language). All of my fellow international classmates qualify...because they had the luxury of learning another language as a child.       It just pisses me off. I can't afford the expensive Rosetta Stone program, and besides, I feel like it would be better and more effective to learn a language in a class, with active participants and the ability to interact with classmates and practice what you are learning. It's no fun to pore through books and computer software all by your lonesome.       What's up with the US? When are they going to make foreign language learning a requirement? Maybe I should write to Barack Obama and bring about this change.       I think US citizens are being shortchanged by not being required to learn another language. I will make SURE my kids are fluent in at least 1 other language besides English.

20090205045801AAroVP5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did Jesus say:  "I am the door" ?	I've been told there is paradise on the other side of the wall of sin which is keeping me and everyone else out.  Then I was told there is a door (just one)  through the wall, a party going on over there and I'm invited. We're all invited !  Wow.    Now where's the door?         There are rumors about "other doors"  Hindu's have "painted" a door.  Buddists and others painted theirs.  Try to go through them though and you just bump your nose.  Along comes Jesus Christ and actually makes a door and then sends His friends out to the world to tell everyone about the door and invite them all to the party.  heh heh   Some believe it and go through it.  Some scoff in disbelief and dont even look.  Some say there is no wall, no door and no party.  And some say there are three doors.  oh oh.     Jesus said:  "I am THE DOOR.  Not a door, but THE door.  There is only one door.  "No man cometh unto The Father but by me"   The Lamb says in TheBook of Revelations to The Church of Philadelphia:  "I know they works, you have a little strength, I have set before thee an open door which no man can shut.  You have kept my word and NOT DENIED MY NAME.       The Jews at the wailing wall in Jerusalem cry out to God for their Messiah.  There's a door, just go through it.      Jesus says:  Strait is the gate which leads unto life... and few there be who find it.  When we are baptised in the Name of Jesus Christ and recieve His Spirit, we go through "The Door".  When Churches of The Trinity baptise with the titles of The Trinity, they strip away the Name, Blood and pre-eminence of Jesus and get wet.  They bring their flocks beautifully right up to the door which leads to life and then DO NOT GO THROUGH IT.  Jesus is the way the truth and life and there is no other.  "Broad is the gate which leads to destruction and many go in thereat"  (95% of Christendom is baptised with the titles)   In TheBook of The Revelation of Jesus Christ, The Lamb says:  "I am The Alpha and The Omega"  That doesnt leave much doubt about Him, does it?  He is The Right Hand of God.  "To whom hath The Arm of The Lord been revealed?"        Lets go to the party !

20090205050351AAQH3N9	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What are the day-by-day side-effects of FASTING that are to be expected in a forty day-and-night fast?	One of the proofs that Jesus was a Human being was:       MATTHEW 4:1-2.    THEN was Jesus led up of The Spirit   into the wilderness to be tempted of The Devil.  2. And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights,   he was AFTERWARD an hungred.    THE AVERAGE modern Christian knows little or nothing about FASTING, and does not want to learn. They would prefer even agonized death for lack of knowledge about simple fasting, than to learn about it.    FASTING is not THIRSTING.  Jesus was HUNGRY, not THIRSTY after his fast.  FASTING is not HUNGERING.  It was only AFTER his forty day and forty night fast that he was hungry. Hunger is caused by the secretion of gastric juice- whose production ceases after THREE days of fasting.     There are important spiritual, mental, and physiological effects and benefits to fasting, which those who have never seen it nor done it before cannot anticipate.       ROMANS 16:17-18.    17. Now I beseech you, Brethren,   mark them which cause divisions and offences   contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned;   and avoid them.  18. For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ,   but their own belly;   and by good words and fair speeches   deceive the hearts of the simple.    PAUL WAS NEVER a REAL Christian, but the Sower of Tares.  How can GOOD words deceive? Paul left many important things out of "his Gospel," as he called it. Such as JESUS' ACTUAL TEACHINGS. What he gave the church was enough for Christians to fight with one another over, until they are destroyed.   As was his master plan From The Beginning (1st Cor. 3:1-3).    Since he did not teach The Truth about fasting, there was no way for the churches he taught NOT to fall into being "led by their bellies."  The FIRST thing you learn in fasting is how recently digested food in general, and the glycogen stored in the liver and muscles in particular, DRIVES BEHAVIOR, so that we THINK, SAY, DO, and even BELIEVE things that we ought to know we should not. It takes three days for the stored carbohydrate to be depleted ffrom the body, forcing the release of special enzymes to break down the fat stored in the adipose tissue. ONLY when this is done can REAL fasting be considered to have begun.

20090205052657AAkZLlQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can a woman be a pastor according to Christian teachings?	I have debated this issue quite a bit with my gf.  I was taught that a woman, while equal to a man shall not be able to take on a head leadership position in the church according to the teachings of the Bible. Reference is 1st Timothy where paul speaks and says "I suffer not a woman to teach..." -KJV  and goes into detail.  I do not recall the chapter but timothy is a rather small book.  I am serious in what I believe and do not mind being proved wrong but yet I want to know for sure so I do not teach the wrong thing.  PLZ if you have answers GIVE BIBLE REFERENCES and EXPLANATIONS.  If you cannot back it with a verse do not waste my time.  Thank you and God Bless.

While I don't spend as much time as some people do on Y Answers, I feel that I spend enough time for my own personal needs, but it has become increasingly obvious that some posters, of both questions and answers, will show racial contradictions in terms of their own opinions.      What I want to know is:  Why is it okay for someone to post negative comments about those question answers who come off as racially discriminating when in the end they are seen posting replies such as 'I don't care about people of other races, just my own... blah blah blah'?      This makes no sense to me, as these people are quick to cry out works such as 'racist, biased, etc' towards those people who do come up with something that is racially separating and picking or poking at one specific race or races.  But when they aren't really paying attention to their own words in some replies or even their own questions, they are fairly racist themselves.      Yeah this will probably bring out the haters, but that is okay, can they handle the truth of their own actions?

Is it that whenever there comes to you a messenger with what ye yourselves desire not, ye are puffed up with pride?- Some ye called impostors, and others ye slay!   PICKTHAL: And verily We gave unto Moses the Scripture and We caused a train of messengers to follow after him, and We gave unto Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs (of Allah's sovereignty), and We supported him with the Holy spirit. Is it ever so, that, when there cometh unto you a messenger (from Allah) with that which ye yourselves desire not, ye grow arrogant, and some ye disbelieve and some ye slay?   SHAKIR: And most certainly We gave Musa the Book and We sent messengers after him one after another; and We gave Isa, the son of Marium, clear arguments and strengthened him with the holy spirit, What! whenever then a messenger came to you with that which your souls did not desire, you were insolent so you called some liars and some you slew.

You could not hold a conversation with her without her quoting scripture, or telling you how Jesus would want you to improve your own life.

I understand that you kids have you friggin' "lingo", but come on, you have a ******* spell checker right there that tells you when you might have a misspelling!! It's not like you have to go search for the ****, IT'S RIGHT THERE!!! Seriously, when did sounding ignorant become a trend? I'm glad I missed that era.
20090205061307AAWQRoI	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	In a lesbian couple, is it accepted that both partners would wear an engagement ring?	A friend of mine is planning to propose to her girlfriend and wonders whether they should both wear and engagement ring, or if it is unusual for just one partner rather than the other to wear one. Any thoughts?
20090205062242AA3kwf6	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	How do you distinguish a Japanese from a Chinese?	First, I'm Korean.   When I was in England to learn English for six months, I used to have some unpleasant experiences.   Of course, there are some racists in every society.   When I was wearing blue jeans and T-shirts, they thought of me as a Chinese and started to insult me with an offensive middle finger.   And they said, "F**k Chinese!".   On the other hand, they were very kind to me, when I was wearing a suit. And some of them even said to me with a smile , "Konnichiwa",(meaning 'Hello' in Japanese) as a sign of welcome.   Actually, I'm neither Chinese nor Japanese.   I was under the impression that the British people tended to regard every oriental man from China or Japan.   Of course, we Koreans also have a tendency to think of every Western traveller, especially a white person, from the United States, whether they are really from Canada, Australia, Britain or any other European country.   Then how do you normally distinguish a Japanese from a Chinese, on the assumption that they don't say a word?   Maybe by how well they are dressed?
20090205061253AARQqIF	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How did this REALLY happen?	Have you read the recent news story about the four year old little girl who managed to crawl into the front loading washing machine?  According to the papers and police reports (although still under investigation) the girl's 15 month old little brother managed to start the machine ultimately leading to her death.  Her cause of death was ruled as "blunt force trauma to the head".      I'm confused on this part for two reasons:   1) How did the 15 month old REACH the control buttons?  I understand it is front loading, but generally those that I have seen have the start/operation buttons on top. Not saying it couldn't happen or that all machines are built that way -Im' just saying the fact that a 1 year old could reach even the top of even the front part of the machine is a stretch and being able to start it unless he just randomly pressed many buttons over and over.      2) It said it took the mother "several minutes" to realize what had happened.  Now I know accidents happen and they happen fast.  But even after several minutes, I wouldn't think she would be dead yet.  And even in the event that she couldn't stop the front loading maching because generally those don't stop until done, I personally would have been unplugging that machine as FAST as possible.      While it is a sad tradgedy, and I hate that it happened to any child -or parent for that matter, I still feel it was somewhat preventable and somewhat questionable.  I know kids are smart and they get into stuff, but that poor little boy is actually going to have to live with the fact that he killed his sister like that.  And the mom COULD have just NOT let them play in the laundry room...don't you think?  I don't let my kids play near electrical outlets etc. for a reason.      What is your take on it?   Do you think it's possible the mother had something to do with it?   Was it an accident in more ways than one?

20090205064513AAzRDy8	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Am I transgendered?????????????	When I was little, I hung out with guys and girls. I had my first kiss with a guy and my best friends were girls. I wore girly clothes and was never afraid of adventure.      I have liked guys, but never felt afraid to talk to the guys I didn't like. I still had all girl friends.      I think I have always been depressed, never felt 100% with my body, I have always wondered what it would be like to be a guy.      I used to be interested in nail polish and jewelry      I feel like a guy 80% of the time now, but when I feel like a girl, I feel a strong emotion      When I feel like a guy I feel depressed.      I love being a girl, I think      My mom says I am not transgendered, but would she know? She thinks she would be able to tell from when I was little. She and my father will never believe me if I am.      I don't really want a sex change, but at the same time I want to know what it's like to have a penis.

20090205064719AAtXQ8o	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	How right is it for muslims to beat a girl for tattooing  ‘Shukr Alham Du Lillah’, meaning ‘Thank you, God’.?	Pak girl beaten up for sporting tattoo in Urdu          22-year-old Saba Najam was at a Malad mall last week when some women beat her up and dragged her to the cops over a tattoo on her back..      Riyaz Ahmed Talukdar, a member of Jan Seva Sangh, a local NGO, had first spotted the tattoo on Saba’s back and informed his mother, Shabana Talukdar. Riyaz said, “When I saw the tattoo I was furious as holy words from the Quran were on her back.” Shabana, along with a few other women, then came to the mall in the next 15 minutes and confronted Saba in the washroom.       They slapped the girl several times before the mall management intervened.          How right is that?What should have these guardians of Islam done,instead of beating a girl and parading their faith?Afterall,she tattooed on her back,not on V.a.gi.na,right?

20090205064451AAnmfAY	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	What do you think of this?	I attend a music school. The girl in question and I have perfect pitch. Ever since I attended the school, people have always compared us (she was there first). However, everyone always talked about how I'm such "a great pianist". I never did anything to fuel these conversations, I simply practice and perform at concerts. Once, I had to perform at a concert before she played her instrument, and she rolled her eyes before taking the stage.      The girl, usually and quite often, treated me cold the whole time. One semester, we were both taking a composition course and the girl asked me to play the piano part to one of her pieces. I was surprised, but I thought that she had simply decided to be friendly. I agreed to play.      She gave me the score and it contained lots of sixteenth notes and grace notes that do not lie under the fingers well (she was not a pianist). I asked her about the tempo of the piece and she said that it was very slow and that I didn't have to worry. Because we were using many of the same instrumentalists, she also requested that we hold our practice at the same time and take turns working on each of our pieces. I agreed to this also.      During the rehearsal, she started out conducting at a breakneck speed. I noticed that all of the other instrumentalists had whole notes and I was the only one with faster notes. (The saxophonist had a few triplets for about four measures, but he had his part for about three months because he was her boyfriend.) I could barely keep up, and I'm usually a competent pianist. Every time that I would make a mistake, she would look at me with an evil look and then look at her friends with a smirk. She then began to conduct even faster, almost to the point where it fell apart. She would call out every note that I missed (as if she had perfect pitch and I didn't - we BOTH do.) Her presence and her attitude made me so nervous that I missed even more notes because she stood extremely close to me and look over my shoulder as I practiced and announced my mistakes before taking her score away. In addition, she used up all of the rehearsal time, which she said that we would share, so that none of the instrumentalists had time to practice my piece.      Afterward, she sneaked and told the teacher of the class that I did not do well in rehearsal and that she couldn't use me as a pianist. On top of that, she boldly stood in the practice room and called out every note that I missed and then asked for her piece back.      As a competent musician, I have never been through such an ordeal. What do you think that she was trying to prove by making me appear to be incompetent?  Was it on purpose or an accident?      Additional Details:   (By the way, I think that she might be a little "unstable" in her perfect pitch abilities because I often notice her humming flatly and then playing a note on the piano to get into "tune" for that day. People with perfect pitch usually don't have to do that.)      I don't know... she could be faking the whole "perfect pitch" thing... but I haven't told anyone that; it's her business!

20090205060741AA94ZRA	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Why is it when you ask for advise people automatically judge?	as far as i can see on YA theres a whole range of issues that make people judge and sometimes their opinions are unnecessarily hurtful. for instance- people on benefits, taxpayers (and i was 1 before i became a stay at home mum- no i'm not on benefits and no i never had a problem with people on the social) have no problem with their tax being used for other silly reasons by our government. and also, stay at home mums VS working mums. its a wee bit pathetic. why can't we accept other peoples life choices? whenever possible i try not to judge someone else- because even if what they're doing isn't 'right' its not my life! from reading on here, there's a lot of people with some very ridiculous views
20090205063015AA1kO6z	Society & Culture;Etiquette	What should I do if a co-worker does not get disciplined for stereotyping native americans?	Okay, this is for a mature answerer only.  Before I ask my question, if you're not going to give me a mature and respectful answer, this question is not for you.  I am native american and I was raised on an indian reservation my whole life.  A guy at work was talking to me and we got on the subject about living on a reservation, he then said "If I lived on a reservation, I'd become an alcoholic."  I obviously became offended and told him how disrespectful his comment was and that it was a stereotype.  He knew my race and knew where I was from and even after telling him it wasn't right what he just said, he repeated it to me, AGAIN.  I mean ... come on, he tried to make me feel like I was wrong for being hurt.  I thought he was my friend, but I guess not.  I wrote a letter to the director of human resources and nothing was done, no discipline or anything.  Is that acceptable?  Again, if you're mature I'm sure we'll ALL be able to tell who is and isn't based on their answer.  I'd appreciate anything helpful.

One thing I have noticed about the world of work is how passive aggressive the conflict has become. I missed the good old days when people who had a beef would talk it out and if necessary would yell and scream and then would get it out in the open. Now it seems like all work place conflict is passive aggressive where they will roll their eyes, give the silent treatment, talk about you behind your back, make up lies, go to your boss and complain and other underhanded ways to solve conflict.      What approach do you use when you have a beef with someone at work and what is done at your job?

I understand they had quite a party for Jane. Another person in the office (Alice), had a birthday and because she was not as popular (but nicer inside), the company did nothing for her.      I refused to participate in the birthday party for Jane (the popular employee) because they had a special party for her but not for Alice and other less social coworkers.  I was written up as a poor team player.      What is the polite thing to do?

20090205060409AAcbECc	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	I lost about my relationship or something .. help     ramadan?	O.k. So my boyfriend ..well fiance..? AH ok so my boyfriend and I have been together for 8 months. He's Muslim. My parents are evangelical Christians.Ive been going to my parents church since ..my whole life but i don't really consider myself a evangelical Christan ..or a devoted Christian for that matter. So to me it doesn't matter what Religion he is. I love him ..I can't even express how much I love him..i know it because i feel it. He tells me he loves me everyday and I know he means it. But ever since we were together he sorta fell into love too fast.He told me he loved me right away and that he wanted to marry me. . He still wants to marry me...he says he wants to have a family with me and everything..now.. but..I don't know if its because he really loves me or hes pressured from his parents to get married. He has told me he wants to settle down since hes at that point in his life he wants to be serious..hes 25..im 20. I've asked him about his parents ( havent met them) like what do they tell him..do they want him to get married soon. He said yes he said that his mom is always asking when are you going to get married..but he swears that's not the reason he wants to marry me  not because hes pressured. He wants kids...he wants to marry and have kids soon in the next four years...that will mean im 24. Honestly i love him..but i feel im too young..but he doesn't want to wait. I know he loves me but i dont know if hes in a rush and wants to marry me becuase he wants to please his parents..and himself..or because he really does love me. Ive also asked him if his parents would be ok with him dating me...he told me in the beg. of the relationship that he never really dated..unless he wanted to be kicked out of the house. Now i never really understood that...till now. He's very set on marrying me so basically he thinks of me as a fiance not a gf.  I am guessing his parents are really religous. Which scares me because im really scared that they wont like me..that there will be problems and ive told him this. He tells me.." its my life they will have to deal with it..they will like you" which scares me more they will have to deal with it??? That means theres a huge chance that its not O.K for him to be with me. He has told me he loves me and hes following his heart. There have been times we argue and he says he must think with his head not his heart ..and that he didn't think i could change. But never once was it because of my religon  it was because of my attitude...but then we work it out and everythings fine. So i know he loves me for me. Honestly i am willing to convert ...and not just becuase i want to be with him. I guess im sorta lost. I'm just scared his family wont like me and there will be problems..I love him so much..but also i want to wait to get married but he doesn't want to. Also sex is sort of an issue he wants to wait..hes a virgin ..and im not..and i sorta get you know tempted with him but he tells me to calm down..and i do ..but i dunno was this even a question...OH and i guess im just worried about how are families are sooo different...my parents are from mexico....I guess im just worried that his family will not like me...and there will be problems and well end our relationship ...but he tells me that wont happen.....wow i ramble...BAH ugh i have to go to work.  ( yea i didnt reread cuz im late so if it doesnt make sense..sorry!!) if anyone even answers!

20090205061159AAt0lCe	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Life after death. Doesn't eternity sound like a bit much?	I personally find the idea of existing for eternity exhausting. Maybe for the first couple hundred years with all the excitement of living with all your needs catered to by a loving God whom you love back and are having just the greatest time of your existence would just get old after a while. So Christians, when you really think about it. I mean honestly give a though,not just give some quick "joy joy God forever" response. Don't you think you'd get tired of eternity? No matter how many new things you can be confronted with, in the great scheme of eternity, will get old.

20090205061533AA7nxcJ	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	How do I establish myself as a "serious" business woman without men getting offended?	I am 26. I'm currently trying to break into the music industry as a song-writer/artist/consultant. I have my Bachelors degree in Mass Communications/Print Journalism and have worked for a few magazines and newspapers. I currently work as an Administrative Assistant for a University as well. Okay, well---every time I meet people who always happen to be men who are in the music industry---it's like getting through THICK RED tape just to get taken seriously. No, I don't dress provocatively. No I don't engage in sexual innuendo conversations. No I don't have dates with them or sleep with them. It's just the opposite. I present them with my goals/visions/work---yet they get mad when they realize I'm not interested in "getting it on" with them. This is becoming so FRUSTRATING...because I feel like, I have to "be this ditsy flirty" chick for men in the business/music world to take me seriously.

Ok, so i'm not crazy..nor am i a teenage dreamer, i'm not emo or want to slit my wrists and i don't want to drink blood..    But since I recently read Twilight my mind seems to have gone slightly out of control. I have always believed in them (ghosts, witch's, vampires) if i'm being honest with myself, (I used to sleep with a cross and a rosary until the age of about 14) I seem to 'feel' when a place is haunted, not that I have ever seen anything though. I don't know exactly what i'm trying to get out of this but it's something that i now have on my mind. Has anyone ever really met a real vampire? if so, where? what happened? I don't want to hear back from goths who think they know about this stuff because they wear black and feel different for this.. I want to hear back from people like me.. who are normal, who just have that feeling like i do.

I'm about to watch a lot of my class graduate and I'm not going anywhere. I'm still stuck here at UMSL. I don't even like this school. I am glad I get to be home with my family though. My mother is everything to me. If you haven't met her you should. She's awesome. I'm grateful to her and my bro for taking care of me.   I really want to graduate so I won't enter the next school late. That means I'll be older when I finish. I'm supposed to graduate in December. I hope I'll be able to. My lab course is really hard. They don't care about how clean your workstation is, how nice your lab notebook is, if you did the calculations correctly, etc. The only things they're concerned with is the final number. For example, did you come up with the right amount of zinc. I suck at lab. I forget stuff, spill stuff, can't do the technique right. I might not pass this class=( That means it'll be the only thing holding me back because it's a prereq for the classes I must take next semester.   I'm taking an intro to psychology class. I'm really interested in how the mind works. I even study it on my own time. I wish I'd made my major psych. It also seems easier than chemistry. Our professor is VERY interesting-lol. She's teaching sex ed too, so that's practically all she talks about. She keeps students awake but I wish she would stay on topic b/c I really want to learn this stuff. This is the only class I'm taking that I can say that.   I'm volunteering at the humane society. I love it! I get to work in the office AND with the animals. My favorite are the little kittens. They're sooo cute! I love volunteering. It's better than me sitting around feeling sorry for myself, which I'm pretty good at.   Also, I'm still working on loosing weight (I've lost 2 lbs-lol.) And not thinking about race so much. I think it's easy to do so when you're a minority. But I'm working on giving people a chance even though I've been hurt in the past. Finally, I'm working on letting go of the past. I've done a good job lately...I think.

For I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.    3“You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain.    4“ Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.    5“ Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the LORD your God is giving you.    6“You shall not murder.    7 “You shall not commit adultery.    8“You shall not steal.    9“You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.    10“You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor’s.”

20090205071919AAUvklS	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Is Judd unfairly targeting wolf hunters while ignoring those buying meat from factory farms?	The issue was highlighted on Tuesday when the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund opened a campaign called “Eye on Palin,” targeting the governor for what they call her “extreme anti-conservation policies, " pertaining to wolf hunting methods in Alaska.      The campaign spokesman is Ashley Judd.      If Judd buys meat derived from animals that have been slaughtered at a factory farm. Or, fish caught in nets?        Or, if she supports politicians who eat meat and fish... is she being hypocritical and short on objectivity regarding the plight of all animals slaughtered by man?      Animals suffer in small cages or pens for months, then they are often dismembered alive at factory farms, when they are not successfully knocked unconscious prior to slaughter.      Fish are often raised so quickly from the depths of the ocean in nets that their eyes pop out.      Hence, if she eats meat or fish, or supports politicians who do, she is sanctioning animal killings that are also inhumane and painful, and she is part of the animal abuse problem.      If she is going to address animal rights and target people as offenders, shouldn't she address the larger picture and all politicians involved on all levels?

I'm not sure if she was being sarcastic, if she thought i was rushing them, or is she was trying to help things move along......in no way i was trying to rush them though. i was simply checking up on them. cuz if i dont check on them, then its "bad service", "where was the waiter", if i do check on them...then its "rushing".      what do you think? what do you think?      thanks for your responses

20090205070852AA63Dvc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	The Fall of Man interpreted, what do you think?	Here is my "interpretation" of the fall of Man. (KJV / NAS).      According to the Holy bible and starting with Genesis, Ch:3 Versus 1-12.       Gen.3, 1-12   Verse 1:      Now the serpent (ungodly creature) was more crafty (clever) than any beast (ungodly creature) of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman, "Indeed, has       God said, "You shall not eat (believe) from any tree (teachings) of the garden (earth)?       And the woman said to the serpent (ungodly creature), "From the fruit (wisdom) of the trees (teachings) of the garden (earth) we may eat (believe);   but from the fruit (wisdom) of the tree (teachings) which is in the middle (fire) of the garden (earth), God has said, "You shall not eat (believe) from it or touch (understand)       it, or you will die (be away from God)."      And the Serpent (ungodly creature) said to the woman, "You surely shall not die (be away from God)!. For God knows that in the day you eat (believe) from it your eyes (mind)       will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."      When the woman saw that the tree (teachings) was good for food (knowledge), and that it was delight to the eyes (mind), and that the tree (teachings) was desireable to make one       wise, she took from it's fruit (wisdom) and ate (believed); and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate (believed).      Then the eyes (mind) of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked (away from God/spiritually dead); and they "sewed fig leaves" (blaming each other) together       and made themselves "loin coverings" (excuses).      And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden (earth) in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid (subconsciously ignored) themselves from the presence       of the Lord God among the tree (teachings) of the garden (earth).      Then the Lord God called to the man and said to him, "Where are you (Why are you acting different)?" And he said, " I heard the sound of Thee in the garden (earth), and I was       afraid because I was naked (spiritually dead/lost/disobeyed/sinned) so I hid myself (ignored my subconcious).       And He said, "Who told you that you were naked (away from Me(God)/spiritually dead)? Have you eaten (believed) from the tree (teachings) of whcih I commanded you not to eat       (believe).      And the man said, "The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me from the tree (teachings) and I ate (believed).            The end.      So here you are ladies and gentlemen, my spiritual understanding of how it all started off wrong. False Wisdom made us knowledgeable but put us away from God and numbed our       senses to hear God. Or bluntly said "spiritually dead".      Peace and Love, all comments are welcomed. What do yo think?

20090205065734AASd8nj	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Who was Khadijah the Great?	‘When none believed me, Khadijah did. She made me a partner in her wealth’.   Those are the words of Prophet Muhammad (Pbuh) about his first wife – Khadijatul Kurba.      Khadijah, the daughter of Khwalilid, was born 15 years before the year of the elephant, in 555 CE. Her mother was Fatimah Bint Zaidah.   She was a noble, fine-natured wealthy lady of Makah. She married the Prophet when she was 40 and he was only 25. They had six children;    Two boys: Al-Qasim and Abdullah and Four girls: Zainab, Ruqaiyah, Umm Kulthum and Fatimah.      Khadijah lived with the Prophet for 25 years and was his only wife during that time.      When the revelation came from Allah and Muhammad (Pbuh) was made the Prophet, it was Khadijah who immediately accepted the faith and became the first Muslim. She was 55 years old at the time. Her acceptance of Islam greatly helped it spread amongst the Makkans. She stood by the Prophet all the time.      The Prophet and Khadijah had many sorrows. They had to bear the death of their sons Al-Qasim and Abdullah in their infancy and in the fifth year of the prophet-hood their daughter Ruqaiyah travelled to Abyssinia with her husband, Uthman Bin Affan.      Khadijah had to also bear enormous strain and suffering during the boycott at Shi’bi Abi Talib for three years.      She died on the 10th during Ramadan at the age of 65. Her death was a great loss to the Prophet.       Muslim women should emulate the example of Khadijah who loved her husband dearly and did everything of Allah’s sake. We need more women like Khadijah today.
20090205070210AAclEzp	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are there any Christians that believe in the theory of Evolution and in Jesus Christ?	How can that be? The entire purpose or reason for Christ coming was to return man back into the former state that He created man in: In His Likeness and Image.       Christ came as a direct result of Adam's sin - which resulted in all humans dying.       So, it means that unless you believe that God created Adam, you cannot accept Christ's salvation.       The Orthodox Churches accept the story of the Creation as Real.   But how can other churches view this story as just a story, and not a real incident? To not accept this as a real incident contradicts with the faith.

20090205081607AABJPqb	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Are some passages of the Qu’ran parables?	Hi, I’m a new student reading about Islam; thank you in advance for your patience with my errors and for whatever guidance you can provide.      I decided to start my study of the Qu’ran simply picking out a passage which was appealing, before starting at the beginning of the text.  When the serious study starts, I’ll  read the passage and footnotes, and contemplate the Book in order.  But for now, it was a suggestion by a friend, who once mentioned a Chapter in the Surah “The Cave,” titled “Travels of Moses in Search of Knowledge.”  This is Section 9 of Part 15, Chapter 18, verses 60 – 82.  I read it as a favor to him years ago, then again because I enjoyed it.      The beauty and simplicity of the story was at first enough to keep any contemplation of deeper meaning from me; there are no extraneous words in a story describing the actions of spiritual men, Moses (pbuh) and His servant, and the Unnamed Teacher, dedicated to God.  The inspiration of the Qu’ran is evident in their honesty and goodness – even the least of the three is a good example to others.  The story was much as I would imagine a father talking to a child, implying this is the way men should act, and remains profound after enduring translation.      In contemplating the story, I developed three questions:      1. Is this history or a parable or both?  I know the difference in centuries between the lives of Moses (pbuh) and Muhammed (pbuh), but because there is nothing beyond God or His prophets, my curiosity is piqued; I have not read the story anywhere else.      2. Are the major lessons of this story the rewards of obedience and the importance of not leaping to conclusions or judgment?      3. Not a question about the Qu’ran, more current events:  The story reads reverentially toward Moses (pbuh) as a spiritually-oriented, sincere young man in development.  Given the current conflicts between Israel and many Muslim countries, is there a fundamental respect for the teachings of Moses (pbuh) still in Islamic culture?      Again, thank you for your guidance.

When someone like Michael Behe proposes that the blood clotting mechanism is irreducibly complex, why does he not vigorously research the databases of vertebrate genome sequences.  Shouldn't he be attempting to reinforce his claim with evidence, and what better evidence for the irreducible complexity of the current blood clotting system than to demonstrate that no parts of the system, separate from the whole, can be found in any genome sequence of any vertebrate?  Seems that such a momentous breakthrough in scientific discovery would cause him and other advocates to race for all the evidence they could muster.

20090205070459AAlWCbo	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do we REALLY want a heaven on Earth?	I honestly don't think heaven on Earth would be such a good thing. Just think about what heaven actually is.      -It's ruled by an angry dictator that demands worship and praise, and that you never attempt to oppose his rules or decisions.   -These rules include completely conforming to his standards in terms of beliefs and values, and accepting that all are to be judged by his personal set of moral standards that nobody is allowed to challenge.   -Anybody that goes against his personal moral standards or refuses to simply worship, praise and conform to the standards of this dictator is instantly cast out into a place where all they know is pain and suffering.   -Anybody who wasn't aware of this dictator and his rules by the time they reach this place is also instantly cast out into a world of pain and suffering, as punishment for their ignorance.   -Once you are cast out, you are forever in exile, never given a chance to come back.   -Within this place you must constantly remain under the conditions set to you, without exception. You may not break any rules, even if they make no sense from a logical or moral standpoint; you may not challenge any beliefs or values, or form any individual ones; you may not disagree with anything the ruling dictator says or decides. Doing any of these will have you cast out, and you are not provided a chance to appeal the decision or receive a lesser punishment.      I suppose once you get past all that it's an ok place if the dictator in charge likes you, but I think we could do without it personally.

The side dishes don't bother me too much (they are just awkward) but if I don't move the cup to the left I end up reaching for the wrong cup most of the time and I will sometimes knock mine over accidentally because it is in my way (which is embarrassing and makes me look clumsy).

20090205073817AAkhLoH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is this a misinterpretation of the Bible?	There are some 39,000 different denominations from the Bible . . . which means there are thousands of different interpretations of these teachings. Thus, is it OK for me to have my different interpretation as well?      My take on the Bible is that Jesus is teaching that heaven and hell are within each of us right now (not necessarily a place we go to after we die).       That, and that "getting to heaven" is something that we strive for while living . . . the same thing as enlightenment or self awareness in other religions.      Finally, I don't think we're different people. I think we're all the same person . . . we just see different people as one sees different waves in an ocean. The waves are really part of one entity.      Anyway, these interpretations are different than what my church teaches. But they make sense to me. Is it wrong to make my own interpretations? Do you think I'm way off?      Let me know your thoughts.

I know there is no greatest prophet really ,but in your human perception  which prophet was extremely unique in the powers manifest through him or the theophanies witnessed by him..but that's a hard one too coz J.B met Jesus in the flesh and Moses saw the burning bush and saw God face to face.Ezekiel,Daniel and John of Patmos all saw God in his heavenly glory with the holy host.    Moses wrote the first five books of the bible and Isaiah it could be argued spoke for the whole bible.His words are enough to sum up the entire Old and new testaments...Elijah and Enoch never tasted death so who is the greatest?    Is it Moses,Isaiah,Elijah,Enoch,Ezekiel,Daniel... the Baptist or even John of Patmos?

I was thinking something along the lines of:      "Where ever you are, I will be there too."      "Close together or far apart, there is a special place for you always in my heart."      "Just think of me, and I'll be there."      If you think this idea is not a good one, please let me know, in a nice way! Thanks everyone!

Now i have been in a heated debae with tons of people over this. i'm not saying "Jesus" was a real person but what I saw kinda proves his false existance. Also there were so many comparisions to all of these other gods before him and the similarities were just amazing.

I have the privilege of presiding over this meeting this year.  It will be most memorable because I have chosen this night to not only partake of the emblems from the platform but to usher my way out of the evil organization we call The Watchtower Society!      I have my own outline and a new set of scriptures I will have everyone read. Before I am done there may not be enough Matzo and wine for all the partakers!  It's a good thing my wife is baking a LOT of it!      I will also announce my departure from the Witnesses.  My hope is to draw away many followers to Christ!

I find it incomprehensible.  But I've been wrong lots of times before, and beside that, there remains a crucial question.  If your understanding of the text is wrong, where did your view come from?  Who is the oldest source to explicitly espouse your view of the Mass?  If this was the view of the earliest Christians, that fact must be accounted for.  If it's not too much trouble, could you help me out by documenting this belief in the earliest Church?      as always, thank you for your thoughtful answers

20090205091419AACAr3W	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What does the Bible have to say about giving people the "silent treatment?"?	Please forgive me if I start to rant, but I am really upset about this.      The person nearest and dearest to me is a devout Christian. Needless to say, because of our differing beliefs, we sometimes argue.  We also work through our differences because we care about each other (or so I thought).      Last week we had another of our arguments. It was less severe than a lot of our arguments in the past have been, so I thought it would be cleared up by now. I was wrong.      I apologized profusely, admitted to my wrong doing, took the blame, explained why I reacted as I did, and asked forgiveness. I am now receiving the silent treatment. It's been a week, I've tried to talk, and I'm just being ... shunned.      This really hurts me, because he knows how I react to rejection, and that, due to various circumstances, I live in social isolation.  I feel that he is only isolating me further, is dishing out punishment by deliberately controlling the situation, and is behaving in a cruel manner.      I would just like to clear the air and put this behind us, but I also understand that he may not want to talk  about things right now. That's fine. All he has to do is say that he needs time, and that we'll talk later. I'd quit dwelling, and I'd be able to just let it go.      If he no longer wants to be in this friendship, that's OK, too. I understand. But he needs to tell me.       This constantly being met with silence is starting to get to me. It's only widening the chasm between us, and I'm afraid the damage that's being done is going to be something we can't fix.      So, what I'd like from you is a bit of what the Bible says about giving people the silent treatment (shunning). If you have any other advice that might come from the Bible, that would be great, also.       I try to see things through his eyes, and in a language he understands. If you have any Biblical references for me to peruse, then I might gain some insight into how to approach him, and how to deal with this situation.      Thanks for your help, and my apologies for the length.
20090205090422AAVFxKY	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Is it weird to tell my old boss that I am busy with my schedule?	Let's say my formal boss wanted to make plans with me or better yet, if he was still my boss and if he is in charge of me, and I told him: "I cant hang tonight. I got to work." (thats if he is no longer my boss) but if he is still my boss and wants to do something with me after work and I say to him: "I cant tonight. I have other plans."      Would this be kind of weird? Especially because he is in charge of the schedule?      And if he used to be in charge of me and in charge of the schedule and I tell him I have a tight busy schedule, wont this be kind of weird that I am telling my own old former boss this and he may be able to take advantage and make the decision of when I come to work or not.

20090205093416AAvf7YT	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is there anything man could come up with, that he understands any more than the bible proves man to know?	How can man trust man to bring facts on evolution, or the age   of the earth, or any major facts sought to be known, if man    finds something as simple as the bible, the begining of the    history of these men and the things they did down through    these thousands of years that no two men can calculate    even the years involved correctly or know what they mean?       Most use the excuss that they do not believe it, rather than   have a team agree to present it as it is, regardless. Just tell    it like it is.      How many have studied it out with intent to tell it like it is?      If the bible was really used to judge the world, as John 12:   47,48 says, how are we going to rate our own self at being    able to help it judge us?      If a donkey was as important in the days of the Judges as it was    in the time of Jesus, so be it, no book author will sell me his    book if he makes fun of this fact.      A book is a book, get serious!

Matthew 7:21  ? Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that DOETH the will of my Father which is in heaven.     Proverbs 24:12   12 If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man ACCORDING TO HIS WORKS?     Matthew 5:16   16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good WORKS, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.     James 2:14-26  14 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?     15 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,     16 And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?     17 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.     18 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.     19 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.     20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that FAITH WITHOUT WORKS IS DEAD?     21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?     22 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?     23 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.     24 Ye see then how that BY WORKS A MAN IS JUSTIFIED, and not by faith only.     25 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?     26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.     Revelations 20:12-13   12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and THE DEAD WERE JUDGED out of those things which were written in the books, ACCORDING TO THEIR WORKS.     13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged EVERY MAN ACCORDING TO THEIR WORKS.     James 1: 22-23  22 But be ye DOERS of the word, and NOT HEARERS ONLY, deceiving your own selves.     23 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:     Romans 2:13  13 For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the DOERS of the law shall be justified.     I am not denying the need for and importance of faith.   The Bible teaches that we should have faith.      What I am saying is that according to the BIBLE as clearly pointed out, we need works as we will be judged according to our works.   We are justified in our faith by Jesus Christ, but he also judges us according to our works.   We need to have good works or we will be judged accordingly as the Bible points out.    John 5:22  For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:

The church wants to be self reliant and independent from everything else. That way, it will succeed on it's own or collapse on it's own.        http://www.sltrib.com/lds/ci_11628940       This is exactly what is happening in other religious aid programs. Half their entire budget comes from Federal grants. They use this money to manage their church aid programs and pay salaries. Since, federal aid money is reducing, these humanitarian programs are having impossible ways to keep their own programs running. If Obama ends aid money altogether, than church aid programs will completely collapse.

20090205093657AAzbcJm	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why is there an organization against the defamation of Christians?	I'm asking this question because, I noticed there's a website devoted to those who speak out against the defamation of Christians and "anti-Christian" prejudice.     I could see that being in some countries, where Christianity is barely tolerated, but seriously, its like the pot calling the kettle black. Most Christian based organizations and websites defame other religions for not believing as they do and as "false" and "the devil's doing". Many of them go as far as to demean other denominations and sects (Protestants vs Catholics, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons). So what's with the whole "watch for defamation of Christians" when no one can't even agree on what a Christian actually is, let alone the huge lack of tolerance many religious Christians have on others.
20090204223416AAdYzRN	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Why go girls treat me differently when my mom and dad arn't around?	If I am with my parents and I see people I know (especially girls!!), they play miss innoccent and say: "oh hi." when they dont really mean it and just pretend to be nice but WHEN I AM ALONE, THEY ARE SO SNOBBY TO ME AND NEVER SAY HI TO ME OR MAKE AN EFFORT TO DO SOMETHING AND THEY TREAT ME AWFUL!! Like a perfect example is if I see some preppy snobby girls in the area and I am by myself, of course they treat me horribly and never talk to me or never would want to make plans to do anything with me and always are too busy for me BUT HOWEVER, when I am with my own friends and with my family and I dont want to be bothered, the same snobby girls will act differently around them and they wont give lame excuses about being busy but instead they will say in a fake friendly way: 'Hiiii. You must be his parents. Very nice to meet you. I really want to make plans with your son. He seems like a sweet guy." and of course they arnt themselves when they say that!! then I tell my parents: "Look dont fall for her. She's just saying that to be nice because you are around and when I am alone on my own, she is snobby!" and my mom is like: "Hey show some respect. she seems like a nice girl!!" and the preppy girls are the ones who are behaving differently around my mom and of course the same girl I see who met my mom wasnt acting charming the next time I saw her and completley ignored me.      So my question is, why do girls do that?!! Why do they act differently around my parents when they really dont like me?!!

The argument goes something like this: "I refuse to prove that I exist," says God, "for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing."       "But," says Man, "the Babel fish is a dead giveaway isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED."       "Oh dear," says God, "I hadn't thought of that," and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.       "Oh, that was easy," says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing.       what say you now?

My family, including extended family members, are full of successful people, but I always seem to fail at everything no matter what all because I have an anger problem since I was 8. My parents used to have a bad temper and my grandma did and still do, but they kept it in the family. I tend to explode only in public bc I respect my family too much to do it at home. I had been suspended alot in high school, got restricted to online courses in college (physically kicked off campus), ditched by friends/boyfriends, and recently fired from my job. Yet, everyone else go on to be professionals (doctors, etc.) or if theyre still young, seem to be excelling at school or entry level jobs. Most of them are overseas, of course, but I'm still tired of standing out. They're successful bc they can govern their temper. I fail bc I can't. My real question is, "Why do I always lash out at people (verbally abuse them, NOT physically) and physically assault objects when it's uncalled for?" Because that's what got me to fail. Should I just resort to passive-agreesive anger instead of aggressiveness? (I do both currently.)

Lets say the person who was born to a mother who is not married to the father of the child, grows up and is a good christian and goes to church and all that. What do you believe happens to him/her on death.       It says in Deuteronomy 23:2 that “No one born of a forbidden union may enter the assembly of the Lord. Even to the tenth generation, none of his descendants may enter the assembly of the Lord."      So what happens to that person?      This is a question for christians, atheist don't bother answering because im not looking for your opinion of heaven not existing.

20090205065453AApFhSJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	The prominence of fear in the bible?	i don't know what the actual frequency of the command to fear God in the bible (KJV, for my purposes) is, but i seem to come across it rather a lot ( ecclesiastes 12:13, 2 corinthians 5:11, deuteronomy 8:6, for example). it is easy to understand a lot of the commands, not to murder, not to steal, to love one another, to be just, to do unto others as you would have them do unto you, but to fear?       why should the most benevolent and wise being desire our fear? it may well be a powerful motivator but it doesn't seem the sort of tactic that would continue to be effective through time. personally, i find it paternalistic at best and tyrannical at worse.      the accusation is often leveled at believers that their faith/religion is based on fear and it seems to me there is, not for everyone (i hasten to add), some truth in that.  it may not be based on fear of death or on fear of the unknown, for what was once a mystery (a total eclipse of the sun) has been elegantly and confidently elucidated by scientific endeavour.  nevertheless, fear seems rather too prominent for my liking.      all that simply to ask, if you are confident in your faith, whether you would mind sharing how you interpret the multiple commands to fear God?      Once again, i ask this simply out of curiosity, with no hidden agenda or desire to cause offence to anyone. i just want to know what you think R&S.       p.s. it's my birthday today, yipee!!! i can smell the cholocate cake :)

I am an 18yr old FTM transsexual and I recently just got my prescription for T (without counseling). Sadly money has been an issue, so I had to ask my parents to help me pay for it, then I would repay them in two weeks. My dad told me last night that it is illegal to give T to someone who has not gone through counseling. He also says that he's talked to quite a few other FTM's and they shocked that I was able to get it this fast. He is also trying to scare me about health reasons. I think I can convince him if I have enough evidence that you don't need therapy.

20090205083642AAPM8WP	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Why du'aa is answered?	Praise be to Allaah.   Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:   “Du’aa’s and ta’awwudhaat [prayers seeking refuge with Allaah] are like a weapon, and a weapon is only as good as the person who is using it; it is not merely the matter of how sharp it is. If the weapon is perfect and free of faults, and the arm of the person using it is strong, and there is nothing stopping him, then he can lay waste the enemy. But if any of these three features is lacking, then the effect will be lacking accordingly.”   (al-Daa’ wa’l-Dawaa’, p. 35).   From this it will be clear that there is an etiquette and rulings which must be fulfilled, in the du’aa’ and in the person making the du’aa’. There are also things that may prevent the du’aa’ reaching Allaah or being answered – these things must be removed from the person making the du’aa’ and from the du’aa’. When all of these conditions are fulfilled, then the du’aa’ may be answered.   1. Sincerity in making du’aa’. This is the most important condition. Allaah has commanded us to be sincere when making du’aa’, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):   “So, call you (O Muhammad and the believers) upon (or invoke) Allaah making (your) worship pure for Him (Alone) (by worshipping none but Him and by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allaah’s sake only and not to show off and not to set up rivals with Him in worship)” [Ghaafir 40:14].   Sincerity in du’aa’ means having the firm belief that the One upon Whom you are calling – Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted – is alone Able to meet your need, and it also means avoiding any kind of showing off in your du’aa’.   2. Repentance and turning back to Allaah. Sin is one of the main reasons why du’aa’s are not answered, so the person who is making du’aa’ should hasten to repent and seek forgiveness before he makes du’aa’. Allaah tells us that Nooh (peace be upon him) said:   “I said (to them): ‘Ask forgiveness from your Lord, verily, He is Oft-Forgiving; He will send rain to you in abundance, And give you increase in wealth and children, and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you rivers.’ ” [Nooh 71:10-12]   3. Beseeching, humbling oneself, hoping for Allaah’s reward and fearing His punishment. This is the spirit, essence and purpose of du’aa’. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret. He likes not the aggressors” [al-A’raaf 7:55].   4. Urgently beseeching and repeating the du’aa’, without getting exasperated or bored; this is achieved by repeating the du’aa’ two or three times. Restricting it to three times is preferable, in accordance with the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) liked to say a du’aa’ three times and ask for forgiveness three times. This was narrated by Abu Dawood and al-Nasaa’i.   5. Making du’aa’ at times of ease, and saying more du’aa’s at times of plenty. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Remember Allaah during times of ease and He will remember you during times of hardship.” Narrated by Ahmad.   6. Seeking to draw closer to Allaah by calling upon Him by His Most Beautiful Names and Sublime Attributes at the beginning of the du’aa’ or at the end. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allaah, so call on Him by them” [al-A’raaf 7:180].   7. Choosing the clearest and most concise words and the best of du’aa’s. The best of du’aa’s are the du’aa’s of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but it is permissible to say other words according to the specific needs of a person.   Other aspects of the etiquette of making du’aa’, although they are not waajib (obligatory), are: to face the Qiblah; to make du’aa’ in a state of tahaarah (purity); to start the du’aa’ with praise of Allaah and blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It is also prescribed to raise the hands when making du’aa’.   One of the things that helps to bring a response to du’aa’ is to seek the best times and places.   Among the best times is the time just before Fajr (dawn), the last third of the night, the last hour of Jumu’ah (Friday), when rain is falling, and between the Adhaan and iqaamah.   Among the best places are mosques in general, and al-Masjid al-Haraam [in Makkah] in particular.   Among the situations in which du’aa’ is more likely to be answered are: when one is mistreated or oppressed, when one is travelling, when one is fasting, when one is in desperate need, and when a Muslim makes du’aa’ for his brother in his absence       http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/5113.    assalamo 3alaykom wa rahmato LLAH wa barakatoh.

20090205081843AAbyRtp	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, are you really so scared that atheists wanna take your god away?	Ok, that's not really my question. I asked a question yesterday about an item in the news: a nurse got suspended for praying (unasked) at a patient's bed.      I stated that a praying nurse at my bed would make me feel uncomfortable, because to me it would imply there was something horrible going on that the doctor hadn't told me about. I'd wonder why I was dying, when I only came in to have my appendix removed. I wouldn't be offended, I'd be uncomfortable. And scared.      Anyway, a number of answers stated that atheists are trying to take god out of everything, and that it would be horrible if even nurses get punished for simply praying. It's apparently an insult to freedom of religion to not wanna have a nurse scare the hell out of me by praying at my bed.      Sometimes I don't understand the answers I receive, really.      So, to make me understand the answers I got a little better, I wondered. Christians, assuming you're in a hospital to have your appendix removed (with freedom of religion in mind) which would you prefer:   A) A Muslim nurse at your bed, face fully covered in a burka, loudly praying to Allah for your safety   B) A nurse at your bed, with a voodoo-doll   C) A nurse at your bed, telling you right before surgery that she "really, really hopes you'll make it, because there is no heaven"   D) A nurse at your bed, telling you it will all be fine, because with the doctors you're in safe hands.

I use a path to get home from school and back, there is a stair way in the way...    On those stairs, 1-2 meters beyond... there are 6 or 7 students gathered, talking, and smoking, it doesn't really smell like regular tobacco... What should I look for in the scent (I don't risk holding my breath for more than 25 seconds, thus, I get a whiff)...        Where I live, Ontario, Canada, it's illegal to sell tobacco products to children under 19 (unless law is messed up, illegal to smoke too)... But I doubt the principal or police will care about regular cigarettes...      If I'm sure enough they are illegal, or tiny amounts of second hand smoke add-up to be harmful, I might anonymously report to crime stoppers, or my principal...      BTW the kids don't really bug me...      Questions:      1) Will second hand smoking (cigarettes, or other drugs) cause major harm 7-8 seconds a day, 5 days a week?

20090205082601AAZBh43	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Brothers and sisters...Have you ever considered your prayer life in the Lord in this way?	Our prayer with the Lord has two aspects. One is vertical, between us and the Lord, but also horizontal, with other believers in the 2's, 3's and more ( eg.. the 120 who prayed in the upper room in one accord in Acts)      Some of us pray only by ourselves, and neglect to pray with others and vice versa. One cannot replace the other and we need both in order to be a well rounded balanced healthy believer.      Having said that, I'd just like you ask regarding our personal prayer life.   This kind of life is somewhat hidden, just like the roots of a tree are hidden, yet if the root life of a tree is healthy, then the whole tree is healthy.  If the roots are deep, the tree will have a stong and prevailing way to go on.   I remember seeing a tree in my back yard as a child, that was chopped down and a stump was left.  Within a space of time, because the roots were still good and healthy, little shoots began coming out. It looked a little bit strange to me at first, but the message was profound.   Our root life, our prayer life is critical to us as believers.     Many times storms will hit us, we will  be blown this way and that. For some of us, we can bend and take the pounding because of our strong root life or we can be like some of the Pine trees that I grew up seeing near the sea shore in the caribbean, and they are uprooted and tossed about. The whole tree collapsed because the roots were not deep.         This kind of picture I am presenting to you, does it make sense to you or speak something to you about your prayer life?   Is it your desire as well to be  like the tree planted by the river of water?  Where our roots go deep into the Lord, tapping into the hidden springs?  Where what people see outwardly ( shoots, branches etc) is a direct match and reflection of our root life ( prayer life)?          Grace be with all those who respond.    Thank You for your portions.   In Christ   sandy

According to some Christians, people have to accept Christ before they die, because God rewards faith, not knowledge and presumably faith is impossible after death because then people know that Jesus is who he said he was.  Yet Thomas did not believe until he saw the scars and touched them for himself.  Faith would be impossible for him even before he died.      Why didn't Jesus curse him for his lack of faith (as he cursed the fig tree for not bearing fruit), if unbelievers really have to accept Jesus before death?

However, Jesus would never harass or try to legislate against homosexuals either.  He would love them, equal to how he loves you, and he would let them live their lives according to their own choices because free will is necessary to God's plan for us all (fictionally, anyway).  So, hateful Christians, why don't even Jesus' reasons work to make you treat others fairly?

I'm not expecting a word for word perfect translation but anything that conveys the message of a sort of kinship and sisterhood without real family ties.      I've tried a few online robot translators but I don't trust them and was hoping for a human input.      Many thanks.

20090205082258AAZvtpH	Society & Culture;Etiquette	My girlfriend dumped me after my brother played a prank on her (need advice) ?	Last saturday my gf was at my house and we were sat in the living room watching TV, with my younger brother (who is 13) and her best friend. She got up to get something from the kitchen and when she sat back at down, she set off a woopie cushion which my brother had put on her seat when she left the room, then he discreetly spayed "fart spray". My brother is a little immature but he always does pranks like this whenever we have guests over and the guests usually laugh and go along with it. But this was my gf's first time over, and she was very embarrased and angry. I didn't notice him doing it btw but she immediately left the room, went to the bathroom in floods of tears. I tried to comfort her and explain but she didnt want to be anywhere near me. Then she left with her friend. I called her the next day to apologize for my bro's prank but she said she believes I was in on it and that she doesnt want to see me ever again. At first I thought she was just overeacting and would get over it, but she hasn't replied to my calls and texts all week. I'm afraid that I've lost her forever just because of one stupid prank.       How can I prove to her that I wasn't in on it, how to convince her that she's overreacting and has nothing to be embarrased about (in other words she should loosen up a little). Most importantly how do I win her back? SERIOUS answers only please, I've tried asking my friends and my dad for advice but they just laugh at the whole situation.

For Valentines day, I decided to buy a mixtape jumpdrive from thinkgeek.com and make an hour long playlist for my boyfriend. Problem is, I want to make it flow well and all the songs to be relevant to our relationship. Any suggestions?      BTW: Our song is "First Day of My life" by Bright Eyes and I already have the songs "luckiest" by ben folds and "i feel it all" by fiest. My boyfriend is also a DJ, so I want to impress him a little bit lol.
