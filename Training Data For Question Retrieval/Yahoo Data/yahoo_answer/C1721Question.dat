20090222215443AAWHAd5	News & Events;Current Events	I really need help with this relationship dilemma. Anyone with past experiences please!!?	This is the story. My husband and I have been together since I was a preteen. I am not in my twenties. In those beginning years up to about I was 18 we had a best friend. He was mainly my best friend. Lately, I have been stuck on wondering what would have happend between me and the best friend had I notbeen with my husband. My husband is an amazing guy, and I honestly don't believe there is a better man out there. He's never done anything to hurt me at all. When Im upset or anything he's always there. I want to be good for him, and I want to be the wife he deserves, but I just can't help but wonder and sometimes I go see the guy (nothing ever happens, and my husband knows. He just trust me.) The guy knows how I feel and he feels the same way. I feel so guilty because my husband is such a good guy, and I would die if I ever lost him. I'm just so stuck because I told the guy I had to stop talking to him because I couldnt do this to my husband,and then I missed him for weeks and weeks till I finally gave in and started talking to him again. Now, I want to stop talking to him, but his father wasjust in a horrible incident, and I dont want him to feel alone. I'm just so confused. Also, the best friend doesn't compare to my husabdn in no way. I just can't leave him alone, and I don't know why. Please somebody help me and tell me what I need to do. I have prayed to God for the strength to let him go, and I know it may take time, but the guilt is overwhelming and Im just so lost. Please help

20090222222320AAoZKjB	News & Events;Other - News & Events	I need info on a huge fight that happened in the Uk a couple of decades back between the socs and the greasers?	I'm trying to teach my students about the power of the media and I remember a really interesting event that occurred a couple of decades back (I think) that perfectly illustrates what I'm trying to teach.       There was already an existing rivalry between the two groups (socs and greasers) but a soc and a greaser got into a fight on a beach on night and the media sensationalized it and told everyone about this huge big war that was going on between them and even hinted at this great big fight that was supposed to take place.      The two groups heard about this and rallied behind their groups taking the report at face value and hundreds of them turned up at the beach the next night for a huge big fight and quite a few people were injured all because of a media report.       Can anyone give me any more information on this or let me know where I can find some information?

Le forze dell' ordine dicono che hanno le mani legate perchè sono minorenni.

Come mai non si fanno interventi di questo genere sui ragazzini rom?   Chi li manovra , perchè non viene richiamato?   secondo voi, la linea dura  potrebbe servire?

20070927175618AAqJzgp	News & Events;Current Events	Why does China insist on supporting dictators?	As if supporting the Sudan genocide, Stalin and the Khmer regime weren't enough, China is now throwing it's support behind Myanmar/Burma.  They vetoed any chance of condemning the military junta crackdown on protesters that have left at least nine confirmed dead and who knows how many non-confirmed.  The country has a long history of torturing and raping it's citizens, forcing the majoriy to live in squalid conditions while the leadership dines in luxury as demonstrated by the military dictator's wedding.  I realize that this is common place in China and so long as Chinese don't have the balls to stand up for their own rights I dont' give a sh!t about them.  But to deny brave Burmese who are knowingly risking their necks for the sake of their countrymen's future a simple acknowledgement of their struggle is the ultimate betrayal of human rights.  I'd gladly pay 3 times the price for a pair of socks to be sure I wasn't supporting such a supporter of tyrants.
