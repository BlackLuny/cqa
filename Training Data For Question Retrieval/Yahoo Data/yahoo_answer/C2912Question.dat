20090203100053AAKmFsd	Environment;Alternative Fuel Vehicles	Would this type of Alternative Fueled vehicle work, in your opinion?	Take a diesel set up (high compression, same fuel delivery set up) and instead of using diesel, if you injected water (or a mixture of water and alcohol to avoid freezing) into the cylinder, wouldn't the high compression turn the water into steam, thereby causing the pistons to travel up and down?
20090203100148AANJ4nA	Environment;Global Warming	Environment News!! PLEASE HELP ME!!! ?	Is there anything going on in North America, that is sort of shocking, that has to do with the environment.

20090203101326AATcbyz	Environment;Global Warming	If a Democrat Politician gave a Global Warming Scientist $250,000.00, Why Wouldn't He Believe It's Man Made?	John Kerry gave a "gift" of $250,000.00 to Jim Hansen for his "work" on "Global Warming".  The quid pro quo was that Hansen would support Kerry in the 2004 Presidential campaign, claiming that Kerry's stance on "Global Warming" was better than those of President Bush.      While trying to avoid the perception that his science was for sale, Hansen stated that he would have voted for John McCain except McCain did not receive the nomination.  However when John McCain was the presidential candidate in 2008, Hansen shunned him and gave his support to Obama.      Since Dr. Hansen is the focal point on who receives government grants for research, why would anyone question that if you want to continue in the field you are going to:      1) Support your local Democrat candidate   and   2) Toe the line that "Global Warming" is man made?      To show that there is a bias in western science, Russian scientists attribute the Sun's activities to "Global Warming".  They can back this claim up by accurately predicting the current cooling trend.  Their long range predictions show that the Earth is going into a deep cold period lasting over 40 years.      So is "Global Warming" a political or scientific issue?  Clearly scientist have political agendas as shown here by many of the posters.      And if "Global Warming" is political, then why should funding continue unless the "skeptics" recieve equal funding?

20090219190556AAJDK5E	Environment;Other - Environment	My house smelled like gas or something today??  Should I be worried?	This morning when I woke up the downstairs bathroom smelled like gas, or something.  (We live in a end unit, townhouse with electric water heater, and electric stove.  We have no chimney, and no space heaters of any kind, no gas)  I left the house in the morning around 10am and came back around 2pm and when I opened the door I smelled it, so it was thru out the house (downstairs only) and a little stronger.  My dog was here the whole time and was fine when I got home.  Me and my husband can't figure out what it could be coming from.  My youngest daughter has heart problems and respiratory problems.  But it didn't seem to affect her, at least I don't think it did. I am worried about carbon monoxide poisoning, but didn't think that was possible since we didn't have gas??  Does anyone have suggestions of where it could be coming from?
