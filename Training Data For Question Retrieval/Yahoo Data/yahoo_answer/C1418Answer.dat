Just because we've got the technology required to make up a calculator doesn't mean we stop teaching basic math skills.

BhumxInEaa	Not at all clear, but probably tenuous.<br>  <br>  In classic trade theory, all other things being equal, in the long term, if the exchange rates were set by the market (floating rather than pegged), then the long term exchange rates would be such as to maintain the balance of trade (i.e. imports = exports).<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rates#Balance_of_payments_model" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_ra...</a><br>  <br>  This is one reason that the U.S. government has been hitting on China to revalue its currency. The Chinese currency is pegged to the dollar and so doesn't float. That means the exchange rate can't adapt to the trade imbalance.<br>  <br>  But:<br>  <br>  A. There are other factors affecting exchange rates: interest rates, attractiveness of foreign direct investments, perceived riskiness of the government or the economy, etc.<br>  <br>  B.

I just have to keep asking myself what I did to contribute to it happening... and usually I find that I had at least a small measure of responsibility in the issue, if I look at it long enough. And if someone really does me wrong, which is rare, nothing is more gratifying than exhibiting a few measures of mercy. People change right before my eyes.

y1xQ3Gppaa	I have had a similar dream. I was at the house where I grew up. In the back yard there was a greenbelt. I went over to a little wooded area where I used to play with my neighbors. There was a train going by and I saw my Grandma, who passed away a little over 4 years ago. She said good-bye and got on the train and left. I woke up crying too. <br>  I believe it was my Grandma's and God's way of telling me that she is ok. The train was a ride into Heaven. <br>  <br>  Honestly, the brain is a mystery. Scientists don't know why we have the dreams we do.<br>  But I know your Great Grandma is in Heaven, and then your Grandma will go, and then your parents and then you. But you WILL be re-united with them again. <br>  Although I'm sure your dream was scary, in a way it might have been nice to see your great grandmother again. Just remember that she's not far away and when you need comfort ask for her to be there and she will be. :)<br>  <br>  If you'd like to talk more, feel free to contact me at:<br>  liongatefilms@yahoo.com

You ever heard of his songs when he was in the band Public Enemy?|`|R2AYKVVlaa	Considering that it was feminists who threw themselves in front of Flavor Flav and other rappers in the 80's when some in power were attempting to censor them, I'm sure that there are feminists would be happy to campaign for them.  Being a huge rap fan myself, I can think of plenty I'd not mind seeing in office.  Dr. Dre is a fine man, and he has apologized for his earlier sexist lyrics (as have many of the rappers from the 80's, grateful as they were for the campaign led by feminist Sinead O'conner on their behalf)  He's also shown a passion for helping kids in the inner city.  Ludakris saved an entire village, by bringing in running water, food, building a school, etc.  Sean Combs is extremely active in raising money for poor kids to go to summer camps.  I could go on and on.<br>  <br>  That reminds me.  What exactly do you mens rights "activists" do besides write letters of protest over domestic violence campaigns that you find "offensive"?

I had heard that our bodies often wake up at a regular time if it is used to being fed at such a time.  I know it worked for me when I had to wake up earlier... I started having breakfast earlier in the day.  It may work for waking up later.  So try to eat later in the morning, and maybe you'll wake up later too.

CCf6Y7DIaa	modern theories suggest that dreams exist to fulfill unfulfilled desires. my guess is, you miss your time with your boyfriend (note that this is not a sign that you should get back with him, it's just your subconscious giving you what you miss).|`|vgHnnTxNaa	"Dreams are the road to the unconscious" -Freud<br>  <br>  In my personal opinion, dreams are the result of previous memories, daily activities, and mainly stress. Dreams sometimes can have deeper meanings but most of the time do not. Do not over analyze them.
4pkFJxNJaa	Don't worry it does not mean your gay as suggested previously. It also has NOTHING to do with sexuality. It is important that you realize that most signals in dreams are merely symbols representing another meaning. <br>  <br>  Lets start with the setting of the dream . <br>  <br>  Bathrooms, suggest that you have innate need for privacy, you may feel like you are not getting enough privacy in your living situation or someone may be making your life more public then you would like. <br>  <br>  A gym (Gymnasium) refers to the fact that you need to apply things (as in emotions or lessons) learned to real life. <br>  <br>  pants represent a role in a situation, for someone to pull on your pants suggest you feel like someone is trying to take a roll from you and you don't quite mind if they do. <br>  <br>  TO urinate (or use the restroom) in your dream again suggests the need for privacy. <br>  <br>  Now to the Penis, which inevitably seems to be the cause of much duress. Seeing a penis in a dream suggests power. <br>  <br>  While all buildings in your dream represent yourself, an elementary school could represent a need for guidance. <br>  <br>  All in all, it seems as if there is someone who you feel is taking power from you in real life (not necessarily the person in your dream) <br>  <br>  Since your dream suggests that you don't have to many issues with the person that is taking power from you, I'm going to take a leap and wonder if this dream is not referring to a parent or authoritative figure. Perhaps you feel someone has been dwelling a little to much into your private affairs.   Or maybe you have been disciplined for the behavior. WHatever the reasoning, your dreams are telling you it's time for you to let things out and make your feelings known, may I suggest not rushing in but having a sit down talk with the person.  I hope this was close and offered insight for you.|`|CCf6Y7DIaa	it means you're gay (assuming you're a male like your icon suggests) and horny and hot for this guy. also, you may be a 'bottom.' dreams exist to fulfill unfulfilled desires.

6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	Everybody's income is due to someone else spending, so when people save but no one borrows the money and spends it for investment or consumption, the total income in the country must fall. The theory behind the stimulus is that if the government borrowed the excess saved money and spends it, the total  income in the country will not fall as much, so it will reduce unemployment and make the recession shorter. <br>  <br>  We are bailing out the banks because most of the money they lost they owed to other people and   without them the money people save can not be borrowed. I do not know whether or not it will work, but if it does not we will be in big trouble.

YOGPspsgaa	No. You're good at things and you might not even realize it.  It's alright if things start off rocky, keep trying. You'll feel better at the end of the day knowing that you gave it your best instead of just quitting. Just keep at it. It's not just you, people have difficulties on lots of things but we keep trying because perhaps we will strengthen our weakness. I know I have ups and downs each day but time doesn't stop so I have to move on. <br>  <br>  If you're not feeling so great about yourself you need to talk to someone about it. Liven yourself up a bit more. Don't just focus on all the negative. If you're having some trouble on something get someone you know who is good at what you are having trouble with to help you. And try doing something you really enjoy to relieve some stress.<br>  <br>  Oh and just to throw in something random at an attempt to cheer you up:.... My class launched rockets up in the sky today!!

It is lousy.  It may be that you are depressed.  I know, taking drugs seems bad, but there are people that need antidepressants, and you'd be surprised to know how many do.  Do some research.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, think of this... Thomas Edison had to try hundreds of different substances before he found the right kind of stuff to make light bulbs light.  Sometimes it takes lots of effort to get what you want.  You will know what doesn't work, so it gets you closer to what does work.  People aren't usually lucky, they just tried enough times.  <br>  <br>  Also, do stuff that makes you happy.  Don't think about what other people would think or say.  Everyone has different ideas of what's good for hobbies.  I knew a high school senior who bought coloring books and colored them on breaks at her work.  Was she too old to color in books?  Some idiots would say so, but not me.  It made her happy, so color on!<br>  <br>  When you're insecure, you think everyone is looking at you and judging you, seeing how much you aren't like them.  Think about the people you want to be like.  Why do you like them?  They look well groomed, and will look you in the eye, and not look away.  You like what you see.  Well, model that.  Look people in the eye.  You are on equal ground.  It may shake you to your toes, but you will get better as you practice.  Life is reaching out.  And hey, everyone is imperfect.  Some just are able to laugh it off quicker.  <br>  <br>  I'm behind you here.  Good luck!|`|Y6IhTVW4aa	Stop thinking about it so hard. Its not because you were made that way.

CCf6Y7DIaa	lucky you. god, i remember dreams like that. just fantastic experiences that add color to my otherwise dreary existence :p<br>  <br>  cherish these dreams. you never know when they might go away.<br>  <br>  alternatively, you could have even more fun by writing down your dreams in a journal, for more in-depth personal interpretation, and to push the 'lucid dreaming' effect where you become consciously able to change aspects of a dream while still in the dream.<br>  <br>  when you suddenly realize, 'hey, i'm in a dream!' it actually feels mildly horrific at first because you don't know how to get out or what may come at you -until you try to will something into existence and then discover you have complete control over every detail in the environment. it is terrific fun. <br>  <br>  having a good memory for your dreams is the first step to achieving lucid dreaming, so you're already on the right steps. <br>  <br>  the key for me to push the experience into reality is to compare what my eyes see with what i know actually exists in the world. if some detail isn't right, i keep looking at the world and trying to probe my memories for differences with what i see until i realize -usually suddenly, with a start- that i'm in a dream. from then on, all you have to do is 'want' for something and it just happens. <br>  <br>  -an interesting thing i've discovered is that conjuring different moods for the same person is like conjuring different 'rooms.' it's rather strange, but you'll understand if you ever achieve this state. i guess that means our relationships and responses to different emotions, even for the same person, are compartmentalized like separate rooms in a house... as you can see, i really love my lucid dreams, and i could go on and on but i'll let you discover some of the fun :p<br>  <br>  note that your subconscious can still control many details in a lucid dream -anything which you don't personally will to existence is controlled by the subconscious and what it feels you need to see.<br>  <br>  of course, sometimes it's just as fun to just go along with a dream even when you know it's a dream. for instance, it's hard to beat a first person experience in 'quake 3,' complete with rocket jumping and respawning (and no pain, of course) :p|`|SvLOHmfbaa	Well, Rene Descartes was faced with this same problem years ago when he was asking himself whether or not one could tell if they were in reality or not and his answer was..."I think therefore I am, there fore I exist." To separate reality from dream all you have to do is think whether or not in the actual dream you can think or not. Because you cannot think in dreams but you can in reality.|`|OAJKrzVNaa	Thats happened to me before...

rM5Tofhwaa	Well, people make assumptions based on their perspective of the situation.  Young parents are not accepted in a lot of cultures, because it leads people to believe that they have had sexual intercourse "prematurely".  I quote this because people have been brainwashed to follow the masses, and premature sex, to the masses is adulthood, not the first signs of the ability to reproduce.  This is one case where the stereotype was actually constructive, because a lot of subcultures follow the idea that teen or early adult sex is "cool".  This stereotype is not just based upon false facts because the teenage mind is not completely developed and is therefore unable to cope with the dependency of a child.  as for reducing this stereotype, I don't think it is necessary because ignorant people tend to follow the masses.  these people are not Intelligent enough to decide that premature sex is dangerous, so there has to be the pressure put forth by large groups of people who don't approve.  This is just one case of stereotypical behavior that have a positive influence, but there are some that are just based on false facts and can only be ignored because people enjoy power in numbers and will try anything to achieve it.|`|NuXv6YLWaa	New question: How can we prove the stereotypes?|`|4pkFJxNJaa	I agree with the previous poster in that, it's not in the stereotype, that we should be disproving the one that exists, that in its self would steer people away from being judgmental. That's a toughy, but good luck to you!

Because that's not healthy.    You try to bite people?  You have weird "mind urges?"  <br>  <br>  You aren't a werewolf, because werewolves aren't real.  So either you can act like a normal kid and stop trying to make yourself artificially stick out, or you can't, and should get the help you need.|`|u5AMqHevaa	I recommend taking full advantage of this situation like Michael J.

Also, if you're really a werewolf and you have all these "dog-like" symptoms, I'm gunna go ahead and want you to check yourself for what we refer to as a "red rocket". It's when your....well...google it and you'll see. That's the only sure fire way to tell if you're a man-beast. Good luck.|`|uCr1uiIuaa	It's werewolf, not werewolve|`|RSr4XQ5iaa	Oh man. that's some serious stuff . I say. chain yourself up when the next full moon comes :)|`|tvlPZ5zeaa	You are not, there is no such thing. Get some sleep.|`|Qun4OXeLaa	You didn't say if you're a boy or a girl but your handle or nickname seems to be feminine.  On the other hand, the way you talk or write seems to indicate that you're a boy.<br>  <br>  1>Regarding full moons:  people and animals are sensitive to the full moon.  Lunar (moon) cycles seem to dictate certain things to our bodies.  Most people are so disoriented by city lights that they aren't in sync with lunar cycles anymore.  It looks like you're one of the few who are still in sync with nature.<br>  <br>  2>We all have sharp teeth that looks like fangs but some of us have have bigger fangs than others, just as some might have bigger molars than other.<br>  <br>  3 & 5>You're very, very observant.  Part of language and communications is observation.  People and, specially, dogs give off subtle cues about what they feel and think.  You're also very smart, that you're able to put all the cues you read from humans, or dogs, together and understand what it means.<br>  <br>  4>Meat is delicious.  It is full of proteins, vitamins and minerals that we need to survive.  It is also a compact form of food.  Since you're still in school, and your grammar and spelling seems to indicate that you're in your teens, I'd say it is natural for you to want to eat more because your body is growing and it needs more energy and building materials.<br>  <br>  6>The urges, bad temper and rages might be connected to you being a teen.  The teen years are often very confusing because of all the body changes that are happening.  This is on top of the hormonal changes that are happening.  Top this off with the fact that you're smarter and more observant, it is going to be a bumpy ride.<br>  <br>  My take: it doesn't matter if you're a werewolf or not.  Wolves follow only one leader, this means you take charge of your wolf side, not your wolf side taking charge of you.  Werewolves in movies lose control because they let their wolf side intimidate their human side into letting go of the leadership.  It doesn't matter how loud the wolf side growls, your human side must growl louder.  Remember, to make a loud growl, you must take a deep breath and growl from your diaphragm.<br>  <br>  Find time to play wolf games with the wolf side, with sports that work like hunting, for example football or basketball (pack hunting) or tennis or badminton (solo hunting).<br>  <br>  Find time to improve the human side, like socializing with your human pack.  Find to for reading books and magazines and newspapers.  The stronger your human side becomes, the more respect the wolf side will have for it.<br>  <br>  Keep your werewolf-ness a secret?  What for?  Make it an asset.  Give the wolf side a prey, a mental goal decided by the human side and let the wolf side chase it down.  Just choose your goals wisely.

X2nceNI4aa	i would explain to her that you noticed what she was eating on a daily basis was unhealthy for a person of any size (as she is probably worried about her weight) and explain that for your body to be healthy you have to better things for you and when you eat healthy foods like vegetables or whole grain or whatever, you can eat more and not have to worry about eating too much. I would try to say it in a very generalized way as not to bring up the weight issue and to say how it applies to everyone. Hope that helps.
KNXprBi2aa	Banks rely alot on investors but if they did what you suggested then - Hell Yeah.|`|JgFkmif9aa	If that were done, there would be no banks.

If they had done this the world would not be in a recession that hurts people a lot more than charities help. Companies should  do what they are paid to do, and  a banks business is the management of loans and risk.

Just hearing the news and people who know nothing of what their even saying, is enough to put any person in bad space. To want to better yourself is the correct way of seeing the glass half full.

BhumxInEaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mo...</a><br>  <br>  1. The immediate trigger was the large number of mortgage defaults when the interest rates went up and people with variable rate mortgages could no longer afford their mortgage payments.<br>  <br>  2. One reason so many people couldn't afford the increased payments was that the mortgage lenders were eager to lend money, even to people who were not good credit risks - people who had no reserves.<br>  <br>  Another reason was that housing prices were rising so much faster than incomes, that even people with good jobs and good incomes had to take out mortgages that were much larger than was prudent.<br>  <br>  These two were connected because one reason housing prices went up is that mortgages were easy to get, so demand for houses was high.<br>  <br>  3. The reason mortgage lenders were eager to lend, even to people with poor credit ratings is that they no longer held the risk.<br>  <br>  In the old days, when a bank lent a mortgage, the bank would foreclose if the payments weren't made. This cost the bank a great deal, so banks were careful about who they lent money to.<br>  <br>  Once banks and other mortgage lenders could sell their mortgages as "mortgage backed securities" to other investors, the original lenders didn't lose when the borrower failed to pay - the holder of the mortgage backed security was the loser. And since the lenders got paid a commission for each mortgage they sold, it was in their interest to sell as many mortgages as they could.<br>  <br>  4. One reason people were willing to buy mortgage backed securities is that the security rating agencies (Standard and Poors, Moody's, etc.) <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating_agency" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rati...</a><br>  gave them ratings that said they were as safe as U.S. Treasury bonds (which was clearly not the case)<br>  <br>  5. One reason people were willing to take out so many mortgages is that interest rates were at historic lows for a long time. Even after the Federal Reserve saw that their low interest rates were causing a housing bubble, they chose not to do anything about it and continued to delay raising the interest rates.<br>  <br>  That was the start. Since then, the situation has snowballed. Holders of mortgage backed securities lost a bundle so they couldn't pay their debts; every got scared, not knowing who was still solvent and who was really broke; etc.

ybxpSqD2aa	I would say that he is going about this all wrong.  If he is constantly going out with women that he’s comfortable with then he’ll never feel comfortable with the women he’s attracted to.  He needs to get over this fear and the best way to do that is by simply talking to them.  Have no expectations except that she will start talking to you as well and if she doesn’t then pretend it’s a video game, you just got killed, reset the game and start over. (I presume we’re talking about you here.) You need to be very calm and not at all nervous when you talk to her because if you are nervous she will feel it but that should be easy because you have NO expectations, right?  As you become comfortable just talking about absolutely nothing with increasingly pretty women, once the nervous jitters have gone then you can start thinking about asking someone out on a date.|`|oFR4yvHaaa	It's definitely the fastest way to "get in the game". <br>  <br>  I've done it many times when I was "rusty" and needed to warm up again. <br>  <br>  DO IT (and who cares what anyone thinks?)|`|iHKJsyfTaa	Can't always jump right into a Corvette, sometimes you have to drive that Cavalier or Nova for a while first.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	People of both genders do this, but in different ways.

Your brain sends out the mood chemicals, maybe too much at one time. Then  the brain's neurons don't connect. Then they are not able to process the proper thought patterns. Chemical overload, & no connection makes it hard to come out of it for days. <br>  <br>  When you are in your 'up' mood, you could have insomnia, big time! But at the same time, while you are not sleeping, up could get loads <br>  of homework done.<br>  <br>  When you are in your 'down' mood, you could literally sleep for 3 days straight. <br>  When you talk to your college counselor about this, ask if he or she knows of any natural supplements you could take to try to balance everything out.
cwsYM2F4aa	I understand your sympathy for the older children and I agree.  However, there is much more to the issue that you are overlooking.<br>  <br>  I don't think you really understand the severity of the problems many of these children have.  I used to license and supervise foster homes so I've seen them first hand.<br>  <br>  It's not the child's fault, of course.  It's just what happens from living in an abusive and/or horribly neglectful environment during their formative years.  <br>  <br>  However, I've seen horrible things happen to good families who are just trying to give these children a fresh start and a good life.  I've seen children who have tried to start their foster homes on fire, made false allegations of being hit by their foster parents leading to police investigations and ruined reputations, children who have molested the family's younger biological children, children who have killed beloved family pets, and I've heard of (none of the children I worked with, thank goodness) a child a county away who killed his adoptive parents.  <br>  <br>  There are many people who do not want to risk bringing any of this into their lives.  I don't condemn them for that.  It's a huge responsibility.  Anyone who is considering fostering or adopting children in the state system needs to know the risks and they need to have extensive training in how to deal with all of these children's issues.  It takes a very special kind of person to work effectively with these children, and believe me when I tell you that it takes a whole lot more than just love. They are going to have to be thick-skinned and have a whole slew of behavioral management training and experience in order to be an effective parent to these children.  <br>  <br>  Many people have thought "these children just need love!  I will give them love and a home!"  While their intentions are good, most of them end up failing and giving the children back to the state in the end after the honeymoon period is over and the behavioral problems start to pop up.  And that causes more emotional damage to the child than never having taken them in in the first place.  Most of these parents have no idea what they are getting into and they are not prepared.  They don't realize the amount of time and work they will have to put in.  And they don't realize these kids usually have deep emotional and behavioral issues that they will need to deal with everyday.<br>  <br>  I say if they are like the lady that only wanted a newborn, don't let them anywhere near these older kids.  Only people who have the special gift of knowing how and being trained to really nurture and help these children should have the privilege of caring for them.  Those are the types of parents these kids really need, not the people with delusions of butterflies and rainbows and the "just love them enough and they will be fine" mentality.  That is a recipe for disaster.|`|svOneExjaa	It was an opinion of one female, not everyone's reason for adopting a child. In my opinion, when making a decision on bringing a new child in their family, most people crave to go through every step of this baby's development together. They yearn to build earliest memories together; to bond with a baby is so much easier than to do the same with an older child. People tend to feel very protective of their children's memories, when those precious moments include them. Just a thought.|`|NYU37jfGaa	I would assume that the reason most people prefer to adopt newborn babies is that they can then raise the child from the beginning and therefore feel more as if the child is actually theirs rather than someone else's.<br>  <br>  Adopting an older child is obviously going to be more difficult, and is probably less appealing to prospective adopters. There doesn't seem to me to be anything particularly surprising about this.  I would imagine that older children are more likely to be fostered rather than adopted.<br>  <br>  I do recall reading about a case a few years ago in the UK where the foster parents of a girl wanted to adopt her, but she didn't want to be a dopted, because, although she was fond of her foster parents, she wished to retain a link to her natural mother.  So her foster parents rejected her.  I thought that was terribly cruel.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Of course it's true. That's the main reason people want newborns.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I can understand it, but it still makes me sad. And the newborn trade in the USA, which is effectively what it is, is just creepy. Adoption is rare here in Australia and managed very differently. The fact is, abandoned children often do have a lot of issues, and often it takes extra time and money to overcome them and they have to put up with stuff like the foster child setting their house on fire or whatever. It can take more than just a stable and loving family to stop a criminal child from being like that. I get where they're coming from, but I do think foster care adoption is better than newborn adoption.<br>  <br>  Also, a lot of people just want a baby. We're wired to like the baby stage...and I think a lot of people don't actually want a child, they want a baby. (Of course the baby grows up, but they're not thinking of that.) They also want to think of the child as theirs, not as second parents while the child remembers the first.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|x5MYW2LPaa	No, for me it would definitely have more to do with would they want to find their 'real' parents.

But if they were your own child then suddenly one day they wanted to find their 'real' mum and dad that would be heartbreaking.|`|1d6wXCleaa	No, i'd rather adopt a child than a baby, although adopting a baby would be easier in the long run, i think adopting a child would be more rewarding.<br>  Think about it, you could change the life of a child who is unstable etc.<br>  The achievement of that is far greater i think.|`|AA10370987	I'm not surprised at all.

I stayed in several homes up until adolescence and was introduced to things that I never saw at my home. (horrible things) Its really unfortunate that it is like this.  <br>  <br>  My mother did foster care as well before she passed away and there were always kids coming and going, older ones especially because they were harder  to have in the home.  (rebellious etc) and the ones she wanted to keep they wouldnt let her because they were going back to stay with a grandmother or something.  There is always something.|`|AA11429880	I'm not interested in kids period, but I would have to agree that if I were, I would be more interested in a baby.  People usually don't adopt to save the world, they adopt because they want a kid.  And they want a well-adjusted kid, not one that is already messed up.<br>  <br>  For the questions under your additional details:  Yes I would hold those children responsible for their actions. Yes I would do the same after they were adults.  They can be blamed for their crimes because they chose to commit them.  A sad childhood does not excuse someone from being a criminal.  There is such a thing as personal accountability.|`|DBg0yFSYaa	You're decided these people are selfish based on made up facts. Like, you seem to be assuming that abandoned children become serial killers. Also that these potential adoptive parents want an infant so that they have a "fresh start". It could also be that the idea of having children usually starts with a baby. I don't think someone who is opening up their home and hearts to a child that is not biologically theirs needs to defend what they opt for. Imagine if someone who did not want a child known to have problems felt obligated to take one. Would that be good for the child? No, probably not. Besides, anyone who doesn't "want" to deal with that probably doesn't have the skills to deal with it. People who adopt ANY child and raise it as their own are heroes in my book.|`|c77cjTOeaa	"An estimated 15 million American children are diagnosed with a mental disorder, but only about a quarter of them are getting appropriate treatment... Many more children are at risk of developing behavioral disorders. And the problem is only going to get worse unless the health care system changes how it delivers services, according to a task force of the American Psychological Association.<br>  <br>  This is especially true for low-income youth, for youth in the juvenile justice and child welfare systems, ethnic minority youth, and those with drug/alcohol problems."  The task force concluded that evidence-based practice is essential for addressing the needs of children and adolescents with myriad mental health problems."<br>  <br>  Their needs are being ignored and without treatment they will get worse, not better.

They could be carrying genetic tendencies towards certain undesirable behaviors that they could have inherited from their biological parents. I recall reading the story of a 7-year-old girl who was raped and killed in a Nevada casino in the late 1990s while her father was gambling. She was not being supervised and allowed to run loose. Finally, she was lured into a restroom where she was raped and murdered. It turned out that the young man who did it had been adopted at birth. His natural father had been a convicted rapist. This story caused a lot of controversy at the time because the man's friend, who acted as lookout, didn't report the crime and showed no remorse or concern. They were both identified from surveillance tapes by some of their friends.|`|FUIBscKGaa	You are a sockpuppet and you are assuming.

Researcher in this area are just beginning to recognise that these parents may be sparing the child potential harm (physical and otherwise).  It turns out that although many abortions go perfectly, a large number simply don't work out no matter how hard the adoptive parents try.<br>  <br>  Rather than go into a lengthy discussion, please allow me to refer you to Joyce Sterkel and The Project for Kids Ranch where so many of these troubled children are cared for until they become more comfortable with this difficult adjustment.  It turns out that adoption is far more complex than we initially understood and parents who are having trouble with a child whom they have adopted should not have to endure being stigmatized because we now see that it's not all that infrequent that these things don't work out.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Yes, people really think like that. Which is why there are so many older kids languishing in the foster care system. It's really a shame. But there are some people out there who are more than happy to help an older child, and IMO these families are heroes. <br>  <br>  As for this: <br>  "What about the crimes they commit after they are legal adults?<br>  <br>  If you said yes, how can they be blamed for their crimes if no one ever stepped in to help them?"<br>  <br>  Having a crap childhood is awful, and it damages people. But they are still responsible for their actions as adults. They still know that it's wrong to boost cars, to deal drugs, to steal, to kill, to abuse, to rape. They know they shouldn't and they do it anyway. Using a bad childhood as an excuse for being a criminal is a cop-out.

The fact that they are a former friend suggests trying to understand someone but without having enough information to 'translate' what they said, or did, into something that makes sense to you.<br>  <br>  For example, if your friendship was strong but suddenly dissolved, and you haven't had any meaningful friendships since, the miscommunication is related to your inability to understand what happened. You know something did happen (the result) but you don't know how it happened or what caused it (the process.)

If so there were a lot of interest feminist discussions concerning the treatment of women and mental health.

However during world war one, male solders returned from the battle fields with symptoms of 'hysteria'.

adQWVOeAaa	the term anthropology comes from the greek word "anthropos" which literally translates to "man". so, Anthropology is the study of man. Basically it is a cross-cultural study that looks at humans past, present, and future. There are four main subfields of Anthropology: cultural, physical/biological, archaeology, and linguistic. <br>  <br>  As for jobs in the future, it really is a subject that if you want to get far into it, graduate school is almost a guaranteed necessity. After that, however, you can apply what you learn to basically anything and everything. <br>  <br>  My suggestion to you would be to do some internet searches on Anthropology to get a better feel for what YOU may get out of it. <br>  <br>  One expanding field, and the one I hope to get into, is business/corporate Anthropology, which is basically applying the skills I learn as an anthropologist to the business and corporate world.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps! <br>  and good luck with the future of your education and beyond!|`|ol8NAyevaa	Hey there,<br>  <br>  I am a 4th year anthropology major at the University of Western Ontario, in London, Ontario, Canada.<br>  <br>  I can tell you a little bit about what anthropolgists do and what we study.<br>  <br>  In its simplest form, anthropology is the study of culture; what we do and how we do it, and why we do it. It is the study of people and their ways of life.<br>  <br>  There are many forms of anthropology that we study that are broken down even further; linguistics (the study of language), bio-archaeological (study of fossils), and social anthropology (customs, traditions, norms). <br>  <br>  We go from studying bones of the past to the future of societies, a rather broad study.<br>  <br>  What can you do in the future?<br>  - you can do fieldwork, fossil extractions or culture studies.<br>  - teach at a highschool or university level.<br>  - as well as having a degree can get you any job you desire, it teaches you how to deal with people, how to observe, and teaches you a respect for the world.<br>  <br>  Indiana Jones is an anthropologist, and I hope you know who he is. <br>  Pretty great career if you ask me.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped you.

4pkFJxNJaa	While I really cannot go into too much detail without more information I can give you small insight from what you have written. <br>   <br>  First off. Never ever look at the big picture of a dream, you will simply be baffled and confused to why and what genocide has to do with school or for some people they wonder why they were wearing flowers in their hair and means underwear.. Dreams are signals and are very much keys to unlocking that which is in our underlying emotions, It is VERY important to take each piece and analyze it thoroughly. Genocide...That's many people, a crowd. <br>  <br>  Look up the word crowd,  <br>  <br>   In this case the crowd is scared and possibly riotous  this suggests that you are concerned or worried about a situation in waking life. <br>  <br>  A bomb suggests that you are going theough some turmoil that may be explosive in form this could be in waking life or even within yourself, such as emotions that make you feel like your going to explode, like extreme anger. <br>  <br>  Feeling trapped in a dream suggest that you are feeling the same way in life. Whether it be school, relationships or inside. <br>  <br>  I hope this little bit helps<br>  <br>  ASk yourself other questions about your dream like, what were the main colors of the dream, was the sky extremly blue, or were the walls  bright orange? Whatever it was note it and write it down, what kind of game was it? Did anything else stand out? <br>  <br>  Then go to dreammoods.com and look up the individual items, dreammoods does not have all the answers, sometimes you have to just think about a representation and how it could apply in other aspects of your life.|`|Zzin0jCBaa	you may have a crush on hitler lol...just kiddin.

UXDNMtnaaa	i used to be in the same situation...my ex is an alcoholic. he got abusive. at one point, he pushed me into a wall with his body, another time he was drunk and went to kick me while i was walking away with a newborn in my arms. it ended up to be more of a push, but it made me fall, but i didnt let go of my baby. i hate to admit it, but when i fell, i actually wet myself...and i was 26 at the time. the last straw was when he was drunk, pushed me out of a dining room chair and i hit my head on the tile, then while i was down he kicked me and hit me, then pulled me by my hair about 10 feet, then walked away as if nothing happened. i went to another room to call the police, and when they showed up i learned he had a gun loaded. he doesnt remember any of this, or so he says. after that i left him for good. if ur husband doesnt want to get help for his alcohol, leave. it will only get worse. i thought my situation would get better, but it just gets worse. i could have been shot that night had i just ignored it, then my 2 kids would be left with an abusive father. a few drinks will calm him down, but drinking as much as he did had the opposite effect. i feel for u...and it worries me that u could end up in the same situation as me. it's scary to confront or even leave someone like that, but in the long run, it's the best thing. trust me, unless he seeks help for this, it will NOT get better. i hope u take my story into consideration.  feel free to email me if u need any help or advice...best of luck!!!!|`|fa5c4f373a8de64cffa0f9041aaa803aaa	If your husband hits you or is verbally abusive it's time to leave.

It's just a temporary mind-numbing agent, and by mind-numbing, one's rationale may not be reached when in anger.<br>  <br>  Anger is somehow a male's way of attempting to get the point across or desperately grasping for dominance, which is unnecessary in the social context where people do just fine with respecting each other. Anger can be a deliberate way to put things in control, but on the contrary, uncontrolled anger comes from weak, conceled self. And to cover that flaw, he's redirecting the blame unto others.<br>  <br>  Now I don't want to take this theory against him. I want you to acknowledge and understand why he is angry. Be strong and don't reciprocate his anger with anger, he'll feel more threatened and more abuse will ensue. Don't submit or fear him also because he may feel guilty and drive himself towards more self-blame. And distancing away ("rejecting him") will only make matters worse.<br>  <br>  What you can do, if it hasn't gone too far, is to be strong and oblivious to his anger, speak amicably with calm, collected tone and ask what is the message he want to get across in his anger. And again, calmly speak your reasons if you can or cannot follow his demands. Finding his own fits of tantrums ineffective maybe the way towards redemption, just keep repeating "you don't have to be angry, just tell me what's the matter" (don't go over his shouts, listen until he finish the sentence and try it)<br>  <br>  In case it worsens, you're free to seek more professional help or a better mediator to help him understand himself. Do defend yourself for the worst of situations, don't play nice if you cannot stand it yourself.

This is more true when economy is booming but during a recession saving increase and private spending falls so there is less crowing out so less opportunity costs from government borrowing.

This is a very interesting and ethically debate. Some mental health professional believe it is inappropriate to diagnose thoses under the age of 18 because 'they are still in the developmental stages and psychiatric symptoms that suggest a 'disorder' can be a result of this'. However there are doctors who do believe early diagnostics and treatment is appropriate. There would be plenty of interesting arguments and case studies from both sides.<br>  <br>  ...also....<br>  <br>  A topic that is very relevant to teenages is how the media portrays mental illness. In praticular, when a celebrity is depicted as 'mental ill' how does this change our perception of the illness? Does the illness then became celebrity?

7j9MfenOaa	I've been dealing with nightmares a lot too.  You can't prevent dreaming.  It stinks, but I took a psychology class and learned that, people who don't dream become mentally unstable and can actually die from it.  You have to dream.  It's your brain's way of sorting out your days and putting everything into an order it can tolerate.<br>  <br>  I learned a few tricks.  First, don't eat anything heavy or anything spicey within about four hours of bedtime.  If you have to eat, opt for something light like a salad or fruit.  Next, many people swear by a cup of warm milk.  I can't stand the stuff, but if I mix in just a bit of hot cocoa mix or NesQuick, I can.  <br>  <br>  Meditation, yoga, or guided relaxation exercises work wonders too!  I do this about twenty minutes before bed now.  I light a few candles, burn my favorite incense (usually vanilla, patchoulli, or dragons blood...but ylang ylang, jasmine, or lilac work as good or better, if you prefer those scents), and play music that I find soothing...usually Enya or Celtic type songs.  Concentrate on relaxing and breathing...think of the things you would like to dream about...<br>  <br>  Sometimes it takes a few nights, but it's been helping me tremendously.  Hope this helps!|`|IBnRpVCpaa	No. Dreams are naturally occurring in the sleep cycle, during the REM stage. There is no way to prevent them. Some people will tell you that they don't dream, but the truth is that they never remember their dreams because they are being waken up by a loud alarm instead of slowly coming out of sleep. However, you can train yourself rather easily to have lucid dreams. This is when you become aware in your dream that you are asleep and dreaming, and you then either have complete control of the dream, or you wake yourself up. There are lots of websites about how to teach yourself to lucid dream, but the main thing is to tell yourself you will before you go to bed. The subconscious is very easily influenced. You can also try telling yourself that you will have very good dreams, or that if you start to have a bad dream, you will wake yourself up. Another thing my mom used to tell me as a little girl was to pretend that there's a big remote in your mind, and if you Start conjuring up bad images, or start to have a bad dream, just click to another channel and start dreaming more pleasantly.|`|6cd0dede1cb5b94c9817d6ec157367bcaa	The first part of my answer will probably sound very silly to you, but I find that it works for me.<br>  <br>  1. Try falling asleep to soothing music--it could be classical, country, whatever makes you tick, and whatever you enjoy listening to. It relaxes you and doesn't require a lot of thought as your go to sleep.<br>  <br>  2. Try relaxation exercises before you head to bed- you can find them online, in books, in articles, etc. It can be yoga, or for some, simply stretching. Just relax.<br>  <br>  Basically, do anything before bed that's going to help you relax and get the bad stuff from your day out of your head.<br>  <br>  If the dreams persist and they are truly troubling, consider seeing a therapist. Some dreams are a genuine side effect of an emotional circumstance that your mind doesn't know how to deal with, and even talking through it with someone who knows what they're doing can help.|`|MKx1e0hiaa	relaxing is not a good idea if your thinking about what troubles you. I cant say that im an expert but ive had repetative nightmares in the past. Whenever i would relax, whatever was troubling me would pop into my head, and then i would the same damn nightmare again. <br>  <br>  So me beng the wimp i am i developed some ways to counter this:<br>  <br>  - watching a funny show right befor i go to bed, sitcoms being prefferable because they usually dont go into anything to deep.<br>  <br>  - you can get pills from your doctor that force you to have a deep sleep with no interuptions by dreams, you go to sleep then wake up, thats it<br>  <br>  - try controlling your dreams, try shifting the dreams to different ones or changing the outcome<br>  for example: When dreaming about scary monsters in the closet, influence the dream to were you are a magical wizard that can fly away.<br>  <br>  -drink something warm befor going to bed, preferably warm milk, i forgot the reason why but it really helps<br>  <br>  i would reccomend the pills for you.

K2h6M1xqaa	You have a great opportunity here!<br>  <br>  When you feel the emotions of neediness coming on, what you do is look inside yourself to find their roots.  Try to figure out what the root cause of those feelings are.<br>  <br>  If you were a single child, or ignored a lot as a kid, or given ALL the attention, or any number of combinations, your ego may feel afraid of being abandoned or feels that it naturally deserves all the 'love'.<br>  <br>  When you isolate what is going on, don't judge it, just observe it without saying, "This is Bad".  Just look at it for a while and see how it 'moves' within you.<br>  <br>  Just by doing this, by seeing what it is and how it works gives you a lot of control.  It's automatic.

Well, I think that people are just kind evolving that way too, and, along with an up in social acceptance of near androgyny- (women aren't only wearing skirts and dresses, trendy mens clothing is a little more feminine) I thinks its a sign that society is not as hung up on it as they used to be.

Give me a break.|`|un0C52G8aa	Andrea Yates? Nobody has ever denied that she drowned her children because it's obvious she did. I guess some people believe that the fact that she went to a mental institution instead of jail must mean her crimes were covered up. She belongs in a mental institution because she did have a history of mental illness. She often engaged in disturbing and bizarre behavior such as rarely talking, barely eating, and staring off into space for long periods of time. Even the family dog seemed to be afraid of her.

5JUeTOzmaa	The best answer I found for the cause of a recession is that there are limits to what can be produced or who can buy.<br>  <br>  For example, the housing crisis is caused basically because there was no one else to lend to.  The beanie babies phenomenon was ended by the saturation of too many beanie babies.  Saturation is when whoever is going to buy has already purchased.  The same effect is starting to slow the U.S. auto market.  That's one reason electric cars are important, to give the market something different to buy.<br>  <br>  Money is created only when more goods and services are created.  The fact is that the United States consumes 1/3 of everything produced in the entire world, so when we have consumed enough and can't purchase anymore the world slows down.<br>  <br>  The other problem that underlies all of this is credit.  Overused credit causes personal recession in our own lives.  We see the example of a new credit card to someone who doesn't know how to use it.  The balance is zero so they charge whatever they want.  After a time the credit card is maxed out so they are forced to live a more conservative lifestyle until there is room to splurge on the credit card.  This is also how a recession works, basically, we maxed out our ability to buy and if enough of us act this way we fall into a recession.  That's why they talk of savings rates and public debt.<br>  <br>  Free stuff causes problems as well.  If food were free at a restaurant, people would eat as much as wanted.  If it were the only restaurant and everyone needed to eat and the food ran out, the rest of the people waiting for their turn outside would be sent away with nothing.  This is the basic problem in all communist/ socialistic societies.  A central government can't in reality plan for an entire country, there in lies the genius of free enterprise.  In capitalism that restaurant can be a chain of restaurants where they see a need.  They order as much food as they can project without governments limiting their orders.  The company takes a hit if they order too little or too less not the entire country.  That would be great to see a committee trying to come up with how many beanie babies their population is going to buy!  If they get it wrong too many times and the country suffers.  If a free enterprise restaurant starts to run out of food they can raise prices so as to keep the people in front of the line from hogging out.  This analogy has its flaws, but the idea of money is to give you a way to actually budget when needed.  Indulgence is not a sound economic term.|`|JgFkmif9aa	I think you are a bit confused on what money is.  Money is only valuable to us because we can trade it for something else of valuable.  So, it's not money that measures a person's wealth, its what they have produced.  Money is just the easiest way of measuring this because it can be exchanged for anything.  Creating a new currency would not change at all what we have as a society or what we can make.<br>  <br>  As for why everything isn't free: think how much work goes into making all the things you own and use.  It has to be designed, created, transported, and sold to you.  No one would ever do all of this if they weren't getting paid.|`|5Snex2peaa	Our nitwit politicians and educators did not make accounting mandatory in the schools 40 years ago.<br>  <br>  The American people have been going into debt for garbage designed to become obsolete and the economics profession has been ignoring the depreciation of the garbage.

Now it is a highly glorified profession. You can't say that if you earn a lot of money, then you're already successful.<br>  <br>  With this, how happy and contented you are determine how great your success is.|`|AA11524272	Good question. Star for you.<br>  <br>  My first thought is: it depends.<br>  <br>  In western countries many people measure success in terms of money and wealth. If you are a "successful" "whatever" (artist, doctor, business man or woman) they expect you to become rich and to make tons and tons of money. You can be the best doctor or the best singer, yet if you don't make money or if you don't make other people make money with whatever you do, you may be seen as unsuccessful. This, unfortunately, is not the way I measure success.<br>  <br>  I think in the end you have to come up with you own definition of success. For many women, for example, to be successful means to get married and have children. For some other women, to be successful means to climb up to top executive jobs in a company. For some other women to be successful means to earn degrees from college or universities. It all depends on what you believe and what makes you happy.<br>  <br>  For men, successful may be measured in terms of physical things, like cars, houses or material possessions. The more you have or the bigger your possessions are the more "successful" you are. <br>  <br>  In some countries, even the physical characteristics of a man's woman may be part of the measure of success. If you are a man and you have a woman that meets the criteria of beauty perfection then you may be seen as a successful man. Just another stupid way to measure success.<br>  <br>  I think the basic success is measured by how happy you feel about whatever you do. You set the goal. If having a basic life with no big cars or big houses makes you happy then you are a successful person. You don't need to have big cars or houses to be successful. Even little things like having a pet or finishing reading a big book may be seen as success. <br>  <br>  In the end it all comes down to what you consider to be challenges and what you consider to be success. In my case for example, open heights scare me, so I bungee jumped one day and I felt real good about that, so that was a successful thing in my life to have overcome that fear.<br>  <br>  Money and fame are important to some people, but succeeding in life doesn't necessarily mean you have to be rich or famous. As long as your are happy you are successful. <br>  <br>  Regards!

I does sound like not all the responses were sexual or romantic requests but I still think she would have been subject to these despite her looks. <br>  <br>  I do wonder if she was less attractive then perhaps the public would have a different opinion on why she is motivated to do this project. Its possible she may be taken less seriously or stereotyped as lonely and desperate....or being attractive is she then labeled as 'attention seeking'? This also depends on how the media chooses to handle their articles and if they decided to play off her looks.<br>  <br>  Interesting factors that would change the results (or be interesting to cross reference with her current results) would be:<br>  <br>  Her nationality; how other cultures would respond to this would differ greatly as the social roles of women are more conservative in some countries. <br>  <br>  If she was a male; I think the issue of 'will they be exploited for sex?' is less of a public concern (but still a real issue). There endeavour would likely be seen as more playful, most interestingly, the male would be seen as the one in control. In the same experiment (i'm tipping) the female's sense of control is in question, her acts can be reviewed as subservient.<br>  <br>  Her age; if she was under 18 then this would generate a lot of legal concern. If she was over sixty then this would impact on how her offer is received.<br>  <br>  Other alternatives could be; If she called for people to help her do whatever she asked (inverted the idea), if she was wearing a uniform (creates order or a persona), if she arrived in a large box or wearing an expiry tag (she could be seen as an object or consumable).<br>  <br>  Thank you for asking this question I'm a Fine Art student and have a special interest in performance art.

The biggest danger of this one world regime is the implanting of a chip, in the hand, for keeping track of individuals. No one will be able to buy, sell, bank, work, travel etc.. This chip, designed by Verichip, is already in use. The introduction of it seems quite innocent fooling the world population for its real purpose.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.verichipcorp.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.verichipcorp.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ridingthebeast.com/articles/verichip-implant/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ridingthebeast.com/articles/v...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pantagraph.com/articles/2007/03/18/opinion/letters/124336.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.pantagraph.com/articles/2007/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.channelingreality.com/NAU/REAL_ID.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelingreality.com/NAU/REA...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://current.com/items/89201785/verichip_and_remote_controlled_societies.htm" rel="nofollow">http://current.com/items/89201785/verich...</a>

But I don't see life as hard.  It's a challenge at times, and it's a carnival at other times.  Most of the time it's somewhere in between.  I fill my life with as much joy as I can, and I buckle down to get through the rough stuff.  And I have seen my share, maybe more than my share, of difficulties.  But I get through them and get to the other side so I can enjoy the good stuff again.

You still have to live with some sort of restriction on you anywhere you go. Even in 'heaven' there are people more famous, more active, more attractive, more spiritual, etc etc etc, so dying doesn't really take you away from that.<br>  <br>  So maybe you won't develop a cure for cancer or date a Playboy model. The question then becomes: what would you do for the rest of your life, if you could, that would make you not care about the rest of the world? Depression really is all about caring to much about the world at large, which means the only way to combat that is to do the thing that would make you not care.<br>  <br>  This isn't a question about college or family or friends or anything: it's a question about doing your own thing.

4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Oh, yeah, Kitty... that helped!  LOL!  But it is accurate.<br>  <br>  The action potential describes the electrical activity inside a neuron.  When chemicals from previous neurons adequately stimulate your particular neuron, the action potential is triggered.  We say that the neuron "fires."  Think of how a gun works.  When you put enough effort into pulling the trigger to a certain point, the gun will fire.  There has to be a threshold reached before it'll fire, the gun will fire in only one direction, and the action is "all or nothing" (it either fires full force or it doesn't fire).  All three of those p[rinciples are also true of the action potential.  Once the action potential is triggered, an electrical charge blasts down the length of the axon, triggering the release of chemicals at the synaptic bouton, across the synapse, triggering the next bunch of neurons to fire.  And the process repeats itself.  This is how neurons communicate, allowing the brain to direct the body, emotions to accompany behaviors, etc.  It's an amazing process!|`|5b69b0aee2e0929afbcd2166a8e14474aa	here you are hun<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_pote...</a>

0bYcYz2jaa	Women should take more time when finding doctors and facilities available to them.  This will help keep them from having too many problems with their medical care.  Universal healthcare is not the answer though.  This will just make health care less available because we will have to go to the government to ask to have something done and they will decide where and to who we will be allowed to go.  It's hard enough to get my tax refund!  How are they going to streamline medicine?|`|NYU37jfGaa	You need to get yourselves a decent health service sorted out.
oVeGMNsLaa	I wrote this more as an explanation of why men like lesbian porn, but I think it still applies:<br>  <br>  Several reasons:<br>  <br>  1) A lot of straight men just don't like looking at men, which is something you have to do when you watch straight porn. For guys who get turned off at the sight of naked men and male body parts (other than their own, that is), lesbian porn easily fixes the problem.<br>  <br>  2) If one girl is good, two is better! Or at least, that's what a lot of men believe.<br>  <br>  3) It lets men in on a world they don't otherwise get to see. What we don't know is mysterious and exotic, and many men fantasize and imagine- what exactly DO lesbians get up to together? A lot of people can't even conceive of sex without a penis, so they're obviously curious and it's really hot to watch and get that voyeuristic feel of peeking into the bedroom's into which they would otherwise not be allowed entry.<br>  <br>  4) Much of the mainstream, girl-on-girl porn produced by men for men to consume, is very soft, playful, and gentle. For men who get turned off by rougher boy/girl scenes, lesbian porn is perfect.<br>  <br>  5) Lots of female pornstars openly admit that they prefer doing girl/girl scenes- they are with another woman, so there isn't an unequal power dynamic, and it's less stressful- it's just two girls having fun. Lots of time this communicates itself onscreen, so you get more real orgasms in lesbian porn (although there is still so much faking), and what looks like genuine enjoyment instead of acting the way there can be in boy/girl scenes. Men (and women) tend to enjoy watching happy pornstars.<br>  <br>  6) It's taboo. Two girls together is still somewhat taboo and "rare", so that adds in even more heat and sexiness.<br>  <br>  7) Somewhat related to #3, there are some men who watch it from that viewpoint, but more mean-spirited and vengeful. These are the guys who have been spurned by lesbians or bisexual women, and watch it feeling vindicated that they get to see lesbians (the same reason, for example, that many men like "Girls Gone Wild" instead of more hardcore fare- it lets them vicariously 'get with' all the young girls who rejected them back in high school).<br>  <br>  8) Somewhat related to #5 but a little different- a lot of men believe that women can better please a woman (because they have vaginas so they know what others like), and they feel because of this, they can watch hotter, better pleasuring in lesbian porn than straight porn.<br>  <br>  9) When's the last time you saw extended cunnilingus in a straight porn video? Exactly. If you like seeing the vagina being lovingly lavished, lesbian porn is the place to go.<br>  <br>  10) Men are programmed to think it's hot. We always seem to forget that the media has a large part to play in what we think is sexy, and they definitely promote girl-on-girl as something sexually desirable.<br>  <br>  11) It's "innocent". Oddly enough, a lot of men who watch porn feel disdainful for girls who seem "skanky" or like "sluts" for being in porn and sleeping with so many men. They want to see girls who aren't jaded and experienced, and lesbian porn harkens back to that for them- images that inundate our culture (young girls having sleepovers and practicing kissing and whatnot). Two girls together is often portrayed by porn as "innocent", "exploratory", and so on.<br>  <br>  12) We all want what we can't have. Men can't, by definition, have lesbians. Hence it becomes even hotter.<br>  <br>  There are probably more reasons, but this is a lot of it.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Since most Guys are "visual" creatures, I guess we're just inclined to think that "two girls are better than one" -on occasion... And that WE don't always have to be in the "mix"- to enjoy the Show !  :)|`|AA11589988	It's educational. Women know how to please other women.|`|XU1aTqQ8aa	I guess the lack of a guy makes it hotter...|`|ZLLfbKAQaa	You are wise beyond you're years young man.<br>  <br>  Edit @ Maxi R. -  You say people project their sexuality on others, and then in the quesiton you say straight men don't fantasize about the same-sex which I agree with, but straight women do.  Seems like you're projecting sexuality on them.  Look at RoVales answer, she is a straight woman and thinks it's gross and says most women feel the same way.  I beleive her more than you because she is a woman and knows more about women.  So that's silly of you.|`|ZYp1AEspaa	You don't really look at porn and think about a relationship, do you? It's  a commercial show. The girl-on-girl is just a variation.|`|Ny4lALx8aa	Actually RoVale, most women secretly like it. Some are open about it, and some are too shy to say anything about it. A huge percentage of women are bi sexual.|`|0cfwrcx5aa	a relationship?  in porn?  huh?|`|9lBe1JGAaa	Its just really sexy. If your watching a video of it, its like your going to be getting action from them anyways lol.|`|un0C52G8aa	It's generally only men who like that. For most women, it's gross.|`|EaurpLufaa	I agree.  We need more guy-on-guy action.  Good stuff...<br>  <br>  On a more serious note, however, some men are really excited at the sight of two females.  They figure that if one alone is hot, then two is doubly hot.  This doesn't make a whole lot of sense, however, since this is lesbianism (and, technically, there is no desire for men in such an activity).|`|U6Fd8MIsaa	Don't worry most women don't like it from my experience.  I don't know what makes love_earth22 think that.  Maybe she is bisexual and hopes that most women are to make herself feel better.  I've noticed a lot of people who are bisexual say things like this.  It would be the same as men and most men aren't bisexual.|`|3862H0WVaa	Alex to be honest it is a turn on and it's not a case you can explain it.<br>  What is interesting though is that some people do project what they like on to others as this question I answered earlier on proves.<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArSzptHZ5Pw2ZW2OJ1cGbIzsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226123319AA2AO5W&show=7#profile-info-n8xr5dg7aa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Personally thought girl/girl stuff is good it can get boring and you want to see them getting fu*ked as well.

6cd0dede1cb5b94c9817d6ec157367bcaa	I suppose it depends- are these voices your own? <br>  <br>  We all have "voices" in our heads telling us we suck--it's just a part of the insecurity that we all have. <br>  <br>  If they are voices that aren't your own that come from somewhere you can't control, you should talk to someone about it.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|NBUBPI7faa	You might have schizophrenia. Talk to a doctor. :)|`|DyviGDAwaa	if the voices are telling you are bad and they are so annoying you tend to be overwhelmed by them....then no it's not normal. Though I'm not saying anyone is normal but when something like this is interfering with your day to day life...it's extremely unhealthy. Talk to a doctor because you made need to find a medicine that can slowly reduce these voices. If you don't want medicine try talking with a clinical pyschologist at first but they can't always help. Good luck and take care|`|qRxhF1ARaa	If it's constant and you can't seem to get rid of it... no, it's not normal. Does that mean you're crazy? No, it doesn't. But, it does sound to me like it would be in your best interest to see a psych doc about this and try to get some sort of treatment for it. That would certainly be the better alternative, as opposed to doing nothing and letting the voices drive you crazy. Talk to a counselor, a doctor, anyone you think can help you, and do it right away. Why suffer with something you may be able to control or stop completely? Get the help, whatever it takes! I say this because you sound desperate and willing to do whatever is necessary to correct the problem. I hope you will! In the meantime, just try to practice some relaxation exercises that will require your focus... like meditation, or deep breathing, or yoga, or anything at all that will take concentration. This will help to make the noise go away. On the other hand, if you dwell on it, it will only get worse, so don't do that! You can actually train your brain to "focus" on, or to "ignore" something. That's why it's so important that you start doing this. I wish you the best!!! And remember... practice makes perfect!

I'd have to meditate on that one. We do seem to be the hands of nature but I would argue about being the brain of nature. They say that global warming is caused by us allowing too many cows to burp. Doesn't seem like we are too smart.

We are not an end-product. Nature is not an entity, it is an abstraction used to describe the sum of life and natural forces on Earth. <br>  If "nature" wanted to create something that was self-aware, there was plenty of time to do so with dinosaurs, they were here for about 300 million years.<br>  <br>  .|`|Wb7n512Waa	All the world was created for the human being. At the level of the minerals, the plants and animals we see that everything works harmoniously together in nature but at the human level we see that man acts according to his own self interests. This is in direct conflict with the laws of nature where all parts work for the collective good. Man is different because he was created with an opposite nature so he can choose to live in accordance to natures laws but he does not escape the painful consequences of exploiting the world for his own profit. The problems that we see all around us such as the economic crisis, war, environmental destruction, social strife, family decay, disease and depression, result from our greed and selfish use of others and the world. To feel these consequences as painful is nature pushing us toward the correct way of relating to others that benefits everyone. It is the balance of nature at work. <br>  <br>  When we can recognize that source of our suffering and problems is our selfishness we can start to reverse our attitude toward each other and the world. We should recognize that we are all part of one whole which are like the cells of a body. In a body we call it cancer when cells absorb and destroy other cells and if it isn't stopped, the body dies. We must choose to get along together for the good of all humanity and when we do we will see our problems disappear and an even higher quality of harmony than we do in an undisturbed forest or plain, or oceans and mountains. Humans were meant to discover the goodness that comes from equalizing with the laws of nature in order that we can be in conscious partnership with nature and receive all the goodness therein. <br>  <br>  Here are two articles and a video on this topic that is really worthwhile: <br>  <a href="http://www.kabtoday.com/epaper_eng/content/view/epaper/2090/(page)/4/(article)/2099" rel="nofollow">http://www.kabtoday.com/epaper_eng/conte...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.laitman.com/2009/03/we-must-become-a-part-of-natures-system/" rel="nofollow">http://www.laitman.com/2009/03/we-must-b...</a> <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhoTCiNrdW4&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhoTCiNrd...</a>|`|19da9b08442f9881cafe78b80940a57baa	Maybe Nature is God, which created this parasite that is destroying nature.|`|QJ5Lh3wUaa	No<br>  <br>  Evolution is not directional. It is not goal driven, other than for organisms to become adapted to their environment (better chance of surviving and reproducing).<br>  <br>  We place high value on self-awareness because we think it is a unique feature of our species.   There is no reason that nature (which doesn't have a mind anyway) should place a premium on self-awareness other than attributes, for example:<br>  <br>  Is a whale an attempt by nature to be able to hold its breath for more than 1 hour?<br>  <br>  Is a kangeroo an attempt by nature to be able to jump very high?<br>  <br>  Is a rat an attempt by nature to gnaw through metals, and eat practically anything?<br>  <br>  Or, are these all, just like human self-awareness, adaptations to particular styles of living.
fa5c4f373a8de64cffa0f9041aaa803aaa	You're looking for a release. Your taking your frustrations out on someone that loves you unconditionally. You know you're Mom will bark at you and tell you to "act right" but you know deep down that she loves you no matter how goofy or rude you act.<br>  The issue is letting a friend say something to you that obviously bothered you more than you thought. Instead of taking out on your Mom or family, you should tell the person how it made you feel. Or address the fact that it was rude, or insensitive or what\ever it was.<br>  That would be the mature thing to do. You talk it out and then you will have harmony in your head and heart.

Chain reaction type of thing, really.<br>  Your body was put at ease when she yelled at you, this allowed you to know you had upset her by your manner. <br>  But - as always - that little nudge in the back of your mind started kicking about and triggered your emotions further, so now you feel guilt.<br>  <br>  It's all a process. <br>  You don't want to say that you're breaking down for a certain reason, maybe because you don't want to admit what it is, so you look for something else to spark it.

Many times you simply put off the experience until later. Because you haven't dealt with it, you can subconsciously take it out on other people--i.e., picking a fight with your mother. Her blow up (the yelling), allowed you to feel the emotional release you hadn't experienced yet from that "little thing" someone said.<br>  <br>  And the feeling sorry for yourself thing, I'd say we all do that when we have an off day- yours just happened to come out in tears.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it- you're not abnormal for experiencing this.

But actually there's a short, to-the-point explanation to this.<br>  <br>  You are actually bothered by the thing that got you "a little upset" in the first place and you're just repressing/expressing it the wrong way. By doing something like picking up a fight or just randomly hyping up your emotion state does not avert you from the problem, as you try to repress it, you may feel a strong sense of shame and guilt and break down by the pressure of it all.<br>  <br>  Please try this at home: Whatever bothers you, don't try to avert your attention away from it no matter how minuscule the problem you may perceive. Vent it out, speak it out with your mom, let her share a little bit of you and she may give you the advice or comfort you want to just zap away the trouble. Just be honest to yourself.<br>  <br>  Also, dealing with the problem on the spot (like telling the person you don't like what s/he's saying and demand an apology) can make you feel much better, too. Although if the problem is insistent, buffer yourself with some understanding and take it home to talk it off.<br>  <br>  I hope you'll be better, don't give in to the urges. Good luck!

vEqUqlliaa	Environmental Psychology - Environmental psychology is an interdisciplinary field focused on the interplay between humans and their surroundings. The field defines the term environment very broadly including all that is natural on the planet as well as social settings, built environments, learning environments and informational environments.<br>  <br>  Origin of Environmental Psychology - The first significant findings in environmental psychology can be traced back to researcher Roger Barker, who founded his research station in the tiny Kansas town of Oskaloosa (renamed "Midwest" for publication) in 1947, and ran it for several decades.<br>  <br>  From detailed field observations he developed the theory that social settings influence behavior. In a store, people assume their roles as customers; in school and church, proper behavior somehow already resides coded in the place. Barker spent his career expanding on what he called ecological psychology, identifying these behavior settings, and publishing accounts like "One Boy's Day" (1951). Some of the minute-by-minute observations of Kansan children from morning to night, jotted down by young and maternal graduate students, may be the most intimate and poignant documents in social science. The "behavior setting" remains a valid principle which receives serious attention.<br>  <br>  Barker argued that the psychologist should use T-Methods (psychologist as 'transducer': i.e. methods which study man in his 'natural environment') rather than O-Methods (psychologist as "operator" i.e. experimental methods). In other words, he preferred field work and direct observation.<br>  <br>  -mohit
glRSKBNfaa	Your answer is almost perfect.  <br>  <br>  "This hurts equilibrium wages and labor " should be finished with: by depressing both, wages directly by taking 4000 to pay for universal health care, and labor supply will decrease as more and more people find it easier to stay home and not work.  <br>  <br>  And for the second part:<br>  The third thing that would happen is employment would rise.  Because there is a financial burden on firms, (whose goal is to maximize profits) some marginal workers will be laid off, freeing up both health care costs and their salaries, increasing profits.  Even just 1 person laid off from 10% of U.S. firms is a huge increase in the unemployment rate.

xGb2CBgkaa	I agree with Meg's comments.  Some additional things:<br>  <br>  -- continue to improve trade relations that reward trade by reducing trade barriers to us goods and services and protecting us intellectual property<br>  <br>  -- invest in public education and reduce financial barriers to higher education<br>  <br>  -- reconsider the existing immigrations rules.  there are so many people who want to work and live in the us, many of these people came on student visas and are working thru h1b's.  it's so hard for them to go through this process that many of them opt to just leave the country and go to another developed country where it's easier to immigrate.  these are folks trained in the us, shouldn't we derive the benefits of their enhanced productivity if they want to live and work here.<br>  <br>  -- government really needs to do some serious additional policy research.  for example, supply siders will tell you that cutting taxes as a rule stimulates investment and thus build wealth.  and this has become a sacred cow for repulicans.  but an economist will tell you there is a big difference between true investment in the productive assets of a country and financial investment.<br>  <br>  --  example.  investing in public education and infrastructure is a long term investment that improves the productivity of our labor and infrastructure assets, which creates more good and thus wealth.  but merely investing money in the stock market doesn't actually make the economy more productive in the long run.<br>  <br>  -- many of the tax cuts have been geared towards rewarding financial investment.  really, we should reconsider the merits of these tax cuts or change the tax code.  for instance, instead of having a 15% capital gains tax, it may make more sense to take it back to 20% and compensate by raising the income bar at which student loan interest payments are no longer tax deductible.|`|JgFkmif9aa	The easiest way to do so is to cut taxes, particularly on capital gains.

So did you see a movie about a straight jacket? or police?or heard about either of these two things from a friend? Also how did you feel when you were getting arrested/ beingputin a straight jacket? Feeling may tell you something important about yourself. Also are you going through a situation in your life where you have no control over something? Do you feel as if you are being put in a "straight jacket" so to speak??<br>  Hope this helps.|`|45b12e3a23b254dfa86c1f9333066f2daa	Are you sexually or emotionally restrained, possibly by guilt or by the authority figures or institutions in your life?  It could also signal that you are feeling apprehension about being restrained or held back in your work or school or even relationship situation.  <br>  The police probably represent an authority figure or institution of order, which also might be keeping you from doing what you want.  The jail represents the restraint or confinement you are feeling or fearing.  The straight jacket represents a more extreme version of the jail, which is "required" by the authority figure because you will not comply easily to the jail confinement.<br>  <br>  Your dreams usually relate to what you have been feeling very recently, such as that day, rather than relate to some long term or prophetic event.|`|SMVsmzi4aa	it means it ain't ever gonna happen. at least that's what my mom says when i tell her about a dream. great advice huh?|`|6OzEsanAaa	maybe your afraid of something like being arrested and not having your rights or something<br>  <br>  it could mean alot of different things! and also we dont know your life! so it could lead to other things in life! ya kno?|`|1f5H6kfvaa	Your probably holding something in, that you should let out.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	<a href="http://www.dreammoods.com/dreamdictionary/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dreammoods.com/dreamdictionar...</a><br>  <br>  go here and you will find your answer|`|QbOYIixuaa	go to the library and check out a dream interpretation book. you'll be amused and it will shed light onto many of your dreams. keep in mind, other than many scientific studies, nobody truly has an exact answer.

5Eb8Zlqmaa	Relevance I found in three certain words, one within each paragraph. For some reason my mind connected Black, Darkness, and Stronger [which I am seeing rather as Strength]<br>  <br>  In all cases, you're trying to escape something. Just like in all cases, there is a negative force driving you to your need to get away.<br>  You were protected in the first dream, and your protector found death. So in your second, you become the protector for the child, both getting attacked but managing that escape. You learned from the experience of death to your previous protector, and so your life was spared along with the childs. <br>  In the third, you mention no one but yourself. You're sensing the danger, which I associate with Black, and Darkness, along with sensing the need to get away because it is growing, associating with 'the flow growing stronger' AKA, Strength I mentioned earlier.<br>  <br>  Is there any unusual stress in your life right now - Even something that seemed to be a small nuisance and has built up over time, something that you can now see for its negativity?<br>  Because it would seem that your mind is trying to take caution against some force in your life.|`|533aec411376adde47ba86f66a0aa949aa	Notice how you 'switch' roles between the first two dreams, eventhough the background symbolism stays basically the same?<br>  <br>  In the first dream, you are the kid who runs to your aunt's house for protection, but in the second, you are the 'adult' keeping some familiar kid safe. It's also suggestive that both first two dreams appear in very 'familiar' surroundings.<br>  <br>  A neighborhood at night can resemble a 'forest', since points of refuge are both rare and surrounded by primal fears.<br>  <br>  Basically dream 1 is the 'somethings wrong so i better find someplace safe to go to' dream. Dream 2 is really the sequel, getting the baton passed onto it, with you taking on the role of the 'aunt', and since your aunt got 'killed' in the first dream, and since you have taken her place, the dream didn't finish most likely because the outcome (you getting 'killed' so the child could live) wasn't something your mind was prepared to handle.<br>  <br>  Dream 3 is really just a summation of the feelings of dreams 1 and 2. Because you can't figure out what's chasing you while you are still in the dreams, just like you can't figure out whats going on with the water while you're standing somewhere close to it, the water is pushing you 'out' of that place so that you can go somewhere safe and survey your position. Since the dream allowed you to identify your aunt, maybe the fear is generational, of following in her footsteps or her life, making it seem like an impossible cycle repeating itself.<br>  <br>  Little Red Riding Hood went to her Grandmother's house, but really anyone can play the Grandmother. The 'wolf' in familiar clothing still means the same thing.

qq5nceCXaa	Yes<br>  <br>  Oil prices have dropped, demand for other key Industries (e.g. aluminuim smelting) has also dropped and the Norwegian oil Fund has suffered as the markets have collapsed.<br>  <br>  Still with no real Sovereign Debt to speak of, a highly educated population and an economy that is rooted in natural resource utalisation it's probably doing better than most.  Oh the restructuring of the Scandinavian Banks after the 1992 banking crisis means that Scandinavian banks haven't been exposed as badly as some of the UK ones for instance.

Therefore, my wife left me because of Feminism. This upsets the "natural" order, as women are only entitled to one lifestyle, which is that of wife and mother. No matter how I behave, the woman I marry should be forced to stay with me. Never mind that women were forced to stay in miserable marriages for centuries, or that they had no financial recourse should they leave (it wasn't that long ago that women were not in the workforce). These men blame feminism itself on their personal problems. They want us to automatically believe that the judges and lawyers on their cases (who, by the way, are all part of the vast feminism conspiracy. This, even if the judge and lawyers are right wingers) treated them unfairly, without allowing us to ever see the whole story. They provide statistics that upon examination, do not support their claims of being discriminated against, and they regularly bad mouth the mothers of their children (a big no-no for mothers and fathers alike. Doing so is pretty much an automatic loss in family court, whoever does it.) It never seems to cross their mind that their relationship problems may have something to do with their own behavior, and instead place the blame on women who, thirty-some years ago, worked to enact the current laws. Could their relationship breaking up really be the fault of feminism, and not some deficiency in their own personality?  <br>  www.mensrightsblogs|`|lqI8QZ9Eaa	LOL! Go bloggers!

Research methodology as a graduate, and like someone previously stated, psychology is considered a science... If you struggle with math, look into schools that have substitution courses for receiving associates or bachelor's degree. (such as math for critical thinking.)

p7Z4CU9qaa	In the Victorian era the black rose had many meanings, one being  death.  For instance if given to an enemy it would mean vengeance by death but if given to a boyfriend/girlfriend it could mean a death of their love (breaking up).   <br>  It also has some positive connotations. If given during a time of change it represents not only  death of the old but also the renewal or rebirth (new beginnings).  The black rose's meanings also include courage and resistance, mutany and strength.    <br>  <br>  Because the meaning could be so ominous it was very rarely given unless the context would be clear to the receiver.|`|CwH0ThH4aa	They're not for death, I know that much.

wKN7n2RKaa	Did you have a bad experience yourself or see a scary movie that freaked you?  Try to figure out what exactly got you so scared.  Think of all the things that you are scared of, then try to figure out why you think it would happen.  Talk to your mom, and go through each thing, of how it would be difficult or impossible for these things to happen.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, try this...<br>  <br>  Maybe you can get a baseball bat or something like it and have it close to your bed.  If you feel more powerful, more in control about someone hurting you, that you can fight back, it could make for feel less scared.  Just don't smash your mom by mistake!<br>  <br>  You could get a timer, and try to increase the time you can keep the light off.  If you can get through half a minute (or whatever time you can) and not get scared, then reward yourself.  Celebrate!  It's a great thing.  Work it out a reward system with your mom.  Keep a record of it.  When you get through it, try for longer, and work for a bigger reward.  Don't punish yourself if you can't on some nights or even get worse.  Just tell yourself that you will try again the next night.  <br>  <br>  Remember, that fear is in your head.  There are some people who can stand on top of skyscrapers, and not be scared, and others who can't look out of second floor windows.  If your brain is scared, you have to teach it not to be.  You have the power.  And you are starting it already, because you don't want to be scared.  Good job!  I know you will beat this.|`|HWT7thUkaa	1. try to figure out what made you scare of the dark in the first place and isolate that thing or thought.<br>  2. start off easy.get in a comfortable room, your bedroom is ideal, then start by turning off all the lights and just leaving the door open.<br>  3. sit in your room while thinking about pleasant thoughts for 30 minutes or so<br>  4. gradually start shutting the door until the room is completely dark<br>  5. after you become comfortable with the door closed, no lights, and completely dark, close your eyes and try process number 3 again.|`|efmaKbfxaa	Most of he people of the age get scared in the dark.To overcome this type of things.u have to build up self confidence in urself.Don't concentrate on such type of things.Don't see here and there while studying.Then u will succeed ur life|`|IBnRpVCpaa	If you're embarrassed about it, don't be. I'm 17, and I still get very afraid of the dark, too, as do alot of people in our age group. I try to think about it as logically as possible. I say to myself, "I've made it through every night just fine before, so why should this be any different?" What also makes it alot easier for me is that I have cats. I know I have absolutely no reason to freak out unless they're freaked out, and I've never seen them truly frightened by anything. Keeping something that can be used as a weapon close by also makes me feel ALOT better. If your fear is truly a phobia, and you can't get over it, or even think about it logically, you probably should talk to someone about it. But mostly, you just have to tell yourself that nothing's going to happen. One other thing that I used to do as a little kid (and this is going to sound childish and silly, but it works!) is I would have my imaginary friend put up a force field that would protect me from any harm. It made me feel 100% better, and I've done it recently, even, probably after seeing a particular scary movie...It's just about finding things that will comfort you. And good luck!|`|8jKzMOboaa	I was the same way till I was 12. Fear leaves you as soon as you find out that the night is dark and the day is light.Stop watching scary movies before you go to bed. Try a comedy and see if that make a difference. Or talk to a girlfriend on the phone, you wont want her to know that  your scared of the dark.|`|dfENRKNIaa	go to a psyche, you need help.

GhjYSDKGaa	Don't go see a doctor. They'll only suggest that you go on some type of medication, and this won't cure you. You may feel less depressed so often, but as soon as you stop using the medication, the problem will still be there, because it doesn't get rid of the problem. The problem is inside of you, and it needs to be addressed, so it can be released. Figure out what it is that is making you sad. I know when I get sad I have to dig deep for the root of it. I may at first say it is because the kids are just getting to me and I need a break, or because we have no money, or because my husband works long hours, and I'm lonely. But when I dig deeper, I may find out it is because I feel like I am a failure as a wife and mother. My kids are uncontrollable one day( but then I remember they are just kids with their own little personalities, and personalities clash sometimes, I can;t expect them to be little robots.), and I never get to see my husband( but we do set aside 2 hours after the kids go to bed to spend time together, which is more than some couples do), and I'm a stay at home mom, and I could be working and helping out financially, since we are considered lower class( but in actuallity I am helping the family out by setting a good foundation for the kids because I'm experiencing every moment of their little lives, and am there to support them in everything they do, and that's more important at the moment than having material things.) I have to dig deep for the root of the problem and find the positive in the choices I have made. And if there are no positives, then I am completely free to choose to do something different, to turn it into a positive experience, always. First make the choice to want your life to be positive. Then examine the root of your depression, find out where it is really coming from(could it be that you feel like a failure in a certain area in your life? Or you can't find the right relationship, and you just want someone to love you for who you are? Or maybe you are still dwelling on a negative past experience?) But dig deep and figure out the root of your sadness. Then make the choice to make some change about it, to make it turn into the positive experience you desire. Sometimes it may not seem like it, but there is always a choice you can make to turn it positive. You have the power to control what you experience, and your feelings also. Sometimes I face a problem, and making a change in it is beyond my control. But then I remember that I can still make a choice, the choice to realize that it is beyond my control at the moment, and accept that, but change my attitude. If it's beyond my control, then why worry about it, because that won't change a thing. Instead I will choose to be happy under the circumstances, because that I DO have control over. Stay positive always, change the things you can, and accept the things you can't change at the moment. That is the key to getting over depression.I know because I used to be there, for six years, and I came out of it on my own, no medication or psychiatry needed. I still get down now and then, but I remember that the power to change my situation is in my hands and my hands only. You can do it. Good luck.|`|m2bAl2t1aa	See a Doctor. It might pass naturally but you really could be this way permanently.<br>  Some people fix up their situations on their own but many really can't.

Yes! As soon as possible. I cannot believe that people fear medication this much! It was not made for pigs! But for human beings. <br>  <br>  Depression is serious. It's painful. I should know. And it is not only psychological, it's also physical and neuronal. Different neurones are to blame for depression. We now know that. So the problem will NOT pass with time. Your body needs these neurones to work properly and antidepressants are made to make these neurones get back to normal.<br>  <br>  But you also need to see a therapist. They are not there to cure pigs either! You know what I believe: we have the answer deep down inside of ourselves. But we sometimes need to hear ourselves telling someone else before we realize what the problems and mostly the solutions are.<br>  <br>  Crying every day is not normal. Life can be beautiful girl! Make it become beautiful! <br>  <br>  If it can help: I went through depression. Instead of dealing with it, I drank and stoned my way through it. After five years of pain, five years of making things worse, I chose to see a doctor and ask for help. I took medication. I don't anymore. And I am one happy woman studying psychology. I've lost weight. I quit drugs and alcohol two years ago. <br>  <br>  Good luck... you can choose to change things.

First let me say as a (blind) person I am not offended by this question. Second, I have been blind since birth. The answer to your question is actually one that may surprise some of you. The person who answered your question about the wiring of the brain is correct. However, in what way do you express seeing? Since I have been blind all of my life, I do dream. I smell things, hear things, feel emotions if awakened from a bad dream, and yes I see. I see by feeling. It is intresting to hear some of the questions about blindness. I don't mind answering the questions. Just keep something in mind. As a group of people that have blindness as a disability we are all not the same. That would be like implying that all Italian people like Italian food. If you did a survey of blind people you would find that we all have different querks about us. We are all not the same as a sighted person or disabled person.<br>  If you would like to ask  more questions or whatever please email me.|`|551e9dbeb03021a0909944063a2e88c4aa	no. born-people can not watch their dreams. they can not watch any thing there for they just listen and there are all around a darkness whole thing is black in their dream|`|f19624f0e71f9a148435db0345e77669aa	No, they wouldn't. Visual stimulus is necessary for the wiring of the brain centers that process and interpret vision. The way the brain works is to develop, early in life, a huge number of neural synapses (connection points between neurons that are used in cell-to-cell signalling). As you grow and learn, these synapses are pared away to make the brain function efficiently, and that's the central basis of long-term learning. However, if the brain or any part of it fails to get infromation from hard-wired inputs, then that part of the brain will atrophy (at best, fringe areas of a cortical region might be adopted by adjacent cortical regions for different processes). But the take-away message here is that the brain needs visual stimulus in order to devolp the cortical regions that process vision. In the use-it-or-lose-it sense, the brain will not waste energy building and maintaining processes that aren't used. The optical cortex would never know how to function as an optical cortex in a person born blind.
0kVObu8paa	First you need to think about what a rise in interest rates will do.<br>  <br>  A rise in interest rates will mean two things:<br>  <br>  1. The cost of borrowing increases.<br>  2. The benefit of saving increases.<br>  <br>  This will, in turn, lead to two things:<br>  <br>  1. Less consumer durables will be bought (due to increased cost of borrowing money), and less investment from business will take place (for the same reason).<br>  <br>  2. More people will begin to save (because the benefits increase from saving, i.e. more money will be made on saving).<br>  <br>  Now, what effect might this have on the economy?<br>  <br>  Well, aggregate demand will immediately fall as a result of a reduction in borrowing and therefore purchases of consumer durables and investment. Furthermore, if more saving takes place, less money is being 'spent'. Aggregate demand will certainly fall in the economy.<br>  <br>  But by how much? That's a very hard thing to say, but with a small change in interest rates the impact it has upon these factors will of course be smaller too. You'd be safe to conclude that aggregate demand would fall by a small amount in the economy. <br>  <br>  I hope my reply answers your question sufficiently.
qjMP3EiGaa	My childhood was in the 1960's and my teens/early 20's was in the 1970's.  I can't speak as an expert on all time & eternity, but my generation was definitely worse than my parents, and this current generation of young people is worse than mine.  Of course I am speaking of morals and behavior.<br>  The generation I grew up in was rabidly rebellious, and since the old saying about reaping what you sow happens to be true, we've raised a generation of disrespectful, dysfunctional people.  Of course, there will be those who take serious offense to what I just said, but if you will be honest and take a long, hard look not only at statistics, but all around you, you will see the truth.|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	yes, we are much much worse, but I blame the Baby Boomers for it.<br>  <br>  Darn baby boomers.|`|qgLb7YMEaa	todays generation is definately worse if you're talking about crime today,when i was a teenager in the 60's knife and gun crime was never heard of like it is today and the law is too laxed and the kids lack discipline and pc is getting ridiculous.<br>  i'm not saying all kids are the same but generally in this way,yes it's worse|`|8470e71235a1de4ef62a36c03e3fcc4baa	We seem to be getting worse in terms of RESPECT AND MORALS  yet we seem to be getting better in SOCIAL ISSUES, RACE ISSUES, WOMENS RIGHTS, I mean less than 150 years  ago there were still slavery going on in this country, women were expected to be treated like property than human beings, and racism was eveywhere. <br>  <br>  We as a civlization have improved on how we treat each other..... yet in many ways we have gotten much worse.|`|AA11952258	I do!!!!

There is no global warming the way it is fashionably described in our time. In thirty years time capitalism and free trade based society will be finished.

The borders of national states will be done away with while the states themselves will be transformed into regional cultural entities. Economically new states or state organizations will be formed. China will be evolved into another world power with India, starting their cooperative aeronautic program for the research of the outer space with manned flights to Moon and Mars. By 2030 multi-level cities will exist with a world population ten times as great as it is today. The technology will have made a progress equal to that made the last 150 years.

An acquaintance of mine uses phrases such as "I take extra care of what I buy so it keeps it color and shape." or  "I spend a good deal or time seeking out a bargain in the more elite shops."

'Up to date' things would tend to suggest that you 'keep up to date' these things that you have, and in order to do this would mean that you are spending time and money in doing so (given that 'things' can become quite quickly dated when newer models come along).    This might give people (if it matters to them) the wrong idea about you quite easily.    How you get them to 'lay off of you' in this matter is one thing, and the way you ask them to 'lay off of it' is to maybe suggest that they mind their own business and that you need these (whatevers for)  ....whatever reason you choose to give (if you choose to do so).    For some reasons, some people, once you have sparked their curiosity / interest in you, can see something an some kind of anomaly about a person and it becomes like an itch upon which they can build a whole house of un~imagined fantasies.     You can either take the simple route and explain, ''I work hard for a living and choose to spend my money on this / that etc'', or you can maybe take the maybe more difficult route of asking them to please 'not be so nosey as to how you spend your hard earned money' (and or maybe you'll return the favour on them and their lifestyle).    If this 'possessions' thing is such a problem, them try to be more circumspective in how and where you use it ~ or in their eyes, flaunt it.    Sash.

AA10894849	That really does depend on your doctor. Some are more flexible than others.  Personally, if someone's insurance runs out, I approach my office manager and ask if we can change them to a self-pay, reduced-rate client. If the office manager approves, we stop billing the insurance and the client pays a much smaller fee per session.   I have a client that I've been seeing for a long time and she really wanted her mother to come and see me. I wasn't an approved provider on her mother's insurance and her mother's insurance paid next to nothing for her sessions. Her mother would have had to drive out of town and pay like $75 per session out of pocket and this family didn't have a lot of money. So, I cleared it with the office manager and offered to see her mother for about 1/4 of our usual rate (which is usually the amount of the typical co-pay).   The American Psychological Association actually encourages psychologists to see some patients at a low reduced rate or to offer some services for free.   Ask your doctor. If she is not willing to help out, look up your local community mental health center. They usually offer services on a sliding scale.|`|AA11971891	It depends on the doctor.
XHCoIo3zaa	The best way to protect youth from negative influences is by providing positive influences in the home.  This means that the parents must have strong ethical and moral values and pass them on to their children.  <br>  <br>  Trying to limit the sex, violence, etc. commonly found on the internet, tv, cinema, etc. will not work in isolation.

XHCoIo3zaa	I lived in Afghanistan as a development worker in the early 90s where I saw what I would consider to be medieval living conditions.  Here are some of my observations in rural Afghanistan.<br>  <br>  1. People used donkeys as a means of transportation.<br>  2. Houses were made of mud and had not electricity or modern conveniences.<br>  3. The water supply came from a contaminated well or pond. The color of the water was usually green.<br>  4. Women had at least five children and were expected to take care of them.<br>  5. Women had to prepare very simple meals.<br>  6. The general hygiene was unacceptable by modern standards.<br>  7. Most women had virtually no formal education.<br>  8. Life expectancy was about 40 years.<br>  9. Women often worked in the field along with men during times when labor was in short supply.<br>  10.  People used outhouses.<br>  11.  The stoves burned wood.<br>  12.  Women in their late teens or early twenties were often stunningly attractive, but once they reached their mid-thirties, they looked old and haggard.  This is due to the hard lives they had.<br>  13.  Religion dominated their view of the world.<br>  <br>  I once quipped to a friend in a letter (this was pre-internet) that many people believe that the middle ages actually took place in the middle ages.

25be43271b4b27cbc3399865507eac63aa	Ever person is different. I occasionally have lucid dreams but I have never attempted to control them. They come when I have been involved in a perod of intense spiritual growth doing such things as astro projection, meditation and creative visualisition. There are books on that sort of thing. Just do a search on Book: lucid deams. There is an herb that I have heard some use. Its called Mug Wart. <br>  <br>  There is a technique that I try sometimes. When I wake up at the end of a dream I relax and move back into the dream and work to change the ending. I do kung fu on the bad guy so to speak or make love to the beutiful woman.<br>  <br>  Dreams come from our uncouncious mind. We are part of the dream disigner, the script writer.

And if you have anxiety disorder and depression, it might be a good idea not to dive into thoughts much.<br>  <br>  Through the years I never gave up or gave in. It's been a long hard struggle. But it changed for the last couple of years.<br>  <br>  Therapy helped a lot, my thoughts became less obsessive. My approach became smoother.<br>  <br>  I 'slowed down' and I can now see how automated responses happen (logical, emotional and physical)<br>  <br>  By slowing down, I do not mean pushing your urges down. But accepting them as they are and lowering the tempo (yes it's easier said than done)<br>  <br>  Your resources are now diminished, but your demand is high. Lower the demand a little bit and work your way up.<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|p30X1pHjaa	Hi honey,<br>  <br>  Hair loss ain't that bad, I found  my husband alluring when he shaved off his hair, I think its great now that he is losing his hair big time (he is 33). Please don't take these drugs for a kind of vanity. Your new lady doesn't look and say I wish you were someone else I'm sure.<br>  <br>  I know about depression and panic attacks and acknowledging them is a very big step to getting better. You will recover but it takes time and work, it is a road of ups and downs and you must have help, so speak to someone (anyone)(doctor, nurse, counsellor). If they suggest anti depressants take them and change them if they don't help. They will help until one day (maybe a few years later yu won't need them) but if you do need them forever (so what I take thyroxine for life).<br>  <br>  Impotence can be addressed by doctors and counsellors, what I know though is that stress and depression and worry isn't helpful. I am sure your lady if she is right will stand by you. Children ??? adopt, foster. I'm sure you will love them the same as would your mum.<br>  <br>  So tomorrow start afresh and everyday start afresh. Everyday get up and do something, anything even if you don't want to. Just do it, its great and the rainbows and the rain and life will slowly get brighter.<br>  <br>  "Start by doing what is necessary, then what is possible and suddenly your doing the impossible"<br>  <br>  Sorry I waffle. xxx
zD5JwEjdaa	if its something meaning ful to you keep it to yourself and focus on it.... as far as bizarre crazy dreams ..those u can tell..|`|TnTXGNyMaa	dreams only become reality if you pursue them, and make them happen.|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	No, if that was the case i would have slept with some of my wife's friends.  And, I can tell you that has only happened while dreaming.|`|J5zj8dWRaa	I hope not!  I have crazy dreams.  If dreams become reality, I'm in trouble since I just told a coworker this one from last night...  I'll be kidnapped by my neighbor (who grew a "Cast-away" beard) and taken to the fair.  At the fair, he'll scare me out of my wits by forcing me at hot-dog-point (not gun) to get onto the Ferris Wheel.  Before the car we're in gets more than a few feet off the ground, my Knight in Shining Armor (literally dressed as a knight) will rescue me from the neighbor, who turned into a giant gummi bear and is sticking to the seat of the Ferris Wheel.  Little kids will yell for joy, and come running from all directions to get a piece of the neighbor-turned-gummi-bear...  The dream went on from there, but I'll stop.
J5zj8dWRaa	I don't know about artists, but for humanity in general...<br>  <br>  People need to feel appreciated, like their lives are worth living - everyone fulfills that need differently (some methods are more healthy than others), and need a different level of validation.  If you're living a life where you don't feel like you're getting the praise you deserve, that can negatively affect your life.|`|5Eb8Zlqmaa	Lack of appraisal and reassurance can kill any person. Sometimes simply giving it to ourselves is not enough. <br>  <br>  <br>  Being an artist, the outlet created by diving into what we do best does seem personally vital. However, recognition doesn't prove itself as important. As long as I understood it, and I found something of meaning inside of what I've done I find it an accomplishment.<br>  It is always nice to hear from other sources that what you have done you have in fact, done well. <br>  So maybe lack of both could kill the starving artist. But simply lack of one, will not.<br>  If you are true to it you will manage through no matter what, because as an artist you will see there are more important things than material praise and titles.|`|x5ftqjo5aa	everyone wants their skills appreciated
gxGOwHC0aa	i wouldnt say anything was wrong with you.  come to think about it I am the same way.  A lot of ppl are  dont put yourself down because of it.  i cant just go to a random crowd and start a conversation lol its nerve racking lol    Now the failure thing you need to work on.  Life is all about being successfull and failing  its nature.   you will fail in somethings and that is perfectly fine.. pick youself up and try again and keep on trying.    Do u speak up in class?   forexample in my english class the professor wants everyone to speak and interact.  I would be so scared to have to talk infront of the class because i didnt know everyone. After i started doing it 9because HE made me) i started becoming more confortable. and its getting better and better.   Maybe if you try to talk more in class your nervousness about talkin to strange ppl will start going away    good luck|`|zIMlCnVsaa	There's nothing wrong with you. I think everyone is somewhat like this at one point in their lives. I see nothing wrong with this, it's just how you prefer meeting new people. Everyone has different preferences so don't let this get you down. Just be yourself and follow your instinct.|`|AA10447831	nothing, all perfectly normal|`|7Vgpz1Zlaa	There is nothing wrong with you. Everybody feels more comfy when there friends are present. You just need to work a little on bein so freakin shy. If people like you with your friends, they will like you with out them.|`|rCeD6nffaa	nothing just force yourself to talk to different and "NEW" people so you  will just get used to that sort of stuff, It works it really does!!!!!!|`|QnnmJEuraa	Seems to me like you just take while to warm up to new people.  Like everyone, there is a certain amount of anxiousness or insecurity in meeting new people...for some more than others. Having your close friends around when meeting new people serves as some sort of security blanket.  They are there if something "goes wrong".  Not only that but when meeting a new frien via an old friend, this kind of "vouches" for you to say that your cool enough to be this new person;s frined.   My advice to you would be to realize that typically, all of the new people you are going to meet are just as nervous to meet you.
