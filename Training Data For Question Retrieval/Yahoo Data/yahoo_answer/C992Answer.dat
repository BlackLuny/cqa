exARv7Bmaa	I think it's got something to do with a lack of money!    Seriously, over the past decade or so, there's been far too much money going out and nowhere near enough coming in. Too much dependance on there being a 'sugar daddy' of sorts and reliance on future TV deals. It's probably going to get a lot worse before it gets better.|`|IXSGaD5aaa	coz were in a country with 5 million ppl so obviously weve not got the money england spain italy germany etc|`|cTTmHn9paa	Celtic ARENT skint!

I think its like Michele says, they are hoping Rangers mess up for 4 in a row and then maybe just maybe there's some truth that Strachan may leave and they dont want to fork out till next season.    Also how is it we can claim were skint when teams in the EPL like Man Utd are like over 100 million in debt. dont make sense to me how they can still afford top players..|`|c75d7684a8af4dc243578c5ed81236b8aa	It's not just the football clubs but the whole country is feeling the pinch Fudgie Bhoy. The thing that changed how much cash is in the game was the 'Bosman 1+2' situation.  Clubs owned the rights and registration of players outright and as such the club wanting the player had to pay through the nose, this also showed as assets in the clubs balance sheets, giving them great borrowing power. The subsiquent afore mentioned Bosmans made all that obsolete, thus rendering clubs into a situation that they were ill equipped for.  If we take Rangers as an example, you had a chairman willing to sail as close to the wind in achieving success on the field with little or no regard to the cost, then that creates a marketplace that either you get in on or you fold. The gamble was to attain the level of success and hope that the players would be saleable enough to sustain the spending required to achieve the lofty heights in Europe. The fans would then be overcharged for a product that is 'unmissable'.  The players owning their own registration means that they can negotiate their own contracts and cut out the clubs main income.  Things as they were could never be reasonably expected to continue but the avarice demands of the supporters are such that once you are pot commited, you either run with it or cut your losses, that is David Murray's only mistake, in my opinion, he should have known when the time was right to leave.  The money is still there but just not in Scottish Football.  Malks has it all...........Hahahahaha!!|`|5tsyS7Kpaa	The Scottish FA can't get a telly deal because it's a joke.

IGb7gXpZaa	Neither of the clubs actually stated that the move failed.Arsenal submitted the paperwork yesterday and that's the reason why Arshavin actually could transfer to Arsenal with the transfer market already expired.Both clubs knew that the transfer was a matter of time, however the press released rumors that the deal had failed seeing that the transfer market had ended and no deal was confirmed.|`|LdJFFvSVaa	http://www.sportinglife.com/clients/tisc...|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Russians always say the opposite of what they mean...|`|WfcWglHCaa	because there just trying to cause trouble but a good signing for arsenal on the whole

uEjh3CAbaa	its a good idea to sand down to bare metal then fill your dent with some fine car body filler then sand down.Give it a few coats of primer then sand it down lightly with fine wet and dry paper then another coat of primer and sand lightly,give it two coats of black then sand again lightly and then final coat after that has dried,give it a few coats of lacquer.  This is all best done in a bit of warmth and a dust free environment shed is good if it is clean and on a calm warm day.You may be waiting a while with the weather as it is now,but you could still strip the bike down and get it ready for that warm day!|`|OCMrQVRxaa	no just key it (80then120) prime 2000 prime 2500 paint 2000 wet and dri do it wet then lightly laqer|`|FIG58FVpaa	Do you or your brother know a lot about bike repair? You really should take the bike completely apart before painting it. There are tons of people who don't and it either comes out horribly and/or paint gets in the bearings and on the rims and the bike rides like crap for awhile...    Once the bike is completely apart, sand it down until it's at least smooth and not shiny any more. (You don't need to go all the way to bare metal... but if you can, that will work much better.) Apply primer. Use a couple thin coats and let them dry before putting another coat on. Do the same with the paint and clear. The instructions on the cans will tell you how long to let the coats dry.    Make sure to let the paint dry completely before putting the bike back together.    I've also found that for some reason it works better if you use primer, paint and clear from the same company.|`|DFug1qB2aa	yea dude take ALL the paint off weight is everyting now a days in bmxing and paint is weight if i were u i would strip it to bare metal now in the winter or whenever u have time then when it gets abit warmer paint it in your shed good luck!!
AA12082577	It's a total disgrace...."the best ground in England" ...I don't Fuc'ing think so...maybe if they weren't so skint, they could've put a pound in the meter and turned the under soil heating on, if they really have any!!    But to call it off 24 hours early, just proves they are scared ahead of Sunday!! look at the teams who played tonight!!|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	Its not the Stadium.. Its the fact that hardly any fans would be able to travel to the game... IT turns out the weather was ok today... But last night worse weather was forecast so the thought they may as well call if off in advance... As much as i like to slag off arsenal... There is no need to in this case.... I will be doing that at about 3 o clock on Sunday|`|m7tjMSDCaa	what type of stupid question is that...did you even see the picture of the stadium, and how were the fan even going to get there anyway with no public transport working...|`|ypfroy9haa	sounds like they running scared of weekend game|`|AA12370193	i bet thats what you want.    @Duke: Why wait til sunday?|`|zJCWIWE0aa	IT WAS BECAUSE OF FANS SAFETY NOT DA PITCH|`|c1wYc2syaa	With you  Baz, who the fcku is rammaccca? sounds like a camel shagger.  Even Bin Laden supported the scum!|`|V4STBjyFaa	there's nothing wrong with the pitch the only reason its been postponed is due to the safety off the fans getting to the stadium check your facts b4 u post gimp boy     edit@bazspud im an evertonian from the north west you inbred flid    edit2@bazspud touched a nerve have i yid flid    edit3@bazspud u got nothin right u short armed flid i bet youve got deep pockets u jew boy|`|WdOAxQmoaa	"how the fck are they allowed to do that"    i wouldnt like you being the head of the FA if we arent aloud to call off a game becouse of 10ft snow on the pitch.    common sense to call off the match,there's more snow to be forcast tomorrow aswell.|`|V8HwYLlXaa	Well London shut down last night didn't it. And anyway I think its a good call seeing as Cardiff fans would be travelling down to London in their thousands but today Wales has been hit hard by the weather as predicted. Arsenal did something right. Good on them.
EsTAylwIaa	it may well be but all you have to do is ask a question and sit back and wait for some of the answers which will probably have nothing to do with your question|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Everytime i talk about lower league teams, all i get is "who cares" so i don't bother, just come in here for the easy points|`|bej55wxUaa	I see your point.   Must say though, Falgee, Lammy, Saoirse and even XXccXX, (when he makes an effort, as opposed to telling folk they are talking sh1te), and many others from non-old firm teams contribute plenty to the forum.    Expect a rant from........    Listen to the bold Adele, lol.  Gon yersel hen ! xxx    Malks, where is my thumbs down ?      It's OK, I see it now, cheers !|`|8IzeMTmLaa	Haha, I concur...|`|217ff35a8ea8ca73e63af6072240aa24aa	well give us some input then son ,its an open forum ,as a celtic fan im not going to ask Q s about Hibs or give two hoots about hearts am I ,If you dont like it no - ones forcing anyone to be here|`|S0LSmJ9haa	no cos the input from the other teams fans is the only way to break up the monotony of shite throwing that we do.  52 in the bag GRRRRRRRRRR  WATP GRRRRRRRRRRRR  4IAR GRRRRRRRRRRRRR  Celtic not signing GRRRRRRRRR  Murray skint GRRRRRRRRRRR    what do we think of Hibs new signing....ARGGGGGGHHHHHH relax :-)|`|BdiQPKn0aa	No, i don't think non old firm supporters would be too happy with that...yourself included    Thanks for the thumbs, it's good to know that people actually read what i type...:-)|`|cTTmHn9paa	Its the lack of non old firm fans. Its not our fault there are no other fans!|`|smA22aNHaa	Why not?|`|h7GtCCC7aa	Thats how most of the Old Firm fans in here see it/want it.    My advice is, if it gets you down, laugh it off and give them some abuse and if you want to discuss Dundee, go for it, there are one or two people, myself included who will participate (see yous next season...)    As Trooper says, if you say anything against Celtic, you are branded a 'hun'.... if you slag off Rangers, you receive e-mails calling you 'fenian scum' ....It's pretty laughable really    *Nice to see Big Chief ain't talking sh1te for once haha|`|5vuC2GSXaa	Yes or give them idiotic twats their own section then let the real fans get a say|`|QfAlbKH9aa	there is little else in scottish football except celtic and rangers so what do you expect|`|nH4TOhGVaa	lol yes u r right but that's up to the supporters of other clubs to post questions|`|MPqO1Qayaa	Bampots are us it should be called    i have lost count of the times i have been called a hun or a tim when its bloody plain to see i hate the two teams with a passion.    some of the regulars here, or people who constantly talk pish, are the very ones who throw accusations about because i predict on Falgees predictor that Rangers will lose to Dundee United and Celtic will beat Hamilton,     my idea? give Rangers and Celtic huge superdomes as their grounds, completely enclosed to keep the pitch safe from our weather, allow every fan to live in the stadium.....and then fill them both with water|`|GkFlzMHMaa	Willy its a bit of a joke mate. If you kind of stick up for one, the others attack you with all kinds of shite, and vice versa. That is if you support a team out-with the Old Firm..If you ask Questions on the other teams in the SPL you get shot down with yes you guessed it shite..If you fight back against one user, the rest of the users of that particular users team, will turn against you..    This is one of the very few places left on the Internet where bigotry, narrow mindedness is still rife, it gets outlawed on other forums..    If you want to talk about Football, with-out the OF try the footymad.net forums although  on the Scotland board it is still there, but you can get away from it, as most teams in Scotland have there own message boards on there...    Thats right Malks we used to smash up you Celtic fans on London Road as well, that is when we caught you right enough...|`|c97e18e356f8c6c65740d12fc018416baa	Well if it is you just wasted a chance to ask a question about an other team,most people in Scotland And definitely in the west where its most populated Support either of the big two (Celtic and Thistle lol) so it stands to reason they are going to be more of us in here,but there is plenty in here from the other teams who feel just as passionately about there own teams.  Billy there it is if you need thumbs ,from 2 to 3 magic ,are you ever right.hahahaha  And Rusty it's not just the the Old Firm who have their bigots,remember your casuals running amok smashing windows beating up bystanders ,don't you think that could be called bigotry?|`|OFBjRYXVaa	you have just added to the old firm questions|`|AMTIwdQ2aa	Bawz|`|c75d7684a8af4dc243578c5ed81236b8aa	No.  I like the fact that other teams fans are on here.  The majority of footballing people are either Celtic or Rangers fans, so it stands to reason that most would be apt to voicing their opinions in favour of those two teams but there are some notable and decent supporters of other teams that are regularly contributing to these pages. You just need to shuffle out the shite and read the gems.|`|DpfJfK6Baa	you are right, in a way...  but there are plenty of others who support non-OF teams.  The OF questions are sometimes OK, but there is too much petty bickering between the two groups and it bores me.      I am always pleased to see non-OF questions on here, and I tend to answer them.|`|42ccd0237aece050a7edd0401d817205aa	well you've posted an "old firm" question so you tell us! :-p

huto12P3aa	Yea he was horribly treated, a pointless buy really if rafa wants gerrard up with Torres.

Very appalling to say the least. Keano was starting to settle in, finding his form, and guess what, he was taken out of the next game. Then eventually sold.|`|Pfq2zRejaa	Rafa didn't want him he didn't sign him parry did|`|Y7CH521faa	I think Rafa has shown himself to be even more clueless this season than most of us previously thought.  If Liverpool end up without a trophy i suspect the old ranter will be out at the end of the season.|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	Im glad they treated him like that,... My fave player is back where he belongs with a team and fans that respect him.... At the Lane on Sunday i will be getting his name on the back of my black strip.. (as soon as i find out what number he has!!) Dont normally get names on the back but i feel this time its justified|`|duJgBxUoaa	Yes, he was treated terribly.  But that's Rafa for ya :)|`|PrsbAjZAaa	Keane was like Kuyt at Liverpool  wasn't really there most important player , but he give 100% in his appearances      fair enough , he didn't achieve alot in them appearances , but the effort was there    i meen if your going to spend 20 million on someone , you would expect to keep him for longer than 6 month before sending him back to his old club    but the biggest mistake , WHY do you sell your other only striker and be left with only Torres?    im saying left with only Torres because Kuyt dosen't really play as a striker anymore.

a6EndAPiaa	I believe that Global temperatures are on the rise since the advent of the thermometer.  I believe that we humans have contributed to the problem.    I do not believe that humans are causing it.  I do not believe that ice cores from the polar regions are necessarily 100% accurate indications of *global* temperature -- we only have about 50 years of *accurate* temperature readings to compare to the last 50 years of the core readings.  We are calibrating the ice core readings based on 50 years of data and extrapolating that data to show the temperature of the last 10,000 years.  50/10,000 = 0.005 or .5%    That would be like electing a US president by only allowing 165,000 (approximately .5% of the US population of 330,000,000) people from the state of Rhode Island to vote (or some other similarity small geographic area).  I am sorry but that to me (as a scientist) is just bogus.  It is just that the media does not want to explain all of that when talking about global warming they just want to point to a graph and say look.  The method by which they have established those temperatures is speculative at best.    They are basing "global warming" based on a data set of .5% of the data available which was taken from a very small area of the Earth.    In other words we do not know if this is just a normal cycle or what.  The data set is just way too small.|`|ULw1777caa	Its a worldwide scam.  There is no evidence that supports the Earth is getting warmer.|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	Global Warming is not some story "you believe in", it is real.   The argument is over how much humans are contributing to it.|`|UxooffHZaa	Science has nothing to do with belief.   Just as you can disbelieve the Steeler's 6 Superbowl rings, but it doesn't change anything.|`|9Zbh8HZxaa	ARE YOU SERIOUS?

f05463dc082c3c7c8280c54e35eada93aa	You can check that out your self ay www.atptennis.com There is an explanation of the Ranking system...|`|U7BkuEU9aa	A tennis player has as much points as they've earned by playing tournaments over the last complete year (52 weeks, to be more exact). That's why most tournaments and specially Grand Slams are always played in the same weeks every year (last year was an exception, as the tournaments in the North American HC season - MS Toronto, MS Cincinnati and the US Open had to be moved because of the Olympics).    Since the tournaments are played in the same week every year, every Monday when the rankings are made public what you see is that the players lost the points they earned in the 53 weeks ago and got the points they earned the week before. For example, last year in the Australian Open both Rafa and Fed lost in their respective semifinal, thus earning 450 points for the tournament (900 after the ATP doubled every player's points in the beginning of 2009). After Sunday they both lost those 900 (which were correspondent to the *2008* Australian Open), but at the same time Roger earned 1200 for being runner-up and Rafa, 2000 for being the winner at the *2009* Australian Open.    So you see, the points are always lost, but if a player finishes a tournament in the same phase they finished it the year before, he's gonna lose and earn the same amount of points, which works as if they're keeping those points - they **defended** them, they didn't lose them. :-)    I don't know if I'm being clear, I hope I could help!|`|NDbx9CSvaa	You need to repeat your last year's performance to defend your points. If you better it, you gain points (if you won last year, you cannot better that so you can only defend you points in that case). If you do not match last years performance you lose points (based on which round you exit in).    Before the start of the tournament, they deduct the points you got last year. Then at the end of the tournament they add the points you got this year.    Each tournament has a predetermined number of points based on which round you make. GS's have the most and then you have the Masters series, international series, etc.    The winner of a GS gets 2000 points now and the winner of Masters Series tournament gets 1000 points.      *EDIT*  Yes, that's the way to determine how many points a player lost.|`|j5fNBBi9aa	yea wat the tennis is best guy said....you have to at least match your performance in the same tournament as last year....so for example if you made it to the semis of the Australian last year and you only made it to the 4th rd this year then you will lose points...I dont kno exactly how many you lose but i assume it increases per round that you dont get to if that makes sense?

POSTPONES INAUGURAL SEASON UNTIL 2009    March 13, 2008    ATLANTA, GA -- The All American Football League? (AAFL) announced today the postponement of its inaugural season until 2009. The League will continue to build upon the foundation that has been established, and will continue to discuss opportunities with potential investors.    AAFL sponsors have committed to remain on board for the 2009 season. Currently, the League has corporate partnerships with New Balance, Baden Sports and Rogers Athletic. Also still in place for the 2009 season are a national radio partnership with Touchdown Radio & SportsDay Productions, and an internet broadcast partnership with PlayOn! Sports, a division of Turner Broadcasting.    "We are so very fortunate to have built partnerships with companies who are partners in the truest sense of the word," said Keenan Davis, AAFL VP of League Operations and COO. "We sincerely appreciate their support as we progress toward our new goal of a 2009 inaugural season."    All fans who have purchased tickets to 2008 AAFL games will receive a full refund. Credit cards will be credited and any checks received will be returned.    Additional details regarding the AAFL's postponement are forthcoming.|`|6b74083928d5741f3434bfc97282f0cfaa	Due to the economy, no company wants to invest in such a hit or miss idea that probably won't last very long.

"hey there, ref, you seemed to have missed that i held onto that guard a little too long....you wanna give me ten yards so i can sleep tonight?"  they aren't there to police what the refs do in games, they are there to play football.  if you have a problem with the refs, go b*tch to the commissioner.  i've been saying for years the league needs full-time refs cause these hacks they have doing it part-time are terrible.  to think the steelers have absolutely anything to do with the incompetency of the refereeing in a game shows your complete lack of common sense.      i knew this would happen if they won, that people would blame the refs for them winning.  how about starting a 2 1/2 minute, 88 yard drive from their own 12 yard line and marching down the field and scoring?  did that have anything to do with them winning?      i agree the refs f*cked up some calls.  hello!!! is this the first game you watched?  what game this season didn't have a f*cked up call???  why would the superbowl be any different?  i just don't understand what people think the steelers have to do with it.  wait, lemme guess, they PAY them off, huh?  that's probably your brilliant answer to why they win.  they just pay off the whole damn league.|`|ScPIXjj9aa	OMG!!!

AA10847484	Well most tracks have dorm rooms for backstretch workers.  Some of the small tracks allow workers to live in the tack rooms because they don't offer dorm rooms.  Some backstretch workers rent motel rooms by the week.  Some backstretch workers also even rent apartments or houses depending on if it is a fairly long meet.  Some backstretch workers also own campers and pay rent at a campground close to the track.

HUQMqdDqaa	Shoot a lot and shoot often. Work on the principles of marksmanship; 1 Breath Control; 2 Trigger Squeeze; 3 Position; and 4 Sight Picture.    Breath Control -   You want to practice holding your rifle, aim at a spot on the wall or something. Breath in and hold, then squeeze. You do not want to continue breathing while trying to fire, you'll miss. Trying to firing when exhaling can cause your eyes to wiggle which will also make you miss.    Trigger Squeeze -   The only part of your finger you should have on the trigger is either the tip of your pointer finger our up to the first knuckle. Many amateurs jam their entire finger around the trigger. Too much finger on the trigger can cause you to twist the weapon while firing. Also, when your squeezing pull back slow, even, and steady. It should surprise you when the weapon fires. Once it fires, keep the trigger squeezed and slowly let the trigger ride forward till you hear a "CLICK", that means the sear is reset and the next shot will fire without you having to work through the trigger slack.    Position -   How you hold your weapon is important. Many people extend their supporting arm too far forward. THis causes fatigue and is not a steady firing platform. From the standing your non-firing arm should be as close to you as possible. Ideally you should be able to support your elbow against your body thus giving you greater stability. The butt should be in the pocket of your shoulder, not on your chest. Smaller calibers can allow for you to actually rest the butt on top of your shoulder (this is a new method preferred by a lot of US military personnel). In the prone you want to lay flat on your stomach and support the weapon with something. Kneeling and sitting you will use your knees to help support and steady your rifle.     Sight Picture -   Part of a good sight picture also has to do with position. You are going to want to rest your cheek right against the butt of your rifle. Practice till you get to a point where you put your cheek in the same position more or less. Where your head is will effect the zero of your sights. When aiming, your focus should always be on the front sight post and nothing else. To line up your target you do what is called "Lollypopping" your sight. The post of the front sight will be positioned directly under what you are trying to hit, when shooting round targets your sight picture will resemble a lollypop.     I hope this helps and good luck and happy and safe shooting.|`|WBGnXsr7aa	take a precision rifle class or 2 and just time on the trigger after that.|`|kQSSz2X2aa	The same way you get good at anything else: Practice.

Long distance shooting is great fun, and a great challenge.  Start by doing a google search for "external ballistics" and go from there.

Last weekend spent 200 rounds and just got to the point of 1 inch groups at 350 yards.    Shooting everyday weather and schedule permits working for 500 yards 1 inch group.

GswnLKtQaa	depends on the situation, kobe made a noise again so teams will most likely double team and make plays to stop him forcing kobe to pass but kobe is capable of scoring on any given night. remember he scored 65,50,60,50 in four straight games.|`|AA10188905	He only shot 31 times last night. Lakers will continue to play the way they have all season. They still have one of the best lineups even with Bynum out.|`|3teWTOPqaa	Well Kobe attempted 22 shots per game last season with Bynum out, so no he will attempt 40 to 50 shots a game.|`|tY3rZSsiaa	i dont know aobut shooting 40-50 a game, i see him taking about 25 shots a night.  they still ahve gasol and odom, i doubt theyll keep force feeding kobe and expecting him to do everything.  they still have a western conf champ team without bynum, its nothing new to them.|`|yzY7W9yZaa	i dont thick 40 probably 25 a game if lakers need him to he will go off and probably break his own record. u never know with kb.|`|6sYXUc1caa	i hope thats the only way they will win|`|j9z4tGmIaa	Do you guys watch basketball?

yk4S7uuraa	The 1942 Brooklyn Dodgers. They won 104 games and went home.    Earlier in the year, they led my as many as 10 games. After the 1942 season allot of their players went in the military, and no one ever saw what that roster could have done. After WWII, the roster had changed.

AvxMhVGmaa	And on top of that, they haven't won anything in like 1,000 years. It all depends on management, not the players, even the coaches can only work with so much.

XZ4RcUHWaa	If you haven't trained there's not much you can do now.  Eat pasta tonight, stay hydrated, and don't start too fast.|`|QGU3kURjaa	breath from nose!!   u should've practiced before, to increase your lung capacity and ur strength!  shortcut is a good tip!|`|blzFIxcUaa	Find a short cut.|`|7ygTmCHEaa	Eat lots of carbs the night before, and drink Gatorade. This will give you the energy you need for the next day, and the Gatorade will store electrolytes so you won't dehydrate and cramp up during your run. Make sure your stretching and focus on your breathing .|`|1UID5JtNaa	At this point the best advice is to hold back the first 3-4 minutes- going out too fast is the most common mistake.  Your goal should be to run the last 1000 meters in the same time as the first 1000.       Another common mistake is lack of warm-up.  Get your heart pumping and some blood flowing into your leg muscles beforehand with some easy jogging, then strides at your intended pace.  The pace you need to run (about 7:12 per mile) is pretty quick, so you don't want to start cold     Always run the shortest possible distance- hug the turns and run the tangents.      If there are others running, try to get behind somebody and draft, especially if there is any wind.     Do not overdress- running hard produces plenty of body heat, and you can save some weight by wearing less, not to mention prevention of overheating.

HBK probably will end up facing Undertaker at Wrestlemania so he will be busy with that. I also think that HHH wants to deal with this on his own because it has become personal. But then again, it will be a 3 on 1 because both Vince and Shane are out and obviously Stephanie isn't going to wrestle so who better to help than HBK.|`|tACz8JjAaa	i dont think ethier of those things will happen.

The right rear can even be over the line...<br>  The reason is guys used to be cute, and intentionally block in the guy behind them..|`|zii6IWHoaa	Under green flag racing, its a pass though ( you have to drive though pit road at pit road speed)<br>  <br>  Under caution, its tail-end of longest line|`|i8soZLfRaa	Under caution, you go to the tail end of the longest line, putting you in the position to race your way through the entire field to get to the front (even lap cars).<br>  <br>  Under green, it's a pass through, meaning you have to come through pit road (at pit road speed), potentially putting you a lap down (depending on the track). Get caught speeding then, another pass through, guaranteeing a lap down, maybe two. Speed during the second penalty, they park you.<br>  <br>  Speeding isn't normally considered "cheating", it is viewed as an "oversight" or a "mistake". Do it twice in a row, it's more like "Hey, knock it off". Do it thrice it's "Three strikes, you're out".<br>  <br>  Don't know about fines..... They ususally come into play when someone is caught "cheating" or anything resembling "cheating". Fines usually go hand-in-hand with crew chief suspensions and team probations.|`|MYC6Xv1Xaa	Pass-through penalty.|`|XNdDrXAzaa	you have to go around the track and drive through pit road at pit road speed for that track|`|7Qo0hcH4aa	mole 14 is MOSTLY right, but his answer is incomplete. if you speed on piot road under caution with the intention of beating the pace car back to the exit of pit road as to not lose a lap, the penalty is then 1 lap, not tail end of the longest line. also, if you duck down pit road to avoid an accident and you are speeding, there is no penaly, as long as you are making a resonable effort to slow down.|`|l4zWHv4Daa	Most drivers have to drive back down at pit road speeds unless your name is Dale Jr and then they make him go a lap down.|`|b7f2a1f896da50f40a80adc987669ea3aa	I think its the end of the longest line...the back of whatever lap the driver is on.

However, these matches did not draw well, as they were lengthy endurance matches devoid of fast-paced action. Consequently, the crowds dwindled. <br>  A group of promoters saw potential in wrestling and began to host scripted matches with more action and flashier wrestlers. These matches were "fixed." There was a predetermined winner, with the wrestlers loosely following a script that consisted of dramatic physical feats that inflicted little real damage. <br>  Quickly, the crowds grew, and this is precisely the point when Pro-wrestling was born and left the arena of sports for the arena of entertainment. Over time, it became more organized, more action-packed, and more dramatic—that is, more like fiction and less like sports. Now it is the scripts, the characters, and the drama that people tune in for, rather than the athletics.|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	I think you're right.

wXxJUnLJaa	Really close between LeBron, Howard, & Kobe|`|AjD6Vm8Saa	its obviously Dwyane Wade so wat if the guy has a bad team .<br>   wade leads all guards in blocks 2nd in th league in steals and is tied for most points in a game.Wade is also the best skilled player in basketball. he leads lebron an kobe in steals assists blocks and ties lebron for points now dats nasty. lebron  kobe and howard have <br>  good point guards . wade doesnt he is the main ball handler in the heat<br>  Kobe sucks all he can do is score hes not good at defense Wade leads kobe in blocks points steals assist aaaaaand rebounds. i no dat <br>  u guys say dat a mvp is one dat leads his team . the heat have won more games then they did last year why because dwyane wade is the best player in the nba. also the one dat leads his team for a championship is a finals mvp not regular season mvp the season mvp is turning out to be a finals one go to you tube and search dwyane wade a true champion. in that year wade was  the best player in the nba  i stll think he is. lebron is also a candidate but he is not better then wade on offense or  defense and kobe and lebron  cant play point can they ?<br>  wade is a shooting guard but he plays point for the heats sake. kobe cant play point kobe sucks on defense the mvp is wade lebron is good but second|`|NmXKPDoIaa	LeBron, but the media should add Dwight Howard to the discussion.|`|X1f4icumaa	lebron<br>  kobe<br>  wade <br>  not necissarly in that order!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|HNQU9V6Haa	kobe because without kobe the lakers are nothing|`|A71U6gNtaa	LeBron's time is now baby LeBron.|`|jj4ZbtrCaa	your icon.

S0u3HKzhaa	I think some do some don't.I think some of these younger guys are still quite young and cocky and don't have any respect for anyone.But i'm sure some do have respect.By the way to the person who said Jericho has no respect,he is just playing the role of the heel of is in the angle of no respect toward the legends.Actually he would be considered one of the wrestlers that people would respect for his achievements in wrestling.But anyway I'm sure not all are disrespectful.I think it would be the next generation wrestlers that would ether have the most respect,or actually think it is the given right to do as the please.Although most next generation wrestlers are usually but in the i'm 100x better then my father role.But I think a lot of them would have respect for the industry.But not all I don't think.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Some do, some dont. Kevin Nash said in an interview that back in his day, the younger talent would give up their seats in the backstage area for the veterans, but that kind of respectful stuff never happens today. The business has really changed from years ago and alot of the younger talent today are spoiled.|`|1UKAho1iaa	I think it depends on the wrestler. I'm sure there are some younger wrestlers with respect for the veterans, but I'm sure there are also others who have no respect at all.|`|e3m3rdNYaa	I think they do, from what I have read it is the otherway around....|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Don't get the character confused with the man.<br>  Jericho is playing a part, but if you read his "true" interviews you'll see that he respects guys like HBK, Taker, Hitman and Flair (among others) as does Orton, though he spent a lot of time punting or RKOing most of them. :)<br>  I'm sure there are some young guns that could care less, but the sensible ones realise that they have what they have simply because of those that trod the path before them.<br>  And look at what a lot of them endured in their careers. Most of them didn't have the luxury of motels, big audiences, merchandise, big pay cheques (etc) And yet it was because of these old timers (so to speak) that wrestling gained a foot hold in the general population.<br>  So, even if the young guys don't LIKE the old guys, they should at least RESPECT them.|`|tACz8JjAaa	honestly ive heard that some of them don't and it causes a lot of heat backstage. Most do though|`|AtJXqxN2aa	It's actually the other way around. HHH has no respect for younger talent, JBL has none either.<br>  <br>  So yeah. But there are some younger talent that have no respect.<br>  <br>  Then some veterans have a lot of respect such as HBK and Undertaker, and yes surprisingly, Edge|`|BRBPDBvIaa	I doubt that.  I mean if it weren't for those veterans, they wouldn't be wrestlers today.  to me the veterans gave them the inspirations to become a wrestler.|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	I think it varies from wrestler to wrestler. I'm sure there are younger stars who show no respect but I believe there are more who show plenty of respect.|`|3o8jPdWQaa	Probably|`|n2Mod6fMaa	of course one of the biggest and most recent is Chris Jericho|`|JiCfYfLraa	yes like michelle mccool and kelly kelly not having respect for victoria or natalya(she fights like veteran). not all the wwe superstars are like that. victoria whooped michelles no good behind because michelle was being too cocky catching a attitude because natalya didnt take her lockup advice. kelly kelly that lil tramp is very rude and has too much damn attitude and victoria didnt like that either.|`|fmUGHvgHaa	i think they respect but if they dont, they should because veterans fight for their life to protect us...<br>  <br>  well meybe jerico but its just script but no one really in their real life..
a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Most Skilled: Martin Havlat<br>  Smartest: Jonathan Toews (an amazing pre-game ritual of going over the teams players/plays, etc)<br>  Best Defensive Forward: Andrew Ladd<br>  <br>  Best Defenseman: Duncan Keith<br>  <br>  Even though Havlat is a +18, he still has a lot to learn about play in his own end.<br>  <br>  In a couple of years, Toews/Kane will be fighting for this spot.  Toews has a slight edge in game smarts and skills, but Kane's skating and passing abilities are the superior of the two.|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	My boy Patty Kane - Buffalo born and raised. He is just beginning to scratch the surface of his talent. Tremendous speed, great vision, terrific imagination and the willingness to try things out there. Every aspect of his game will only improve including the areas he needs work on: namely is defensive positioning and his zone coverage. He will fill out a bit as well which will make him an even bigger presence in the offensive zone.|`|oWYs6Btgaa	My opinion is Kane...he is exciting to watch and has a long successful career ahead of him.|`|N1OnviExaa	Patrick Sharp|`|hMo9z0TSaa	Toews or Kane <br>  <br>  Statictics the WHOLE team<br>  <br>  <a href="http://blackhawks.nhl.com/team/app?gameType=2&page=Stats&season=20072008&service=page" rel="nofollow">http://blackhawks.nhl.com/team/app?gameT...</a>|`|KyaU4H1saa	At the start of the year the easy answer was Patrick Kane but lately it has been Jonothan Toews and Brian Campbell who have been filling up the score sheet. Overall I would have to go with Kane.|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Right now? Duncan Keith....in time Toews will be the best of the group with Kane hot on his heels but right now Keith is the glue on that team. Lots of great young talent so it is good to bee a Hawks fan.|`|NQkRzBtJaa	They got a lot of great players right now especially some young guns their top forward right now I'd say is Jonathan Towes and their top defenseman is Brian Campbell but Duncan Keith is not to far behind him.|`|WcLNcXjNaa	I must say that Martin Havlat wins in terms of pure talent.|`|j17vl3Nwaa	Nikolai Khabibulin and Patrick Kane|`|gVJJi2Adaa	Jonathan Toews|`|P7XbVESzaa	thats a hard one right now id say toews or kanee<br>  <br>  go hawks were winning 2-0!|`|PwED69Isaa	Tough to answer. It is also hard to compare forwards and defensemen. Right now, I think it's between Toews, Havlat, and Keith. As they mentioned in the game tonight, Keith is always on the ice against the opposition's best players, and he is +32 (I think). Toews is a great player, and could soon be at the top of the league, but some of the things Havlat has done recently (now that he's healthy again) are incredible. He is on fire right now.<br>  <br>  Therefore, I think Forward: Martin Havlat, Defensemen: Duncan Keith.|`|Xl7UHNB1aa	i'd say havlat

AA10360729	Both are stock car series. Late models are the top class of stock cars that compete at the local level. Some regional touring series have late models. Late models are sometimes divided into subclasses: Super late models are the best, late models are second best, and limited late models go slower. Late models feature the best motors and probably don't have a single part that appears standard on a street car. Sportsman are the next level down. They are still purpose-built purely to race and don't have many stock (street) parts. Sportsman are well above the beginner cars, which are usually 4 cylinders or 8 cylinders that aren't modified very much from stock (street legal).

xhPKkkELaa	Niether is really ideal for a beginner, because the ride of a wide fish is "looser' and a little harder for a newbie to control. However, you are right about the volume, and if you are working your way into intermediate, a fish is not a bad choice. I ride a custom made twin fin fish, that is one of my all time favorites in almost 43 years surfing.<br>  <br>  Now, it's the amount of time that I have been surfing, and my anti-popout attitude that makes a choice between those two no contest for  me. The CI Pod is an individually shaped board. (Yes, I know CI uses shaping jigs for the rough shape, the the finish work is still hand done). Whereas the Webber is a pure machine made popout with their "SLX" technology (which is techno-speak for EPS foam blanks that are machine shaped).<br>  <br>  Since I don't know where you surf, I can't steer you to anybody in particular, but you don't always get the BEST board for you just buying buying a big name brand. There are hundreds of great local shapers who can custom build you a stick that is appropriate for your weight, skill level and local conditions. Over the years, most of my boards have been made by small time, high quality shapers, and they are really as good as (or superior to) the big name sticks I have had.<br>  <br>  Also, since we don't know if we surf where you do, this kind of question gets better results of asked of guys who surf where you do, and are familiar with how different designs behave in local conditions. Always ask the guys in a good local surf shop first, before you trust the info you get from a bunch on strangers on line.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your choice. Fish are versatile and fun, if you van handle them. Keep on surfing!<a href="http://www.mckevlins.com/nopopstory.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mckevlins.com/nopopstory.htm</a>|`|xo5rqZ2Caa	Go the Webber MiniFish its perfict for your type of surfing its a twin fin but it has large fins and a nice smooth round board with double concave GO FOR THE WEBBER MATE!!
XTN6ZH2Paa	i have a similar body to you, used to do ballet, and have been swimming for 9 years also (im 12 started at age 3, just turned 12 2 days ago) i would say go for it, girl! try to find a class with your age group to avoid uncomfortable situations like taking a class with 5 year olds that are better than you :) unless you want to pursue this as a career, do not go to formal dance companies who train young ballerinas. try capitol dance, or to start out, your local ymca. the longer you do it, the more toned your muscles will get (spinning around is hard work!) it might be hard to start out, because ballet uses different muscles than swimming, but anyways... good luck!|`|MBI4wp4faa	Yiu could could be fat and do ballet lol ! it dosent matter. but if you wanna do it professional then you have to be really skinny|`|5RXQcCP6aa	Go for it!

T.O. has a better chance of leaving Dallas than Boldin does of leaving the Cardinals.  The main reason is because what the Cardinals had this past season was chemistry on offense.  Boldin is a break out WR and he doesn't get enough dues as it relates to his great play.  He may not be as good as Fitzgerald but the fact that he is even being discussed as a possibility of leaving the Cardinals doesn't compute with me.  He shouldn't be leaving the Cardinals should pay him the money he deserves.  He is a WR that is worth the money.  What I meant by chemistry is that if you take Boldin out, you lose your #2 WR and you only have Fitzgerald unless you draft a WR and since they were in the super bowl their draft picking will be low.  So it would behoove them to keep Boldin.  As for T.O.  he will get one last show if he leaves Dallas, and that would likely be the Bears or Ravens.  Both teams especially the Bears need a WR.
Z8UV6S3baa	Fundamentally, it is as already stated, they are easier to align than conventional sights.<br>  <br>  However, lets explore that a bit.<br>  <br>  In a conventional sight you have a rear blade with a notch and a front blade and then the target. These are 3 different focal lengths, so at some point one of them is going to be blurry at least, and possibly two depending on your eyes. With alot of practice, experience and muscle memory, having a blurry rear blade doesn't matter because your body is making sure the alignment of front blade in the rear notch is correct. Now, with some more practice, your target can be blurry and you can still pick out a good point on the target to put your front blade. <br>  <br>  Sound tricky? Well, yes, it is which is why the difference between average and good shooters is often not the group they can get at 25 feet, but the group they can get a 50 yards.<br>  <br>  So, how does a red dot help? Well several reasons:<br>  1) The dot doesn't require any other alignment - essentially you don't have to worry about having the muscle memory to compensate for a blurry rear sight.<br>  <br>  2) The dot creates contrast against the target - essentially, because it is lit up, you don't have the problem of "losing" the front sight against the target.<br>  <br>  3) The dot stays aligned to the barrel even within the optic.<br>  <br>  Now, this is the really cool part. Because the image is being projected parallel to the barrel, the dot doesn't have to be in the center of the optic. All it has to be is at the desired spot on the target. So, regardless of your other mechanics of shooting it always is showing you where the gun is "actually" pointing. When your rear sight is blurry with conventional sights, this is hard to confirm.<br>  <br>  Thus, most people shoot better with a red dot than fixed sights. <br>  <br>  Thinkingblade|`|itiLu3dRaa	They don't increase accuracy. The mechanical system of the weapon  provides the accuracy or lack of.|`|IoyJXzoyaa	Most of the why has been covered above , but I wanted to expand on one point.  The red dot does not truely increase accuracy as much as it does percision.  While a bead or blade on the front of a regular fixed sight gun can help line up a bullet, thay are often too large to truely predict its path.  With a flat shooting  round, the red dot once sighted in, actually shows almost the exact path/destination of the bullet.  This is due to its very small, and thus very percise size. It means you can simply point and shoot, and if the dots on the target when your finger pulls the trigger, your bullet will be there an instant later.  <br>  <br>  As a testimony, I got a red dot for my father in law last year.  He put it on his .22 mag and was placing  4-5 shots on a playing card at 100 yards away.  He's an ex marine, but still, do you know how small a palying card is at 100 yards away?  I guess the red dot is smaller.|`|PxrJZMPaaa	scopes, lasers, and red dot sites are not the end all be all to accuracy, accuracy is developed through practice some of the best shots I have ever seen have used steel sights or none at all. That doesn't mean you shouldn't buy a scope or laser but Don't expect it to "make you" accurate over night you need to practice.<br>  <br>  A guy shooting with a red dot for the first time may not be as accurate as a guy who has been using and perfecting his shooting with steel sights or a scope for 20 years, remember that.|`|TBAfpnmgaa	It's simpler and quicker than aligning the front and back sights.

Look mommy, look at me!|`|XLXncQu9aa	I think it is absurd.  There should be no fines as it relates to celebrating.  That is so much what is wrong with this league.  Back in the older days of football, it was perfectly fine to do celebrations and it was actually a great part of the game.  For some reason now it isn't ok to do anymore.  I believe a lot of it has to do with the league wanting more money because of their own greed.  But the truth be told the league doesn't need the money, they are filthy rich.  I think its about money but more over it doesn't help the image of the league.  It creates a static atmosphere.  It should be changed at some point but the league just doesn't get it.  When they lose more fans they will understand.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	The NFL doesn't want people doing outrageous celebrations.  They want the game to be about the game itself, and individual celebrations put the individual in the spotlight, whereas the NFL wants the spotlight to be on the game as a whole, not one individual.<br>  <br>  If you have a rule and you want people to follow it, you must enforce it.  What better way to enforce a rule than excessive fines.  First of all, $10,000 isn't really that much to a man making millions, but if you were faced with a $10,000 fine for celebrating, would you do it?  If you don't care and want to do it anyway, then go ahead, but dont complain when you get fined.|`|X8NGHSP8aa	Santonio Holmes didn't show any player up. After the catch he sat there and was mobbed by his teammates. The incident happened well after the catch and by rule should have been a 15 yard penalty. Today Roger Goodell made a statement that Holmes was fined $10,000 but he felt that since it was so long after the play and not done on the field of play to embarrass a player that this issue will be brought up with the rules committee in the off season.|`|KNTofuxMaa	I think the Lizard King summed it up the best.|`|gSgYDAEAaa	NFL= No Fun League|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	You answered you own question. It is showing off, i.e. no sportsmanship.<br>  <br>  Football is a team sport. If one guy goes out there and makes a great play he is saying to rest of the world, "Look at me! See how great I am!" What about the other ten guys out there that ran blocks and routes to get you the ball? What about the QB who threw it right where it needed to be? And why should you get special recognition for doing your job? If you want accolades, get them from your family or friends after the game, but if I were a coach, forget the NFL fining you. I would make sure that paid each player out on the field on your team $5,000 whenever you decided to show off.<br>  <br>  Then there is the fact that you are showing a lack of respect for the other team. Football is very emotional sport. No one likes to get beat for play. When someone show off afterward, it makes it even worse. Fights break out and players get hurt because of stupid things like that. No one can expect that someone who cares about their job won't get upset when someone beats them.

Especially athleticism, you move intuitively across the court, although you may improve from practicing but with a limit.<br>  <br>  With inherited talent  ?  your stage is a professional court, w/o it ?one stays at an eternal amateur like me, ha ha.<br>  <br>  Good luck to your pro career one day, and I will be looking for you at Wimbledon :):}|`|3d3d2a18b838d322464051559bd8c0e3aa	None of my parents, siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents and great grandparents (two are still alive) play sports regularly. Only a few of my cousins (two to be exact) are a fan of sports. So, I don't think it's inherited.|`|P59aCmiVaa	Sports make us stronger and healthier<br>  but If you have no discipline to train and play, you won't be top player.|`|9gscdqv4aa	yes|`|5HT9hgaJaa	Its hard to say and goes back to the never ending argument of nature vs nurture. But if people do inherit talent, i cant wait to see Agassi'sand Steffis Children in a few years|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	well my dad played soccer when he was young, and started playing tennis at 30. But he's a health fanatic so he's really in shape. <br>  <br>  My mom started playing tennis when she was 30 also, but both my parents arent good at all at tennis. <br>  <br>  Some sporting talent is inherited, but i'd say most of it is learned. Learned through sports, activities, and various things in your life. I know if i didn't play soccer, i wouldn't be as quick as i am on the court today. I know if i didn't play all the various activities, video games, and whatever else, my hand eye coordination would be really bad. <br>  <br>  And if i didn't eat so many almonds!!!! (almonds have zinc, which helps improve your hand eye coordination!)|`|AA12149254	I dunno, my parents were kinda too busy warding off communists. If I go a bit farther, maybe grampa?

S0u3HKzhaa	Lol I don't think he has actually.It is part of his heel role to call the fans hypocrites every week and piss them off loll.|`|mJvZhdAuaa	I don't think so, and is it just me or is he always using words that are usually only associated with the SATs?  Think about it!|`|lr68XuMFaa	No, every week he says the same thing, "those lairs and those hypocrites".|`|KH9bbeCNaa	lol, i was going to ask that question, no i dont think he has|`|lkw5ZyDIaa	yeah he went one week without saying it it was the week after he got on his knees and said sorry|`|yEsw7UkWaa	LOL<br>  No, if he had, he would have been a hypocrite!|`|xUsUNGYyaa	has hogan ever did a promo without saying brother or piper quoting movies all the time.thats his stik and he will keep doing it cause it works.woooo|`|TUURiVnraa	no actully he sed it the other day to the hot rod and to the nature boy a week ago|`|b0wQGm8naa	hypocrite|`|k8YSuKGpaa	nope i don't think he has. It's his famous saying I guess.
Xkm4PstOaa	In my opinion, YES, yes he is.  Let me explain why...<br>  <br>  The Rock left the WWE on the top of his game.  I could understand if he was towards the end of his career and then decided to leave to be an actor.  He was supposedly the 'People's Champ', yet he turned his back on his fans (his people)!  I was a huge Rock fan, and to have him just leave, in his prime, was like a slap in the face.<br>  To be a true and brilliant wrestler, you have to bleed wrestling!  And after a few years, The Rock bled Hollywood and fame.....not wrestling (which is what got him the Hollywood and fame).  <br>  <br>  You may not agree with me.  But that's how I feel....|`|iOICjcZcaa	I think he started off with good intentions. He wanted to be a wrestler in the beginning, but I think over the years he realized he liked acting better.<br>  <br>  If he's trying to acheive his dream, then I'm fine with that.<br>  <br>  The thing that bothers me, though, is that he promised us that he'd at least come back for a visit. Not one more match or even a full return to wrestling, but just an appearance. He never bothered to show though.<br>  <br>  WWE even asked him if he'd like to make an appearance at this years Wrestlemania, but he refused because he could potentially have "movie committments."<br>  <br>  There wasn't even a movie in the works. He just wanted to hold it off in CASE a movie came up. Honestly, that's sinking a little low with me. <br>  <br>  We put him up where he is now. He wouldn't be ANYWHERE without us. The least he could do is make ONE appearance. That's not too much to ask. We haven't seen him since he inducted his dad in the HOF in 2008.|`|f3AdydqAaa	yes, Just like Pamela Anderson's boobs, giggity, giggity alright|`|7f2GSDmqaa	No|`|DNxaK0hJaa	Rock is a sellout? Why? <br>  <br>  Maybe he wanted to spend more time with his family and stay at the comfort of his home more often. If you ask me, The Rock probably did not even want to leave but he wanted to move on with his life. When your in Professional Wrestling your on the road for most of the year. It is not an easy business to get into. Therefore, he payed his dues to the WWE and is not a sellout.|`|4OCcsDeTaa	Just because The Rock has moved on doesn’t mean he has sold out or that he is thumbing his nose at wrestling fans. the only sell-out for him would be him going to tna before wwe. and also fans should have appreciated him more when he was here. booing him as a face at mania 17 & 18 and calling him boring at the raw X anniversary show. i bet those same fans are wishing he was still here to entertain agian. Thank you Rock for the memoroies and the real entertainment....|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	half and half|`|6fbb911a92ca7ae37023cae7a3b20d63aa	No, Dwayne Johnson is Captain MARVEL!|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	No way.|`|DhUMjZxtaa	yes|`|QvcJVoE2aa	yes so is rap|`|AXn3rjEWaa	no, the rock was the peoples champion and went out with honor.<br>  <br>  he has my respect|`|yEsw7UkWaa	That's the way some fans perceive him. In their eyes,he did a Hollywood Hogan thing (but he's a better actor) and "ditched" wrestling for mainstream publicity.<br>  <br>  Johnson originally said the reason he accepted movies was not just because it was a great way to further his career, but also because he knew his WWE career wouldn't be forever, and filming allowed him more time with his (ex) wife and daughter.<br>  I don't think he thinks himself any better because he did so, and he hasn't been to a lot of WWE things simply because he hasn't been invited. <br>  <br>  So no, he's not a sellout. That's just a section of fans saying that he is.|`|XroDygQZaa	In a way he did because it seems that he does not want to have anything to do with the WWE since he has become an actor.  On the other hand, he wanted to do something else and he does not want to be a wrestler all his life.  I am sure he is grateful and i have never heard him say anything negative about WWE.|`|tACz8JjAaa	yup he is|`|iAuqXEsoaa	very much so.|`|Ac8QOD7Saa	Yes|`|tfL7zaxMaa	Yes he went to movies because they are way more money.|`|BFJKKrbBaa	yes|`|Jm8OA5Kpaa	may be|`|URKGZyq2aa	no look at the wwe right now no wonder he left|`|AA10929108	yea but can you blame him<br>  those kids movies make big dollars|`|JiCfYfLraa	no he just got tired of wrestling and wanted to do other things thats all.<br>  <br>  theres more things to do then just wrestle in life and i guess he wanted to move on thats all.<br>  <br>  i bet he still watches wrestling and he still respects the business.
Vyz5YnZqaa	What about the 2009 season?|`|fz0Aw3hLaa	Im assuming you mean the 2009 season.<br>  <br>  The Packers are actually a pretty good team, on one side of the ball.<br>  Last year, their defense was atrocious, they were the sole reason for losing 8 out of the last 9 games. they can't keep the lead, it doesn't matter how many points your offense can score if your defense can't do something. I really think that they should draft Everett Brown, he's a really good OLB, and he can bring a strong pass rush, and GB is gonna need it especially since they are switching to the 3-4. The offense was in the top ten for Points per game, Passing yards per game, and yards per game. Their Deffinsve stats were not as impressive with being last 12 in points, yards, and rushing yards allowed per game.<br>  Main point, they need Defensive players, they have all the tools on offense and special teams, they just need some defensive players which i think they will get, and i think under a 3-4, they will do a lot better, since Al Harris and Charles Woodson aren't giving up a substantial amount of big plays, and that 3-4 will affect the run stopping abilities hugely.<br>  I think 11-5 next year provided they can fix that D<br>  <br>  If they can fix the D<br>  I would say they will either go to the NFC Championship or the Superbowl, and possibly win it.<br>  IDK<br>  I don't know who they would be playing, to early to predict.|`|0Ub8hoN6aa	sadly im a vikings fan... but brutally honest i think you guys have a shot just as we do.<br>  the lions will be last with the bears somewhere around 8-8ish<br>  and the vikings/packers will be in a tight battle for first place(hopefully my vikes win) but ya.. something that may help the vikings a little bit to jump out early and maybe hold on is if you guys have trouble the first half of the season adjusting to the 3-4...|`|DWRLHK2maa	i think they need to work on d and bring favre back for one final year..find a way to get him to hold off on retirement for one more year..he will take them all the way and then he can retire in peace..i dont like the new guy i dont even want to mention his name..i dont think they are the same without favre.|`|Z4ApIxaeaa	haha Packers suck 6-10 this upcoming year|`|HNQU9V6Haa	they might go lb or cb in the draft|`|gF6pgy8raa	They have a few choices in my opinion. They could go with Raji, or the 3 top pass rushers in Aaron Maybin, Brian Orakpo, or Everette Brown. If I had to choose I would say they go for Orakpo.|`|7oZv4KMhaa	ohh gee wiz you're already looking forward to the season after next seaon.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	The Packers need to lose every game until they fire evil GM- Ted Thompson. He ruined their whole image.|`|hLOwtAElaa	I dont know who but they will draft a running back in the first round
4L8h8Rp9aa	It depends on where you are in your league standings. If you are cruising in your league and have almost locked up a playoff spot, then you should keep him. He brings good percentages, scoring, and three point numbers to a team when healthy. But if you are struggling to get into the playoffs, it is better to cut him now and pick up some help.|`|rvyvF3KAaa	Cut him. That's what I did. It doesn't pay to keep an injured player around for six weeks and when he comes back he's most likely going to get limited time. If he's still available, pick him up a week before he's scheduled to come back. That's what I would do.
4kIUh76Qaa	Yes, he will.  Marco Antonio Rubio is a GOOD fighter, but Pavlik is a GREAT fighter.  Rubio has fought mainly in Mexico and 2nd tier US sites, a journeyman mostly.  The only thing is that Rubio does have some power (37 knockouts).  Pavlik should easily win, but with Rubios power there is always a chance for a flash knockout or something but the hometown crowd should help Kelly get the easy W and set up a middleweight unification bout this summer/fall.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	yes ko late round|`|78436eac48d3bdfc1a7f6a83734f199eaa	yes.
bHheiqY6aa	India doesn't have the bowlers, they are good enough to be ranked in the top 10 for ODIs or even the top 5.<br>  Yes I agree that. But the think is, Even with this bowling they are winning the TEST and ODI series in home as well overseas.<br>  What do you think?<br>  ranked in the top 10 for ODIs is important OR winning matches?<br>  Decide yourselves. Choice is yours!!!<br>  cheers|`|AA11088802	:)|`|HSXxRjysaa	Tell me one thing,<br>  How many years it has been when our bowlers (Ishant,Praveen) made their debut ?<br>  and Zaheer returned to the team after  1 year..so how can you expect these bowlers to be in the top10 ?
UuNkAgZ3aa	www.sportsmansguide.com<br>  www.midwayusa.com<br>  www.cheaperthandirt.com<br>  www.cabelas.com<br>  www.opticsworld.com<br>  www.bassproshops.com<br>  <br>  Depends on what kind you are looking for and your budget.  However there is a laser that replaces the knurled knob that holds the barrel assembly on.  A no brainer to install.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Most gun shops should be able to order one for you.|`|TBAfpnmgaa	Cabela's. Here's a link to the mount. The laser needs to be ordered separately. By the way, if you're planning to use it for hunting, it's illegal in most states.
JD5NQxeNaa	Yep and nope they will win 60 wins, not the 67 the Mavericks won, but 60+ and still not win the Finals. And, unlike the Mavericks they will not even make it to the Finals as the Dallas Mavericks will be 8th seed and knock the Lakers out in Round 1. Reason, I see this is have you seen Dirk Nowitzki this year the man is on a mission.|`|Lxj6kMklaa	I actually hope to see Cavs and Spurs in the finals because if Lebron was to lose to them again he would definetely go to New York since he lost to the Spurs before. I wouldn't be too upset if the Cavs and Lakers played though.|`|rTbKXMMpaa	Spurs do have a great chance this year to win it all. What am I saying "this year", they have a great chance every year. They played without Manu and Tony Parker at one point int he season and Tim Duncan of all people put that team on his back and kept them in the race. A big man like him can't create his own shots so itz hard to see him carry a team but he did it. The spurs healthy are an incredibly dangerous team. They've beaten both the lakers and the celtics on the road. They are favourites again this year and whoever denies it is just being stubborn|`|uoIV59V6aa	no the mavs lost to heat but lakers wont lose to the cavs|`|Cb5N6UaQaa	Are you on any kind of medication?|`|zprMdpxZaa	i dont get it...|`|CT65FRFQaa	Lakers soft, sorry buddy you are mistaken. Lakers were missing bynum last year. Mavs and Spurs stink. Also, sorry to break it to you but Duncan didn't lead the Spurs to NBA finals alone, he had tony parker and ginobli. If you knw anything about mvp then you would have known this|`|7Ja03Geuaa	nah. Lakers are going to win the championship this year defeating the cavs. <br>  The Celtics failed to make a much needed move. <br>  If the celtics get marbury then they will win the championship but thats not looking good.<br>  spurs will not win, the teams from when they won the title are much better now.|`|YhfMrppSaa	I dont know, add me <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope SAS pull it off <br>  <br>  i dont care others<br>  <br>  I enjoy SAS<br>  <br>  Lol<br>  <br>  <br>  Hawks too|`|HNQU9V6Haa	the mavs just didnt really have a leader and they were soft and i think that a eastern conferance team will win the championship|`|ISQAWUf2aa	come on now,lakers play good defense when needed such as lakers vs cavs game we all saw at la! the cavs barrely scored!!<br>  look at kobe's dfense vs warriors last night.|`|b2qdwABVaa	2007 Mavs had Dirk<br>  <br>  2009 Lakers have a guy named Kobe.<br>  <br>  I think that pretty much settles this case.|`|ExVTrokAaa	haha jealous spurs fan!<br>  watch the Lakers eliminate the Spurs again!<br>  <br>  <br>  BUT to answer your question "2009 Lakers=2007 Mavericks?"<br>  you'd like that wouldn't you...but the truth is no!<br>  the Thing with the mavs that year is that they matched up agains the Warriors the1st round, FYI the Warriors won the SEASON Series against the Mavs 3-1 that year...then they would go on to beat them 3-1 in the 1st round of the Playoffs that same season! <br>  ANSWER ME THIS WHICH TEAM IN THE WEST HAS WON THE SEASON Series AGAINST THE Lakers?<br>  <br>  "well spurs would have more chips if the league wasn't biased against smaller market teams and didn't lable the team as "boring""<br>  -Your excuses are pathetic<br>  <br>  your the Biggest Cry baby Spurs fan there ever was!<br>  <br>  "at least earned our rings we didn't need help from Tim Donaghy"<br>  <br>  - that was 1 game and it was an WCF game not the NBA finals. <br>  - Okay by your logic then we still have 13 Earned championships vs. Spurs 4<br>  -13 > 4<br>  <br>  <br>  "aite i'll admit that was a weak argument but honestly does the NBA really wants a team from the 37th largest media market that gets low ratings to be in the Finals over a team that is the 1st largest media market and a team that gets the highest ratings in the league ? <br>  also the Lakers have won *9 chips in LA the other titles were in Minneapolis"<br>  <br>  -i think the problem is you as a Spurs fan have watched Laker games this season with the Heart of a Spurs fan and INSTEAD of watching it with the EYES of an NBA FAN. You do not credit the Lakers but simply blame the refs.<br>  <br>   9+5= 14!!! Its the Franchise doesn't matter the City, they are still the same Franshise. Get it?|`|H8u7gMAYaa	How about you wait until the playoffs to talk your smack, okay kid?<br>  <br>  Edit: I just love when ppl call us "soft". Hey, we beat your team in the playoffs last year. And we made it to the Finals. There is no way in h*ll a team could possibly make it to the finals and be soft. Sure, we got beat by the better team. But, we are more motivated than ever to get this ring.<br>  <br>  Edit: Dude, stop making excuses. You have got to accept the fact that you guys lost to us fair and square(like you) last year. You keep saying that "oh they didn't want us in the finals because our team is boring" come on dude, get real. You guys have won what is it now 3 or 4 rings in the last 10 years?  just stop making excuses and be a man and admit it.<br>  <br>  Edit: Even if that is true, it's not the Lakers fault. We still had to score buckets and get stops down the stretch. It's not like they just gave us 100 points automatically. No, we had to earn it like everybody else in the league.<br>  <br>  Edit: Doesn't matter if your team isn't popular or not. They still have to get the job done! no excuses! GEEZ
wfy3sTzGaa	propel is okay for during the meet but try to stick to water or a water/drink mix for the day before. I do a full bottle of water with a splash of gatoraid.<br>  <br>  Greasy food the night before isn't a great idea. Im sure breadsticks are fine as long as you're not eating 10 or something crazy like that. Carbs, like pasta, are also a good thing to eat the night before.<br>  <br>  As for flipturns they might just slow you down. If you really feel uncomfortable doing them and they take you longer than 30 seconds just do the wall touch and go (but check with your coach first because certain leagues have rules about them and you could be DQ-ed)<br>  <br>  The things to remember for flip turns are:<br>       -Distance: make sure you're close enough to the wall<br>       -Tuck: Make sure your body is in a tight, level tuck when you go over and throw yourself into it. It should be head first then everything else following. Remember too keep your hands tucked into your chest so when you come off you can streamline<br>       -Touch: as soon as you're feet touch the wall kick off, using the momentum from the turn and your feet on the wall as power.<br>       -Turn: Dont forget to turn back over for freestyle and do your streamlines/dolphin kicks underwater to gain distance.<br>  <br>  Charts go: Event, Heat, Lane, Stroke. If you were swimming event number #21 the Girls 100 meter back heat 2 your arm would read:<br>  <br>    E   |   H   |   L   |    S  <br>    21  |   2   |   3   |  100 back<br>  <br>  As for shaking just try and take a couple deep breaths. You are swimming a race but its not different than the sets you do during practice. Our team has the saying "its less than 120 seconds of your life". One girl on our team picks a song she really likes and sings it in her head as she races. Another repeats the dory thing from finding nemo "Just keep swimming, just keep swimming..." No matter what happens you tried, and that's all your team can ask of you.|`|896b777670a85c87e5462fd4b4dc801aaa	You want to eat healthy because that is good energy that will last through the meet. If you eat breadsticks than that is considered "bad" energy that will be disposed by your body faster.<br>  <br>  Try sticking to regular water, Propel is probably filled with either sugar or vitamins you don't really need.<br>  <br>  You're going to be nervous, but try to channel that energy towards swimming, you'll notice if you turn the negative nervous energy into exercise/swimming energy that your time might improve.|`|T9F3gILuaa	First of all, you need to just calm down. I know exactly how you are feeling.  I remember the start of the season and it was so exciting and nerve racking as well.  Just eat healthy, fruits, plenty of water, one would never think you could get dehydrated from swimming.  Energy bars (granola bars) are great too.  Good luck and have fun!|`|CEDQh6hjaa	if the cheesy breadsticks are greasy, and your coach said to not eat it, then don't eat it, yeah?|`|WiXxazujaa	You should carb up the night before.  Eat fruits, vegatables, pasta, chicken.  Good carbs. Don't eat the breadsticks.  <br>  Propel is fine, but make sure you drink water as well.  And yes, no greasy foods.  As far as flipturns, don't coast into them and push off hard and deep. Do a good breakout of the water.  Nerves aren't bad, they just pump you up.  Just relax and don't worry if you are nervous, that just means you are excited and ready to swim fast!|`|AA10214276	Eat a bunch of carbs, no less than 45 minutes before the meet, and eat good carbs, not sugar and junk food. I think sugary food pumps the heart more than greasy good. Cheesy breadsticks sound good to me. Do the best you can on your flipturns, and after tomorrow, at practice, do a flipturn every single time you get to the wall. That's of course if you're doing back or free. Practice makes perfect. Tips aren't gonna do much for tomorrow's meet. You can write the chart thingys however you like.. I usually do event number, heat number, lane number.|`|U8lG8Ltjaa	no cheesy breadsticks. propel is fine. a chart thingy is basically like ur average tally graph, and u write at the top "H" (stands for heat) "L" (stands for Lane) and "E" (stands for events)<br>  then u fill in the chart.<br>  for a more detailed explanation, ask ur coach. <br>  take a deep breath when u step up.
hK9HcAXiaa	it's all about what you're into, personally, im a die-hard bmxer, but everyone has their preferences. if you're looking at bmx bikes, id recommend not ruling out on expensive bikes, they are expensive because they are good. and whatever you do, do not...Not...NOT get any of the cheap wall mart bikes (schwinn, mongoose, next...etc.) those will break easily. for brands, id recommend brands like haro, black eye, kink,  2 hip, we the people, subrosa, premium, hoffman, fit, fbm, and colony.there is a lot out there, but my favorite way to buy parts, clothes, and bikes would be going to www.danscomp.com. it is full of great affordable options, otherwise you could go to the above brand's websites. they're full of cool videos, and even more bikes than any store could have, all in all just have fun.|`|z1Ury9XNaa	Dirt Jump mountain.

And Foley won the darn title|`|GJ9z6K1Baa	they not fooling anyone...they pre-taped the match before the show started<br>  wow TNA writers tryin a lil too hard to draw fans...im gonna turn the channel when it comes on..im not interested|`|5jIdcbyYaa	I remember The Rock vs Mankind in half time show on sunday night heat where nobody was in the stadium. I think Foley won his title that night too haha it was pretty good though.|`|TUURiVnraa	well its couse tna sucks!|`|qMM6W3Vjaa	Yeh the rock and mankind on heat|`|Hp40PucSaa	yeah it happend in 98' between the rock and mankind(a.k.a.-mick foley)|`|b0wQGm8naa	nope not the first time
Z4ApIxaeaa	right now it is Angels, they have depth and probabl the best outfield in Majors, and pretty good offensive lineup, but it would help the Dodgers case if they sign Manny but even if they get him the Angels are still better|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	In my view, the only way the 2009 Dodgers can be better than the 2009 LAA is if the Dodgers sign Manny Ramirez.<br>  <br>  If that happens, the Dodgers will be the better team, but I'll like LAA better.  If it doesn't, LAA will be the better team, but I'll like the Dodgers better.  That's what kind of difference Ramirez makes.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Angels|`|zPvxaOYoaa	i dont watch baseball at all but i have to say dodgeers|`|iwlE1Abnaa	Any no biased person should tell you Angels are much better! <br>  <br>  They routinely win 90+ games in baseball, which would be like a football team winning 10+ a season, pretty tough to do.  Dodgers are in the worst division in baseball and barely won it.<br>  <br>  The Angels are much much better, they don't have the gloried history of the Dodgers but they are a much better team.  If they played each other in 10 games I'd think the Angels would take at least 6 or 7 of them.|`|OPSFSpRsaa	Well the Angels have won more over the past ten years but the dodgers have a bigger fan base.  I personally like the dodgers better because of their history and culture and such but if it was purely stats and not culture, the angels would be better. <br>  <br>   But!..I can't look it up right now they do play crosstown series every year and that's supposed to stage the battle of who is better.  (they also do it anywhere there are two teams such as new york, Chicago, the sf bay, Florida, Ohio, Texas, and Missouri) So you can see how those match-ups turn out if that helps you decide!|`|sLVGdCOTaa	Angels easy.|`|C0KwC6DBaa	Angels are better!|`|0zCHdo13aa	angels not only because there my favorite team but have a strong rotation and a aggressive line up with vldamir n tori|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	Angels are far better.|`|fQIxah8laa	I would say Angels.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Which is the better LA team?  The Dodgers.  The Angels aren't even really an LA team.  I mean come on, seriously, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim?  Thats the stupidest thing I've ever heard.  I mean, I know they're trying to take some of the LA fans by actually becoming an LA team, but you are not from LA.  I lost all respect for the Angels organization when they did that.  Whats next, the Royals trying to get some of that big NY market and becoming the New York Royals of Kansas City?

j17vl3Nwaa	Yes a 95 would probably fit you well. Maybe a 90 but if you are only 150 pounds then i would not recommend going above 95.|`|ll2y4YIGaa	i would stay at an 85 flex for your weight.<br>  and the blade does not get stiffer the shaft gets stiffer.|`|YrhUhAf1aa	well of course it will depend on what position you play... if your a defense men you might want more flex compared to a forward. im a goalie and when i okay out i tend to use about 90 flex. its really up to you and of course with your height i would suggest a higher flex around 100 or so..|`|W7uP1ty4aa	I`d stick with 85 flex with one piece. You`ll get some whip out of it, and reacts well with wrist shots. Anything stiffer would be for Zdeno Chara types...need some muscle to back it up.

To me, I feel as though it's a little of both.  fake and real.  I've noticed a lot of time where lets say shawn michaels does the super kick.  And the sound, SMACK, that comes from him hitting in the chin, really isn't the sound of that.  pay attention next time you see him do it, he'll slap his thigh to create that sound.  alot of wrestlers do that.  rey mysterio does it too.  It's all about camera angles that make it look more real than it really is.  However, I do believe some of the stuff is real like when they bleed and stuff.  whether they make themselves bleed or not, that right there is real.|`|KH9bbeCNaa	ironically ppl dont realise that by saying "wrestling is fake" they are actually promoting and raising its stature, pro wrestling is hard to put together, UFC is way easier, with pro wrestling there are many things those guys go through, choreography, storylines, acting lessons (imprvement) etc|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	you do have a point in ufc and pro wrestling you still have to learn how to fight|`|lGO7XlyBaa	<a href="http://www.meatspin.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.meatspin.com/</a>|`|DJeij6Pgaa	ignore them the correct answer is wrestling is not fake.

I feel that since Christian has come back, he needs to come back as that badass who will tell you what he thinks to your face. Like he did with Jack Swagger. Right in his face and make his jokes and say how he felt about Swagger. <br>  <br>  The Peep Show, sure it was funny, but it was mocking other wrestlers without them being there. I think I like him better without anything else between matches. I hate to burst bubbles, but its true. <br>  <br>  Also, it is true. If ECW were 2 hours then yes, it could happen. I don't see it happening anytime soon. I mean everyone wants to watch their crappy "Made for Sci-Fi" movies.|`|uHiRCCLfaa	No, unless ECW goes to two hour shows.

I strongly believe this is a cause of ADD or ADHD because these kids learn at an early age to just turn the world off because they can't do anything about their deadbeat moms.

SiF2Ivqbaa	It depends on what kind of airsoft gun it is.  Gas will hurt the most, and spring and electric will depend on the quality of the spring.  Either way, they dont hurt more than paintballs.  And the fear of the pain is what makes it fun.|`|Ht40EPeQaa	umm yess...if its close it hurts like hell if it is farther its not that bad...lol|`|DI8kBr84aa	no it will tickle. your an idiot|`|Y4mz8BShaa	At range, no, it won't hurt as much.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Contrary to what Meseig stated, a .25 or .30 will not hurt more than a .12 fired form the same airsoft gun with the same internal configuration. The FPS is lower with heaver BB's, but there's more force hitting you. They'll have the exact same kinetic energy.|`|Jf8LiEw2aa	not really|`|268Rwp6zaa	It depends on a few variables; FPS of the BB, weight of the BB (a .28 or .3 gram BB is going to hurt a HELL of a lot more than a .12), the distance that you're being shot from, and where you get shot. Lets say you get shot with a BB going at 350 FPS on bare skin from like 60-70 feet away, it will sting a fair amount. From that same distance and speed on a jacket or some padding it will be substantially less. I would classify an airsoft hit as more of a painful sting than just flat out pain.<br>  <br>  -edit:<br>  <br>  who said the FPS was lower? I was say that hypothetically if a .12g and a .3g BB were going the same speed, the .3 would hurt more. Force=mass*acceleration. more mass+ same acceleration=more force. force=pain.<br>  <br>  Or if that's not enough/correct here's something else:<br>  <br>  kinetic energy is measured in joules:<br>  <br>  energy=1/2(mass)*(velocity)^2<br>  <br>  E=1/2(.3)*(107)^2     (I converted the f/s to m/s)<br>  <br>  E=.15*11449<br>  <br>  E=1717.35*.3048 (to convert back to f/s)<br>  <br>  E=523 (.3g BB)<br>  <br>  as opposed to a .2 g BB...<br>  <br>  E=1/2(.2)*(107)^2<br>  <br>  E=.1*11449<br>  <br>  E=1144.9*.3048<br>  <br>  E=349 (.2g BB)<br>  <br>  So there is more energy (or force) with a .3g BB than a .2g BB. More force=more pain. just thought I'd clear that up.<br>  <br>  *edit-edit*<br>  <br>  whoops. miscalculation.<br>  <br>  the final numbers turn out to be:<br>  <br>  2.276 J for the .2g<br>  3.141 J for the .3g|`|YRd5AM5uaa	If it hits clothing proly not bad if it hits skin proly will sting|`|eF60R7DPaa	if your a ***** they hurt|`|AVh088gDaa	yeah wear a sweater but NO not if he is more than 10 yards a way
SpiEasx5aa	You'll need the safety course and a license.  If you are with an adult you'll just need a license.  <br>  You cannot shoot a deer with a .22, it is illegal.<br>  You can use the 12 with buckshot or slugs(If you have screw n chokes go with the largest one you have, Skeet, Improved Cylinder, or Modified.)<br>  If you're going to get a rifle .243 of .270 would be good.  You can get smaller grain bullets for coyotes and larger grain(heavier)for deer.  <br>  Make sure you resight gun in when changing bullet weight.<br>  Happy hunting|`|8ivnzNi5aa	The safety course is a good idea, even if it isn't required.  Yes, I'm sure you'll need a license.  A 12-gauge shotgun would be useful for deer, if you expect to be in thick brush.   If you're in more open country,  you could go with AT LEAST a .243 (6MM) rifle, or bigger if you can handle it.|`|7royFhIgaa	The 12 guage will work for deer.

BbK0fA4Laa	You can go without eating anything for 3 days and take only some vitamins and fish oil. Also, 24 hours before you weigh in you can go without drinking anything. You can goto a like a sauna and sweat out all the water in your body too.|`|01cIxqiAaa	Do not go 3 days without eating.  That's terrible advice, especially to only cut 2 pounds.  24 Hours before the weigh in start dehydrating your body by not drinking liquids and eating very very very light, maybe a little bread and a small portion of protein. Then a couple of hours before the weigh in put on sweats and then a sauna suit on top of those and do some cardio until about 15 minutes before the weigh in, or you could sit in a sauna with the sweats on too (either/or will work).<br>  <br>  Two pounds are nothing and your in really good shape, don't worry.  Just dehydrate and as soon as you weigh in, grab some water or gatorade and start re-hydrating.  Maybe even grab a little peanut butter sandwich (no jelly, just peanut butter for the protein and bread for carbs).<br>  <br>  If you have 24 hours to rehydrate, you can eat what you want. But if I remember correctly wrestlers weigh in right before a fight, so eat light so as not to get sick during your match.<br>  <br>  Again, your in good shape only 2 pounds out. Good Luck.<br>  <br>  Oh again, don't go three days without eating.  That's careless advice.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	This would probably be a better question for the diet & fitness section.

UuNkAgZ3aa	I have a Bushmaster Ar-15 in .223 that is a A-3 configuration with a 24" fluted barrel.  I mainly use it for prarie dogs and eastern whitetails.  No complaints for either purpose.  Try to get a barrel that has a twist rate of 1 in 8" or 1 in 9"  that way you can stabilize the heavier offerings in .223.  This will still stabilize the lighter 55 grain bullets common to .223, however you can shoot a 60 - 69 grain bullet and expect reasonable accuracy past the 500 meter mark, not to mention good terminal performance.  My favorite load is based on a 65 grain sierra bullet that has a muzzle velocity of 2850 or so and takes P-dogs everytime I do my part.  Given the modular nature of the Ar-15 you can customize to your hearts content and get several uppers in multiple calibers and do almost anything, there are uppers from .22lr to .450 socom and .50 Grendel.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Flip a coin.

One-on-one only, if a third guy comes into the fight, he is ejected from the game. If one guy started the fight, then he gets a 2 minute instigator penalty. If one guy keeps fighting when the other guy is obviously down and out, he gets an 'aggressor' penalty, which is a game misconduct.<br>  <br>  <br>  Rule 47 - Fighting<br>  47.1 Fighting – A fight shall be deemed to have occurred when at least<br>  one player (or goalkeeper) punches or attempts to punch an opponent<br>  repeatedly or when two players wrestle in such a manner as to make<br>  it difficult for the Linesmen to intervene and separate the combatants.<br>  The Referees are provided very wide latitude in the penalties with<br>  which they may impose under this rule. This is done intentionally to<br>  enable them to differentiate between the obvious degrees of<br>  responsibility of the participants either for starting the fighting or<br>  persisting in continuing the fighting. The discretion provided should be<br>  exercised realistically.<br>  47.2 Aggressor – The aggressor in an altercation shall be the player (or<br>  goalkeeper) who continues to throw punches in an attempt to inflict<br>  punishment on his opponent who is in a defenseless position or who<br>  is an unwilling combatant.<br>  A player (or goalkeeper) must be deemed the aggressor when he<br>  has clearly won the fight but he continues throwing and landing<br>  punches in a further attempt to inflict punishment and/or injury on his<br>  opponent who is no longer in a position to defend himself.<br>  A player or goalkeeper who is deemed to be the aggressor of an<br>  altercation shall be assessed a major penalty for fighting and a game<br>  misconduct.<br>  A player or goalkeeper who is deemed to be the aggressor of an<br>  altercation will have this recorded as an aggressor of an altercation for<br>  statistical and suspension purposes.<br>  A player or goalkeeper who is deemed to be both the instigator<br>  and aggressor of an altercation shall be assessed an instigating minor<br>  penalty, a major penalty for fighting, a ten-minute misconduct<br>  (instigator) and a game misconduct penalty (aggressor).<br>  47.3 Altercation - An altercation is a situation involving two players<br>  (including goalkeepers), with at least one to be penalized.<br>  47.4 Clearing the Area of a Fight - When a fight occurs, all players not<br>  engaged shall go immediately to the area of their players’ bench and<br>  in the event the altercation takes place at a players’ bench, the<br>  players on the ice from that team shall go to their defending zone.<br>  Goalkeepers shall remain in their goal crease, except in the event the<br>  altercation takes place in the vicinity of the goal crease, and therefore<br>  shall obey the directions of the Referee. Failure to comply can result<br>  in penalties incurred for their involvement in and around the area and<br>  fines as outlined in 47.18.<br>  47.5 Continuing or Attempting to Continue a Fight - Any player or<br>  goalkeeper who persists in continuing or attempting to continue a fight<br>  or altercation after he has been ordered by the Referee to stop, or<br>  who resists a Linesman in the discharge of his duties shall, at the<br>  discretion of the Referee, incur a misconduct or game misconduct<br>  penalty in addition to any penalties imposed.<br>  47.6 Face Protection - If a player penalized as an instigator of an<br>  altercation is wearing a face shield (including a goalkeeper), he shall<br>  be assessed an additional unsportsmanlike conduct penalty.<br>  Should the player (including a goalkeeper) who instigates the fight<br>  be wearing a face shield, but removes it before instigating the<br>  altercation, the additional unsportsmanlike conduct penalty shall not<br>  apply.<br>  <br>  That's not even the whole rule, see rule 47 in the link|`|tHLMYNTYaa	The rules of fighting are try to pull the other guys jersey over his head so he can't see.  Then beat the hell out of him.|`|T9uFmJByaa	5 mins in the box.|`|P7XbVESzaa	the refs will let it go up to 30 seconds unless no contact is being made then it will be broken up|`|AA10206116	The guys with visors on their helmets are specialty players and cannot fight. Fights last until it becomes stagnant (usually when they are too tired to punch) or if one player drops. 5 minute majors for both players.<br>  <br>  There is something called the instigator rule. I'm not too sure about the full details, but essentially, if one team take a run at the other's star player, a fight cannot be started if it's in the 3rd period. It's pretty much worthless, but that's life I guess.
aYVPZjLVaa	Hate to say it but you should just continue doing physical therapy and wait until it's better. As far as I know there are no rugby legal braces for the acl/mcl (only for tendonitis and patellar stability). It's a pain, but better than messing it up again because you were impatient.
YPQTXOQ5aa	On the elite level, it would be golf because you can play forever and collect checks forever, while in football you are done at 35 or so.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	The best quarterback and the poorest golfer. Reask you question.|`|MyuexdrYaa	it depends if your good at golf. Take Tiger woods for example. Everytime he wins a tournament he gets about 1,000,000 dollars. Also there are endoursment deals. I would say football your guarnteed a nice pay check but in golf the moneys really there|`|sMjndu1Eaa	Golf. In football, you just get signed in a contract with a team for an amount and get paid every fortnight until you reach your contracted amount. But in golf, there are many competitions, opens, majors in which the prize money range from thousands of dollars to over millions of dollars and also including personal player sponsors such as Tiger  Woods is sponsored by Nike, Adam Scott is with Titliest etc...|`|739b5e09f8ab7f9b2896465ffdfbcf9baa	Depends how good you are<br>  <br>  Look at tiger. He's making more than 100 million a year (including endorsements.) He's the highest paid athlete in the world.|`|3X9OHgjvaa	Get an education|`|dHc2lN39aa	Golf. If your one of the top 25 PGA players you can make $25000 a tournament plus endorsements which pay VERY well. Also golf players last alot longer than NFL players|`|vTzeB854aa	Golf, because you can play and earn until you're damn old.. But football only during the years that you peak and the team still needs you.|`|QwCsFKLQaa	if your talking there paychecks from there sport only, then football by a long shot.
kSHQkja1aa	You should chose which one you like better, not just by which one you are more fit for.  So, since you said you want to play baseball, then play baseball!  And don't worry, if you really are up to play baseball you'll do fine, and you will work harder so that you can play even better.<br>  <br>  As a side note, you may also want to consider which of the two teams have the most prestige, meaning which one wins more awards and participates in more activities.  This might also help towards college or grad school admissions.<br>  <br>  But overall, I would go with baseball since you seem to be leaning more in that direction.<br>  <br>  Good luck in whatever you decide =)|`|fKco44yxaa	Both?<br>  <br>  And if not do what you think is fun.<br>  <br>  Track does sound best for your football, but i find track boring...you may do too, or you may find it good...<br>  <br>  Who knows (but you)
isf5gDbmaa	I run the 400m and the 200m, and i have to run on the balls of my feet.  I really learned how to run on the balls of my feet by walking around the house, and everywhere i go ( don't do it at school. people will make fun of you. lol ).  It really helped me.  You should also try getting spikes at your local running shoe store, because it will help you run on the balls of your feet, and it will also make you go faster because the spikes at the bottom of the shoe will grip to the track and you won't slide.  <br>  Work on your calves, and the whole body strength.<br>  Don't just work on a certain body part work on all of them.  Sprinters  need to have a good upper body strength. <br>  Do 2 exercises for your arms ( biceps and triceps) abs,shoulders,back,legs ( upper and lower). 3x 12-15 reps.<br>  If you don't know what to do for them, ask Your coach, the more you communicate with your track coaches the more you'll get their attention to help you.  Don't be shy asking them, when they see that you are trying to get better, and you work hard, they will notice you, and you might be a better athlete to them then some of the best ones out there. <br>  I think your times are amazing, but its great that you wanna work more to get better.|`|Nh7f8Rojaa	calf presses- 3 sets of 10 reps (high weight, youll be surprised)<br>  squats- 5 sets of 5 reps (80% of your 1 rep max)<br>  bench press- same routine as squate<br>  military press- same routine as calf press<br>  iron cross- hold weights at sides, raise your arms until theyre stretched out an you make a cross form- 3 sets of 10<br>  chin ups- 4 sets of 12<br>  eat a 4:1 carb to protein ratio meal before workout<br>  eat a 2:2 carb to protein ratio meal after workout

Stephen Curry is the same thing.  Plus he plays point and shoots all the time.  How many NBA teams are good with a shoot first point guard?  The best PGs are ones that create for their teammates first like CP3, D.Williams, Nash.|`|FlOTIfhbaa	He will probably play like Eddie House.|`|BI12HCGDaa	BOUNCE Balls<br>  Bounce IT!|`|YQLNqgnWaa	well since you put curry, i would guess it would go to food
khU8m4gxaa	I loved the Hasaan character. And he was solid in the ring. The so-called creative team failed him. They started out with some great stuff, and it was very topical at the time. As you pointed out, it still is. He could've been a main eventer, because he was drawing a ton of heat. But they got so lazy with the writing and turned him into a typical terrorist. It was one of the dumber decisions they've made, particularly since SD is taped, they could've edited that segment out that night. Ruined his career.|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	I liked him and his gimmick. I didn't agree with what he said but he's playing a heel so you know.<br>  <br>  I think he was very good in the ring and would still be there.|`|3k4tPNTGaa	Dt night what happened with muhammad hassan ws obvoiusly scripted and prbly before doin this he wud hv taken permission from vince to do this, then why he gt sacked.

They wished they'd joined as a Freshman. As long as your willing to work hard, you'll do fine. Practice through the summer so you won't be overwhelmed when you start in the fall. Usually, they start out pretty easy, so chances are you'll have a head start on the other runners.<br>  <br>  I run a seven minute mile too. It's not super fast where I live, but we're really competitive here. There are people in other towns that run a seven min. mile and win the entire race! It just depends on where you live. <br>  <br>  Plus, I garauntee your time will improve when you have a coach and other teamates cheering you on. CC is one of the most postive atmospheres you will ever see. They cheer the last runner just as much, if not more, than the first.

eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	I don't remember too many things before the age of six, but I remember my first baseball game like it was yesterday.<br>  <br>  My grandfather took me to Dodger Stadium when I was five.  If you've never been there...the park is surrounded by what seemed like ten miles of parking lot. And Dodger Stadium is actually built into a hillside, so to get to the upper deck seats you have to climb that hill. It was over 90 degrees that day and I remember my feet burning through my Keds all the way.<br>  <br>  After the long climb we got through gates at the Top Deck and headed for our seats.  Growing up in LA you get used to pavement...but suddenly there was an expanse of the greenest green I had ever seen...and men wearing pure white uniforms and bright blue caps.  It was like a cartoon.  I can still smell the hot dogs and hear the crackling echos of a thousand transistor radios.<br>  <br>  The Dodgers were playing an "Old Timers" game against the Giants before the real game.  As they announced a bunch of overweight, gray-haired SF players I didn't know, everyone booed.  My grandfather booed, so I booed to.  I had no idea what it was all about, but it seemed fun.  <br>  <br>  Then, the announcer said "Number 24, Outfielder Willie Mays."  I started booing, but my grandfather stopped me. Instead, he stood up and started clapping.  He picked me up so I was standing on my seat and told me to clap too.  "Cheer for this guy," he said. "He is the greatest player to have ever played baseball."  If my grandfather said so it was good enough for me, so I cheered.....and to this day I still consider Willie Mays the greatest ever.<br>  <br>  I don't remember who won the Old Timer's game but the Dodgers lost the real game.  I felt real bad for my grandfather but he simply said "we'll get 'em next time."  I slept in the car on the way home.<br>  <br>  Oh, and it was "Batting Helmet Day"....Not long after I got married, my wife found that helmet while cleaning and tried to throw it out.  I told her if she did I would never speak to her again...I hope to have a grand-child to give it to someday.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	The first I can remember is a game when I was about 5. The reason I remember is I met Paul Molitor and my parents took a picture of me on his shoulders. The picture is still on my parents wall. I also remember the hot dog, and thinking it was the best I ever had and wondered why they never tasted that good at home. I don't remember who the Brewers played, or who won, but I remember Paul, who quickly became my favorite.<br>  <br>  BQ: I'm a righty.|`|qivUrJ3Naa	It was at fenway I was about 9 and I met Eckersley, warming up in the bullpen for the Indians, that tells ya how long ago that was.|`|CzNxbsmsaa	I was about the same age at Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium.The Braves had only moved to Atl.a couple years before.I couldn't believe how big the stadium was before we even got close.I had no idea what to expect.My Dad told me it would be an experience I would never forget.I was a little intimidated by everything going on in the concourse on the way to our seats.Once we got inside and to our seats I was in AWE!The Dodgers were on the field doing pregame warmups and all I could do was just keep looking around at the stadium.the people,and that perfect green field.The players looked like dancers taking infield practice.How could they do what they were doing?I don't remember the highlights of the game but the Braves did win that one.I hate to admit it but as a kid growing up I saw the Braves lose more than they won when we got to go.Atl.was 150 miles away.Good thing my Dad was a B.B. fan too!I got to see many great games over the years,but the best part was having my Dad all to myself with out my sisters..who I love dearly but they ain't B.B. fans.I guess the thing that has always stuck in my mind though was the field.It was so green and smooth.The basepaths looked like you could lay on them and they would be better than a bed.I,ll never forget it!<br>  I got to see Hank Aaron break The Babe's record many years later on that same perfect field. I'm a righty and still playing in softball leagues today in my 50's|`|AA10484586	I am a righty.  OK my first game was June 18, 1978 at yankee stadium and it was very memorable since Ron Guidry struck out 18 California angels that night! He broke the AL record for strikeouts by a lefty in a single game.  Now I am sure that everyone who was there will tell you the same story, but I was the one who started the ritual of clapping when the pitcher has 2 strikes on a batter (a tradition that continues to this day at all stadiums) .  You can look it up!|`|hMkb7H31aa	I do remember my first major league game.  My aunt (11 years older) took me when I was about 9 years old to Wrigley Field.  I remember the green grass and how big the place appeared.   The Cubs were playing the Reds - I do not recall the final score..<br>  <br>  I still have the pennant that my aunt bought for me - it has been framed.  She tells me I kept asking for a "peanut" - although it is pronounced pennant.  How was I supposed to know?.<br>  <br>  Over the years, I've returned to Wrigley countless times.  I've located the area where we sat to recapture the memories  of that first game.<br>  <br>  Like at the first game, I remain right handed.|`|Lpf6Eu3eaa	Oh damn............i remember my bros taking me to candlestick......Giants vs Expos......i was such a youngster....i was standing at the third base line and Warren Cromartie threw me a ball.....i was so juiced.......ever sinced then i was an Expo fan...true story girl. still brings a tear to my eye.....i'm 25 now.

That about sums it up.<br>  <br>  BQ:  Right, but I bat lefty.|`|NP6ytPfxaa	go to iamsecond.com its christian website about struggles like josh hamiltons.|`|c6q3EERdaa	I saw my first game in 2004 (when I was 12), when the Cards played the Reds in Cincinnati. I thought that it was a good game, and I had a good view of the game (being in bleachers by the left field foul pole). I also saw Jim Edmonds' great catch off Jason LaRue and saw Edgar Renteria hit a home run where I was going to be sitting the next day. The Cards won, and I was happy to see Jim's catch in the ESPN highlights later that night.<br>  <br>  Other than the game, I thought the nachos that I had there were great. I'll be going back there when the Cards play the Reds July 4th weekend, and I'll be getting nachos once again.<br>  <br>  BQ: Righty|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Honestly I have no idea. I asked my parents and they were like "idk i forget" LOl. I remember going to them but nothing about the game and what happened.<br>  <br>  The one I can remember though was in 05' I got into baseball then and it was exciting cuz the mets started to compete again. Also Pedro was pitching (he actually played goo back then!). I made a sign and everything. Even though I was in the grand stands I was happy. I remember they VSed the Orioles and David Wright hit a grand slam. They won big. I also got my 1st Cliff Floyd plaque (he was my fave player in 05'). It wasn't an exiting game but its deff one ill always remember. <br>  <br>  BQ: Im a righty. In baseball though Id always want to bat switch hitter that be cool.
uBTPq0roaa	The defender may be full automatic but the fps isnt that good or its range. However the beretta cost as much as the defender and shoots 300 fps (defenders say they do but I say they only go 150-180 {0.12g})<br>  <br>  However sometimes Wal Mart has a co2 pistol on sale for $26.99 and thats only $7 more then the defender.<br>  <br>  However if you stay with those only 2 choices; I would go for the p32 handgun|`|4qurIEtpaa	get one that doesn't break. all metal gears would be your best bet.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  DON'T get a cheap one. it will break! better off spending the money and get one that will last. even though all airsoft guns are cheaply made.|`|7VMDF4YXaa	go for the hand gun  ..|`|Ig61vCA6aa	i would go with a m-16|`|qfbihYNgaa	Try fashioning an airsoft gun out of a straw and rubber band.

Up and down bending at the knees slightly and slowly as you come down.  Jumping is more fun then squats because you also get more cardiovascular exercise along with the strengthening of the quads.<br>  Hiking up hills on trails quiets the mind, but gives you a great workout on the legs.  There is always the "gas station potty squat".  If you can squat over a potty without sitting then you can build up your leg muscles.<br>  <br>  Peace.<br>  amanda|`|Yg1QR4mmaa	Try hill runs, it is a great way to build up endurance in your legs and your staying power in a fight.

yk4S7uuraa	Rose needs to be inducted.<br>  <br>  Maybe every fan should email MLB's office and tell them this, when they get overloaded, maybe something will finally be done.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Angry, bitter, unable to see the damage that Rose's actions inflicted or could have inflicted, and now demanding, based upon an irrational association which is just this side of nonexistent, that the pain be shared because DAMMIT it's time!!!!!<br>  <br>  Classic.<br>  <br>  Y'know, Rose apologists, you should consider DOING SOMETHING about trying to get Rose reinstated, rather than just continue hoping and whining that SOMETHING BE DONE. It really does have a much better chance of working (though in this particular case, since the current chance is "none at all", anything is better no matter how nanoscopic).|`|1CgCx1E2aa	I think that they should be banned from baseball like pete rose. Then a committee of hall of famers should review the list to see if they have made greater contributions to baseball BOTH statistically and off the field. Then if the committee says that they made great contributions, then they should be placed on the ballot to the hall of fame with an opportunity with the rest of the players. They will be still shown that they took steroids, but still be able to show their positive contributions to baseball.<br>  <br>  I think Pete Rose should be in too along with Joe Jackson|`|AXn3rjEWaa	a-rod yes. but the others no.<br>  <br>  he admitted to it asnd apologized. everyone deserves a second chance.<br>  <br>  and as for pete rose...you dont know the whole story. so i wouldnt be running your mouth about it|`|sLVGdCOTaa	If you spend years denying it then NO-If you admit it then take your penalty and move on, yes but never a first ballot.|`|5MtNumoSaa	First of all, the steroid scandal and the Rose case have absolutely nothing to do with one another. The facts in the Rose case are simple - he bet on baseball, received his punishment, and that punishment makes him ineligible for induction. No other facts in his case matter, and none of these facts are changed because a good number of players have tested positive for banned PED's. <br>  Keep in mind also that the HOF and MLB are 2 completely separate entities. While MLB supports the HOF, and the HOF does not allow players who are permanently ineligible to be inducted, this is their decision, not the decision of MLB. Baseball has punished Rose according to it's rules, and will also now punish players testing positive under it's own rules. <br>  <br>  Having said that, you must also remember that the voting for the HOF is strictly an opinion. There are no "magic numbers" that get you inducted automatically. Look at the fact that Mark McGwire, currently #8 on the career home run list with 583 (more than all but 4 of the current HOF inductees) is not in, and only received 21.9 % of the vote in last year's election. Obviously, while the HOF has not specifically banned these players induction, the voters are using it as a gudeline. And in McGwire's case, he never tested positive. <br>  <br>  Does this mean that I am hoping that players who do test positive get inducted? Not by any means. However, it does mean that I feel that Rose should never be inducted. Not now, not when he passes away, and certainly not when enough people feel that his breaking of the most sacred rule in baseball is "no big deal". And no number of players testing positive, whether it be 1, 100, or every single player who ever put a uniform on, should ever change that fact.|`|lRnk1uwSaa	Well yes ppl like Roger Clemens will never has his name restored. It was found out tht he did steroids at the end of his career (yeah im a clemens fan and yankees fan but theres no way around it he did them) anyway a-rod has 9 years left to show the world tht he can play baseball without steroids.  think they should take away his 1 mvp award he won while during doing roids and along just act like he never played those years and take everything he won or accomplished during tht time. all star appearances, hr's, etc. but yeah if arod can prove he can do it still he is okay for the HOF.<br>  <br>  i think there should be a rule tht if a player can put up the same numbers he did before he took roids for 5 years he can be in the HOF but i do also think pete rose should be in the HOF. my take is simply arod will get in cause he has 9 years to make up for his mistake clemens, bonds, etc didnt.|`|0zCHdo13aa	i think the players that admitted to take steroids and never didnt again should go but the ones that lies to mlb should never play baseball again|`|2WbR3IvFaa	Nope, they should never be shown on a ballet. Only if they admitted to the public or shown up positive on a drug test though. Those 2 are the only way we can prove they used.|`|tuWwC4Ucaa	No I think they shouldn't be in the HOF at all!

wX2tHCDiaa	Without a doubt, keep him because he has his lowest possible trade value with no team right now.  He'll be a Dodger and is likely just waiting for them pony up the cash and is avoiding spring workouts in the process.  Manny being Manny.  Unless you get a crazy offer hang on to him......he's a beast and a fun guy to have on your team.

If you can time it correctly, the punch will be cleaner and more effective. <br>  In general if you want more raw power and strength, you can do wide grip push-ups which will help hooks. And pull-ups to help strengthen your back.<br>  Other than that remember too throw with bad intentions, and try to imagine your punch hitting them and ripping through their body. <br>  <br>  And of course good technique, thats all you need. Bag work will help you with your power and strengthen your shoudlers, and Double end bag will help you with your timing.|`|18e2151919f80101e6b1310524ec221caa	If you already are adept at the techniques and just need more strength to use them more efficiently, then just exercise your leg muscles, shoulder muscles, and trapezius muscles.<br>  I also suggest that you learn how to shift your weight when you move and attack, so that in each of your punches, your whole body weight will be behind it.|`|iJ8MQ5HZaa	www.rosstraining.com

UoT86gbiaa	As a Dolphins fan, I'd like to get Anquan Boldin away from Arizona, but I don't think it'll happen.  Parcells is still building, and he builds from the inside out.  Expect Miami to continue to go after linemen and linebackers for at least one more offseason, then maybe guys on the outside in 2010.|`|qq1fSV2daa	cuz they want to get younger guys that they can pay less so then they can get other good players .. they want to build for the future but watch them get my boy Hakeem Nicks from UNC .. hes got some sick hands and he can be their #1 go to WR|`|gBfPkdroaa	harrison costs too much and he isnt even that good.<br>  <br>  i think TJ wants to be an eagle.<br>  <br>  too bad you let go of chris chambers.<br>  <br>  hes a charger now. :)<br>  <br>  haha|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	Parcells has never been a big play receiver type of guy. He and his proteges run ball control offenses that stress the run. Reggie Brown will have more of a role next year than Chad Pennington or any QB out there. I also expect a shake up at QB with Henne breaking the starting line-up by mid-season. The team might also dangle Ricky Williams as draft day trade bait.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, though. The Dolphins will not take a step back. They will still be in the playoffs, possibly challenging NE for the division.|`|U3KAgO0baa	First Marvin will either re-sign with indy for WAY less money, or retire...<br>  and TJ Has siad More than once tha he wants 2 go 2 and NFC team...<br>  Dont ask me why but thats what he has said...<br>  But dont get down on your dolphins yet, they could verry wll target a WR in the draft...<br>  P.S. they tried 2 bring in a #1 guy last year and gave Ernest Willford a Pretty big deal, and that did NOT work out well...|`|6UHMxWKBaa	u have chad pennington as ur QB and ur worried about the other positions?!|`|QlcGYKs4aa	well parcells is in charge and if i'm correct he did bring in Keyshawn Johnson and Terrell Owens into dallas, and Boldin isn't anywhere near as mouthy as those guys. don't be surprised if they do add boldin, its not crazy to say they might. he is from florida and i'm sure he'd love to play for miami. could u imagine him and Ted Ginn on the field? as far as the draft goes, dolphins might lean toward a LB and if....IF Maualuga falls to 25(unlikely) they should take him. but they might trade up to get him. if the fins take a WR in the 1st, it might be Percy Harvin, Darius Heyward-Bey, or maybe Jeremy Maclin. there's a lot of uncertainty on the dolphins off-season moves.|`|fyKSTMAfaa	Free agency hasn't even started.  What makes you think they won't go after a #1 receiver in free agency?  <br>  <br>  What they need is a very good possession receiver, like Housh.  Chad Pennington can't stretch the field with his arm, so they need a physical guy that can dominate the middle of the field on shorter pasing routes and run after the catch.  <br>  <br>  I think the Dolphins should target that tight end, Richie Pettigrew out of Oklahoma State in the draft.  He could be another Tony Gonzalez, and could open things up with his down field blocking.|`|380ae93bb2e53c346fb3d7d8764249daaa	You got Davone Bess. 'Nuff sed. lol yeah but you guys do need a good tall possession receiver.  But look for Davone Bess to break free next season.
bpEv0B6Naa	If the deer runs off after the shot, and you don't see it go down, you should wait in your tree stand for about 30 minutes or so. After that, if it was shot that hit any area that will cause death, but not immedietly (ex: neck, lung, some organs, and sometimes the heart) it should be dead by then and you can get down from your stand, and try to find the blood trail. Follow the blood trail until you get to your down animal.<br>  <br>  If you made a gut shot or a shot that defiently will not cause soon death, the deer could run for many miles before every lying down and bleeding to death, so you might have to give up on that deer, or find a person with tracking dogs and track it down that way. Also, you can usually identify a gut shot with real dark blood that smells like, you know, guts...<br>  <br>  If I was to track a deer and find it half dead, or if it dropped in its track but was still alive, a shot to the head with my 9mm sidearm would quickly dispatch it... rifle is a bit to overpowered at that close of a range and there wont be much of a head left and you would be covered in brains...|`|zifMK9sPaa	If you find it laying and u know it is still alive just wait if it moves follow it and try to get a better shot if u shoot it and it is alive but not moving it is best to just wait for it to die no need for another bullet what we did for my mule deer is a large knife and put it through its heart right under the sternum that should do it|`|LdLEDGZqaa	put it out of its misery and shoot it in a nice spot were it will die immeditly. do that as fast as u can befor it suffers to long.|`|AA10651544	Shoot it again, never approach a wounded animal, you could find yourself hurt worse than the deer!|`|VLXFPMOqaa	the only thing i have to say is that from my FIRST hand experince a 170 grainflat point coming out of a 30-30 win hit a doe at the base of her jaw coming out the top of her ear didn't blow her head apart it just put a 30 caliber hole through her brain.<br>  <br>  i dont know why but thats what happened|`|cR7Sf4cjaa	Lots of good advice so far.<br>  <br>  Dispatching a wounded big game animal is one good reason to carry a small caliber lightweight pistol - like a Walther P22.  You shoot it in the ear.  Goes out like a light.<br>  <br>  If you know someone who casts bullets and reloads - they can make low power rifle rounds that are good for doing this also.<br>  <br>  Frequently you need the head intact to prove to authorities it is a legal animal.  Or you need the head to help carry the animal for butchering.  Shooting it in the head with a high power rifle or full power pistol is gonna put it out of it's misery - but - you are going to have one sorry, miserable time hauling this thing around with brains all over the place, your clothing etc etc. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|AA11640949	To answer your question, basically what everyone else said.  Shoot it again.  If you've got a pistol, awesome.  if you have to, use your rifle. Shoot it somewhere that will finish the job without ruining more meat.  Head or neck works great.<br>  <br>  Just an FYI to a new hunter.. having a deer drop right where you shot it is not the norm.  A deer shot through the heart can easily run 50 -60 yards.  This is normal and you shouldn't worry about it.<br>  <br>  Congrats on the deer, getting one your second time out it also not the norm!  Some people go 2 or 3 seasons (or more) before getting their first.|`|b4Y0gYlIaa	if my deer do not drop right there. and when i get to em and i can tell its gonna take a while for em to die, i shoot em in the neck. i only use the neck meat for jerky anyway. if you shoot it anywhere else your goin to ruin the meat|`|1908f365657a8bfe4ed65febe8929f53aa	If i were you, i would go with the answer from DEFEND&PROTECT...pretty much right on the money, the brain splattering thing...thats a maybe..I also am an avid hunter|`|d13c4c2bb60f93e106a5ef936fc63dc9aa	They drop within 10 yards of where i harvest(ed) them.
LIKkt8djaa	You can get any bindings, the brands I would suggest for bindings would be<br>  <br>  <br>  Rome<br>  Union <br>  K2<br>  Bentmetal <br>  Flow - high end only "team and NXT line"<br>  <br>  Usually you only need to get the edge sharpened once a year, basically just a tune up that any shop can do for you for around 20 bucks.|`|HkwUGOmxaa	I like Ride bindings...the new contrabands are great! Quick and easy on  and  off. Great feel and control. Super light weight. This weight reduction makes it easier to carry, ride, or hold with one foot dangeling from the lift. I would also have to agree with flow...The high-end stuff though. Keep it light, easy to get on and off...and then the response and feel...I dont worry about my edges. It is a missconception. Your edges dont need to get sharpened as much as you would think. we are not ski racing. Concentrate on a good hot wax every couple of visits and then occasionally a full tune which will take care of your edges. we are usually not carving thru ice...just sliding thru powder, slush, sluff, push, powder...A board like a K2 zepplin is a higher-end board that has a hard base. It is going to take a bit more abuse against wood and rocks but the wax will burn off a bit quickker. So carry a rub on wax for the in between days ans pay the money to hot wax it...it IS worth it! This is a much better board than most would buy on there first go around. It is a good buy and she should be with you for years to come|`|bPGnc5osaa	i love snowboardingggggggg(:<br>  umm moosejaw;* burton?<br>  i got mine at moosejaw
LLPgGzIcaa	No. dont ice before you run. thats the worst thing you can do for cramping because cold makes your muscles stiff. <br>  <br>  Try getting a 2x4 piece of wood.<br>  keeping your toes on the wood and your heel planted on the ground, lean forward.<br>  You will feel it stretch your calf.<br>  <br>  Also, do the "touch your toes" type stretch. Go hard for both stretches. No Pain No Gain.<br>  <br>  Icing after the run is good though.|`|IWyBAa0uaa	I suffer from the same thing, honestly no-one knows exactly what causes cramps but you seem to have taken most of the advice I've heard. Cramps can be caused by over-exertion so make sure you're ready for that much running and don't rush through the schedule because running takes some times to get used to if you haven't run before. So these should fade as you get used to running. <br>  <br>  You might want to also try some muscle relaxers either in the form of some kind of prescription or over the counter. You could also get something called "the stick" it's a massager with rolling cylinders which helps to relax your muscles if you don't want to take any drugs.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped.|`|ZGelYopdaa	your doing all the right stuff! try icing before your run on top of the stuff your currently doing if that doesn't work its time to see a doctor!!|`|NkrfO4gfaa	maybe your calf just need a break or  try icing it under water or something ( but after the run )|`|lDXh0jRVaa	Are you by any chance wearing shin compressors for shin splints? If you, you're going to have to switch those out for an ace bandage not pulled as tight. If you are wearing tight socks you should try ankle high ones. <br>  Cramps in the calf can happen from not stretching well (make sure you stretch them for at least 5 minutes) or from not breathing enough which can happen when you run faster than your body is ready for though these types of cramps usually happen in your side. <br>  Cramping also happens if you drink too much or too little water, drink too soon before and after you run or eating too soon before you run. You should have nothing to eat 2 hours before you run and the same for water though make sure you pound down the water before that time.

Dont move.  Slowly back away from the bear - dont run, dont act submissive...these will trigger the attack response, and you wont outrun it.<br>  <br>  If an attack is inevitable, play dead. Go to the ground, cover your head and neck with your arms and hands if possible.  Generally, they will only bite you a few times and then probably crap on you and try to half bury you. (Bears like to eat half rotted carcasses).  But it will come back later to eat you, so after the bear leaves, go find help.

Cutler didnt know wat to do.. plus Russell had a perfect rating.. against a weak secondary but also on his, NOT YET full season for russell.. now imagine if he gets experience..|`|VBHOiIBlaa	The broncos have one thing on their mind this off-season - DEFENSE<br>  <br>  Their Secondary - They need to find someone to play along side of Barrett this year, he looked great during the last half of the season, and if they can find someone of his caliber or better, that should make their secondary a lot better this year.<br>  <br>  LB - They need to find out if Webster is going to play to his full potential this year, watching him last year it seemed like he wanted to get out of Denver. Hopefully they can get his head on straight, and with DJ Williams also on their roster, they only need to find 1 to fill in that 3rd spot if Denver plans on going with the 3-4 this year. A good fit for them would be Keyaron Fox, from the Steelers... he is a Veteran who plays well in the 3-4 and would be a STEAL in this free-agency this year.<br>  <br>  D'Line - This is where the Broncos should be spending their draft picks. Get a couple good Rokkie D'Linesmen in there who come from a decent 3-4 system, and pick up a vet from free-agency.<br>  <br>  I dont think they will be spending too much money on the offensive side of the ball, except for a RB, but if Pittman stays, I dont see them signing Fred Taylor.<br>  <br>  *** I never said Webster played well last year, re-read it -- I said he PLAYED LIKE HE WANTED OUT OF DENVER ... and the next sentence I said THEY NEED TO GET HIS HEAD ON STRAIGHT ... he is a FA, but if he plays to his potential and wants to stay in denver, he would be cheap to keep|`|4L8h8Rp9aa	Adding Rey Maualuga through the draft would be a good move. I'm not so sure that B.J. Raji won't be available by the time Denver picks, but I wouldn't count on it. It would be great if Denver could get him though.<br>  <br>  I don't know if Albert Haynesworth would really want to go to Denver, he seems to want to either stay with the Titans, or stay east (i.e. Atlanta). <br>  <br>  I don't know that Denver really needs to sign another runningback. Peyton Hillis showed a lot of promise at the end of last year, and I think he can be a good feature back. Selvin Young would be a nice compliment to him.<br>  <br>  Denver needs to focus on defense. Leigh Bodden, Chris McAlister, and Corey Chavous are available, and the Broncos need to sure up their secondary.|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	I like the Broncos to address their defense on draft day. I don't think they will take a chance on Haynesworth. He is a big ego and clearly is looking to get paid more than he is to win. I don't think that Nolan and Mc Daniels want to deal with that now as young coaches in new places. I see them looking for a line backer in the first round. The guy out of USC might be a good fit. The transition from 4-3 to 3-4 for this team will be easier than most because they weren't very good at being a 4-3 defense either. They will also look at Champ Bailey's counterpart and Dre Bly's replacement. <br>  <br>  The success of the Broncos next season will depend on Cutler's acceptance of Mc Daniels bringing in a new system. He wasn't very fond of Shanahan being let go and wasn't even more frustrated when Kenison was let go from his position. The defense will take a few years to get to respectable status.|`|fyKSTMAfaa	I'm a Chiefs fan, and hate the Broncos passionately.  But this is my totally unbiase analysis of what I think they may be doing in the offseason...<br>  <br>  First, I'd be very wary of Haynesworth.  As good as he was last season, consider this.  He's been in the NFL since 2002, and didn't have his first dominant season until this last year (a contract year).  If he continues to play at the level he did last season, he's worth every penny he's payed.  But with his big payday already in the bank, will he play with the same intensity and dominate like he did before?  That's the big question.  A huge gamble for whoever signs him.<br>  <br>  The LB Maualuga would be a good pick for them.  They badly need a stud LB to man the middle of their defense.  Their defense was never the same after Al Wilson was injured and released a couple of years ago.  B.J. Raji would be a terrific pick for them as well.  But he's almost certain to be off the board by the time the Broncos pick.  They'd have to trade up to grab him (probably with the Seahawks at #4).  <br>  <br>  Other defenders they may target with their first pick are Ole Miss DT Peria Jerry (who's rising quickly on draft boards and is the second highest rated DT in the draft) or Texas DE Brian Orakpo.   Of course if the Broncos commit to implementing the 3-4 defense, they would probably look at other players, such as USC LB Brian Cushing, Penn State DE/OLB Aaron Maybin, or Virginia LB Clint Sintim.  <br>  <br>  In the second round, the Broncos should probably be thinking RB.  They don't have much talent in the backfield.  They may also want to look into bringing in Cedric Benson, who resurrected his career in Cincy this last season.  And he's young.  I like the Fred Taylor idea.  I still think he can be a good contributor in a limited role and be platooned with a younger back, but his days as a feature back are over.  Deuce McAlllister may also be worth looking at.  He's had a lot of injuries, but he can be serviceable as well.  As a Chiefs fan, I'd like for them to make a play for one of these guys.    <br>  <br>  Free agency doesn't have a lot to offer.  Very few, if any, impact players on the market.  Mostly some decent starting talent and depth players.  All of the top players are being franchised by their respective teams.  But if the Broncs really want a DE that can make a huge impact, they may look into trading for Julius Peppers.  You know if Shanahan was still there he'd be strongly considering a move like that.  It will be interesting to see how innovative their new GM Brian Xanders (the X-man) is and whether he's willing to be a player in the trade and FA market like Shanny was.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the long answer, but those are my thoughts.  Good luck to your Broncs this offseason.  I think if they can retool their front seven and get some talent up front on defense, they're going to be very good.  Cutler is the real deal, and the Broncos have a bright future with him.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Sorry but your new GM is cost cutting. They won't pursue anyone big. If they get Maualuga it doesn't matter. A NT makes a 3-4 go. Look at the Niners their D is not that great and they have Willis at ILB. Taylor will look to leach onto a team with a title shot not a rebuilding team. The Broncos have holes at like 9 defensive starting positions, no team ever has filled all their holes in one season let a lone a hole defense basically.|`|8UTJ0kFNaa	I don't like the Haynesworth and Taylor proposals you have. Taylor is beat up and would be stepping back into the recycling other teams cast aways. Haynesworth would be too big of a cap figure and with all of the holes they have to fill on D, they don't need to throw all that $ at one player. I think we Broncos fans need to be patient a little longer and build the D through solid drafting (Shannahan was not as good at judging D players as O players). I think we should also draft a solid RB in the 3-4 rounds. Definitely the first 2 rounds on D players. I did not follow the NCAA this year like in past years, so I can't give you names that I think they should go after. <br>  The #1 thing McD and Xman need to do is decide what style of game they want to play and draft players whose strengths are toward that style instead of listening to the media praising certain players and drafting them and trying to change their strengths ( like Shanny did with Griese, and many other players).

But I will try:<br>  <br>  Started going to concerts with the old Day on Green's back in early 80's at the (outdoor) Oakland Coliseum. Saw Journey. The one that I remember was Madness, The Thompson Twins, The Fixx and The Police.<br>  <br>  Growing up in the Bay Area, I used to see Metallica with (Castro Valley native) Cliff Barton for like $5.00 back in the day. Throw in Lita Ford, Twisted Sister and Y&T and we had a good time. Saw Dio, Iron Maiden and all of the rest of heavy metal crowd. <br>  <br>  Saw the Dead Milkmen and a bunch of other punk bands back in the day also.<br>  <br>  UB40 and REM at Great America. Also saw REM and Tom Petty a bunch at Shoreline.<br>  <br>  Been to a bunch of Grateful Dead shows. Saw Phil Lesh and Friends and Ratdog with Bob Weir.<br>  <br>  Been to a couple of Bridge School benefit concerts that Neil Young puts on. Saw REM, Dave Matthews, Neil Young and many others there also.<br>  <br>  Have been to every Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival in Golden Gate Park. Those are cool. Saw Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, HotRize, Dolly Parton over the years. Plus, a bunch of others. Last year was cool because Robert Plant and Allison Krauss were the headliners. The festival is free.<br>  <br>  Went to Grad Night in high school and Miami Sound Machine and Mr. Mister played.<br>  <br>  But the best one was about five years ago when John Williams and the Boston Pops played in here in the Bay Area and it was great. All the great movie themes-Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, ET, Midway, Superman, Star Wars and many more were played that night.|`|kjAsuC6Haa	Okay, I won't ask about the Bon Jovi one <LOL.><br>  <br>  I've only been to one concert--Aerosmith. It was BAD. Aerosmith was great, but that was the drunkest crowd I think I have ever seen, and apparently a lot of them chewed too. If you weren't getting puked on, you were getting spit on.

Check out his amazing 81 point game and many 50-60+ games.<br>  4) People compare him to Jordan.... who was tons better.<br>  <br>  <br>  How many people who like the lakers only cause they are winning. If they are 10-44 next year at the break, I bet they don't have half the non LA fans.

36zm5zK8aa	and that ballpark is better for hitting homers than others. i dont think it made too much of a difference, but no one will really know. he was also in a prime age from 01-03. theres really not a way of knowing. and like giambi says, steroids arent going to make you make contact with the ball, so its not like he just automatically hit them.|`|fQIxah8laa	I wouldn't say that much.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I don't think they had a huge impact, but I do think they had some.  If you look at the website I linked, it gives info about the steroid that A-Roid tested positive for, and it's a fairly weak one, which would explain why he didn't really bulk up as much as Bonds did on THG.  <br>  <br>  The problem is that we'll never know how much they helped since he didn't stay clean.  The truth is we don't know now if he's clean.  The steroid he admitted to using no one has ever heard of and knows nothing about.  The one he tested positive for (Primobolan and testosterone) he never spoke of.  Who knows what others he may or may not have used.|`|EoAREycraa	No but if anything i think it worked like a placebo and he thought he would hit better so he did. but i think his best years were in seattle and last year when he won the mvp.|`|Mi3rHjcYaa	No diddly crap.

AA11727779	I am sick of the whole thing. Guess what? When i was in college i smoked pot twice, my dad who is a Marine smoked pot back in the 60's, my mom tried it back in the 70's. I know lots of people who have smoked it at least once. heck..our president even did it.I am not for drug use, but people need to get off their high horse.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	The weed thing?<br>  Honestly, in my opinion, weed's not that terrible of a drug.<br>  Everyone does thing in their life that they probably regret too. I'm with you on leaving him alone about it.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	It kind of gave me the false hope that ganja was an enhancement drug. The guy smoked some weed, big deal.|`|Vy8p3Qlcaa	Its wrong, and weed is illegal, dam you Seth Rogen|`|wdUFUuDpaa	Michael Phelps should have known that people are gonna be watching him.  He should have been careful.  He is now a national icon and a lot of people look up to him.  He also needs to be careful of what he does because he will loose endorsements if he keeps screwing up.  The Pot issue is really petty if you think about it.  I was not surprised at all that he smokes pot.  all I say is he needs to be responsible and he needs to watch out for assholes like the one that took his picture and sold him out.  And lastly, leave Michael alone.|`|d62c067621221ba2fcf278583e7f2288aa	I totally agree. this is completely bunk to take this stance for someone who was photographed with pot when we as a nation are completely infatuated and uncaring that the man we just elected into office as the "Leader of the Free World" has admitted to using more illicit drugs such as cocaine. We as a nation seem to be very flimsy on our idea of how to embrace or turn away from power figures caught using drugs. We hate Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire for using steroids yet we seem to be fine with guys like Shawn Merriman, A-Rod, Jason Giambi, and others. What is it that makes them different? Truth makes everything going away? While I won't take the approach of becoming a YouTube sensation like Crocker, I do agree that their are worse things than Michael Phelps getting caught using pot which seems to be a somewhat acceptable drug in this countrry as compared to coke, heroin, etc. It's not as if he got caught selling it to 7 year old kids, or he committed homicide. Leave him be|`|AA10684395	yeah, i agree.  I think they should leave him alone as far as taking his medals away.  I don't personally care if he does drugs, but he did break the law.  That's where I see a problem.  He has some responsibility to the younger athletes who are affected by his choices.  If the team doesn't want him because of that, that's their choice.  as long as he's not using performance enhancing drugs, then I don't care.  He apologized.  After all, he's not too old to make mistakes.|`|IrZP7wXkaa	I think it was definitely unacceptable.  If he was just some random guy, then yeah, I wouldn't really care.  But Michael Phelps participated in the Olympics, he represents America.  He is a dedicated and amazing athlete.  Dedicated and amazing athletes DON'T do drugs.|`|iQ3g5OTKaa	People make mistakes. I did when I was young. Learning from those mistakes changed my life. I hope he learns. Pot can cause irreversible brain damage. People involved in lifetime studies that smoked at a young age were found to have Swiss cheese holes in their brains. During autopsies. Memory is affected. Dementia is onset at a much younger age than elderly.|`|O7oxqLUmaa	I'm a swimmer, and people have gone crazy over this, and are like... don't you feel like he's setting a bad example?<br>  <br>  My verdict:<br>  <br>  Next time you win 14 OLYMPIC gold medals, you can have all the pot you want, babe. <br>  oh yeah... and the 7 world records, too... How could I forget?|`|llEMOgeeaa	I think people can ONLY criticize him if they too have won so 9 medals for their country. I think we should all leave him alone. He is a young man who did a stupid thing that he owned up to and apologized for, and that is enough for me.|`|kNQ6uRIyaa	Hes only human, but yes i was very disappointed with him. Lost a bit of respect for him to.|`|WonkKw6xaa	Its not like the drugs are helping him<br>  Its just weed|`|CZ1nO9C9aa	He already had a DUI.<br>  <br>  He probably smokes weed somewhat regularly anyway, even before the picture ... probably for years.<br>  <br>  Anyone with common sense knows this.<br>  <br>  He didn't mess up ... he just got caught.... the DUI was bad ... this was just hyped up by an ignorant media pandering to people who freak out when they hear the word "marijuana" and who call bongs "marijuana smoking pipe devices."<br>  <br>  If anything, it's a step in the right direction for NORML.|`|pckuIRhsaa	It is none of my business, but my observation is that he could have probably got away with it if he wouldn,t have looked like a wannabe gangbanger in the interviews after. He just seems a little short in the common sense department.
AA10214276	Well most likely your coach isn't gonna put more than two strikers in the game. And most likely the other coach isn't gonna put less than four defenders in the game. What do you expect? <br>  You could pass the ball back and then look for a better position.|`|MmXAXX0kaa	what you need to do is improve foot skills, because as a forward you will often be faced with this situation.  Your job in this situation is to hold the ball without losing it until your teammates are there to support you.  You can do a stepover and turn the opposite way or take the defenders on try to break through to get a one on one with the goalie|`|9a8fab24d07fe7278776e3c7c93c945baa	As a forward / striker, whichever you preferred.  You need to have Acceleration, Finishing, Heading Acc., Shot Power to be successful at any position.  I love this sport, I can talk about it all day.  It takes practices.<br>  <br>  You’ll need a mix of speed, acceleration and agility to be successful at any position.

Upubwj8Qaa	Because basketball is a fitness game. Steroid makes you stronger and bigger, not very important in basketball.|`|LGEnH7Kbaa	Well, in the NBA, why are you going to need steroids? Maybe if you KNEW you were going to make it to the dunk contest? Yeah, that'd be kinda pointless. And in the NFL, there has been cases of steroids. Look at Shawne Merriman. He was a user. But again, steroids aren't going to help you nearly as much in the NFL as they would in MLB. This is why they are so much more prevalent in MLB.|`|wf3S2avqaa	Who cares? I mean really. That's whats wrong with the world today people need to worry about they're own lives and stop worrying about Tom, dick and harry. As long as you arent using steriods don't worry about it.|`|Vr4r5l8Raa	MLB is da most boring sports ever, sad to say that many stu*** people likes dis s***.|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	I don't know but I'm pretty sure LeBron has used steroids.|`|u2QhQAxzaa	Well, the NFL has had some steroid users (Shawne Merrimen) but it is not as prevalent than in the MLB.  Because in baseball, steroids help to improve natural power over a short burst. Like throwing a pitch or swinging a bat.  The steroid helps make the body push that burst and therefore, steroids are more popular.  In sports like Basketball, you don't need to be super strong.|`|50bEHtYfaa	It did hit the NFL last year. 6 players were caught using steroids. NBA i don't think many use them, though it may look like some do. But I think the media is making to big of a deal of A-Rod. They need to leave him alone, he admitted to it unlike Bonds and appologized. Not to mention he did this in 03-04. That is 5 years ago, thats the past, who cares!? They need to move on and go back to covering regular sports stories and lay off of A-Rod.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Well, as for NBA, why would players risk it?  You don't really gain a whole lot that would help you in basketball.  I mean, basketball isn't a game of pure strength, its about precision and coordination.  While baseball players can hit more home runs what's the extra strength going to do in the NBA?  If anything it might make them less agile which would actually be counterproductive.  One PED that players in the NBA may use, however, would be EPO.  It helps endurance and basketball players, especially your stars who you want to be out there as much as possible, could be tempted to use something that greatly boost endurance, though, since no professional sports league other then the NFL tests for it, we'll likely never know.<br>  <br>  As for the NFL, they have much stricter testing policies to keep steroids out.  They choose 10 random players per team per week to undergo tests, and its completely random.  Its harder to get away with it in the NFL, so less players actually try it.|`|j6NImFHgaa	It has hit the NFL a few times. But yeah you are probably right, I think there could be a lot more users in the NFL, NBA, and MLB. But you know they are going to probably bust someone really soon, just watch. They always find some kinda way.|`|adM9rI7Faa	cuz steriods wont be of any use in the nba are they gonna make u shoot better or somethin? NO and in the nfl their really strict about the substance abuse policy and they have like tests every month n stuff|`|1ieKW07Naa	It'll come, soon..
bpm8N49Oaa	If you do the glide properly you can see a 5 -7 foot increase.  Check out the internet for videos on glide technique.  I coach throwers and good gliders can throw very well.  Just remember to build your core strength.  Goord throwers throw from their core not their shoulders or arms.|`|PJp5S6e2aa	Start at the front of the circle with your left foot next to the toe board (assuming you are right-handed) and your left shoulder pointed toward the throwing area. Work on jumping and doing a half-turn in the air, landing with your right foot where your left foot started, which will put your right shoulder closest to the throwing sector.  Once you are comfortable with that, move back one step from the toe board (still with left foot forward).  Raise your left leg, pull it toward the toe board (this will make you hop on your right foot) and repeat what I wrote earlier.  If you are having problems understanding please email me and I will try to explain things better.|`|ySwnTzdsaa	Eh, check out the links, I used to throw, never enjoyed it much.

8QUF659maa	It depends on a number of things. If you are near hundreds of ranges it will be cheaper and if there isn't one for miles and miles it will most likely be more costly. Amenities that the range offers is also a factor. <br>  <br>  Id say between $3 - $10 for a small bucket to $6 - $18 for a large bucket. <br>  <br>  Sometimes they also charge by the half hour or hour.|`|Wa7wktLkaa	5 - 10 dollars for a bucket (about 70 - 80 balls)|`|l4pVsxoraa	Where I go it's $4 for a warm up bucket (40 balls) $8 for a medium (about 70 balls) and 10 for a large (about 100 balls).|`|YPQTXOQ5aa	I go to a course that I can practice my chipping and putting all day for $7.00 and then they give me a bucket of balls (about 50) for the driving range.<br>  <br>  I have seen prices from $3.00 to $10.00 for a good size bucket of balls|`|syzMIfLLaa	in oklahoma it is pretty much $5 for a large bucket, everywhere.  but i'm sure in other areas it changes|`|RIw8iITtaa	Here in NJ it ranges from about 5 to 10 dollars depending on the size of  the bucket of balls.|`|oaw7ssT7aa	idk it depends where you are
isf5gDbmaa	I run the 400m and the 4x400m relay, i personally love it to death. I also run the 100m. THe 400m seems like a long race, but if you run it right its not bad at all.  When running the 100m you just go all out, and when you are done there should be nothing left of you, but when you first start its not like that at all.  THe same goes for the 400m.  <br>  Break it down to 4 sections ( 100 each).  Pretend like its your worm up for the 100m. Do not worry about the distance.  HAVE A POSITIVE ATTITUDE AT ALL TIMES.  do not waist your energy,by saying you can't do it. Be proud of yourself by finishing.   <br>  1st 100m - Go at a nice medium pace, but not a jog ( about50%)<br>  2nd 100m - Go a little bit faster ( about 65%)<br>  3rd 100m - Go faster (about 85%)<br>  4th 100m - Go all out like you do at your 100m race, and do not worry about anything else.<br>  After you are done do not sit down, walk around, for a while.  DRINK LOTS OF WATER.<br>  Good luck. Hope you like the 4x400m.|`|kJDWy3biaa	What you have to do is not use up all of your energy in the beginning of the race! This is key in races such as the 300 and 400 in particular, but you are most likely prone to using up all of your energy in the beginning of the races you compete in, because you just are built that way. Well, there's good news. As long as you don't use up all of your strength in the very start of the race, there is hope that you will have enough speed left to sprint the last leg of the race, the last and infamous 100m. This is how you are going to not get last, and get better. You have to go out running hard, but not too hard, like you normally would in a 100m event. You pick a person who you know you can get ahead of later in the race, and when the time comes, during the last 200 or 100m of the race, you pass (or at least attempt to pass) that person and maybe even the person ahead of that person. Before you know it, you've won the race, or rather, since you are in a relay, gotten ahead of the other teams competing in te 4x400m relay and put your team in a good position, a good standing in the end. Good luck, and remember, the fact that you need to save as much energy as you possibly can for the last 200m to 100m of the race so you can sprint until the finish is key! Good luck, and I hope you like this advice.|`|DjQQosqjaa	Run the race like this...<br>  The first 100 meters, Run at 94-96 Percent, The next 150, run at 92-93 percent. This way, for your last 150, while you will be tired, you will not be completley running on an empty tank as if you were to try and run the whole thing at 100%...<br>  Run the last 150 at 100% leaving absolutley nothing left... Leave it all on the track...<br>  Good luck!|`|lDXh0jRVaa	You'll do it because you HAVE to do it. Just give it your all. I was a discus thrower and my coach made me run a 400 or 800 every meet! I had a lot of muscle on me so it was so hard to run that far that fast! I always came in last but at least I tried and kept my coaches happy.|`|J6xmZqj1aa	It is the beginning of the season and you need to work on your base, even sprinters need relative endurance.

Big difference.|`|KFs7hWP9aa	I'm the guy who looks at the pitch speed after almost every pitch - I gotta say 90 for most starters, 92 for most closers, and probably 82-85 for middle relievers.

The 270 has a lot more recoil.* You would get a lot more use out of the 270 than the 44 Magnum.* I would rather have a 270.*|`|AA10651544	One is no better than the other in the thick stuff, only the 44 is usually chambered in lighter faster handling guns which can be a plus. If you hit a branch with either you will likely miss or worse cripple an animal, they don't buck brush.<br>   Inside 150 yds there isn't any real advantage to either, but If you can see to shoot beyond that the 270 will leave the 44 to shame. I have both and carry which ever I feel is right for the terrain I'll be hunting.|`|tkTkVw0Raa	I'm from Missouri and we have lots of woods as well as feilds.  Its true that a 44 will kick less but a 270 has much more pros.  Rounds are easy to find if you want specialty rounds. Myself I shoot a 270 and just killed I nice 11 point this season that was standing behind a little brush had no problem with it.  270 will also shoot flatter(faster) so long distance shots are reasonable.|`|FhuXtF4haa	A .270 is a lighter bullet that is good for hunting in farmland and open areas. A .44 mag is a heavy round that acts like a slug in the fact that it will just keep humming along if it hits anything. In review GET A .44 MAG|`|lT8MEI6Raa	Since the .44 mag is heavier, it is less likely to get knocked off course by the brush. The .270 is more for open shooting|`|zifMK9sPaa	The 270 is a great gun that u can use almost everywhere in the world a little bit larger kick but if you get a nice heavy barrel put on it u can use that gun for life|`|8oY6C3yBaa	Do one better.

Just make it clear to the team that you're not going to be their watergirl/slave.<br>  <br>  Any experience that you can grab with that team will probably turn out to be just what you wanted.|`|o1B8obliaa	no don't do it, you'll just be feeling pretty pissed off every time you're there because it's not what you had intended to do in the first place. Find something else for you community hours that you'll enjoy as well as another place to play volleyball where you'll be happy with the people there. You're better off like that, don't mind things didn't go as planned. Look at it this way, would you want to play with people that suck so that you get your asses kicked by the other teams?? trust me you don't want that

So you are only .39 slower than the fastest player in the NFL?  Not likely....|`|7oZv4KMhaa	I ran a 4.8 my frosh year|`|qsKOlpUyaa	Watch the combine. Look up the stats after it's over. Notice how fast those OLinemen are, 5.3, 5.4. A 5'6", 140 lb sophomore will never run a 4.4. Unless your girl friend, 9th grade, is a top track sprinter, she won't run a 5.6. My guess is your sophomore time will be 5.5 -5.6. What difference does your start make? You start when you want to.|`|LerNCpIJaa	For a high schooler, under 5 seconds is decent. Being in that 4.6-4.7 range is pretty elite; the fastest guy I remember in high school ran a 4.5 as a senior, he was like 5'10"-ish and probably 170....I can't remember him too well it was a while ago. But yeah, 4.4 is really fast, even for college. Good luck.|`|sUAaeqlHaa	If you can run 4.4 as a sophomore then I think I'd have to call B.S!! If you really can, that is incredible. I never ran faster than a 4.65 and people acted like I was some kind of speed freak.<br>  Depending on your size, I'd guess average would be about 4.8 for the smaller guys to 5.5 for a 300 lb. lineman.|`|DUynNDfNaa	id say like 5-6s<br>  <br>  but you say you got timed a 4.7 hand timed international track rules say you should add .24 to all hand times  so in reality you run 5.0 40 at best.|`|U7oDXHglaa	is this michael edmunds?
7205d25da3a12d6568b00d8e6de5b56baa	There are 'open tryouts' occasionally and, yes, they are difficult.
8X9IYJIMaa	Ok appearence doesnt matter lol. Depending on your school they should teach you how to stunt at tryouts...our school did. There also looking for good jump technique (practice doing V-lifts) and the loudness and depth of your voice. For stunut wise though, depending on how much you weigh you u could possibly b a flyer and they'll train you on how to fly. Also at tryouts they'll  teach you a dance and a cheer so just make sure ur a quick learner with that. And motions are verrrrrryyyyyyy important. DONT be sloppy, that WILL mess u up. Just practice hitting your motions strong and tight. So dont sweat it, a cheerleader can always be made :) you'll do great! :) hope i helped!!|`|BjGWvE43aa	Well I think that you should get into some type of cheerleading wile you can, and mabye some dance lessons and tumbling, beacuse all that will help you for cheerleading and you also want to know some stuff before you go and tryout, beacuse if you know nothing you will probably not make it, so you want some experiance. your only 13 you have some years before high school so really practice alot!|`|Yf5RM12aaa	get skinny and blonde|`|ZptH0DUxaa	Required tumbling skills will depend on your schools.  In some schools, because most of the girls can do a backhandspring, it will be required.  In other schools, a standing tuck may be required.  In other schools, there may be no required tumbling, but doing moves will help your scores.<br>  <br>  Don't throw anything you can't pull off at least 90% of the time.<br>  <br>  Smile (vaseline on your gumline works wonders)!<br>  <br>  Be loud and crisp with your movements and your voice.<br>  <br>  Hit each individual move.<br>  <br>  Have a positive attitude at all times during the workouts. I cannot tell you how many times girls lose points because I notice attitude problems during the workouts for tryouts.<br>  <br>  Good luck! I hope you do well!

I would suggest adding in other types of conditioning, ie. running stairs, 100s,200s,. Also you can condition with weights which no one ever thinks about, if you pair up exercises 3-5 of them and do them back to back no rest as one set and rest for 2 min between each you will get conditioned.
4L8h8Rp9aa	I would take Yovani Gallardo. He is coming off of an ACL injury, but did return before the end of last season, so he should be ready to go this year. A lot of people forget how dominant he was before he got hurt, he is a young guy with plenty of upside, he will get you a low ERA and high strikeouts.<br>  <br>  Rich Harden might be the most talented pitcher on the list, but he is very injury prone. A.J. Burnett gets a lot of strikeouts, but his WHIP and ERA are always high. Adam Wainwright is decent, but he doesn't get a whole lot of strikeouts.|`|PbNcLBbqaa	Probably Nolasco... he had a very good season last year under the radar, and Burnett and Harden are big time injury risks.|`|Dr7CwhG0aa	I would take Burnett. Burnett performs great as the number two pitcher on the staff. He won 18 games and fanned 231 batters behind Roy Halladay. Last year he didn't land on the DL once which is a good sign.He now has all the pressure off him with Sabathia taking most of the pressure on the staff.

EGe0k8P6aa	This gun has a claimed muzzle velocity of 350 fps with 5 grain BBs. That works out to 1.36 ft-lbs of muzzle energy. To kill mice, rats, or sparrows you need 2 ft-lbs of impact energy. To kill pigeons, starlings, and squirrels you need 3 ft-lbs of impact energy. To kill rabbits you need 5 ft-lbs of impact energy. The gun you asked about doesn't produce enough energy to kill any of these animals humanely. Its a target pistol not a hunting airgun.<br>  <br>  If you want to hunt small game animals with an inexpensive airgun, look at the Crosman 2100 (9 ft-lbs of muzzle energy) or the Daisy 880 (7.86 ft-lbs of muzzle energy). Both of these guns have enough energy to kill squirrels out to 25-30 yards and rabbits out to 20-25 yards. Or you could look at the Benjamin 392, Daisy 22SG, Crosman 2260, or any of the spring piston hunting rifles which will stretch those ranges a bit further.|`|fUDlbOP0aa	BB guns are for target and paper targets. they are not for hunting anything at all. Pellet guns can be used for hunting very small game animals or eliminating pests. BB guns are not pellet guns. <br>  <br>  but if you decide to ignore that, you can probably exterminate small birds, crows, squirrels, rats, etc similar small animals. It won't be hunting. it'll be pumping them full of BBs until they die.

KMASS2Gmaa	It means that you have a choke system with interchangeable chokes. Chokes vary the shot pattern from very spread to fairly narrow.  see the following explanation it should clear all  questions.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mossberg.com/content.asp?ID=499&section=safety" rel="nofollow">http://www.mossberg.com/content.asp?ID=4...</a>|`|YrxLbfiIaa	You can fire anything thru that barrel.... I do suggest if you plan on shooting lots of slugs thru it that you change the choke to an "Improved cylinder" choke... Its a more open choke and is better suited for slugs....<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cdnninvestments.com/mo50012imcyc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdnninvestments.com/mo50012im...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wholesalehunter.net/mfgs/Mossberg.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wholesalehunter.net/mfgs/Moss...</a>|`|K5AeQuSNaa	You can fire any shotgun shells through it that are the correct gauge and length.  You barrel should say what that it.  If you have a 12 ga., it should say something like "12ga, 2 3/4 inch and 3 inch shells".  The maverick is just a mossberg 500 without any frills.  You can shoot any kinds of shotgun shells you want.  Slugs are fine with that choke, but if you are planning on shooting them often, you could probably go to an Improved Cylinder (IC) choke when you can afford it.  It is a bit larger, so the slug will deform less as it goes through, hence gives you a bit better accuracy.  It should also kick a bit less with slugs that way.  And for the record, you don't need to go get any other shotgun.  All of the regular mossberg 500 parts fit it, and it will last you for decades.  Good luck, and have fun.|`|QfvmFbVSaa	I will answer this as simple as possible<br>  YES,  yes you can and the accu choke just means that the end of the gun barrel is a choke insert that screws in to make the shot patter tighter or looser but the one yu have in the gun is alows a pretty big pattern to go through and even though they say its not good for the gun, I have shot slugs for years out of mine and i have the same gun, I kiled 2 deer with mine this year using it|`|ktMefP0oaa	any shotgun can fire slugs through it, although rifled barrels can be bought to make it more accurate when it is intended for that use, a one tube accu-choke is nothing more than a modified tube that stays on the end of the barrel and accepts the various chokes in the set quickly changing the pattern of shot.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Well, if the barrel is not rifled and a smoothebore than you can fire anything through it. It it's rifled then shotgun shot should be avoided.
cd8fb1a8552a48786a6354cd99f5f249aa	wow, just searched about it and seems very interesting, i'll read more on it but my idea is if you're willing to go into it then go ahead, i would certainly consider it, looking at the different aims and objectives that this program gives.<br>  <br>  only you need to have graduated from a 4-year program in a university with high grades and it's better if you had a couple of years of working experience, preferably management and sports related, your motivation to sports management should be high and clearly explained in your application/interview.<br>  <br>  but still, it's a nice course for those who are hard working and willing to do something that they enjoy.

obPSaYf3aa	Yes, because I'm not letting the media stained steroid issue destroy my ability to enjoy a day at the ballpark.  Steroids don't help with baseball performance other than helping injuries heal faster and providing some energy and stamina, but not helping you hit the ball far or pitch a 100+ mph. fastball the entire game.<br>  <br>  I purchase only MLB licensed "authentic" jerseys of various team's players, even though I'm a Giants & A's fan, have been since the early 1970's and really enjoy ballpark fare whenever I travel to away games.<br>  <br>  Win or lose, whenever the SF Giants or A's play, is lots of fun attending games because we're blessed to have two MLB teams within only 8 miles of each other.<br>  <br>  I also have corporate season tickets for both teams in SF and Oakland, which basically means I'm at the ball park probably 100 days out of the year enjoying a game, and watching on DirecTV when they have away games.|`|c6q3EERdaa	I consider myself a big baseball fan.

k9IFYBDQaa	Lebron James|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	The Browns have Winslow and Edwards. The only problem they have on offense is the RB position. Lewis is old. He can't be expected to run the ball 80% of the time. They should be able to get Moreno or Beanie Williams. They might be able to wait to the second round to get another running back at less money. The biggest thing they need is a defense. With McGinest leaving, they need to help their pass rush. Orakpo out of Texas might be good for them. Their is also the kid out of San Jose State, Gilbert.

He'd start immediately at OLB.  THe Browns need a talent infusion on their front seven.  Also, the defensive tackle from Boston College BJ Raji would be an excellent choice.  He could start immediately anywhere on their three man line.  He's massive enough to play a two gap scheme, and has the quickness and athletic ability to penetrate.|`|AA11071692	5th pick in the draft, lots of good choices here, depends who falls to them.

bOaZUcJsaa	i didn't know Kerry Collins made the pro-bowl which was definitely wrong. I do think Aaron Rodgers is underrated and so is Kyle Orton. I think the most overrated players are Tom Brady and Carson Palmer. Tom Brady never would have won anything without Adam Vinatieri and their defense. I mean look at this season they almost made the playoffs with a quarterback who never played in the NFL before. Carson Palmer has never accomplished anything except earning a 3 seed in the playoffs.|`|gBfPkdroaa	wow jaddai29RB.<br>  <br>  well <br>  <br>  overrated-<br>  Terrel Owens/Chad Johnson-the two most overrated WR in the game today.<br>  <br>  Underrated-<br>  Aj otogawe (idk how to spell his name but its a safety from the rams)<br>  he gets no recognition cause the team he plays for sucks.<br>  <br>  Tj housmezdah (the WR from the bengals)|`|FHjZuEhQaa	Overated <br>  <br>  QB Eli manning<br>  HB LT<br>  FB who cares<br>  WR TO<br>  OL Flozel Adams<br>  <br>  LB Zack Thomas<br>  CB Ronde Barbr / Antonio Cramarte<br>  S Darren Sharper / Bob Sanders<br>  <br>  <br>  Underated<br>  <br>  QB David Garrard<br>  HB Steve Slaton<br>  WR so many ill just pick my fav Lance Moore<br>  OL Ryan Clandy<br>  <br>  LB Jonathan Vilma (questionable)<br>  CB Dominque-Rogers Cramartie<br>  S Jermaine Philips/ OJ Atogwe|`|nltFZcuGaa	overrated- darren sproles. the colts suck at stopping the run end of story.<br>  Anquan Boldin- he just sucks.<br>  Zach Thomas- hasnt done anything special in like 3 years<br>  Underrated- Mushin Muhammad.

He only won one ring, and it was by his offensive line and defense, but he was supposedly better than Peyton Manning after that. What the hell? Peyton Manning is a first-ballot hall of famer even if he retires now. He had one good season and a good team and you call him a Hall of Famer?<br>  <br>  Kerry Collins was invited to the Pro Bowl because he wins games. People rate him the same way they rate Ben Rothelisberger, but I agree. Kerry Collins is overrated.<br>  <br>  As for Phillip Rivers, I think he is rated just fine. Remember, pro bowl players are decided through voting, he's a douchebag and NFL fans won't forget that just yet.|`|rPFJ3saYaa	overated- eli manning, matt hasselbeck, tony romo<br>  <br>  underated- shaun hill, jay cutler, aaron rodgers<br>  <br>  as far as qb's are concerned.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Eli Manning as underrated?  Are you serious?  I mean, its your opinion, but look at his stats.  He has a career QB rating of 76.1.  This season was the only time he was below 15 picks.  Last season he was at 20.  If his last name wasn't Manning, he would be the equivalent of Tyler Thigpen.  He had the best season of his career last year, but everyone wanted to make him the second coming of god after he won the SB in a season he threw 20 picks and was the #25th rated QB in the league.<br>  <br>  That brings me to the most overrated player, this seasons #24th rated passer (25 last year, 24 this year, pattern of poor QBs winning the SB) Ben Roethlisberger.  Its borderline as to who's more overhyped, Ben or Eli.  Ben is not that good, he just has a great team and a great D.  I know he won 2 SBs, but even Trent Dilfer won, doesn't mean he's good.  If you look at his first SB win, I could have played better, but they won anyway.  <br>  <br>  Kerry Collins - I agree, I don't think being #23 in the league is deserving of a pro bowl spot, but its kinda the same with Roethlisberger, you play for a good team and people think youre good.  <br>  <br>  Matt Cassel - If ever a player was overrated, its Cassel.  I mean, many people want to look at the fact he put up some good numbers this season and led the Patriots to a winning season.  But the reality is that his stats were helped by having a great WR tandem and a team that wants to pass more than run.  And he took a 16-0 team to 11-5 and missing the playoffs.  Everyone who thinks he could be the savior of another franchise is in for a big surprise should they trade for him.<br>  <br>  Aaron Rodgers - I don't know if I'd really call him underrated, as I know a lot of people who do consider him a good QB, and his stats prove it.  He did have a good year and there was nothing more he could have done for the Pack with the team they had.  <br>  <br>  Philip Rivers - There are plenty of people who bash on him, but theres no question that he has talent.  He was the top rated QB by a sizeable margin, and he's a great player, easily the best QB in that draft class that included Ben and Eli.|`|9Zbh8HZxaa	Overrated : L.T.<br>  Underrated : Dwight Freeney - Peyton Hillis - Dwayne Bowe

You can finish 20th and make more money than the poor slob making $10.00 an hour month in and month out.|`|sS5abD8Vaa	I doubt it .|`|4j7rodV2aa	I think he's got a great chance because of the format. Instead of playing the whole field at one time and for 72 holes. It's a 1 on 1 hole by hole match. And despite what other players say, if you're paired up against Tiger in this format, I have to think they're still a little scared. I hope he does win. The Tour needs him back bad and after all he IS Tiger Woods...anytime he tees it up, he's got a chance to win!|`|syzMIfLLaa	I think he has a slightly worse chance to win than he did any other time he has teed it up.  not because of the knee, i think he will be better than ever sooner than not, but just because he hasn't competed in 9 months.  That has got to be the longest lay off since he was like two.  He said the knee has been bad for 10+ years, so he has to be improved from last year, once he gets back in the "swing" of things.

RyZHhI6aaa	I think this just depends on your betting style.  The guys on TVG are always banking on the big payout and there are people who won't bet if the odds are too low... they'll wait days or weeks until there's a really good horse with really high odds.  There's no one on TVG with the sort of grind it out style.  However I think there's a lot of your common handicappers who go to the track every day and bet on just about every race and they do grind it out.  Either way, you have to have enough of a bankroll that you can withstand the long dryspells where you're not earning any profit.|`|7wL3RMN9aa	Grinding it out. Any pro that tells you different is telling you a lie or embellishing the truth. Think about it. To win big you need to wager big. Or bet on an unlucky occurance that happens with enough frequency to offset the many times it will not happen. Pro's always respect the odds no matter what their fancy is. Any pro with longevity to their trade grinds out a living.|`|kYVSmZy3aa	both: you can have both a good day , and or a good year...<br>     it collating the pain. some time's the bookie dose not have Enif.|`|8bTder08aa	One of my cousins made his living as a professional gambler for a few years, and he tended to have stretches where he'd make a good but not spectacular amount of money, interspersed with with stretches where he would break even or lose money, but again not spectacular amounts.  There were very, very few "big" scores, and after a couple of years he shifted to poker and blackjack because he found playing the horses was harder work than he wanted to do.  I don't know if his experiences were reflective of many other professional horseplayers.|`|URO3gDXcaa	grind it out.
D1beU6MPaa	I am so thrilled for McCarthy. He retired in 1990 as a High School principal. He is very lucky to have General Quarters, and yes, he is on the Derby trail watch. McCarthy is right  up there on the list of trainers such as Baffert, Tagg, Asmussen, Frankel, Ward, and so on. General Quarters won his first Stakes race last week in the Sam Davis Stakes at Tampa Bay. This horse is showing a lot of promise, and with McCarthy's love and climbing experience, I hope he hits the jackpot.

0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	Well, you can't expect me now to answer the question the way you wanted it man haha. Well, Spurs and Lakers have been and I'm not just sucking up to you and I'll explain my reasoning.<br>  <br>  Spurs have been my favorite team for the longest time, but thats not the reason. They have been one of the greatest teams that played well together and haven't missed a playoff opportunity. The big three plays together greatly and at ease and they are good guys on and of the court. I really enjoy watching them play and they have been a successful team.<br>  <br>  The Lakers, I swear I'm not sucking up to you but they have been a good team in the past decade for this reason. As they suffer defeats and they've had bad seasons they manage to keep there heads up and not get sucked into all the the drama, like a few years back when Shaq made the Kobe rap, Kobe didn't reply he just kind of took it at ease. They've also managed to be one of the top franchise, dropping real bad in the 03-04 season, but managed to turnaround there franchise within a year and make it back to the playoffs. I would like to see teams do this more often but the Lakers did it great. The Lakers are probably the "most dominant" because of all the bandwagoners and new fans, but they deserve it. <br>  <br>  Lakers and Spurs are probably the most dominant and have been in the sports world in the past few years without a doubt. The Lakers do it in a great way and can recover. The Spurs have a great team chemistry and have played well. Now tell me, isn't that a hard choice?|`|SFKw0FhWaa	Spurs....they have had the best chemistry and play as a team. Most importantly they have a coach who teaches the fundamentals of basketball (passing and defense) which is why they have won championships (run n gun offenses like the Suns have had are great for selling tickets, but you dont win the Big One)<br>  <br>  And, actually, if you consider the last 10 NBA championships, the spurs have actually won 4. Since the '09 one hasn't been played yet, you can go '99-'08 and Spurs won in '99, '03', '05, and '07. <br>  <br>  Granted, the Lakers DID win three in a row. But the Spurs were more impressive in how they did it. The spurs have the most talented scouts in the NBA. With guys like Ginobili, Parker, and Duncan who pretty much built the Dynasty after Robinson left and the pick ups of overlooked players like Bruce Bowen and eventually Roger Mason.<br>  <br>  One a side note, Derek Fisher beat the spurs in '04 conference semifinals by hitting a shot with .4 second left (which led to a rule stating that there must be at least .8 seconds left for anything but a tip). Had that rule been in effect then, the spurs would have gone up 3-2 and you never know...they may have beaten the pistons in the finals to make it 5.|`|sCiuv7n3aa	If speaking of DECADE... well it should be the SPURS<br>  <br>  Well in speaking of TEAM CONSISTENCY... look at the Spurs... really hard to spot the difference back then and now because of their powerful core players (Duncan, Parker, Bowen, Manu) maybe of course except for their age<br>  <br>  Well Lakers will really in 2nd place why??? because they have collapsed after SHAQ LEFT.... for 2 years they struggled till last year Pau Joined...<br>  <br>  Lakers disgraced their franchise at that instance Playoff 2005-06 <br>  In the elims After a 3-1 lead against the Suns, L.A. saw it slip away with 3 losses in a row including a pathetic game 7.|`|6qe9jeGOaa	since david stern helped the lakers get in 2002 I would have to say the spurs.I would've picked the lakers if it wasn't for the whole tim donaghy thing in 2002.to be honest I actually hate the spurs but out of those teams they had the best team.<br>  <br>  tim donaghy scandal:<br>  <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3436401" rel="nofollow">http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2943095" rel="nofollow">http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  @Mamba: thats only because the lakers shot way more free throws.thats why chris webber mike bibby yao ming and t-mac are mad about being cheated|`|EsnFmcMFaa	yeah i would have to say the lakers<br>  <br>  and i would have to say the lakers for the past 25 years too<br>  <br>  i mean they made the playoffs every year except for the year shaq left|`|sLVGdCOTaa	The Spurs, they had the best chemistry, teamwork , and fundamentals, the Lakers would be a very close second.|`|Nuj1eScCaa	San Antonio Spurs -  This team has never been bad.

The only other team that has come close is the Lakers except they became nothing without Shaq up until the past two years. If the Celtics can win again this year and bring in more talent next then they will be the closest to rival the Spurs franchise in the past ten years.|`|kAginzOLaa	definetly the celtics. last year they had the best record since a long time ago(i dont remember the exact year). plus the big three (boston three party) was beast. plus rondo and perkins didnt do anything but help. i remember i went to one game agains the knicks and they absolutely killed them. the lakers are good and they still are. i think theyre the best team over all because they have never been horrible they've never even been to bad. up until last year the celtics were horrible since larry bird and all those good ppl.|`|fSKQrR7Uaa	Lakers for sure.

vSuWyrFTaa	If this is your first pistol I'd suggest a revolver. Something like the Ruger GP100 with a 4 inch barrel. Chambered for 357 mag you can practice with 38 ammo and its easy to carry. Plus with a 158 gr magnum round you can stop any man.  If your set on a semi auto then I'd look at either a 9mm or a 40 cal. Ruger and FN both make very dependable and affordable firearms. The 9mm is easy to shoot, inexpensive and easy to conceal. The 40 packs a better punch, ammo is a bit more, and depending on the model you get may or may not fit your hand. Before you go "get you one". Take some time to research different options, check if theirs a range that rents out pistols, or see if a friend or coworker would take you shooting. Also get some input from a trusted friend or police officer if you know one.|`|dAK8dS4kaa	Really the best thing to do is try out a few different types of firearms and get a feel for the style that you want. My Grandpa loves his little .38 special hammer less revolver.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	The 357 Magnum is a no-nonsense Man stopper. * The Best Choice of caliber.* Use 125 grain jacketed hollow points for self-defense ammo in a 4inch revolver.* It has been tried, true, tested, and proven to be the Best choice.* Buy a S&W or a Ruger, or any other Brand in the 357 Magnum caliber.* You can also shoot 38 caliber ammo in a 357 Magnum.* You get two (2*) handguns for the price of one.*~~Best value, best choice, comfortable to shoot.*|`|acc06e32aa1b61885e803d0885de8de2aa	Something in 9MM would be my recommendation. A Glock model 17,19, Smith&Wesson M&P9, FNP-9. Any of these guns listed would be a good first gun. <br>  <br>  9MM is adequate for self defense with the right ammo, fairly light recoil and cheap to practice with.|`|AA11640949	You want the biggest caliber you can accurately shoot and then accurately and quickly place a follow up shot.<br>  <br>  My personal favorite is the .40 S&W.  It's a great combination of power and yet not having too much recoil.  Of course the weight of the pistol you choose will also have a pretty big impact on how much recoil you will feel.<br>  <br>  I absolutely love the new tactical "plastic" pistols.  Glock, S&W M&P, Springfield XD, Beretta PX4 Storm.. they are accurate and reliable, priced right and come in the big 3 calibers.. 9mm, .40S&W and .45.  Hold them all and see which one is more comfortable in your hand, which one you point better, etc.|`|KMASS2Gmaa	For what you want I am going to recommend a Taurus Judge. Info can be had at this site.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.taurususa.com/whatsnew/revolvers.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.taurususa.com/whatsnew/revolv...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.taurususa.com/video/taurus-theJudge-video.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.taurususa.com/video/taurus-th...</a><br>  <br>  I think this will provide exactly what you want.|`|c474fd81caa3e43b78b2c3cb23eb0a39aa	I see that you want an AUTOMATIC pistol.  It seems like alot of people here have a hard time reading.<br>  <br>  My first handgun was a beretta 92FS in 9mm.  Second was a Glock 19.  Most recently was a kel tec P3AT.<br>  <br>  Money is tights, so 9mm is really my only option.  40's and 45's are really only a little better, especiall if you use a quality hollowpoint.  <br>  <br>  As for your size, that will have NO bearing on what kind of recoil you can handle.  I've seen 100lb. women shoot 45's.  It is more of a mental thing, especially as long as you stay away from the larger, hunting/recreational revolver rounds.  They really don't have a practical application for self defense.  Besides, caliber is only one part of how much a gun recoils.  The make and size of a gun effects the recoil.  <br>  <br>  The beretta I have is beautiful.  Accurate, sexy, large and heavy.  This isn't a problem for home defense, but it is almost impossible to carry.  I got the Glock 19 for that, though I kind of wish I'd gotten the Glock 26 which is smaller.  The 19 is a "compact", while the 26 is a "sub-compact."  The Glock is durable and utilitarian.  I thought they were ugly when I first got it, but it grows on you.  Some people don't like the fact that it has no external safety, but a gun is a gun.  Don't point it at anything you don't want to kill.  Treat it as loaded, always.  <br>  <br>  The kel tec is a purely a carry gun that fits in your pocket double action only gun.  The .380 isn't my first choise, but it fullfills the first rule of a gun fight. (bring a gun).  I haven't gotten to actually shoot it (Saturday).  Kel tec's are kind of hit or miss, but you can always send it back to the factory. . . . . .<br>  <br>  I like my guns.  Springfield has some good ones.  Look at their XD models.  Ruger has some nice ones.  My dad owns one, which has worked like a champ so far.  They have a very slim, (sigma, I think)  full sized pistol that looks like it would be a good carry gun.  They also make a pocket pistol (LCR), but it is basically a Kel tec P3AT witha nicer finish.  If you are thinking of carrying, make sure and get a good holster.  They are expensive, but it makes a difference.  Taurus makes a good Beretta 92 clone.  Bersa makes some good guns too, and they will be cheaper.  <br>  <br>  Make sure and get some nice HP's to carry.  Federal Hydra shock, Remmington Golden sabers, and Hornady Critical Strike are a few.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.  Have fun, be safe.|`|cicyiuiXaa	I would recommend going to more than one gun show before making a purchase.  Also, going to the shooting range and shooting more than one gun.  Figure out the one you really want, and get it.  Otherwise you'll waste time and money on a bunch of guns that are "ok" versus "f----ing awesome"<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, and for self defense, you're a lot more likely to get shot at once you have a gun.  Best thing is martial arts, and I would recommend Aikido.  Or even better, a class on how to communicate more effectively, and how to deal with difficult people.  Killing them with kindness has always been my best weapon.  Though I am trained by the United States Marine Corps, and can easily take out anyone I'd like to, I'd much rather avoid conflict when possible, and using crafty diplomacy when necessary.|`|2XusVa4jaa	If you want a self defense firearm, think about a pump shotgun in either 20 or 12 gauge! Just the sound of of the round being chambered is enouch to scare away a scumbag  And if not, it's  more than enough to make him/her go away forever. Handguns take practice. Do you have time? I hope so. If not, get a shotgun.Good Luck and I Hope You And Yours Stay Safe!!!!|`|oXRZfAWaaa	For "self-defense"?  Are you gonna carry?  If so, consider a revolver.  They're simple (assuming this is your first gun, since you're not sure what you want), and you won't fatigue magazine clips.  <br>  <br>  As far as caliber, that's an age-old argument.  Get something north of a .357 and you'll be fine.|`|lT8MEI6Raa	I'd go for a 9mm if I were you. The ammo is relatively cheap, so you'll be able to afford to practice with it and learn how to shoot it and hit your target. I got my first handgun when I was 22, and it's a .380 (9mm short).  I wish I had spent a little extra and got a 9mm|`|zifMK9sPaa	i suggest you get something small hell i carry a .22 caliber the gun is very small and it can easily protect me no one wants to carry around anything bigger than what i have

Unlike other dogs they are five to six feet tall, walk upright, are blue in color, and chase catfish. While other dogs live on land, Seadogs usually live in or around the water.

WrDGhduxaa	Track is a difficult sport. Since you have not done it before you can try different things until you find what you like best.<br>  You should do it because if you don't you will not know if you like it or not.|`|pVpQuWXzaa	You should do the 100m, 200m, long or high jump, and 400m,800m,or 1600m. I do those events|`|c7LSZIuWaa	I don;t know about your school but at mine track is pretty tough.  You will get very frustrated and have to commit a lot but in the end it really pays off.

My advice is to find a few events that you like to do and feel that you are good at.|`|zTy5I5VPaa	depends on event

rTSwouqXaa	You are supposed to mount from the left side of the horse because most horses are right handed and the left side is the weaker side. Although you should teach your horse to mount on the right side because you never know if you have to mount from the right just in case.|`|AA10097817	Because most riders are right-footed and get on on the right side. It is what horses expect.|`|AA11456537	History.  <br>  Men/knights/soldiers/cow boys and such wore the guns and swords on the left hip. It is dangerous and difficult to mount up if the gear is in the way. So history and tradition devloped. ...in  a nut shell any way.....<br>  Most people are right handed and its safer and easier to draw out the weapon across the horse rather than on the same side. So thats why they wore it on that side. <br>  I havent bothered with the research yet about why ladies rode to the left side. But I recon it wound be too hard to find if I put in some effort.<br>  I suspect your teachers tell you that because their lesson horses have been trained to expect people only on 1 side and might spook from under you. Whatever ...If its your own horse you can train it to expect people to mount from either side. Personally I think its safer to train horses to let people mount from any direction with out spazzing.<br>  Wear a helmet  :)

You're right there, he'd never put the Wallabies before the All Blacks.|`|3vAsPs4Iaa	Considering the fact that he is a current member of the Rugby League World Cup winning Kiwis side it would be too little to say that the Australian Rugby Union is dreaming if they think Benji would choose to play for the Wallabies over the All Blacks. Seems to me to be another case of John O'Neil grasping at straws again considering that the outlook for the ARU and Australian Rugby Union in general is extremely bleak, or at least thats what I believe the prognosis is anyway so while this doesn't surprise me in the least, it also goes to show that Australian Rugby Union is already in dire straits if its so desperate to sweep up any and all rugby league players that consider or actually do switch codes.|`|IDBasYahaa	He only plays for NZ in RL because he's not good enough to play origin football or for the Kangaroo's.<br>  Quite frankly, if he made the switch, I wouldn't want him, he's too small to play in the centre's & he's style of play doesn't suit the style of play for inside backs.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	If he switches he would be looking at the ABs not the Wallabies
1jmXT4Vvaa	So shoot monster balls.  I don't see the problem.  You've found a paint that works, stick with it.|`|QTd8MVDjaa	What hopper do you have? If you have a gravity fed hopper, you're probably gonna get breaks with the MR2. If you don't have an electric hopper already, get one. That should cut down on the breaks. And turn your velocity way down and see if balls still break. If they do, then you can rule out the air doing it. The barrel might need smaller bore paint. Cold weather also makes paint brittle and easier to break. Try some winter paint. Hope one of these suggestions helps!|`|f6pXqMXnaa	I hate monster balls, but if they work, use em, a few copmanys  make winter paint, google winter paintballs.
l4WEwTWwaa	A victory against a past his prime 43 yr old is not an impressive victory. Neither is fighitng euro trash and welsh cab drivers. Calzaghe avoided every fighter in his division until they were old, 39 (Jones) and 43 (Hopkins) thats not impressive at all. Its a disgrace. Nobody even knew that Calzaghe was alive except for Brits until the Kessler fight. When you are 43-0 and nobody knows who you are there is something wrong there. He never fought a single big name in his prime. If you look at his list of opponents only his last seven fights had guys with decent records and they were all old or crap. Kessler is the only quality opponent he fought and retiring with only one notable win is not impressive at all. I have more respect for DLH who fought nothing but the best in six weight classes rather than a guy like Calzaghe who avoided everyone and retired when questions start to come up. So no, I would not put him anywhere near the list of greats because Ali, Duran, Hearns, Hagler, and Ketchel never ducked anyone and fought more than one good opponent.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	yes he should be|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	Not in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Calzaghe's most impressive win was over Mikkel Kessler.|`|tA5DrAPpaa	Never!

They are oddly shaped, and yes you do have a bigger risk of tearing your ACL, because it has a harder texture near the ankles and don't allow any breathing room, and they will most likely not stretch out to become more comfortable.|`|VEfh03cAaa	no its not. iv played soccer pretty much my entire life and i usually wear Adidas, i love them! the main reason people slip is because they have the wrong size and style. just because it is right for someone else doesn't make it right for you. to find the best cleat for you, get your gate checked to see what support you need.|`|wFzW3Aqvaa	ya i think they are i think adidas has the best cleats for anyone! :)

H0MFNydyaa	Named a 2008 Top 100 Family Campground<br>  Keewaydin State Park is on the St. Lawrence River, offering excellent boating, fishing and, during the winter, ice fishing and cross-country skiing. The sheltered marina provides dock space for seasonal and transient visitors. Overlooking the river are 48 campsites. The park's terrain includes steep, rocky outcroppings between the campsites and the shoreline, providing vantage points for watching the ocean-going vessels traversing the river. The park also has a swimming pool and picnic areas.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	If you google KOA, you'll find several good campsites all over northern New York.  You will need to make reservations, and it's best to call at  least six weeks in advance of your planned camping excursion.  KOA will also advise you of sites of interest near each of their campgrounds.  KOA is not expensive, nor are the numerous state-run campgrounds...which you can also look up as an alternative to KOA...One nice state facility is Robert Moses State Park near Massena, NY.  In fact, on July 25th and 26th, there will be a Civil War re-enactment there. Come on over and say hello - we love to have spectators come and let us teach them about the American Civil War and how it impacts your life today.|`|Lngb8ryFaa	just a short drive away is lake placid in the ADK's...you can camp at the ADK Loj--look it up<br>  also,<br>  cranberry lake state park<br>  st regis wilderness area|`|57f3bfe2a4e8d8a3e51925dbcb768abcaa	Keewaydin State Park rocks its small but was kept very clean!

Pc0QjrQ4aa	ESPN was out-bid for the US cable rights in the summer of 2005 by then-OLN (now Versus). <br>  <br>  ESPN, post-lockout, dramatically decreased its hockey coverage.  Their business model has been to cover (that is, cross promote) the sports to which they have rights, and effectively ignore the sports that they do not have the rights for.<br>  <br>  At the same time, ESPN gained NASCAR rights, and lost the rights to the US PGA Tour to the Golf Channel (coincidentally, Golf Channel is owned by Comcast, who also owns Versus).  Their coverage of the PGA Tour...plummeted.  NASCAR coverage?  Way up.<br>  <br>  Their own ombudsman has taken them to task for this on more than one occasion, in effect saying that they are not covering sports news, but rather using that forum as a cross-promotion vehicle, which means that their news division is anything but.<br>  <br>  You, as a viewer can choose to ignore ESPN.  Go online.  Read.  Find other sources of news and information.  What drives ESPN insane is that their NHL web content is a huge traffic-driver (the NBA and NASCAR...much less so).  <br>  <br>  ESPN/Disney has overpaid for NASCAR (ratings have tanked), poker (that fad has died); meanwhile, sports they should be trying to acquire (MMA, hockey, etc.) are going elsewhere.<br>  <br>  In short, ESPN is not going to cover hockey anytime soon (and honestly, their coverage was very over-rated).  They will try to crash the party (see the rehiring of Barry Melrose to offer up his witty bon mots) and act creepy and awkward, but in the end, they'll stick with what they have (the NBA, which is has a half-dozen franchises in far worse shape than the most bottom-feeding NHL club, and other overvalued and underperforming properties).  <br>  <br>  They lost the rights to a sport that has grown ratings and revenue every year since the lockout (compare that to the sinkhole that is the bouncy-ball game).|`|xO2fDqklaa	Because hockey isnt exciting. It ranks behind MLB, NFL, NBA, NCAA Football, NCAA basketball, Golf, and then hockey.  It isnt a popular "American" sport. Most people dont like it, the ratings are low everywhere. If it is the lowest rated part of ESPN as well, why would they put it on there alot. I know im not the only person to change the channel when they talk about hockey.|`|Hki3AoL5aa	n8 you're very wrong, i cant tell you that just in Wasington DC tv rating for the caps have gone up 140% from last year and have has 16 sellouts compared to just 8 last saeason.  Its not a popularity issue.  Its that nthe nhl broke off ties with ESPN and went to VS. and im sure ESPN was just like well screw it nobody cares abou it, we'll just report the scores and have maybe one or two people cover just in case.|`|hX089rlnaa	They did a couple of years ago, but the ratings were poor, then came the lockout. So VS took over. That's Ok, ESPN sucked at Hockey coverage anyway.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	ESPN is good for highlights and nothing else. And I'm not talking about just hockey.|`|M6P7r57faa	Just like all of these guys here.... you need to get laid!|`|KTQWtNGFaa	Because not that many people are currently interested in hockey even though it is one of the most exciting sports there is. For people who don't watch it, it can be hard to follow becuae it is so fast paced. another reason is kids don't grow up playing hockey llike football, baseball, or basketball. If your bored you can throw a football or shoot hoops in the driveway but most people can't play hockey in the backyard.|`|LerNCpIJaa	Because they haven't been able to market it like other sports (e.g. lack of major personalities, issues and controversies) and the American society in general doesn't follow hockey. All extremely unfortunate but ESPN is trying to get the best ratings possible which means that they have to sacrifice hockey. Boo American public.|`|NkMXnQopaa	I guess they don't consider it "exciting" and there isn't much to talk about which I believe it isn't true. What I mean by "exciting" stories like steriods in MLB and players being arrested and shooting themselves in the NFL. But once Sean Avery makes a comment/scene all of the sudden for a brief period of time they talk about it. That's just how I see it.|`|j17vl3Nwaa	Im not sure why they don't broadcast any games but a good sign is that hockey games and Highlights are showing up on sports center. Hopefully that means ESPN is close to paying more attention to the greatest game ever.|`|wlbM1Q9Raa	Hockey is the greatest game on Earth and they play Bowling and Womens basketball over it. it makes no sense that ESPN can be so absurd not to play hockey on TV. Maybe have like an ESPN Tuesday night Hockey or something. That could catch on
zFTSg47waa	Billiards: Pocketless table (5 x 10 ft), generally played with 3 balls. Different games include 3-cushion, 5 pin, or straight rail, although there are other options. The balls are slightly bigger than pool or snooker balls.<br>  <br>  Pool: Six pockets on a table (4.5 x 9 ft). Popular games include 8 ball, 9 ball, 10 ball, one pocket, and straight pool. The balls are numbered 1-15 and the games take advantage of them in various ways.<br>  <br>  Snooker: Big table with six pockets (6 x 12 ft). Pocket openings have rounded corners so you have to be more exact with shots. Snooker balls are a little smaller. There are 15 red balls, and 6 colored balls plus the cue ball.

MwDRb7GLaa	There are lots of different styles of bikes. Choose what you are going to do with the bike. Be very realistic. That will determine which bike style works best for you.<br>  <br>  There are several kinds of bikes:<br>  Commuter / hybrid<br>  Mountain<br>  Road Race<br>  Touring / sport (light) touring<br>  <br>  Go to your local bike shop, try several brands and styles out. One should stand out as a comfortable fit. This is your bike.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Go to any of the local bike shops and check them out.|`|05cNPeRtaa	This depends what type of racing you will be doing.  If it is downhill mountain racing you should choose a sturdy mountain bike that is not too heavy.  Look for shock absorbers in the front and under the seat.  Disc brakes would also help.  If you will be road racing and a looking for a starter bike, Trek has a nice line of bikes, but if you want a serious road racer, look more into Orbeas or LeMonds.  Ask if you can try out the bike in the store and try switching gears and pedaling to see if everything is comfortable.
AA11657356	Stretch your legs thoroughly before practice, this will really help to prevent them. Make sure that you are staying hydrated because cramping is one of the symptoms of dehydration. Also, if you are able to, try using zoomers instead of flippers. They are shorter in length, so you will not be able to swim as fast, but they do not tear up your leg muscles like flippers can and will give you a better workout.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.swimoutlet.com/product_p/1267.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.swimoutlet.com/product_p/1267...</a>|`|92df82e95b3b1086d69d36994ca2effdaa	Here's a simple yet often overlooked answer.  First and foremost, make sure the fins fit correctly.If they are too tight they will surely cause cramping.  Also can happen if they are too loose as well.  I had someone with open heel fins (The kind where you where booties) tell me that they always got cramps. I watched them swim and then struggle to take the fins off.  They were WAY to tight.  The person said that's what the store sold them, and it should be a little tight as they didn't want them to fall off.  They had bought a new pair of booties and didn't realize that they were twice as thick making the fins twice as tight.  <br>  <br>  So just ask someone to check them and make sure they fit properly.|`|RQdSSW7Caa	Eeeek! i get that all the time, even without fins. Its really painful but it means your lacking Vitamin C, so drink orange juice :D

kfdkiLzAaa	for my high school tryout, you need to do a toetouch and one other jump of your choice: a pike, hurdler, or hurkey. then we had to do a cheer and then a dance routine, both of which they taught us. the most important things are to be veeerrryyy sharp with your motions, stop them somewhat in front of you, like dont overextend. also be energized and smile a lot! if you forget the routine, catch on and keep going!! also some schools require you to have a standing backhandspring. to prepare, i would recommend taking a tumbling class, sounds like you could pick up on that easily! and more importantly, a beginning cheer class to make sure you are doing your motions and jumps right, it helps a lot! anyway good luck :)|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	Defiantly not reading.|`|nltFZcuGaa	just look hot and your in. theres nothing else to it|`|QwCsFKLQaa	prepare for vaginal bleeding.|`|szkrumAJaa	Saying "Oh, my gosh"
nRBC4E5saa	I drop about half a pound every time I pee...<br>  <br>  Anyway, if you're just cutting water weight now, you want to eat stuff like Iceberg lettuce, melons, apples, or other things that have a high water content.  They will provide your body with vitamins, nutrients, and some carbs without adding too much overall weight.  They will make you feel fuller, and you can just sweat or pee out the excess water.  Eating anything substantial, like a bowl of rice or a chicken breast, will add too much "real" weight to your body.  Basically, when you look at a food, imagine how much is left when all the water is taken out.  If a lot is left over, that's how much your body has to process.  If only a little is left over, that's how much "true" weight will be added to your system.  Remember, getting rid of water is easy.  That can pass through your system in an hour or so.  Solid material takes hours, even days.  Usually I just eat apples when I'm cutting, and my performance is fine.|`|01cIxqiAaa	Are you cutting five pounds for a fight? If so how far out? Is five pounds all you need to get to your weight class or are you just trying to lose five pounds.<br>  <br>  If your cutting 5 pounds to get into a weight class, all you need to do is cut your water weight. I've seen fighters cut almost 30 pounds in water alone, so five pounds is cake. Just a sauna suit and a couple of hours on the treadmill or bike, or just sit in the sauna with the suit on.<br>  <br>  If you want to lose five pounds of fat. Eat six small portioned meals of a mix of protein and carbs (like brown rice) and a salad or fruit in between your main meals. Each meal spaced out by about 2 to 2 1/2 hours.|`|BbK0fA4Laa	Not eating the required min. of 1200 calories a day is very unhealthy and even potentially dangerous. <br>  <br>  The body needs food to produce the energy required to keep your internal organs going and you moving.<br>  <br>  If you want to cut that 5 lbs to get into a certain weight class then I suggest you try exercising.|`|AA11461754	salads.... with no dressing.. you can even add little pieces of chicken patty.  Thats usually what I eat the week before my fights..I usually walk around at my fight weight anyways, but the salad helps maintain it.<br>  <br>  Also note:<br>  Breakfast: oatmeal (no sugar!!)<br>  Lunch: protein bar.. water..and a banna<br>  dinner: the salad i mentioned!|`|tXTB8inJaa	depends, like other said eat light. for a weigh in, you shouldn't be eating or drinking anything, u don't necessarily need a sauna suit or a sauna. if you have a lot of clothing u can go run and so on. for the first 5 pounds shouldn't take more then max 2 hours of running around skipping and such. main thing is to never stop moving.
eFQXl7uyaa	As far as looks (different web designs) they are just personal preference. The main differences are position based. Outfielders use larger webbed gloves that give them a little more reach and pocket since they will often make long runs to catch a ball in the air. Infielders use smaller and lighter gloves since the ball is usually traveling faster and mostly on the ground, they also have to get the ball out of the glove faster to throw out a runner. First base is designed for both catching very hard thrown balls and has a large surface that helps pick balls out of the dirt - they are the largest and heaviest of gloves. Catcher is of course designed to catch a 100mph fastball without breaking your hand. Then there are the pitchers....They use all types of infield or outfield gloves but they have to take into consideration anything on the glove that may be considered distracting to hitter (that is illegal for a pitcher) like a white logo on the strap and most pitchers pick their glove not for fielding but they take into account how their hand looks in the glove and can hitters pick up movement that gives away pitches - that's why you will almost never see a pitcher wearing a glove where 1 finger is exposed and pitchers use those gloves and have a patch sewn on to hide their finger.<br>  <br>  Most of the designs beyond the purpose of the glove are more for personal preference - deeper pockets, more padding, combined finger areas etc. We all have different shaped hands and we all catch the ball in a slightly different hand position so after choosing a glove of your purpose then its about fit and feel. So a perfect glove for you may break someone elses hand if you have one designed for a more web catch and someone who likes a pocket catch tries it. <-- trust me on that one. And it took about 3 weeks before I could play again...|`|AA12063701	theirs the catchers glove, the pitchers, 2nd base etc...|`|lGuM37sGaa	The "trap" is the part of the webbing between the thumb and index finger that essentially is there to provide a pocket for the ball. The ones you mention are primarily for infielder gloves. They are just different webbing styles, the "H" web looking like the letter H and the Eye Web looking more like a lattice (maybe is is named that because it covers your eyes but you can still see through it when held up to your face, I don't know.) The webbing style is entirely a matter of personal preference and fielding style. Some fielders will be more aggressive in snatching the ball and might not need as deep a webbing but need one with more surface friction. Try different styles and see what suits you. If you are an outfielder the webbing is important for you to be able to shield your eyes from the sun while getting a bead on a pop fly, and if you are a first baseman just go for the biggest legal web you are allowed to get (and make sure you break it in really well.)

j8kg4oI0aa	If the baton interfers with any other teams running (ie goes into another teams lane) you get DQ'd (disqualified). If the baton doesn't interfere with another teams progress, you pick it up and continue running. It is really hard to recover and do well in the relay after you have dropped the baton though :(|`|J6xmZqj1aa	In all levels of track HS to olympic you are idiomatic disqualified. And your teammates hate you forever.  At my school we aren't allowed to ever let a baton touch the ground, even during workouts, or warm.  If you drop in a race you are shunned(not really), during practice it's just 20 perfect push-ups in front of the whole team. A friend of mine dropped one during practice and we never let him forget it.|`|isf5gDbmaa	I run the 4x400m relay in high school and i have never experienced this before, but i was taught by my coach that if yu ever drop a baton, you need to automatically pick it up and keep going like nothing has ever happened. He said that if the baton is dropped your relay team gets points off.  But you do not get disqualified.  Some places are very different though, so you might wanna check that with your coach.|`|kxmxJXEGaa	In the olympics you are disqualified, I don't know the rules to high school and college.|`|6fD0r9Icaa	You just pick it up and keep running|`|kzbEWqgLaa	disqualified|`|1EhbLBkUaa	You lose, since you have to stop and pick it up.... unless your team is insanely better than everyone else and you had a tremendous lead, that means everyone else passes you.  This is why they work so hard at handing off batons properly and efficiently; if you bobble it, you're out of the running (pun intended).
WiIUEObTaa	, great question. older person. ballerinas are the worlds greatest athletes period. there is no argument . plain simple fact. are dancers great all around athletes. yes they are. better athletes than player on the field . again yes. more intense training again yes. if you are a great great all around athlete , you are participating in a sport. the reason why there are doubters. the macho male ego cannot allow women to be athletes. it sticks in their craw. pure sexists bigotry. the same people are outspoken about cheer leaders. those who berate all these activities , last played a sport at age 10. it was discovered that they were and still are physical failures in life. dance is a sport, cheerleading is a sport . those who disrespect these great athletes . are not qualified to say yes or no. they failed|`|7BHIyMFmaa	Not really, IMO it's for people who aren't talented or dedicated enough to be gymnasts, or even cheerleaders for that matter.|`|UjIvoLhbaa	O.M.G YES IT IS!

RjQLB9s1aa	You are right that Ashley is gorgeous. I guess that her tennis doesn't do much talking as her best ranking was about 40 (from memory) & she is comparable to Anna Kournikova, who was beautiful but couldn't play tennis to save her life.<br>  <br>  One of the problems that she may have to face up to is that she may never be taken seriously after this. However, Playboy tends to glamourise the person, so appearing nude can add prestige & glamour to your name.<br>  <br>  From a separate angle, she is making every opportunity of what she has today - so best of luck to her. She may never win a "Slam" but these pics will certainly move her in to the spotlight.<br>  <br>  I am not sure if anyone in the top 10 would pose naked, but if the money was right - who knows? I agree that Jelena might be tempted but I think that they would look at it more towards retirement - so possibly Mauresmo. Outside the top 10, Hantuchova & Kirilenko are just two that have done modelling of swimwear, etc, so I think that they would be more tempted. <br>  <br>  I guess that time will tell. In the mean time, enjoy Ashley............

Go to community college and take a couple of classes in small business management and get certified in your city/state in childhood education: you'll need both if you plan on running a school as a business. Why? This is where the money is when it comes to opening up a martial arts studio: essentially 2 hours of afternoon/evening care for the kids, to the parents can go off and get shopping done or just take a break. Teaching adults is fine, but the real money is in the munchkins.<br>  <br>  2. Start off offering classes in large gyms, such as the YMCA. Build up a client base there, then move off to your own place.<br>  <br>  3. Alternately, be an assistant instructor somewhere else, and make it successful enough that y'all need to branch out.<br>  <br>  4. Advertise yourself (functionally) as a daycare. Get the necessary certification to be qualified as a daycare. Offer to pick up the children with a van or something from school.<br>  <br>  5. Understand your target demographic. What are you teaching, and why? Self defense is different from combative sport is different from fitness is different from duelling is different from spiritual enligtenment. Most martial arts have all of that, to varrying degrees, but UFC-style MMA is different from Tai chi, and different people study those thigns for different reasons. <br>  <br>  6. Understand yourself - what exactally do you WANT to teach, and is there enough of a demand for that style of instruction to support a lifestyle? For example, my instructor is really good, but running his school is his second job: he's an insurance claims guy by day. He doesn't make enough money in teaching martial arts to support himself, his wife, and his two (college-aged) kids. <br>  <br>  7. Until you can support yourself teaching martial arts, continue with your day job. (This also fits well into the "teach at the YMCA until you get enough students.") <br>  <br>  8. When you do build up enough of a client-base, get them to sign contracts, and only THEN open your school. A guy at my FMA school taught at the YMCA, built up his clientelle, and then when he opened his own school they all abandoned him. Lessons learned: get people to commit financially, and they're more likely to follow through with you.<br>  <br>  9. Build up your connections BEFORE you open your school - know who does sports competetion that you can compete in, get to know the senior instructors in your style (if any) in the area. Network with them. yeah, you are in theory in competition with them, but if you're filling an unfulfilled need (such as providing the service in an area they don't cover) it won't be a big deal.<br>  <br>  10. Understand your competition, and the (often unethical) techniques they use: here's a good analysis of how martial arts gets packaged as a business: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nononsenseselfdefense.com/MAbiz.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nononsenseselfdefense.com/MAb...</a>|`|5KjvNg2oaa	when i opened my first school i used to use generous offers like advertise that i could teach anyone to defeat any opponent with only one strike, or the din mak death punch, or also to teach them to fight multiple opponents /attackers and win without fear without any weapons. many students came, many students learned, many new warriors were emerged. nuff said.|`|HMYAAAnnaa	omg   pLEASE DONT TRY TO TEACH MY KID NOTHING

I would also think that cartwheels on the ground are easier, but ive always been able to do those :[ For backbends, i would do bridges. You know, start on the ground and bridge up. then if you get to that, just keep trying to kick over. Soon youll be able to do a backbend from standing and a kickover.<br>  I am a cheerleader and still cannot do a back walkover...i can do back handsprings, but not back walkovers.<br>  and i also did not start gymnastics until i was 12....and i got to this point (a good point) all you can do is just keep getting a little father everyday!

Then, if you still think that you disagree with them, ask them to try it this year, and see how you like it, explain to them your point of view, so they could understand it also.  I really don't know how i could help you, because i don't know your parents or anything about you.  You could try telling them, that if you do cross country, that it will not interfere with your school work, etc ( all the things that are important to them). Don't argue with them too much.  Try talking to your coach at school, and explain to them your situation, maybe they can help.  If any of your really close friends run xc then,ask their parents to talk to yours, and see if that will help any.<br>  I really think that xc is a great sport, and its enjoyable. You get to meet lots of new cool people, exercise, and have fun.  <br>  Good luck.|`|kxmxJXEGaa	Just tell them you want to try something different.

AA11539218	You can find older product for around $250, usually shops drop the prices on remaining last season stock to make way for new product.  So now that the 2009 product is available, you should be able to find decent prices on 2008 product...boards and bindings.  Alternatively you can buy a new or used board off of ebay - a lot of retailers will offer their older models, still brand new in plastic, on ebay for a lot cheaper just to get them sold. Also, shop around....websites and local dealers are a great way to look out for sales and discounts on equipment...one thing i have learned is you should never have to pay retail for wakeboarding equipment...there is always a way to get it on sale or discounted.|`|14a542270477c6ec665696b6980a2370aa	as far as price is you'll need to shop around, but you could try Wakeworld.com, they have a boardwizard that you just input your weight and riding level and it'll give you some options to work with, then you could try different websites like Buywake, Wakeside, Evo.com, boardstop.com to shop and compare prices. <br>  <br>  you can't go wrong with a package deal though, and usually you can get the board and the bindings at or around that price, right now is good to get some '08 gear since they'll be tryin' to clear their shelves for the 09 stuff. so you just might snag you a good deal.|`|9P6HAawLaa	<a href="http://www.buywake.com/catalog/detail/maDqw" rel="nofollow">http://www.buywake.com/catalog/detail/ma...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I won this in a Competition last year<br>  and Im in Love.

cicyiuiXaa	for shin splints, you grab a handful of marbles and a jar, sit down in a chair with the jar in front of you, place the marbles around the jar and use your toes to pick up the marbles and drop them in the jar.  You can do this exercise with imaginary marbles and jars and work your shins still.  Make sure you stretch your shins during and after.  Get a cube of ice, rub it on your left shin til it melts away.  Get another ice cube, rub it on your right shin til it melts away.  <br>  <br>  For your calves, drink a little more water--you don't have to do a gallon a day or anything crazy.  Just drink a half cup, let a few minutes pass, drink another half cup, let a few minutes pass.  The idea is to allow your body to accept the water and use it as lubrication, not to drink so much that you have to go to the bathroom right away, but you'll have to go to the bathroom eventually, so don't kill your kidneys by holding it in.  Stretch your calves out for 5 minutes before you sleep and when you wake up.  That should help to loosen them up.  Get a yoga tape from your local library.  Good calves stretches there.|`|kxmxJXEGaa	Be sure you are stretching them before you run. Also, you need more potassium, bananas are excellent for that.<br>  <br>  Also, when you are done running walk a bit and stretch again.<br>  <br>  After you have had time to rest, sit on the floor with your legs out stretched and straight and bounce them up and down. nothing stressful, then pull your toes towards you then push them all the way back, do that 5 times then go back to bouncing your legs.<br>  <br>  It will stretch and relax your calf muscles.|`|4kIUh76Qaa	Shin splints are nothing to mess with.  As a runner that's run many 5ks/10ks/15ks, run 4 marathons, and trained at 40+ miles/week for a number of years, I know how hard they can be.  The principle of RICE should be followed (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) along with drinking plenty of water, lots of stretching, and the various exercises you can find online (marbles in a jar, stretch game, clam shells, etc.).  Probably the biggest thing you can do right now is STOP RUNNING.  I know that sounds counter intuitive to you as a runner, but you need to lay off the contact training for a good 4-6 weeks and get your butt in the pool or on a stationary bike to keep/improve your fitness.  Cross train and be in great shape for when you are able to get back on the track, and you will thank me later.  If not, you won't let your body heal and this will become a lingering problem that may require more intensive therapy, longer recovery, or even surgery down the road.

nRBC4E5saa	You only want two reasons?<br>  <br>  -It can be used as a range finder.  No other punch will land if you can't land your jab.<br>  <br>  -It's used to keep a shorter opponent at bay.  Every time they move forward, jab them in the face.  It will discourage them from closing the distance.<br>  <br>  -It's used to set up every other punch, or even kicks or takedowns depending on what competition you're in.  Everything else is easier to see coming if you don't use it.<br>  <br>  -It can be used as a distraction.  By keeping your jab in the face of your opponent, you're keeping their vision occupied with your fist.<br>  <br>  Pick any two out of those.|`|C0sT0PPyaa	for judging measure, and setting up a knockout punch<br>  <br>  these are the two primary functions|`|4gwSrPhfaa	the jab is really one of the most under used weapons, it sets up alot of combos, it keeps ur opponents guard up, and in a real match u would want to use the jab bc maybe the first 10 or so will not hurt or do much damage but they will start to take there toll after and if nothing else its a good practice to stay active and set up all the rest of ur combs , plus when u throw it after u have thrown a right hook or cross the jab, will push ur opponent back to a distance so they can strike at u again|`|7obFZ2Gyaa	I believe  you are asking  what are  two MAIN reasons ?     <br>  <br>  One is to  keep your opponents guard up for  jabs then   use your feet to catch him off guard<br>  <br>  Two is  to keep your  opponent at a distance so  you can  use your feet to attack.  I was good in sparring cuz my legs were  long and I could do mulitple kicks  unlike other  fat or slow  people.  I ended up at Blue stripe in Tae Kwon Do   but wish I  kept going on to black belt. I still love Martial Arts though.|`|zhpOEQC0aa	For distraction purposes and to create openings for your other weapons.

nRBC4E5saa	You can vary the intensity of your training depending on how you and your partner feel.  Try using a 1-10 scale to decide where you're going to be that day.<br>  <br>  The benefit of light sparring is that it gives you a chance to try techniques that you wouldn't do under the pressure of hard sparring.  Think of it almost like playing a game of tag.  You'll probably have to go slower than normal too.  But light sparring is a great way to work on being more technical, being more of a thinker.  It certainly has its place in training.<br>  <br>  Hard sparring is obviously more realistic.  Everyone needs to eat a good punch once in a while as a sort of reality check.  However, I don't recommend hard sparring every time you're out.  If you're training five days a week, maybe only spar hard two or three times.  The body can only take so much punishment.  Even pro boxers don't do a lot of hard sparring unless they have a fight coming up.|`|XhsVP75uaa	you should go hard sometimes most the time about 50 - 60% to work technique.|`|iIRPJhwUaa	Sparring allows you to train at speed. Moderate is usually best so that you can concentrate on improving your technique. Going hard at least once a month will help you adjust your game while dealing with some real difficult blows. To improve your stand up, work your combinations with kicks and punches. Get your balance so that the foot leaving the ground is as effortless as a punch. Bruce still had the best advice to improve your kick, kick. to improve your punches, punch. Boxing punches are very effective, but the elbow strikes and knee strikes are truly devastating.

c2NDhLnDaa	Very few people ifs anybody can sprint up a hill full speed for 30 minutes straight.. I'd revise your running plan a little bit to something that makes more sense..|`|7R7e6yX5aa	try hitting a punching bag and just running at a slow and steady speed for an hour/ four times a week|`|d1Y0cZumaa	It is extremely good for you to do this. You've taken your time to practice and it really is a good plan. It will seriously improve your running and also remember to stretch before and after you run and also before your games, don't forgot that. Use your soccer ball more though so you can practice it more. Maybe another 10 min using a soccer ball might help.. hope this helps|`|CtwEFHcqaa	I would increase your jog time a lot and decrease your sprint time. Try sprinting on the track, time yourself and see improvement. Sprinting up hills is a good idea but you'll be tired after a minute or two of doing it, I can't imagine doing 30 whole minutes(doing hill repeats for 30 minutes is okay, just don't sprint for 30 minutes)|`|vXkPUOWdaa	sounds goood to me is that your own routine?|`|4kIUh76Qaa	OK, I'm assuming that you are running for conditioning for soccer so I am going to stay away from the dribbling portion since that falls outside the realm of conditioning.  <br>  <br>  You need to make distance a key part of your workout since you are trying to improve your fitness (your VO2-max, specifically) so that you can run longer and harder during your matches and not get winded.  I would plan on running a minimum of 3 days per week with a steady increase in your mileage as your body allows.  Overtraining injuries are far too common in sports so make sure you run on good shoes with less than 400 miles on them, try to stay off the pavement as much as possible (treadmills, tracks, and grass are MUCH better alternatives because they are much softer).  Ditch the hill workout because that really won't do much for you other than hurt your Achilles and add to the chances you will get shin splints.  <br>  <br>  I have no idea what your current level of fitness is, but here is a sample workout routine based on a person that can run 10 miles/week now.<br>  Mon - Run 3 miles<br>  Tues - rest/soccer drills (dribbling, etc)<br>  Wed - Run 3 miles<br>  Thurs - 8 sets of 100 meter sprints followed by a 1 mile run<br>  Fr - rest<br>  Sat - Run 3 miles<br>  Sun - rest<br>  <br>  This is very basic, but you get the idea.  If you can run more, then increase the mileage. If you are an accomplished athlete and in petty good shape, run itnervals or fartleks as well (google them if you don't know what they are).  The keys are consistency, safety, avoidance of overtraining, and steady/gradual increass to your workload.  You do all these things, you'll be on a different level this fall when soccer season starts!
Z9WVDGDcaa	You should just leave it on.  The agitator spins a lot - which is more just annoying than actually being bad for the hopper.
isf5gDbmaa	I've noticed that allot of people have been asking this question, and it is a stupid question. Track is not like height or weight, where you need to be a certain height and/or weight for your age, grade etc. Its a sport that is all in you.  I have a friend that is now in 9th grade and she runs the 400m at 55 sec. When she was in 7th grade she ran it at 59 sec. and broke 4 school records in the 70m,100m,200m,and the 400m. While some kids ran the 400m at 1:35, 1:15, etc. There really isn't an answer for your question, it all depends on what a person can do ,and what they are capable of.  You can always get better.  Stop questioning, and start believing in yourself. There's always going to be kids that will beat you, but there also will be kids that won't.  If you wanna get better then train.  Ask you track coach about different training tips, and work hard at practice, and meets, always listen to your coach.  Give it all you got at all times.  <br>  Good luck.|`|8Qf3w7fOaa	I run track. ranked 5th in state when i was a 6th grader am now a 7th grader.There is no possible answer for how should a 7th grader get faster because it varies.....  but on how you can get faster you can do half-mile or mile runs and try to get under 8mins.....and do leg exercises to build the muscles in your legs.... when you are running take long strides pick your legs up and pump your arms and you will be the next dash off the incredibles!!haha|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Sprints or distance?  Basic speed is mostly what you are born with, distance running can be learned, it helps to have a good body, but distance runners can greatly improve. Sprinters are either fast or they are not.

hY5WFyeTaa	keep a softball in your glove at all times. It will eventually reform a pocket.<br>  Your best chance at getting it formed fast is oiling/conditioning it with a ball in the desired part of the pocket (not palm). Then put it under your mattress when you're not using it.|`|kAznuRTIaa	Stick a softball in the palm of the glove,to where the gloves thumb and pinky finger slots touch tip-to-tip. Wrap a shoe string around the glove and ball then re-oil it. Put the glove under something heavy for a few days and let it "reform". Just don't ust a lot of oil though.|`|XD8r5KPRaa	I'd say it was caused by oiling it.<br>  When I got my first glove, we put it in the oven, and that softened it up, and dried it out a bit. That might get the stuff that makes the glove slippery in the oil 'out', but I'm not sure of any further detail. Are you sure you're holding it tight enough?

Perhaps Arsene does like Andrei's name lol|`|jqFlrejqaa	nah ye aint and will never be, Kaka is younger as well. Still a good player tho and if he only costed 12m (what i herd) its a good buy|`|4yBlEtaaaa	he's better than keane but no way is he as good as kaka|`|7e76bf014097e913315078f97333c60aaa	No Kaka is a lot better and has inspired AC Milan in a much harder league than St Petersburg in Russia.  Arshavin made his name in Euro 2008 playing for an over-rated Russia, who although they chalked up some good wins along the way (England, Greece, Holland) also benefited from the complacency of a lot of their opponents.|`|rIzx4OEWaa	There's only one way to look at it duke an it's simple.  Spurs tried to purchase him in the summer but couldn't even though they went as high as 18,Million according to reports but Zenit, the greedy buggers wanted 20, Million an would not accept a penny less. Spurs for once had the sense not to want to overpay for him at the time. Arsen, at that time said he was a good player but that Zenit wanted to much money for Arshavin, an so he would not even try to enter the bidding war at that price. He also said circumstances can change in six months an he was prepared to wait an see what happens. Arsen ever the frugal expert who can find the great players at the right price, what's more he never has to sell a player an then buy him back. Players join Arsenal because they want to play for a club who know what the spirit of the game is really all about an are willing to take a cut in wages to go there. Unlike Keane who left for the lure of a better financial wage packet an who as he left said he wanted to join a club that would win trophys an medals an have the chance to play in the Campions league. Is this because he thought Spurs would never obtain such greatness who knows ? I guess Keane is the only one who can answer that one. Perhaps Liverpool were fooled by the help he had been given from that other great striker at Man U now to get his goals, an at Liverpool he showed his not worthy of a place in a Champions league spot, selling him back to Spurs was perhaps the kindest thing to do for him. As for Kaka at least he knows how to pay back his supporters an stays not for the lure of the money but for the love of the fans an the game an the way it is played. By the way Kaka also stated the only club he would really want to play for in the prem is Arsenal because they love the game an play the way he likes.|`|qO7nbSQVaa	He had a good Euro 2008 but is still unproven to me so no he is not as good as Kaka and probably never wll be but under the eye of Wenger he should be a success at Arsenal.|`|m0NuDgzBaa	hahahahahaha!  well, what has arshavin done of incredible in his career?!? nothing!  .  kaka' has dragged his team to the Champions League!!!|`|Pfq2zRejaa	They certainly are haha, but in the eyes ov the arsenal fans he's the best in the world
kKbqdlbnaa	At first I was disappointed with the trade because I saw that Lowry shot a whopping 25% from behind the arc (ugh) but it's good to know that he's a promising young guard. Skip will no doubt help the Magic, but he has his shooting slumps and they come at anytime. With Orlando, Rafer will most likely just shift to being a backup PG for Jameer in the playoffs. Actually, the Rockets have tried both Rafer and Brooks on the court at the same time and had some success but its risky playing with an undersized SG.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	Rockets-get more cap space and get a chance to develop brooks<br>  <br>  Magic-get a guy who can play for jameer,and fill in since hes injured<br>  <br>  Grizzlies-act like retards and think about the future<br>  <br>  overall this trade is pointless because in big games jameer is gonna play the majority,still it adds depth but they wont play together much and wont be a finisher (pietrus,jj,etc)<br>  i really dont get it for rockets or grizzlies|`|dDhTMacAaa	Memphis is devoting their PG slot to Mike Conley Jr., as they should - and Houston took advantage. As you said, Lowry is underrated and darn good and that was a good pickup for the Rockets.<br>  <br>  Magic got a solid PG for a 1st rounder that will be in the early-mid 20's that Memphis can use.<br>  <br>  good deal all-around.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	The Grizzlies are always losers in trades.  I think they try to give good players away.  <br>  <br>  Can somebody please buy the team from Michael Heisley?

The Grizzlies are also freeing up cap space and the Magic, well the reason they got Alston is because they know he can fill the void at PG.  That Anthony Johnson guy won't cut it and obviously they are quite sure that Jameer Nelson will be out, indefinitely.  The Magic made a smart move and they are saying that they are gonna win this year, even without Jameer.

Bill Russell.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUhmZVlICDc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUhmZVlIC...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|Lpf6Eu3eaa	Real talk...........Bill Russell and my Moms went to school together in Oakland. <br>  <br>  Bill had a phat crush on my Mexican moms LOL that the truth ruth<br>  <br>  so i'd say Bill|`|Zt1VDawZaa	I like Paul Pierce maybe its because Ive been a fan since 2005 (NBA Fan)|`|F1xpcJ2Laa	Larry Bird is my favorite all time player|`|KFs7hWP9aa	Larry Bird|`|w8AFCj5xaa	Larry Bird .....|`|f35bf12a8eff1dc4cd38d5447b69023aaa	ray allen|`|2RPtsrQGaa	have to be the bird man cause that was when the NBA was fun to watch|`|dmg6OjjZaa	larry bird, and then pistol pete|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Walter McCartny and Bill Russel|`|0gWxnY0Gaa	haha u should know my fave by now...<br>  Rajon Rondo!!  =D|`|13XU8cCKaa	Bill Russel.  He was such a dedicated player then and still dedicated to the Celtics now.|`|XT8eNPhVaa	Bill Russell!!!|`|dDhTMacAaa	lol I had a feeling it was you, man<br>  <br>  Answer is Bill Russell, 11 rings......no contest|`|vFJtmmN0aa	no matter wht he was the best larry bird
C6d5yElWaa	No, and remember, if Liverpool were to win the title, good old Blobbie Keane will be eligible for a winners' medal.    I wonder where his true allegiance will be...|`|0HO8sTGeaa	idk..... you s***|`|96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	well if i was keane and been treated like he was i would exact my revenge on them and make sure i scored against them|`|2ZqKDMMRaa	Mr keane is in it for the money scorring against liverpool on the last game of the season in the last minute would make me a happy man as long as it keeps liverpol off the top spot.. What comes around goes around cmon the spurs...|`|zJCWIWE0aa	Deep inside he still wishes he was at Liverpoo, now hes stuck with a decent carlin cup/mickey mouse cup run every year.|`|4yBlEtaaaa	i think robbie keane's full of crap he say's he's a life long liverpool fan,but now he says he's back 'home'|`|jiFHJ6daaa	I dont think KEAne will play the last match|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	He scored twice at Anfield last season and looked pretty pleased about it!!        http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=6fwKeG7DBB...
d99GIH9Uaa	Haahaaa    Your right,if someone like Vidic did that it would be a 4 match ban|`|jiFHJ6daaa	not the matter................its 2-0|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	Honestly... Absolute insanity... To be fair it was a push with his foot.. not a blatent kick...But you cant put your studs in someones back....Should be punnished... But then so should have Ronney when he stamped on that bloke in the Champs league last month|`|RSJbqioUaa	Because Benayoun deserved it!  He wasn't even hurt! And if he was....he should have taken it like a MAN!|`|m7tjMSDCaa	who cares, he said he was sorry|`|TKDi70uTaa	it's a wierd one but apparantley because the ref never saw it at all and he never mentioned the incident in his notes nothing can be done about it. i did laugh though how many times have you wanted to see a player do that when teams hold the ball by the corner flag.|`|HxET88bDaa	I suppose i guess they wanted to brush the whole silly saga beneath the carpet. At the time i thought it was funny actually, he didn't hurt him but i guess according to the rules he should be sent off, he apologised after if that means anything, and now it is over...|`|zJCWIWE0aa	He was wearing blue not red|`|huto12P3aa	lol yep ur right, its because he plays for chelsea not manu, if it were evra doin that, he'd of got another 4 match ban again, cos the fa are gay|`|jXX4Tdq4aa	because of the catipilar eyebrow, that thing is scary I bet the FA is scared the unibrow will get them.|`|lkNJNnlSaa	He's got one eyebrow.    he should be fined and suspended, you don't do something like that and say ''oh sorry, i didn't mean to hurt him''.|`|rzPMzoxzaa	What about Alonso for kicking Lampard.The f.a.are a joke but an expensive one.what a gravy train.
AbkJZchdaa	No it happens to me ALL the time, don't worry about it.    Good luck and i hope i helped!!!|`|zmhQdYbDaa	Ideally all your hair should be in your swim cap because it reduces the drag of your hair in the water. But I do know that it does get pretty hard and annoying.    What I do is I use hair clips to get all of those pesky little hairs in my cap. I also wear my cap pretty low on my forehead and the back of my neck to make sure all of my hair is in the cap.|`|qB4KvbDiaa	is it really that hard

aIhVHfMUaa	HA! yeah good for a laugh, never thought about that one LOL<br>  <br>  No, i dont think so, you never hear him talk about it LOL<br>  <br>  EDIT: i guess he could be a fan, he would have enjoyed India winning the T20 World Cup last year and i bet i know how he would have celebrated<br>  <br>  With a CHAMPAGNE SQUISHEE!! LOL|`|kecdkv6jaa	He wouldn't have the time to watch any!!<br>  Running the Kwik-E-Mart is a lot of hard, time consuming work!!<br>  <br>  But i'm sure if he had a day off he'd love to watch a test match!, lol|`|HTiczN3Xaa	What's racist about this question, "Sanjay"?

ptQ5SkPVaa	Brandon is right, I don't really see JBL in a big match this year. He might face Kofi or Kane.|`|3k4tPNTGaa	If shawn micheals faces undertaker at wrestlemania dn he will go in money in d bank match and as looking heat behind him he cn even win this match.|`|5JQFCQCkaa	Him in a Battle for Brand Supremecy match, where the winner gets a world title shot. Possibly against The Great Khali or The Big Show, where he will lose.|`|XDuo03wEaa	Undertaker|`|5d79dc29abe4955a299c6732d5425041aa	Probably put him in the MITB match.|`|nfZzdWGLaa	Don't care he is s***|`|dfcwNAsOaa	a  diet<br>  <br>  really mvp id be cool|`|KH9bbeCNaa	his weight problems|`|EFhaEtL7aa	Screw JBL!!!

I dont see JBL in a big match this year. I'd like to see him go over Kofi Kingston.|`|6LQNK51uaa	A diva of his Caliber....like Beth or Jillian(they ve equal size)|`|41WXZPnCaa	Kane Or Punk
WkpOrF64aa	The new players won't be playing.  They are probably on flights, now, and everyone in the trade have to take physicals.  it'll probably be Saturday or Sunday, that they will be available.<br>  <br>  So, Knicks will have a reduced lineup, tomorrow.|`|NGYoZs1Kaa	well the lakers just traded vladimir and the new players were there at the next game . Phil(coach) doesnt want the rookies to play on their first game so they play in the 2nd game or however the knicks do it.
I1w0HfQbaa	There is simply not enough good things for me to say about 'The Dragon.' His matches with Ric Flair were classics and that is the only reason why I buy Ric Flair DVDs. Anything he does turns to gold. His Wrestlemania III Intercontinental title match with Randy Savage is still considered the top three on anyone's list of greatest wrestling matches in Wrestlemania. Yeah, it is that high. I loved his match with Steve Austin in Bash at the Beach 1994 for the US title. That match stole the show. <br>  <br>  The achilles heel for Ricky is he was a babyface, pure and simple. He simply was not a heel wrestler. He could not change his character even if he tried. It was not in his nature. Could you imagine Steamboat coming into the ring slamming Sting or Hulk Hogan with a steel chair? It would be unthinkable. Rick was the last of a dying breed in pro wrestling. He was a role model.|`|e3m3rdNYaa	Ricky Steamboat was an awesome wrestler, definatly one of my favorite ever. He was in one of the best Tag teams ever along with Jay Youngblood.<br>  <br>  Either WrestleWar 1989 vs. Ric Flair or when he and Youngblood won the NWA Tag team titles from Baron von Raschke and Paul Jones|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Great worker. Good babyface phsycology (sp?)...average mic skills.<br>  <br>  His match with Stunning Steve Austin at Clash of the Champions for the U.S. title was a great match. One of my favorites of his, and both men had great chemistry together|`|a0RgVoScaa	His matches with Jay Youngblood in Mid-Atlantic were really good. It's just sad that Youngblood passed away at such a young age. Steamboat seemed to be really affected by it. I liked their feud with Sgt.Slaughter and Don Kernodle.|`|1yOdrYiHaa	Ric Flair Vs Ricky SteamBoat :<br>  WrestleWar 1989 where they fought for the NWA World Heavyweight title.It was a fantastic match lasting over 30 minutes.Full of nonstop action, holds, counters and nearfalls with some excellent technical wrestling.Ric won the match and regained the NWA title from Steamboat with an Inside Cradle.After the match, Ric was attacked by Terry Funk after he turned down a title match with him , Also they had a great match Best of 3 falls match, personally. It was the longest and I really liked the controversial finish. According to Flair, they had matches at non-televised events that were better.|`|pYOPVivUaa	Steamboat Is Arguably One Of The Best and his Best of 3 with Flair. which can be found on the Best Of Ric Flair Collection. (the white copy) And if you can have great matches with Flair and I do mean Great and then have great matches with savage too then you are somebody. plus Flair Puttin You Over as one Of his Best opponents helps too.|`|e53470e0994050b004790b633a444bd4aa	Great in the NWA/WCW, wasted away in the WWF in the early 90's. McMoron thought he was a former champion of an inferior promotion and thus gave him the Dragon costume gimmick, which didn't take away from his ability but made him look like a circus freak. And his career ended too early.|`|3k4tPNTGaa	great wrestler he ws surely underrated, If he debut this time in professional wrestling worl dn he cn surely b a huge star.<br>  I like his match against ric flair.|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	The matches he had with Ric Flair for the NWA title. They are classic matches.<br>  <br>  Steamboat was a great technical wrestler plus he could climb the ropes.|`|GJ9z6K1Baa	def underrated..he just wasnt the ''merchandise seller'' like that lame hulk hogan|`|CQ9oxJXnaa	One of the best|`|znqX7je0aa	good rassler|`|1z7M3Tntaa	Haven't seen alot from him, but saw his macth against Greta Muta and there's no shadow of a doubt that he's a great wrestler|`|NRs72Afxaa	I've only seen a couple of SteamBoat matches against Macho Man and Muta and I have to say he is a good wrestler and you can consider him a legend in this business.<br>  <br>  I'm glad he is going into the Hall of Fame.
8jViRw5qaa	I'll give my top 3 from 2009 so far.<br>  1. SmackDown Elimination Chamber- HHH vs. Undertaker final 2, just a classic.<br>  <br>  2. Raw Elimination Chamber- First thing, E.C.'s are awesome and secondly I doubt any body thought that Edge would walk out WHC. Very unpredictable.<br>  <br>  3. Jeff Hardy vs. Edge(No DQ)- Not a good outcome but this started what I think will be the best storyline of the year. In the match we saw a Swanton Bomb, Spear, Twist o Fate, Whisper in the Wind, Vickie Guerrero(Excuse Me!!!) and a huge betrayal. <br>  <br>  Can't wait till' WM 25|`|NRs72Afxaa	There are 3 matches that  I liked.<br>  <br>  Here's the 3 list:<br>  <br>  1. Shelton Benjamen vs Undertaker smackdown shows: After a horrible feud with the Big Show. Shelton Benjerman made it all up. He made Undertaker look good.  Give Shelton a chance and he might prove that he can stick with the "Big Boys".<br>  <br>  2: Melina vs Beth Phoenix at RR: I really enjoyed their match as it was one of the best womens wrestling match that I haven't seen from Wwe a long time. <br>  <br>  3. The Raw and Smackdown and Elimination Chambers: I got to admit the results sucked/ shocking, but had good wrestling. Wwe should consider doing the Wargames this year. Just give it a chance.|`|JiCfYfLraa	the raw elimination chamber i guess its too early to tell the year just started.|`|fmUGHvgHaa	royal rumble|`|FEgAuxnzaa	My Three:<br>  (Not In My Fave Order)<br>  <br>  1. Maryse vs Michelle McCool - Divas Championship: Massive rivalry enfolded in the best match they had in there feud which finally Maryse won after she should have become first champ instead of McCool (She should have been in GAB 2008 match for divas championship<br>  <br>  2. SD EC - WWE Championship: Really the top 6 superstars of Smackdown going in a great colission inside tons of steel. Shocked when Edge went out first (But he won later, DAMN) eventually Triple H won, Him and Undertaker gave us a great last 5 or so minutes in the match.<br>  <br>  3. Royal Rumble - Royal Rumble Match: Really Good match as usuall a main eventer would win this match and one night return of RVD (wish he stayed for longer) and 2/3 of Legacy helped Orton pull out a victory eventually even though he tipped Triple H over the top rope without them.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	Jeff Hardy/Edge - RR.<br>  RAW EC Mini Match (Rey & Edge)<br>  Finlay/Thwagger - ECW<br>  HBK/Cena - RAW|`|w173betxaa	Cena vs HBK<br>  Jeff Hardy vs Edge(No DQ)<br>  WHC Championship EC(only because edge won it and the way cena got eliminated)|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	I think both matches between HBK and Cena were great.<br>  The Royal Rumble match itself was good.|`|T13xM9iJaa	Cena vs HBK|`|3ssA27jnaa	the royal rumble melina becoming women's champ and rvd returned|`|6LQNK51uaa	So far I think Smackdown's EC match is the best one...Shelton vs Undertaker comes next.|`|kJhZx5Mcaa	None so far|`|3k4tPNTGaa	If u r askin abt last i.e 2008 dn i wud go for shawn micheals and jericho in Ladder match and undertaker vs edge in tlc match<br>  <br>  If u r askin abt this  year's match dn i wud go with SD and raw elimination chambers, but wait as wrestlemania 25 is coming and i gt a clue dt every match of this wrestlemania is goin to b great.|`|TUURiVnraa	smackdowns elimination chamber then end was a classic match wen it was only hhh and undertaker and also couse of edges reaction wen he got eliminate that was priceless and hhh won that!! XD|`|0P40aUA0aa	HBK Vs Cena <br>  Shelton Vs Taker|`|25HCZmPZaa	personally i really liked kane and mike knox vs kofi and rey i really liked that but its still to early to say|`|5jIdcbyYaa	Randy Orton vs Shane <br>  There was finally blood and it reminded me a lot of the attitude era.|`|Cc4lc3qCaa	Royal rumble|`|GJ9z6K1Baa	my personal fav was shelton benjamin vs the undertaker|`|53986a54fb7e28986e6d815651923852aa	Shawn Michaels vs. John Cena<br>  Christian vs. Jack Swagger<br>  RAW elimination chamber|`|Pvg6djVSaa	royal rumble <br>  elimination chamber<br>  hbk vs cena :)
lPDHMOVZaa	Because they think they are gods gift to mankind... I mean, their fans call them "America's Team" for crying out loud. All that matters to the Dallas Cowboys is that their fans show up to the games with a bead of drool coming out of their mouths and their eyes crossed while they try to hump the players legs... They don't care if they win or lose as long as the fans are there to boost their egos and remind them that they are the best team in the world even when they go 2-14...|`|Awfv7TV3aa	Wade Phillips. Bring in Gruden and that's a disciplined team|`|yAvTxh47aa	As I said in your other question: Labgrrl lives in Buffalo. Enough said.|`|z6pdWKa5aa	Because their players are so talented. I know, how can all those players being good be a problem? Becuase, they all find themselves as being the best. But having the best players doesn't mean they work together as a team. Nuff said.|`|KzqBIj4aaa	They suck because they play in the toughest division!! Eagles, Giants, Redskins!!!|`|ULw1777caa	How much time ya got?|`|90ZaNZE4aa	bad coaching and very bad chemistry due to some players|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Jerry Jones, Wade Phillips, TO...just to name 3...|`|AA10939368	The biggest team of me's in the NFL, evidence to that is the Pittsburgh Steelers.  They have heart and loyalty to the Rooney's, their coaches, each other and the fans.    They also have a leader and his name Arthur Rooney Sr. and he is smiling down from heaven.|`|rjuqrHK7aa	They have to many distractions. Jerry Jones gets a lot of attention. Terrell Owens gets just as much. Pacman get some. Tony Romo and Jessica Simpson get some. Your hear to much about individuals and not the overall team.|`|QIWvbNFWaa	Blame Al Davis|`|2RzOqHObaa	the coach isnt doin to well i think  go to www.myspace.com/codydcshoes|`|AUHsZvavaa	They suck because they are completely dysfunctional. They are a group of individual players, and don't play like a team.|`|aeApup5oaa	Jerry Jones is the reason.|`|2pOMWZtKaa	Leadership and chemistry.  Off the field you have an owner who isn't smart enough to realize he doesn't know enough to be as involved as he is.  When you have that much money, you are surrounded by yes men and begin to believe your own press as they say.  It isn't an accident that he hired someone as head coach who's IQ is clearly lower than his...another poor leadership move which points to insecurity.  Good leaders surround themselves with smart people.    On the field Tony Romo is simply too soft to be an effective NFL leader.  From fainting in the shower to off the field distractions at key points during the season, I wouldn't want my franchise hanging on him.  T.O. must go as well.
yAvTxh47aa	Labgrrl lives in Buffalo.    Nuff said.|`|IQZNkeNzaa	Detroit|`|j6YWA3Qnaa	every bad team needs something good to root for.|`|Q2S4w8xZaa	I'd say Seattle. Their baseball tem has never been to the World Series, they just spent $117 Million last year and lost over 100 games. Their NBA Basketball team just lost 62 games AND relocated to Oklahoma City.NCAA Football? Nope. huskies lost 12 games last year. yeah, 0-12. First time in the history of the pac-10. Oh, and every single manager/head coach left or was fired. And, yeah, the Seahawks were 4-12. I'm a Boston sports fan, but for god's sake, Seattle fans need a break. They deserve a better team, *somewhere*!|`|JpvXhgmraa	Oakland. Raider fans come out every 8 games, just to watch their team get destroyed. They put their paint on, and crazy outfits, and still only get like 4 wins a year. I fell for Raider fans|`|m9Hmb93Uaa	browns|`|b7e052679df0f05c6133177c5038927daa	The Bengals, the Browns and (my favorite)the Saints!|`|AA12103453	I'd say the Lions. The fans are loyal, for some reason, so they deserve better.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	i really think the browns need a revival|`|sYEf626Aaa	I would say the Browns, it was not their fault Modell left with the team|`|rjuqrHK7aa	Cincinnati. We have supported our team through bad ownership and off-field problems. We just need a new owner.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	The Lions, imo|`|QE77Oxtqaa	The Cincinnati Bengals, without a doubt. They have sucked for so long  it's pathetic. My Colts fan hubby likes to bust my chops about it.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	Oakland... Raiders fans are psychotic... how about giving them a reason to act so ridiculous other than a 5-11 record.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	Chicago|`|AA10939368	As a Pittsburgh Steelers fan I would say the Cleveland Browns.  They have stuck with their team for years and are as loyal as any fanbase around.|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	Possibly biased first choice: Jets  Unbiased second choice: Bills    I definitely feel like we deserve a better team, but if not us, the Bills' fans deserve better.    They'll come to the games in below-zero weather, in a blizzard, from hours away, to support their team.    I'd like to see them win a Super Bowl, those fans deserve it.|`|6KZgeq3Maa	i think all fans of any perennial losers deserve a better team.  They stick with their teams through the thick and thin.  Every true fan deserves to feel what it is like to root for a winner every now and then.  Top of my list Lions and Browns.  Browns fans are as diehard as they come. Detroit fans need something to root for, especially with the hardships their area has been under lately.|`|4fTiCNiKaa	Deserves? Well, poor Cleavland sure could. But by far I would have to say Oakland. Great, rabbid, faithfaul fans. And for what? Mr Davis gotta go.    Another good question could be "What non-NFL city deserves a team?". My vote would be...OKC!    BTW,    (\_(\  (=' :') --  (,(")(")    Elder Greg  ~SFECU~  pray4revival|`|HNE7dJQiaa	Chiefs, dedicated|`|UNVJWxTmaa	Eagles.  Philadelphia fans are so loyal.  They deserve a winner.|`|OLESQtjJaa	Browns|`|uciKplrVaa	oakland... god help 'em
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	He's an extremely gifted and charismatic Superstar who works an excellent style of technical Lucha Libre wrestling and can put on an entertaining match.Y2J is very talented on the mic and can cut awesome promos and in-ring segments.He's one of my favorite WWE wrestlers and is a legend of the Attitude Era.|`|2FKHNIB2aa	Greater and more powerful then Chuck Norris|`|dcNT65mTaa	When he's a face, he's more entertaining, but when he's a heel, he wins more. We all remember his confrontations with the Rock where they would trade catch phrases and insults. It was what stepped him into the big leagues cause Vince won't have an uncharismatic champ. He's always had the in ring skills cause as hell or face, he can beat u without cheating.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	One of the best. Heel or face everyone pays attention to Jericho and he always delivers, he is one of the best around and should be mentioned in the same breath as many of the greats.|`|AA11482019	A whiner.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	fututre HOF there's no doubt about that|`|pmjOiQFvaa	an in-ring magician a great heel charachter which has been resurrected in to his second stint with wwe which is excellent and as always his excellent ability on the mic and delivering amazing promo work.  note:didnt 2008 describe anything for you regarding Y2J.    but other then that he is a very honest man lol and you people hate that lol|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Talented|`|J2bLQcHNaa	Some Hardcore ***** You Wouldn't want to **** with him.|`|mKb0VsHDaa	Talenting and Exciting.|`|bOAJBQP3aa	God|`|m9Hmb93Uaa	cocky|`|AA11230418	A good heel wrestler|`|J1qHRS07aa	Amazing.|`|fwtq3bQ3aa	he is a total loser
UxooffHZaa	LeBron was a good Tight End in high school. So, I'd have to go with him. But, either, if they put their minds to it, could be fairly successful WRs, in my opinion.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	LeBron, not even close. He has the size and strength over Kobe.|`|JKQKG3tQaa	Larry Fitzgerald|`|FHxz6lmraa	lebron|`|OLESQtjJaa	LeBron James is a better all round player|`|SjCVIOzcaa	LeBron James went to St. Vincent - St. Mary High School in Ohio where he actually played WR he was deemed All State WR and was scouted by colleges to play. So not only was he on the road to the NBA but could have been in a BCS bowl game. So i'd pick Lebron.|`|j6YWA3Qnaa	lebron, but yao over both of them. haha|`|m9Hmb93Uaa	lebron|`|6J5mQWj0aa	lebron the man child he can jump we would just have to work on speed and his hands|`|8aa98ddf90b585cbbccc7bd34c260043aa	Lebron is taller, bigger, more athletic, and likely faster.   So Im going to have to go with James.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	LeBron played football in HS. I think he was a Tight End  and he'd be a great one still, rather than a wide out.

Although, a few times the weathers been nice and I've went outside a few times and I sucked it up during the cold and played but really I miss having my driveway and taking shots whenever I want not just on days that its warm.

Anything they could do wrong they probably are doing wrong.|`|r4a376Ocaa	This is very creative and i like it, but kinda extreme, maybe not for FMF but perhaps for leagues that are growing and need to show they have what it takes, to be called a "professional" league.|`|c6H2GC9kaa	thats a good idea it would motivate the players to play better and score more.....but i agree with the first answer as well...the porcentaje system kinda sucks|`|2P6VDNwSaa	I think it would be horrible.

NRs72Afxaa	I think this Main Event Mafia is playing possum about a possible disband, but that's my opinion. I just don't think this storyline should end just yet. Ever since this storyline happened they've been getting 1.2 ratings. <br>  <br>  I just don't think its time for this storyline to end. I think Sting will hold on to the World Title until Slammiversary, Samoa Joe will likely get his match with Nash around this Summer,  Scott Steiner will be a punching bag, and Booker will retain his Legends title. That's just my opinion.|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	Yes, my friend. The Main Event Mafia is starting to break at it seams. Tonight's fight between Sting and Angle is just the beginning of the end the MEM.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|FGmEoXw9aa	Nah, the situation will be that they will all help Booker T retain the Legends title, And everyone one of them is in the ring looking at each other and Kurt and Nash will look at the rest of the guys and say " Ahhhh come here you guys, much respect players, you guys are the best", and they all lift up their hands" And Mike Tenay and Don West start blabbing on, " Here you have it folks, MEM is stronger than ever, what will the future hold for these powerful individuals, will it be the power, fame, or fortune, we'll find out next time on......... TNA Impact...." Don West; " Yes we will Mike, and it will be one heck of a show, MEM in your face and in TNA..."|`|11i3Xmb1aa	Maybe. Especially of how Kurt and Sting are.

dDhTMacAaa	Awwww, man I was kidding!<br>  <br>  Just having some fun, I'm truly sorry if I offended you, because I don't like when people hate on my team.<br>  <br>  No disrespect, sorry again man.|`|Njom1Wbtaa	I have no idea why people like that exist for some reason, maybe free will.<br>  <br>  The Pistons is on the brink of falling to the playoffs right now, the worst part was they didn't made any trade at all. They have many quality players on that team that they could trade and accumulate cap space. Richard Hamilton doesn't fit with the chemistry right now, and Stuckey is not the next franchise player. <br>  <br>  "To be a next franchise player, you must have the playing time to do so," the Pistons is in jeopardy right now because of their complex roster. It would be surprising if they can win 50 games or 46 plus games on this season.|`|sitkfn5Maa	I know Pistons are pretty good still i think they need an extra player to help them out, they'll make it to the playoffs again just dont know how far theyll go. they should be making fun of the suns with all there problems and old guys on the team.|`|F1xpcJ2Laa	who?<br>  <br>  OOH HIM ..lol... he's a good guy ...we are all sad tho|`|JpvXhgmraa	because.......they might not make the playoffs, and have one of the best teams in the league.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	Detroit is still good and can always be a threat|`|SyY83mEGaa	idk dude. i am spurs fan and they get made fun of too. those people who make those songs are just haters|`|Lpf6Eu3eaa	they sold out to the man bro..............very anti Black Panther.......feeel me|`|Ry4Jc96Aaa	i agree completely with that detroit pistons guy.<br>  this is the first year we haven't been playing like ususal and everyone comes on here saying pistons suck what happened to the piston and all of this ****. one season is not that big of a deal, although if they dont make the playoff ill be pissed.<br>  UNLIKE 99% OF THE PEOPLE ON HERE (CELTICS FANS) i will always support them, whether they win 1 game or 70. hey thats one plus side of the lions, they taught me to always support hahhah<br>  whatever i still love<br>  DEEEEEEEEEEEETROIT BASKETBALLLLLLLLLLLLLL :)|`|uUU6XBhfaa	Okay i agree with you. Imma Pistons fan and even if we suck this year, next year we are gonna have some really good players cause of the free cap space.<br>  <br>   AND, everyone knows half of the people on Y/a are bandwagoners. Probably 85% of them root for the celtics, lakers, or cavs even when they have no affiliation with them.|`|NmXKPDoIaa	They are over .500 why would I make fun of them?<br>  <br>  -Pistons fans just have really high expectations. I was thrilled when the Hawks went 37 - 45 last year.|`|HNQU9V6Haa	its nice to go to 6 east finals but how many nba finals have they won since they been on that streak? exactly only one they are the nbas atlanta braves of the 90s|`|ISQAWUf2aa	im not,i blame the coach of pistons something seams strange,it like they purposly lose,the coach should get fired.|`|u2QhQAxzaa	Dude, cause the Pistons suck.  Should of never traded Chanucey Billups.  After they did that, I decided to not like them anymore.  How can u trade your Captain/Leader.  Now they are paying for it.<br>  <br>  And, don't u know, no one likes the Pistons.|`|f2hfuMKFaa	uhh cuz they suck duh. GO LAKERS!!!!|`|50bEHtYfaa	Im not a Pistons fan, but I do like the Pistons. I think they have a well balanced team and A.I makes a great addition to the team. I watched the game tonight and it was very close. It was a good game as well. The people that are hating are probably the bandwagoners. Pistons have made it to the playoffs for over 5 years in a row now. Boston bandwagoners are going to hate, but there team hadnt made it to the play offs in a long time until they got Garnett, and Allen. I think Pistons are a good team though, even though I am not a Pistons fan. My team is doing horrible (Wizards) because all of are starters are injured except 1. But no worries well be better next year when everyone is healthy.|`|wDdwYqazaa	They should i of never trader chancey. They should of trader Rip for some1 like vince or even iverson and get a low post threat cause Raheed trys to play on the perimeter and he isnt that good cause he shoot uder 45% which os bad for a bigman|`|mD6Wv0SYaa	true they are a good team still. Perhaps ppl are getting revenge from getting beat by them for so long!|`|Lxj6kMklaa	Cause one coach destroyed the whole team
4cJuKxJbaa	He will end up with the Dodgers this is all barganing now. Look at the Yankees & Pettite...they were said to have somewhere around 30-40% chance of getting a deal done & once the barganing was over it was all forgotten about. He will be back with the Dodgers & Dunn will go to the Nationals the next day!|`|yk4S7uuraa	I think the Mets now have a legitimate shot at getting him, something will happen before spring training begins.|`|vv1JvGjwaa	I think the Mets because Omar loves him. The Wilpons never told Omar not to sign him because Omar never asked them. Since Omar was focused on pitching that is now complete since they sined Perez they have 7 good startes now and their bullpen is just about done too.  I think Manny will sign a 2 year deal worth around 50 to 55 million with an option|`|1OeNP92yaa	Any one can just say the Yankees but i am going to go with the nationals. They are in desperate need of everything you want to start rebuilding get the best hitter in baseball. Manny plus add some pazazz to the lineup manny will bring lots of energy to the team. Thats what they need|`|DkwgogXZaa	the mets|`|l0iCqzlQaa	yankees|`|okV8A1Ayaa	At home on the couch watching the Red Sox win it all!!|`|m9Hmb93Uaa	yankees
io3hggzZaa	i think they should but wont.|`|ak5A435maa	yeah|`|wKXUfedMaa	No, there is not "official proof".  His former trainer has said he has kepy syrignes that has clemens' blood on them.  Not only can this be fabricated but the fact is what was in the syringes.     Nothing official has occured.
IITnJjAjaa	Before sprinting, you don't need to stretch, you need to jog to get your legs warmed up. Stretching is actually beneficial after running. It is also scientifically proven that static stretching before sprinting slows you down! The best time to stretch is following your workout as part of your cool-down. It's a great way to restore tissue length. It will also help bring your body back to a state of rest and recovery.<br>  <br>  **It's all about arm action and leg strides. Practice bounding with huge strides, or even skipping as high as you can. Swing your arms hip to lip; ideally, your elbows should be shoulder high when you swing back.<br>  <br>  **The first few meters are key: a strong, explosive takeoff, with short, quick steps. Push off the ground hard. Or your starting blocks, if you're on a track. Work on getting a great deal of muscular strength in your legs and your core (abdominal, pectoral, trapezius, etc) muscles strong and big, which can be done by doing fewer repetitions with heavier weights (if you were training for long distance you'd work out for endurance and would do light weights with tons of reps.)<br>  <br>  **Watch professional sprinters for technique, etc. A lot of it is natural but there are some aspects of sprinting you can train for.<br>  <br>  *Downhill sprint training works. Here is how it works: Moving your workout to a downhill slope will increase speed by an average of two-tenths of a second.<br>  <br>  The pull of gravity will force you to run faster than you would be able to prevent falling. It is important to concentrate on good form and drive while running downhill.<br>  <br>  **Cycling is great for sprinters- it builds up the calf muscles and uses muscles that you don't build up as much just running.|`|CLOziQHLaa	just start running in the morning or<br>  jog in place|`|d1Y0cZumaa	That means you haven't been working out a lot lately and I guess all you need is more practice to get your body used to the running conditions. If you have asthma, it might slow you down or make your body not react good enough to running which is a put down but you can still get 1st place on any event. Good Stretches are touching your toes, bending your knees, and getting that blood flow through all those body parts to keep them fresh.. hope this helps.|`|vXkPUOWdaa	be fats very fast its all in the legs
QlrIUIfOaa	No, but I care about the issue.    Prohibition does not work. The fools who keep drugs illegal are directly responsible for muggings, murder, the Mexican border/gang situation, poppy fields in Afghanistan and all the other "unintended consequences" that go along with criminalizing drugs.    The fact that Phelps did something "illegal" or "tarnished" the present value of his marketing cash flow is all man-made garbage.  The underlying act is a non-event.  Anyone that looks at an athlete as a role model is a fool.  Phelps is a great swimmer, perhaps the best ever: so what.  After listening to him speak I concluded he is dumb as a post.      I will choose the folks I recommend to my children as role models - if you want an athlete, I choose Kurt Warner.  And that choice has nothing to do with touchdown passes.|`|n4tPArAAaa	dunno him|`|TEX1iYQgaa	When you grow up and get past the "who cares, everybody does it" phase of life, you'll understand why this is such a big deal.    Because of Michael Phelps' awesome accomplishments he has been thrust into the limelight, and sponsors have stepped all over themselves in order to attach his name to their products. In the world that Michael Phelps now lives, image is everything. We have been sold an image of a squeaky clean American boy with his eyes full of wonder as he won gold medal after gold medal. That's the image his sponsors want, and that's what they paid a lot of good money for.    Consequently, because of his popularity, he can't get away with stupidity ~ it becomes public knowledge. His sponsors aren't happy with the new tarnished image, and we've been shown a Michael Phelps that we didn't know existed. This new image isn't going to sell products, and his sponsors are going to end up finding someone else to hitch their wagon to.     In a nutshell, a good boy has gone bad. An American hero is no hero after all ~ that's the news story ~ not to mention the fact that he was a positive role model...|`|oBmLIDHtaa	I think he should smoke more.|`|3wAkbWqSaa	yea, i couldnt bleave tht he would do tht,,.........omg tht is so sad 4 him..........thre goes his carrear.......    =(|`|IWPcs8kaaa	ya who cares he is 23 he will try that kind of stuff|`|KzqBIj4aaa	Everyone should care because if they don't do anything about it then that favoritism. If that were a NBA, NFL, or MLB player, there would be all types of fines and endorsement loses!!!|`|j0H2m6zUaa	I couldn't care less. At 23 I was ripping the occasional bong hit too. Pot smoking is fine in moderation. MT- I can only assume that your answer is a joke.|`|LLaudCPIaa	Not as much as the DUI he received a few years back. Smoke and drink all you want, but dont get behind the wheel and drive.|`|AA11388450	I've never really cared that much about Phelps but to know that there are millions of people who think of him as a sort of role model for his swimming work that he's done and to now see him using drugs could be disastrous for his reputation and renown.    There have been a lot of studies and research done that have shown that pot use doesn't give you an edge in swimming so his medals from Beijing are likely not going to come into the picture any time during this whole fallout but then again the question must be raised: was he using banned substances (of any kind) while he was in China? China is known for its production of ginseng which has become a highly questionable substance in these days and other herb-derived substances from China are very controversial.    Basically there are a lot of things that have to be done before a final decision about what his sponsors should do can be made. I don't expect this to go away for a while and for all we know this could very easily escalate into something like MLB's investigation into steroids.|`|qB4KvbDiaa	why should we he is grown, and can make his own decisions
SLoCe1wcaa	I lived in Northern Canada for many years and a backyard rink just meant that you boarded off a section of snowy backyard and ran water into it and made a skating rink.

WjpHrJdFaa	The saddle pad is what goes under the saddle. Some horses need a different pad because they have a reaction to the material of the pad. Saddle pads are basically all one size. There might be a smaller one for a pony, and a bigger one for a draft horse though. Same with saddles, bridles, etc.    Saddle size does matter. Take your old saddle and measure from the horn, to the highest part of the back of the saddle (your seat). That is the size of the saddle that fits you, for example, my saddle is 16". Also, some saddles will hurt a horses back. You can find someone who is experienced and help you pick out a saddle. Like have them watch you ride with a new saddle on or something..    Tack is basically everything you use for your horse. Bridle, saddle, saddle pad, anything, this is all tack.    Be careful of what kind of saddle you get. I recently purchased a saddle over the internet and I got ripped off, so just be careful if your getting one over the internet. Make sure you like it, and make sure there IS a return policy. Look into information about what kind of saddle you are getting. Like the namebrand of it. Or like I said, have an experienced person help you.    Hope I answered all your questions!|`|jExNAyvxaa	i dont  like western riding

IK8VW4FZaa	Gilmour's banner was raised a few weeks ago.  The last time we really had a chance. Such a great time to be a Toronto sports fan.  The Blue Jays won back to back World Series.  I remember being at baseball games at the Dome in the spring and following the Leaf game by the score board.  The crowd would cheer when the Leafs would score a goal.  I was at a party in Wasaga Beach on Victoria day weekend when the Leafs won game 5 against the Kings to go up 3 games to 2.  I puked on the floor.  In our minds we were already in the cup final.  It was euphoria.  <br>  <br>  The Gilmour years and to some way the Sundin years were a refreshing change from the years when Harold Ballard owned the team.  On Saturday we will have the pleasure of being able to welcome Mats back to the place where his heart is.  I hope he gets the love that he deserves from the fans.  The years under Ferguson Jr were a waste, even though I have much respect for him and his father.  This year and probably the next couple seasons will be quite bad, but I have trust in Burke and I think the future of the Leafs is bright.<br>  <br>  Look at the Hawks.|`|LYGV6QNBaa	LOL....I wouldn't know Barry but that is what you claim and I will take your word for it.|`|M6P7r57faa	Maybe the groundhog should be their new mascot!|`|AA11916920	I feel the same way home in Columbus.<br>  Tough game tonight.<br>  <br>  Congrats to Ken Hitchcock and NHL win #500!!!|`|xIx1XrGfaa	If that's the case, I've been enjoying spring since September.

mG2BCZe7aa	2nd time around that the Bulls get him from the Knicks... I was also getting those questions, especially after getting Jerome James a wasteful player in the package... I like the work they did yesterday but this trade sucks... I think Larry could help us more down the stretch if we kept him at least for this play-off push, I think Pax wanted Larry's a-s-s out of the Bulls line-up immediately and instead of constructing the team he polluted the ball club again with cancer players.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|JThgHiaoaa	Larry Hughes was a whiney reserve that complained when he didn't get court time or the ball.<br>  <br>  Tim Thomas is going to be a back-up for the Centers and PF's already in the team and if he does complain, he hasn't got much to back himself up. They do now have 13 players and can always bench him :)|`|13XU8cCKaa	They were trying to give the Knicks a favor.|`|j0YJX8U6aa	he is a future star

Chelski 2nd Liverpool won't stay the distance and will finish 3rd. 4th will be interesting as the Gooners are so inconsistent - could it be Villa??    Who will be relegated - the richest club in the world?|`|ccXJo7xUaa	Hopefully Man Utd, but itll be a good push to the finish, with 3 or 4 points in it.    Hope Aston Villa can keep it up and finish above Arsenal.|`|7e76bf014097e913315078f97333c60aaa	Manchester United are looking pretty ominous.  They are winning games and just not conceding, and they are also coming into form in the second half of the season, which is what they have done countless times before.  I know Liverpool beat Chelsea the other day, but you have to look at the bigger picture: they have had some very inconsistent results this season, and the win over Chelsea could have been the result of a lot of mental focus and motivation, built up over a period of time.
CFQbdDRNaa	Broke huh? Don't know what to do? The wilderness is not your answer. Many a man has gone to the mountains hoping to get something he couldn't find on the flats! Perhaps you're thinking...it ought to had been different. Maybe, You are around 25 yrs old and you think you have hard times....I checked your profile, you should realize anyone can look back at your questions and discern what and who they are dealing with.....You cant learn what you need from a video or a web site for what you're thinking.

Personally, I learnt how to survive the Canadian wilderness by camping (like, real camping, no trailers or electricity or any of that shenanigans.)   It's so fun! just do it. As long as you can say dry, the proper temperature, hydrated and fed, you'll survive.   Learn what you can eat around you and how to build proper shelter and you're good to go!|`|OrG2fBbKaa	Common sense, go out and do it.  Do this before you have any descendants. If you survive long enough to have a family you deserve to survive.  The only way to do it is DIY.|`|XJSOToRGaa	Watching TV is great but honestly your best bet is to get involved with a local survival/camping group.  YOu don't want to start off by just getting dumped in the middle of the woods with a knife, 2 matches, and an empty coffee can the way the guys on TV do it.  Learn to walk before you learn to run: Try camping in a remote area that isnt TOO remote...there's a town called millinocket in Maine that was great for this: nobody around for a few hundred yards, but if you got into trobule you still had cell phone reception and people not too far off.  After that its a matter of practicing your skills, buying the right tools, reading the right books, and not eating the wrong mushrooms :p|`|h2KkiKK3aa	youtube has a lot of good videos on the subject, what your looking for are survival and bushcraft videos.|`|3Twg9Uuuaa	If your young enough for the Boy Scouts of America Join up. Great opportunities there. Many hiking camping groups like the Sierra club offer training afield and sporting good stores as well such as REI and others. Definitely don't go alone and learn together with a trusted friend. Enjoy the experience|`|qyATAaeXaa	I received my very basic survival training in the Boy Scouts and my dad taught me to hunt. I took more advanced survival training later on when I became an backpacking guide and I've picked up a lot of "Climate Specific" survival training just through other courses on different subjects. I'm now learning about mushrooms and edible plants with a co-worker who is a Master Herbalist.    There's only so much you can learn from books and watching TV. You'll either want to take some classes at a survival school or join an organization that offers survival training. (Scouting, JROTC if you are young enough; Civil Air Patrol, A local EMS group, or Coast Guard Axillary if you are an adult.)|`|pOMd7c8Xaa	Watch man vs wild, and survivor man, he tells you every thing you need to know, lol.|`|8ENRWmoMaa	watch survivor man and man vs wild, to get general tips, take a survival class for a more in depth knowledge.
thcr8Y5vaa	LA Lakers...|`|xhHfXuKFaa	it goes down between lakers and celtics. but since the lakers have WAY more finals appearances i say its L.A.|`|AA11488609	the Celtics, they won more ships than anyone else and won the Finals in every decade over the last 50 years except the '90's.  The Lakers are 2nd, Knicks are 3rd, and the Spurs are 4th.    EDIT: Thumbs down for the truth?  No pun intended.  Until the Lakers win another 5 in a row, the Celtics are still  1.  The Knicks are  3 because of their financial success and the great players they've had throughout the decades, and the Spurs are 4th because they are the best team in the NBA over the last 10 years, and they also had some great teams over the '80's with Gervin and '90's with David Robinson.|`|3teWTOPqaa	L.A Lakers|`|KdhNCnEjaa	I dont think there are many teams you can argue for. The answer is the Boston Celtics. We have 17 banners swinging from the rafters. Our franchise had had 32 hall of famers over its rich history.

It is not just because we win, it is the winning tradition and the people in the crowd who die a little bit every time the Celtics miss a shot.    EDIT: To add a couple things, the first African-American player, Chuck Cooper, Celtics. African-American coach? Also the Celtics, Bill Russell. Where would the game be today without integration?

5r91BIszaa	You will more than likely be brought up to varsity if you were on it before. But don't stress out so much! When I used to play, I used to do the same thing and if I messed up once I would get really frustrated and would keep making mistakes and it would just get worse from there. Just know that you can only do your best and if they don;t like it, keep trying until you get where you want! Good luck though! And relax =]|`|uFgNrY0Kaa	if you were brought up to jv that means they saw something in you. they know your good. don't worry. and if you don't make it to varsity set a new goal for yourself. like go for team caption. that's what I'm doing. It makes you want to play hard all the time and be a leader. And that always makes you look good. and don't worry about tryouts. If you know your good, your coaches will know.|`|NP6ytPfxaa	grow some balls, quit being a girl, no 1 likes softballs anyways...wanna go out wit me?|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	From the sound of it, you seem like a very talented softball player.

3906124cfbe15ee474641dd5c529df6caa	That's easy lol    Roberto Duran: At lightweight he was a monster, at the time he was virtually unstoppable and he managed to do well even at the welter weight level even though in that weight class he was often the smaller man, people forget that hearns and Hagler were much bigger than he was and much stronger,not many lightweights of his time had the balls to move up in weight and face those guys.    Aaron Pryor: The hawk has a record of 39 fights and 1 loss, he fought against most of the top welterweights of his time and dominated his division in a manner that had not been seen since the days of joe louis's bum of the month club. His bouts with arguello have reached near legendary status and there is little doubt that he is easily one of the best pound for pound fighters of all time, as a matter of fact the only reason i put Duran above him is because Duran faced extremely tough competition during his day, and dominated the lightweight division in equally devastating fashion.    Shane  Mosley: I know many people have doubts about him because of the doping scandal,but it amazes me how quickly people forget that that this guy not only has skills but heart. He was undefeated in 34 fights before winning the lightweight IBF title from holiday and went on to defend it nine times before moving up in weight,dominating that division while doing it,he then moved up and completely dominated a prime de la hoya to win the title and then beat him again in their second bout. He lost to forrest twice and as usual many boxing fans turned their backs on him and said he was done...he went on to to face many other greats like wright and then bounced back defeating mane resepcted fighters like collazo and vargas before losing to cotto. people turned their backs on him again just to watch him bounce back and defeat Margarito,the man with the iron chin that had defeated Cotto. His career is full of ups and downs but no one can deny his achievements,the guy is a champion and almost a guaranteed hall of famer,it's hard to make a case against him.    James Toney: Personally i like james toney more than mosley but mosley's record and comptetion puts him ahead. Toney is a man i admire for his technical skills, he was crafty,smart and actually approached boxing as a science not a blood sport. This guy was a middleweight who was beating up heavyweights and making them look bad, he went against greats like holyfield and came out succesful, he does have a few questionable losses that in my opinion he could have avoided but overall this guy is the real deal (no offense evander lol) at middleweight he was second perhaps only to roy jones and throughout his career in those divisions he was always a force to be reckoned with. So far his heavyweight career isn't all that but he does have some good wins in this weight class and it is important to remember that this guy is not that big of a heavyweight yet he goes against tough hitters like peters and holds his own...i think he is going to end up in the hall of fame at some point his record and opposition as well as beautiful style should get him there.    as usual,great question peter H.|`|RBjcvsTkaa	shane mosley ,aaron pryor ,robert duran then james toney|`|rU3pioImaa	I agree with Big E|`|6QhACK70aa	1 roberto  2 aaron pryor  3 toney    i can not rank mosley i have been an athlete and i am allergic to cheaters and people who use steroids!  if any of u has been an athlete, then u definatelly know THAT THERE IS NOT SUCH A THING AS:"I USED these pills but i aint knew they were steroids"|`|2MqaBfkxaa	Toney was at his lightest a middleweight,  these other guys were lightweights & welterweights.  If you're just asking to rank regardless of weight class I would say.    1. Roberto Duran  2. Shane Mosley  3. Aaron Pryor   4. James Toney
JpvXhgmraa	With the way the Pistons and Lions have been playing, or played,........yes. It could be worse, you could have been a Hawk fan for the past Decade.........|`|hzDCBXEyaa	The good news is that you have Dumars as your GM.  Most guys would have made a panic trade at the deadline today.  He didn't get a decent offer for his expiring contracts and wasn't willing to take on other teams' bad decisions.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that the Lions have dug such a deep hole for themselves that I don't know when they pull themselves out of this shame spiral.  At least Millen is gone (as a TV analyst!).  In answer to your question, is it possible?

XQoH9ZI5aa	1. They need somebody to put butts in the seats....as you said, he is a UFA after NEXT YEAR.....there is a long time to go before then!     2. Not being a Kovulchuk fantasy owner, it doesn't really affect me whether his stats are hurt or helped by it.........of course there is no denying that a change of scenery wouldn't help him. His wallet certainly isn't hurting.       Something you need to realize is that the Thrashers NEED TO KEEP Kovalchuk because they need to keep above the salary cap minimum.....if they let him walk they need to pick up another high end FA to get up the the cap floor.......if they trade him then they need to do it for large salaries for the same reason. I see him staying put for this reason......they have to spend some money somewhere so it might as well be on him.     Also, because they are terrible this year doesn't mean they will be by the time he is a FA....always reminds me of guys in baseball who left for "greener pastures" only to see their former team win alot of ballgames.....ARod and Griffey Jr. left Seattle then they went on to win over 100 games. Especially with the parity today.|`|9vLzGwVqaa	They should keep Kovalchuck!|`|naZQqrNeaa	1)  As stated before, people need a reason to go to the game and actually want to support the team.  Yes, they are doing the right thing.    2)  Yes, his numbers will dip......but his stock will rise.  Look at Sundin.  Good player that has become an idol.|`|G33E41IBaa	If Kovalchuk goes, there's no one left on the team to care about, and their fan base will go straight down the toilet.  I mean, let's face it; he's the only bright spot of the team right now.  It's probably hurting Kovalchuk because he has so much potential to do even better, a lot of talent, and has nothing to show for it.|`|9GzkVwfGaa	yes|`|fd747af047fac4ce6b0786a13d942ae6aa	They should not trade him.  The problem with the team is not him.  They need a new GM and Coach, that know what they are doing.  They have made so many bad trades, and free agent signings in the past.  They need some good hockey people running the show.  If they decide to trade him, then so be it.|`|LEQowzHCaa	nope. they should trade him for some prospects and draft picks...|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	Oh how fortunes change. The Thrashers were on the verge of something special a few seasons ago but it has all fallen apart. They absolutely have to move Kovalchuk at the deadline where every contending team will be bidding for his services to bring in a legitimate sniper. The fans there want a wining product. As electric as he can be, Kovalchuk's one or two goals on occasion is not enough to sell out the building. Atlanta needs to get younger and build with draft picks. Are you telling me his presence is filling the building? Move the one chip you've got to signify the rebuilding process is underway. Several teams will cough up a package that includes young prospects and draft picks. It's a start.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Any team needs a marketable fan favorite. To deal him would basically tell fans, "don't bother showing up," so the club is doing the right thing.

Y3KMLdjWaa	This is a fun question because this is what I do. I have a road bike and compete on a mtn bike. Here is my 2 cents worth, I have several set of rims for my mtn bike, one set has slick road tires on them. During the week the first few days I ride my road bike but as it gets closer to race day my road bike collects dust. As pointed out you ride what you race, the reason for riding the road bike has nothing to do with areo, when training this is not a factor, mph is nothing more than a meaningless reference point when training, the reason for the road bike is to keep wear to a min. on my race bike. You want to spend the most time on what you race, riding other types of bikes is fine but the focus should be towards riding what you race. As a side note there are certain types of training routines that are done easier on a road bike in the drop-outs. In the end it really doesn't matter on what bike your on as long as your on one. When spinning the cranks at 90rpm and putting out 200 watts it doesn't matter if you are going 15 or 30mph, the work is the same.|`|Z5xgSATSaa	For long training rides, a well fitted road bike is more comfortable than a mountain bike. Cyclists often train by riding together in groups, riding a mountain bike would make it impossible to keep up when the speeds were high, since mountain bikes don't have the gears for high road speeds. If you race on a road bike you need to train and adapt yourself for riding on that bike. Training on a mountain bike won't mean that you will get stronger, it will mean that your speeds on training ride will be slower. Your effort wouldn't be more, most cyclists use heart rate monitors and power meters for training, there would be no difference if they used mountain bikes.|`|LiOOF1Plaa	There is no way a mountain bike will reach the level of performance of a road bike. I ride a 18-pound mountain cross-country(XC) race bike.....and it still doesn't come close to a road bike's top speed. Mind you, I can easily maintain 25mph on pavement in my XC bike....but on my road bike, that speed jumps way up, to close to 33mph. Why is this? Rolling resistance is the huge factor, here. My XC race bike has a knobby tire tread footprint of 0.50" on pavement....while the road bike has only a slick, 0.20" tread impression.....almost like riding on one, thin rail!!! Also, the lighter weight of a road bike(average between 15-22lbs) makes pedaling a breeze. However, my $4000, 18 pound mountain XC race bike is among the lightest 2% of all mountain bikes(average between 25-33lbs)....it still cannot compete with a road bike.     I ride my XC race bike on-road, and off-road. This is where a road bike becomes completely useless.....off-road. Train fast on a mountain bike on road...and FLY on the road bike.|`|c2b4f2c9fe643129d284d8728194ae6aaa	train on what you will be racing    you can always carry extra weight if that makes any sense    or ride a cheaper heavier road bike for training    people do this anyway  their real race bike may be too delicate and light to take out every day    or - some people have 'race' wheels and 'training'  wheels      wle|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Your theory is good, but in reality they are are quite different.  I can tell a big difference in the muscles that I use when ridding my mountain bike and the ones I use when ridding my road bike.  On my mountain bike I can feel my quads working more while on my road bike I feel it more in my hamstrings and glut's. Training on a mountain bike wont hurt but it's not going to use those muscles you need when you are down in the drops.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	ok this is just my opinion. i use my old splz'd hardrock pro 48-36-24-crankset use same cadance on both bikes. same angles as my roadbike. i've adjusted it so they are both almost perfect match setups. the hdlbar slightly higher. it's 30lbs i use it for springtraining,  climbing & intervals. commute withit. i can ride it 30+ mph. use18lb road bike for longer weekend rides. sprint & tt.   if your bikes are setup close to same you'll still use most all the same muscles. i don't do any raceing anymore but still crack 40+ mph.   absorb others advise, think, try , use what works best for you.|`|XUUDRM7yaa	To a point, you're right.  However, the geometry of mountain bike frames and the components that they are usually equipped with will prevent you from going as fast as you can on a road bike.  You can outfit them with smaller slick tires and change the gearing, but the frame geometry prevents you from getting the same feel and performance.  That isn't to say that you can't enjoy the ride still, or retrofit a mountain bike frame into something much more road worthy.....it's just different and always will be.   If you like riding both, then at some point you're definitely going to own at least two bikes.  lol.   If it were me and I had to choose, I'd set up the mountain bike with an extra pair of light wheels with skinny tires and do it that way.  But my heart is in riding dirt and jumps, etc.  If road biking is what you enjoy more, then by all means invest in a road bike....you'll enjoy it!    As far as racing, if you were to train on a mountain bike and then race on a road bike, you might not be as competitive as you would think.  Unless you were able (and most of the time you can't do this really) to set up the mountain bike just like a road bike in regards to cockpit positioning, etc.....then when you get on the road bike your muscles aren't going to be quite as efficient or used to the new positioning.  Too many differences.   BUT, if you're more fit than the next guy, there's no reason you can leave him off the back and cross the line ahead of him.   :o)|`|L9I3z0fLaa	A MTB has greater rolling resistance and the aerodynamics are not as good as a road bike, so at the same effort level you will be going slower on the MTB.  If you workout harder on the MTB to go the same speed as on a road bike, presumably you'll be in better shape and be able to go faster on the road bike.  But that's assuming the person on the road bike is lazy and not training as hard as possible.    So in reality, the idea of training "harder" on a MTB is false.  Essentially, athletes in both disciplines do the same amount of work--they just go faster on road bikes because of lower resistance.  And many MTB racers spend a lot of their training time on road bike because they can control the type of training they do more easily than riding off road all the time.      Further, when MTB racing saw a decline a few years ago, some pro MTB racers started racing road bikes.  Guys like Cadel Evans have done very well, but in general you didn't see the top MTB guys suddenly become the best road racers.  The sports have different tactics, favor different types of riders, and draw different people to the respective disciplines.    At the end of the day, training quality depends on the right combination of time and intensity. Whether it's on a road bike or MTB will only affect the speed on that bike; fitness will be determined by how hard (and smart) you train overall.|`|8e35cfeded3c3b900607388410347b4caa	I do most of my triathlon training on my MTB.  HOWEVER, I put aerobars on it, and set it up so torso vs. leg angle would be similar to my tri-bike to get the same muscle recruitment.    Its not that I don't like my tri-bike, I just live very near a rails-to-trails system that lets me do 100+mile rides without exposing myself to the hazards of roads and motor vehicles for more than a mile or two.   I'd just as soon concentrate on my ride and not put up with cellphone yapping housewives careening around in their SUV's.    Yes, when I swap to the Cannondale for a race, it feels like a rocket ship.  I don't know that its an advantage, but I sure don't lose anything.    The real advantage is cost.  I'm wearing out cheap ($10) MTB tires on the training miles.|`|KJHt4hiYaa	They're like chalk and cheese. My roadbike is lightweight and has ultra thin tyres. It's responsive and accelerates with a few turns of the pedals and also maintains momentum whereas my mountain bike with its thick chunky tyres requires a bit of legwork. My mountain bike definitely gives my leg muscles a better workout but for aerobic fitness and cardio vascular improvement my road bike is superior because I'm maintaining a constantly high tempo. When you talk about getting fitter you have to remember there are two types of fitness- anaerobic and aerobic and on a road bike you only improve aerobic fitness whereas a mountain bike can give you more of an anaerobic workout.

khU8m4gxaa	Most everything about TNA is lame. Why was it an empty arena match anyway? If they didn't want interference, then just ban interference. The match itself wasn't bad, but it didn't stand up to the Foley vs. The Rock empty arena match or the Lawler vs, Funk empty arena match. Angle begging Sting off was good though. "C'mon, Sting! I got kids!" And Nash's "Make it right!". That was fun. Why did security come to break it up though? Makes no sense. Angle may as well have won since it wasn't a title match. Or was it?|`|fmUGHvgHaa	iOoops i idont iwatch itna .<br>  <br>  iWQ: iMY iGuess is iSting..|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	An empty arena should have been just that: empty... and yet Kevin Nash, Scott Steiner, and security intervened (to their credit, security didn't step in until after Angle spit in Sting's face, which was after Nash and Steiner had already stopped the fighting once before).<br>  <br>  WQ: Considering Sting was in the middle of swinging a steel chair at Angle's skull when Nash stopped him, I'm 99% certain that Sting would have won (and possibly knocked Angle out of TNA in the process).|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	What was the point of this?

khU8m4gxaa	You have to. He's not much of a technical wrestler, to say the least, but no one had the charisma of Hogan. Vince had the vision to take the business to another level, but there was no other superstar in the WWF at the time that could've carried the company like Hogan.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Of course. He's still to this day a name. You have to give some credit to a man whos been on top for 25 years now (and even longer if you consider his pre-WWF run in the AWA).|`|NRs72Afxaa	Bringing Wrestling Mainstream? Yes<br>  <br>  What he has done in his career? No, because when the fame went to his head people lost all respect to him. 2008 proved my point.|`|2b69d3273c89d3075ffe70337e541813aa	No the credit belongs to Vince McMahon|`|xaSEuGBGaa	<------------ yes lol|`|TIIBmO2gaa	I give him a ton of credit. So does the majority of the wrestling world. He and Vince McMahon created the marketing explosion in 80's. Without Hulk Hogan wrestlers would not be able to "sell" themselves like they do today. Hogan was the first superstar to break alot of barriers such as movie roles, high-profile magazine covers, lucrative promotions and contracts, merchandising, etc. It all started with him. And people can bash him all they want, but his impact on sports entertainment cannot be emphasized enough. I don't know how many times I've seen a wrestler (John Cena for example) come onto the scene, get put over big, then proceed to sell merchandise with ease, play a few movie roles, and become a cash register for the WWE. And who does John Cena thank for this? That's right, Hulk Hogan.|`|9f74caaf5c144aedc435309558b06d0eaa	I definitely give him credit. He's the most popular wrestler in WWF/WWF history. He's well known in pop culture. His defining moment was bodyslamming Andre the Giant. However, he was the most overrated wrestler ever. He hardly knew any moves. He could out muscle most opponents but he couldn't do basic wrestling moves. He also hung around for too long. In his last few years he was just doing a punch, boot, leg drop, and pin. I'll always remember Hulkamania but it's only fair to say that he was overhyped.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Yeah but that's about it.<br>   <br>  He's kind of ruined any other credit he might have gotten from most fans by being the backstage politician that most long time fans know he is. Anytime he appears on a WWE show you know he's only there for the payoff, and you also know that he's waved his creative control card and will get the win.<br>  <br>  When he went to WCW he kind of lost it. I think that wasn't all his fault though. It was because he'd always been seen as a WWE product (and basically was) To see him on the opposition was a kick in the teeth to longtime Hulkamaniacs.<br>  <br>  He hasn't done much to better people's opinions of him outside the ring either.|`|zVtkYkuaaa	hell yeah vince coulnt do it by himself hogan made wwe appearing on talk shows being so charasmatic making wrestling fun to watch|`|5JQFCQCkaa	Yeah, but alternatively, if it wasn't for him, the current and Attitude Eras wouldn't have been filled with, as us Australians call, wankers.|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	Of course, my friend who brought wrestling from a regional concept to a worldwide event.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|GJ9z6K1Baa	thats about all the credit he gets from me<br>  <br>  <br>  then again..vince brought wrestling to mainstream|`|kJhZx5Mcaa	NO NO NO|`|EFhaEtL7aa	Hell ya!!!!

BJ lost fair and square|`|gERaZGZeaa	GSP's victory is complete.  The trainer might have put some vaseline on GSP's back - which was then WIPED OFF - but I don't see how that changed the fact that GSP scored jabs to the nose and takedowns at will.  A complete domination like that is simply due to one fact - GSP outclassed and outfought BJ Penn in every way.|`|9ooXBxbJaa	BJ is a sore loser and talks crap always.  i would love to see him lose again so i say bring it on!

GSP needs to fire his corner.  They are professionals and should know the rules. Penn should stay away from GSP and not ask for a rematch.  He won't win....grease or no grease.|`|Qn6ERwZcaa	The only hits that Bj can land on GSP are ones coming from his filthy trash-talking mouth...he knows he doesn't have the skill to beat GSP, so he's gotta resort to slander|`|FpJ2qvrCaa	wow im gonna say the only way GSP's victory is tainted is by BJ takiong vacation 2 weeks before the fight or maybe we should blame taco bell and twinkies for his fat @$$ losing so bad, he was gassed after the 1st round what a joke this guy is.

bOAJBQP3aa	Ya i agree bret hart is good|`|dcNT65mTaa	HBK is the Showstopper and he was the 1st to do a ladder match. The commercial touched on a bunch of things but I didn't think it disrespected Bret Hart seeing how they said they had a hell of a match just for the sake of having one. It was talking about Wrestlemania and how it's the biggest stage in wrestling.|`|pmjOiQFvaa	i agree with braden above but its not disrespectful to be fair and that wrestlmania 10 match stole the show and indeed it did overshadown the harts match|`|m9Hmb93Uaa	The way it is now and probably forever is wwe vs bret hart|`|u2H68wiaaa	It's the truth.  The Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon ladder match was by far the best match of Wrestlemania 10 and one the most memorable matches of all time, bar none.  Anyone who says that the ladder match did not overshadow the Hart vs. Hart match from Wrestlemania 10 is ignorant.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	HBK's ladder match did steal the show, that's how it happened there is no getting away from it the ladder match stole the show it was a 5 star match! it would have stolen any show they just told it how it really was there was no negative spin on Wrestlemania 10 as far as i saw. Bret should be able to admit a 5 star match was better than his on the same card, it's called being a professional.|`|3icTrKLLaa	They did it because in WWE "history" the Michaels ladder match is more remembered. To most fans at the time the ladder match was THE BEST match of the ppv. I can see it as a little disrespectful, seeing as the Bret vs Owen match was amazing, but more fans remember the ladder match.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	I didn't, because everyone already knows how great Bret is. He's no longer with WWE, while Shawn still is and one of their main stars, so naturally they will show Shawn, whos a current WWE talent, over Bret

After a bit of a rest though, i'm sure he will be in good a form as ever.|`|T13xM9iJaa	Well for one come on he not a young as he use to be and yes we a  ALL know that Cody and Ted are going to have some part in that match but if you look at it they are giving Randy a really BIG push and make out to be a bigger heel then he already is so yeah I mean some underhanded stuff is gonna happened but it is all in the storyline you never know Shaine might just help out Taker just making the tension greater going into their match at No Way Out|`|Rq2BZ2Zeaa	Maybe cause he is aging?|`|dcNT65mTaa	Taker's getting old and we all know that as athletes, the older u get, the longer the recovery. They try to limit him to big matches and really his entrance is longer than most of the matches he fights on SD. He's a seat filler and always brings fans and cash so they wanna keep him from getting injured with too many of what they see as unnecessary matches.|`|Z1ruPjmCaa	i think his proformace is good hes just not in enough matches 2 make his contract worth while|`|RTuG9svRaa	he got old...he may have some kind  of an injury..you never know.. i don't think that taker would stand this if there wasn't any serious reason|`|J2bLQcHNaa	D:

They were robbed no question. They may not have been robbed of a title but they were robbed out of the chance. They had a very good chance of winning that series with it tied at 3 a piece, and I remember watching that series just screaming at the TV at blatantly wrong calls. That series was fixed, I don't care if David Stern denies it.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Even if that is true, your team still has to get the job done!<br>  It's not like the refs just give you 100 extra points. No, you have to make the shots, especially when it counts. And the Kings never did that, T-Mac certainly has never done that.<br>  <br>  Stop making excuses dude.|`|fAMpj8s2aa	good point. once again espn comes through with great factual information. i honestly feel bad for them. those years the champions should be given an asterisk.|`|uFctHPExaa	lol
U0Z3LRe1aa	I agree with the "nothing's legal in CA" statement, thats why I fled that rotten state...    Before blasting away, make sure its legal to shoot the firearm in the location you plan to go. I would look up the DEPT of FISH & GAME and find if any permit is needed-you see, CA has a budget problem--too many people eating up all the resources! CA will charge you for EVERYTHING, including a varmin permit for the year.     The fines and penalties are heafty, better be safe than sorry!|`|QC2NozBkaa	The only time you can legally kill crows in California is when the birds are ruining crops or livestock.  You must be the owner, tenant or  have written permission from the owner of the land.|`|0f58b7ae62db5c245105e10b9c061d03aa	Yes, as long as you have a hunting license.|`|9UUEhAYtaa	nothing is legal in california.
TPZwmQK9aa	The number 1 thing you have to do is scout, right up until season starts, as doves will be on one field one day, and another the next.  I hunt a lease with over 40 fields of various crops scattered over a 100+ sq/mi area, and you can bet that come opening day, the birds are really only using 1 or 2 of them heavily.  If you pull up to a field at daylight, and don't see more than a few dozen birds using a field, move on to another spot.    On top of that, using the most open choke you can find is essential.  I more than doubled my percentage of hits when I switched from a 12 gauge modified to a 20 gauge with a skeet choke.|`|5BEyeVy7aa	doves will do the same thing almost every day.  Leave roost to eat, drink water, go back to roost.  We hunt the water sources normally.  Find water that has little to no growth around the edge.  If you can find a dried up cattle pond or a mud bank on a river, they will probably come out there at some time during the day.  We hunt the food early and hunt the water late.  I shoot a 12g with  7 1/2 s.  But a 20g is just as good for dove.  I prefer a lighter faster load over a slower larger load of shot.  Buy cheap, you'll hopefully shoot a lot.|`|vea6mqPZaa	get out to your spot before shooting time starts  have enough shells for your limit and your ability  hunt an area where they are known by you to fly    I use an Ithaca 37 featherlight shooting 2 3/4 7.5 shot
0f58b7ae62db5c245105e10b9c061d03aa	What kind of birds? Pheasants, quail and such will be buried in the thickest weeds and cattails trying to stay warm. Ducks and geese fly more because they get cold sitting on the water. Turkeys don't seem to care one way or the other, but the wind and rain make it possible for you to get away with a little more movement and noise. As with any game animal, you need to understand why they do what they do when they do it if you are going to try to predict how they will react to certain things (like weather).|`|kQSSz2X2aa	Don't sit down wind of the game. They will smell you long before you ever see them. Use the wind to blow your scent away from the animal.|`|AA11694178	The rule of thumb is that if it is windy and rainy, pour another cup of coffee and kick back because the hunting that day is gong to suck and you will spend the day wet and cold as a bonus.  Windy days means bad hunting for all game and rain screws up bird hunting with or without the wind.|`|5BEyeVy7aa	we need more info.  what kind of game birds?|`|9wfmpBMWaa	I agree more info is needed.  If you are hunting grouse they will be in the trees.  Pheasants trend to hunker down in the rain and snow and may hold tighter.  If you have a dog rain makes it hard for your dog to pick up sent. Ducks and geese are more likely to be flying low in bad weather I have had some of my best duck hunts in blinding snow.

TDBnUpvUaa	Last year a college women's softball team conceded a game (and I think a championship might have been on the line).  The opponent batter hit what would have been a game-winning home run, but while rounding first base, she landed wrong and blew out her ACL.  Her teammates could not help her around the bases because that would be an automatic out.  So the fielders carried her around the bases so that her run would count.|`|WiIUEObTaa	have three. british columbia walking off the field when thier coach protested a indo-canadian girl, ten years old was bieng protested for her religious headgear. the young ladies were softball. players aged 10 years to 12 years. no adults told them to walk. these young ladies took it upom themselves. to do the right thing. it did reach provincial goverment. the whole province was outraged. at this age no adult interfernce. may not be the greatest. but the classiest. higher profile sports. gordie howe not smashing a puck through gumps face. nicklaus coceding 3 foot putt. may leave sour taste. sammy running in to celebrate when mark broke his record. mark did not break maris 61 sammy was the first. with the roids. tainted. john carlos raised fist 1968 olympics. the love shown to annika by l p g as final round. still the young ladies walking title game to make statement. works for me. sport statement yes. political statement great. the emotion and respect shown to ali. greatest athlete humanitarian of all time. nelson mandella turned down visit with the pope requested on his own to talk to the greatest. there may be hope yet.|`|nabKFpNRaa	probably when the kids mom died and he couldnt get in the game and then the other team got a free throw if he did get in and the other team missed purposely to not give anything against him

If it is plastic,you can guarantee it will break much quicker than a metal one.  However, KWA has multiple types of pistols, 1911, glocks, M9,etc...  They have a semi/full auto glock, the KWA G26c.  It is a great gun.  If you don't mind not having full auto, i would personally recommend the KWA M1911.  It has a metal frame and slide, and is a great gun.  The price is roughtly the same, about $150.  Airsoft Extreme is a great store with great customer service, and have stores in Northern and Southern California.  Here is the link for the G26c and 1911:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.airsoftextreme.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=366_75&products_id=3416" rel="nofollow">http://www.airsoftextreme.com/store/inde...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.airsoftextreme.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=366_75&products_id=1932" rel="nofollow">http://www.airsoftextreme.com/store/inde...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|5jxjiBTVaa	KWA and KWJ both make very authentic Glock Gas blowbacks.

DYFDlCUiaa	If pressed, I would say Boston. They are more balanced. You take 'Bron from the Cavs and Kobe from LA, both those teams have huge voids lost offensively. Boston would still lose a good bit with KG, but they have a good defense, a good PG in Rondo, and two capable scorers in Pierce and Allen. That and their bench isn't shabby either, as it showed in the Finals.|`|58003342aa441872ce7e879f37b6c7c4aa	Boston would be the best...they still have 2 super stars..same with the spurs and the lakers might be alright...cleveland would fall the farthest|`|j0YJX8U6aa	Lakers<br>  <br>  they have a great bench and even with kobe out take a look at the line-up<br>  <br>  Gasol<br>  Odom<br>  Walton<br>  Ariza or Sasha<br>  Fisher|`|dmg6OjjZaa	warriors. they would still have stephen jackson, jamal crawford, andris biedrins, and corey maggette. jackson and crawford are their best players btw|`|ISQAWUf2aa	Lakers would be fine look what kobe did 30 points nine assits last night.<br>  <br>  <br>  lakers will be fine without kobe and kobe is doing that right now.

1rTm4p75aa	Look to tackle an opposing player from behind or from the side (grabbing his legs below the knees). You have less chance of being injured, or injuring your opponent this way.    You'd be surprised how a good technique can bring even the toughest of opponents to the ground. You should find your confidence grows and that you'll then be prepared to challenge a player from the front (i.e. charging directly at you). Lunge shoulder-first in these situations and you'll minimise potential impact.    Shoulders and knees are at risk of injury when tackling - I twisted my knee and haven't played since (all due to poor judgement when committing to a tackle). You might wish to buy some protection to support these more - You can wear torso-support underneath your shirt and many professionals choose to do this.|`|Efns7sDLaa	I suffer from the same thing. The way I get over it is not to think about it. If you think about it too much, you thinks of things that could go wrong. But if you get your head down run at a 28st sweaty prop, wrap him up and tackle him properly, nothing bad can happen. I've been playing rugby for 5 years and the worst thing I've seen is a concussion. At training we mostly do tackle bags before moving on to people. Its not something to worry about. trust me|`|uEjh3CAbaa	Just get in there or don't play rugby!|`|ampkZtrXaa	Don't think aboutit, just enjoy the game.|`|L8uGrIpmaa	Keep doing it until it becomes routine|`|mY1pvs27aa	Get yourself pumped up and psyched up. Once your fully pumped and you have a good tackling technique and your adrenaline is pumping, you won't feel anything during the game, until a bit of aching after you've showered. be confident. the harder you go in the more prepared your boy is, the less it will hurt. if you hesitate, your body is hesitant and you get hurt.|`|OFSby06faa	I've had this problem all my playing career and I've been playing for 23 years!      Fear is always a factor in contact sport.  Don't ever think that it's weak to be afraid on the rugby field.  It's normal but you've got to be very deliberate in creating steps to overcome that fear.    Strength comes in knowing that fear and overcoming it.    Personally I try to be as technical as possible when and use self talk when making tackles.  Have cues in your head, I have four words that I think of during every tackle.  They are "hips, head, hold and hustle."  Hips is my target area and where I get my body/shoulders close into.  Head is making sure my head is in the right place, cheek to cheek.  Hold is making sure I wrap them up tight.  Hustle is to make sure I get back on my feet and go for the ball after a tackle.    Also I find that audibly calling out and pointing to the man that you're marking really helps.  If you've taken ownership of making that tackle to yourself and your team mates then you're more likely to make the tackle.    Hope that helps.

You may not legally sell, give, loan, etc. any high capacity magazine unless the recipient is a dealer with a high capacity magazine license or qualifying law enforcement official.  Sacramento has some of the most restrictive gun laws in California.  Sacramento has their own "acceptable gun" list, has created "gun free zones", etc.  Yuba and Sutter counties are much more firearm friendly. <br>  <br>  Concerning a concealed weapon permit (CCL), I have included a link to the Sacramento County Sheriff's office you will want to look at.  Like I said, not a gun friendly county. I have also included links to Sutter, Yuba and Placer counties for comparison.  Whatever county you relocate to the first place to start is the Sheriff's Office--they are usually the ones who are responsible to issue permits (there is a provision for chief's of police to issue permits to people residing within their jurisdictions). No matter what county (or city) issues it, your permit is good state wide.<br>  <br>  The camping question is complicated.  Your location will determine the right answer.  Without a Concealed Carry License you are subject to a rats nest of state and local restrictions.  The best thing you can do is check with the regulatory agency controlling the area where you plan to camp.|`|h6y25GSBaa	i live up in northern California and asked the same question to the DOJ (department of justice) they told me that California law prohibits all magazines that can carry over 10 rounds for any fire arm unless you have lived in California long enough to have had the magazine from before the 1994 assault rifles ban which covers extensively the ownership of any magazine that carries over 10 rounds. <br>  so in conclusion no you cant have a magazine that carries more than 10 rounds in California unless you purchased it before the 1994 ban in California and have been a resident here ever since.<br>  READ HERE unlike what was said above you may have a threaded barrel on a .22lr rifle for the attachment of a boss system or compensator. i asked the DOJ who gave me the run around but eventualy told me what was what.|`|fUDlbOP0aa	in California without a very special (and rare) permit you may not have any firearm that can hold 10 or more rounds in any kind of magazine, except a tube magazine. So detachable, fixed, limit is 10 rounds. additional laws:<br>  California is a AW ban state. Unlike the rest of the nation for us the assault weapon ban started in 1994 and got more restricted in 2000. It never ended. So you may not bring any kind of semiautomatic rifle with more than one of the following: a pistol grip, a detachable magazine, a bayonet lug. You may not have any the following on a rifle: any kind of muzzle attachment that can be used as a grenade launcher, a flash suppressor, threads on barrel muzzle, a forward grip.<br>  There his a huge list of guns banned regardless of the assault weapon banned items. A court ruling stated that California may not ban all firearms by name, it must do so by model. So before ALL AK47 and AR15 type rifles were banned. Now the vast majority of them are still banned, with a handful that is legal. Any "assault rifle" must be over 30" overall and 16" barrel minimum length. <br>  Shotguns follow slightly different rules, especially the semiautomatic ones. the limit I believe is 10 rounds, even if its a tube magazine. Semiautomatic shotguns may not have a removable magazine, a pistol grip. Semi's magazine capacity I believe is a 3 round limit. All AW ban rules apply. <br>  Pistols are harder, all pistols must have a magazine within the grip, all pistols must be DOJ approved with some exceptions, magazine limit of 10 rounds, no forward grips, federal rules apply, no muzzle threads. <br>  <br>  NFA weapons (if you have one or more)<br>  Some AOWs are legal. more are not. <br>  MG's, DD's, Suppressors, SBR and SBS weapons are all banned. Exceptions only apply to law enforcement with very special permits. <br>  <br>  you can review everything California gun control here:<br>  <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/firearms/" rel="nofollow">http://ag.ca.gov/firearms/</a><br>  (its the state website, you can even email them if you have questions)
4L8h8Rp9aa	Dre' Bly is from Virginia, so I would look for him to try to go east to be closer to home. The Ravens might be an option since they cut Chris McAlister. The Redskins would be an option only if they cannot resign DeAngelo Hall to a long term deal. The Falcons may be an option, depending on how much money Bly is looking for.|`|tPaRZod9aa	I think he'll go back to detroit. They released bodden, so they deffinately need a number one guy.

ZDOUwJsbaa	I just bought my son a savage 111 in .270 for christmas. I bought it at Dick's sporting goods. It was a package deal with a 3-9x40mm scope. Can't remember for sure but I think I paid 300 plus tax. The rifle is great! It shoots great cycles quite smoothly for a lower priced firearm and we have had no problems with it at all. For the money I cant imagine a better gun. Plus I am also a huge fan of the .270. Have hunted with one for years and haven't found any game animal in north america that it hasn't brought down with one well placed shot. If your finances don't allow the purchase of a higher priced gun then this, in my opinion is a no brainer. Get the savage you wont be disappointed.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Savage are decent enough guns.  Nothing too fancy, and not too many features.  People like them simply based on the cost factor.  They are well known for their accuracy as well.  There are a lot of nicer guns, just not for the same price as a Savage.  I have shot several Savages, but I have never owned one of their bolt guns (I have a Savage 99 in 300 savage that was my grandfathers).  I would not feel at all disadvantaged hunting with one, but I have always saved the extra few bucks to get a fancier model.  I like CZ's and Brownings best.  I own a few Winchesters, Remingtons, and more than a few Rugers as well.  Any decent gun store will either have one, or can order one.  As for price, go to gunbroker.com and search it.  That will give you a real good idea what they are selling for.  I'd do it for you, but I'm feeling a little lazy tonight.|`|aoSS4mu9aa	Savage guns are excellent for the value. I own three Savages myself and have never been disappointed in their cost, craftsmanship and accuracy.|`|dAK8dS4kaa	I got my Savage .308 (can't think of the model right now) and for ab out $250, never looked back either. It's accurate, light weight, and durable. Not once have I had a problem with it.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Excellent choice, or get a Remington.*

1uSoU8Lpaa	I agree, the National anthem is not a time to display your karaoke skills. I hate the added notes, ignored notes the "oooOOhhHoo's" "eeEEeeoEE (yes I'm free) eeEEEee"  Please don't use this time to show off, it's not cool. If the song is 2 minutes, it shouldn't take 5.

I did a web search for browning rifles + BAR, I think I'd call Browning before going through the hundreds of returns from the web. Best of luck.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	The people at Browning are excellent for customer service and will probably give you some info over the phone, though they may want some concrete evidence that you actually have the gun (Polaroid) before giving you specifics as to where and when the gun was made, etc.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	If I didn't already have a Garand, I would want your rifle.
AUHsZvavaa	Griffey will most likely win the BA battle, but Howard will probably crank out 50 or so HRs.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Its Howard for Homers I expect high 30s for him<br>  But average ill give griffey cuz howard does strike out a lot|`|fQIxah8laa	Ryan Howard, cause he's younger. Jr's past his prime in my opinion.|`|G4wGCghdaa	Sometimes I type LOL while I really didn't laugh out loud. This time I really did LOL. Lets see where can I start with this answer? <br>  1- What makes you think a career .288 hitter will hit .400+ at age 39?<br>  2- His last 4 seasons almost 2000 at bats he has averaged a HR every <br>      17.61 at bats. So to hit 30 home runs he would need 528 at bats <br>       and 616 at bats to hit 35 homers. His 20 yr average is 468 at bats <br>       per season.<br>  3- His best season for batting average in the last 11 years was in 2005<br>        when he hit .301 ( getting 148 hits in 491 at bats ) Even in that year<br>       he would have needed 81 more STRAIGHT HITS to bat .400 ( 229 <br>       hits in 572 at bats ).<br>  4- He averaged only 1 home run every 24.88 at bats his first 4 seasons<br>      Then he OVERNIGHT became a HOME RUN machine for the next <br>      8 straight years. Hitting on every 11.93 at bats. Kind of suspicious <br>      that Griffey JUST LIKE Bonds, McGwire, Sosa, Palmeiro and<br>      A-Rod just happened to have his power stats go up 100% at the <br>      height of the steroid 90's.<br>  <br>  If you expect no more than 400 at bats 15 Home Runs and a .245 average you might not be disappointed. If you expect 30-35 HR and a .400 + Average then you will be very disappointed.<br>  <br>  He must also just DH and not play the outfield as he is terribly slow and has no arm these days.<br>  <br>  Edit: forgot to answer, Griffey higher avg. Howard more HR.|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	Howard will have more home runs in 2009.  He might even lead the league (again).<br>  <br>  I would be very surprised (at either the vast improvement in Howard or substantial decline in Griffey) if Griffey does not end up with the better 2009 batting average.|`|mml9J88caa	hey another mariners fan. im not alone anymore lol<br>  and this just depends on if jr. gets hurt or not.<br>  If he can play dh and stay healthy then i am going to guess jr. first sign of him not performing as he can im giving it to Ryan Howard|`|rzc1oLktaa	Ryan Howard Hands Down.|`|GtoKpO23aa	im gonna say griffey on both acounts cause he's the kid and im a mariners fan if only edgar would come out of retirement then it would be the greatest moment in my life if griffey hadnt gone to the reds then we would be talking about the new home run king. its so strange that when jr was in his prime people talked about him as the greatest of his generation and now that he got injured and slowed down after teh 90's they talked about bonds being the greatest of that time. Griffey is and always should be considered teh greatest baseball player of the 90's|`|sitkfn5Maa	i think it depends if Jr stays healthy. wait till the middle of the season and then place your bets. but my opinion now it will be close, both will hit more then 30 and average wise .320's for Howard and maybe give or take at least .400 for Jr. still depends if he's healthy.
jd14u32qaa	No.  The playoffs should have the best of the best.  Over half the teams in the NBA, OVER HALF, make it.  That's way too many.  Even the NFL has too many.  I think baseball has it right.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	No.<br>  <br>  Comments:<br>  <br>  1. Who cares what the lesser sports do? The NBA has an overdrawn, interminable, uninteresting tournament, in which the first two rounds are essentially meaningless, and which television dictates the schedule (for the NBA, anyway; the NHL should be so lucky). Sorry, but citing the NBA postseason simply works as a counterexample and in support of MLB NOT doing similar.<br>  <br>  2. It's hard to vest any credulity into someone who cannot correctly spell a three letter acronym.|`|jKOB7n35aa	It is fine with only 8, and used to only be 4. That way only the best have a shot. The NFL is flawed (Cardinals get in Super Bowl and Patriots don't even make the playoffs) and the lower seeds in the NBA playoffs never compete anyway. MLB and the NHL have it right since every team in the playoffs has a good shot.|`|V430UrvFaa	It's MLB not MBL and the only way they add more playoff teams and rounds is by taking away the amount of regular season games played, maybe from 162 to 154.|`|AA10251268	I think that argument just shows that the other sports have too many teams in the playoffs.  If you make the playoffs for merely having a slightly above-average record, it kind of defeats the purpose of having a lengthy regular season.  It make a bit of sense in the NFL, where the small number of games is really insufficient at separating the teams; in MLB, the 162 game schedule does that.|`|gMTatFZBaa	Yeah, let's water it down some more. They still haven't recovered pitching wise from the last two expansions, some teams can barely keep it together as it is and you want to add more teams to the playoffs so more non-deserving teams get in.<br>  <br>  Why not just have a ten game season and a 152 playoff games?<br>  <br>  This is why the general public doesn't get to make these decisions.|`|bXY6d6o5aa	They've changed the playoff system plenty of times. There is no reason to believe that they will do this. Especially in this time where the playoffs are the last thing on their mind. They should fix  the steroids situation before doing anything else.|`|VeJ1niiMaa	No I feel the MLB playoffs is setup perfectly. I also feel the NBA playoffs is too long.|`|9C6KvSAkaa	No, the post season drags on enough as it is. This coming year it could possibly go into November...|`|0zCHdo13aa	first its mlb not mbl second it would be a playoff it would be a regular seson games|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	No they should not.  It is bad enough the way it is.|`|fQIxah8laa	By the way it's MLB. And no, they should leave it as is.|`|P93I8CHtaa	if they do that,they have to shorten the regular season
6qe9jeGOaa	@Mamba: thats only because the lakers shot way more free throws<br>  edit:I hate the spurs i never said they was my team.back to the subject,the lakers had way more free throws which is the easiest shot in the game.it gets no easier than that lol|`|H8u7gMAYaa	That all depends on how you look at the situation. Either way, they still had to score more points than the other team. And they did.<br>  <br>  NO EXCUSES!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Rez, doesn't matter. THEY STILL HAD TO MAKE THEIR FREE THROWS. man, you guys are soo stuck on this thing like the world is over or something. GET OVER IT. we won. You don't see us talking smack about your Spurs or anything. I give them credit when they win games, you should do the same to us!<br>  <br>  Edit: what!? I didn't block you bro..I swear.<br>  <br>  Edit: Don't even get me started on Bonds. People hate him because he took roids, which he shouldn't of done. But, do you know how hard it is to hit a 95mph ball? especially with Bonds, when 75% of the time the pitchers would just walk him. And he still managed to get tons of home runs. Steroids don't make you a better baseball hitter, it just makes you stronger is all. Bonds is the home run king until someone dethrones him.|`|JsVZQkWyaa	well we cant do anything about it. it happened in the past and nothing will change it. but i think the kings got robbed. it was like the team i played for got robbed yesterday.|`|ExVTrokAaa	You need to Build yourself a bridge<br>  AND GET OVER IT!!!|`|aVkoNhvPaa	what the hell that video sounded like I was watching some cult film were the world is coming to an end  or something<br>  <br>  I will admit there were some lopsided calls but you can't change history|`|zhi3oUr4aa	true*|`|aUGM3ju6aa	2002 NBA Championship = WWE|`|WLXFAeSnaa	False

cR7Sf4cjaa	I live in Alaska.  <br>  <br>  Everyone I know hunts for food.  I do not know anyone who does it for pleasure - and I know allot of hunters.  Trying to remove a moose from knee deep water, covered in flies and biting yellow jackets, takes me and my wife a good 11 hours of back breaking work.  Then there is the two full days of working 16 hours a day cutting, wrapping, and grinding.  Believe me - pleasure is not part of the equation.<br>  <br>  There are many people who own rifles and probably 'talk' a good hunt.  Or dream of actually shooting a big game animal and in some way think they might get pleasure from it - but these people are inexperienced and have never been a sucessful hunter in their life.  Or they are simply guys who do not feel 'manly' walking in the woods admiring nature unless they have a gun and appear to be doing a manly pastime!  These guys never shoot anything - but probably do get lots of pleasure just being outdoors in the woods and wilderness.<br>  <br>  Shooting is what you hear and read people concentrate on about hunting.  But real hunting is about finding the proper animal and getting all the meat out before it spoils - and days and days of butchering.  Whe the bullet flies true - the work begins.<br>  <br>  A sucessful hunter is only concerned with a clean one shot kill and that the animal does not feel any pain.  When you go into your freezer and pull out a steak or burger - you want to associate that food with a clean kill and a good day of hunting ......... not some suffering, screaming, half wounded animal that was in misery.<br>  <br>  Bottom line.  Pleasure is not part of hunting.  Anyone who gets pleasure from killing an animal or seeing one in pain is mentally ill and needs help.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|4SF4KGu4aa	Sounds like the beginning of an argument against hunting. I hunt and eat what I kill. Do I have to hunt for a meal? No. But when I hunt, I also don't HAVE TO buy meat loaded with preservatives and who knows what else. The meat I harvest from game has much less fat in it and is delicious.<br>  <br>  Since it is a legal activity AND hunters by far spend more money in support of wildlife, then I think more people should hunt.|`|RD05jXYwaa	a very pertinent question in today's economy. what ever the figure is now it will certifiably go up drastically over the next few years. that is sad isn't it? tmm|`|DHIudHy2aa	I am not sure about the statistics, but I can tell you there must be at least 100. I know here in Canada that if that is what you are doing then many restrictions are waived.|`|bpEv0B6Naa	About 95% of American hunters will eat what they kill or give it to others to eat, or even charity orginzations like hunters for the hungry.<br>  <br>  The other 5% I detest and are pure sport hunters hunting for the sole thing of killing the animal and taking its head or antlers only.<br>  <br>  However, I to hunt for "pleasure" as well. I love the challenge of hunting, its much harder than you think, it's not as easy as on the TV shows and it is alot of boring mornings sitting in the bitter cold. But it all pays off when you get the prize and get to put fresh venison on the table!|`|lT8MEI6Raa	Their ONLY source of food? I doubt there are any at all these days. Back in the 60's (I think it was the 60's anyway) there was an indian who walked out of the woods in California half starved to death. He was the last known indian of his kind, living only off the land for his whole life up until that time.  He had a bow and arrow that he had made the same way the indians did back in the day, and he taught people his archery skills after he was "discovered"|`|Td7ME2fUaa	Hm. I dont think there would ever be ANY kind of study like this. I dont see any real reason to do something like that. Maybe less than like 0.8% of the population. thats just my guestimation though. I'm a scholar...|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	It's illegal to waste the meat of most animals.  Anyone that does is a poacher.<br>  <br>  The only time it is legal to waste meat is when a herd is being culled to stop the spread of disease or shooting a few pest species.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	I don't think that records like that are taken. I hunt for the meat as it's cheaper plus Il;ike to bleach the bones and I know I will be called nuts for that. Just like I was called nut for buying ammo in bulk last year and look where we are now...
LUnscegvaa	upsetting your opponents balance whilst keeping your hips lower than his and then it should become easier.<br>  <br>  Best wishes :)***|`|tXTB8inJaa	first you have to use Kuzushi(breaking the balance) this varys from throw to throw, next time your coach shows you a throw, pay to how he/she is pulling and or pushing to see how to break the balance. then you want to drop your hips BELOW there's, if your center of gravity is above there's, its not gonna happen. and depending on the throw just finish.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Make sure you're getting good kazushi. You need to ask your sensei for help instead of constantly asking questions on Yahoo! Answers, because I assure you that no one on here can help your nage waza through a computer screen. If you don't have a Judo sensei, then that's probably the reason why your nage waza isn't working.|`|z1aOKtsyaa	Break their balance first by whatever method. When you step in for the throw, make sure you're hip is touching theirs, then sit low. Make sure your hip is out to whichever side it should be, but too far and they'll be on your back instead. Pop your hips up while rotating your shoulders, and voilà.

444cc0a50021891de69824c19550f54daa	I think that every person that practices martial art does it a.o. for these reasons|`|UHTcpdkVaa	I do it for exactly these reasons.  Though I take two - one for self-defense and the other for exercise.  There are other reasons of course - I find the self defense class to be very intellectually stimulating - but being able to burn off extra energy after work makes me a much happier person.|`|BOrFGNbOaa	It is but you have to be very selective of the place you learn it from. I learned the hard way that not all training centers are equal or very good for that matter. The first place I went to had a scattered, unfocused training program, a teacher that was always late, and the skills (when practiced in real life) were a joke. <br>  <br>  You also have to consider your self defense needs. For example, kick boxing may be good for a blunt K.O. punch and run but it won't help you in a situation where an attacker has you pinned on the ground or a weapon on you, this is where some of the more intense programs come in. You should also know that Tournament Styled Martial Arts are less likely to work in real world situations since those are more focused on a points systems rather than effectiveness.<br>  <br>  You should also know that jumping both feet into training with little to no physical fitness background will be extremely difficult during your first few days and may make you want to stop. So if you're seriously considering Martial Arts I strongly recommend you build up in that area just a bit so the transition will be much smoother.|`|nRBC4E5saa	It can be poor or great for both, depending on how it's trained.  In some classes you don't break a sweat, so that wouldn't be great for exercise, and in others you just kick and punch the air forever, and that wouldn't be good self-defense.

9NDL5YQJaa	Good answer by Jake Lo.    I'd just like to add that you can't think about having pads on your shins or not.  You just have to go with the flow b/c during the fight you won't be thinking about it.  Just make sure to check your opponents kicks and try not to get yours checked.|`|1e576939d9233965a515d8aaa9992a28aa	Ouch.      Well, it's too late to train shin kicks to bamboo trees, so best bet is to be strategic.  Don't try to answer with force on force.  Choke your opponent's attacks.      Good luck.|`|6wSmZrrsaa	Man whenever I'm preparing for a muay thai fight I usually kick a palm tree until it falls down to get my shins prepared|`|gBO908P6aa	Set up your low kicks using strategy, combinations and tactics.  This will save you a lot of pain and wasted movements.  Don't just go wailing away, unless your opponent is clueless and doesn't know how to defend low kicks.  Remember the entire body is a target, not just his legs.  Learn to fake low and aim high when his arm drops or vice versa.  A good boxer will attack every spot when the opportunity arises.  If a kick comes your way on the mid to high line, learn to smother it by catching it and punching back or using your gloves to catch the kick.  Think of your gloves as a pair of Thai pads.  Remember during pad training how you held the Thai pads and responded to your partner's attacks by catching his techniques.  Only difference now is you have gloves on.|`|Lgjlpocqaa	if your not prepared i wouldn't fight. and never drop your hands to block a kick, check the kick with your shin.|`|kH4LeoAAaa	Jake Lo got it.
SDdooOuzaa	Rent your gear, but buy your clothes.<br>  <br>  Its always good to have a cool snow outfit.  So spend your money on some nice pants and a jacket.  That way if you are terrible on the mountain, at least you look good!<br>  <br>  This way if you hate snowboarding you will have a snow outfit and if you end up loving snowboarding you can buy the board later.  Renting is only like $50|`|JThgHiaoaa	Should hire your gear the first time... you might find your not the best at it and would prefer skiing or not like the snow at all.<br>  <br>  Otherwise your choices are good but prolly a bit too long...

Your boots are the most importnant thing you need. You need to try them on and see which ones have the best fit and heal grip. There are so many other brands out there. Dont limit yourself. There is still Salomon, D.C., 32, K2, VANS, and whatboots I ahve liked a lot in the last few years... RIDE.TAke a lesson and rent the rest of your gear after that until you have tried some different stuff before you invest. Look at bindings that are easy to get in and out of....so it doesnt slow you down at the top or the bottom. And with clothes...spend a lot of money on super water=proof pants, Then you are dry and comfy. You can always change and buy new coats when they get wet or go out of style|`|NpVOBr00aa	If it's your first time boarding, i honestly wouldn't buy a brand new board. I would rent it, just because you never know if you're going to like it. First time is usually always the most frustrating. But if not then, i would definitely recommend burton, k2, etc. and if you're 5'2 then i would probably get under a 143. I'm 5'4 and a 143 goes up to my chin. Keep in mind that when you measure a snowboard, it should stand to from about your chin to your nose. And as for clothes, wear whatever you are comfortable in. It's not about what you look like when you board. It's about how you ride and if you're comfortable!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope that helps at all.|`|MFI0V2GBaa	a 154 is WAY to big for your size.

I wouldn't suggest buying them online without trying some on in a store, unless you really have no care.<br>  <br>  Pants and Jacket just get whatever you like for you're looks, same with goggles.|`|wvJmLgKxaa	i would go for the burton, i'm not sure m3 is that reputable of a company.<br>  You going to also buy EST bindings which will set you back another $100-$300. <br>  <br>  as for boots/goggles, it doesnt really matter that much, just get what feels the best.|`|jhOlrZnpaa	DEFINITELY RENT YOUR EQUIPMENT!!!! until you trust yourself to buy your board you should rent it. You are only going to scratch it up. You measure your boards by your chin, stand up straight and lean it against your front. It should stand right at your chin. <br>  take lessons they really help and don't be scared to fall. rent a helmet and wrist guards.

cWyjO8vBaa	i think you should do cheerleading. i am on an all star team and i also do orchestra and we do a lot of concerts for grades (because it is a class in school) and i have to do school things and homework. i am even in a high school level math class in middle school. and, i have no prablems. competitions are usually on the weekends (staurday and sunday), and school and orchestra/choir thihngs are on different days. you have a cuple practices a week (like two or three) and they are like two or three hours long, and there is still time to do homework or anything else you need to do.<br>  <br>  i hope this helped!!!|`|8X9IYJIMaa	You should do it. I started all-star in middle school and still made the honor roll every quarter. Its not tht much time consuming depending on your squad.

Ro03hVb6aa	Linebackers make lots of tackles, so blindside flanker is probably the closest, followed closely by open side who often makes hard tackles too.  These guys wear 6 and 7, respectively, on their backs.  Look at Rocky Elsom as a typical 6 and Richie McCaw as a 7 (Richie is anything but typical, the finest player of a generation).  <br>  <br>  Their job is to make lots of crunching tackles, however, there is no direct equal to linebackers as players in rugby are expected to be adept at both attack and defense so they each have other roles to consider too, it is anything but a stop start game.|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	To answer your question, you may need to explain what a linebacker does in gridiron.|`|PkpTlIbwaa	As previous poster said, there is not any specific position.  If you look at how linebackers stand, it looks very typical of how forwards position in rugby when they choose to hang off from a ruck or maul (either offensively when their team has possession, or defensively), and it could be almost any forward in a given situation.  In fact if play has broken down in midfield, it could be almost any back as well.<br>  <br>  There, that covers every base.  But in all honesty, because that kind of role in rugby tends to be in general play, not from set pieces such as scrums, it really is any player who chooses to hang off when others are tackled or committed already to the ruck or maul.<br>  <br>  Possibly you could say it is more often loose forwards such as flankers who perform that role, especially a blindside flanker protecting that side of a ruck.  But also very commonly props, especially if the ball is fairly well certain to be won by the opposition and they choose to detach and protect against runs off short passes close in to the ruck.
MwDRb7GLaa	A touring bike is my suggestion. I love mine because it is so versatile. They are built just beefy enough to handle rough roads while loaded down with gear. They are light enough to move right along.<br>  I've taken mine on the gravel covered paths of Acadia National park, along rough New England roads, over steep hills, and fended off glass on the side of the road while commuting.<br>  I highly recommend the Bianchi Volpe as a starting point. It is not a cheap bike, but you will likely want to keep it for awhile. Try out a few others for fit reasons, but use the Bianchi as a guide as to what works.<br>  I would also recommend a careful selection among tires. Panaracer Pasella or Continental Touring tires are the standard bearers here. Make sure it is built for touring and you'll be happy. They wear well and rarely puncture. Plus the extra volume makes them more comfortable with little compromise on speed.<br>  A great saddle is important on longer rides. I will stick with the Brooks B-17 for touring and general riding. Check out the link below if interested. The best part is that they break in to your body and improve with age.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	You live in teh city?  I do too. Most people around me look to me like they're on road bikes. Lots of bikes around me.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Yay!!! I just got a hybrid and so I guess I made the right choice!  Phew!|`|DOVbF4Piaa	A hybrid bike would be the best.  They are efficient on the road and at the same time can be ridden on bike paths ( even the gravel ones ).  They will also have bosses to allow the attachment of fenders and racks. Take a look at Trek, Giant, Fuji, Cannondale, Raleigh, Specialized, and a few others.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bicyclewarehouse.com/itemlist.cfm?pageId=353" rel="nofollow">http://bicyclewarehouse.com/itemlist.cfm...</a>|`|05cNPeRtaa	With the price range you mentioned, and keeping in mind that you will be riding on grass, a hybrid will probably the best bike for you.  Riding on bike paths could be okay on a road bike if the path is paved, if it is gravel, stay with the hybrid because otherwise gravel could fill up the brakes.  I do not own a hybrid but you can go to this link for a nice looking hybrid: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.touringcyclist.com/bikes/model_17444.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.touringcyclist.com/bikes/mode...</a>|`|aBBBDhR4aa	get a fixie here is a great deal on one <a href="http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/mercier/kilott.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/merc...</a>|`|7da25fkTaa	I personally like a mountain bike, it's great on the road but is even more fun on the bike trails.  It's also nice to know that you can jump a curb or take an off road trail instead of sticking to the road if you had a road bike.  <br>  <br>  As for the bike itself, stick with a hardtail, a rear shock will do you no good and also at that price range you'll get a very 'clunky' bike.  Stay away from any department store bikes, go to a bike shop, they'll fit you up with the right bike.  Myself i've got a Jamis Durango 1.0, which is a great bike that fits in your price range, and also a Trek 3700, which is at the lower end of bike shop bikes.  I personally would go with a company that doesn't have that 'brand name' on it because your paying for it (as i noticed with my trek)  For the same price, you can get a lesser name bike from a bike shop, and they usually have better components, frame, disc brakes etc.  The two that come to mind would be Jamis and KHS.  Trek, Giant, Norco etc are also great bikes but like I sais your paying a little for the name.<br>  <br>  Take a look at used bikes too (www.kijiji.com) bikes really drop in value, especially in winter!<br>  <br>  Good luck i hope this helped a little
UlXBL8tbaa	I think you'd need to at least play the game and possibly coach at some level!<br>  <br>   :)<br>   ;)|`|8QUF659maa	Ok. First things first. Salary not slary. Using proper English on an application will help. <br>  <br>  Second. Your chances are slim to none if you have never played. BUT that doesn't mean it is impossible. There are more than a few coaches who have never played a down in their lives. <br>  <br>  Most of them start as an assistant to the assistant Special teams coach for a high school team. Once they have proved themselves capable they move up in the ranks through H.S., Division II then Division I then finally the NFL.<br>  <br>  Or they give the team's owner a hummer.
vF5lU8zeaa	Okay, I will explain it in simple terms, then on a little more scientific level... thermals don't "fog up" on you like regular lenses do in extremities.<br>  <br>  Here is why, while a regular lens is a single pane, a thermal is a double pane with a vacuum in the middle. If you remember high school physics, the rules about things like heat, amongst other things, change in a vacuum. The temperature on one side of the lens has no bearing on the temperature on the other (which will be closer to your body temp due to breathing and the simple release of body heat). With a single lens the moisture on one side or the other (the problem is typically the inside) will condense on the lens because of the temperature change.|`|RuJYupFWaa	Thermal lens is designed to resist fogging.  There's 2 types of thermal lenses.<br>  <br>  Thermal Coating - a coating is baked on the lens.

It's just that when we get older, we don't play it as much.<br>  <br>  This football that you refer to.

And where a game can end in a 0-0 tie, and have people refer to it as a "beautiful game".  Yeah, I've seen it.  <br>  <br>  To be honest, if most soccer games were like the U.S.-Italy match in the 06 World Cup, more Americans would watch.  No flopping, good play, speed, lots of shots on goal from both sides, and blood was spilled on both sides numerous times.

d1b38b13b953ba1dbaf4d9bcd50f9de4aa	Gloves generally come in numeric sizes similar to shoe sizes. Sizes generally start at size 4 for younger keepers, and go as high as 12 for adult keepers. Most companies offer half sizes, but the half size model is not popular in some markets (United states for example, where half sizes are rare). Most of the glove companies will have a sizing chart on the packet, or pouch the gloves are sold in. Since each company sizes differ (some to a great extent) the chart is usually somewhat worthless. <br>  <br>  <br>  The only real way to discover which size is right for you are to try them on. You may find a 9 in one brand fits you just right, while a 9 in another brand are ill fitting. There is a lot of debate on how gloves should be worn. Loose, tight, a size larger, a half size smaller, etc….The only thing that matters is how comfortable the glove is for the goalkeeper who will be wearing them. In the 80’s and early 90’s, many companies suggested gloves to be worn a size larger to ease stress on the seams connecting the latex to the glove body itself. <br>  <br>  <br>  It stands to reason that the tighter the glove, the more stress is placed on the seams. In this day and age however, most gloves are constructed of flexible body material that molds to your hand, an offers more give than gloves of past. The bottom line is that the best way to find a size that suits you, is to try as many gloves on as possible with the features important to you. Keep a mental note of the size that works in each particular brand giving you an opportunity to purchase gloves without trying them on. Generally companies sizes will stay with the same sizing on their models for long periods of time.

You achieve them through years of stretching. Stretching your muscles and tendons several times a day, everyday, for a couple of years in the only way to attain a full split.|`|4SYFHXZmaa	I've done martial arts for 12 years now.  Some people can do it and others can't.  It depends on your body type and joints.<br>  <br>  However, if you want to improve your split, work on it little by little.  Each day stretch out morning and night.  By stretching all muscles, not just trying to do just splits, but pikes, butterflies, etc.  The main thing to do when stretching is to breath, it relaxes the muscles.  So hold each stretch for 15 deep breaths, or even longer if you want.<br>  <br>  Be patient it doesn't come over night.  The more you work, then better you become, just like anything else you do in martial arts and life.|`|UHTcpdkVaa	Warm up your muscles by running, or jumping jacks, or what have you.<br>  <br>  Do a number of high leg kicks to warm them up further, and to work on your dynamic stretching.  While they are nice and warm, stretch as far as you can without pain (uncomfortable good, pain bad).  Do this frequently (at least twice a week, the more frequent, the less time it will take), and eventually you will get it.

Zp65xPQyaa	To speed up arm/hand reflexes get a 5 or 10 pound dumbbell in each hand and start throwing punches. overtime the muscles that you use for reflexes will strengthen and allow for quicker refexes. For feet get a weight vest (5 or 10 pounds will work) and set up something like cones every few feet in the yard, and go through and weave back and forth in between them. It will help your shifting ability.

pmjOiQFvaa	okay these are the possible scenarios for randy orton taking in to account his recent push to stardom at wrestlemania:    1) Randy Orton beats The Undertaker.    It doesn't matter how he does it, if he defeats The Undertaker it would only be a sign of things to come for Orton's bright future. A victory over the biggest legend left on the roster would give Orton even more momentum heading into Wrestlemania as they wouldn't have something like that done without the serious intent of putting Orton "over" in a major way.         2) Randy Orton gets defeated by The Undertaker.    You'd think this would be bad right? Actually it wouldn't. I expect Shane McMahon to get some revenge and if Orton loses in the main event of Raw before No Way Out, it would be the classic heel-loss to make the fans think he'll receive more of the same before Orton beats Shane McMahon at No Way Out.         3) Randy Orton gets defeated by The Undertaker and loses to Shane McMahon at No Way Out.    Again, you'd think this would be the worse case scenario for Orton right? But it wouldn't be. If Orton lost to both The Undertaker and Shane McMahon, do you really think the WWE would kill all of his hype they've built up then have him lose at Wrestlemania? Losing to both two men would only set up a shocking Orton victory at Wrestlemania 25.|`|J2bLQcHNaa	Dunno just want Taker to win.|`|X9iZA9svaa	no they are fighting at wrestlemania|`|GhJtkZIKaa	Honestly, I am excited but this could be a big disappointment because all of Taker's matches have been big disappointments lately in which he spends the match just throwing punches and getting dominated by his opponent before he puts on the Hell's Gate submission for literally two seconds to win the whole match. He isn't doing his normal moves and has become boring in the ring and a lot weaker throughout 08 and recently so this could be a big disappointment|`|4THkC6Pgaa	well i'm glad kane is in the chamber at no way out but he could either turn on undertaker or help him in his match against orton.|`|EmUqxoN2aa	Undertaker does not NEED any help to beat somebody. He even could handle Rhodes, Dibiase and Orton in a three against one match. You could watch him for many years, so you should know him better. Taker has this philosophy either win or go down trying but with pride. What is he, a wrestler or a princess?) I think the match again Orton (and Legacy) is a great challenge for him to give his best. Other people need help to beat their opponents in hard matches, but not so The Undertaker, and if he can't handle the match he will get pinned, so what?|`|tQNF7i7Baa	nah orton is under 30 while taker is over 40. orton will win and become the champion at WM.

Dino Ciccarelli was a pest who could score (11 30 goal seasons).  He played in 2 Stanley Cup finals, and his 73 career playoff goals are 13th on the all-time list|`|lYnkvRASaa	he scored 608 career NHL goals- that should be relevant.  An argument can be made that he should be in the HHOF|`|p4H61jQDaa	he was a retarded hockey player that hit people with sticks and was charged for indecent exposure.|`|Jh7r1mhhaa	Ciccarelli was in the NHL Right Winger for close almost 20 years.  He played with several teams, but most closely associated with the Minnesota North Stars (now the Dallas Stars) where he began his career.  While not among the league elite, he was a skilled player scoring over 100 points three times in his career.  He also scored set a Washington Captials record by scoring seven points in a single game in 1989 (I don't think Ovie has broken that one yet).  He was also skilled at getting under the skin of opposing teams.  But as the first response suggested, you may know him because of his more controversial history.  He was arrest in 1988 after on-ice attack against a Toronto Maple Lead defenceman with his stick.|`|XqMWLvJDaa	He was considered one of the best players to not win a stanley cup.  He was the top point scorer for the Minnesota North Stars/ Dallas Stars until Mike Modano.  He spent almost the entire 1980s with the North Stars.  He spent the 90s with the capitals, red wings, lighting, and ended his career with the panthers. He might be best known for his hit on a Maple Leaf player which resulted in a conviction of assault and a small jail sentence.  A couple years ago, I remember hearing about a debate on whether he should be considered for the hall of fame or not due to his conviction.  I hope this helped.

Fans from each team will advocate and use some harsh words if their team is insulted. I think that is just normal, but the sad thing is people in present time always forget their past.<br>  <br>  Fans who are recently been a fans because of the commercials put on TV are just going with the flow. They don't know anything about the sports. If they heard that Yao Ming is the best center in the NBA, many will believe it immediately, if they heard that Kwame Brown is the best power-forward of all-time, many will also be a part of it. <br>  <br>  A true fan likes to cheer on his team of whatever comes in the way.

bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	Dawkins will stay. The Eagles are letting him sit out there for now to see what kind of price he will demand. He will probably go for lower than normal wages, but the Eagles want to make sure they don't over pay for him and can still address their other needs first. Whatever they have left over, Dawkins will get. Philadelphia is in a tight cap position after signing Samuel and now McNabb. They also have to try to figure out which tackle they can keep.|`|V29AonY7aa	It's a tough decision. I would personally like to see him stay for one more season. However, he is a veteran, and Andy Reid isn't shy about letting people go, even if they've been there awhile (Jeremiah Trotter for example). But bottom line is that Brian Dawkins wants to be there, and he is the unquestioned leader of the team, so I believe he will be staying.|`|wf5M2j8Jaa	They are working  things out right now. They are keeping it quiet and may even let him look at other teams and then make him an offer.|`|785ucP3uaa	I hope to God they resign him.

tT4VpcqRaa	Height and arm span won't matter unless you are a goalie.<br>  A water polo workout looks like this:<br>  200 meter warm up<br>  100 m breaststroke<br>  4x25 m sprints<br>  25 m eggbeater<br>  25 m eggbeater hands out<br>  25 m eggbeater elbows out<br>  25 m eggbeater arms out<br>  passing the ball<br>  shooting the ball<br>  and then whatever your team may be working on<br>  <br>  You should definitely swim a lot, the main stroke being freestyle. You should be able to swim 100 m in 90 seconds, for frosh water polo.<br>  Also, work on swimming freestyle head up, as this is how you will swim in a game.<br>  Make sure when you sprint head up that your head is straight. You can practice this by focusing on a point at the end of the pool. Also, your elbows should be nice and high, and your strokes short and choppy. <br>  Also, you need to learn eggbeater. This is mainly how you will stay afloat during the game. It's hard to explain over the internet, but this video should be helpful <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR5S04vYe2I" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR5S04vYe...</a><br>  Once you are able to eggbeater well, try to do it hands out, elbows out, and then arms all the way outstretched.<br>  Water Polo is an intense sport, so you'll want to make sure you have strength. I'd recommend a little bit of weight lifting up to bench pressing maybe 100 lbs, depending on your size.<br>  Also, go on runs to make sure you have cardiovascular strength.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  NUMBER ONE THING IN WATER POLO (besides swimming)<br>  LEGS!!!!<br>  Do squats, squats with weights, run, abosultely anything you can think of to strenghten your legs.<br>  <br>  <br>  this may seem kind of spaced out, but feel free to email me with any specific questions.<br>  molly.watkins.2012@gmail.com

LnJjS8BRaa	if you got it in three months but get your tail handed to you nine times of 10 by white belts at any other school what have you really accomplished?<br>  <br>  Just start training and you'll get it when you get it. Your ability is going to matter far more than the belt. Don't think about martial arts as earning belts, think of it like the training it is.<br>  <br>  Your progression really depends on too many factors. Again, you're looking to learn to fight or defend yourself or to stay active, these are skills and activities you should continue for your whole life, why worry about a relatively short term goal for getting a strip of clothe to wear around your waist?<br>  <br>  Jump in and have fun, good luck!|`|3DnX9NmAaa	How are you going to have time with your BJJ class 8 times a week?

u2QhQAxzaa	Dude, no way, Ariza is a defensive specialist.  Thats the whole reason the Lakers traded for him.  Fisher is a good defender, but he leaves his man open way to much to help.  Thats why the dam Warriors hit so many open 3's on us.  Ariza gets at least 2 steals a game and is always guarding the best player on the other team when Kobe is out.|`|50bEHtYfaa	at defense Ariza. <br>  <br>  At offense Fisher. <br>  <br>  Fisher is more of a offensive player. You don't see him block much or get rebounds, cuz pau and bynum do all that. Ariza gets blocks and rebounds. <br>  <br>  Ariza = defense<br>  Fisher = offense|`|reIMLCKkaa	Dfish is vet. He has helped Kobe straighten out this team as much as anyone. He demands respect and is a great shooter and defender. He has proved himself year in and out. Ariza is too young to compare to him yet. Whats up with all these guys are getting compared to greats after 1 or 2 good seasons or games?|`|ZCHmhuFQaa	Ariza, he improved his jump shot over the summer and did you see those clutch threes against the Warriors? Clutch! And also he is really,really tall and be a great blocker.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	i would prefer ariza<br>  a versatile player with better defense (in my opinion) and plays with more energy<br>  i dont understand why he isnt a starter|`|yt05KPhBaa	Trevor Arizaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. He won the game against the Warriors with those two straight threes and he's lockdown from Small Forward to Point Guard.|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	Trevor Ariza because he makes more defensive stops on other players and averages 1.5 steals per game and .4 blocks per game and Derek Fisher averages 1.3 steals per game and .1 blocks per game so that why Ariza is the better defender.|`|65H77wolaa	fish,good in getting offensive foul, he's the lakers best actor,<br>  three point shot, a lil good in d<br>  <br>  ariza, can play d, or maybe a lockd down defender<br>  he developed his outside shooting,<br>  <br>  so right now fisher<br>  next year its gonna be ariza|`|j6NImFHgaa	Yeah that is true, Fisher knows how to shut people down on defense but Ariza is coming though, he's young and can only get better at it.|`|HiuNSScLaa	idk but just from watching highlights of this ariza character hes learning from kobe and is gonna be GREAT like oj mayo and mario chalmers|`|HNQU9V6Haa	i think fisher because of his experience

nQlwiHfLaa	Why not wear a Leafs t-shirt under the Van jersey, instead of another jersey?|`|65ebebf5e438864d41850ef2be37319caa	Not a bad idea from a sentimental stand point (I'm a Leafs fan myself, with an unwaivering love for Sundin), but you might get really hot. Those polyester jerseys are pretty suffocating, let alone two at once. The ink shouldn't get messed up as long as it was signed with a Sharpie, or something along those lines.|`|tW8fh4IGaa	Very unique idea, but that might be just a bit uncomfortable wearing two jerseys at once. As far as messing up the ink, I think you should be fine as long as it wasn't signed within the past few hours.<br>  <br>  I say go for it as long as the two jerseys fit over each other.|`|DbfG5Cpraa	sundin's heart isn't with the leafs lol|`|13wBSFe5aa	I say go for it... unless.... you get too hot!<br>  <br>  Then you're going to have  to make a decision on which one you like best.. or .. wear one part of the day, then switch out and wear the other one.<br>  <br>  Have fun !!!  :o)|`|WwdUU0F9aa	depends on if the ink set, then you'll be find, I think it's a show of a true fan, nice idea.|`|HsJiUVkYaa	why would you wear a signed jersey anyways?|`|76nTvO4iaa	I think the sentiment is sweet.<br>  <br>  If they're signed with Sharpie Permanent, you shouldn't have to worry about bleeding.|`|2iuZdBXraa	Signatures should be ok, I'd chance it.

65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	I tend to agree with you, I don't think he could break 20 minutes.  He is an amazing sprinter, but it would take him months of training to break 20 mins in a 5k.  There is a big physical difference in the way elite sprinters and elite mid to long distance runners are built.  The traits that help one don't help the other.<br>  <br>  As for being able to beat him in that race, I'd believe that.  At track practice my senior year, I beat the #2 sprinter in our state over 100m at the end of a practice.  The practice wasn't that long for me (lots of sprint repeats with long recovery, I was a mid distance guy), but was absolutely brutal for him.  So how do you thing Usain Bolt would be feeling by around the 1 mile point of a 5k?|`|AA10451072	Yeah, you probably could.<br>  <br>  <br>  He's a sprinter.<br>  <br>  <br>  Not designed for running a 5k.<br>  <br>  I'm sure though, for the Olympics he ran long days over 25 miles..<br>  <br>  I'm guessing he could run it in 17.<br>  <br>  Not too hard to beat, I run it in 17:12.|`|KjRQysyZaa	I think you're probably right. I mean, to do well in a 5K you must have trained a lot more than 3 or 4 miles on a regular basis. I highly doubt he's done more than 3 or 4 miles in practices since he's a 100 runner. <br>  <br>  Plus, you have to factor in the amount of time he would spend pumping his fists and showboating, which would put him well over 20 minutes considering how much of it he did in a 100 meter sprint :)|`|IITnJjAjaa	Sprinters and distance runner's are completely different. They have completely different muscle fibres therefore i reckon he could only run an average 5km. I agree with you, he wouldn't do well he's built completely different to a distance runner. He couldn't do sub 20 i reckon.|`|J6xmZqj1aa	He did a 400 a few week ago in 46 something, and he was completely spent after wards, and in a lot of pain, no messing around.  I bet he couldn't get under 18, he is the fastest man ever, but not allot of endurance.|`|CtwEFHcqaa	I'd be willing to bet he would be able to break at least 16:20. If he ran at the pace he runs the 100 meter he could break 10 minutes!! That'd be insane but of course impossible. I think not even sub-20 is harsh, I think he could do a lot faster than that.|`|1UID5JtNaa	I think he could run 6 min pace, or 18:30.  Just a wild guess though because I cannot find anything referencing distance training that he might be doing.   It 's certainly possible that he cannot break 20 min.|`|e913314056b0ff092cd25829149fdd7faa	You would come by him to win because he is built and trains for the 100 yard dash.|`|vXkPUOWdaa	prolyl 22.99|`|3Z510Kzkaa	id say 15-17min
ZDOUwJsbaa	Plain and simple answer Garrett is that they know something is different. They may not know what but they know something isn't like it is  every other time they go there to feed. Deer are not smart animals. However they are very weary animals. Deer are not predators they are prey. After thousands of years of being hunted by man and beast they are well aware of this fact. Deer only have three things in life to worry about. Eating, procreating and not becoming dinner for someone or something. Their senses are keenly attuned for these three tasks. <br>  <br>  So that being said, the deer can either see you, hear you or smell you. Cover your scent, cover your movements, and don't make noise. If you do these three things the deer will not sense that something is amiss and will have no reason to avoid the areas that they normally feed in. Good luck. The three things you need to do can be very difficult.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	They have calenders, and know when hunting season is.  I personally think they all head out of state during that time to hide.  The crafty buggers.|`|nBUDjyhgaa	Deer ain't stupid.|`|EBw32eQYaa	They may be smelling your scent and are afraid to come closer, you may need to use a different way to get to your hunting spot or use a cover scent and make sure that you are scent free. Also it may be a good idea to use calls or rattle antlers to lure them in.|`|AA11850523	do they smell your scent<br>  do you move too much<br>  do they see you <br>  <br>  you dont give details on what you wear , how you prepare ( wash your skin and hair ,  mouthwash, how you wash , store your camouflage clothes|`|5qzndqYQaa	They can smell you. Don't move. If you have money set up a tree stand and wait.<br>  P.S. If it is a open field you don't need to get close just sit back and shoot them.|`|itiLu3dRaa	Deer are not as stupid as humans.
GL3TbtHBaa	No, everybody is switching to Digital, not High Definition, which is extra $. I dont think they will be in HD, but theres no reason that they shouldnt do both.<br>  <br>  And Speed doesnt actually film the race. F1 films it and SPEED broadcasts it. Commentary occurs in the States. So all the limitations are are FIA/F1's fault.|`|ab3efd718c864b03946535d2dc7dfbfbaa	I know that TSN in Canada has been broadcasting in HD for over a year, it is too bad that the US does not get TSN as they take the announcers feed from ITV in the UK and they are 100 times better than Speeds announcers.|`|O4CimCZuaa	Speed will resume broadcasting the F1 races during the season with all the regular announcers (Bob, David, Steve, and Peter). Usually they will say if another network will broadcast some races like last year FOX broadcasted I believe it was either 4 or 5 races but the problem with that was those races FOX showed were not live coverages; they were pre-recorded while Speed shows everything live! And I do think that they will be shown in HD.|`|Osmyhvc7aa	It will definitely be in HD.  Every station is switching to HD and SPEED already is as well as ABC so I know they will be in HD.
