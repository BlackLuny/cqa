20090205092141AAmDHxw	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Can Checking Fuel Injectors This way Be Done?	I've always wondered about something, but never really done it. Regardless of the year, make ,and model of a car is it possible to check fuel injectors in the following manner?       For example a 6 cylinder car.        !.  Disable the ignition so the car doesn't start.      2. Disconnect the fuel rail from the engine, but leave the injector wiring and injectors connected to the rail.      3. Suspend the rail above the engine with the injectors hanging down.      4. Make up some sort of supply line to connect the suspended rail back to the engine so that fuel can reach the injectors when the engine is cranked.      5. Put a pan under the injectors to catch the fuel and crank the engine.      Logic tells me that this would work, and it would be a good way to observe the spray pattern  of the injectors, and to see if all the injectors are firing without the use of special tools or equipment.      I'm an amature mechanic, but I'm very interested in hearing what the pros have to say about this.

After only 80 miles   the fuel light started coming on and going off, the fuel needle arm was going up   and down with the light, and, of course, the chime. Engine ran fine -no   sputtering or hesitation. The "check engine" has been on for a few months -   my mechanic said he couldn't read the code and must have been proprietary   and I haven't had it back since. I must say that sometimes on a hot day and   stopped at a red light, it smells like it's running rich. And also about 6 weeks   ago, I had to get to the cable on the battery and did not re-install the air filter   housing. I will gladly edit this if any questions come up. Thanks!!

And since I have been hearing some good reviews about Toyota I wouldn't mind looking into it. The best looking cars from the Toyota line in my opinion are the Rav4 and Camry, I guess its because I've seen a lot of them customized. How do they handle on the road after months? Are there any obvious defects to these vehicles? Bottom line, are they worth the purchase?

After I changed the transmission oil , gasket and filter (which by the way the oil was reddish black) it shifts hard. Did I fry my transmission?

20090205105804AA0TS9J	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Help! Car registration troubles! Need to get out of a ticket!!?	My friend bought a truck for me back in 2006 as a gift. We went together and got it registered and titled in her name so she could sign it over to me as a gift when the new title came in. Unfortunately before that could happen, we had a falling out and the title never got signed over to me and is still registered in her name. Well...I drove the truck on tags that had been expired since November of 2007 until November of 2008 and actually got pulled over and cited for the tags a year after they had expired. Here is my current dilemma. In order to get out of the ticket, I need to sell the car, salvage it (because its not running at the moment), or get the tags renewed. Without a title, I can't do any of that. Any advice or similar situations?

20090205112635AAAkRN4	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My car vibrates severely at low rpm as of this morning.  What is likely the problem?	I drive a 1994 Honda Civic, and the oil is long overdue (4 months) for being changed, but is not low, and has previously been twice as overdue and low enough to not give a reading.  My tire has been extremely low for the past few days, so I've been even more careful than normal about slowly accel/decelerating and turning at slow speeds.  If it's relevant, the car is MT.      This morning, a few minutes into my trip, my car suddenly started vibrating severely when I would give it gas from a stop.  This was normal, 45mph city driving.  This happens even in neutral, and goes away after about 4k rpm.  It is most severe in the 1.5-2.5k range.  Also, it seems to be idling lower than normal, and feels like it's going to die (but hasn't ever died yet).      What would anyone guess the problem could be?  And how much should it cost to fix?      Thanks!

Our names appear on the same bill, but we said when we got the policies together that only he would drive his truck 100% of the time, and only I would drive mine.  I hit a deer while driving his truck and seriously wrecked all his undercarriage.  Is his truck still fully covered in his name even though I was driving, or will Geico take it from my collision-only policy and bill me the rest?  If Geico considers that it's my fault, will they determine his truck is not covered at all since I was driving?    Will both or either of our rates rise?  Will this add points to my DMV record?  Should I just spend a few thousand dollars out of pocket (which I can't afford) to avoid having an unavoidable accident on my record and on his truck's vin?  Thanks for any help.
