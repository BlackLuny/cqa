20081013114947AAkpkhC	Environment;Global Warming	Is global warming a matter of belief?	If you believe in it, why do you?      If you don't, why don't you?      Is there irrefutable proof that it exists or that it doesn't?
20081004091541AAXjvMI	Environment;Global Warming	Has climate change whether man-made or natural changed the rainfall patterns where you live yet?	If so how have the patterns changed?
20081003082620AACpVuf	Environment;Global Warming	What has ever been proved beyond doubt?	In the field of science, show me one thing that has ever been proved beyond doubt, that is not still open to question by science.      While you're at it, you can cite me one peer reviewed paper that conclusively contradicts AGW.      One last request; Show me a scientific paper disproving the existence of God.
20081004073452AAb3oFd	Environment;Global Warming	What would happen if....?	I have a conspiracy theory of my own, everyone seems to like them round here!      I reckon that the power and welath of the media in the US is to some extent dependant on the denial of AGW. Imagine what would happen if they 'changed their minds' on AGW, what would happen?

20090130144536AAVPoUV	Environment;Global Warming	What’s is going on here? ?	It seems as if alternative universes have collided on Yahoo! Answers.      In our universe CO2 is a greenhouse gas; greenhouse gases slow infrared radiation from escaping to outer space; something that is turning less alkaline is also becoming more acidic; when CO2 dissolves in water, it reacts to form a balance of free carbon dioxide (CO2 (aq)), and carbonic acid.  More dissolved CO2 equals more acid.      In the alternative universe, the law of physics have broken down and are completely the opposite of what they are here.  What is going on here???

20090130185401AAOLzRd	Environment;Green Living	How would you like to promote an alternative energy lifestyle and make money at it?	This is a theoretical question. I believe there are a lot of people who would like to do something to help the envoironment and make a positive contribution, but they don't know how they could afford to make a real tangible contribution. They are just struggling along financially themselves. Suppose you could join an "Ecological-Network" and have an opportunity to simply talk about viable alternatives in energy systems and lifestyle and make money when the people you talk to also join the Eco-Network? There are no minimum purchases, no inventory, no recurring monthly purchases, no financial obligations of any kind (I hate that kind of stuff). It would be simple....you join by purchasing  a "T" shirt or ball cap, coffee mug, or bumperstickers (your choice). They all say something like..."I drive on Nuclear Fusion (Sun Power) Ask me how". or, "There are homes that use no fossil fuel for heating or cooling, ask me about it." When someone you spoke to joins, you get a referral fee. If they enroll someone, they get a referral fee and so do you, etc. through five levels of referrals. The "T" shirts, coffee mugs, ball caps, bumper stickers are all about alternative zero energy homes and electric cars and solar panels. There are companies who offer these alternatives to the public. The "plot" is to make these alternatives known to more people. When someone who joined the Eco-Network found someone who bought from one of the companies, that person and all his referres above him would get a "finder's fee" based on the value of the sale. You help connect people who are in a position to make a tangible difference in their purchases with an alternative product company. Does that sound like a concept that you think people would be interested in supporting? I just want some input on the "idea" the "Eco-Network" does not exist at this time. www.isomax-az.com has a start on this idea, but there are no "T" shirts, etc. available yet...it's just an idea...What do you think of the idea?

20090130181620AAtXYtP	Environment;Global Warming	Even if you thought global warming didn't exist, wouldn't it still be nice to clean up our acts?	i mean, look at the way we're living, fish are living in rivers we poluted, animals loosing homes. People dying because of poor air quality in cities thanks to smog. people in third world countries are getting sick because factories are polluting their drinking water.    i mean, its only selfish not to clean up your act. "i don't care about no fish!"  "i don't care about YOUR drinking water! it will cost money for ME to clean YOUR water! so why should i do it?"      i mean, if anything, for most individuals, going green saves you money. saving electricity, buying greener vehicles...i mean, its a win win situation, why not do it?
