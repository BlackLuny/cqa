My willy is nineteen inches long. Don't you believe me?|`|3e6175bba38d844ea9a99e1eab5894b2aa	Yes, and they also do things they would not do without being under the influence.  It is a sad truth but it happens all the time.  As a social worker a few years ago, I had a guy tell me he had not been drinking in weeks when he reeked of beer. (9:00 AM) and he considered himself to be responsible because instead of driving when he was drunk he had his 10 year-old son drive.  Life is like that|`|v0LWgN33aa	For getting rid of it yes!    I like a "Slow comfortable screw"|`|jbTNER3caa	I personally don't have this problem.  But, yes, for some people it definitely makes them tell the truth, or secrets.  One of my sister and my good friends admitted to us that she was a lesbian when she was fall down drunk.  She had been thinking about tell us two because we're close and she felt she could trust us.  We obviously promised not to tell anyone since she wasn't ready to come out to everyone yet.  As if that wasn't bad enough, on a later occasion, my sister (again had been drinking quite a bit) went and told a couple of her friends that the first friend was gay...  Luckily they were friends from college (the lesbian is from home) so they didn't know her or anything.  But yeah, people need to know their limits.  Haha.    And favorite cocktail would probably be  Cosmos or Porn Stars.|`|7gfNIajYaa	Oh my gosh,yes!!You can control the things you want to say sometimes depending on what it is.

doz7RIoeaa	The term "eggplant" describes the general shape of the vegetable that were originally exported to the US (egg shaped) and the inside of the Asian (where I believe the vegetable originated) variety of eggplant which has a soft consistency like an that of an  egg.   "Aubergine" is Sanskrit in origin which when roughly translated means  "a cure for wind disorders" which means it was used to treat gas (or farts if you will). It was once though that eggplants were effective in alleviating stomach gas.|`|I5P2bbgWaa	its related to the belladonna plant and was thought to be poisonous until the 1700s|`|glynFK9haa	It's called that because it's shaped like an egg!|`|DFXS4SB4aa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggplant|`|9kCr7i7Waa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggplant    history etc is on wikipedia    I love eggplant especially eggplant parmesan :D    hope this helps|`|uq4ZuWnEaa	Egg Plant is only used in America.

However, if there is a cork style lid, it does tend to dry out over time.  This could let air in and ruin a perfectly good bottle of Scotch!  If the bottle is unopened, then you can store it in your wine rack to keep the cork moist.    Once it's been opened, store it upright and every once in a while, just hold the cap and turn the bottle over gently a few times to moisten the cork.  This will keep the seal.

I've never had a honey lager or even seen one, but I've had a couple of honey wheats.

717gAvUQaa	There are so many factors that go into this that you have to be the judge. My method is to stick it right up to my face and take a big whiff. Bad food usually smells bad. If that doesn't work, take a little nibble. It won't kill you but you'll notice an off taste if its bad. I generally believe that any leftovers are good for about a week. After a week, I begin to start my big sniff test. Things don't usually go bad without you noticing if you smell and take a small taste.

AA10928232	This is an excellent recipe, but calls for chicken breasts.  I don't see why you couldn't marinate your chicken wing pieces in the marinade overnight in the fridge, then grill or bake the next day.  If you want to reserve the marinade to useon the cooked chicken, be sure to boil it down first.    Tequila Lime Chicken    1/2 cup gold tequila   1 cup freshly squeezed lime juice (5 to 6 limes)   1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice (2 oranges)   1 tablespoon chili powder   1 tablespoon minced fresh jalapeno pepper (1 pepper seeded)   1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic (3 cloves)   2 teaspoons kosher salt   1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper   3 whole (6 split) boneless chicken breasts, skin on   Combine the tequila, lime juice, orange juice, chili powder, jalapeno pepper, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add the chicken breasts. Refrigerate overnight.   Heat a grill with coals and brush the rack with oil to prevent the chicken from sticking. Remove the chicken breasts from the marinade, sprinkle well with salt and pepper, and grill them skin-side down for about 5 minutes, until nicely browned. Turn the chicken and cook for another 10 minutes, until just cooked through. Remove from the grill to a plate. Cover tightly and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature.      --Ina Garten
vTfEYeKQaa	Try that new stuff called Truvia. I just bought it, and it's surprisingly good. It doesn't have that funky after taste like splenda, and it's all natural. It comes from the stevia plant, and a blend of natural sweeteners like those found in grapes. Go to the truvia website and read about it. It's about the same price as splenda, but it tastes so much better. The first thing I noticed when I used it....it doesn't foam in liquids like splenda does lol. That's always a good sign. It's also zero calories.|`|AA12168969	You can use an all natural product, such as: Stevia powder/liquid.  It tastes really good!

BhuTa0idaa	i originally became a vegetarian by giving up meat for lent, and then found i couldn't go back to eating it after not eating meat for so long. my best friend did the same.<br>  <br>  it's kinda  weird because originally, obviously i was worried about animals on a basic level, but i feel as if i developed the wrong way round as i became vegetarian, and then started to feel serious about animal rights afterwards.<br>  <br>  anywho, good luck! you might end up like me and be vegetarian for real!|`|AA12116167	You don't always have to give up food related things for lent. However if that is what you wan to give up you can give up things like chocolate or coffee. <br>  Non-food related things include television, magazines, movies, and other forms of media. Internet and cellphones are also options, but often those are necessities. <br>  The whole point of giving up something for lent is to get rid of something you heavily rely on, and rely on God during that time instead.|`|r0xeCZAQaa	ha ha!  I want to give up being lazy (Dear Lord, I need your help!)<br>  <br>  Giving up meat is an easy one for Lent -- you're supposed to, although the Church allows fish (are you giving up all seafood as well?)<br>  <br>  I once gave up food and did a 40 day Master Cleanse fast.  I did a Juice Feast once (only juiced vegetables, fruits and blended vegetable/fruit smoothies)  <br>  <br>  I've been raw vegan for quite a while, so, now, the things I want to give up tend to be behaviors (I am back to where I was as a kid - I gave up hitting my sister once, which meant I got beat up a lot and had to sit there like a stupid idiot and take it -- she was really surprised when Lent was over, and I went back to defending myself, and I learned a lot about what turning the other cheek *really* means... okay, a priest helped me out by telling me that you are allowed to defend yourself in unfair situations)|`|yOK32PM9aa	I might give up Y!A, but 40 days is a long time...|`|2zHq2XIMaa	Not all vegetarians are religious, hence, not all vegetarians will be giving something up for lent. <br>  <br>  Most people give up things for lent out of tradition, not thinking about the religious aspect.<br>  <br>  Some people give up things for lent because it is a time when many other people are giving up something and it is easy to sustain or resist said item/food/beverage/habit because they feel they have a justified explainable reason.<br>  <br>  <br>  Many people will give up unhealthy "treats", alcohol, smoking, swearing, even biting nails and other for lent.. It isn't always to do with food.<br>  <br>  I presume most vegetarians, would give up something that they feel is holding them back in some way or something they can do without just fine.|`|YvNCOYZZaa	I'm not a Christian, so I don't adhere to their holidays or religious practices.  Therefore, I do not give anything up for Lent. <br>  <br>  I was taught Christian doctrine and I never understood how not eating a certain food for a few weeks was even close to the sacrifice that the Christians say that Jesus made.  Especially when I saw people give up things like Xbox or lipstick.  Menial things. <br>  <br>  If I were Christian, perhaps I'd give up, gee, I'm pretty minimalist as it is.  Ummm, perhaps I'd try going Vegan for that period of time.|`|ZhiYghZ1aa	well im giving up cookies, french fries, and biting my nails.<br>  you make me so happy by giving vegetarianism a try, i've been trying to get my friends to give it up for lent but they all say "i love meat" and "there's no way i could do it"|`|2Av3gIqgaa	I'm giving up chocolate.<br>  <br>  And...my boyfriend is giving up red meat for Lent.

V5xHaIAcaa	Yes,  they are fast  they are cost-effective  they are mostly healthy, by my definition  they are quite low in calories  they taste pretty good, by my definition    I recommend lean cuisine as a very reasonable compromise  esp. when compared to "fast/bad food"    Good question|`|wfWAlztVaa	It's easy to make  sometimes when I'm in a hurry, I can just make it in five minutes  Also, some of the food actually tastes pretty good!|`|L1aD8xIzaa	its good for you.....has no fat|`|vxTcvSYdaa	i eat it because i love flavorless foods that i can make in a few minutes! Boiling on the outside, frozen solid on the inside! yummm! and for those of you who want all the gag with none of the fat, and twice the price, there's LEAN CUISINE!    incase you didnt get it, that was sarcastic...|`|5ta5yyWSaa	Many people at my office would buy it because there are no close restaurants and the cafeteria was very expensive and had horrible food.|`|671f3681cd47b9e9abfd4c094d12f7a7aa	It just tastes good and it's cheap.|`|h9pva7ndaa	It's quick, cheap, easy, and somewhat healthy. Lots of sodium, but low fat and calories.   Some are actually really good.|`|POSSu6rcaa	because they're yummy, quick to make, and low in calories :)
QSPlsvTZaa	when you make sushi you use high quality fish and that makes it alot better to eat. people can get sick from it but it is uncommon at a sushi restaurant. raw meat is different because it is meat, and in a steak the bacteria is only on the outside so you can eat it when its raw on the inside but when you puncture the outside when the whole thing is raw, you have to make sure it is thourouly cooked|`|DFXS4SB4aa	Sushi grade fish is very fresh and very high quality. Fish isn't the only meat eaten raw though. Steak tartare is raw beef. There really isn't much risk at all though...people didn't always cook meat...before fire was discovered all meat was eaten raw...|`|FVkq5RRZaa	there's also california sushi, which is cooked, and very tasty!|`|5ta5yyWSaa	Sushi requires very high grades of fish and shellfish and buyers/sushi chefs that know how to prepare it. That is why very skilled sushi chefs can make more than 70k.  I have never gotten sick and began eating it at age 6.  There isn't any fermentation as the product is very fresh, kept chilled and thrown out if spoiled.|`|b121e2f7b2d398c44662e6d1126ba9d6aa	boy you have a lot to learn.     First Sushi refers to rice not raw fish.   Sushi can contain nearly anything from cooked pork to raw tuna, but it always contains sushi rice.     Next, cooking is simply a method of preparing food, it is not a must to keep people from getting sick.     You can eat ANYTHING raw, however you do need to know your risks.   Chicken is so laden with high levels of salmonella that it is not practical to eat it raw.       If you have fresh ingredients that are prepared and butchered correctly, it is very unlikely you will get sick.   You also need to be aware of parasites.   Pork has a history of parasites (this is a reason why jewish andMuslimss consider them unclean)   Many fish are notorious for parasites and therefore you don't see them on a sashimi (japanese raw fish) plate.|`|dIUvXolnaa	It the fact that Sushi refers to  the seasoned rice. The raw fish is called Sashimi and the fish is FRESH.|`|YYAu9lFDaa	sushi = rice not raw fish... sashimi = raw fish    lots of different types of sushi are cooked but as for the raw fish you're asking about they use high quality, extremely fresh fish and most of the chefs who prepare it are well trained w/ being very sanitary.    there are always risks in everything you eat.    but, i've been eating sushi 3-5 times a week for 5 years and i've never been sick... it all depends on where you go and how your body handles it.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	its fresh ,,the fish just died!

asXq2cFDaa	Because they don't know what supply and demand means.    Edit:Ashley, you do know people DIE every day as well right?  Veganism makes me feel good because I am not supporting it, therefor, not causing it.  Even if the difference is that small as the troll Ashley says it is, at least it is a difference.  Its not exactly saving animals....It's preventing them from being born. See the meat industry puts out so much meat, if a little less is being bought, a little less will be produced and maybe its only one a year that isn't born, but hell, I would rather never be born, than born into a hell hole known as a factory farm!    "Never doubt that a small group of though full committed people can change the world, indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."  ~ Margaret Mead    Thing will change one day.     Also, veganism does not help world hunger increase at all! If everyone would reduce there meat consumption by 10%, all the people that are going to starve to death this year could live.  And not all of us push our beliefs onto others, but if you ask us why we are vegan, or ask a question such as this, I am obligated to answer and since I do not agree, I feel obligated to tell you.  Simple as pie.  Ashley never factored in the fact that newborns DON'T eat meat.  lol!|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	You would think that reduced demand would mean reduced animal herd size but it's not true.  Excess milk products get dumped into the sea or salt mine to keep the price up.  And if the price of meat drops too low they cull the herds bury or render the bodies and wait till the price goes up again.|`|nDOWKhwCaa	Nope, sorry, but that logic just doesn't fly.     Unless you live in hick town that has only a few hundred people and is remote then whatever isn't eaten in a particular location will be exported out of the country or to a different location within the country. You also have to consider that more and more people are being born into the world every single day, and that 98% of these people will be meat eaters. Since the population continues to rise the demand for meat can only go up up up, it will never ever go down, not in any of our lifetimes anyways, and probably not ever.     Now i'm not saying that vegetarians don't make a difference, you do make a very slight difference in the production of meat. It's just that you are so disproportionately outnumbered that if your goal is to run your local grocer out of business by not eating meat that is a battle you will never win.|`|5FiO6aNCaa	"If you don't eat your meat, how can you have any pudding?!"|`|0xm2Dd1gaa	Because people realize that alot of people are gonna eat meat, now let me ask you a question, "How can you have any pudding when you don't eat your meat?" Man that is a good song|`|doz7RIoeaa	Actually there is some truth to that. Animals are always killed for a lot of reasons, food being the main but not the only purpose. Other people will eat meat.     No that's not accurate. First, 3 percent is a figure that will not affect the industry at all. You need to think in terms of 20-30% before any real impact is felt. What you will see however, is a decrease in price because of the slight over supply which will in turn make, say beef more affordable. This leads to an increase in individual average ( a pattern observed over the last 5 years despite increases in the number of vegetarians) consumption or increase in overall consumption as those who can't afford to eat beef on a regular basis, now can. More animals will actually be killed and profits remain steady. And there is the increasing foreign demand to factor in. US beef is in fact more available abroad than it has even been.   Second, be realistic. You don;t seriously think farmers or ranchers are watching monitorsand saying "Oh wow another one became a vegetarian, lets breed one less cow, 4 less chickens etc etc ".  That's a fantasy that pro vegetarian/anti meat group hope you will believe. Like that "100 animals a year saved" myth posted by others.   The supply and demand scenario will work only if the population is static not dynamic.     But then again, statistics are not the real reason why you are a vegan are you? Who cares if it does not make an impact on others. It makes an impact on you and you are living your life the best way you know how. That's what is really important not what others  say.|`|I5P2bbgWaa	Im a vegetarian for health..You cant change the world   you can change how you effect the world  Ive been a veg 29 yrs..  There are still circus animals and industrial farms  the oceans are more depleted thn 30 yrs ago  you cant change the world|`|cVZDVVthaa	When you cook meat, you release Co2's.  Some vegans and vegetarians do say that but not all of them know the effects of NOT eating meat.|`|DQlZIzAFaa	Most people are dumb and don't understand supply and demand. If more people were vegetarian, there'd be less demand for meat, and less animals would be slaughtered. The same animals aren't going to be slaughtered anyways. Pay attention in Econ class people!!|`|8e6z8iUHaa	Because it's true. The meat market wouldn't decrease at all if 3% stopped buying animal products. There's no point in being a vegan if all you're after is to stop animal cruelty. I'm sorry, but it doesn't work that way. If being a vegan makes someone feel better about themselves, fantastic. But pushing your beliefs unto others never goes over well, and results in things like this.   If vegan lifestyle is part of your religion, great. If it's a health related decision, great. But if it's an attempt to stand up for animals and try to make a point or an example out of yourself, you're wasting your time. Sorry if that's not what you wanna hear, but eventually someone has to accept it.|`|H1aSslbiaa	i think people should respect other people choices,|`|175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	your logic is right. its supply and demand.    and i drank lactaid milk and was the only one in my house who did.  so i am making a difference because instead of buying a quart of lactaid every week i am now buying soy milk.. so the dairy farmers are losing 16 dollars a month on me!|`|B365rHNAaa	People say it because being vegan is pointless, everyone hates you anyway|`|a74cfe7d3b169985e25dc99f0dd9dcaeaa	mostly the reason why you don't eat meat is you believe in not killing animals.  So it doesn't matter if you don't eat meat and other does.

17c123a043ea813bbdbb18f16c4c2b58aa	I have been a vegetarian for 15+ years and a vegan off and on for the last 6 or so. I can tell you that you will have situations like this your whole life. Really, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter what anyone thinks about your beliefs. I try to be as non confrontational as possible, while at the same time letting the people involved know that I won't be swayed. No one likes a preachy vegan, and I really think it hurts the cause in general.     As far as what you should do about the sleepover, I think that you should have your friend talk to her parents. Have her tell them that you don't want to be a burden so you are going to be bringing your own vegan meal. If the parents object after you are trying to be so reasonable, then I don't know what to tell you. Some people just can't be reasoned with.     I think it is awesome that you have chosen the vegan path so young :) keep up the good work!|`|bd2502bab3c35dd94819ef873dd90e55aa	I'm a christian vegan and my "very" bible-believing family don't give me a hard time about it at all, so they being strangers and not even your family probably won't either.  I would eat before you go, bring a bit of something, and don't even mention it unless they bring it up.  say no thank you, maybe say you can't digest dairy products very well (which is probably true if you never have them), and that you're totally fine with whatever you brought.   seriously, people don't make as big of a deal about that stuff as you think they will sometimes.  they shouldn't anyway.|`|1asStWo4aa	I'm not a vegan, just a veggie, but I know how you feel. Although, I've only been a veggie for a few weeks now, I hate having to tell people I don't eat meat, especially when they make food for me. It makes me feel bad for not eating their food. My mom's a different story, she's my mom, she understands things like that, but other people are a problem.     I'm dreading this coming weekend actaully, since I'm going to be spending it with my best friend for the first time since I became a vegetarian, and I haven't seen her family in months, so last we talked I was a full blown carnivor. So I can definitely sympathize with the "strange" eating habits. For me, I told my friend that maybe she should warn them that I'm a vegetarian now, so that they would have time to think of a way to compromise, rather than bringing my own food, since well, in a way I think some people might find that a bit insulting.    Not so that they'll make food entirely without meat, but so they can make something for all of us.     If they can't make something I can eat at least on some level, instead of just straight up meat (and they're big on meat), then I'm planning on packing some snacks in my bag to eat on the side so at least I won't starve. If that doesn't work. . .I would be fully prepared to suffer not eating. But I really don't recommend that option, since I'm only staying there for a day and then spending the night and going home in the morning, plus I have a sort of eating disorder.     Some days, I can go the entire day without eating or drinking anything and not feel the slightest bit hungry. Other days, I starve all day long, but on "normal" days for me, when I've eaten and it's getting close to time to eat again, I don't feel as hungry as most people would.     Anyway, right, I don't know if that helps at all but. . .thought I'd at least try.|`|VH29BFuGaa	Explain to them that just because someone offers something  doesn't mean you have to always accept. Like a gift for  example. Also say I respect you're beliefs even though they  may be strange to me, Please return the favor.|`|B365rHNAaa	ach well, that's what happens when your trying to be different|`|587fd4cd625f006ee81a9a15c035ab3aaa	The easiest option would be to eat a big meal before you go. Surely they'll have chips or dips that can tide you over until you go home.   2. You could offer to bring a big cheese & veggies pizza yourself, or to make/bring a vegan  snack tray.  3. if  the daughter is a close friend, surely she is aware of your dietary preferences, and hopefully she will run interference for you.     Good luck!|`|slHUNl58aa	pizza dough is just yeast, water, sugar and oil..what if you brought your own and had the same meal only without the traditional toppings.  They will think you are weight watching and think nothing of it.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	If you are committed to being a vegan, bring your own food and the heck with what they think,. They didn't value your lifestyle so why should you worry about offending them?|`|MbSSIOpSaa	I think you should bring some of your own food, and make sure you have enough to share. If they ask, tell them you prefer not to eat meat and dairy. Explain your reasons if you need to...it's really not their job to try and push their beliefs on you and tell them that if you need to.|`|T11RWeaPaa	Hi,     First of all, being a vegan is your decision and personally i think that its no one else's business, but this is an uncomfortable situation.     You could either eat dinner before you go to your sleepover, and then explain that you had already eaten dinner, but thank you.    Or just try explaining to your friend that you are a vegan, and you would really like to go, but being a vegan is part of who you are, and if it is a disrespect to your parents you are very sorry, but being a vegan is your decision, i am sure she will understand and put out some snacks that you are able to eat.     You can also just politely say "oh i'm sorry but i don't like pizza, but thank you!" im sure they will bring you something else to eat.    another thing!  i know this is kind of sad, but once i had a similar problem i was so embarrassed that i ate a huge late lunch, brought a granola bar to the party and excused myself, went to the bathroom and ate it quickly! no one knew a thing! :)    try telling your friend the truth though!    Good Luck!|`|A5gfxSyzaa	I don't understand why anyone would judge a person based on their dietary choice, but if your friend's parents are like that then I can understand why you don't want to risk your friendship.  If you don't want to explain veganism to them you could just say that you have sever allergies and are on a restricted diet.  You could then offer to bring your own food.|`|0xm2Dd1gaa	Ok, the only advice I can give is that just pick the meat off of the pizza, if there is any. If that doesn't work, looks like you are gonna have to bring your own food, or give up your beliefs for one night, but other than that, i don't know.|`|asXq2cFDaa	I would ask your friend to tell them for you. If they ask why, try not going to animal rights, as they believe different. If worse comes to worse you can point out the bible says to respect others.  ;)  Even if they will not specifically buy things for you, there will probably be something you can have!!  I went to my friends sleepover, nothing vegan except clementines and oatmeal! I lives on that for a day and a half, lol! The bible does say NOT to judge someone, so I think it would be against the bible to judge you and not let you be friends with their daughter because of your belifs! It would also be quite un-bible like for them to judge you and ask you questions all night! Try your best to change the subject. If they ask why, say for the environment and your health. Its not a lie, those are good reasons to go vegan, your just not mentioning the animals, and those topics will cause less debate!  Good luck and do e-mail me if you need more help, I have been in that situation before!(well, a similar one!)|`|175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	actually we didn't start eating meat until Adam ate the sinful apple.    but just bring your own food.  you won't offend them since they know you are  vegan... just bring like a veggie burger and maybe some carrot sticks and hummus for a snack. if they made you special food then just keep your food in the fridge.    and if they are rude to you then just say you don't feel comfortable and leave.   i'd be pissed off if people started preaching the bible and promeat eating at me.. at a sleep over.    just.. good luck. thats all.    yea the dough probably has eggs in it, or milk. :\|`|Cdkd4oQ7aa	I would usually say, just don't worry about what they think. But I understand not wanting to be explaining yourself to them the whole night. You could bring your own food, and say you have dietary restrictions for your health. Just say you don't want to get into it if they press you.|`|wjEPVNezaa	Goodness: My Friend Knows, her parents don't    That's just asking for trouble.  Give your friend's parents the CHANCE to partially accommodate you.  Are you assuming that because they're religious they'll be completely unwilling to accommodate you?    Since you're having pizza, are you going to have salad also?  Then you can bring something protein rich like hummus and wheat crackers, and combined with the salad it's relatively filling.    Ask your friend what you're having, see if you can have anything, and bring some food to compliment what they're having.  Bring enough for everyone, because people really do like vegan food, so long as it's not tofu.|`|9HRkwzruaa	If nothing else, tell them that you have a food allergy or intolerance and will be bringing your own food.  I don't generally advise that, but if they would really judge you for your food choices, it's something to fall back on.    Be courteous, thank them for their hospitality, and quietly eat what you bring.  If it's something to protect your health, there's really nothing that they can say about that.    One thing though...do you know this about her parents from personal experience, or is this her take?  The Bible doesn't actually say that God put animals here as food for us...animals weren't even given as food till after the flood (Genesis 9, I think).  As in, fallen world, dealing with what we have till God gives us something better.  We're allowed to eat animals, but we're certainly not commanded to.  (I'm a Christian, I trained to be a Bible translator, I'm married to a pastor, and I'm a vegetarian, as is my son.)    If they have some weird misunderstanding of the Bible and would make a big deal out of it, say what you need to say and bring your own food.  Just be careful that you don't place that judgment on them out of no where though...it might be the furthest thing from the truth.|`|J54q2aVtaa	You could ask her parents to prove the existence of a god, and why they would devote so much of their life to something that very well might not even exist.    Don't bother asking for them to accommodate you.  By doing so, people will often see it as acting "high and mighty", which of course, it really isn't.    Bring your own food.|`|eshummTJaa	sorry dear...those parents are very wrong about the reason they give for the animals being here...they are mis using the word of God to promote their own gluttony...    the dietary laws are in Leviticus regarding clean and unclean....and only in moderation...    just mention to them that there is no death in heaven so there is no meat and we are all vegetarian in heaven...that is in the Bible... bring your own food for tummy safety...    your eating habits are normal...the meat eaters are the strange ones... do not apologize for being correct intelligent and healthy...why should vegetarians have to apologize and be made to feel odd because we are correct?|`|ZdfcC5kDaa	I hear your concerns and I totally relate... it really sucks being grilled about your beliefs, especially by adults who think they know it all lol.     What about saying that ur on a diet/trying to lose weight so you're trying to eat foods that are low in calories (ie fruits and vegetables)?  Say that you're bringing your own because you don't want to burden them with your diet.  Also, some medications (ie antibiotics for acne) require that no dairy be consumed for 1-2 hours after theyve been taken.  Perhaps you could offer this as reason for not eating the cheesy pizza?  You might also say you have a food allergy or are lactose intolerant, and that large amounts of dairy cause you to have an upset stomach?    It sucks that people can be so judgemental and I totally understand your desire to avoid being called the devil and having your beliefs undermined lol.  Hope this helps and have fun at the party girl! =)
bb8h33w8aa	You should give your body more time to digest your food before you go to bed.

8e6z8iUHaa	Honestly, dear, if he can't accept and embrace your differences, he isn't worth it. I know it's not that easy, but it's really not fair of him to do that. It doesn't matter at all, and he's an idiot not to realize that. You may enjoy being with someone who shares your beliefs or can at least accept them. There's really no way to convince him if his mind is made up. The best you can do is to move on and understand that it's his loss, not yours.|`|7kd8pUwgaa	If he won't accept you for who you are I would just forget about him.  If a guy ever told me that I would dump him right on the spot!  I've been a vegetarian for 7 years and I would not change that for anyone.  He sounds like a jerk, find someone better.|`|DQlZIzAFaa	If you're older and he's looking for a wife in the next two or three years, lifestyle choices like that can make or break a deal. If he loved you he wouldn't care what you ate. That said, he may not want a long-term relationship where he has to make his food separately because he wants meat and you don't. It also raises the question of whether to have vege kids, etc.     My bf recently went dairy and gluten free and it's been hard for me because I like to cook for him. Eventually we've found a balance - it's actually not that drastic of a lifestyle change and he doesn't mind it when I eat dairy or gluten. I can understand though that food choices can affect an intimate relationship, especially a long-term one.|`|asXq2cFDaa	I have dated non-vegans and all relationships where fine, veganism had nothing to do with them really!  As long as you both respect each others views you can have a healthy relationship. Since he can not respect you, there is no way it will work, i'm sorry!  Try sitting down and talking to him. Maybe say its just for health reasons so he will not stereotype you an an animal loving bafoon like a lot of people look at us as.  Don't listen to Ashley, she is just this sections troll.|`|zLere2oHaa	Thank you for being vegetarian and not changing your mind for him! He sounds like an asshole. With him still eating meat and treating you like that, there is no need to be with him. Also, there may be more to it and he's just using that as an excuse. (Some people will come up with the stupidest **** to avoid the truth.)|`|Ih7IRNGtaa	My boyfriend eats meat, and I've been a vegetarian for seven years. He respects my diet, and I respect his. It's a personal choice. He wouldn't criticize you for cutting out carbs, would he? No. He shouldn't try force you to choose between him and your diet. And for the people who say "omg vegetarians and meat eaters are just too different," I really do feel sorry for you. The fact that what someone orders is a deal breaker is kind of sad. You could be missing out on some incredible people, vegetarians or omnivores! As long as no one is pushing an agenda, it shouldn't be an issue. Ditch this guy and call his bluff. If he can't see past your garden burger, he's too shallow to deserve a relationship.    Oh, and "how would the children be raised, diet-wise"? I'd raise them to be healthy kids, which means limiting the McDonald's runs and red meat. But seeing as it is a personal decision, I'd let them choose when they're older just like I did. But I would buy free range meat and encourage them to be healthy. The healthy part is because I want my children to live long and be happy, though, and has nothing to do with being a vegetarian. ;)|`|imNwxcT8aa	if he doesnot get along with you in your eating preferences then probably you guys wont get along together in other things aswell.|`|B365rHNAaa	I went out with a vegan for 2 years and that didn't seem to bother me.  He really doesn't seem worth it|`|90eb7b4d45733c9e608cd1a4b43fd081aa	The logical thing to do is to look for someone with the same diet as you. Even if you are to get around it for now, it will start to make your lives inconvenient with time. Any relation of this sort is bound to end soon. My best advice to you is to look for another vegetarian. That way you will have that similarity to unite you, and you are bound to be together longer... and hopefully in marriage.|`|9ilXVowLaa	if he's being so silly about your diet,what other thinks about your life will he not be able to get past?|`|nDOWKhwCaa	I'm a meat eater and i would also not date a vegetarian. It's just too likely that because of our differing views on things that we will always be arguing. Not to mention what we would do if we ever had kids.|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	Thats stupid. My meat eatng teacher has a vegan girlfriend. They live together and somehow manage.|`|b9uOax0aaa	It does matter.  What would happen if you had children?  How would they be raised, diet wise?|`|llkSmgLJaa	Sweetie this is a red flag. Any guy that will not date a girl because of her diet sounds like a control freak. Be glad you found out ahead of time.|`|wjEPVNezaa	Forget it, move on.  Things can only get worse from here.|`|0xm2Dd1gaa	I'm not a vegetarian, nor do I want to be, mainly b/c I love to eat meat, but on to your question, if he cant get past you only eating vegetables, and not eating any meat, then it will not work out, and you should just move on, preferably to someone who does not care what you eat.|`|6nvhmx7Aaa	well it sounds to me like you should just skip out on this guy.    think about it: you dont really think this is a big deal, and he wont date you on something so petty    what says he wont break up with you when it is something that is a big deal? move on and save urself a heartbreak|`|lAQG15kdaa	Its good that you don't force it on people, i hate that, he should respect that. Anyway my brother is a veg and some of the things he eats are so good, tell him to be more open minded about it, and that vegetarian food is actually really good, he may like it!|`|175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	screw him then.    my boyfriend constantly gets mad that i'm vegan. apparently i told him when we first went out that i;d never go vegan (but was vegetarian).  and so he gets mad at it, like it directly effects him. (and gets so annoying to the fact that we almost break up b/c he's completely stupid)    ... you love him but you aren't dating? chances are you don't love him....?     and i wouldn't even bring it up just be like "your loss" and then he'll find you interesting and chase after you. don't be telling him you love him and don't even make you being a vegetarian a variable. you are a vegetarian because you want to be, so if he doesn't want to be w/ you based on that, then he is a loser!|`|NEp2RpVBaa	He sounds like an ignoramus. Why even bother with this guy? He must not be into you enough if he will let something like that stop him having a relationship with you. Forget the guy|`|9HRkwzruaa	Honestly...if he's immature enough to not date you based on your eating habits, he's really not a guy you want to be with.  He's got a lot of growing up to do.|`|J54q2aVtaa	Kick him to the curb immediately.      What a scumbag.|`|bPZlpe0taa	He sounds selfish,i would tell him to accept you or get fucked|`|wdvUNvz6aa	thats wierd. i would say he wasnt worth your time over breaking up with you over something so silly.

BbK0fA4Laa	Seems pretty healthy. However, Aside from the tomato you are not eating any fruit. To have a balanced diet you need, throughout your day, all food categories included in your eating. As a vegetarian those food categories should be as follows: fruits, vegetables, grains, seeds & nuts, and legumes.    Edit: 110 is an excellent weight for your height. Trying gaining a little muscle mass if you can though. You don't need to become a body builder or anything like that but a little extra muscle does help.|`|bd2502bab3c35dd94819ef873dd90e55aa	Much better than a lot of daily food intake of some vegans!  I am the same height and weight but I eat a bit more.  like 1500-2000 cal.|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	sounds good to me|`|4pco9j9Faa	It seems like a very well-balanced vegan diet to me. Make sure you take B12 supplements, though, because the only naturally reliable source of B12 is from meat or supplements, and not getting enough can seriously harm you in the long-term. No need to eat meat, but supplements can help ensure you get your nutrients.|`|7xkwE3X9aa	That seems pretty healthy to me!  I know what you mean about the bad gas :/  I love lentils and black beans and they are awful(if you know what I mean).|`|asXq2cFDaa	I would say try to have a more nutritious dinner.  Instead of the fries, try some Pasta, or a veggies soup, you can mix tofu into that as well! Overall, sounds good!  Maybe add some steamed kale to dinner or something!|`|3FiQaNgBaa	What is your height and weight?    It does seem as if you are eating a good range of foods, but it does not seem like quite enough. If your calorie calculations are correct, you are eating about 1330. I do not know your height and weight, but generally you should keep your calorie range at least around 1500.    Perhaps try having some soy milk with dinner and one of your snacks, add another bar in there somewhere, or have another higher calorie fruit.

teIblDHiaa	Vegetables Highest in Protein (Grams of protein given are based on a 50-calorie serving):    - Seaweed, spirulina, raw (11g)     - Watercress, raw (10g)  - Alfalfa seeds, sprouted, raw (9g)  - Asparagus, cooked (8g)  - Mustard greens, cooked (7g)  - Broccoli Raab, raw (7g)  - Mushrooms, white, raw (7g)  - Spinach, cooked (7g)  - Zucchini squash, raw (7g)  - Turnip greens, cooked (6g)  - Chinese cabbage, cooked (6g)    Hope this helped! =)    EDIT: Actually, I just realized that you would have to eat an insane amount of these veggies to get the protein grams I listed. 50 calories worth of veggies can mean 10 cups of them. For instance, 1 cup of watercress has only 4 calories. So to get 50 calories worth of watercress, you would have to eat 12 and 1/2 cups of it (to get the listed 10 grams of protein)!    Sorry for the misinformation. I would rather recommend that you stick to legumes, nuts, and seeds for your vegetable-based protein sources. I also know that goji berries are surprisingly high in protein, so you might want to try those. But overall, legumes, nuts, seeds, and dairy products are a must for vegetarians in my opinion.|`|AF8meDXOaa	Go for beans, lentils, seeds and nuts.  potato:high in carb,   green leafy veggies high in fiber, vitamins, calcium etc.  legumes (which means beans,lentils etc):high protein along with other stuff  Note: If you are asking that for weight loss purposes (eg: high pro-low carb diet) a warning: you shouldn`t ignore the importance of carbs and shouldn`t cut down so much on sources of carbohydrates, it is very important for healthy metabolism to get enough carbohydrates.|`|AA10241705	Beans are very high in protein.|`|Fl0LwEIZaa	Here is some information that I found online that may help you!!

XHnpraaxaa	Try cooking pork in the slow cooker and it will turn out tender.  I sometimes cook ribs very slow in the over for two or three hours than take them out and turn the heat high and baste the ribs and let them glaze and they are to good.|`|c9adce326b761303adb12127ff5dabd0aa	If you broiled a 1" pork chop for 18 min. of course it did not taste good. Modern pork is very lean and dries out easily. Try pan fried next time. A little oil in the pan. Fry at med. high heat for about 6-7 min. per side. I love pork. Pork is good, very good. It should not need any seasoning other than a little salt and maybe pepper. Just like a good steak.|`|wvIIJKUIaa	ok the trick is to best let it sit in heavily salted water for about an hour...more if possible...after that drain the water...cook the pork in the water at a low temperature for about 2 hours...if u can use vegetable stock or chicken stock if u have it...pork only tastes good when it cooks really slow for a long time..and save the natural juices ...get the natural juices..add a little flour and wine..let it simmer or thicken for about 15 min..and u can use that for a base sauce to go with your pork...ok give me best answer ! lol
llkSmgLJaa	Being a vegetarian isn't a weight loss plan. You can gain weight on even a vegan diet. Cut back on the pasta, and when you do eat pasta use whole wheat pasta. We loose weight the same way meat eaters do, by not eating as much as we burn off in a day.|`|nDOWKhwCaa	Your diet designation has nothing to do with your weight. Your weight has to do with how many calories and carbs you eat and how much you exercise and burn calories. You can get to a healthy weight on a vegetarian, vegan, or omnivorous diet.|`|7xkwE3X9aa	Make sure to eat more veggies and fruits and not more carbs instead of meat. I ate more bread and cheese when I first became vegetarian so I gained weight. You probably could if you dance 2 and a half hours and you eat healthy. I've heard people losing about 15 pounds!|`|4pco9j9Faa	You can lose weight, but you probably won't unless you make a conscious effort to eat healthy. Try eating less of the over-processed food (frozen dinners, fake meat) and more simple carbs, fruits, and veggies. Cut down your portions if you think you are eating too much. Remember to stay healthy, eat a variety of nutritious options.|`|TPn3CEK0aa	Nah, you will gain weight cuz your matabolism will slow down to nothing from not eating proper foods like we are meant too|`|wjEPVNezaa	No.  Some people do it wrong and actually gain weight.    If you want to lose weight, you need to strongly control portion size.  Eat a variety of fruits, veggies, and nuts.  Lots of calcium.  Drink plenty of water.  Don't deprive yourself, but limit bad stuff to three of four bites (diminishing marginal returns on how yummy it is).  Don't eat out.  Don't eat too many canned goods, use frozen instead.|`|asXq2cFDaa	Wow, Ashley actually speaks the truth for once.  O.o  lol, ok back to the question.  I found it easier to lose weight on a vegan diet, personally because when vegan you really have to focus on nutrition and getting healthy, which is the key to loseing weight.  Cut out sweets, eat more veggies. Sounds like your workout is good.|`|6c1tDSqqaa	Well, if you eat way too many pasta's, and full fat cheeses along with desserts (which are not veggie friendly) it can be tricky, but yeah you can lose weight if you omit a food group. Try to get your protein though (beans, for example).
ewUQuX4Kaa	No.  A drink cannot lose alcoholic content unless water or another liquid is added to it. The first poster is a little backwards with the info he gave also... Water will evaporate faster than alcohol, so a drink can actually become stronger with time... Stronger is a relative term, though, as the amount of evaporation will be miniscule, therefore the amount of increase in alcohol would be nearly unnoticeable - and it would have to happen over a LOOOOONG amount of time; a week is nothing, I'm talking a year or more.|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	No, Liquor is ok with the cap off. Now if it is off for an extended period of time (like weeks->months->years) then it might become somewhat less potent. But for a week, it should be ok.|`|kXIRz2jwaa	Go to a bar.

TlA1SmrLaa	the really best way is doing a Bucket. you gotta cut a 1 or 2L bottle in half and need a bucket of water but its the best way still. Really I dont support smoking out of bottles or any of that other sh*t unless its the bucket lol|`|nI6dyZCNaa	well first of all, why are you smoking if you dont even know how to make a homemade bowl?      and second of all, you need tin foil.    make a bowl out of the tin foil to place in the nozzle of the bottle, make sure there are tiny holes in the bottom of the bowl so you can inhale it.    then using a lighter or a sharp tool, poke a hole near the bottom of the bottle for the mouth, and one near the top for the choke.    enjoy|`|dMBXw8Esaa	I'm telling you now that you need to do a gravity bong or "grav". Trust me on this haha. Pretty much what you do is you get a pitcher and fill it probably about 3/4 the way up with water. You get a bottle like a water bottle and cut the bottom off. then you poke a hole in the cap that goes to the water bottle and put your bowl in the hole which I think you can make out of aluminum foil? I'm not exactly sure on that part. Then you put the weed in the bowl, screw the cap on and stick the bottle in the water but not all the way in. You light the weed and slowly lift the bottle out of the water (but not completely out or else the smoke will go out the bottom). When the bottle is filled with smoke, unscrew the cap and suck in the smoke. But as you smoke in, push the bottle down into the water; and when water touches your lips, you're done. This will do the trick :)     OR you could do without the water and just make 2 little holes on the bottom of the bottle. One to cover up and one to suck out of. You do the cap the same way.    I suggest going to youtube and searching. You'll find what you're looking for there.

hCsAHDjNaa	Sleepover. Huge parties are better for older teens.  Junk food is an essential part of sleepovers :)  Pizza, candy, soda. For music, popular dance music, but nothing too vulgar. Put on your local hit music station and it should be all edited  but fun hit songs. You can find cute invitations with a Slumber Party theme at your local party store, WalMart, dollar store, most anywhere. 11 year olds might also have fun doing makeovers and watching Disney Channel. You could rent a movie like Camp Rock (the one with the Jonas Brothers) or High School Musical 3 (I'm not quite sure when that one's coming out on DVD, but its soon.)|`|hV43wyvJaa	http://www.birthdaypartyideas.com/html/p...|`|MwkR695Gaa	well a sleep over is always fun but a huge party would be good if they have guy friends. heres if you decide not to do the sleep over. invitations could be just a note card with the info and stickers on it. for the music i would just download all the newest songs that people seem to like. (disturbia, put a ring on it, just dance, hot and cold.....excetera. for the food it depends on what time they come. if its from lets say 6 to 11 have them eat before they come and just put some meatballs in a crok pot and get some chips and pop. just have it themed for whatever is in season. right now it could be a valentines day party or a winter wonderland party. have it in an open place so people could "get jiggy with it". also have games like catch phrase and twister. other than that they usually entertain themselves|`|ycs7XAnXaa	slumber party totally to pick the food u might want to ask ur friends what kind of food they likethe rest i dont know :) im not 11|`|kpbhTX0Daa	huge party will be great. what kind of party? birthday party or music party with a pool? or just a party. if i just simple will be great. it must have the snack, muffin will be good. pizza, chicken roast with some salad.|`|G4qY6roFaa	How about a home Day Spa birthday party? You can do hair, nails, (maybe too young for makeup?) relaxing massages then layout warm towels for the girls to lay around and gossip, play soothing music, candles. I wouldn't really decorate with streamers or banners - but with spa like items - such as the white fluffy towels, flowers... maybe flower petals leading to the spa room! For party gifts, you can put together a spa bag with items that you use to do the hair, nails, etc. Another great party gift idea is birthday T-shirts from imaginTEE.com - bonus - they glow in the dark - so then you can have a sleepover and you will all glow (literally)!

zn6OVTJHaa	I would highly recommend a slow roasted rack of lamb, lightly seasoned with salt, pepper and a little olive oil. Grilled asparagus would make a nice accompaniment. Sounds delicious!     Definitely wouldn't recommend fish ~pesto has a strong flavor that would overpower the delicate flavor of the fish.     Filet Mignon would be a nice choice too.

It is made of almond paste so if anyone that you hope to enjoy it with you has a nut allergy, you must tell them.  You can make the marzipan the filling between one of the layers or you can use it on top and use the vanilla butter cream frosting as a filling - you could also frost it with the vanilla butter cream and fashion the marzipan into flowers, hearts or leaves to just decorate the top.  I find fondant a bit too sweet but its a fine substitute if you are allergic to nuts.  My wedding cake had rolled fondant, it was too thick and everyone ended up just eating the cake part and tossing the fondant it was covered in.|`|eAobNmUTaa	Vanilla butter cream would be just fine to frost the cake.  Fondant is generally used to coat the cake, serving as a frosting.  It is labor intensive (it must be rolled out thin, and formed onto the cake and smoothed.  In my opinion, fondant is mostly tasteless...but looks beautiful.  Marzipan is great for making ornaments.  If you're all about having a great tasting cake, choose the butter cream.  Good luck!|`|9afcc4dd55438d0d72ec5c22e28c3f8daa	I would suggest buying fondant or marzipan as opposed to making them (unless you're making the marzipan from purchased almond paste)   Fondant has a more bland flavor, marzipan is definitely almonds and is quite rich. Marzipan is light tan and fondant comes white, but both are easy to color, just knead in food color a little at a time until it's the color you want.|`|AA12270223	Fondant is better hands down! it's easier to work with and will go better with the flavor of your cake. Vanilla icing will work just fine. Fondant is pretty...normally marzipan it used under a roll fondant(like a glaze)and not as a finished outside!

Z7RiriL6aa	just go to a organic market and get them. Alot of them have pesticide residue on them and all that great stuff.|`|AA11394813	They still have some nutritional value. It is not just the engineering. Farmers only have to return PKN (phosphorus, potassium, nitrogen) back into the soil to get a plant that LOOKS healthy. Which means over time all of the other nutrients are taken out of the ground with the plant, but not returned to the soil. Organic farmers use crop rotation, animal fertilizer (instead of chemicals) and put the unused portion of the plant (compost) back into the ground. The other thing that happens is that the plants are harvested before they are ripe so that they are less likely to bruise during shipping. The reason that is a problem is that the nutrition is put into the plant as it ripens. Just like putting green tomatoes on your window sill will turn them red, there are other methods of making a food appear vine ripened.|`|8KMdXKTLaa	Yeah they shoot them with hormones to make them grow...BUT that does not take away their nutrition.

rm9mGQBSaa	Eggs are pasteurized in order to kill Salmonella enteritidis, which may be contained within the eggs. That bacteria may cause no more than an upset stomach for most people, but can be life-threatening for small children, the elderly, pregnant women, and anyone with a weak immune system. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) estimates that 2-4,000,000 cases of salmonellosis occur in the U.S. annually...so the situation can get quite out of hand without pasteurization.    As far as precautions the baker should take, the FDA points out refrigerating eggs below 40[degrees]F limits Salmonella growth, and fully cooking eggs destroys the bacteria.|`|s3L88qGQaa	It would probaly be apart of not getting a disese or food poisoning|`|teIblDHiaa	There are no precautions I can give you but to buy organic, free-range eggs from a local farmer who does not engage in animal cruelty. This will ensure that the eggs you are getting are truly healthy. Farm eggs have a substantially lower risk of Salmonella contamination. The risk is pretty low to begin with though...it's a 1 in 1,000 chance. And the chances of getting very sick if you are affected are very low unless you have a weakened immune system or you're a baby or an old person. I eat farm eggs raw all the time and have never had a problem.

Trust me, don't put in molasses or caramel or anything else in. Just use regular white sugar instead. And since you even have a little bit of brown sugar already, I bet it won't make a noticeable difference at all.

AA12031316	If you are willing to take the time to make them homemade, I make a cracker that is super high in protein.  (I also make a high protein shortbread that uses agave nectar to sweeten, so no refined sugar to deal with and plenty of nutrition)  They are pretty fiddly to make, since you have to grind the quinoa flour yourself, but again, they are PACKED with protein and contain none of the preservatives or chemicals in storebought crackers-they are also gluten free, egg free and super yummy.  Email me if you want to be bothered with them, and I will send you the recipe.  All I could recommend otherwise would be some rice crackers (available in the gluten free section of most health food stores)  You might also try rice cakes (brown rice would have more protein)  Cheese has plenty of protein too, but only if its REAL cheese-not those processed slices.  Cabot brand makes a nice, very mild cheddar cheese thats made with vegetarian rennet and is high in protein.  It should be mild enough for your little sweetie!

As long as it's good and chilled, the whipped topping ought to be hard enough to hold 'em up for 2 minutes!|`|f24a4de342b1375dc37e91955d32d1a1aa	It depends. If your top layer is the cake layer and you stick the candles in the cake part, it *might* work. But whipped cream or pastry cream or fruit compote are not stiff enough to hold a candle up.

Put rice in a big bowl and get ready to start frying.    4) Use peanut oil instead of sesame oil, because sesame oil is easy to burn and loose its flavour in high temp. right away!    Directions:    1) You need a real hot stove and a big wok, heat the wok on high heat till you can see smoke coming up (the steam of the air) and that's hot enough to add 3 or 4 tablespoon of cold oil - remember - hot wok + cold oil, season the wok with your spatula.    2) Within a few seconds, you can tell the oil is hot enough, reduce heat to medium or slightly lower (depends on how hot the heat be generated by your stove) pour egg mixture into wok, stir quickly for a few seconds, add rice into wok while the egg are still 30% cooked.    Below is a photo showing you that the egg mixture is cooked too fast in the hot oil and it can't coat the rice anymore (about 85% cooked, I would say)  http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/im...    3) Toss rice and egg mixture to combine quickly to "coat" the rice, keep the wok as hot and if you find the ingredients are too much that the wok isn't hot enough, turn heat to high again, if you think the heat is too hot and part of your rice starts burning, remove the wok to a cold stove and continue to stir fry quickly. Then put the wok back to the hot stove. The action should be quick but organized.    4) Now it is time to add your other cooked ingredients (shrimps / roast pork or ham) to the egg fried rice, add salt to taste, toss to combine, sprinkle green onions. Turn off heat.    5) Sprinkle sesame oil to your rice, toss again till rice is shiny. If you do not want the sesame flavour. You can sprinkle a teaspoon of cooked peanut oil to your fried rice to make it shiny.    Restaurant Style cooking usually use a lot of oil in fried rice, the trick is they add a teaspoon or a tablespoon of cooked oil as the final touch.    Note: You can stir fry the ham and roast pork (cubes) together because they are cooked meat but still you also have to put them on paper towel to drain the oil after you stir fried them, they contain food colouring, I would suggest you to mix them with your fried rice at the very last moment, so that they are hot enough and you can avoid the red food colouring spoiling your beautiful yellow coated rice  ==    Chinese Fried Rice    You'll need:    Half a cooking onion, minced  A couple sprigs of green onion, minced  Cooked shrimp, marinated with:   sesame oil, soy sauce, sugar, salt, garlic powder (or Five-Spice Chinese Blend seasoning)  4 cups cooked long grain jasmine or short grain rice, COLD (this is important!)   1 tbsp of oil  1/2 cup thawed, frozen peas and carrots, well-drained  3 eggs, beaten with some white pepper and salt  To taste: salt, sugar, soy sauce  1/4 cup chopped green onions (scallions)    Utensils:     a non-stick pan or a wok  spatula    DIRECTIONS:  1. Heat up the oil in your wok/non-stick pan - put your stove on the highest heat possible. When it gets pretty hot, throw in your chopped cooking onion, which should be sizzling and the peas and carrots. Stir around with a spatula until the onions are translucent.  2. Throw in your marinated shrimp. Stir around for about 45 seconds.  3. Throw your rice into the pan, and stir that concoction around so there's an even distribution of shrimp and onion.  4. Crack in your eggs, and stir like crazy. The goal is to not have any egg chunks.   5. Put in a tiny pinch of salt and sugar.  6. Pour in some soy sauce, just enough so the rice is sort of a golden brown color. If it's dark brown, you've put in too much. Stir so that rice is an even color throughout.   7. Throw in green onions, toss around so green onion is no longer raw. Serve immediately.

MbSSIOpSaa	YES you can definitely eat spinach uncooked...it's delicious. i love spinach salads with other vegetables and balsamic vineger & olive oil! raw spinach is the healthiest.     YES you can freeze uncooked spinach, but the texture will be different when you thaw it....wet. then you could use it cooked in a marinara sauce for pasta or in a lasagna once you freeze it.     i wouldn't recommend freezing lettuce because there aren't any dishes that use cooked lettuce, and once you freeze it then it would not taste good plain.|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	Yes  Yes  No|`|I5P2bbgWaa	you have to parboil/blanch spinach and drain well before freezing  lettuce you cant freeze  raw spinach is used in salads and on sandwhiches|`|70503cfcfc1323e870ead31c66f98600aa	it would not taste good under cook   no you have to cook it , no|`|wjEPVNezaa	Yes  Maybe - You can't eat it raw, but you can cook with it  No - The water will expand breaking the cell wall so it will not be suitable for eating raw, and I've never heard of any recipes involving cooked lettuce    ETA: well, you COULD eat raw spinach and lettuce after it was frozen, but it won't taste good|`|RJpekNPfaa	Yes, you can eat spinach raw - in salads, in sandwiches and by juicing.    I love raw spinach, I hate cooked spinach.    Baby spinach is best eaten raw, as the leaves are small and soft.    English bunch spinach can be chopped up into small pieces with a sprinkle of lemon juice to make it sofer in a salad.    Yes, you can freeze raw spinach but it is best not to, because it does not thaw well and you are often left with wet mushy spinach. You could use it in a lasagne but not much else.    Yes, you can freeze lettuce but it is best not to, because it does not thaw well and you are often left with wet mushy lettuce. You could use it in a lettuce soup.

70503cfcfc1323e870ead31c66f98600aa	Wednesday|`|yegDdZfRaa	Supermarkets usually cycle their specials every month...one week it's dairy, the next meat, etc.    Keep track of the fliers in your supermarket (if you get them in the mail or pick them up when you go grocery shopping) and keep track of the pattern...also, if you don't have a preferred shopper card for your grocery store, GET ONE. You'll save quite a bit doing that.    A couple months back I picked up a 4 pack of BEAUTIFUL, thick, well-marbled ribeye steaks at Kroger...without my shopper card they would have cost over $40. I paid $14 for them with my shopper card. I still can't believe it.|`|AA12042448	Most grocery store ads start on Wednesday.  Ask at the butcher counter in your local grocery which steaks are good for preparing the way you plan to do them.  Don't buy a slow-cooker steak when you want to grill.|`|OKD0il7Iaa	I go to Walmart for my steak and they put the ones going bad in the next couple days for like half off at 4:00 am if your up then|`|8CPH9l0vaa	Really, since steak is a food enjoyed year round, it doesn't usually go on "sale" per say. The best time to buy a good steak (sirloin, prime rib, kansas city strip) is 2 to 3 days before it expires. Stores like Wal*Mart, Price Chopper, and Kroger put the steaks at a reduced price to get it sold before it expires, because if it doesn't sale, it goes to waste and they lose money on it. These steaks aren't of any less quality than the others, they were just cut from the cow a day or two before those at full price. That is my suggestion... if that doesn't work for you, buying the steaks in bulk can reduce the price, however, it is difficult to buy good steaks like I mentioned before in bulk. Generally they're packaged with a single steak, occasionally two.

Depends on where you are in the country, there are certain shots that are just plain vodka (In the NW, look up Hood River Distillery, and take a shot of that.) For shots that won't make you gag, throw up, give the stupid face, or just plain not have fun with, take a whiskey sour shot (can be well whiskey, and the sour mix will take away the aftertaste), if you go a little further, things like Jaeger and Tequila's (with salt and lime) are easier "party" shots.

9f7c8164ca2d49e24413295051f36abaaa	I LOVE Flat Top Grill! It is one of my favorite restaurants.    You do make your own stir fry but you have options. You put in your veggies, meat, and sauce and then you choose a colored stick. The stick allows you to:  - Get a piece of Indian bread  - Make into a hot & sour soup  - Make into a vegetable soup  - Just stiry fry it  - Make into a salad  - Wrap in mooshu wrappers    The price is 11.99 for one bowl/trip to the bar and 12.99 for multiple trips for dinner. It does not matter how much you put in it. The best bet is to go for lunch which is before 5pm and is 8.99 for unlimited bowls. I believe that the most fancy dessert is $5.99 for this chocolate concotion but I have never had it.    They also have a FABULOUS brunch on weekend mornings which you can put fillilngs and create your own pancakes, waffles, egg scrambles, french toast, or omelets.    I highly recommend it! Sign up for their email club and you will get coupons for a free stir fry during your b-day month, buy one get one coupons, and so forth. They are a great deal and can be used at lunch or dinner.

So here are my suggestions:    Steamed or buttered peas or green beans - easy enough and it's nice and simple, so it won't take away from the main dish.  Also, a nice green veggie that goes well with just about anything.    Roasted Cherry/Grape tomatoes - toss in EVOO, salt and pepper, roast in the oven for 10 - 15 minutes at 400 degrees until they split and get all yummy.  Tomatoes are a nice compliment to cheese in any form and it goes great with an upscale mac and cheese.    Good luck and I hope everything turns out well!|`|uO3FC4draa	steamed broccoli drizzled with crushed garlic sauteed in olive oil|`|eAobNmUTaa	Definitely a simple salad...mixed baby greens with a delicious vinaigrette.

Good luck!|`|78588e3257514586ce18e14f16018f9eaa	"HARICOT VERT"     FRENCH STRING BEANS    2 lbs. fresh string beans    Clean string beans and cut to 2 inches in size.

Can be served either hot or cold - Bon apetite!|`|mMnsplaqaa	Ummmm, a really good spicy seasoned pork loin or pork roast & then of course your green vege.  Depends on where you're from, BBQ ribs or chicken would be good too.  If your mac & cheese is your main course w/meat or not, then I would serve it with some steamed mixed vege's for color & salad & bread, something orange & something green & bread.|`|8lYZROjuaa	Bilini's  Raw fennel and citrus salad.
