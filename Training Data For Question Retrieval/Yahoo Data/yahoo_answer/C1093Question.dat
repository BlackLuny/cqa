20090205125132AA9nYO9	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Question On Tattoos and the Workplace?	OK, I very well understand that in some workforce areas, tattoos must be covered in order to look professional. Well, my question is, what if the person's hand is tattooed and lets just say this person is very qualified to do the job. Is the workplace just not gonna hire the person b/c of the tattoos on that person's hand? B/c I know that some workplaces really are very strict about those sort of things. If they denied that person, wouldn't that be discrimination. I mean, you can't make the person wear gloves all the time-that's just not practical.

20090205125104AAxvLV1	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	L'occitane hand cream?	Do you think it's expensive? I've only used this one brand of hand cream all my life. I'm not really sure how much hand creams should cost.    I was at the mall when I remembered that I needed to get some hand cream, So, I went to sephora to get some. There was a lady behind me and she was like "$25 for a hand cream? What a rip off!" So, I was kinda shocked.    Do you think $25 is a good price for a tube (5.2 fl.oz.) of hand cream, or is it too expensive/cheap?    How much do most hand creams cost?    What brand hand creams are similar to L'Occitane?    Thanks!

I actually liked it, but I want to try now another color, blonde!   If I don't like it I still can get it red or brown again! And I'm young, so I should try crazy things now (I'm 17)!      But the question is.      I talked about this to two friends. Yesterday, I ask one what she thinks and she said "well, why not give it a chance?", but she said the best would be not to get it like totally brown. Maybe a light brown, light caramel or something and if I like it then get it every time a bit lighter. She said so the change wouldn't be strange for me.      Today I talked to another girl I know. But she said to get it all right now blond. The shock would be great and I would have a new style without having to get it step by step.      What do you think?      Thanks for all the help!

20090205142520AAiKqDQ	Beauty & Style;Hair	Bleaching my hair for the first time, help?	I have a dark brown colored hair naturally, I've dyed it black several times over the years and recently I've done it, over 3-4 months ago, most of it has been washed out but it is still there.      I've just took a strand test on my hair, I used Jerome Russells 40 volume peroxide for medium to dark hair.. I left it on for the maximum indicated of 90 minutes.      It certainly lightened it a little, but I'm not sure of how much I need to lighten it to apply my Directions Pillarbox red hair dye.      The color I achieved was like a copper/rust sort of color and I was wondering whether that would be suitable for the red I'm going to use?      If not will I have to strip the black with a color remover and then bleach it?      No stupid remarks, no telling me how bad it is for my hair, how dry it'll make my hair, I've read up about it and know all these factors. I just want a straight answer.      Thanks.

20090205154417AAgcJI8	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	If you tan at tanning salons, please help!?	(I just asked this question, but I got a bunch of rude answers about how I'm really stupid, and how I might as well paint myself orange and shoot cancer into my veins. PLEASE only answer this if you are knowledgeable about tanning in tanning beds, or go to tanning salons yourself. Thanks!)      Here's the question:      Ok, so I go tanning in tanning salons. I noticed that I slightly burned around the core of my body (stomach, hips, butt, etc...) and my arms, face, and legs are only getting slightly darker each time I tan in a bed.       I know it's because your stomach is in the center of the bed, so it gets the most light. Next time I go tanning (tomorrow), I think I'm going to apply some sunscreen to where I got burned so the burn heals and doesn't get worse. However, I NEED SOMETHING THAT WILL TAN MY FACE, ARMS, AND LEGS!       Is there anything (like oil?) that I could apply to my face, arms, and legs tomorrow when I go tanning so they will get tan quicker? Preferably something that I could find at my home and not have to buy.       thanks! =)

Some people say you can tell how much that area will hurt when you get it pierced if you pinch that spot that you want pierced it sorta hard (i did that and to tell the truth i felt zero pain)   but, i mean some people say it feels like a pinch and others say it feels like a stab.

Okay here...outside of school I am very well liked...like my friends from horse riding and polo games, my friends from my volunteer work, my friends from Rotary......but in school I'm so hated (I think..because it shows)  and I would like to be accepted at least if not liked......      Well I've tried to be and I still am trying........at first I tried to be super friendly.......then I tried to be like a mysterious type...then the talkative and funny........then a good boy.....then a bad boy..........and no I am not trying like "obviously trying hard" but in a subtler and humorous manner. Then I realized why don't I just be myself....so I did let things just do it's own thing while I'm being myself....but still I really don't feel likable.        I have close friends but that's it! Not that I hate that but I really want to get to know people better, and don't get me wrong I am not a loner and stuff, I am by far one of the most well known guys in school       but they hate me..very few people say hi to me, they look at me funny, I sometimes here them talking about me like they talk crraaapppppppp about me........then I thought if not for these very close friends of mine I would be always alone in group works(thank God they're always there).........      I just hate the feeling of being hated..and I haven't got a clue why!?         .......................... so what can you suggest me? Change in clothing perhaps? hair style? a new bag? a new life? lol ignore that but what can you suggest?

I have mild eczema, but the problem is, that it has left me with many scars all over my legs and arms and it looks terrible. I absolutely love wearing short sleeved tops and dresses/skirts but for the past few years I've had to hide myself under long sleeved clothes even in the summer :( I've invested in things like bio-oil and shea butter but they don't reduce any of the appearance of my scars. My boyfriend said it's normal and that I should stop hiding. But I can't help but to be paranoid whenever I reveal small sections of my skin with eczema and I feel horrible and dirty.       How do you feel when you see someone on the street wearing a skirt with scarred legs?   How can I possibly get over it?

20090205133558AAb2zRc	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Swollen ear after piercing!?	I got my ears pierced at Claire's 6 weeks ago. This morning I tried taking out one of my earrings to change, but my dad said it was time to go, so I decided to wait until later to change earrings and just put my starters back in. But the earring would go in the front, but not back out the backside of the hole. So during the day I asked other girls who had the ears pierced what to do, and got numerous tips to try when I got home. But by the time I got home, the back of the whole on my ear was kind of grown/scabbed over. I got my sister to put the earring in, and she ended up having to push the earring through the scab/skin on the back. I thought I'd be okay after that, but now my earlobe is swollen! What should I do?

20090205133947AAUxcLV	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	What stores are similar to Hot Topic in Canada?	Where can I find a store that is similar to Hot Topic in Canada? I kept on hearing about it, so I looked it up online, and thought it was awesome!   Preferably somewhere in Ontario, even though other places might do.   I have read a lot of people's answers (Other questions similar to mine), and a lot of people answered West 49, Boat House, places like that. But instead of the skater/punk/band mechandise, I'm looking for the goth merchandise (Hot Topic is goth/emo). There might not even be such a store, but I'd really appreciate it if anyone had any suggestions. Thanks!   Oh, and there's something else that I was just wondering. I've heard of Trivium, a store that is quite similar to Hot Topic, but I'm not exactly sure what it's merchandise is like. Is it basic goth/emo, or fetish goth/emo? 'Cause the clothes looks pretty revealing online, and that's definitely not what I'm looking for.   Thanks!!! :D

20090205125352AAuN4pT	Beauty & Style;Hair	How would I achieve looser curly hair with a curling iron?	I have a huge event tomorrow, and I am planning on curling my hair. I haven't curled my hair myself before (usually my friends did it for me or I just put it in braids and sleep on it) and I borrowed my friend's curling iron. My hair is right where my breasts are, and has a few layers. The curling iron is around an inch and a half with a clamp.   If I just want loose curls on the bottom of my hair, how would I go about curling my hair? Should I start in the middle of my hair or the top? How long should I leave the curler in?? Also, should I wrap my hair tighter, or does it not matter? Should I curl inwards or out? Any advice would be super great! Thank you! :)

Everytime I try to though, they hit a certain length (I'd say around my cheekbones) where they're not short enough or long enough to fall across my face, but rather almost curl to the side, no matter how much I straighten it (and I have a good straightener that goes up to 450 degrees). This exposes my face and not in a nice way. My bangs just look greasy no matter what! I really want to get past this stage because I know once my bangs are long enough they will look great. What can I do in the meantime to either keep my bangs in my face, or how can I style them? I try pulling my hair back into a ponytail but unless I use a headband I have baby hairs that stick out everywhere. Any remedies for that? Because I HATE headbands too.

20090205124357AAoY19A	Beauty & Style;Hair	How can I get rid of yellow & orange hair without going back to the salon for the forth time?	I had natural blonde hair with highlights, I wanted to go medium brown - my stylist dyed my hair super dark brown (darker than most browns I have seen) with neon dark red. Way too dark for me!  The next day I went to the same salon, saw the colorist (my stylist was off) and she dyed my hair a brown blonde with a half head of highlights - my hair turned out light brown red with auburn highlights (it looked very dark strawberry blonde).  Less than a week later I saw my stylist for a consult, discussed going back to blonde working our way to Nordic blonde, one week later (yesterday) I had my first appt.  He did a full head of highlights - now my hair is yellow and lighter orange, not blonde.  It is the most unnatural color I have ever seen, worse than the two prior.  I have spent over 1,100 dollars on my hair at this salon in less than three weeks (cost, products, tips).  What can I do?  I had beautiful hair before, long, healthy (even with years of highlighting) and I was trying to grow my hair out longer.  I never should have changed my color.  I just ordered L'Oreal White Violet shampoo and conditioner to try and help with the yellow and orange.  Is there anything else I can do?  I am so embarassed, I look like a fool, my husband is beyond disappointed - I can't go back to this salon or any other salon right now and spend more money.  Plus, I don't want to destroy my hair anymore than I have.  What can I do about this crap yellow/orange hair disaster?  Please Advise!

Can i get away with wearing them all the time?
