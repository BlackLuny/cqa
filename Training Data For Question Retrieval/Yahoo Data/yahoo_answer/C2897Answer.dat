There was one skeptic who talked about using a machine gun on federal employees, one skeptic yesterday who was slandering public figures, and let's not forget the skeptics continually asking about farts.  We wade through question after question from skeptics in those veins, and answer after answer regurgitating that you all don't like Al Gore or that it is all political or religious, and you're concerned that someone quoting something written by an actual climate scientist will lower the intellectual level of the debate?  Seriously, propagate your eigenvalues out of the j-plane.      So, to answer you, no, I don't think quoting RealClimate debases this forum.|`|UgTHAsISaa	All sources should be cited, whether quoted verbatim or paraphrased.

UgTHAsISaa	Not only is global warming real, but mankind's activities contributed greatly to our recent warming.    A. Since the turn of the last century, the average global temperature has risen by about 0.8C (about 1.4F). Most of this increase has come within the last thirty years. http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs...    B. CO2, methane, water vapor are all greenhouse gases. Over the last ~150 years, the concentration of CO2 has increased by 35%. More greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will means that Earth's surface will become warmer.    C. Most, if not all of this increase in CO2 is the fault of mankind. We know this because of changing ratios of carbon in the atmosphere.[1]    D. Due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the average global temperature is expected to rise by another 1.1 to 6.4C by 2100.[2] The most likely increase will be between 1.7 and 4.4C.     E. If the world warms by another 1.7C, then there is a laundry list of bad effects that will most likely come true. That laundry list includes: more evaporation, and heavier precipitation and severe storms. Heavy precipitation often leads to flooding. And because there is heavy precipitation in one area, the next area over will get less precipitation. This is because the storm clouds have already dropped much of the accumulated water vapor. Inland, droughts are expected to worsen. A 1.7C increase hastens the melting of glaciers and snow pact. Much of the world receives their fresh water from glacier melt. With the glaciers gone, many people will have no drinking water for much of the year... etc. etc....|`|V6dz395kaa	The earth is getting warmer each year and ice caps are melting, and polar bears are dying. :( hope it helps!|`|S7KseEgNaa	Global warming or Global cooling terms are better classified as "Earth Change". No one know what will ultimately happen. But the truth is that mankind's activity cannot affect Earth's change. Deep beneath the surface of the Earth are many plates that move every micro-second. It is the movement of plates that cause earthquakes, volcano eruptions, and other changes. Mankind's activities cause air and water pollution, but not Earth change. Not to worry! My best guess is that all the organic stuff on this planet will ultimately become fossil fuel in about 2 million years.|`|5nlvsiIHaa	From what I have researched. It is a direct affect of the added pollutants  from  world wide industrial corporations. Along with they emissions from the out dated combustion motors, burning of fossil fuels. Along with the suspected,  additives that Create air craft com trails. Forest fires and volcanic irruptions also can significantly increase this phenomena.  This increase in the resulting cloud coverage, traps the suns rays from escaping, resulting in record profits for those that have invested in sun screen. The once baron waste land of  Antarctica now becomes the most sought after controversial new frontier, yet to be formally molested and exploited, by the very same corporate conglomerations that self appoint their self's the rightful owners of all species of life and resources on this planet.        At the same time they withhold  technology's that should have improved on the condition of life. Animal as well humans.  Hoping that we don't WAKE UP and realize our spiritual connection to nature and the meaning and value of our creator endowed inherent human birth right.|`|G9VBTg47aa	Fake.|`|0eFSeap5aa	It's a hoax.

Beyond that it is the illusion used by people to puff up their heads to compensate for the lack of talent and skill commensurate to their egos.|`|pbVPS24zaa	Global warming is the increase of greenhouse gases caused by pollution and what not. There is a huge hole (the size of North America) in the ozone layer above Antarctica. The ozone layer is there to prevent 80% of the sun's DAMAGING rays to reach the surface. So, in this case there is that huge hole that is melting the ice caps and killing the polar bears. Not as good as an explanation but I answered :)|`|2vtP7WS7aa	I know that humanity's one second of fame(and counting) in the Earth's existence is insufficient to affect Climate in any meaningful way and that Scientists  can only see "through a mirror darkly" and freely admit so.  The relationship between carbon emissions and climate is debatable.  The Data used to justify AGW is highly suspect.  Not only due to its limitations but to outright manipulation. Some of the key supporters of the AGW theory openly admit that overplaying the disaster scenarios to help the cause is acceptible to achieve change.  At least 650 Climantologists, the ones brave enough to handle the onslaught of Ad hominum attacks and peer rejections, have proclaimed AGW  "a media generated hoax,"  the same opinion as John Coleman, the founder of the Weather Channel.  From the reports on the melting of the polar caps, I have read a lot of "maybes",   possibles" and " We don't fully understands" used to "debunk" Dr Roy Spencers research.  It rivals religious persecution on the professional level, the article even mention's him by name.  Some scientists have pointed out that the climate has been cooling since 1998.  Either way Science is blind unless they have at least 1500 years of non disputable measurements to justified AGW's claims and frankly neither time ,nor attitude is on their side.|`|d12a585a9f486535d07b0683ef24b00eaa	Fraud Hoax  hi-jinx.|`|hXwX8dwsaa	People in Kentucky would be glad to give you an answer if you go door to door and ask them.

Laws forcing things down peoples throats generally do not work and lead to rebellion. There was a case a few years ago where all toilet tanks had to be a certain size. People were actually buying larger retrofit tanks for their new toilets. Michigan passed a law many years ago requiring a deposit on all bottles and cans. Beer and pop sales in boarder areas of Ohio, Indiana and Wisconsin went through the roof while Michigan sales in those areas fell like a rock. There are still areas of Michigan that are littered with out of state cans.

Anyone with any knowledge of history knows that leftists are selfserving, short-sighted, rather dull intellectually and have been poor decision makers.    Those who support the left are generally followers, not thinkers.  They have a hard time understanding the real world, history, science or how the planet works.  Theirs is a blind, disciplined world that requires strict compliance.    Being on the right, on the other hand, requires actual thought process, something that's sadly lacking today.  Conservatives are more focused in reality, question things before accepting them, can even be skeptical of current trends.  So I'm glad not to be part of the leftist ideology, who for the most part don't understand or care about the long term ramifications of their actions.  This includes the global warming zealots and their current fads.  But this is the change they're demanding of everyone.|`|f64a2a4ada0fcb1ea5303362c0bca8efaa	What they mean is that we have to change it to the romanticized illusions of how great society was before we started massive scale industrialization.|`|99735a22fbfaab5561850052bda71db5aa	They are an unquantified way that "activists" can push the responsibility for resolving this "crisis" onto everyone else.  They still can't say for sure that we are actually seeing a warming trend.  We've only kept weather records for about the last 100 years, and by any standard, that is a tiny sliver of time from the planet's perspective.  Don't worry, there are plenty of people out there who haven't lost their common sense.  The activists are small in number, and we have a million other more pressing problems to deal with as a nation.

People HAVE to stop thinking that WE are forcing YOU to do something that will only benefit US - YOU are not living in a seperate  environment from ME are you? No, you're not - WE ALL are in this TOGETHER.  It's not like we're asking you to wear a certain pair of shoes or hat or haircut - THIS IS OUR LIVES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT!

For instance, we'll get away from modern subdivision houses that are uninhabitable if you don't run HVAC rated above 7 tons.

Choosing to drive a car is not an expression of freedom, it is an expression of privilege.  You have the basic freedom to travel wherever you wish, whenever you wish.  To do so by a personal automobile is a privilege, and it is that loss of privilege, and the loss of status most skeptics feel it imparts to their lives, to which they object.      Most people who advocate realistic measures to control CO2 do not advocate the loss of basic freedoms.  They do however mutter that some of the privileges we enjoy in the industrial world (e.g., meat at least twice a day seven days a week, driving everywhere is a car, air travel for convenience and leisure) should be restricted, or perhaps not abused so wantonly (e.g., flying across the country for a weekend party).      You probably won't like this answer, but you should ask yourself: Does owning a large house, huge car, and having access to enough food to eat myself into Type II diabetes really make me free?  Or does it make me an eloi, except I don't even have the purpose in life of being food for the morlocks?      So, no, dealing with climate change won't override the critical choices and freedoms.  But then most people don't really want freedom, they just want a nice comfy chair to watch TV, and plenty of snacks.|`|vfubWXFMaa	What it really means is that us low class peons will need to restrict our lifestyles to what they deem appropriate to the local commissars decisions.

The houses here are all old, probably built in the late 1800's.    Every roof except those that are empty for the winter have huge icicles hanging off them.    Icicles mean heat is escaping through the roof and melting the snow.   If they'd put some insulation in the attic they would save enough heating oil to pay for the insulation in a couple years.    The town hauls hundreds of truckloads of snow 15 miles out of town after every storm.   There is plenty of room for them to dump it on empty city land right in town, or even dump it in parking lots of stores that shut down for the winter.    The state department of human services building leaves their computers on at all times.   Figure about 300W/hr. is wasted on each computer.   At 25c/kWh delivered that's almost 5kWh and $1.20 a day wasted.    Multiply that times thousands of state computers 365 days a year and it adds up.   The temperature is kept at 70 all the time too.    A pprogrammable thermostat would save millions and cut down on fuel oil use at the same time.

To get there, we have to quit adding CO2, and start taking it out of the atmosphere.
