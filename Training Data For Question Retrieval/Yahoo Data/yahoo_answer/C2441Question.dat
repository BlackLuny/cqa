20090222163458AAcXGwt	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Why is it 'Team Switzerland'?	I've read the Twilight books and do not enjoy them, but this is something that is really annoying to me. Switzerland is referring to neutrality which Bella is defiantly not. She wants BOTH Jacob and Edward. Team Switzerland makes no sense. She's not neutral, she's just greedy. Does anyone care to explain why Switzerland was chosen to be a team name?

20090222175000AAw4nGs	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Has anyone noticed this about the Warriors cats books?	I've noticed so many grammatical errors in the Warriors books by Erin Hunter.  Like, "Even medicine cats must learn enough fighting technique to be useful in battle."  Another example I found was the book calling Tawnypelt "Tawnypaw", after she was a warrior.  In the Firestar's Quest book, Petal was called "Petalnose" before she actually became a part of SkyClan.  I've found even more little errors here and there.      Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the Warriors books.  But I find it strange that they are so poorly edited.  It can get kind of confusing.        Has anyone else noticed this?

I thought I might discuss the way he switches from making calls for action, to simply writing as if Walden is a diary, to speaking as a mystic of a sort.      How would I phrase this? Would I call it "three narrative voices in Walden"? Or is there a better literary term for this?

20090222174544AA2Bx6l	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do u like my book so far?	i just got bored one day so i wanted to right this anyway:      Ch.1   Okay, This is just a dream, when I wake up I'll be fine and be in California again,   I thought to myself. But it wasn't a dream, I'm millions of miles away from sunny San Diego just because of my dad's job. It's not like I'm not happy for my dad, I'm actually really glad that he found a new job that pays way more than a clerk. Now he's the manager of Macy's(or is it Nordstrom's). But the thing is I'd rather be in San Diego than "freeze your socks off" Wisconsin.Right now I wish some genie would grant me three wishes:      1. To move back to San Diego,   2. Be with my 2 best friends, Cassie and Kelly.    3. And that my mother never died.      Well, those are my wishes, wish number two and three are  the ones I really wish would come true.I really don't like talking about wish number three, but I'll tell you about it.You see my mom died two months ago from a car crash, I can still remember the event like it just happened. One Saturday morning, my mom was going to get some school supplies for me, I didn't want to go so I just gave her the list.That was the last time I spoke to her, and the last kiss she gave me on my forehead.When it was around two o' clock I went upstairs to tell my dad that mom wasn't home yet. He called her cell phone. No answer. Then I heard those loud knocks on the door I would never forget.The police was here. They were telling my dad and I that my mother died from a car crash.She was on her way home when a reckless drunk driver crashed into her blue SUV. I cried so hard that night, that the next morning my eyes were so red and swollen a four year old would be frightened of me.So that was when my dad decided that we should move to Wisconsin.He didn't like living in a house that had so many happy memories of my mother. Cassie and Kelly were there for me through all the tough times, and I miss them and my mother so much. So here I am, in my new bedroom looking out the foggy windows and forcing myself to get up.All around me were unpacked boxes full of my stuffed animals and cheap clothes from Target.                                 So what do you think?

Those memories lie under my bed,   As pictures and writings   In an square yellow box,   With two yellow carnations on the front.      It has been passed down through generations   From my great-great-Grandmother.   Every time I look at the pictures,   They remind me of the good times.      Like the first time I rode a horse,   Bareback, through the pasture   Hanging tightly to her mane,   Praying I would not fall off.      And when I was three,   My Grandpa pulling me   In my red metal wagon.   I wonder if he knows how much I miss him.

20090222215317AAiPKWB	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	How does one go about proving one's own Proof?	It may be a semantic distinction, but I just thought about this while rethinking my Desk Test Narratvie.  In Chemical Sciences, they prove the interaction of certain solutions being mixed by taking those two solutions and pouring them together in Reality.  In forensics, they prove their theories by performing similar-event experiments in shooting-range labs.  But in philosophy, we prove our theories by using commonly accepted rules of logic to establish a reality in which that theory should be true (or false).  In order for the proof to be accepted, the Rules of Logic which support it must be accepted first.  So, is that how to defeat Solipsism?      If not, then how does one go about proving that Solipsism is the case?  As improbable as it sounds to be able to disprove it, the question now seems to be reversed:  How can it be proven?

20090222223539AAmDt3k	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Painting	Should China develop its own modern art scene instead of copying the West's?	China's fine art development (painting) was arrested back in the 1950's.  China was not allowed to freely develop its own art scene until quite recently; even now, there may sometimes be some restrictions.  Should China start its own modern art sensibility by immediately starting to copy from the West, at the place where the West has currently developed to, or should it ignore the Western developments that have taken place during their squelching and simply pick up where they left off back in the 1950's, thus creating their own natural development with their own culture?

Sorry to sound negative, but personally it sounds like this isn't worth near what they ask, judging by above links. I attended JRP classes, wish I hadn't spent all that money, and have "WON" the audition to attend IPOP, which is not the "once in a lifetime" thing like they make it out to be, after I made the first audition 4 or 5 years ago I was told that any time in the future that I could get up the money I could attend the event w/o auditioning again, and truthfully I felt the audition I performed for the IPOP thing was my worst to date, however they felt it was "out of this world." I've also heard that just about all high-level casting directors will automatically scrap you from an audition list if you list JRP or IPOP on your resume, they don't have a good rep w/ the talent world. Tonight, on a SUNDAY night they called again to see if I could come in to talk about attending IPOP, I wondered why they did this on a Sunday night until I realized it was the night of the Academy Awards, coincidence?  It sounds like there are decent opportunities that "could" come from it, but with all the sketchy things like only JRP students that have paid thousands for classes can attend, it doesn't sound like it would be worth the $10K at ALL.  Any success stories that resulted from IPOP?  (please no JRP affiliate responses that flood these types of questions everywhere)

Our family is going through hard times, but she has a book published and very much wants to get it sold. I'm trying now to help her get it sold because I want to help her accomplish her dream. She has many other books written and me and my boyfriend illustrate but she needs money to publish those too. Please, if you're interested in purchasing and reading a wonderful, creative children's book answer. The book is called "Uh-Oh, My Foogle Flopped!"

20090222191746AAVQe1H	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you like my story so far?	I ran.    I didn’t know why and I didn’t know where I was running to.    It felt like I was running for my life. Running to save myself.    I couldn’t remember what had happened. Why I was so scared. Why I kept running. I tried. I tried so hard to think of what happened hours before. Or days.    I slowed.    There was a steam ahead of me. I knelt beside it.    I saw my reflection. I saw the tears in my eyes and the sweat on my face.     I saw the blood on my shirt.    I got dizzy. I laid down. I put my head on a cold rock.     I felt the ground wobble underneath me.     Before I knew it I was drenched. I heard raindrops crash against the ground. Then I up again. Running.    I ran over the river.    It reminded me of a song that I would sing when my mother took me to Grandma Lucy’s house: Over the river and through the woods, to grandmother’s house we go.    I looked up. I saw a house. Grandma Lucy’s house?    I walked up to the door and walked in.     There was a petite women sitting on the couch.    She looked up. “Jeff,” she yelled. “Jeff!”    A man ran in. Muscular. Thin. Handsome. Just like...    The room went out of focus. The ground snuck out from under me. I was falling. Into the never ending darkness.

If twilight and most of the first twilight books were published from 2005-07.... why is it all such a Fad at this current time? Was it because of the movie or Breaking Dawn realization? Or what then? I know it wasn't given so much attention when the first books came out back about 4 years ago, but it is now. Why?      I LOVE the books and all ... but i don't get it.      I know how it all goes though. Its always the same. Something gets released and gets given very little attention, then something else becomes released and turns it into a new Fad over time. How was it with Twilight?

20090222223905AA7JlhM	Arts & Humanities;Genealogy	What time frame do most white southerners trace their immigrant descendants from?	Was it during the 1700's? The early 1800's? The entire nineteenth century? It's harder to distinguish within the more inland southern states, because many people from colonial states, and Louisiana, migrated to states like Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi in the early 1800's. In Louisana's circumstance, I know most French and Cajun ancestry, was there prior to France selling it to the U.S., in 1803. Although less common, yet more popular in Lousiana, like Italians, Polish and Jews I'm aware came later in the late 1800's/early 1990's.      It's hard to find a dry cut answer on this one. I've found a time frame of when Scots-Irish came, which was mostly in between 1717-1770. They had a large impact on southern culture, especially the accent, but I've noticed, from looking at the Census, that other ethnic groups, like German, English, Irish and Scottish all out number them, in most parts of the south.   The way I figured it, if Congress banned the slave trade in 1808, and most African-Americans trace roots to the south, and mostly have English, Scottish, Irish, and French surnames, the people who would have had to have given them those names would have had to been living there at the time. The slave trade was at it's highest peak during the mid-1700's. I don't know for sure if this is a reliable way of looking at it though, although I'd have to imagine a certain amount of man power would have been necessary to keep that large evil institution powerful.

ALSO do not suggest Harry Potter, not because it's not good, but because I've read it ;]      ALSO do not suggest a series of unfortunate events - i really hate sad books, and I've already read them anyway.

20090222230808AAnVHbM	Arts & Humanities;Genealogy	How authentic are family coats of arms obtained from the internet?	I have done a little bit of online research on my family name and found a family crest.  The same crest appeared on more than one website.  If it is an authentic crest, that originated in Europe at least 100 years ago, I might be interested in obtaining a copy of it for display.  However my family is not noble or royal as far as I know.      I am not pretentious enough to want a coat of arms simply because someone else has one, but if there is an authentic coat of arms I would like my family to be able to display it.  The coat of arms I have seen could have been designed using a web design or photoshop program. and I don't want something that was created simply to separate me from a few hard-earned dollars.      Any experts out there on family heraldry who can advise me on this?  I don't NEED a coat of arms, but if there is an authentic one I would like to add it to our family's historical documents.      The graphic products advertised are not expensive, but would be too expensive if they don't accurately represent me or my family.      Thanks.
20090222231624AAqokRe	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Can someone critique this very short piece of writing?

Thank you!      Secrets      "Come on please tell me the big secret.  Tomorrow we will have been dating for two years, and you still refuse to tell me!" Brooke looked up still leaning against her boyfriends chest, a spot that had grown quite comfortable over the years.      Brandon sighed and looked out at the beach front condominium they had purchased almost a year ago.  Fierce waves threatened to crash against the window, but Brandon watched calmly as he stroked his girlfriends long bleach blonde dyed hair.      "I told you, it's not something you want to know."      "Have you been cheating on me?" Brooke challenged.      "Of course not.  You already asked that."      "Do you have a kid that I don't know about? Little Brandon Junior?"      "No," Brandon chuckled.      "Well then tell me already!" Brooke persisted, her blue eyes sparkling with curiousity.      "Look, tomorrow there will be plenty of surprises in store.  I'm going to be...romantic," Brandon gagged,  "The secret can wait until another time, can't it?"      Brooke knew what a hassle it was for him to get a day off from work, and how much effort he probably put into tomorrow even though he thought romance was for cheeseballs and saps.  She considered letting it go, but being the business girl that she was, she decided to bargain.      "Yes, and that other time can be after our lovely day tomorrow.  What do you say?"      Brandon placed his hand under his chin, resembling the The Thinker sculpture by Auguste Rodin as he pondered deeply.      "Fine," he agreed reluctantly.  He figured by now he should be able to tell Brooke anything.  This relationship afterall was his longest in the twenty four years he'd been alive.  She would accept the secret and the relationship would only grow stronger.  So why was it so hard to tell her?      "I love you," Brooke yawned and stood up from the sofa, interupting Brandon's thoughts.  "Are you coming to bed soon?"        "I'm going to go downstairs to the gym.  I'll be up in a little bit."      "Alright," Brooke replied a little sadly, then head slowly down the hallway into their bedroom.      Blocking out the desolate tone in her voice, Brandon rushed down the three flights of stairs to the condominium gym not even bothering to change out of his flip flops.  He figured he wouldn't need running shoes, all he wanted to do was lift weights.  Maybe that would get rid of the nervousness, and the shame of the secret.      He wasn't surprised when he found the gym empty since it was eleven o' clock in the evening.  He picked up sixty pound dumbells in each hand, lay flat on the weight lifting bench and closed his eyes as he brought his arms straight above his head.  Over and over again he persisted, and when it began to strain his muscles he only went faster, feeling the pain in the center of his chest.  He tried over and over to lift it out, but it stayed.  He couldn't forget about it, no matter how many drugs he had done in the past, they hadn't wiped the memory away.      "It's over," he reminded himself as he grunted his way through several more sets.  "It was forever ago.  When I tell her she'll just laugh it off, quit stressing about it man."      Unable to do anymore lifts, he dropped the weights with a loud thud, and sat up out of breath.  He looked down to see that his hands were trembling and squeezed them together loudly cracking his bones.  In his mind he could see himself taking off on his motorcycle and getting the hell away without any explanation.        Not knowing where he'd be going would be better than having to see the look on her face once the words came out of his mouth.   No, he wouldn't leave like he normally did with girls.  This time he would open up like all of his friends had been urging him too.  This time he wouldn't keep her out, two years was too long to throw away.

20090222225918AAjuMnF	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Can some one help me find some poetic devices in this poem?	Facing It    by Yusef Komunyakaa          My black face fades,    hiding inside the black granite.    I said I wouldn't,    dammit: No tears.    I'm stone. I'm flesh.    My clouded reflection eyes me    like a bird of prey, the profile of night    slanted against morning. I turn    this way—the stone lets me go.    I turn that way—I'm inside    the Vietnam Veterans Memorial    again, depending on the light    to make a difference.    I go down the 58,022 names,    half-expecting to find    my own in letters like smoke.    I touch the name Andrew Johnson;    I see the booby trap's white flash.    Names shimmer on a woman's blouse    but when she walks away    the names stay on the wall.    Brushstrokes flash, a red bird's    wings cutting across my stare.    The sky. A plane in the sky.    A white vet's image floats    closer to me, then his pale eyes    look through mine. I'm a window.    He's lost his right arm    inside the stone. In the black mirror    a woman’s trying to erase names:    No, she's brushing a boy's hair.

I believe there is  NO god - people are the creation of mere genetic happenstance.    Humans are horrible to each other - greed and over-indulgence run rampant, and the dollar trumps human decency all too often, not to mention the atrocity of how money lords over logical sustainability practices.    So, why live?    What hope is there for a better world?   If all there is to life is consumption and production, why do it?

How can you do these things and me still not be able to get you out of my head.      Why do I still live every minute of everyday thinking of what I could have done different.      And why do i still get butterflies when you look at me with those amazing eyes.      And when you smile that perfect smile, why do I still melt inside.      And why do I still long to kiss you one last time.      To have your arms squezzing me close to your heart.      Please tell me why you had to break my heart.      And what  this feeling inside of me that wont go away is. No matter what I do I still have feelings for you.      I can feel my heart break everytime i see your face.      But yet I STILL LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!

Standing soullessly   Through daylight and brass weeds   Imaged as grace   She’s seeking more than a dream      A scarce veil   Hiding her Ivory toned skin   And wondering eyes   Lays regretted in the dust of dawn      Streams of dream-water call to her   Hushing her pain   Awakening her heart   Revealing rose-filled cheeks   Finally free      Clouds of white wrap around her   Pressing her necklace into the sand   Burying her pain      Nightfall comes and goes      Seeking her love in the sea   Finding her misery      She walks to a stone wall   Remembering the fond-ness of his eyes   And the day they disappeared      Pass the bitter taste of hate   She enters her kingdom   Expecting one day to be with him      Beckoning her enemies to her side   Unbearable   She froze in her tracks   For all to see      Raising a dagger   Lined with vain mistakes      Before she could pass   Merely alive   She felt the embrace of his eyes   Opening her heart      Flashing back to a veil laying in the dirt   And a necklace in the sand   The red hair beauty smiled in the face of death

20070801175732AABM0vr	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Cómo sue?as cuando sue?as...?	CON LOS OJOS CERRADOS            Afuera hay luna blanca y hace frío   y el reloj en mi pulso hace las diez.   Nadie vendrá para el momento de cerrar los ojos,   y quizás al dormir, nadie estará conmigo…   Versos huérfanos descocerán mi almohada   y el juez de la ilusión, ese tan loco   me los dará otra vez para la guarda…   Pero so?ar no sue?o cuando duermo,   prefiero ese poder muy afuera de la almohada.   Sería injusto que sue?e un “yo te quiero”   con los ojos cerrados si mis versos te aman…   Una vez más el fantasma pasionario   me atesora el corazón   y sin piedad como si fuera un ogro   lo vuelve solitario…   A veces pienso que vendrás por aquí   y que por coincidencia de cari?os   te quedarás a dormir aquí a mi lado.   Otras, siento que un viento polar   te borra irremediablemente del camino.   De todos modos soy feliz   te tenga o no te tenga.   Porque lo que me hace estar contigo   es justamente lo que a ti te impide   que te vengas conmigo.   Melancolía de una noche que le dicen   cuando uno sin querer   se ha tomado una copa más de vino.   Y luego va a su cuarto como un duende   y como un arlequín estrafalario   cierra los ojos y se queda dormido…   y si quieres saber al día siguiente   si te he so?ado,   te digo una vez más que no,   ?no me gusta so?arte   con los ojos cerrados!…      Adan (d.r. 2007)

Alright, so I have a project where I have gone back in time to a village in England in the year 528. We get to decide what ideas, developments, etc. we want to introduce to the village. In short, I want to find or invent something that in the end would make my village very, very wealthy. For example, I was thinking of sending people to discover all the gold in California, but considering I'm in England, that's too ridiculous.      So is there any other place gold or any other valuable material was found in history? Was there any discovery that made those involved very wealthy?
