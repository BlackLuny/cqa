I have been flyiing as an unaccompanied minor using the British airways skyfliers solo thing where you sit in a room and a lady escorts you to your flight (same thing happens at the other end). I have been doing that since I was 11. I'm now 14 and I want to be able to go through to the departures and onto my flight as if I was a normal passenger without being escorted by a BA staff member.   Does anyone know what is the age you can start doing this?   PS my flights are 7 hours long so I don't know if it depends on the flight time? Some people say you can go by yourself at 12, others say 14, others say 16 and other people say 18. Which one is correct because the BA website doesn't tell you and I am bored of going to sit in that boring room and would rather go through and eat or shop.

I would be landing at Peshawer airport and then going to Mardan where my bf's family lives. Are they really far away from each other?

Should I try and bike(and possibly get run over) or get an extremely cheap car that will probably break down on me?
