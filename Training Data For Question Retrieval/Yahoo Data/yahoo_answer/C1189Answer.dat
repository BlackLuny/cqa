e22c69d9c930e30e0d8bcfc48f81dd6faa	Firstly - YES.    For the love of God, YES.    He has TOLD you he loves you.    HE'S TOLD YOU!    Boys don't play with a girl's hair, look into their eyes and tell them they love them...UNLESS THEY LOVE YOU.    How the hell haven't you realised that yet?!    Secondly - of course he hasn't asked you out since. HE TOLD YOU HE LOVED YOU...and then you didn't believe him!    Stop being blind and ask him out, he's so unlikely to ask you out a second time now because you totally blanked him the first time he asked you out.    Oh no wait...he didn't ask you out...he went further than that...HE SAID HE LOVES YOU.    Are you getting it yet?    You're going to have to make the next move, ask him if he wants to see a film or something. You may even have to make the next move after that and hold his hand in the cinema first - you've really missed a good chance here.    Oh, and did I mention that he actually said the words 'I LOVE YOU' to you?    What other signs do you possibly need?|`|qXqm50T6aa	HOW CAN you say "love" if you arent even going out    i mean maybe he loves you as a friend...but its tooooooo soon to say that|`|Kg7xwi5Yaa	i know you're coming here hoping for advice but honestly, none of us can tell you if he loves you or not. yes, i can tell you he seems to be interested in you and likes you...but i can't tell you whether or not he has such intense feelings for you as loving you...the only person who could ever tell you the truth on whether he does or not is himself. if you want to be with him, you should be straight up with him and flat out ask him if he meant it...if he says he did and seems sincere then don't hold back, tell him your feelings and then at the end of it ask him where that puts you two or if that makes you two more than just friends.     good luck girl!|`|eDP3YU5Laa	yeah probably does :)  good luck|`|NGHdmQwoaa	yes i do think he meant it because he keeps touching you (sorry not in a wrong way) and he's always talking to you and trying to be with u and trying to get your attention the best thing to do is probably ASK him.  http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...  and u need to stop posting questions and then saying its in   the wrong section because its annoying lol :p|`|Po8TFa4haa	YOU. ask.

70SMyx7Iaa	in the past couple of years used prom dresses haven't been selling to well since places like davids bridal and other mass producers have been able to make a line of brand new prom dresses for $100 and under =[    since animal prints are in this year you might not see much intrest it in  but with how the economy is right now you might still get a few offers if the price is right    i think you could sell this for $100 because it is a pretty color and in good shape  when advertising make sure to sell the point that this was bought X years ago so no other girl should have the same dress  get better full length pics of the dress to post on the website so they can get a better idea of how it looks  and show the matching shawl    can you sew?  if so also advertise free alterations to make sure the fit is perfect for the girl    start the price at around $135 that way you have made room to bargin but the price isn't so hight that it the dress would get completely ignored      best wishes and good luck!|`|WRbbpRZzaa	I wouldn't wear that dress if YOU payed ME.|`|d1d16f976ab4af78c06d3dc29088aab7aa	Honestly, you wont get more than like $20 for it.|`|L4RAKdbSaa	more than 200. since its used and i am soo sorryy!!|`|ZMVs9bGxaa	i would get it for somewhere around 200  good luck and god bless|`|cloASB6paa	I'd pay about $30-50 for it.

W50zzBQoaa	up-dos:    *one up do i always do is i back comb my hair and comb over it making it really messy and hairspray it making sure the back combing isnt showing. then i pin up my band in a poof with a cute hair clip. then i use a hair accesorie like this:  http://www.global-b2b-network.com/direct...   and then pull my hair up in a loose messy bun type thing and hold it up with a clip that looks like one of the clips in the picture! :] its is extremely cute!!!! and then maybe pull ou a few layered hairs around the bun bangs top of your head to make it look messier. and to do more maybe pull two pieces of hair down by the sides of your face and curl them. and try to make sure the hair do looks volumized and then hairspray everything when your done.      *Another hair cute hair style is if you have a 3 barrel iron ( an iron that crimps your hair) then crimp your hair in random places not really tight crimps or alot of crimps on the top of your head and kind crimp your hair. make sure the crimps are loose not reaalllyy crimmpp if you know what i mean. ( NOT LIKE HEYYY I REALLY TRIED TO CRIMP MY HAIR TODAY AND IT LOOKS ALL STIFF) nice and loose to make it look messy and cute. then back comb your hair on top and in the back a bit. comb over the back combing so you cant see it and then push the top fo your hair up with bobbi pins to make it look volumized. and then put your hair in a low, loose pony tail. hair spray it when done.  THIS IS ALSOO A SUUUPPPPER CUTE HAIRSTYLE! :] :]      * another up do thats always cute and easy is to do a realy high ghetto pony tail. with a lot of bumps and reallt messy. then wear a really cute head band. i love that too!    these hair styles are all really really really cute ! and casual but make you look really pretty.    another tip is when you do updos make you eyes look really pretty and focus a lot on your eyes. thats what i always do :]|`|L2pkns9maa	Use a straightener with gel and hair spray... should do the trick nicely|`|7N2YPjkEaa	low side pony.... i always do that but only certain ppl loook good with it, ppl with layers and side bangs mostly|`|bYXs9VeOaa	A high pony tail with bangs to the side...or curls and tease it|`|QMLjVAMWaa	Use the Pantine hydrating shampoo and conditioner, and blow dry it straight. if there are still waves or curls in it, or if it is just frizzy, take some lotion (doesn't even have to be for hair) and put a little in your hand and put it in your hair from the neck down. Then if you want, you can straighten it with a hair straightener.  you can also get a new hairstyle that will work with your hair.|`|pOKdvur0aa	Okay braid your hair wet before you go to bed. Apply lots of mouse and hairspray, then go to bed. When you wake up take out the braids and apply more mouse and hairspray even if they are everywhere then play with your hair until it calms down. When that's done, you can either leave it like that, or put it up in a messy bun, it's a beautiful style. No way you'll look "proper" hun!

I don't think your legs are bulky or overly muscular.  In fact I probably wouldn't use "muscular" to describe you at all.  A more appropriate word would be toned.      Enjoy them while you've got them and don't spend too much more time looking for approval or being insecure.  It's a waste of energy.    On a side note, that room you're standing in is a pig-pen.|`|e7uUfLsqaa	they look great :)|`|f481ueRQaa	no they are thin. not bulky|`|OLyKEracaa	your legs are very pretty, very good shape.  maybe need a tan?  you look pale with the black dress.|`|AA12097239	You've beautiful legs, not too thin, not thick at all... perfect.

I am always pressured into as what my body looks like. Being said i am 5'2 and 128 lbs. But just don't feel insecure or self conciouse about what your body looks like. I've spent the majority of my high school and teen years feeling like i wasn't "shapely" enough. And trust me, that really takes a toll on a person's self-esteem which can cause you to become depressed or even make you gain weight. You then start to feel like you can't wear certain clothing, or you always look in the mirror and go "grr" but love your body for what it is and show confidence because in the end that adds a lot to the way you look.|`|1a2rHhnqaa	You have nothing to be worried about, they are perfectly gorgeous legs.  I'm sure your friend was genuine in her flattery so don't be insecure!|`|bb06GQ5Paa	They look nice from the back.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	Your best bet is to find a picture of this shaggy cut and show it to your hairdresser, asking them to replicate it on your head. Here are some pics to browse through:    http://mensfashion.about.com/od/goomingh...  http://mensfashion.about.com/od/celebrit...    Curly hair care:  Right after you get out of the shower put a little conditioner back into your hair, until it feels like wet silk. Then scrunch some gel (LA Looks sport gel is good) into your hair with your hands. Scrunch some of the water out with a t-shirt, and let it air dry without messing with it. If your hair is crunchy once it has dried, just scrunch out the texture with a little aloe vera gel for defined, healthy curls.    I hope this helps! :)

oFIU6xOQaa	okay first off, its okay if you hair falls out in the shower its normal,   it might be the shampoo, it might not. the only shampoo i know of that makes hair fall out even more is Pantene,   however i DO know, that your not supposed to brush your hair when its wet, when your hair is wet, your hair pore/follicle things open, making it easier for your hair to fall out.|`|mqlzkJ54aa	Hair loss can be caused by lots of things.

That stuff can stick to your scalp and cause skin problems.  Switch shampoos and see if that helps.  Are you wearing a hat all the time?  Sometimes winter hats can make hair fall out by making not allowing the scalp to breathe.  The dry heat of central heating systems can dry out the scalp and cause hair to fall.  If your scalp is very dry then try head and shoulders dry scalp shampoo.  I tried it when my scalp got all itchy from the dry air and it worked. If switching shampoos doesn't work, then a trip to the doctor would be in order. Unexplainable hair loss can be an early warning of several medical problems, such as vitamin deficiency, thyroid problems or a skin condition.

AA10236815	it worked for me! i do suggest that you get it, it's been the best product i've found to get rid of acne without irritating or drying out your face. You will need to use a moisturizer after the treatment lotion and you can use one from the Artistry Essentials line or one that you get somewhere else is fine too. just make sure that the moisturizer you get is oil free and non-comedogenic (won't clog your pores). If you still have any questions feel free to send me a message!     Oh and don't forget about the satisfaction guarantee! You have 6 months to use the products and if you don't like them you can return them and get your money back!     http://aorihuela.qbeautyzone.com|`|EXWpMIZJaa	I little more detail would be nice!

They are really really really bad for your skin, especially if you have a fair complexion. Spray tans and self-tanners usually look unnatural and orange. You need to use a lotion that builds up a tan over the course of a week. Try Jergen's Natural Glow. It will give you a pretty tan/glow, without the orange look. There's also Jergen's Natural Glow EXPRESS, which works even faster.     If you use these lotions regularly, I can guarantee that you will see a difference in your skin. Good luck, hope this helps!

Help?  http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|RUvQtskcaa	that girl in the link is really ugly. and she looks like a *****. most of my friends are really pretty and they are all nice. they go to church, do charity and are even cheerleaders. some "beauties" are mean and bitchy but not the ones i know    actually, most of them have low self esteem. my best friend is gorgeous! all the guys stumble over her looks and she even has a great personality to match. but her self esteem is very low and she hates herself so ya|`|rrMYRLpXaa	Don't stereotype them...not all girls that say that they're "beautiful" are horrible on the inside.    Anyways, what's wrong with having some self confidence? You're confusing confidence and arrogance here. I think that I'm "beautiful" in my own way! Do you think that I'm conceited?|`|392052a3dbd6d94cc65100310f44fccfaa	First of all,she's an average girl.I don't see what's so freakin' pretty about her.There are thousands of other girls like her out there,multiplied "examples" of her.lol  Being pretty means you've got face features that are uncommon,not REGULAR,not plain,not average. So,pretty,in her case,it's a too strong of a word.    Secondly,you should NOT,but should NOT generalize like that.I know PLENTY of pretty girls who have a nice personality and are not b*tches.Ok,"plenty" more like,let's say,about 7,8.....And i've met a good number of pretty girls all along my life and most of them were nice girls.Being a snob and a b*tch should be an exception.And IS.I don't know what kinda girls you wander around in your entourage....All the c*cky  girls who're stuck up themselves and think they're all that that i've known are slutty average chicks,by no means pretty in the real meaning of it.But that's THEIR problem,they've got issues.Most of the real life pretty girls do not dwell on the thought that they're pretty.They know it,but they don't make a fuss out of it.They're most likely to be humble about it,because,well,when you grow up with people telling you you're pretty,you get used to it  and  after a while you're not even aware of the fact that you are the way you are and look.Those c*cky girls who think they're all that just because they're convinced that they're the sh*t,are very insecure girls.And they've got no real self-esteem and are fishing for compliments in every human out there.They feel the need to be reassured all the time and they'll do anything to reassure themselves that they are "pretty" by doing stuff like :stealing boyfriends,hitting on and flirting with everyone who has two balls and a d*ck,act snobby and all that.They'll do anything to earn their status of "hot female",because they know it for themselves that they're not really that hot at all.Insecurity,baby,insecurity.I know specimen like these,so i know what i'm talking about.They're not worth even a glance.So,don't feel threatened by her,if you show you're confident and you do not see her as a threat(chin up and don't give her the time of the day),then she'll go mind herself else where.Oh,there are so many things i've got to say on this one...lol|`|4e2gb3BQaa	they are either kidding or conceited|`|4zUSUEW4aa	ha she isnt pretty  but people call themselves  beautiful because they are over confident  ahahha    ox|`|n9MOzshiaa	everyone is beautiful in their own way. but not all girls who are pretty are snobs. u r true, a lot of them are, but just because a girl is beautiful don't automatically think they are mean because of wat they look like.|`|HvxKb4gIaa	no. not all of them are like that. everyone is different. and you probably know a lot of girls that are like that cause "birds of a feather flock together!"    as for people calling themselves beauties, i think it's fine as long as it's in a confident way and it doesn't get to their head. like some days i'll see myself in the mirror and think, "aww i look cute today!" and some days, everything is horrible. hahaha.

You may want to do this at night so it has time to dry too, but take it out when its still slightly damp so that you don't get the scrunchy marks in your hair (thats why you do it loose too).

pfBmyQsQaa	Mayo works really well. I've used it before and it strengthens your hair and makes it very shiney.  People will be razzle dazzled by your hair. Just out mayo in your hair for about fifteen minutes, it works better if your up and around instead of just sitting there. Then take a shower and rinse and continue with your regualr routine. Use about once every two or three weeks.|`|Lf3IoQ1Caa	i heard mayonnaise works really good but i dont kno ive never tried it it sounds really gross|`|88aab67b8f8f9204a8c653c60f437085aa	Egg is a good protein strengthener for the hair.

OI3bf4yjaa	Use antibacterial soap (liquid is the best) and a warm wash cloth and clean the discharge and crust. Do this about twice a day, but don't clean it about a million times because it could get irritated and become very infected. Do not use rubbing alcohol on your piercings! Some shops that do piercings suggest that you use rubbing alcohol - but it 's really a big no-no! Both rubbing alcohol AND peroxide kill the healing tissue - therefore it increases the chance of infection. Try not to touch it, move it, bump into it , etc. Wait until it is fully healed once you change it into a bellybutton ring.    Good luck|`|C156l7vWaa	one word: antiseptic! keep it clean, clean it at least twice a day!|`|A46UYUNNaa	wow um... maybe put some rubbing alcohol around it or something... look it up on the internet... lol sorry.|`|GrtqaUInaa	read mates dates and mad mistakes  they get their bellybuttons pierced|`|gQ63jsihaa	Though it' is never a good idea to self pierce, a possible solution would be using a saline solution. You can make it by taking 1/3 cup of sea salt and mixing it with a cup of water and spraying the piercing twice a day or simply pour the solution in a shot glass and hold it over the area. I've had problems with mine though I got it pierced professionally but this seemed to help me.|`|a7qKKlY7aa	keep it clean use like that earing cleaner you can buy at clairs or hydrogen peroxide clean it twice a day|`|b33baa8c5b91e18f1ca0620f6f2d47e2aa	the best thing you can do is keep it clean with like alcohol  and stuff like that just a dab and don't play with it|`|AKnC6ZRwaa	i want to do that but i know i will get in so much trouble.

GOOD LUCK!    xoxo  madison|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Now why would you do that? It is bad to do things that you aren't meant to do. When you get your belly button pierced you have to clean it every hour when you first get it and then when you did it was the needle cleaned or did you burn it to get rid of the germs. Also did you clean your skin before you did it. Because it can get infected. The other side of my niece's family pierced her ears and when she came home (here in Missouri, we have shared custody) it was bleeding and leaking clear fluids. Never do piercings by yourself and did you ever think when it got infected your parents will have to take you to the doctors so they will find out anyways. Considering the fact you are under the age of 18 because your parents can't tell you no otherwise, you can't take yourself to the doctor. I think the moral here is think before you act.|`|gDHsx5I3aa	Hey there. Make sure you have round hoop-type jewelry in your belly button because that will help you clean it better.  You can use a sea salt/water solution to clean it, there is a recipe on this webpage http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Salt_s... You can also use anti-bacterial soap but it is better to use the sea salt soak.  Make sure you rinse your piercing with regular water after you clean it with salt water or anti-bacterial soap.  Clean it twice a day    To hide it from your parents the only way is to just wear long shirts so that when you have your hands in the air your shirt won't lift up above your hips and show your belly.    It might be painful to switch to regular belly button jewelry because ears are pierced at a smaller gague (the thickness of the post) than are belly buttons.  But it is better to have a bigger gague for your belly button because it won't get ripped out (which can happen if you have an earring in).    If you clean it twice a day then it is unlikely to get infected. Just make sure you rinse it well.|`|1y1c5QWHaa	Hydrogen peroxide is great, and so is that stuff you get at Claire's... I forget what it's called, and make sure you clean it at least once a day, preferebly twice, but not too often, or it could get infected. You need to get a real belly button ring ASAP.   Long shirts will work great from keeping this from your parents.    -??T? ???? ???T? ???!!!|`|3qUA5V3Saa	First piercing your own body parts is stupid and dangerous! You are lucky you haven't done any serious damage to yourself never mind getting blood poisoning or it going septic. You need to get an egg cup or a small sterilised tumbler. Boil some water in the kettle and put it in to the egg cup with salt. let it cool down and press the egg cup against your belly so the piercing is covered and leave it there for a few minutes. Get a Q tip/cotton bud and dip it in the salty water and clean the entrance and exit holes. You need to do this first thing in the morning and last thing at night. Also if you pierced it yourself have you got the correct kind of bar in it? You need a stainless steal bar suitable for piercing, not an ear ring or anything that would go in your ears.|`|hml9tgWQaa	DON'T USE HYDROGEN PEROXIDE or rubbing alcohol or bactine all of these are to stringent and will cause scaring.    DO: wash it daily with anti-bacterial soap and do a warm saltwater soak daily    as for hiding it from your parents, keep your shirt on ;)    I hope that helped if not try this website:    http://www.wikihow.com/Keep-Your-Navel-P...|`|MBC3KzCNaa	Firstly, I wouldn't recommend doing that again, really high chance of it becoming infected.   Change it to a proper bar as quickly as possible. Then wash twice a day with a salt water solution. Make this by mixing rock salt with pre-boiled water and wash around the piercing with this. Tea tree oil is also good with healing.|`|l3JQ4VTeaa	omg putting a earing in it is the stupidist thing ur gonna do Ive pierced my belly also but my tip is   use a belly ring  clean twice a day (9 n 3 am and pm)  and also clean ur belly ging   and dont bump it or anything

W50zzBQoaa	idk it depends on if your like prep, or scene i mean whatever your preference is. personally i think scene guys are the sexiest thin ever so if your hair long then go to a salon and get it layered like really choppy around the face, start straightening it, and maybe color it brown if your hairs blonde or black, or Blonde if your hairs brown etc. Its reallllllly hot and NOOOOOO its no GAY when guys straighten their hair. but you don't have to straighten your hair if you don't want to or need to. this hairstyles do sentot necessarily come off scene either unless you go the whole scene look goin.    pictures:    http://media.photobucket.com/image/scene...    http://media.photobucket.com/image/scene...    OR    if you prefer more like preppy hair styles and if your hairs shorter you could always spike it. i dont really prefer it on guys though    sorry couldn'tnt find a pic for this one      you could always do fo-hawk or mo-hawk    Mohawkk is a shorter less attention grabbing    and mo-hakws are generally pretty big from 1-3 feet long ha so i wouldnt do that :]    HOPE I HELPED!!!!!!!!!!|`|cweT8Phpaa	You should have told me your facial features. ?

C0HZ8ZB4aa	[why did your last question get deleted? :s glad you asked it again - i spent aaages typing this answer haha only to find i couldnt submit it - fortunately i copied and pasted!]    I haven't had a wrist tattoo, but I hear they're one of the more painful areas of the arm. However I've had a lot of very painful tattoos over bone on my back and shoulders, and the worst thing about the pain is the duration. A tattoo like that would only take a matter of minutes, so it really will not be that bad. The first few minutes are fine, it's when the needle's been going over and over the same place for hours on end that it's agony. I'm a huge wimp with tattoo pain and dread going in for the ones I know are going to hurt but when I inevitably get my wrists done, the thought of that doesn't worry me too much.    I know some people get tattoos like that in white, however white ink does not do very well over time and has a tendency to go yellow or grey and fades a lot. I would get it in black, I think it would look best, but before you get it, place a comfortable standard sized watch on your wrist, and make sure that the tattoo is placed under the strap and doesn't exceed the width of it, so in your career you can cover it easily.    All tattoos fade with age. With a tattoo on any place of the body, it is recommendable to get it touched up every decade or so. So many people walk around with blurry, faded tattoos, and obviously don't realise that they require maintenance and refreshing. Keep it well moisturised, and when it does inevitabley start to fade a little over the years, have it touched up before it gets too blurry - a tattoo of that size won't be too much hassle or too expensive to get redone.    And okay here is where I'm going to be a bore. I think it's a great tattoo and something I would like myself. However I really don't agree with getting tattoos underage. I don't mean to sound patronising, but a teenager is just not in a position to know what s/he'll want for the rest of their life. I think of some of the things I almost got as a teen, certain I'd want it forever, and shudder, very glad I chickened out! Especially with it being in such a visible place, to you and others, I would wait. I know how frustrating that is, I set myself even now of waiting a few months in between having a design and getting it inked, and I hate it! But you have a very long life and will get lots of enjoyment out of the tattoo, there is no need to rush. And after having waited that period of time, if you still want it when you're legal and ready then it's a good bet that you won't regret it. A lot of people I know who had tattoos underage ended up regretting it and getting them covered over, but with the wrist being such a small area it would be very difficult to get covered over with something small and you'd see it every day. Just be sensible and wait, you'll appreciate it so much more when you do get it, you won't have to worry about being bollocked by the parents, and you can be safe in the knowledge that you'll love it forever by then. Good luck and have fun, I think it's a great design!|`|yuIb3XwPaa	It would definitely hurt and I think black would still be the best color i mean its your talent not your appearance.|`|eFaYMmuraa	It's okay|`|wSq80V1xaa	1) No Idea  2) Black  3) No Idea    And I really like the tattoo.|`|ss48BEk5aa	Wrist doesn't hurt too bad at all. there was only a tiny portion of mine that actually made me cringe a little, and it was over in like 30 seconds. I'd say go for black!. You wear gloves most of the time in the medical field so it won't matter! haha And if not you can wear a watch to cover it...|`|kCdISEGqaa	I think it looks great!  I like it in black, not sure how it would look in any other color.  Like any other tattoo, they fade, but, keep in mind, inks and machines are a lot better now, and tattoos hold their colors a lot better as our skin ages.  The pain, it's bad, but, it's not unbearable.  My wrists were some of the most sensitive areas I've had tattooed.  I go from collarbone to wrists on both arms, and have some work on the top of my back (that was pretty bad).  The wrists hurt worse the closer you get to the fold at the beginning of your palm, above that, it's more tolerable.  The pain is worth it in the end!!!  If you are worried about your career, I caution you to wait until you've established yourself in a position.  My spouse is a teacher and has wrist tattoos that are visible, and no one has ever said anything about it.  Granted they're medical alert tattoos for health conditions, but, no one has a problem with them.  Good luck and have fun with it!!!|`|QnSKaBcjaa	i like it alot! yes wrist hurts. i have a small star and i havent had to get it touched up yet, but the one your getting is black and a bit thicker sso it may fade a little. its not very professional but i wear a cuff bracelet and it covers mine|`|9gEYdLKZaa	That is a really sensitive part of the body, Filling in is the worst of it all.I have a Chinese symbol in that area and it did hurt a good bit. I had it removed for professional purposes and that was the worst pain of my life make sure you want it 10 years from now too.|`|MBC3KzCNaa	I don't personally have a tattoo (yet) but many of my friends do. They have all said that the pain is very much bareable and feels like a repetitive scratch.   Black would probably look best and some businesses have strict rules on tattoos, I'd prehaps research this before making a decision.  I don't think wrist tattoos fade a lot more than any other tattoo like feet, you'll probably have to get it re-colored a few times in your life but most tattoos require this to keep them looking their best.   So that you don't regret it I'd recommend waiting this time to make sure you still like the idea, there's no need to rush people will still be tattooing in two years but if you don't like the idea in 2 years your stuck with it forever.|`|MsgcwacFaa	Getting a tattoo on your wrist is usually frowned upon by the powers that be.   Yes it will probably hurt but if the pain was too unbearable there would be a lot less people with tattoos in the world.   When you do your residency it is usually frowned upon b/c it does not look professional. Why not get it in a place that is hidden to the world?    If you are going to be a pediatrician you also have to think about your patients and their parents; some parents may think twice b/c their kids might say will my Dr. has one I want one too.   I got a tattoo when I was 16 and I regret it now b/c I am no longer that same person that I was back then.    Anyway good luck with your decision|`|LBHJaqXoaa	1. It can get to be a little intense that close to the hand, but your tattoo is small and should only take a few minutes to do. It's bearable.    2. I would get it in maroon so it looks like a henna tattoo. That way you won't have to worry about it in your professional life. And it's small, you could always wear a watch over it. Most doctors wear watches anyways.     3. Wrist tattoos age gracefully. I've only had mine a couple of years, and it still looks as bright and crisp as the day I got it.     Any other suggestions? YES! Make sure the shop is clean and that it has papers from the health department properly displayed for you to see. Ask to see the autoclave - its where they sterilize everything that's not disposable. Shop around for your artist, don't just get the first one you see. Make sure you look at portfolios and find someone with a style you like.     Now, as to the problem of approaching your parents about it. The best way is to be honest, have several good reasons why you want it, and be prepared for them to say no the first few times you bring it up. The key is to not cry, stomp, throw a fit in any way shape or form. This will show them that you are mature enough to decide if you want a tattoo. I would ask for it for my birthday or something, that way they have a harder time saying no. Good luck to you, hope it all works out because it would make a cute tattoo!|`|9VaWal2Daa	I'm sorry........I ain't digging it.     I'm all for tat's....but that just doesn't strike me as something particularly I'd wanna see if I were taking my kid to a doctor.......some line of Arabic scrawled across their wrist.     Other people won't know it's just your name , and it could convey the wrong message.  People judge.    No, it's not fair.......but they do it anyway.     I also don't think it's a particulary nice spot for a tat.     just personal choice and opinion, but you asked.     All tats fade.....over time.......some hold up better than others, depending on the professionalism of the original job.     I've yet to meet the parent who sez.......Oh wow! Cool idea! yeah, let me drive ya down to the tattoo parlor, so ya can mark up your body.!!!    so yeah, I'd expect a bit of opposition........unless your parents are both covered in tats, and think their little baby is ready for her first tat, and are so proud!    (does that actually ever happen? )     and one last personal introspection here.......why do you want your own name, tattooed on your wrist?     Just wondering..........|`|0VBESmFQaa	Not a lot of detail here for us,First off if it is your first i would not run out and get one on the bottom of your food,Chest piece,Back piece,Ribs, and a few other places,If you are worried in may effect your job then get it some where that can not be seen by the public (after all tattoos should be personal and not for looks) and as far as what color to get the artist can better help you because every ones skin is different,What looks good color wise on me may look bad on you, But i am assuming you are a girl so so talk to the artist about light colors such as light purple or light pink or maybe even a yellow.I hope this helps
3yacqUltaa	I agree with your friends- you seem vintage. What gives it away is the button down front shirts, paper boy caps and bell bottoms. You don't seem goth-you are allowed to like dark colors without being goth. Don't be offended by me calling you vintage, it's actually a style that I wish I could pull off, because it makes you seem unique! Hope this helps!|`|CFU77qCbaa	Whoa you're cool!

Ii0PpO8naa	I just asked a similar question yesterday.  I can't tell you how it worked for me yet, because I just ordered it last night...but I'm hoping it works well!  My face has been out of control lately.    It's a subscription like Proactive.  They automatically send you a refill every two months and bill you at the same time.  There is somewhere on the website that explains this, I'll try to find it for you.  You can cancel at any time by either calling or emailing their customer service.    EDIT: here is the site, try clicking on Returns & Exchanges for more information.    http://www.skinid.com/econsumer/clearski...|`|aAHVsJEvaa	I thought it was great. It cleared my acne so fast. Better than Proactiv or anything else. I have combination skin. I have all types of acne. I used to get it everywhere in huge breakouts all at one time - it was bad. I broke out about once a day, too. I wore a lot of makeup to cover it up. And it looked good. I also prespired a lot. My number was 07, 32, 38. I love it. It helped me break out of my shell and really face the world, thanks to my clear, confident new skin.  Hope I helped.You can probably just call to cancel it, although I don't see why you'd want to...

2OBP8fqJaa	They are right, don't pick it!  Get some sensitive skin lotion so you don't sting where you have been picking. Then try a pumice bar to rub some of the dead skin off after you have soaked in the tub, or in a footbath. If you pick, it will eventually pull to to the raw flesh and you will regret it every step you take.     If you have flaps of skin that are dead and dry you can snip that off, if they aren't covering a raw spot. But it will feel a little lumpy when you step since there might be a slight ridge where you snipped the end and the good flesh begins. It will heal.  It may be athletes foot, so if it persists, look into some medicine for that.  Take care hope you feel better soon!|`|7KDL9Wo3aa	Definitely use lotion, and try not to peel it because that will make it worse.|`|uKBJniEKaa	It's winter-dry skin.

Then wrap your feet in saran wrap and put on socks and leave for at least an hour, you can also leave on over night. When you remove the saran wrap rub in completely. You may have to repeat this. Also buy one of those dry skin shavers designed for feet. Trust me this worked wonders for me leaving my feet so soft.

Dh5CUjmkaa	Carmex is not a good product, it is for cold sores. I would use a good chapstick. And keep it with you at all times. You need to re-apply often especially if you are outside. Mary Kay has a line called satin lips which has a wonderful lip scrub and a lip balm. The scrub takes all of the dead skin off so the new skin underneath can come out. I usually use blistex, but not all chapsticks work the same for everyone.|`|FklngtvCaa	lip balm! i like:  - vaseline  - rosebud salve  - lip smackers  - blistex  - the body shop|`|ofCRTXw9aa	Vaseline work great on moisturizing lips.|`|nqkXE1cUaa	You can buy any carmex or chapstick products at the store for about ninety nine cents  Also you can:    Use balms made with beeswax, cocoa butter or petroleum jelly or beeswax for chapped lips several times a day. Make sure that you avoid balms with ingredients such as camphor or phenol which are actually irritants that will dry, chapped lips even worse.    Eat foods which are high in magnesium, calcium and omega 3 which aid in circulation and hydration of body tissues. Foods that should be added to your diet include dairy products, beans, grains and fresh water fish. Nuts and soy are also great choices.    Begin taking a daily multivitamin, as chronic dry and chapped lips are often caused by a vitamin deficiency. Be aware that if chapped lips are due to lack of vitamins, it could take several weeks to see results.    Drink at least one 8 ounce glass of water for every 50 lbs. of body weight each day to ensure that your body is fully hydrated. Additionally, sipping hot water or herbal non-caffeinated tea throughout the day helps to stimulate the circulatory system and draw moisture into the body's tissues.    Be aware of items which dry your lips, such as caffeine, alcohol, sun, wind and lip balms with flavors which cause you to lick your lips.    Keep a humidifier running in your home, not just to get rid of chapped lips but to improve the quality of your hair, skin and nails as well.

Some will require a solvent to remove them. See if there is anything about removing it on the glue container. You may find additional help if you Google the make/brand.|`|Zyzydg4daa	Soak your fingers in water for a while. Then you can slowly pull them off.|`|DskzIKhnaa	beauty supply stores carry a nail glue removing product. its about $3.99  it will losen off the glue first.  anything else will hurt.    if all else fails, a salon will get it off.|`|bOn6sKNIaa	Soak the area in nail polish remover.

kdMM7OAaaa	omg ur just like me. go to a salon tho because they now the right amount to cut out- remember thick hair is healthier than thin hair tho|`|Wnbq4Klmaa	u can straighten it.|`|036UU02Caa	use a layering razor. any stylist will know what your talking about. good luck.|`|MU3EbXHGaa	your hairdresser can "thin out" your hair if you ask them
rgNP0Qo6aa	Okay... science answer:    You grow in at least 80% of your hair during puberty. When you have laser hair removal the hairs it kills will never grow again. But you still have up to 20% of your normal thickness that will grow in throughout the rest of your life. So people get touch up sessions every 3-5 years after their big 6 treatments. You need about 6 treatments, one each 2 months for a year, because the hair grows in different stages and it can only kill hair in the active growth stage. The laser works by targeting dark color (the hair follicle) and passing through light color (the skin) the hair and skin have to be very different shades of color for the hair to work. The darker and coarser the hair and lighter the skin, the better results you will have.    Okay... Personal Experience:    I've had 2 out of my 6 treatments so far. It HURTS! It's like being poked with a sewing needle over and over, but it's not as painful as a tattoo, and that's not as painful as childbirth, maybe that can put the pain in perspective for you =) I've had my legs, underarms, and bikini area done. When you get your bikini area done they do ALL of it! Including spreading your butt and vaginal lips apart to laser all the cracks... It's sorta awkward. After the 2 treatments I've had so far I've lost about 60% of leg hair, 40% bikini hair, and 25% underarms hair. It's because the underarms hair is the thinnest and the leg hair is the coarsest. But the legs are the most painful. The more it hurts the better it works.  I spent this much for 6 treatments in each area:  Bikini-$750  Underarms-$750  Legs (toes to bikini)-$2,500    Email me if you have any more questions about it!

UByvC54Xaa	You just wanna help me get points dont you?!?! I love you!!! Just joking. I suppose I better answer your question..... why should i stop now huh?    The ones in the piccy are not dreads. they are african braids. You would have to go to a salon specialising in braids. Dont think you could do these yourself. Have seen pictures of caucasians with braids - can look alright. Dont know much about them though.    Tomorrow, can you ask a hard question for me? Please!!!! pretty please!!!!! I like these little quests you give me.|`|DlMsJPwUaa	some salons do them but it will not look good|`|uJB3Yet6aa	nobody looks good in dreadlocks...  nobody  NOBODY    especially white people  gross|`|cweT8Phpaa	If you live where I was born you could get them from the store anytime! LoL Maybe try print the picture and ask the hairdressers to make custom made dreadlocks, or they will get 'em from a store out of town. Bit pricey. Get a dreadlock Rastafarian wig? Good luck anyway!!|`|fsHgUrcAaa	On straight hair, that look will be very difficult to acheive.  You might be able to get some sort of curly perm and then try and start your locs but even then as it grows out, it will look ridiculous.  I do locs currently but only on African-textured hair.  I've heard of white people back-combing their hair but I still don't think you'd be able to acheive that look. Your best bet would be to get much bigger locs than that and maintain them by twisting and backcombing.  Sorry I couldn't give you a better answer.|`|QLrZsWTCaa	Honestly, I think dreadlocks are amazing. Love the rasta look, I'm sure you could pull it off. As for places to get something like that done I'm at a loss. I live waaay up north so, seeing dreads are something outlandish =/ sadly.

gFRDHjHeaa	well you must have a very small school...neither of you are very attractive and you both look like trash....honest :)|`|ZjpVlm9Gaa	If you think you're too good for your boyfriend because of your looks, then you should break up.

The people at your school are right.  But your boyfriend is heka cute. You guys make a good couple.  They are prolly just jealous lol.|`|TB12kOefaa	Why do your friend think you're too good for him? NO ONE  is "too good" for anyone.   And if you really do love him as much as you say you do, then you shouldn't allow people to influence you decision.  And, no one on here can tell you if you guys "make a good couple" or not, because a relationship isn't suppose to be based on only the physical. If he's good to you, everything seems compatible, and you love him, then do the math, babe.|`|uJB3Yet6aa	honestly  i think that if you think that way about yourself you dont deserve him  that is a very conceided way of looking at things  its not like you are some super model, and hes not ugly  and it does not matter about looks any way  i seriously dont like you

W91X0Lfvaa	Limewire itself doesn't cause viruses, but if you download a file that has a virus in it then yes, that will cause them.      When you download a file from limewire it will usually warn you if the file could have a virus. But I recommend always using a virus scanner to scan the folder where all your downloads go before you open or play anything and that way you can catch anything that has a virus and get rid of it before it infects your computer.|`|HnjGS9z4aa	use this site called downloads.nl its realy easy no software to download jus straight up free music|`|KNf6B6wIaa	i used it. and no viruses so far    it usually warns you if a file is corrupt or has extensions on it|`|CFU77qCbaa	Yeah. My best friend's sister downloaded it, her computer or laptob, I forget, it got like all messed up.|`|pxEoQ1IWaa	First off, if everyone did this, what if you had an actual fashion question but it couldn't be answered because these types of questions were clogging everything up? Secondly, the huge number of exclamation points are not necessary. You could have made your question longer with actual words. Thirdly, Limewire is illegal to use, but I don't think it causes viruses.|`|ZTpGUIDoaa	yeah, my friend used it her whole computer crashed =[|`|ELy7NK0Eaa	Yes, it does. My computer got a virus from it, and half of the time the songs don't even upload to iTunes right, if thats how you were gonna do it. Don't even download it, it will cause too much trouble.

4qwu50hjaa	blonde, dirty blonde and light brown a bit of everything. like miley cyrus....|`|W50zzBQoaa	its has like four colors in it theres like auburn,brown,blonde,and caramel.    i think if you have dark brown hair, maybe even just normal brown hair it would look lighter then you think it will and if you have lighter hair visversesa i think it will look darker in you hair then you think it will.    but if you have that hair style where you havemultiplel colors in it like brownHaitir with blonde and red foils or streaks it would work. it would even work with plain brown blonde or whatever color hair but it will clash in some way. unless thats what you want.    I THINK ITS REALLY CUTE TOO BY THE WAY :]|`|oUd9ZIDLaa	you could get that in YAcky hair it would be a number 5 :)

If you feel that you have something going for you, DON'T hide it. If you have a quality which you are proud of, find a way to show it off. If you're good at art, draw a picture and leave it out on your desk where a guy you like will have a chance to see it. If you're good at writing, write some articles for a school paper. If you're good at sports, join a team. The possibilities are endless! Never be afraid to show off your good qualities; chances are, the best guys are looking for more than a pretty face.|`|vFsQZL5Faa	a lot of opinions/impressions are based on your looks.  From the sounds of it, you don't have to worry about that.  Being smart or whatever you choose to classify it as is sexy.  Only a moron won't see that.  Don't be silly, you can have your cake and eat it too.  Make it your game, let the rest be the players.  The winner is always YOU!!!!!!!!  Comes from experience...Keep your chin up, if no one realizes it today, they might tomorrow.|`|7f8EVUn5aa	ah that sounds like it really sucks! :/    as an "in between" girl, i've really never been in your position.. though i hate not having a lot of guys around me all the time, my friends don't judge at all so i'm free to be myself 100%.    if you're already popular, why don't you try to ease into expressing yourself more.  Don't suddenly show up at school totally non-conformist or like really different in anyway, obviously.  If you and a group of your friends are having a conversation, try to approach it more intellectually. it might take them aback, but just smile and make it look like being smart is way better than being ditzy.    With guys, if you can see them outside of school and outside of your "group", it's best.  If you go on a date with one guy just one on one, you can let him know what you're really like without having the pressure of having your other friends around to judge or anything.    Make sure that if your dating someone, you let them know who you are and what you're all about kinda right away.  My one friend blends in with the popular kids and she was dating this guy.  A month into it, she broke up with him and came crying to us because he tried to get her to go to bed with him and she was so upset cos she's just not that kind of girl.    always be yourself!  i swear, it's hard sometimes.. but it is so liberating and so worth it.|`|Cvp2WRcsaa	If you want guys to like you, you should really consider being yourself. You say you hide who you are and act not-so-smart. My guy friends tell me things all the time about girls like you--- they're all like "Dude she's so hot but shes a total loser." They say this because of one thing- The girl will pretend to be stupid. This may work with guys when they're talking to you, but behind you're back you don't know what they'll say. Guys like girls who can listen to jokes, understand them, and occasionally give a sarcastic answer. It may seem like you need to hide yourself, but it sounds like you have the whole package--- If you're smart and pretty, whats not to love? Be yourself--- one day you'll look back and see how silly you were being acting like an airhead. And to answer your question, if you're a good friend, and you're nice to people that you don't HAVE to be nice to (people who you don't feel like you have to impress) then people will remember you as being that cute sweetheart that everyone loved.

6YL7yWfxaa	Pair those with a flashy collared shirt. Roll the sleeves up so that they cover a two-thrids of your arm. This shows a casual side, yet looks smart. Try to use a tie that contrasts the shirt you are wearing, or don't use a tie at all. Dark colored vans and a nice belt would look great with the outfit. Get ready to impress people. =]    Hope I helped,  ?Meg|`|3yacqUltaa	Probably collared and a tie. It looks edgier that way. Without the tie, you wouldn't really be standing out--it would just be black and white. Also, do you have red shoes? It would bring out the tie's color and just bring more color in general to the outfit. Hope this helps!|`|CFU77qCbaa	Wear Tuxedo pants. And a collar thing shirt that is white.

uM9vh4X3aa	It's all about how comfortable you look in your own style. Your outfit does sound very dark though - try some colours to lift your complexion - as a progression from black, a navy blue or khaki or burgundy (red wine colour - this colour in particular will look v v good with your hair colour!) tee shirt looks good on most guys, as long as it fits nicely, not too tight but tight enough to define your chest. Some good quality indigo straight cut (not skinny) jeans are always a winner. A black leather belt, or if you're a bit strapped for cash, get a black canvas belt from an army surplus store - they're the same as sold in skate stores - is another wardrobe essential for guys (nothing kinky intended!) . Converse is a good choice of casual footwear, as long as they're in good condition, but opt for black/dark brown leather loafers for going out to parties. Tailored shirt and jeans and loafers is the simplest and best outfit for attracting ladies on a night out! Ties are best kept in the office. Some women don't like jewellery on men, but I think if you don't overdo it with piercings chains etc you'll look fine. Simplicity is the best policy, and not too much of one thing - esp black! Might unintentionally give the impression that you're gloomy yourself!|`|Bfk4zn1raa	i prefer the "skater" look on guys  i.e. skinny jeans. either converse or nike's|`|bznQW3QYaa	Baggy jeans  and a nice shirt  xD|`|EuwGku8vaa	I work at a bank so nice dress shirts and slacks is what i usually wear...

d28ed6e6ffd2770c91461a1986db486daa	As much as we love nature, it can't completely fix permanant damage.  Try heating up some olive oil in a pan, until its warm. Work it through your hair, leave it on for half an hour (preferably with a towel over it) and then rinse it out. Shampoo after. This is all i can really suggest, but next time your out if you have money - buy a deep conditioning treatment like Hot Oil, or get a deep hair mask from a hairdresser. Both are quite inexpensive.    Good Luck!!|`|D8lmVzyvaa	Use peanut oil or maynoayese! It works great. Trust me :]|`|bYXs9VeOaa	use mayonessi  in you hair  and olive oil|`|18afBRSXaa	get some eggs and get rid of the yolky yellow stuff. Then, get your hair wet, use shampoo, but then massage the eggs in. When your done, use vinegar!|`|Efns4kW5aa	Try any deep conditioining product with Avocado Extracts. Reduce the usage of heat styling prouducts such as straighteners and blow dryers. Allow your hair to air dry as much as possible. Also, do not brush your hair immediatly after taking a shower because this is when your hair is most fragile. If you must, use a wide toothed comb to reduce damage. For shiny hair, rinse with cold water. Hope this helps!|`|44137dc73f9d5ddff50d1edf6ab37668aa	maynoayese works..   but then i always have the problem of my hair smelling bad!!

uzzvz3uDaa	Wear anything Hollister, it really doesn't matter because you are not going to work that day. But to start things off they will give you your discount card, your ID number, and show you how to clock in. after you clock in they will explain everything that you will need to know. ex. dress code, being on time, schedules, w/e. then they will show you a corny video on store theft and what to do to prevent it. The best thing is that you get paid for the orientation. It's like an hour long.|`|3yacqUltaa	Yea, wear all hollister! Sorry, I don't work at Hollister, so I don't know what will happen at orientation, but Hollister employees are probably supposed to wear Hollister (at least their first day)|`|esSq7NNTaa	hollister sweater would be cute..since it is winter..and you will be working there.  then jejeans or skirt&boots would be cute!(:|`|Baxqbf4oaa	Wear everything hollister :P|`|aoxLVIFyaa	I agree. You should probably wear a ton of hollister stuff.

Then either HCO jeans or and HCO skirt with, a Hollister belt. Then Uggs or something else like that for shoes. Since layering is really big in Hollister keep that in mind.  Good luck! (:

It's funny that teenagers beg their parents to buy them jeans that will only last a month or so, because they'd rather look cool in pants that are falling off themselves.  I'm sure you can get a pair of $80 jeans at Hollister.|`|fPviDdmMaa	Go get some jeans somewhere. Take a knife. Rip them. I'm sure the jeans would be fine with it considering that they're depressed. :-)|`|pxEoQ1IWaa	Abercrombie Kids, Abercrombie and Fitch, Hollister, Pacsun, Wet Seal. Oh, and the term is "distressed", haha. :]|`|mSVlAsGhaa	I agree with the answers above. do not buy them. Do what  we did in the 80's and cut them yourself. You will have them one of a kind and can put the rips where you want. Here is how.  Get a pair of jeans that you like but not your favorites. You will need an exacto knife or a utility knife. You will also need a  sturdy,flat surface that can be cut like a piece of plywood, Place the jeans out flat on the board and use the knife to cut slits below the pockets, near the knees etc. Things to watch out for is to make sure the cut does not go through both sides of the jean (a small board slid inside the leg works) and make sure you do not cut the pocket.  When you are done, fray the slits. You can do this by pulling on the little threads where the cuts are.  Wash them, The more you wash the more distressed they will look.|`|3ivRqDQ9aa	u can find them at Charlotte russe, hollister, A&F, American Eagle Outfitters!! in ur size too!|`|4qil1bb8aa	Pacsun(:    http://shop.pacsun.com/girls/jeans/index...

70a43707807dc9900f19f111a38b3d42aa	Have you tried Mederma?    I haven't tried it but I hear it works. It's a bit more expensive than cocoa butter and bio-oil but worth it from what I hear.

70a43707807dc9900f19f111a38b3d42aa	Do you know what these bumps are? Are they acne/pimples? Whiteheads/blackheads perhaps?    If so, keep the area clean and never touch it. Make sure your tweezers are clean also if you pluck your eyebrows. Overall, keep the area CLEAN and free of germs (aka don't touch with your hands!!!)

lHEg75WEaa	I would have to say behind my ear, but my ankle was pretty painful too.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	the back of my hand and top of my foot.    back is ok.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	The ones on my back. The lower back was probably worse, however I was better prepared that time, I'd learnt about breathing and relaxing and also I had my ipod so I could try and zone out for the worst parts. That was a large piece that took four hours which has been my longest single sitting so far. My first upper back was probably all in all the worst, but that was my first tattoo so my nervousness and lack of preparation didn't help. Also I hadn't eaten - eating a meal is very important before getting a tattoo. All my back tattoos have been extremely painful, but I have a very low tolerance. More often than not I hear back tattoos described as 'not that bad' or 'uncomfortable', so hopefully you'll be one of the luckier ones! From what I gather, ribs are probably the worst area to be tattooed, I haven't had a full rib piece yet but when my back tattoos have reached out a little into my ribs, that was certainly the most painful point! I'd do it all over again though. Pain is part of the journey and makes it so worthwhile!|`|kCdISEGqaa	My most painful was under the bend of my arm, near my armpit.  I didn't actually go into the armpit, but that area was horrible.  My wrists were pretty bad too, the closer they got to the palm the more it hurt.  Don't let anyone lie to you, all tattoos hurt, but you can tolerate them.  If anyone tells you they didn't feel theirs, they are lieing (spelling?)!!!  Good luck and have fun with it, the pain is always worth it in the end.|`|1a370a32d49eb577cd4ab9146d28bdd0aa	i dont have any tattoos, but my aunt has a few. not any on her back, but she did get one on her wrist. the guy that did it, said it hurts worst to tattoo over the main vanes. if that makes sense at all.  ive heard, if you get one on ur back,  the top of your back will hurt more than the bottom, and the left hurts more than the right. maybe because its closer to your heart?|`|ss48BEk5aa	Ankle... I have no idea why that spot is so freakin trendy, people are torturing themselves. I have 9 tats all together and that was the worst.|`|pCtWNPVCaa	I have 7 tattoos but the most painful one was on my lower back! and it was 5 hours long. it had a lot of detail....|`|xdeWSxJ4aa	I don't have a tattoo but from what friends have told me, tattoos that are on straight bone (like on your torso under your arm pit, ankle etc.) hurts the most because there's no "cushioning". From what I've heard, back tatts are bearable.|`|2ae0hTVOaa	never got one on my back   but the most painful place i got one at would be the ribs but it was worth it|`|TCINOEX1aa	my neck|`|v5J50Ep2aa	on my ribs! owww but it looks good so it was worth the pain|`|uv0Y7Ar8aa	I have tattoos on my legs from ankle to knee and above knee up thigh , I have tattoos on both my hips , my lower back , my back shoulder blade , back and front of neck , arms , wrist you name it I have it.    My most painful tattoos were as follows:  The top of my foot was extreemly painful  The side of my foot was very tender but I managed  My back on any area was extreemly painful  The back of the neck was tender but I managed|`|zLVZyfwUaa	Top of my foot hands down.  I have a full back tattoo, by my ribs were bad as was the trapezoid muscle on along the shoulder.  But still so worth it|`|rOj4B5QNaa	My ribs were the most painful and the parts that spread across my back were the least.  All in all it depends on how big and how long you go though.  Parts on the bone are always the worst for me, but some people say it's fleshy parts.  I had a guy tell me tonight that his chest was more painful than his knee cap or his head (yes I said head!).  To me my chest has only hurt through the healing process more than my sides.  Pain just as beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
nqkXE1cUaa	When matching the eye shadow to your clothes, it is easy to create a nice dramatic look. Applying the right eye shadow can easily draw attention to your eyes. For instance, if you wear dark clothes that overpower more subtle eyes makeup. Though, you should keep in mind that if a color is looking good applied around your eyes, it doesn't mean that that color is looking good on your clothes. So, when choosing the right eye shadow, you should take into account that the color should not match only your clothes, it has to fit your eye color too.    This method can be applied for any occasion. It will always match the color of your clothes and it has an elegant and natural look. Though, it has a disadvantage, that it can't fit to everyone. For example, it is not the best method for those with blue eyes and dark brown hair. Another drawback is that you can't be sure about the natural coloring and how to find it in an eye shadow. Though, you can consult a makeup artist to find out your skin nuance and to choose the perfect eye shadow.    Like I said before, choosing an eye shadow that fits to you can be a difficult thing to do sometimes.  In the beginning, you should start by buying some cheap shadows in different colors and find out which of those fits to you. Before applying the shadow on your eyelids, you should test it on the inside center of the forearm (not on the back of your hand, like a lot of women do). Mixing the colors together can also be a great idea. By doing that, you can easily obtain the color you want. Next after finding the color that fits to your eyelids, you can try its different tones, for a flawless and natural eye shadow.    An important tip is that lavender fits to any eye color, especially for blue eyes.    If you don't like to wear an eye shadow color, or if you have not find it yet, you can apply bronzer or body glitter instead. You can apply silver if you want a little color, also. After the application, it is time for mascara.    Above you can find some tips about how to choose the right makeup for blue eyes. Now, you will find out what colors to avoid. Even if they seem to match, there are a lot of colors which can make you look bad if you are wearing them.    Never apply blue! It will distract the attention from your eyes and this is not good at all. Your eyes should always be the center of attention.    The brown eye shadow is also not recommended. Like the blue color, it will distract the attention from your eyes. Brown is the opposite of blue so it would not make you look good.    Like blue and brown, the gold color won't look good for those with blue eyes. Though, if you have tan skin, you can wear it. If you don't, you can use silver as an alternative.|`|Tj94JEMJaa	You could get that eye make up {forgot what its called} that goes with your certain eye color. i saw it at walmart.              all i really know is that when you put on mascare kind of shake it from side to side up.|`|Dh5CUjmkaa	I would buy a light beige eyeshadow and one that is darker. You can use brown eyeliner or black and also brown mascara or black. I would put the lightest eyeshadow on the eyelid to the crease, then put the darker color in the crease. Then line and apply mascara. You can use your choice on whether to line both top and bottom lids. I was taught by my Mother that for an evening look you would line both and for a day look you just line either the top or bottom. This is a very basic way of doing it . They say for blue eyes you should use brown to bring out the blue.|`|FklngtvCaa	brown, purple, blue, and charcoal gray.  i'd say avoid black since it's too harsh and pink  since it could make you look like you've got pink eye lol.  http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...  baked  metalhead  stage dive  air guitar  glam rock  spandex    funky names, huh? :)
Jh0yyYizaa	Woah school yearbook photo ??   Man, I'm so jealous...  I don't think our school (in Aus) even has yearbooks... so unfair!     Okay to make it look natural yet nice I'd:  -Add a little white eyeliner/shimmer to the corners of your eyes.  -Black or brown (brown is more natural) to your top lash line and smudge a bit.   -Black or brown mascara to top lashes and if you want - a little mascara to bottom lashes    Skin:  -Apply a natural foundation (such as bare minerals or Revlon 'beyond natural')  -A little blush or bronzer (that goes well with your skin tone, you don't want it looking abnormal!)  -Lipgloss in a pale pink or nude shade.     Have fun... wow its just like Lizzie McGuire ... Sorry but I've never been to an American school sooo I'm not really used to what you guys do.   =D=D|`|bOn6sKNIaa	eyes: mascara on the top.  brow/tan eyeshadows.  lips:A tiny bit of gloss.  Face:foundation.|`|Rh9Dp5K6aa	Neutral colors...No heavy liner (if any) for daytime. Try to minimize shine as much as possible, conceal any problem areas if necessary. I really like bare minerals mineral foundation and warmth.|`|aEFTqJOtaa	use a tinted moisturizer instead of foundation so that your face blends with the color of your neck. You dont want to look like one of those pale girls with the super tan faces.lol. add lip gloss, mascara and a light amount of eye shadow.|`|sXQlS1aPaa	Makeup doesnt make you look like a slut if you know how to do it. Browns are boring.  Pick a main color.. silver/white... the lightest color.  That goes over your eyelid.  Then your darker color goes in the outer corner and then goes slighty above the lid.  Liquid eyeliner works wonders, try to get it as close to your lash line as possible.. and thicker isnt always the better way to go.  Mascara, mascara mascara.      Uhm... just try a little bit of color in the cheeks if the eyes are bold and just pack on the blistex.    Its hard to explain how to do makeup.  Take it for what its worth though.|`|uOuLU8tZaa	Uh, powder foundation is really good if you're looking for a more natural look. And a nice pinkish-brown eye shadow. Brown eyeliner, and chapstick for your lips :)|`|nqkXE1cUaa	people want to see you, not you looking like a slut.  where black mascara, no eyeliner, no eyeshadows  wear light foundation  rose colored cheeks  carmex, gives a glossy look while enhances lips  or chapstick for enhancing without gloss

SGBOUJ1Zaa	only if you scrubed|`|7PUmsocmaa	Hi , Dove Summer Glow is basically a mixture of fake tan and moisturiser. With most fake tan products you need to allow the product around 6-8hours to develop then you are able to have a shower or bath.     So yes if you had a bath just after applying your tan then it would wash off. The best way to use this product is after your shower/bath either in the morning or night and that way you probably won't be getting wet for another 8 hours and it will have plenty of time to develop.    Let me know if you have any more questions!

BBK7i1A7aa	Photoshop. Ha, seriously, nobody's face looks like that. Totally airbrushed.   But anyhoo, just follow these tips and you should be good:   1. Wash your face in the morning and right before you go to bed  2. Don't wear a lot of makeup or foundation (it dries your skin out and doesn't let it "breathe")  3. Use acne cream (Neutrogena is really good)  4. Moisturize daily ( especially at night right before you go to bed)   And also, as you get older, your hormones will settle down and your skin will too. Good luck!|`|jPJaSIXPaa	well just wear alot of makeup like her u will look fake just like her|`|7nrhPCf0aa	wash your face twice a day, put gentle but effective face medicine on at night and wear some concealer that hides redness. lol|`|wKjFn7Nsaa	Its been edited a little, and then made to look like it was a bad quality camera and not edited at all.|`|IUGS32wfaa	ugh. the only way is to be lucky. i guess you could try zit cream or wear face makeup. shes definitely wearing makeup|`|AA11912291	umm... photoshop?     sorry for the sarcasm.  but i have really nice skin (not to brag) and i put a honey mask on my face every once in a while... its amaazing!|`|8efAFIKcaa	Nuterogina Facewash In the morining and at night   Bare MInerals Foundation she has the starter pack only put a little bit on   That gal primer brightner Benefit mixed with Ulimating monsrizure Nuteriohna    and i have proof that i do know her and her face is that flawless:  http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2d264he&...

Rh9Dp5K6aa	Dark color usually covers most. Dont dye your hair blonde from a bottle. Blonde and highlights is always best left to the pros. and it is expensive so maybe wanna stay dark for now. Trust me, when I was your age, my friends and I would dye our hair blonde from a bottle. its one of our favorite, "what were we thinking?" moments to laugh about. Just re-dye with a dark SEMI-permanent color every four wks or so, as needed. If you want to go back light, the best way to do that is starting with a partial highlight. It will help blend the light coming through with the dark. But get ready to spend about $75 every two months. Good luck!|`|EnYLhQajaa	Go to your salon and ask for advice.|`|zW4c2dyVaa	I would recommend going to a salon because they can help with the color and get your hair healthy again. I wouldn't do anything else until you go see a proffesional|`|ezPGXMWuaa	Get your hair stripped. It takes the colour you have in now out and let you dye it another colour.  Ask at a local salon or google it.|`|LM4vwHEyaa	go to the hairdressers and ask them to strip all of the dyes out of your hair, b/c it will be back to your natural colour. then you will have a clean template to start from, but i suggest not dying your hair for a long time and using deep conditioners or hair masques to help with hair reconstruction. that's all i can say, hope this helps!|`|18afBRSXaa	Use shampoo, conditioner, etc to get EVERY SINGLE CHEMICAL out of your hair. Then, once its somewhat close to your natural color, try to get a new cut. And if the dye is too strong dye your roots.|`|wnmUVQdnaa	GO TO A SALON.    seriously. don't do ANYTHING else at home except put a deep conditioner (Aussie 3 Minute Miracle, olive oil, ANYTHING) on it every day until you go to a salon.     ask them to go back to your natural color at the salon, and just leave it alone for a while. i'm 16, and had the same situation as you a few years back. my dad told me what i'm telling you, and i didn't listen, but i wish i had. lol.|`|2GubMjldaa	go to a real salon and they'll help u get everything 'right' without making ur hair so damaged that it breaks off and goes wonky|`|beX6Rvqtaa	go to a salon they will fix everything for ya!
XO5Puz9Taa	I've done it on my hair and it's dyed bleach blonde;  It works very good, Black or Brown works.    Just take a long strand of hair and hold it out,  Then move the brush up and down.:)    It comes out right when you shampoo your hair in the shower,  and it looks real!:D|`|wnmUVQdnaa	i'd just buy cheap clip in coontails. google it. etsy.com will probably have them too.  mascara will look fake and stupid.|`|beX6Rvqtaa	ok mascara ew!! its clumpy no no no use a black marker!  and no it will not stain your hair haha just use black washable crayola marcker but masara will be very hard to take out and wont look good!!|`|v202XHZNaa	Excuse me?|`|eKiDXLDtaa	They have clip in ones at beauty stores|`|UaFqS9y5aa	YES IT WILL WASH OUT WITH SHAMPOO|`|KdNbFB6Eaa	dont get coon tails cuz then ull look like a poser scene chick
iLM4WbSwaa	I think a white (or any light colored) tailored shirt would look cute and professional.  Especially if you get the kind with the light "ruffles" down the front.  You could wear white, any light blue, turquoise obvi, pastel orange, or a light heather grey.|`|MGjMjWwaaa	those are cute it would look good with a yellow blazer or black|`|CFU77qCbaa	A blue shirt like the lady has on in the picture!|`|SCTMtrjhaa	A blue shirt like the lady has on in the picture!|`|t9rulFv4aa	I think they are really classic, and it sounds like you have enough options.

If you do some weight lifting, even more sexier! If you shave it, Girls may complain about. But if you wax it, it will eventually grow slower and not so strong, so your chest won't bother your partner!
vpYiYnSLaa	ALWAYS after! See, the key to concealer is to pick a shade lighter than your foundation because the lighter color covers up the tones better than one of your own skin color. If you apply concealer before your foundation, you just cover up the light color you put on and the concealer does nothing! thats why you apply your skin-toned foundation FIRST then apply the lighter concealer SECOND. I hope I helped!|`|r6FS7fCbaa	after and blend it in with a brush. looks totally nice|`|FklngtvCaa	before.|`|0d88ab7c3e5ace15a916d7103b2561abaa	always after foundation|`|BuxDT0Akaa	before|`|A8OVGLdiaa	u always put concealer after the foundation, it never goes first.  u can google it too and you will find videos abt it. u can specify it if u wanna find the eye makeup tips only.|`|cjlWiqqCaa	I was watching what not to wear and the makeup artist Carmidy said to apply it after foundation.

DeWADdQaaa	i figure the last kind of answer you want to hear is   omg your fine!    so against my will i will give you my opinion.   Dye your hair darker, use eyeliner and mascara to accentuate your eyes and wear clothing like wide leg jeans and shirts that come down farther than your waist and flow away from the body, this will make you look thinner and draw attention to your face and not your tummy :)     be confident in yourself and make sure that whoever leaves bad remarks, let them roll off your shoulders. they don't know you and thier not even gonna remember commenting on these photos|`|mMvEEZ3oaa	eye make-up!|`|r18PoGJiaa	Why the heck are you worrying about this?

Maybe do some extra chores around the house and then hit the dollar store!  I love dollar stores.    Added - don't listen to those losers telling you to lose weight.  You are absolutely fine in your weight.|`|wiJBiwmQaa	lose weight...grow hair...eye makeup|`|tMvHR1n3aa	you need to lose a little weigth start ..do it the healty way or you turn skinny and ugly..so be healthy and get highlights and low lights ..go to a more high end salon  to get a hair cut and where some masrcara...and you be fine,,keep your natural lookk...your only 13 so no point piling on make up.that early..|`|VqaqG6gsaa	why does it look like you wher just cut out of a magizne that or someone bit you?|`|772eb8033f8cd1d1706fa978e8019111aa	You are gorgeous & your way too young to be worrying! :/  If you need makeup or hair tips.. go on youtube.

Get clothes that actually fit.  Look at girls at school what are they wearing? Get ideas from them but DO NOT copy.  Make up, foundation and mascara.  Wax your eyebrows it does wonders for everyone.  Grow your hair and get a flat iron.|`|1gDPb4yEaa	First off, I don't think its that your unattractive (because your not), but you do come off as kind of plain. What I did in about 8th grade was start to change my image. I started shopping at different shops, that I could afford, and I also started to grow my hair out, and got it layered. I would try to shop at places like Forever 21 or H&M. I just bought a sweater from Forever 21 for only 10.00! Also a little bit of natural makeup is key. The secret is too make it look like your not wearing makeup!|`|aUIsuOEaaa	you're pretty =].you should curl your hair.|`|DLzbbLDqaa	If you had to change yourself ,the easiest way would be to doit is to wear a lot of color.Neon is really in ritenow, but not roo much.don't layer all the time.wear a 1 layer shirt once in a while.put your hair half up, in two pigtails, or in a high pony tail, or put some sparkling clips in it.that way you will look improved!|`|GOAGQZg3aa	grow ur hair out longer. and start wearing a little eye liner. liner really will pop ur insanely Beautiful eyes!!! you really don't need to loose that much weight so yea (that is my opinion) :)|`|SZ9Cm5f2aa	First of all, you need a nicer picture the editing is not that good on them. It's not that your not pretty, you just need some small changes.  Second of all, you have a very round face, like me.  My suggestion is grow it out until just past your shoulders to eliminate such roundness in the face. You need more colour in your clothes. Gray and black colours make you look kinda boring. Try brighter colours like Yellow or Red or Pink! Pink looks good on everyone, at least that's what my pink crazed best friend says haha. Ok, maybe try getting just clear brace colour so it doesnt stand out as much. Hope this helps you! And again you are pretty! You just need a few changes to make yourself feel better about urself. I'm not all that great either you know. :)|`|0V6IrruAaa	You would look pretty if you lost a little bit of weight, highlights would look pretty in your hair, perhaps a caramel colour? Also, braces colours, a blue or purple always look good, I had them. Makeup would be very pretty on you, a violet liner, NYC makes a very nice, inexpensive one, line the top lid and half of the bottom to pop your eyes, and perhaps a gold shadow as well as a light peachy blush and a light lipgloss, something pinky/peachy. A coat of mascara, and off you go! For hair, a choppy style would look nice, and clothes, something with an empire waist to accentuate your figure, as well as jeans in a dark wash and perhaps a nice wedge heel? I dont know how tall you are, but a cute ballet flat always looks chic.   Hope it helps!|`|EzBGRjZMaa	ugly is ugly|`|YSAU1e9Paa	practice on your posture( hold your shoulders back, keep your stomach tight) give your hair some volume maybe a tousled wave and since your kinda young for makeup maybe some lipgloss. Don't wear you clothes so loose.|`|KkhlLy2Haa	Well, being only 13 you'll still grow. You're body is still changing.  I don't think its important for you to be worrying about appearance at your age, but if you want advice here you go:     Maybe look at some hair styles that go with your face shape, add some funky layers? Maybe dye you're hair to change things up a bit.    If you wear makeup, stay away from foundations and cover ups, your face needs to breath, no matter what age.    For weight, again, you're still growing and with that you'll become more lean. But if you aren't happy with your weight, maybe look into doing palates or yoga? They're fun and easy to do.    For the colors of your braces, definitely stay away from yellows and greens, oranges, whites, any light colors or colors that will make you're teeth look dirty. But any other colors would be good. Blues, purples, pinks, black, reds.|`|Xl88AmV4aa	ok well, yes you are pretty in a plain way here are some tips to make you look amazingg!    Makeup...  Skin- put on some foundation. Def. the bare minerals foundation because it is light but makes a huge difference!  Cheeks- get some color! use a tiny bit of blush and put it on the apples of your cheeks!  Eyes- ok, for shadow, I would go with some light color because you are naturaly pale and it would look pretty wierd if you had on really smocky eyeshadow. You should use some dark brown or black eyeliner and some black mascara.  Hair- def. grow it out and put in side bangs! That would fit your face frame much better  Clothes- Shop at places like, Abercrombie, Hollister, American Eagle, Victoria Secret because they have the cutest clothes EVER!!! (you don't have to tho, im nawt forcing you haha) BUT.... you kinda have to loose some weight first, no offense.   If you just got a new hairstyle, makeup, and dropped a couple pounds, you would be GORGEOUS!!!! good luck!!  -Skye:)|`|AXygnMNpaa	First of all, beauty comes with age, trust me. I wasn't that great at 15 and i had a baby face just like you, but now i'm 18 and guys say i'm really hot. So don't worry ur still rly rly cute & u have great features! But if ur still in need of a change ( i know how that feels ) blonde hair would really go well on u! I have a friend that looks just like you & when she died her hair it was soooo pretty! Maybe wearing bright coloured clothes could help too and exercise always helps (don't worry ur not fat at all & it doesn't make u ugly) and when u will lose your braces u'll be super pretty!!
Ce2bovaVaa	A really quick, cute idea is to take a handful of hair from the top of your head and twist it a few times (a poof will form on the top of your head). Don't twist too tightly. Secure it with 2 bobby pins. And then gather the rest of your hair into any kind of bun (1-2 inches of the twist should be visible). It takes about 30 seconds, and it's just a nice little detail to an otherwise ordinary bun.    Another one, a personal favorite of mine, is to curl your entire head with a flat iron (starting at about an inch from your roots). Use a little spray wax for a beachy, messy texture. Then gather your hair into a low, side ponytail. Shake it gently or pull out any shorter layers you have, for the ultimate laid-back summer look. Check out the video below:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTB1MOb2T...|`|b1b6e3d33b1a99da35a245dd5c6cae76aa	1) Pin half of your hair back and pin it to the back of your head.  It sounds weird but try it, it's cute.    2) Make "the bump" then curl your hair.|`|OujY7GcDaa	Well you can put your hair in a ponytail with a ribbon or somethign and curl the ends.Or ponytails.Or out in a messy side bun and let strands hang. And you canput it in a ponytail and out like a puff where you take a piece of hair and tease under it so it gets a lil puffy! Godd Luck with your hairstyles! :)|`|VQzYYYaEaa	this is really simple but looks chic.  When your hair is wet, towel dry it and then put it in a loose high ponytail.  Then grab bobby pins and start grabbing medium-sized chunks of hair and pin them in random places.  Leave your bangs out and straighten them.  Hairspray everything lightly.  It takes about 10 minutes! =)|`|x5R1zUtraa	Something like this ..      http://s701.photobucket.com/albums/ww15/...|`|HSXLzwE1aa	This yahoo group has tons of pictures of the latest hairstyles and new pictures are being added all the time.

Her hair is just around her chin, maybe a bit shorter.<br>  I think that would be a perfect lenght for you.<br>  You have curly hair, which tends to go a bit frizzy. with a shorter lenght it will be more manageable and will curl a lot nicer with the right products !<br>  make sure the hairdresser doesn't thin out your hair with a razor. This will make your hair very frizzy and unmanageable! Also.... I would not cut your hair much shorter than suggested. your have a lot of hair, which is curly on top of it ! Any shorter and you will have very buffy, high hair!
UByvC54Xaa	Ok, these are not dreadlocks. These are african braids. I don't know much about braids (im a dreadlock gal). You will have to do up a new question in yahoo answers about african braids.

Perhaps it is jusst the name "dreadlock" that gets that response.|`|FnQWXyp8aa	ugh, you obviously havent done your research on dreads. Theyre greasy. smelly.

QoYWBD5raa	Ben is horribly annoying, I agree.  I can't stand how he keeps wanting to completely control Amy and keep Ricky away from the baby, which, biologically, is his (Ricky's).  Also, if I were pregnant, I wouldn't want people in the birthing room with me either.  Especially if it was just my boyfriend, and he seemed to just be poking into my life like he owned it.      I can't believe the baby is going to be a boy... I so wanted it to be a girl.  It made me cry when she was making the video for her baby =(    You are the first person who has ever agreed with me that Amy and Ricky should end up together!  Everyone else I've talked to, they think Ricky is stupid and should just go away and stay with Adrienne or whatever, but I feel like Ricky has always secretly cared about Amy, and really loves her and wants to do what's best for her and the baby.    I (also) completely cried when Ricky cried (though that might be because I'm a completely overly sensitive person).  You feel so bad for Ricky... I couldn't tell if he was crying because he was so happy (I assume this is the reason) or because he couldn't believe Adrienne went so far to help him.    I can't wait for next week's show.  This might be where Ben breaks up with Amy, and Ricky and her get really close! I certainly hope so!|`|38e8zcpYaa	Dude! Ben is SO annoying!  And Ricky is HOTT! If Amy and Ricky got together  and stayed together that would be awesome!  Because I think Ricky has really changed since he has been with Grace! And Ben is just like a naggy old woman. Ugh.    Haha(:|`|n9MOzshiaa	omg I do!!! and ya i soooo agree!!! like ben is soooo UGLY, akward, and not popular. Ricky is the hot one, she should marry him!!!|`|ll5lS1wmaa	I hate Ben, but I kind of hate Amy, too. She's annoying and kind of moronic. I much prefer the Adrienne/Ricky/Jack/Grace storyline.|`|LXCfeUbjaa	i do!  i agreee.|`|vvEGTerGaa	omg i cried too  i want amy and ben to break up and i want her and ricky to get together  i LOVE that show =]|`|ELy7NK0Eaa	OMG SAME!  I hate Ben, I love Ricky and Amy.  I hate that Ricky is cheating on like everyone, but its all good -he's hottttt|`|3yacqUltaa	I watch it, too.   I used to like Ben, but now he's just getting on my nerves.   I hope Amy keeps the baby, and Ben backs off.  Omg I was so happy for Ricky when his dad went back to jail!!|`|AA12160009	Holy crap I could go on and on.I think Ben is over dramatic and he always says I love you and rushes everything! I mean really, getting married? What would that do? I know that Amy wanted it but Ben proposed. I think he wants to be the father way too much. I watched the episode on Monday and don't you have the feeling that Veronica might be Ricky's real mom? I mean she said she married a guy that looked like Jesus and Bob kinda looks like it.  Ok I do not know why Ricky was crying!!!Why was he crying. It seemed like he was crying tears of sadness when it was supposed to be portrayed as tears of joy! It looked like he didn't want his dad to be in jail, even after what he was trying to do.  I love Amy and she is doing all this so responsibly. I mean like Ben is just trying to act like the father and he isn't! I mean Ricky should be there during the birth and the sonogram, and I know that he should be involved. Even though what he did is wrong, he loves that baby and Amy, I think loves Ricky. Ok well that's all off my chest!|`|dFvdeXt9aa	yea ben is really annoying!!! i just want him to go away and leave amie alone! haha yea but ricky? damn hes just hot ;)|`|7nrhPCf0aa	i know, Ben is getting annoying. I feel sooooo bad for Ricky! I hate his dad! I almost cried when Amy was making the movie for her baby. lol|`|esSq7NNTaa	OMG BEN PISSES ME OFF!  its likes, you in freaking hish school, stop intruding on amyslifeyou dont own her!  like dump ben go out with ricky..please amyyy!    ahhh i HATE ben.

uM9vh4X3aa	Use a Minerals based product, as these are generally non pore clogging and are less likely to harbour bacteria, so you have to make sure to keep it away from water too. Check the labelling for any ingredients you know are allergic too (Lanolin (moisturising agent) is a common one, but usually only exists in miniscule amounts in higher-end products if at all) or ask a sales assistant.

dyXN0grpaa	omg wear both!.   if that doesnt work just wear the skinnies|`|aoxLVIFyaa	In my opinion both are cool.  But it all depends on what you're going to wear on top.   And Ironically  I'm wearing white skinnies too!  Except there from American Eagle|`|1a14D4X6aa	sounds really warm out...to me..but then again I live in Canada lol ...mini skirt...with black leggings underneath unless you think thats cold then wear the skinny jeans|`|4n6yhUbyaa	jeans pair it with converse or a cute pair of heals and a tee or a polo that isn't varry low cut    heals like these    http://www.charlotterusse.com/product/in...|`|6QGa33pAaa	uh the skinny jeans?  a little cold to wear the mini skirt.  unless you were going to wear something under it, of course. like tights?|`|80OzOx2Caa	Why would you wear a mini skirt? Do you want to freeze to death, girl? =D I guess you could wear it with leggings and a cute tee.|`|pvKbsrzaaa	neither.  wear your birthday suit.|`|AA12160009	I would go with the skinny jeans just because it's freezing. Some uggs or some gladiators would look really cool. A nice flowy top with a pop of color in jewelry or in your hair would look really cool. A nice jacket under the snow jacket with your hair in a sloppy bun makes you look good!|`|aEFTqJOtaa	the skinny jeans... duh|`|NyiMHsfeaa	why in the world would u wear a mini when its 27 [even if you wear tights]    skinny jeans and a cute hoodie with flats or sneakers|`|ELy7NK0Eaa	Oh, deff a mini skirt!

XL9CUrp2aa	Have you tried shopping in the petites department?  Or even kids departments.  Thats what my sister does and the clothes are cheaper in the kids department too.|`|hH1eNmUyaa	As if cheap, you're talking about $33 or less.? pacsun has some for $30 something dollars.. i'm a size double zero or just zero. those are the smallest sizes. or 19 as the waist. ...or at tillys. there you go!|`|PTP8ptDbaa	make sure they are a tight fit if you are still not growing!|`|EpZfJPG5aa	well in my opinion. if u cant fit into the sizes they have ur too small and they wont look good on u. im sry.|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	Victoria's secret.|`|cWqVZ33laa	you can try Wet Seal..they have Short, Medium, and Tall lengths for every size...and the prices are reasonable! sometimes they have buy one pair of jeans and get the other half off...or their website is Wetseal.com|`|3eUf3JBmaa	i have similar problems... i'm short and skinny. i buy all my pants at pacsun [or pacific sunwear] and american eagle. they sell super skinny and short sizes. the bullheads are my favorite [pacsun link]. they sell super skinny's 2 pairs for $64|`|pUsdnm5Caa	paint them on    its sexier|`|997b30eb591fbc4794a68474522f179aaa	If you have a mall around you there are usually cheap places in malls, such as rave, rue 21, debs, rainbow, etc.  You could even try looking at target for cheap skinny jeans.  Just try the sizes on--most places like these sell 00, 0, 1, 3, and some places even have size 2.
u4FUeppNaa	Avoid soft colors like yellow and white, they will make you look washed out.

hjLXy56qaa	blonde looks so good in brown hair|`|b7gUW0CRaa	kind of like a blondissshhhh color|`|sbzq5xDAaa	blonde|`|Og4Wuqn4aa	Blonde looks okay on guys (if you like that kind of girly look). I think it's pretty cute when guys have one streak of pink right next to their face. It looks so adorable!! ^.~|`|BnLoaRsNaa	Well, I would have to say that maybe.........    yellow  red  blonde  black  highlights   i would do that if i were u
MBC3KzCNaa	I'd recommend a salt water solution.  Get a bowl and put in some rock salt and then add some pre-boiled water and wash the piercing with this at least twice a day.  It'll look pink and fleshy as it's healing and an open wound at the moment. Try not to twist it much it could get infected.  They normally pierce at 1.2 or 1.6. Be careful with rings (BCR- ball closure ring) as they increase the risk of infection in a new piercing.  After the healing time is over you'll be able to put a stud in it yes.|`|rurfFLDkaa	heres a tragus....|`|7Q1dJoFzaa	uggh wtf is a tragus and why did you have yours penetrated?|`|rkufaNiPaa	use a cotton bud and some warm salt water that should help to heal it and keep it clean (:|`|DCPiL4Rjaa	that's just disgusting.|`|H7kmp0qdaa	They usually are pierced at an 18 or 16 gauge and both are bigger than a standard stud, but you can switch once it's healed. The most important thing you can do to help it heal is NOT touch it and move is up and down. Only touch it to clean it and after you have washed your hands first. Never heard of witch hazel on piercings, but sea salt soaks are the best way to help heal faster also.|`|DxfFItv2aa	you pierced your what?  when?  where?  how?  with what?  who did it?  are you feeling dizzy at all?  or sore?|`|B9d5YN1Baa	what the hell is a tragus?|`|ELEEe5Fhaa	The tragus piercing is a perforation of the tragus for the purpose of inserting and wearing a piece of jewelry. The tragus projects immediately in front of the ear canal. The piercing itself is usually made with a small gauge hollow piercing needle, and typical jewelry would be a small diameter captive bead ring or small gauge post style piercing jewelry. A related piercing is known as the Antitragus piercing.    The hollow, low-gauge needle used for the piercing can be either straight or curved, depending on the piercer's preference. Once the needle penetrates the tragus, it is driven into a tiny cork placed immediately behind the tragus to prevent entry into the aural canal.
tUYkerS9aa	This is purely a matter of opinion. Whatever you've got don't ruin it with surgery like so many woman and men have.|`|392052a3dbd6d94cc65100310f44fccfaa	I've got a thing for small noses,like,i LOVE them.But,beauty wise,i know real beauties with small/medium noses,but some can be very pretty despite a big nose.I think it's the shape of it that matters most when it comes to rating it as a pretty nose or not.Size,doesn't matter too much.As long as it doesn't look exaggerated on your face and is somewhat proportioned to your face size,then it's all good,even if it'd be on the bigger side.    My nose is long and straight and from the side,it's pointy,but frontal,it doesn't look that pointy at all (weird nose).I've always thought it's average or biggish....but people say it's average to small...So,be careful with rating yourself,most of the times,we're too critical of ourselves.I actually once said i wanted to make my nose smaller,and i got the odd looks from them(friends) like:"You want it SMALLER than THAT?!' lol Yeah,you get what i'm saying.    A perfect nose to me is Angelina Jolie's,Kate Hudson,Charlize Theron,Sharon Stone....Uma Thurman has a slightly big nose,but it looks awesome on her face.|`|hcHvCGHMaa	dont get ur question|`|IldJjjlcaa	what? Who cares? All three can be attractive. I think men tend to look better with medium to big noses, whereas women probably look better with smaller noses but there are still hot girls with big noses. Don't really know measurements, depends how it fits with rest of face.|`|PnHcsa47aa	Large: Barbara Streisand  Small: Michael Jackson (let's admit it: he's more girly than most girls)  Medium: Just about everyone else
C0HZ8ZB4aa	You shouldn't pick a tattoo placement based on how much it will hurt you. If you can't stand the pain then have a henna tattoo. I am the world's biggest wimp with pain. I've wriggled, complained and wanted to die throughout many of my tattoos. I'm not one of these that reckons they don't hurt that much. I have as low a pain threshhold as is possible to have. But my first ever tattoo was a piece on my back that went across my shoulder blades and spine and took just under 3 hours. And I kept going back for more. A star or a loveheart will take about 3 minutes. Even if you got it on the worst area of your body (which the wrist, by all accounts, is not), it's just 3 minutes. If I could last 3 hours first time, then you can cope with a few minutes. It's the duration of the pain which is the worst thing. When it's been going over the same area for hours on end. There's just no sense in having a tattoo placed in a 'second best' area because of the pain you'd have been in for a few minutes. You'll have this all your life, long after the pain is over. The pain is part of the whole journey.|`|JK2RvliYaa	The closer to the bone, the more painful it is. I got one on my calf it was so easy & painless I could have fallen asleep.|`|IWGSD34Oaa	inside ur mouth,  your mouth heals the fastest  and its hidden so  you have a better chance of   getting a job and crap  andddd its not a boring place.  :]  or perhaps the neck!|`|LBHJaqXoaa	You hate needles and your pain tolerence is low... then I would send you in for a tattoo on your shoulder. Its a nice, meaty area that doesn't have a whole lot of nerve endings and you can't see the needles while you're getting it. It also won't stretch out and look gross if you get fat.     However, even though the wrist hurts its not unbearable and it would be a good opportunity to get over your fear of needles.|`|yXDtGo8taa	The arm or shoulder would probably be less painful|`|NBK3s2LVaa	breast tattoos hurt the least|`|WkD9oAUiaa	actually this may sound weird but everyone i met said their foot hurt the most, but to me it hurt the least. and my feet are bony too. it all depends on where you would want one. you dont want one too visable, e.g. your face, wrist, forearm, ect. but i would go for eaither the back of your shoulder, foot or even your lower back. don't listen to people that say " oh that spot hurts!" cuz everyone is different when it comes to pain. Good luck and i hope i helped!

BwD8oKvxaa	Yeah I think so too. People are stupid enough to believe that if they wear that kind of stuff they'll reach the next level in popularity or something. I mean you buy a pair of ripped stained jeans for a 100 bucks at Hollister when you can easily get the same look from Wal- Mart jeans, if you just wear them enough, for only $15. What's the point of that?|`|Ddfff5psaa	Ugh I HATED that last year( I was stil in highschool).... Especially since now hollister puts their logo on everything! So you see a bunch of "holister" tee's walking around in the halls!  I do think it is wayyy overworn... Another thing I hate is that hollister and abercrombie are pricey, so when they have a clearance everyone runs and gets everything and the stores are a mess! It really bugs me.  I like Aero too.... I kinda bought some cute stuff I liked at those stores and sometimes I do now (even though everything, from every season looks the SAME!)... but yea your right, some people will go and not be themselves just to wear a popular hip brand.....  I myself love pink from VS, and some stuff from AE, and Buckle..... I don't like how the jeans fit from abercrombie, all of them are really flimsy and don't look right with a belt.|`|K4Pwd3kfaa	Hollister, out of all things, actually makes you popular??? Wow....that's pretty tacky. What has this world come to?! Everything that's "stylish" is based around those brands now...what happened to Ralph Lauren, J.Crew, Juicy, and Lacoste (my fave brands)??? Let me rephrase that, what happened to CLASS??? It's all gone to practically trash!!! I'm 13 and I'm not wearing that stuff! People should try to find their own style, not just copy everyone else on the block, but unfortunately, it looks like that's what the world has turned into.|`|L1pdChkhaa	Wearing Hollister doesn't make anyone popular...<br>  I swear like everryyonnee in my school wears Aero! It makes me mad because sometimes I actually want to wear Aero, but if I do, chances are about 57 other girls will have on the same thing!|`|Xl88AmV4aa	I loveeeeeeee Hollister and Abercrombie!!!! I like their stuff, and I'm popular, but I don't do it just to BE popular.

I dont wear it just because everyone else is wearing it though. I wear it because i like it...i think that their tops are reallllly cute and i like their jeans because there the only ones i can find that are really lowcut (without a big bulky crotch). but i dont wear there clothes to "make me cool," and i think that its the same with a lot of other girls. just cause we like it doesnt mean we're "followers" or anything.<br>  <br>  <br>  answer my question PLEASE :]|`|f2PDWxGoaa	LIVE & LET LIVE! Jesus Christ!!<br>  Worry about your self, why is it that you have think they wear it to look cool? Maybe they like it, unless they came up to you & said "HEY! I WEAR HOLLISTER BECAUSE I WANT TO BE POPULAR"<br>  You need to stop and mind your buisness. Any race, Any size, Any personality can wear what THEY please, and YOU cannot take that right away from them. YOU DO NOT OWN THESE BRANDS, THEY ARE MEANT TO BE FAMOUS, WHAT IS YOUR DEAL GIRL?|`|SjNwUpAOaa	I think if you wear it just to be cool or popular and it ISN'T your style then that's just lame. I'm trying to stay away from the LABELED hollister stuff because that's very high school to me and I've been out of high school for almost 3 years but the tanks and other stuff is still pretty cute :)|`|50EsQGZMaa	i agree with you on Hollister, Aero and A&F, but with American Eagle?<br>   i have to strongly disgree with you on that one. ae has MANY MANY different styles and colors. just look at their store. AF, Hco have the same polos as the year before just in a slighltly different color. and aero is VERY VERY overworn. thats why i dont like it. i stay with EXPRESS, Forever21 for guys which is heritage1981, metro park, H&M, and more of my style. my shoes inlcude a little of vans, alot of nike high top dunks diff colors, and stylish shoes.|`|5iEIhEmZaa	Ugh...those brands make me sick. Absolutely no sense of style AT ALL.  But no, those brands don't make people popular, but they like to think it does.|`|oN8HwXTYaa	no!!! maybe they wear it cuz the same reasons you do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! your probably just mad your not popular lol jk!!!  i mean not just popular girls wear it!!!! i wear it yes but there are some of those nerdy girls who wear it to|`|D7JZPxDzaa	yahh i agree with you<br>  <br>  everybody lookz the same now with the hollister clothes. Kinda lame|`|594sWJ3Taa	ya
mMvEEZ3oaa	check out the videos on youtube! they are great|`|SR5zlAl8aa	use a curling iron|`|98LDN0Quaa	that guys annoying ^|`|CqLo8nk2aa	I have naturally curly hair, but if it doesn't look good when its curly than i will straighten it, and curl it with my flat iron. I have a coloris iron, and it really curls hair well.    Heres a video how how to curl your hair with a flat iron:  http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv-JSQbcuH...    and if you have a curling iron, and find that better than heres a video with tips on how to keep curls and get the type of curls you want:    http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=CWRtOQIaLg...|`|LJxKNAdVaa	go here       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWRtOQIaL...|`|ktRoqxXRaa	what i do is:    wash hair,, and then rub in smoothing serum and curling mousse.. to wet hair, then tip your head upside down gather all your hair and bunch/scrunch it all on top of your head in a messy type bun.. while in the bun depending on how much time you have you may want to blow dry it.. or just sleep on it, in the morning you will have real curly hair kind of like dianne vickers...    always use hairspray but not too much or you will get a hay kind of texture.    If you want to use curling irons dont straighten your hair first.. its like training a dog you cant teach it to sit and use the same command for teaching it to lie down.. it wont work    hope i helped x|`|qkNyiOrxaa	if you are using a curler:    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=R2fUVmI9wK...    if you are using a straightener:    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=fpl9KYzmJ6...    hope this helps|`|upG9umcTaa	First of all don't straighten it before you curl it    Do it on clean hair, so wash your hair then put a curling cream in it to hold (Try KMS Curl up Control creme it's a bit pricey though) if your hair is fine and doesn't hold hairstyles well.  Then dry off with your hairdryer or leave to dry naturally if you have time.    Then section the hair and start at the back of your neck and work your way up and towards the front    I use a GHD to curl mine,    Take small sections about an inch wide and clamped down the iron at the roots then pull down and turn the iron at the same time as pulling it down then release at the ends and twist with your finger if you want.    Then spray with hairspray lightly (you don't want rock solid hair)  It's really easy to pick up     I hope this helped  Best of luck

They blend with the rest of your hair, giving you an overall softer and fresher appearance than the others, which is always good. :)    I think the bangs in the second picture are too harsh, if that makes sense. They don't look BAD or anything like that, but some people just can't pull them off as well as others.     But whatever you feel more comfortable with is the best choice for you. :)

This way, this "stale" version of the makeup stays put all day, even for swimming! and the coverage is great! <br>  <br>  as far as mascara, i love Telescopic by Loreal, it makes my lashes look amazing and stays put all day!|`|mFSPvoDJaa	Milani has some good cover up. and its only like 5 bucks! lol its amazing. its not powder but not liquid and works great.<br>  <br>  and mascara.. use the mabelline mascara in the pink and green bottle. professional makeup artists still use it. just get a better mascara brush. and it works great! :)<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|plLXVGNLaa	any stilla cover up!|`|8jY4JUw7aa	there is a good one called zuri|`|UvWoLnfhaa	matte mousse by maybelline. <br>  and i use define-a-lash lengthining mascara by maybelline. <br>  it stays on all day and doesnt make your lashes hard and stiff.|`|gz6IKATOaa	i use revlon and have tried loreal they are both good products and cover well.....for mascarra i love maybellein all their mascarras are awsom and do what is siad on the packaging im currently useinng the volume one but i switch around|`|BoXghyRvaa	Ohhhh I dunno about foundation but the best mascara I have ever tried is Maybelline's Colossal Mascara!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://deltacephei.web-log.nl/photos/uncategorized/2008/11/21/maybelline_colossal_mascara.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://deltacephei.web-log.nl/photos/unc...</a>
BvwkHEomaa	Honey, I got you :)    Take a cue tip, and every morning and night after cleansing dip it in some rubbing alcohol, then apply. It'll take a little while, but it's like magic.    But remember darling, rubbing alcohol is very bad for the skin, leaving a burning sensation and irritation; so only use it in moderation. And only on small areas of the skin. Less is more.      Good luck to you hun! I hope you find what your looking for.|`|yNgACBJvaa	don't bother using products, they don't actually work, might even make it worse, at least did to me    if you eat good foods, drink lot of water and exercises, as well as get 8hrs sleep you will see changes    don't stay awake at nights btw specially on computers :S|`|o7RGpeoIaa	Invest in a good 8 hr clearing gel. They're available at any department store.|`|JcP45OAkaa	well i do bridal modeling every week and its discusting to have even one pimple on my face and trying to look gracefull and flawless. but i found out if you dab toothpaste on the pimple alone it will suck out all the oil and makes it smaller and harder and then it would flake off and disappear. the question you might have now is how long does it take? well it could take from a couple of hours to a day. i sleep with it sometimes and i lllllllllllllllooooooove the results. good luck girl.
1b7N75Kraa	As a general rule:  Eyeshadow- are actually quite long lasting. Depending on brand. For a cheaper drugstore brand? Throw them out after 3-5 years. Or until they become more difficult to apply, cakey, etc.   Lip Gloss- also last a while. But to prevent bacterial infections, etc. Throw out after 2-3 years.   Foundation- 2 years MAX.   Mascara- have a very short life span because they dry out easily. Just avoid "pumping" the wand and throw out after a year AT MOST.   Blush- pretty long lasting. Treat like eyeshadow.|`|FklngtvCaa	http://ellegirl.elle.com/beauty/teen_bea...  ^ really helpful :)|`|VXcp8hvHaa	2 weeks  3 weeks  1 week  5 days  you are welcome : )|`|AdYiLoO4aa	1.

JwdU9nVBaa	no, i always get my hair thinned.  you can hardly even tell.  its a little thinner, but not much.  dont worry.|`|SR5zlAl8aa	ask a friend
msr6s66gaa	yeah its probably because it lightens up in the summer. try getting red highlights. as for the frizzy and dry try using sunsilk straightahead or curls (depending on your hair) or frizz ease products such as their shampoo and condition and frizz ease finish and shine to make your hair look silky|`|PTP8ptDbaa	i think its because lack of the sun! what you could do in the winter is just to try to pull your hair back into different types of hairstyles and add clips and it won't be so frizzy!  good luck!*

If you really want them both, have them both. But if you really need strangers to decide this for you, then you probably shouldn't be getting a tattoo at all.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	I like the concept of a fallen angel tattoo. The cross with wings would be nice, too, but the fallen angel has piqued my interest. Pics?|`|7BHSEIgXaa	get the one that will have the most meaning for you. i have 3 tattoos and each one means something to me. you don't wanna look back at them in 35years and regret what you had done|`|zi6Ipmfuaa	the cross with wings. that sounds pretty.|`|JafLyLYgaa	I have a cross with wings.

TfHdQHR7aa	Healthiest way is to gain muscle obviously, and itll make you look better too. Eat more protein especially, and carbs. Junk food will just gain weight on you bum & hips, basically all the places you DONT want fat. Also, if you gain weight by eating junky foods, you will have trouble losing it f you ever need to and itll cause other serious health issues. <br>  Id say go with working out to gain muscle!|`|tao83sDxaa	i had anorexia got down to 64lbs and almost died. i drank milk shakes, to get the extra calories in me. i also would eat whipped cream right from the can. what you need to do is get more calories in you than you are using up in a day. you will then start to gain weight.|`|iOYCCaoYaa	Well, I don't really know what else you would do, but I think that's just a good way to I guess. Good luck with your weight gaining. :s Happy late Valentines Day!|`|zgDxpqRsaa	its pretty weird that when you actually want to gain weight you cant<br>  <br>  well my advise to you is not to eat a whole bunch of junk food just eat more calories but eat healthy|`|2rPVLl49aa	Beer, beer, and more beer... as long as you are 21 of course.
esSq7NNTaa	hmmm....im wearing mine now and nothing like thats happened to me.  i think my mom hangs mine 2 dry after putting them in the machine.  like she doesntlet them machine dry them completely.    that might help!    hope it works!|`|2tx3eXtAaa	well i dont think that they will get any bigger you could wash them on warm to see if they shrink a little bit|`|LlC99CYqaa	the fabric was probably stretched in the washing machine . try putting them in the washer for less time and with warm water . then hang them to dry and iron the ends (ankle) .|`|cETQuE9waa	Follow the directions on the tag and it will tell you how to care for the jeans and how to wash them and dry them.
AA11299079	YES!!! You CAN return it!!!  I am a managerf at CVS and it can be returned with or without a receipt, used or unused.   If you don't want it, then return it.  Simple as that, you can say you had an allergic reaction or something....<br>  <br>  It doesn't get resold, correct... but we scan it out as damages and get credit for the merchandise...it's no big deal.<br>  <br>  If you have receipt, you get your full money back.<br>  <br>  If you don't have receipt, you get whatever the last sale price was, and the money gets put on a gift card.<br>  <br>  (And that goes for just about any product at CVS)|`|VN2wyTnFaa	If they've been opened, they won't. Drugstores aren't very lenient about that sort of thing, but department stores are. Hope that helped!|`|mBVXgRLFaa	no because they cannot re-sell it.|`|EhvWiRu5aa	No, definetly not.  They are considered tampered items.   You can only return them with a receipt and with packaging still intact.<br>  <br>  If you didn't like the product, the best thing to do would be call the company or get on the website and explain the situation.  Sometimes they will have you send them your receipt and they will refund your money or send you discounts/coupons.

The dark hair doesn't really suit your skin tone, unlike the lighter hair which really shows up your facial features and matches your skin tone.

Hope i helped you!|`|L0mJdWE9aa	2nd one|`|GSH0d2vfaa	first one. natural is better|`|frkJJpF9aa	The second one foshuree.  Your face is so pretty!  and the other two, sorta ruin it.  Not that they look bad.  Just, ya.  2nd one.|`|yaivipuDaa	second pic|`|FH8hgxpgaa	i think you look best in the first one i like the dark color the best.|`|CKvdyS6Saa	well i think you look nice in all 3 photos the first one i like it makes you look more mature and the 3rd one makes you look more sexier. so it would be between the 2 but if i had to pick one i would go for the 3rd picture because i like to have long hair and alot of men i have talked to feel the same way.|`|BboRJcX5aa	you look pretty in all! but im gonna have to go with the second one.|`|SbNQI33Jaa	Of the three, the color in the second picture is best for your skin and features. It lightens up your face and gives you a more youthful (but not in a kid-type way) look. But it's also a little too light.    I would suggest using a color similar to that, but in a richer/very slighty darker tone to give your hair more dimension.  :)
IlhQvPYMaa	Stay away from any kind of moisturizing shampoo! That is like death for oily hair. I know because have oily hair. I would try tea tree oil shampoo. You can get it at Sally's. Never but conditioner on your roots, that doesn't help anything just put it on the ends of your hair in minimal amounts. I don't really know of any product that helps keep your hair straight sorry. But be careful using the baby powder especially if you have dark hair, it doesn't always blend in well. Finally, if you wash your brush occasionally that will help too. Your brush will hold the grease that gets on it after you brush your hair.|`|6Oox1Iqzaa	Skip the conditioner. Or, condition with an oil-free product; work a<br>  minimal amount into the hair tips only, not the roots; and, apply it<br>  only as needed.<br>  <br>  Brush/comb hair briefly and infrequently. When working the brush or<br>  comb through the hair, avoid contact with the scalp. This helps<br>  prevent or limit the transfer of oil from the scalp to the hair.<br>  <br>  If you don't like these options, just experiement with different brands of shampoos. There's always one that will work for somebody!|`|lIpjuMTHaa	Well you can throw your head over and then put baby powder on your hands. Then run your fingers through your roots and on your scalp. That will soak up moisture. If you use Aveda hang straight, that will keep your hair straight for more than a day. Also, if you get a good straightener. I have curly hair that I straighten and mine stays for 2 days perfectly with my straightener.|`|FLFspMmeaa	dry shampoo?<br>  and baby powder works too, if you brush it through your hair.

Other than that I have loved mine. It didn't even really hurt that bad.    And having a tattoo close to your bikini line would be cute, the only downfall I could see to that is having a stranger - the artist- being so close to your, ahem, special place down there. Other than that bit of awkwardness, I couldn't see any downfall to that one, either.|`|4iQwI6D7aa	no actaully not really but dont do it on your stomach|`|ua9zB4vTaa	Those are both pretty common areas. I know several people with tattoos on their hip, and I have one at the nape of my neck. It wasn't painful and I really like the location. The hardest part is keeping it clean while showering for the first couple of days.. I had to wash my hair with my head tipped upside down so the shampoo wouldn't get in and irritate it.
lYr1zmQeaa	there's joann's fabrics that's a chain and some walmarts carry fabric but your best bet would just be to look it up in the phone book and look around, there are probably tons of $7.99 a yard places you just have to find them in your town because they're all different.|`|NjgvHbcYaa	maybe micheals or hobby lobby

7f217ccda43c76f8c4728b2cdf19d4dfaa	I use it. It's nice and it does make your skin softer. I don't dislike it but I don't swear by it. Neutrogena makes another thing thats similar to the wave but looks more like the Clarisonic one (that's $200!) and it's only $30 or so. I'd get that one instead.    http://www.target.com/Neutrogena-Healthy...    Hope that helps! Good Luck!|`|dasc2gM3aa	well in the commercial it shows all this foam it makes.....lie  it doesnt even foam its like using water. and the replacement pads are so expensive..  well its ok not great|`|gznGuH3iaa	well, of course in the commercial, it gets all foamy and looks like it would work wonders. i bought it and i guess its pretty cool since it vibrates but it didnt really work all that well.     you could get some clean and clear or neutrogena (sp?) face wash  also, i got the biore heating face clenser and it worked well. i could feel it clean my face. its only like $6 too. not too too expensive    hope this helps!|`|0UreaXS5aa	ohh it actually foamed for me, and did make my skin feel really soft, but as far as pimples went it was the same as any other stuff i've used..so its alright nothing super special..i wouldn't recommend it
zYWuX8H3aa	uhh Q-tips?
btPPw1FHaa	Well right now M.A.C has a collection called Blonde, Brunette, Redhead. It includes three seperate collections for well, blondes, brunettes and redheads so you should check that out. <br>  <br>  Don't by any really red lip products because they will make you teeth look yellow-er, but buy something with a blue undertone this will brighten your smile. :)<br>  <br>  Love Nectar lipglass, Shroom, Naked Lunch eyeshadows are great for highlighting brow bone, they compliment all skintones. For everday colors I suggest Satin Taupe and Amberlights. <br>  <br>  The best MAC eyeliners (in my opinion) are Smolder (Black) and Teddy (Brown). If you want something colored I suggest Bordeaux (A plummy purple) and Minted (a wintery green)<br>  <br>  Two great Youtubers to refer to when it comes to MAC are fafinettex3 and xsparkage. For reviews I suggest pinkiecharm. And there's this one account on youtube called ThePrettyCommitteeXO, its a group of seven popular teenaged makeup youtubers. (it just started this week but all it's members are amazing so check out their individual accounts too!)<br>  <br>  Eye Brushes:<br>  222 and 239 (shadow)<br>  209 (for cream liners<br>  <br>  Face Brushes:<br>  187 (great for blending powder), 129 (it's a powder and blus brush :D) and 194 (concealer brush) <br>  <br>  I recommend that you do not buy all MAC brushes, for things like concealer and liquid foundation you can just use those wedge sponges from the drugstore. <br>  <br>  For you foundation, powder and concealer there are several different textures go to the MAC store to find out which ones are best for you. <br>   Okay MAC help is done...lol<br>  ***<br>  Don't buy NARS lig glosses. They are super sticky and gross, same thing with Stila lipglosses. >.< But NARS eyeshadows are amazing and really expensive. a single is over $20 and duos are $32. But i don't suggest duos because they are paired poorly. <br>  ***<br>  If you ever need and eyeshadow base, DO NOT buy Urban Decay Primer Potion, the bottle is shaped in a away that you cannot get like 90% of the product and it can burn your lids if you have sensitive skin. Get Too Faced Shawdow Insurance instead because it comes in a squeeze tube, same amount of product and only $1 more. It's lighter (as in color) than the Urban Decay too. <br>  <br>  That's basically all i have to say...hope it helped.|`|iOYCCaoYaa	Go to the MAC site! That would be perfect! Happy late Valentines Day!|`|QeInCI4Raa	You need sephora.
N48qV69daa	Fossil, My fiance loves them! He has had this one for over a year, and he loves it so much! It is so easy to organize evrything. Here is a link with some of them, I get his wallets from The Buckle.    http://www.buckle.com/product/product.js...      They are a little pricey, around the $40.00 range, but totally worth it!      Good luck, that is a great gift, I know your Fiance will love it, especially in this brand.|`|dtt9r8Ehaa	Ferragamo is an excellent brand. The quality of their wallets are exceptional. The same thing goes for Gucci and Louis Vuitton. If you want a cheaper one with comparable quality, you can try Ralph Lauren too.|`|16a147d8164f962d7603e2ee7e357ff4aa	Personally, it dose not have to be something that is high class, just something that is not badly made and something that holds a lot.

But no,i've never been called ugly for real.But i feel for those who have been.I only can imagine that'd suck.I don't know how i'd react if someone called me ugly.I'll prolly freak out (in my inner self),but then be like:"Whatever,if it's what you think,then so be it."....Yeah........|`|aR6e3WLoaa	yeah but lets face it.  im hott,  [[joke]]  yeah ive been called ugly and yeah it hurt but oh well  truth hurts right??|`|MCN7gdI8aa	yeah, but i had just called the girl a slut so i dont know if it counts.|`|Puf7Y9BZaa	no|`|5HIHfRy2aa	I don't believe anyone is ugly because everyone is beautiful just that sometimes its covered by a weird sense of style or maybe badly applied make-up. As long as your confident and believe in yourself you can get through life...sometimes people really just want to hurt you but why let them when you can ignore them...If anyone ever called you ugly why would you listen to them..after all your destiny and fate has your perfect match and you'll find someone who will appreciate you for who you are and not only that but because they just adore you :)    I have been called ugly but mostly to joke around at least I take it like that and they mean it in that way because they laugh with me and tell me their kidding Anyway if someone calls you ugly you know their not a true friend.    If anyone calls you ugly with a bad intention its probably to help their EGO they usually want themselves to feel better because they feel they are "prettier"    Don't let anything get to you be strong and hold on to that shield!!!|`|8aixp5Rwaa	nope!|`|ojD1pAIsaa	Yahh  & it really hurt my feelingss :(
SR5zlAl8aa	idk ask u friend srry
hrqC3EV1aa	I would get the FHI 1" Ceramic & Tourmaline Platform Flat Iron for really thick or curly hair.    Since your hair is very thick, you should have a flat iron that gets really hot, and the FHI heats up to 450 degrees, (and it heats up in about 30 seconds!), and the ceramic plates and ion technology protect your hair from damage.    I would make sure to get one with 1" or larger plates so it will be quicker for you to straighten thick hair.    I bought my FHI flat iron from this site and I love it, they have a guide for choosing which flat iron is best for your hair type:  http://www.simplystraighthair.com/how-to...

JcP45OAkaa	try to eat and not worry about your weight in front of people , you could talk about wanting to gain weight and curves.   like " god i would love to get an ***" dont be mad even if you dont really want to . people who are anorexic are always worried about gaining weight and watch their weight no matter how tiny they are. and dont worry about what people think , really they make fun of you if you were fat and then wonder if u are sick if you are naturally skinny. pardon me but f^^^ them and what they think at least you know its bad and ur naturally thin. i was the same ur age and now i am a model . ull laugh at the end. i promise. good luck .|`|Z1OszV3raa	Yes, you're a bit smaller than normal, but as long as your healthy, that's okay!  If people say anything, they might be jealous because you're so thing.  Also, if you do not want people to say anything about your weight, don't talk about it (I don't know if you do, but just in case...)  If you talk about it, people may fixate on it.  Andd...when you're eating around other people, don't feel self-concious about what or how much you eat.  That's a classis sign of an anorexic person.  Hope this helps!|`|PzAHTXQeaa	Just make sure you provide all the nutrients that your body needs.

Just practice smiling and say 'Thanks for your question and concern', Then explain that it's your body type and that you eat healthy, and your doctor is ok with your size, that you have tried to gain a few pounds but your body seems preset to stay at its current weight. It's not bullying when someone is seriously concerned. It doesn't sound like someone would try intentionally bully you in front of someone's Mom. Research and read up on your body type and make sure you continue to stay healthy. Share your story with others that fitness and exercise is making you strong and mentally healthy.|`|Z3bjHCZpaa	my friend is just like you!!! does your mom or dad have the same figure as u? My friend is 13 and weights 85 pounds. She is NOTT anorexic either and people call her that and it annoys her too. I know shes not anorexic cuz i see her like every weekend and ive known her since i was born. She just eats slow and in small amounts. And also, shes complained to me that she tries to eat more but she doesnt gain any weight either. Shes also muscular. Wow u could be twins!! But, she has the same figure as her dad. Skinny and tiny. As long as you eat when your hungry and 3 times a day your fine. She actually has taught herself to not look at skinny as a bad thing, but as a good thing. She has gone shopping and bought clothes that flatter her pettite body. (shes also 00 too) Oh, and babydoll shirts can really flatter your small figure too!  hope i helpedd

Zh7QcGLtaa	Stop listening to people. Boys are some of the dumbest people on earth at your age. Just forget about them and forget they ever said rude things to and about you. Ultimaltey its your life and your probably never going to see them again. Live your life the way you want to. I know it's hard to do. I used to get called ugly. Turns out those boys had crushes on me. Lol Kinda weird right? Anyways stop crying over them. They are worth your time OR your tears. Ok sweetie?   Keep the good friends you have too. They'll be a big help. Oh and one more thing. Have CONFIDENCE!  |`|MZWdvdEwaa	Grow up and gain confidence.

And if u want to change ur looks...then try maybe doing something different with ur hair...wear some makeup(but remember not to over do it) and maybe change ur taste in clothes. ur friends can help u with this :D aeropostale, forever 21, hollister, american eagle, weat seal, urban outfitters, pacsun, old navy, charolette russe, etc. But like i said, it doesnt all matter who u r on the outside, but on the inside.  and i assure u things will change!

Usually when people say things like that, its only to make them feel better about themselves by bringing down others. Some things that you can do to boost your selfesteem is changing your hair, makeup, clothing, giving yourself a new look to boost yourself esteem will really create confidence. It worked for me! :)   Good luck, and remember you shouldn't listen to people who only bring others down, it doesn't matter what others think, its only what you feel about yourself :)    Hope i helped you!|`|WlFxAna8aa	maybe out up a picture?

AA11101361	Shaving makes your hair feel and appear slightly darker and more coarse.  When hair grows naturally, it has a nice tapered end.  When you cut that off, you are left with a blunt end that feels coarse.  Being the thicker part of the hair, it's also the darkest.  Shaving, won't change the texture of the hair permanently.<br>  I had laser hair removal done and I do it for a living.  Shaving is standard.  If the hairs are long, the laser will burn the hair and the treatment room will smell bad.  It could potentially smell really bad.  On different parts of the body burning hair smells different.  If you wax, you miss the point of laser since the laser needs that root to target.  If you use a depilatory, like Veet or Nair, you run the risk of a burn.  The reason your face feels sandy is the hairs are still growing out, it's stubble.  Even the hairs that the laser got still have to grow out.  <br>  You'll notice that the hairs are fewer and farther between probably after your 3rd session.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	First off, you're dealing w/ a very dumb old wives' tale.  Hair doesn't become "coarser" when you shave it, it simply shaves off the part that's been worn to a point over a short period of time.  And yes, if you had hair still standing up when they tried to laser, it would burn literally on the skin.  It's painful enough as it is, you don't want that.<br>  <br>  They'll do what they have to do, shaving again or not.<br>  <br>  I did try laser hair removal (not the face) and ended up being emergency-room burned.  Horrible experience, horrible pain.
imMsVkKhaa	At least you didn't take out the eye itself!<br>  <br>  A common question people ask is ' do eyelashes grow back ?'<br>  <br>  Well the good news is that - yes - eyelashes do grow back so you won't look strange for ages.<br>  <br>  In fact it is a fairly quick processes; it takes about four to eight weeks for an eyelash to fully grow back.<br>  <br>  You will be fascinated to know that the natural loss of eyelashes has a medical term for it, which is madarosis - sure you really wanted to know that!<br>  <br>  Anyway the bottom line - yes your eyelashes do grow back so just be patient and you should be fine in a few weeks - and be more careful with your beauty tools!|`|1B3ujUO4aa	my mom had this happen to her before but it was like the side of it.. and it didnt grow back... but idk<br>  <br>  mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090224144330AAdd6HD&cp=2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a>|`|Jp3cWTJiaa	It will, but it will take a while.... they are the slowest thing to grow... try getting false eyelashes until they grow back... or try using that new mascara that extends your lashes with the tube things....|`|tXs2meLPaa	Yes, of course they will, to help them grow faster and thicker apply castor oil before bedtime 3 times a week|`|defeBgqdaa	i hope so, i accidently ripped my eyelash off(yes painful)<br>  im still waiting to see if it grows back... i hope to god that is does|`|est5diCWaa	I dont know but i asked my mom and she said that they do grow in about 10 days.|`|JdwbaAIcaa	yeahh they will sooner or later but how did you accidentley cut them off lol???|`|IywWqqzAaa	yes they will lol|`|JBenOf9Daa	yes they will ive picked my eyelashes for over 20 yrs least they will do is grow back darker and thicker which is good thing right?|`|wOsxpIjYaa	I actually  had a in-grown eyelash.

imMsVkKhaa	The key with eyeliner is to use it sparingly. Some girls use loads of it which really highlights the eyes and makes you look a bit tarty - keep it subtle but so that it still accentuates the eyes for just the right effect.|`|Xl88AmV4aa	ok, here are some ways:<br>  first way- put some right on the outside of your bottom lid, and only from outside of your eye to the middle, then, smudge it a tiny bit so it doesn't look like one thick black line.<br>  Second- Put the liner on the bottom inside of your lids all the way<br>  third- do the first way or the second, and then put some on your top part of your eye.<br>  I do this all the time, and it looks awesome! good luck!<br>  -Skye:)|`|cfkuPoMaaa	Great question. So many girls don't know how to apply eyeliner! Only put eyeliner on you upper lid right next to your lash line (for a fuller appearance). During the day do not apply black. Brown is always a safe bet.  At night if you want a more dramatic look black is good.  By putting it only on your upper lid it will make your eyes look huge (a good thing). <br>   Good Luck!|`|YaFKI2lxaa	Idk, do you have some pictures?|`|8rYvWPGVaa	what i do is put it on my inner top lid, then also on the top lid, trace along your lash line to make them look really defined. for bottom, just put it on your inner lid & smudge. but use very little amounts for your bottom lids

AA11101361	No, it's not organic.  Buy honey at a framer's market or health food store for organic honey.<br>  Honey has anti-bacterial properties and has been used for centuries on wounds.  There is a possibility that it will help your acne, but you are just as likely to get rid of your acne if you cleanse twice a day with a gentle cleanser, use an alcohol free toner, apply benzoyl peroxide to your spots (pile it on at night so you have white spots on your face), apply an eye cream and then apply an oil free moisturizer.  You can buy Neutrogena products that meet these requirements.  Honey will do nothing for bags under your eyes.

AA10849332	best thing for ANY piercing is to do sea salt soaks. in the case of a helix piercing, you should be doing this at least twice a day.    mix 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt per 8 oz of water.    dial is ok...but if you're going to use soap, using something like Provon or Satin (which are antimicrobial) is better.    there is also something called H2Ocean that you can spray on that will work in place of the sea salt soaks. You can buy it at many piercing studios and it is also available at Hot Topic and Spencer's.    this should have been covered in your aftercare sheet...              make sure that you never clean a piercing with peroxide, alcohol or triple antibiotics (like bactine) they are too harsh. They irritate and dry out the piercing site and slow doan healing.  also never use anything that is a cream...like neosporin. it is not meant for use on a puncture wound (what a piercing is) and will give dirt a place to collect as well as cut off oxygen to the piercing site......|`|bAYVSfdJaa	Sea salt soaks, or dye and fragrance free soap.|`|Au4gWgEiaa	Antibacterial or unscented soap works.

SOdIlEi9aa	I got my (bottom) lip jus 5days days ago. At first my mom didnt like the idea of me getting it done. Then i kept bugging her about it until she finally gave it. The only reason why my mom didnt want me to get it done was because she thought it would get infected. But mine has been healing really well, but it all depends on you the person. So i would suggest you do your reasearch to put your moms mind at ease.     Or if you want to be really rebellious then just get it done. Cause she can't do anything about it if you've already gotten it done. Which i was just going to do anyway but thankfully my mom gave in & let me get it done.    Hope this helps|`|iP9saNlBaa	Well, I just went and got mine done even though my mom didn't want me to. I don't recommend you do that though. Just tell her that yeah, you might regret it later...

ucpMOO6Uaa	I have a tough skin regime:   1. Use face cleansing wipes to remove dirt so It cant get trapped under the moisturiser   2.

Then face cleansing wipes again to get rid of any dirt that may have transferred from your hands to the moisturiser   4. then finally i use a facial scrub to open my pores to let them breathe.

Don't be shy about what you're wearing. You're going to have to wear sparkly bright things that are going to stick out. There is no room for being shy.     2. When you're going to a party, dress lightly. You're probably going to get really, really hot. So don't wear jackets and layers and layers of clothing, unless you want to smell.     3. Try wearing baby tees, or bright neon stuff from the eighties. (for shirts, that is)     4. Wear brightly colored, sparkly makeup and eyeliner. But don't overdo it, you don't want to look like a whore.     5. Wear a backpack. Not like a school bag, but a stuffed animal backpack. Probably something from a cartoon. Toys-R-Us is a great place to go to.     6. For bottoms, during the day it's a good idea to wear tight skinny jeans or (for girls) Capri pants, but skirts are always good, too.     7. Choose any type of shoes (just not flip-flops or anything like that). Stay away from basketball type of shoes (use common sense here.)     8. Kandi is a good idea, too.

You may even change your mind about wanting it later anyways.|`|QPQdWsTOaa	You dont HAVE to take it out, most people put medical tape or a band-aid over the piercing, just so it wont get hit/ripped out.

After that maybe you should hang up side down and brush your hair from the inside out and do it by sections. When your  done,squeeze the remaining water out from the tips, because you should always brush downwards, and then brush it the style you usually put your hair. Then your done.

You're going to need to get a job to afford the things you want (trust me. I'm the biggest girly-girl on the planet. It's not a cheap lifestyle.)    2.) Find/copy a teen celebrity; one who's style appeals to you most. Possibly one that may even slightly resemble you. Study their clothes, accessories, makeup.    3.) Find your body type. Apple, pear, rectangle... etc. Study online or in magazines for attire that is most suiting.    4.) Invest in some magazine subscriptions. These are your bibles. (Pay close attention to the pictures.) I suggest; Cosmo Girl, Cosmo, Seventeen, Glamor, Vogue, & Teen Vogue. Often in a couple of these magazines they have examples of makeup styles.    5.) Makeup is difficult and awkward at first. But once you get used to it, it becomes second nature. Practice, practice, practice! Start with something simple like blush, foundation and mascara (each has their own specific way of application depending on your face shape.) Then when comfortable with the basics, move onto something more difficult like eyeliner, and eyeshadow. Practice sweetheart. I can't stress this enough. Find a look you want in a magazine and rip it out, tape it to the side of your mirror, and just go to town! (And rememeber certain makeup colors go's with certain skin tones. )    6.) Find your face shape. I.e. are you an heart shaped, square, oval shaped, or round faced person? Base your makeup off this.    7.) Be nice. You'll attract more flies with honey than vinegar. And there's just something about a kind and pretty girl.    8.) NEVER buy something just because it looks nice on the hanger. TRY IT ON FIRST.     9.) Get your hair and eyebrows done. Pain leads to beauty. Get your nails done. (I don't suggest fake nails though. They ruin your real nail, and are difficult to function with if you play sports.)    10.) And remember darling... make sure you're comfortable. Physically and mentally. You don't just go overnight from Nike's to heels. Find what suits you. Don't forget who you are.         PS: I guarantee that people will be a bit shocked. So get ready for attention. It'll be annoying at first, (especially if it's from *****'s) but sooner or later people will get used to it. Good luck love, tell me how things go :)

xzoURbZXaa	you need to get a hair cut. go to your stylist, bring this picture. your hair won't look EXACTLY like it, but thinning it out on the bottom and layering it will give it similar volume on top and wispiness on bottom that taylor momsen has. ask if they can cut your hair with a razor instead of scissors. the razor gives you that soft, shaggy, wispy look that taylor has. when you style your hair, wait till it dries, then spray all over with some sort of texturizing spray (try sunsilk waves of envy, it won't make your hair wavy, but it will seperate the strands and make your hair more piecy).|`|uR5aNpHGaa	add layers and thin out the bottom a bit  and it probablly look better if you did cut your bangs like that|`|RNfygDqsaa	there is thinning products for hair    go to your local hair place ask ask for layers.     you also will need to tease you hair on the top layer to make it taller looking and bigger.     then straiten your lower layers and that will sure give you the look.    -answer mine  Maddi|`|uD7zgtcfaa	Ask to get your hair feathered and a bit pointed to the back. mine looks just like that but longer!

This also looks like a razor cut, not sure.|`|CuH55g5daa	First thing's first... I believe in order to get that style you'll have to get a haircut and layer your hair to make it thinner. Layering is basically what it sounds like, cutting your hair at different lengths from top to bottom to give the same length for less volume.     You then get a hair straightener, and depending on your budget you can get various types. The more expensive the faster they get hot and better they work. You can style your hair however you want and can even curl in the ends a bit around your face. The only drawback is that you have to straighten your hair every time after you take a shower, but once you get good at it it'll take about 30 mins or less each time.    Good luck!

It's not really cool to steal others designs though. Nothing wrong with getting inspiration. But always better to take a design you like to your artist and get him to work out something inspired by it but different, unique to you.|`|8THz1sp9aa	You can always go to your artist and tell them you want something resembling 'life, laugh & love" artists are very creative and i'm sure they'll come up with something you'll love. Or you could go to deviantart.com and type in the search 'life tattoo' 'laugh tattoo' & 'love tattoo' and see what comes up to give you ideas. Just please don't use that exact tattoo for yourself, yes people do enjoy sharing their work but they do not appreciate people stealing their ideas. You can print out a few photo's that you like and take them to your artist and say I would like something similar, your artist will draw you up something and if you like it, get it. if you don't like it then don't be afraid to tell them what changes you'd like to be made. good luck.|`|dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	Here are some I hope you like!!!!    http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_in6GFd1Fm_0/R9...    http://www.jammadesigns.com/media/Live.L...    http://www.livelaughlovetk.com/LIVELAUGH...    http://www.blissweddingsmarket.com/store...    http://www.goodmediacommunications.com/z...    http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images...    http://www.tuesdayteez.com/images/live_l...|`|YLarhhLJaa	the best way of describing what you want is getting a tattoo of a nice bird flying in the sky. Trust me that is really tight.|`|ua9zB4vTaa	I'm assuming you mean "live laugh love" and no, you're not going to be able to find that easily on the internet. My suggestion would be to go to a place that does tattooing and look through a book of theirs that has different fonts, then get the artist to draw it up for you. If not, try finding a friend that can draw to help you out.|`|eef643f03add597f1771608e89d94eaeaa	i love that quote and have it on my foot    its soo cute and i love it. i get lots of compliments on it too.

T5FDeDYDaa	1. congrats       2. lol your hair is a nice length already     but I would try parting it in the back the back has a little more body to it and your bangs and the rest and just be wispy|`|yNgACBJvaa	you just wanted to show the pic in pajama, that's all.    dream on b*tch, i dont go for girls with bad teeth|`|qkNyiOrxaa	you should keep curling your hair, it looks natural and healthy.    if you are still bored try getting it cut short like a bob it would look cute|`|WlFxAna8aa	I reckon bob, thinned out and possibly full fringe.|`|inUmxglTaa	well first, your sooooo pretty (:  i honestly love your hair like it is.  it looks good wavy also.  but put mouse in it, or part it to the side more!  i really think you could pull anything off (:|`|tA1kxKYgaa	the curly hair is really cute :) have you considered going paler blonde? or a red? good luck|`|g1xY5l2Gaa	it looks cute curly you could play around with tht|`|uMUMVZPoaa	I think it looks really cute curly!!|`|EnYLhQajaa	Ummm, I thing you should crimp it, or curl it with a small hair curler. That would look good. I think blond is your colour. Have you tried dark red? Like, auburn?|`|oqD5Txusaa	it looks pretty curled ;p but use hair protection sprays|`|VYJp1Tifaa	U LOOK REALLY GOOD WITH CURLY HAIR AND TRY TO GROW IT OUT PLEASE. the last two pics looked the best|`|N1LYWbHFaa	your hair looks nice curly
KeDM1srLaa	you can decrease the purple-ness by lifting your feet up high for a while....    this makes the blood flow back away from you legs...    i know this works for me cuz i am pretty pale and have the same problem...    try to increase the circulation by moving your legs regularly even when you are sitting...|`|cd37yLuZaa	unfortunately, u cant make veins go away hun|`|PzAHTXQeaa	Try make up, tanning or legwear.|`|Xw2JFBVpaa	can't be fixed. better you should join  rap group. and remember --- you can't spell crap without rap.|`|Y5ruAxuFaa	bronzer  is amazing! but the whole purple situation happens to me too there really isn't much you can do except to wear lots of layers to help with that..
AA10378447	Definitely a very trendy hairstyle that will not look good on everyone, nor will it look good in all situations (e.g. a business environment).|`|EncopDCmaa	its cute and edgey.    HARD to pull off though!|`|jMffH1kzaa	I think it looks very good on this person, but I don't think it would look good on someone like me.|`|98LDN0Quaa	i think it looks good on her...do you have a picture of yourself....for example..it wouldnt look good on a paris hilton type|`|XG4TAjcCaa	I don't really like it.|`|JLP5IhFDaa	Its cool but its prolly best to have a really feminine face and small to medium frame. So if you do, right on!|`|eXYldVRUaa	That's a very attractive style.  But it depends on how your face is shaped.|`|gLSpOsDraa	sorry but that's really ugly|`|Wp3byy0zaa	I like it, it's cute especially if you have the right hair.

4uKbpwVtaa	hairspray. and use a hair straightener to twist and flare sections of hair and after you are done with each section, get a round brush and twist your hair around it again and comb through. :]|`|P9inKWOaaa	****. not washing my hair defo keeps a good oil lurking|`|PYArO59naa	use a straightener and at the ends of your hair, flip it out and then spray it with hairspray. to get the shiny look, make sure you have clean hair before you do it lol|`|1eUe9BkOaa	You already managed to do that... :P|`|vqlkecS5aa	OMG ITS ALICE CULLEN! AHHHH! |`|PTpGJ60Daa	I would use a straightener, i have thin hair and it gets staticy, and frizzy very easy. I tried flipping my hair out with a skinny hair straightener and I found that that works the best!|`|c2cfafa045c1cfca6abe9c25b6c12b32aa	Round brush and blow dryer use a diffuser to help keep the frizzies down|`|ZSblTwwaaa	Style your hair as normal, then add the tiniest bit of sculpting wax (I like garnier) to you hand, put it into your hair, then flip out the ends.|`|OZy2kj0zaa	WHOA!!!   you look really familiar. seriosly.    anyway, you blow dry your hair with a round brush. and if you want, you could use a curling iron, flip the ends out, and use spiking gel.|`|dnMvibooaa	apply some gel. then flip it with a barrel brush while you blow dry it.
vLZlPGEWaa	Your hair has flyaways (due to static), it's not frizzy.  This might sound strange, but do you know those fabric softener sheets (like Bounce, but i'm not sure if they have it in the UK)?  They work wonders for flyaways; just smooth it over dry hair, and you're good to go.|`|UC8H6MdNaa	i find john frieda has good range i use frizz ease secret agent after washing my hair john frida hair serum b4 straightning then serum spray to finish but you can get own brand hair serum which you get as they really help|`|CaCTQ3Qbaa	Try using kerastase oleo relax, it isn't the cheapest however it is the best at taming frizzy hair.|`|tgCNwQ2Saa	I just bumped into an article and here's the link, this might really help you a lot...  http://ezinearticles.com/?Combat-Frizzy-...|`|AhpS6XJnaa	I found that when I had long hair that I had a lot of frizz too!  The best thing for this is Panten ProV perfect curls, now that may sound crazy that I'm recommending a Curl defining shampoo, but it actually really does a really good job in relaxing the hair, and eventually kinks and frizz and even curls will ease away!
XuFH8oNfaa	Nice taste! I've already done a bit of searching and have found that ring on TONS of hot fashion sites... it looks like snakes are in!!! So you may get lucky in a month or 2 and find one similar in a store at the mall. For now, try searching "boucheron" or "vivre' inspired gold snake ring... I've had some good luck finding cheaper similar version of designer items that way... it just takes time for them to hit the market! In the meantime, I'll keep an eye out and add info if I find anything ;)    EDIT: I did find this... still a little pricey and not exact but you get the idea!  http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?ref...    This one is def more affordable, not quite the same design but getting closer!!!  http://www.girlprops.com/RetailScience/p...|`|iQZpv42raa	try this  http://cgi.ebay.com/New-Womens-REAL-925-...|`|18afBRSXaa	go to www.claire's.com   they have lotts of rings and im sure they have a double ring like that. In fact, it will probably be only like, 12 dollars. Or instead of claire's, go to Charloutte Rouse. Its in The florence KY mall.|`|uYpYgl00aa	try claires or Icing by claires|`|lSKaujuQaa	Wow you have good taste. try cragslist or ebay or claires.|`|ZEvtVkuuaa	Vivica A Foxx has a REALLY nice collection. Visit her store. No dissapointment there!
OuaUAAZlaa	too bad cause theyre actually cheapest at hot topic; make sure to call all hot topic stores in your area to see if they have the shoes (if you havent already). also, i think they might be able to ship shoes for free from store to store. anyway:    http://www.converse.com/index.aspx?mode=...

Nwm1JZNXaa	Yes.  You can go and get them waxed or threaded at a salon.  They come out really well that way and they can shape them nicely for you.  At the place where I get my nails done they charge around $7 for an eyebrow wax.  It doesn't hurt too bad either, just like taking off a bandaid.|`|t5yRrYGaaa	You'll have to go to a salon and ask for threading or waxing.|`|WULMN1tCaa	Dont thin them!

Those are all supermodels/actresses and they all look stunning.  Im not trying to change your choice but if you really want to get them thinner get them waxed professionnally.     Good luck!|`|4sVB0efkaa	Yeah, use a shaver to shape your eyebrows. It grows back quick, but it's way easier than plucking
24cUKZDgaa	Liquid gets kind of annoying to put on,  get the "self sharpening" eyeliner ,   the kind that you slide up ?|`|1EOf9DbQaa	pencil liquid is to messy|`|nzCxfFNyaa	liqid so much prettyer and easer to put on but u hav to hav a steady hand       =]|`|83419326a8e663feecc64bea718f1bc0aa	I have both but I find it easier to put on eyeliner with the pencil. Liquid eyeliner works best for the upper eye lid.|`|ZaxpQSO5aa	I find that pencil doesn't really show up, maybe I'm just bad at applying it, and liquid takes a lot of practice, and is easier to screw up. I agree with whoever said that self sharpening 'crayon' type eyeliner. Its the only kind that I find stays on the water line. Almay specifically. Good luck!|`|Zh7QcGLtaa	Pencil is easier to use but it depends on what kind of look your going for. Especially if you ever want to achieve winged eyes. (gorgeous) Then your gonna need liquid. But pencil is easier like I said.|`|0QE1nM0Haa	Well the pencil depends on the brand if its a cheap one it might be a little hard I used to have a $1.00 one and I had to press really hard and it hurted my eye I bought a $15 one and its called a soft touch pencil and its really easy to put on and its nice and dark :D    The liquid one is cool because its really dark but sometimes its hard to apply you have to make a really good line.|`|DRFXicyyaa	i find liquid eyeliner to be easier to put on but thats just me because if you get a cheap eyeliner pencil it won't glide on as easily.|`|uZcubIrzaa	pencil is easier to use !|`|3PYBSFSyaa	I like liquid because once it dries, it doesn't smudge and its easier to apply thin or thick lines.|`|7BHSEIgXaa	for the top i love liquid it goes on sooo smooth and for the bottom i love pencil|`|EP34SN5baa	pencil  its easier to put on, its cheaper, and if you make a smudge, its easier to wipe off|`|DoWqrcQUaa	Pencil, easier to use and if your hand isnt steady, liquid can get into your eye and you'd hafta use a q-tip to get it out...it hurts O.e|`|vCXzfhTpaa	Buy both, they are used for different looks.  Pencil is much easier to put on and can be used for everyday normal look.  You can use liquid everyday as well but you can also use it to intensify a look or add more designs to your eye make up or swirls at the end. You've got a lot more freedom of expression w/ liquid but it can be difficult to get a hang of and you might not want to wear it on your lower lash line cuz it gets into your eyes fairly easily.|`|Ac9AzRHRaa	liquid is better and last longer for above your eye  pencil works better all around    i prefer liquid, but you should get both if you can|`|CqLo8nk2aa	Even though liquid can be annoying at times, and is more expensive its really worth it, it lasts all day, and it creates a bolder shade, but if you have a very short patient level than pencil would be the better choice, its easier to use!    Hope i helped!|`|SgKFNuHAaa	i would say the liquid eyeliner because once its dry it would stay all day...and you can re apply it and have darker lines without any smudges..with pencil eye liner..yea its easier but you may need to re apply it like every hour if you want the line to look dark..|`|1b7N75Kraa	Pencil is A LOT easier to apply. But smudges easily and can be annoying to apply esp. if you have a blunt end. But its great for first-timers. Great make up looks that can be achieved? Smoky eyes, soft subtle eyes, etc.   Liquid is a little bit trickier to apply but the end result looks smooth, fine, and clarified. Its a bit more dramatic and has a lot more staying power. Great make up looks that can be achieved? Cat eyes and other equally dramatic looks.   So its up to you!|`|tIF6IfRTaa	for me pencil. i find it way easier|`|scyvsf7Eaa	Well, use pencil, but only for the bottom...    for the top, use a twisting eyeliner stick. they're much, much, better.    its like liquid eyeliner, but in pencil form. if your having troubles with it, take a q-tip with some eyemake up remover on it, and shape it the wy you want.    works absolutely perfect for me.|`|VCfk5ZQbaa	Depends on the value of them both.  It's hard to find a good pencil eyeliner- the best I've tried is this one:    http://www.covergirl.com/products/produc...    and Liquid eyeliner is hard to find, too.  the good stuff, anyways.  It flakes a lot.  This stuff doesn't flake or smear and its the best I've ever used:  http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...    But pencil is much easier to put on, both are worth splurging on.    xoxo  caseyy.??|`|feb7143192e9c7ccb1a8b16f5fcd9677aa	pencil is easier for me to put on  but i know some people that are really good at putting on the liquid eye line  but its ultimately up to you  have u tried both?|`|a60O1sS8aa	F/13    It all depends on your eye shape and color.  If your eyes are blue or green, it will look gothic.  If your eyes are brown or gold, it'll look REAAALLY nice.    pencil is cheaper and is easier to put on, but liquid looks nicer, especially when you make a wing. (;    I have brown eyes and what I do is I put liquid eyeliner on the top and pencil eyeliner on the bottom and it looks really nice.    The thing about liquid eyeliner is you have have a really steady hand otherwise it'll look hooker trashy. Also, you might wanna start by using brown-- its less harsh and in my opinion, looks better.    Good luck!|`|9GDBpl8Faa	I think pencil is easier to put on. But whichever you prefer is really what you should buy.|`|VpxQ7Du9aa	pencil!!!!  liquid, it smears, once i put it on 4 fun, and it smeared all over my face, it was aw-full!!!!  use pencil!!!|`|I1tnVvVGaa	get the pencil, so much easier....the loreal one is great|`|kW371HVMaa	pencil
NwhEMuAUaa	shampoo and condition it frequently|`|W50zzBQoaa	omg ok use garnier fructise hair serum. it helps with allllll of that. u can use as much as u wanna and it wont be getting all greasy on ya. and itll take care of all tha static. its great with straightening. always make sure u wash out all of your conditioner thought. maybe thats the prob.  but use the serum before blow drying hair, before straightening hair, and after strightening hair. hope i helped! :]    heres a link for the serum:     http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...|`|ozwLZwXeaa	Sometimes when you straiten your hair every day you have fried it.

7RZWVQ0daa	dang i love answering this question!!!    Girls can be really hot with small waists and a tiny figure but it can also be extremely hot when they are a little bigger beacause it makes there butt bigger which is very sexy. Dont worry i dont think girls need to have a perfectly skinny body i like a wide variety of girls, but dont get to big, guys notice that, obviously wont tell u though (unless they are complete jerks) if ur a little bigger then the really thin girls try showing off ur butt and or breasts more, sometimes its nice to have more to love, ive seen plenty of girls that arent pencil thin and are very sexy.|`|HvxKb4gIaa	skinny girls can be curvy, too!    on average, i think guys prefer those who are in the middle, not too big, not too small, but there are those guys who are extreme. you can't please everybody! :]|`|392052a3dbd6d94cc65100310f44fccfaa	I know a few chubby chasers....But,most guys over here and that i know,like the skinny,lean toned girls.|`|kS7JqjPzaa	MORE meat for me.

Zi5JF9cNaa	Man I feel your pain!!  Nothing is cut the same anymore..even in the same brand and style!  I have  jeans from 36 to 40 inches waists and tee shirts from large to 2X....you just have to try it on or buy something you already have and know it fits!  I have noticed a lot of jeans are made be the same manufacturer..say levis, but they are made in different parts of the world and fit different....|`|jH8hIB0kaa	Even within the same brand, they can be cut differently. The only way to know for sure is to try one on. When you find the style and fit that you like, get the style number off of the tag. Google the style number and order the same one. If you do not, it costs, and is a lot of trouble to send them back.

But from that picture I can't tell where your hair is parted, and to make your hair look like that, it has to be parted pretty far to the side. You could even cut them yourself. just comb some hair forward, wet it, cut it on an angle, and sweep them to the side and let them dry that way. I cut mine and they look just like the picture.|`|r1KTZBkraa	i dont think that you should get any  but if you were i think you should get staright across  then if you dont like it just turn them into side bangs|`|cd37yLuZaa	ur hairs pretty as is, but if you realllly want them try a thin side bangs|`|90qBWGmJaa	I like it without.|`|4aGoWKtEaa	Get straight bangs it will look good especially because of your hair type.

Even a little eye liner or light eye shadow (depending on your age).  I don't know if you're wearing any make up in the picture to begin with, but if not, it looks like you've got a nice natural blush, so you're lucky :)  You could try some cover up if you feel like you have under eye circles (though I can't really tell in the picture).  You have really nice eyebrows though, and a really good face structure.  Over all, you're pretty, so don't worry too much!!!|`|EnYLhQajaa	hahaha, I love the first answer.

MTcs2pKwaa	Get a dress that is long sleeves and goes slim down.Not puffy,but slim.The dress,i would say,would be an inch above your knee and wear black tights.Oh and the dress,like the french wear black a lot,can be black and sparkling sliver.Also,wear some black mini heels or sliver flats.For the barbue party,wear some converse shoes(low-cut and black with white shoe laces),some dark blue skinny jeans,and a black T-shirt with a logo on it(like maybe "Don't touch me or you'll get burned" or"would you like some fries with that shake").I and you could maybe buy a black arepostle jacket(long sleeves).HOPE I HELPED!

Its probably really hard to get out. Try switching hair product and really scrub your head to make sure you get all the product out. if it is lice, comb through your hair bit by bit and scrape the lice out. have someone help you too. shampoo it once, comb through it and add lice removing product and then get back in the shower and scrub and rinse ur hair again before combing through it and removing hte lice. i know its a pain in the booty (lol) but when i had lice it took me about an hour or so to get rid of it. also make sure you wash all ur pillows and blankets, anything that touched your hair and throw out all hair accessories and hair brushes/ combs.

You can't fix it yourself.|`|ioACLKdxaa	Lice eggs (called nits). These look like tiny yellow, tan, or brown dots before they hatch. After hatching, the remaining shell looks white or clear. Lice lay nits on hair shafts close to the skin's surface, where the temperature is perfect for keeping warm until they hatch. Nits look sort of like dandruff, only they can't be removed by brushing or shaking them off. Unless the infestation is heavy, it's more common to see nits in a child's hair than it is to see live lice crawling on the scalp. Small, red bumps or sores from scratching. For some kids, the irritation is mild; for others, a more bothersome rash may develop. Excessive scratching can lead to a bacterial infection (the skin would become red and tender and may have crusting and oozing along with swollen lymph glands). If your doctor thinks this is the case, he or she may treat the infection with an oral antibiotic.|`|50aa3f03b6ffc4934dbfc91313d43605aa	its most likely to be dandruff...you have to keep your scalp moister so that the dandruff could go away...|`|aZJi677kaa	They could be lice eggs if they are sticking to your hair.  Dandruff would move away when you brush at it.Sometimes the white things are the eggs, or nits, and lice treatments have a comb that you have to use to comb the eggs out of your hair in addition to using a lice shampoo treatment.  They don't just go away like the lice which will die when you wash with the treatment, because the eggs are not hatched yet.  I work in schools and have had to help with lice in kids' hair for years.

If you want to be original, you:    - Won't ask strangers to give you tattoo ideas just because you want a tattoo.    - Will go away and study the beautiful artform that is tattooing before you adorn your body with something I would bet a lot of money you know nothing about.    - Will wait until something comes along that you don't want to get tattooed, you NEED to get tattooed. That might be in a month, a year, a decade. Don't look out for it, it'll just hit you. Someday something will happen in your life that means so much to you that you need to symbolise it or pay tribute to it on your skin.    - Won't end up like all the millions of other trashy teenagers with random pictures tattooed on them that they thought were cute and didn't hold any meaning for them.|`|ua9zB4vTaa	This is a pretty individual thing, so I don't think anyone is going to have an idea that you really like.

gmhwPZY3aa	haha i'm a brunette, blue eyes, really pale.   first, i put on concealer under my eyes. i leave it for about a minute so that it has time to 'dry' a little. then i put on foundation with a foundation brush. i don't load it on tho, i try to use as little as possible. then i use a black eyeliner and put it on top and bottom, but in the inner part of my eyes, not above the lashes. then i put on 2-3 coats of mascara on top and kinda sweep it onto the bottom a little. then i put on a powdery bronzer with a bronzer brush and i put it on my cheeks and work my way out. then i sweep some on my nose and a little on my forehead. finally, i add some lip gloss. it's not too much, but less is more.   hope it helps!! good luck!! =)|`|c3Dhkvvoaa	heyy. okay, so it sounds like your wearing a considerable amount of makeup on a regular basis. what kind of foundation do you use? if it's heavy, you may want to cut down on it, only using it on the places you really need it. i find that a light liquid foundation is great if your skin is dry, but a more powdery compact is better for oily skin.  anyways, i have the exact same face as you except for the brown hair (i'm blonde) so i think you should go for black eyeliner on the top lids, and nothing on the bottom. then add some lengthening mascara.  also, you may not want to use THAT much eyeshadow on a regular basis- try natural-ish tones, maybe with some shimmer if you like that.  i usually just wear some tinted moisturizer, with a little bronzer on top and some mascara and maybe eyeliner. but thats just me. :)  hope i helped|`|n5wXTZFGaa	Eye Shadow:  You'll look best in lavender, camel, medium brown, bronze or gold shades of eye shadow. Choose one shade only to use at a time and apply it all over eyes, from lash-line to brows.    Mascara:  Apply one coat of clear or black mascara.    Lip Color:  Clear gloss is always fresh and looks pretty on you for day. For a hint of color, try sheer glosses in shades of light brown or raisin (brownish-red).    Special Occasions:  Choose a glittery eye shadow in bronze or gold and finish eyes with one to two coats of black mascara. Make lips shine with a clear or sheer brownish-red lip gloss..    Keep up with the foundation and concealor! ;)    Hope I helped!!!! :) Good luck you!!!!!!!!!!

dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	Getting it trimmed regularly is really the only thing to make it grow faster and plus healthier. I also do a cold water rinse before I  get out of the shower to close the pores of the hair to prevent damage. Deep condition twice a week. I use aussie 3 minute miracle. To keep it healthier which will help it grow, avoid over brushing, over heating, and pulling it back (it can cause it to fall out). Stay hydrated. It does wonders for hair and skin! Good Luck!!!!|`|g2tGislaaa	Use the mane & tail shampoo from the grocery store it horse shampoo but it will make your hair grow faster.|`|AkenZUotaa	when you shampoo, massage your scalp really well.|`|wnOHdpCNaa	Im trying to grow mine outt too.  things that help me are Vitamin B, i take one everyday  it will also give you healthy skin.    The more you use heating products, the less it will grow.  I still use mine, but only when i have too, if im not doing anything  i dont bother.* Make sureee you use heating protecters!    and i know it doesnt make sense, but cutt your hair about every six or 8 weeks everytime you cut off your split ends it will grow about an inch:)    But like all beautiful things, it takes time.  so be patient!    good luck!

Yahoo Answers shouldn't have to decide for you. Its your stomach, and your choice. Have fun! =)|`|xM3iQwhaaa	should be alright...    my overweight friencd has one, so i think you can too
QlnTwifraa	Its bad for you, your lips get dependant on it. So while it does seem like its working, and stopping them cracking/chapping, when you stop using it they get really dry again. You should use a lip balm without petroleum as that is what drys the lips out.|`|b4oD8ADIaa	its great. wear a thick coat when you go to bed...  it helped me a ton|`|G8Rg9nsqaa	its really good!|`|YB3akykhaa	i use it sometimes not to often and it works wonders for me! but everyone is different.|`|mMvEEZ3oaa	its not bad at all   who told you that|`|QuQioUd7aa	never heard that it was bad,   i use it, all my friends to doo,  never caused a problem lol|`|zDf186Xyaa	If your going to kiss your partner who has rough lips, then use vaseline.|`|VVgRoDMtaa	yeah i use at night time before i go to bed and i will have pink, plump lips in the morning.|`|TLux1kbraa	good for your lips, bad for the environment because it's made from petroleum|`|uQ316P2Saa	Well i put vaseline on my lips everyday and i havent had chapped lips in years :)|`|fafd36bfe7e438c0ce232689c8a5a135aa	depends what you are going to use them for|`|8Ml5DzJraa	i been told it's really good so i use it all the time and it's the best!|`|wnk4erYgaa	vaseline is alright. But my old boss once told me to use regular cooking oil on my lips when i was working one night. And it worked like instantly.|`|KuNEDHFzaa	It's good for your lips! I use it all the time. It's just like chap stick..but like a gazillion times better in my opinion!|`|Nwm1JZNXaa	I know so many people who use that on their lips, so I don't think that it's bad for you.  Maybe check webmd.com if you're really worried, but I know of many people who do that, so I doubt it will hurt you.|`|CDFz2Yjvaa	No. It is amazing! If you put on a lot before you go to bed and after it will so take care of chapped lips. Best I lip product I have ever tried|`|UC8H6MdNaa	try to avoid lip balm containing paraffin or petroleum becos they block the small pores around your lips instead use natural waxes and fats likes bees wax cocoa butter shea butter olive oil or aloe vera waxes protect the lips and oils soften the lips if your lips are really bad use tea tree balm it is a natural anti septic

rFLHaPc3aa	nah, goes on whatever foot you want...<br>  that seriously would take forever!! takes me long enough to do my wash already... no need for extra work! haha.<br>  but sometimes with socks you wear a lot you can kind of tell which foot it usually goes on... like it holds the shape or something.<br>  but i dont usually look.<br>  have fun?|`|mSbvNc16aa	uhm no. not that i know of. but when my socks get out of the wash, they still kind of have the shape of my foot, and i can put it on the same foot. if that makes any sense. haha.|`|B5Qzt5IPaa	No|`|hLdIO43Xaa	Nope, they don't!<br>  It'd be soooo confusing if they did, don't you think? :P|`|MvwO94xAaa	for regular socks no..<br>  <br>  but for those toe socks from back in the 90s, u know the socks like gloves with little openings for ur toes, do
RNfygDqsaa	light brown. caramel colored would look beautiful.    haha ihm like albino so i would kill for your skin tone  =]    hope i helped!    mads|`|dpst3yD9aa	Try blond that's the color of my hair and i think it looks great w/ brown BUT the "new" hair color is chocolate brown and just brown in general! so go w/ brown or w/ lots of skinny golden blond streaks!|`|A77PG2IVaa	how bout blondeee ?|`|7fQLO6gZaa	I must look a heck of a lot like you because you basically just described me...anyway, I always thought my hair would look cool with black, or a lighter brown, or you could go completely different and do a dark purple, red or blue. Good luck!|`|uD7zgtcfaa	I'm not sure what you're attitude is and personality, but if your rocker type i would go for pink or red, and I had A few blond (make sure its lighter than usual) highlights and they looked awesome and my hair is like yours also. if you put your hair up in a ponytail, my friend has this, but she has dark brown hair and she has a thick-ish pink highlight under her hair at the center and when she puts it up it looks pretty sweet!!!    Good luck! Hope you look GREAT!
388cf0eaa7a2668947f521c57a657534aa	i've always put cheek stain on before my foundation. you dot it on and rub it in, blending it just like you would a powder blush, just on the apples of your cheeks and then dabble it in the direction of your hairline just above your ear.     if you have liquid or powder foundation, once that's on, the rosy glow will look more natural and not as messy as a powder blush may be.    best of luck.
XHwhhSgaaa	Personally, I think the best scents are:  Anything citrus (orange, lemon, lime, mango, etc...)  Anything sweet (coconut, cinnamon, sugar, vanilla...)  those are my favorites and they are addicting scents!|`|hLohtlPEaa	I love Paris Hiltons perfume|`|32bf6cc091942a6c4cc7b3f575927ebcaa	Pheromones produced when she is hot and ready to party.|`|392052a3dbd6d94cc65100310f44fccfaa	Vanilla body lotion.:D Yum!|`|td3g3qFeaa	I really like Princess by Vera Wang and Love Harajuku Girls by Gwen Stefani|`|VKmCXK6Baa	i have the very sexy perfume!  my favorite though is ralph lauren rocks.  its the one in the orange bottle.  it smells sooo good.
Ty5dBpFDaa	sit down on a couch. Take a couple of deep breaths slowly, and that should keep you calm. Then look at what homework you have and get an idea of how long it should take. don't rush just go through it calmly.

It sounds like your coming down off of heroine. Are you doing heroine?  Thats bad for you. If you're not doing heroine, maybe its something else. Maybe you should go to the emergency room.|`|vjIUUajsaa	Wow that is tough:( Just stay calm. Really when I feel like that I just let it all go until the next day.|`|nF3AbLBWaa	screw everything and go to sleep.

jCzMMgobaa	the first one|`|ELy7NK0Eaa	I like 1 and 3 alot, 2.. not so much.    But 1 are the cutest.  :]|`|PNA7f0q3aa	The first one, like TOTALLY! haha (; xx|`|VK3kyzGDaa	I dont like 1 or 2....    3 are adorable! Get them! :)|`|YGpciehTaa	1st or 3rd :)|`|e3a09247eee956f065f69d275a013ce2aa	The third ones are really cute!    i'd wear them.  pair it with a cute blouse, and skinny jeans and your set.|`|6RgghI66aa	The first and third ones....they look soo cute. But in the end the choices are up to you!!!|`|997b30eb591fbc4794a68474522f179aaa	Theyre all really cute, so I think it depends on what kind of a look you are going for.  The third pair could be worn with a lot more, and be dressed up or down, while the first two can't be mixed with many different patterns.  I would go with the third one just because it can be worn with more, and you'll probably get more of a use out of them...plus, I looove bows :)|`|5vYtKTkgaa	Dexter Abigail Bow Flat|`|igrdohopaa	I love the first one! (=|`|aV0QmAOtaa	I like 1 and 3.  1 has more of a summer vibe while 3 is more  of a date/dress up kinda shoes. you decide :)|`|QuQioUd7aa	3rd is adorable:)|`|ikXqf20saa	I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE the shoe on the third link! It's SO cute and would go really great with skirts OR jeans    The second shoe would be good for a bohemian look, but i wouldn't like it unless the outfit was fantastic..    The first shoes are pretty bad..|`|jPJaSIXPaa	3rd|`|uRHVCvNPaa	Hi, Nick g/f here I like the 1st pair and the 3rd pair.

Great choice, go for it!!!|`|26lZZaWNaa	Dexter Abagail Bow Flat|`|0PEVAuIkaa	First or last, probably first.    They're both pretty cute(:|`|ALidyPnXaa	I really like the 1st ones.  Super cute. =)|`|zc322tAbaa	The first ones for sure!|`|SxoDVgQ3aa	1 is the cutest   3 is cute too    i dont like 2|`|6JD1KKYcaa	the polka-dotted with bow shoes!  the design would flatter any type of feet.  and it's eccentric than the plaid shoes.    the second one is kinda rounded which is not good to wear if you have cute feet. what size are you by the way?|`|nKBTnQQmaa	1 1 1 1 1 1
q4dXAIvQaa	Hmm..that site looks really cool. ^-^  I'd give it till the beginning of February..if it's a big site then you'll most likely update if it changes. ;]    If you're looking for a really nice dress up site to play while that's opening, you should defiantly check out www.divachix.com. It's a really nice site with a great community (forums). I'm xkpandco on there. ;]
37sxYQPMaa	tomboys dont wear makeup haha. foundation makes ur skin more oily so dont put it on if u have oily skin. shiny is good. well if u reallyyyyyyy want to put makeup on then just go with the eyeliner. put a little not a lot.|`|DRFXicyyaa	wear no make up best tom boyish look|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	Transparent powder can cut down the shine without looking made-up. Try skipping the eyeliner, too. It says, "Look at me, I spent time putting on makeup this morning," which is sort of the definition of girly.|`|YSAU1e9Paa	If you are only wearing foundation and eyeliner that's about as butch as your going to get wearing makeup.
R6Z8onywaa	yeah bloomies has lotsssssss of dresses... you just need to know what you're looking for, imagine your perfect dress, and go from there... who knows...|`|77ab0bba157746561273207e1a20c73baa	well maybe if your butt is not to large|`|AA11966821	Bloomies is good.  But I do like Nordstroms a whole lot better.  If it's a formal occasion, I'd go with Nordstroms or Neiman Marcus.

So you're actually slightly taller than average. Do you hang out with really tall people? That always makes me feel short.|`|Vk6C4ICLaa	i think that sounds right. . .     i am 5'6 but i am still growing.    i would say anywhere from 5'5 - 5'8 is average|`|vJkLFDxnaa	if anything for a girl its a little taller than average   average height is more like idk 5'4-5'5|`|QPQdWsTOaa	thats pretty tall, considering my cousin is 21 and like, 5'2/5'3.|`|uYChUxeiaa	im almost 5'9 and people call me oh so tallll,, its just that theyre all below average and really short hahah   so yeah i think 5'7 is average but closer to being pretty tall for a girl,  anyway models always gotta be 5'7 or taller so yeah :)
lU8e0VQFaa	Just make sure you put on a very high SPF when your outside, and make sure you apply it correctly, you need to put a lot on at least 30 minutes before you go into the sun and reapply often.

Eric Daman is beyond genius.     Bendel's also has some really great things.     Scoop is amazing, it's like an anti-department store, commonly referred to as "the ultimate closet". It truly is, it has alot of things, but it's select things. Essentials everybody should have.     Bloomingdale's also has alot of things you can wear, but it's hard to sort out all their stuff.   Urban Outfitters has alot of Serena/Jenny style things, for much cheaper than the other stores I mentioned.     Forever 21 has some really cute things for really cheap, as well as H&M.     Bergdorf's has an amazing selection of pretty much anything, but I don't really like it. The window displays are amazing though.
X1gOkyNqaa	guy is a creeper, better straight|`|AA10378447	Actually, the curly looks very cute.|`|EALy7X7Gaa	i like it both ways, curly for going out and straight for average days :]|`|g8HAkLYJaa	Curly! Its so pretty!|`|W5za6eB8aa	i personally like it straight!|`|OXLJPgUlaa	i think ur one of those people who look great both  ways.  maybe straighten in some occasions.   but you look really good in both|`|g2h6cgcvaa	i like the straight!|`|PNA7f0q3aa	Curlyness. (: wooo. it's more fun  :D straights kool too, but  get's boring. (:|`|oDbcaGj4aa	you're lucky, you can rock curly and straight.  but Ive always wished i had curly hair.  so i guess i would choose curly :)|`|uD7zgtcfaa	I like it straight. You look really great with it straightened out, and i LOVE your color!!!|`|50Ia20yXaa	actually i personally can not decide. they are different. i do agree that the curls are more fun and cute but the straight hair is cute too. just switch off cause they both are cute|`|AA11513068	curly, it totally screams awesomeness|`|uR5aNpHGaa	it looks alright either way but i like it better straight|`|C5ZAPSfFaa	I like both, but in my opinion the curly looks to fake. I've had friends who have gotten perms, but yours looks more like you used a curling iron. It's still really pretty, just somewhat obvious it's not natural. I like it straight, too, but try using some volumizing products to give it some more body!|`|Dt3EkhEPaa	your hair is cute straight!!! and i think you should die it a tiny bit darker like a rich brown color! itd look good with your skin tone!|`|GhuprdDZaa	i think the straight is wayyyy better but both r good but i definitely like the straight better

I've never seen a cute formal dress for that inexpensive of a price.... Maybe consider upping it to $200? Ask your parents to give you at least that much.  And try Bluefly, since you have a really low budget. They have some cute things for under $300. You should also try looking at boutiques in your area. If you stick to boutiques with more local designers, you may find some cute dresses under $300.  Please avoid Forever 21, Wet Seal, Nordstrom BP, Macy's Junior Department (and women's department, really), Delia's, etc., etc. None of those dresses are cute.

LUdnOK17aa	In my opinion,it sounds creative if it's just a girls night.If alot of people are coming over,buy soda and blast up the music :D|`|mSbvNc16aa	i dont't think that sounds stupid. i think everyone could have a good time.
ALh5R37jaa	i say go with the tights, it will show you are outgoing and have a little wild side and your own personal unique style and that's always a good thing.      good luck on the interview  hope i could help :)|`|BA3y6MBlaa	nope, you already knew that kind of didn't you?  conventional in an interview is always the best.  Upscacle, slacks, a shirt, a jacket, tamed jewlrey, a ready resume in case you have a loser interviewer (I know it's desparate times, but big clue if that's going to be your boss).  Bring paper and pen, ask if you may sit down, ask if he/she doesn't mind your taking notes.    Best of luck.|`|YHQgtP3paa	If you feel comfortable, then you will look great! (:|`|uRA81RXkaa	i dont think so  as long as you look good|`|LlbC91LBaa	go for it! (:     the fashion industry is all about creativity anyways.   why try to conform to what you think they want?|`|0gn1yqiqaa	hey it show sur creative and ur having fun also i dont ithnk it would be as long as u like porfessianal|`|WozaHiDpaa	no! tights are not stylish  believe me|`|EDrsaKsdaa	hmm. sounds interesting. you might be able to pull it off if they don't want suits and what not. good creative thinking though :)|`|cWqVZ33laa	I would!!! That sounds like a really cute outfit!! Good luck!|`|2H2CuvQyaa	this might sound crazy but try to figure out the attire of the employees there by hanging out by the entrance of the potential employer.  that will give you a sense of what they are looking for.|`|7877ff7defc293dc7108230d9f130469aa	Unless it was for an audition for the lead role of the life story of Prince...probably not.  No.|`|2tx3eXtAaa	yea that would be perfect for the job your interviewing for|`|AA11880026	no  they would be great|`|4WjQf1PXaa	Go for it!  Mix it up. If you're going to an interview for the fashion industry, show them that you can work with fashion. If you show up in a normal suit with black tights then you're going to be a zero on their fashion scale even if you're the most creative person they've ever met.   Don't go too overboard, though. Dont show up in motorcycle boots with ripped jeans or a tutu with a clown hat. (jk, jk.) show them that you can be unique and still professional at the same time.  Good luck!|`|l1RgWnUpaa	****** idiot|`|ZPkKk5Rmaa	ya sure , it depends and its mostly your choice ,   It would look nice|`|SJsdZBF9aa	As long as the colours are matching or complement each other. Now, if you were wearing a yellow orange-polkadot dress, added in your purple tights and some green boots, I don't think your interview would go very well.  Although purple tights are pretty radical for an interview. Try getting a friend or friendly neighbour to give you their opinion. If you are still unsure, the safest thing would be to not wear them.    Don't get me wrong: purple tights can go quite nicely with some dresses if matched properly. Radical can be a good thing.|`|e692d44a54eee77a90dc6ec5b3e1214caa	if yOu dress them up really purdyy..&& prOfessiOnal lyke..thenn yeaaap go fOr itt !! :]|`|YsAEPYwOaa	That outfit sounds really stylish...just make sure the boots you choose to wear are classy and look good on your figure so they elongate your legs with the type of dress you are wearing.  I'm sure you will knock them dead.|`|5ZK9VGPCaa	I am a BIG fan of dark purple tights! They are just a bit cooler than black or if you are wearing a lot of black, they can break up an outfit and make it look more interesting. Generally I would have said no don't wear them to an interview, but if it's in the fashion industry then that is different.. In fact I am sure they will appreciate you looking fashionable and stylish rather than conservative. So, go for it!|`|WItdtl0Vaa	Yes I would! I think it's genius. It might be "pushing it" but that's the fun. You can pull it off.
OWjbg4GYaa	I believe in "dress to impress" therefore you should always look your best.|`|HEdZ6RSdaa	with in reason. <br>  girls should not look really hoochy, and boys should ahve their pants acatually coveing their butts|`|zmXHte4Baa	yes, but they have to value themselves so it doesnt go overboard|`|AA11481224	with in reason<br>  <br>  certain parts need to be covered up
c913805b0b5d5329b7df022603b38150aa	Hmm.. Try teasing up your hair, using some eyeliner and foundation, and wear some nice long and frilly velvet shirts. Black lipstick doesn't really suit many people, unless they have very pale natural skin.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	smokey colored eyes, black hair...pale skin...same stuff    black lipstick is not a requirement. I've worn none, silver, green and blue. Also blood red.|`|st5reHVjaa	purple or red  eyeliner.  choker with rose.. and DRESS (kinda short?)|`|AdYiLoO4aa	red lipstick?    black lipstick, is tackyyy.|`|SQWvMx6Maa	Red lipstick and a rose pin in your hair.|`|be01e03cb1940d857445157f422d4379aa	You can go for a very deep red (almost black) or a very deep purple. Try using a deep red liner or black liner for your lips and fading it to a lighter color also.     http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f212/G...|`|Y5ruAxuFaa	*Do regular prep with your foundation and setting make up and all.    *do a really smokey eyeshadow with black and gray.and Cat eyes for you liner. i suggest an angled liner brush with creme eyeshadow (because it gives you more control over were the liner goes)    *then do a LIGHT blush to make it look romantic like    * then at last for your lips do a deep purple liner and lip stick.    in the end it looks really great i did this for my anniversary and my boyfriend loved it|`|9Xub66GJaa	To pull off the subtly goth look without resorting to black lipstick, find a nice shade of dark purple. Think "black cherry". It is a great shade for autumn and winter, and is perfectly appropriate for work! It gives the wearer an air of darkness and mystery that completes a gothic wardrobe or a skirt suit wonderfully!|`|LZ6D41pQaa	red lipstick, not a lot of eyeshadow, but make it a soft gray color and long lash extending mascarra... Um probably wear like a red shirt with a black skirt. hope i helped

dUHq4B4qaa	Hydrogen peroxide.  Believe it or not, it whitens faster than anything you could buy. In fact, on of the ingredients in whitening products is hydrogen peroxide.    My ex dicovered this on accident a few months ago. He got 2 monroes and 2 lip piercings all in the same day...he needed a way to clean them all on the inside quickly. So instead of using a Q-tip and single handedly cleaning each one, he got a little bit of peroxide and swished it once a day like mouthwash. Oh. My. God. His teeth were SOOOOOOOO white within...oh, maybe 3 or 4 days.    It tastes gross, but hey, its cheap and I bet you even have some lurking in your medicine cabinet as I'm typing. If you don't want to swish it...I'm positive taking a Q-tip and rubbing some on your teeth would do the trick. I use hydrogen peroxide too, I freaking love it. Those gels and strips don't do poop.    Note of warning, don't swallow it. O_O  But we all know you're smarter than that. ;)|`|mPMFd6CFaa	that Listerine mouth wash actually works wonders. it was really surprising. you just have to stick to it though. good luck :)|`|SiGVPuFmaa	crest white strips for a week and brush with baking soda once a week after that.
997b30eb591fbc4794a68474522f179aaa	Well, if there's going to be a party and it's more of a laid back bar mitzvah then a party dress is fine, some bar mitzvahs are much more formal and you would need a homecoming formal dance type dress, and others are much more traditional and it would be inappropriate to wear anything too revealing or short, so you should ask your friend what type of event it is going to be before deciding.  Ask other friends that are going what they are wearing, too.  Have fun!|`|63s3G8YUaa	You need to dress somewhat dressy. I'm Jewish, so when I go to these type of things, I usually wear a dress or skirt. You have to dress somewhat modestly. Also, there is a rule that you have to have your shoulders covered. I know it is a pain, but old Jewish ladies will look at you funny (it has happened to me before, it was awkward). You can wear a jacket or cardigan though, so if you don't have any sleeved dresses, you can do that. You don't want to draw too much attention to yourself at Bar Mitzvahs. Your dress doesn't have to cover the knee, but it can't be a super short dress. If your dress is a bit short, wear tights. Don't wear a super dressy dress. When I go to Bar/Bat Mitzvahs, I usually wear a purple tank dress and tights with a black cardigan over it and heels or flats. If you are going to the party, that is a different story. Wear a dress that you feel confident in. If the party is more formal, it may say so on the invitation. But if you really aren't sure, then wear your favorite not too dressy dress.|`|XZS5XeK9aa	if its going to be warm a summer dress.  i would say nothing to bright, nothing real black.     http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/cat...    http://www.kohls.com/kohlsStore/juniors/...|`|Z1OszV3raa	I'm assuming you're a girl...If you're not, than sorry :)  It depends on the type of Bar Mitzvah.  If it is a day service, wear a nice blouse and skirt, or a daytime dress.  Then, if there is a party at night, wear a little fancier dress, like a party dress.  If it is a night service and then a party, wear a party dress with a sweater or jacket to go over it during the service.  If you have any specific questions, don't be afraid to ask your friend!|`|ANU22Xfnaa	any presentable dress really... as long as your not dressed more then the actual bar mitzvah kid|`|zG4Q21K6aa	Usually there is a morinig ceremony, where they read the torah and everything. To that you wear a very conservative dress. Nothing too flashy or revealing.    Then if there is a party at night you can wear what ever you want. Usually, you wear like party dresses.     Hope I helped! (:

G4wDlSh7aa	deep condition your hair twice a week. use cold water when shampooing. don't brush your hair when it's wet, use a wide-toothed comb. i've heard beer && honey is good for your hair idk.    && i know this is going to sound gross but..  get a cup of mayo && heat it in the microwave for 20 seconds. then mix a little olive oil in with it && cake it into your hair. place a shower cap over it for 30 or so minutes && then wash it out.  it's ahhmazing for your hair.  good luck! :))|`|hQNHzc6faa	Get hair trimmed regularly, it's a must to get rid of splitends.   Try Aussie's 3 minute miracle conditioner.  When you straighten hair, use a heat protectant, it does help. I would recommand Alberto's Miracle Mist or Tresemme's thermal creations heat tamer spray, they're both great products.|`|EQaGQ6hWaa	you could always take supplement for your hair and eat a lot of fruites and vegetables plus use a hair mask once a week|`|SQWvMx6Maa	You could use shampoos such as dove or anything to help with split ends. at least trim your hair every 3 months or few weeks.|`|0QE1nM0Haa	Eat healthy foods and DON'T wash your hair with hot water wash it with cold water. Trim your ends regularly and when you do straightenen,curl or blow dry your hair use a heat protection spray.|`|8wWPmytSaa	i do a weekly deep conditioner that stays in for about 10 minutes.  this makes your hair real nice and smooth but it also repairs your hair from the damage the heat products you used that week.    also just make sure you get a regular trim.    i hope i helped.|`|t8VEswrmaa	get a straightener that uses steam instead of heat its better for your hair and makes it shinier also after and before straightening or curling put some leave in conditioner it helps|`|NBK3s2LVaa	Take vitamins,drink lots of water and deep condition your hair once a week with something like ion protein pack oh also never brush your hair with a hair brush when its wet use a wide tooth comb instead :)|`|zPRU92ygaa	try pantene pro v styling set  it made my hair healthy  and dont put chemicals in your hair|`|Dt3EkhEPaa	Okay! I'm guessing that you shower daily! So, one thing that you can do it to not wash it everytime.. that drys your hair out! also you can take vitamin E it is very good for hair and nails...and skin! You might try getting it trimmed now and then to because this causes rapid growth and takes off all the damage! your right DO NOT straighten or curl if you want it healthy :P i get little "shine drops" too. just add them to your hair when it is damp and it looks much more healthy    Good Luck!!!|`|LVy1YMswaa	Go to www.HealthyHairJourney.com  There are a bunch of healthy hair techniques there..too many for me to cut and paste here|`|xm4E3Epaaa	Well there are loads of things;  try not to wash your hair too often, (don't wash it every day, wash it maybe every other day) and condition it with an organic conditioner that doesn't strip it of its natural proteins, try Original source, they smell and work amazingly !  or if not, use neutral ph shampoos & conditioners:)  Try not to use too many products on your hair either, keep it to the bare minimal as a build up of product can be harmful to your scalp+ hair (depends on the product though)  Try let your hair dry naturally as much as you can and try to blow dry instead of straightening/curling as the amount of damage is less,  when your hair feels like it lacks nourishment rub a fair amount of jasmine/coconut/almond oil into your hair and leave it in for a couple of hours- then wash thoroughly and condition, your hair feels baby soft after that :)    -obviously you don't have to do all of these things, but as much as you can/want will make your hair alot less damaged (if it is damaged)  and alot more silky+shiny   hope it helped :)    xxx|`|4WXdPs6kaa	Keep it well moisturized by using spray in conditioner after you shower. and I know you said that you know straightening and curling does damage but if you spray in a heat protector (which you can find at wal-mart) before you use those things it doesn't hardly cause any damage. Also use a hot oil treatment once in a while it repairs some damage and also makes your hair really soft. Hope this helps :D|`|NtrUG5EEaa	When showering don't use very hot water, and take a quick cold rinse after.  When straightening hair,It's imperative that straighteners should only ever be used on completely dry hair because electricity and water don't mix. Before you start, give your hair a good brush to distribute the natural oils present and to encourage the cuticle to lie flat; this should help minimise damage.   Never brush your hair when it's wet.   Drink a lot of water to keep hair shiny, soft and pliable  Have your hair trimmed regularly, at least half an inch every four to six weeks.  Use a hair mask weekly.
9eUvCDovaa	1.) stay away from heat appliances, if you gotta blow dry hair let it airdry    2.) put alot of leave in conditioners, garnier fructis has good ones    3.) use at least a deep conditioner on your hair 2 times a week    4.) Get your damaged hair cut off, the less damage, the more it grows      i did this and whoa! my hair has really really grown    goodluck :)|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Rub olive oil into the scalp and massage to promote hair growth , leave for 1 hour and wash.

knvSmMB0aa	Hi there :)    I LOVELOVELOVE my neutrals :)  I'm blonde and have a medium to light tone, and they look GREAT!    First, use a dark brown eyeliner on bottom and top lids, and from the outer corners of your eyes, drag the pencil out just a bit into an upward curve (like Cleopatra, but not as drastic).  Then, on your upper lash-line, use a chocolate-colored eyeshadow.  Above that, use a medium brown, and then above that, on your brow bone, use a tan with a hint of gold.  Blend it together so it looks soft.  Curl your eyelashes and use a VERY dark brown mascara.  There you go- beautiful! :)    Let me know how it looks    Autumn|`|VpxQ7Du9aa	u look gorgeous w/ out make up  dont waste ur money!!!  u dont need make up!!!!!!!!!!  trust me!!!!!!|`|0QE1nM0Haa	Both pictures almost look the same, you don't look bad without makeup at all I think you look better.

1JywgkyMaa	well,there is this one girl from my driver's ed class,she sat a couple of rows down from me,i asked her out one day and she said she's not allowed to date,i don't know if thats true or not,but that doesn't make me like her any less
LCcW7KSsaa	It looks like they are all at an age where they are not really their prettiest anyway. The chubby one on the far left will probably grow into her body and loose a lot of weight. She will probably be totally hot if she goes in the rigth direction. The two in the middle look like they will look pretty much the same forever. The black girl on the end will probably grow up and get contact and a flat iron. I looked like her when I was younger and I was really goofy looking with a goofy personality to match, but I grew up and (I hate to sound conceited) but I am a total BABE! In this picture, I would say the second girl from the right is the prettiest BUT I don't like her nose.    And that is probably you because a girl will put up bad pictures of her friends in comparison to how she looks. I do it. All girls do it.|`|kS7JqjPzaa	Girl all the way to the right.|`|WD3a7jJYaa	SECOND TO LEFT|`|0PEVAuIkaa	You are all pretty, but probably in this order:    2nd to left, 3rd to left, 1st to left, 4th to left.  ^  prettiest|`|adCVnOVwaa	the second girl from the left my coz wants ot ask the first girl from the left out though.lol|`|FQ5W5Xmoaa	the second girl to  the left|`|TwphAhUZaa	all of u are pretty! but the second girl from left is prettier|`|Zf2grNxQaa	The girls in this picture are way to young for me to answer without fearing Chris Hensen knocking on my door.|`|bCddjqcmaa	the second one....|`|MXpW48lFaa	The blonde girl on the RIGHT.

You look like a gawky teenager going through an awkward stage in her life.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	The only reason people had gotten mad at what you said was because you were full of yourself.

Ok, you can think your pretty but what does you bragging about you having a large bust line, 6 pack, playing all kinds of sports have to do with what your face looks like? That is why people got pissed off. If you would of just said "Do you think I am pretty?" You also could of told us that you are confident in yourself but you want others opinions. Some of us would of bashed you because you were putting a pic of your self on the web and some of us would of gave you an opinion.

It doesn't look good at all, personally I think you should be a brunette, and make it a chocolate brown, that'd look pretty on you.  AND GET THEM BRACES OFF! you won't look any better until they're off!  and and and what else... wear better make up? don't wear lip gloss it looks dumb.    Basically, just do what I said with the hair and you'll be so much hotter.|`|gsjtcYRaaa	No...  you look like Dakota Fanning (not a compliment)  except with braces and crazy hair|`|dnjmYR6Faa	You have to much Teeth!    dont smile so much, and i geuss when you get your braces of you will be alot prettyer. They dont do you much justice dharling.      JONAH|`|rfOFuGNNaa	Okay,     Do something about those bags under your eyes, next remove the mole on you chin. Then straighten your hair and add some layers and highlights. Tan a little too.    After your braces come off you will feel better about your smile, and you have nice sized **** so...    And if you think that your not pretty it shows also.

But you can not speak the same.    Belly Button doesn't hurt. Always cute for bathing suits.    I personally like a diamond stud nose ring. Kinda painful but very cute! And with any piercing, watch out for snagging on towels! You tend to forget they are there!|`|nF3AbLBWaa	tongue rings are gross, and scary.  What if it came out, and you swallowed it and died?  haha, but belly button rings are kind of cool.|`|kS7JqjPzaa	Honestly piercing is attractive to a girl. But I don't prefer a girl with multiple piercing, it's just my opinion.|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	go with the belly button. that way you can hide it when you have to|`|vM2o0Nicaa	Yeah piercings are attractive, and besides guys wouldn't care, it makes something feel better when you have a tongue ring.|`|0vg85K6Xaa	Well I don't have one but my friend has a tongue ring and she said it doesn't hurt until a day or two after.You can't say Theodore Rosevelt   ( my friend tried and it came out funny lol) You can't eat solid foods for about a week or so maybe less it depends on how fast you heal. And a belly ring I herd different things I herd they hurt and I herd they don't. The only problem you might have is getting it to heal right so make sure to do EVERYTHING they tell you. Cleaning wise. And with all piercings It depends on your pain tolerance. And it is completely up 2 u.

The tongue barely hurts, the naval is a little worse than getting your ears pierced, piercings in places with high concentrations of nerves like the nipple, hurt the worst of all.  Before you get your tongue pierced though, think, am I going to want this when i'm 90? and also is this going to affect my employability in my chosen field?

bRoFUcIgaa	White skinny jeans should be in style for awhile as they are considered a staple item to many, along with black skinny jeans. White is also a good colour for spring being crisp, fresh, and what not.  Trends for 09:  ~Animal print (leopard, zebra, etc.)  ~Fringe  ~Gladiators (they were in style last spring/summer & are still hot for this spring/summer)  ~High waist pencil skirts/denim/shorts  ~Drop waist tops/dresses  ~Wrap cardigan/oversized cardigan  ~Plaid shirts/plaid in general  ~Oversized jewelry (large rings, layered necklaces, etc.)|`|LXCfeUbjaa	depends on what you wear them with i guess  i have the same exact jeans (:  i like them, and your opinion is all that matters, right?|`|2tx3eXtAaa	out but if you had like a cute black top then in lol|`|BboRJcX5aa	most defiently in!|`|uZcubIrzaa	innn !|`|bRB8srUuaa	in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in in|`|T2HaAJasaa	ehh alot of ppl think there cool but,,your just known as dumb a fake poser :]]    but girl dont care what ppl think about you,,    if youlike them , thats all that matters    really if someone makes fun of you for wearing what you want and doing as you please,,,they arnt a good friend or aperson youshould be friends with :]]    be yourself thats more than enough    haha personaly my friend has themm,,ehh i dont really care  and i was gonna buy them,,but i thought about the same question your wondering and yehh :]]|`|pQiGyFhlaa	it depends what shrit ur going to were|`|l5NGSmYDaa	I don't see the point of them they look kind of emo and stuff but I guess it's really your choice.|`|fiJwqH8Paa	I bought the same ones...I got them for Christmas from my mom and idk wheather or not to wear them eighter....i didnt wear the yet ahaha  but i think i am soon  with a bron shirt you know?|`|eVPW1dwOaa	Kind of out...|`|AXcGAbrDaa	in  when you wear them wear them with a pretty shirt and some flats or leg warmers..that's in wear i live|`|997b30eb591fbc4794a68474522f179aaa	Why does it matter whether they are in or out?

7f217ccda43c76f8c4728b2cdf19d4dfaa	I have super oily skin too. I started using the Clinique 3 step thing. It really helps the oil and makes my skin so much clearer. And I also use their Superfit make up and it makes such a huge difference! I swear by it. You might also want to switch to an oil free moisturizer. Clinique makes some really nice ones. I think it's called super defense.    I also use MAC's blot powder. It has kind of a powdery finish but work well for oily skin. And I use the clean and clear blotting sheets. Those work well. They take a little bit of your make up off but not a lot.    I've used the bare minerals stuff, totally doesn't work for me. It made me break out!    As for the rest of your make up, I would say just slowly use less eyeliner. Or try doing a thinner line of eyeliner and then mascara. Eventually, you'll get used to not a lot of make up. Also, you could change the color. Switch to brown instead of black, etc. You don't have to stop completely. I think it's really great for women to have a lot of different looks. It makes life interesting.    I hope that helps. Good Luck!|`|kW371HVMaa	Get Cliniques Face Wash 3 Step System|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	Okay, best advice I can give you is try go naked for a couple of days. even if its days when your just at home. I find that boiling water in a pot, putting in a nice smelling somthing like cinnimon and such and letting the steam go on your face heals it well. It makes you sweat so its like a sauna for your face. Use a LIGHT moisturiser, preferrably for oily skin.  As for make up, Dont pack it on, thats the worse and most expensive tyhing and people don't like a cake face.  Just use a powder, light powder. You don't need eye liner packed on, just a thin line  will do, then itll last longer.|`|t0PzSCs0aa	make sure anything you put on your face is oil-free, noncomedogenic, etc.     i use Medi-Matte to keep my oil under control, it works really well and also chips in to help clear skin up.  http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...      my doctor laughed at me one time when i asked him for an acne presciption, said that i was spinning in circles- the more breakouts, the more makeup, even more breakouts.  he recommended breaking the cycle by taking a break from makeup. maybe when your not planning on going out in public?    definietly wash your makeup off at night, dont be lazy, it will only make your skin worse.|`|Ac9AzRHRaa	for starters,if you have oily skin, make sure you wash your face at least twice a day (i do morning and night)     then use an oil free moisturizer     for powder, make sure your using a loose powder, cause pressed powder give a more natural look, there's nothing wrong with applying it too often        and i also had that same eyeliner problem,   slowly ease off on the amount you put on the bottom of your eye,  and start using a liquid eyeliner on the top    eventually, you wont have to wear it on the bottom at all :)  plus, liquid eyeliner is dark, lasts longer, and is super pretty      i hope that helps|`|vCXzfhTpaa	Get oil blotting tissues at the drug store, you can use them over your make up.      As for the eyeliner, put on a thin layer on top and bottom then use black or gray shadow and trace over it and blend.  This should give you a more defined look w/o having deep, dark heavy lines.  Here is a great tutorial for this and it looks classy yet bold and hot.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWIk5c7jR...|`|1b7N75Kraa	Just because the label reads "Organic" or "All-Natural" does not necessarily mean its great for your skin. So this powder could be clogging up your pores. Especially since you constantly reapply it and never let your pores "breathe". First, find a good makeup remover. If you don't remove your makeup completely by the end of the day, they WILL clog your pores even if they claim not to clog your pores. Second, get oil blotters. These little towelettes mop up ALL your oil and leave your make up intact so that you don't have to constantly reapply make up. Third, get a daily facial routine. Based on your description, I assume that you have oily acne prone skin, right? Well try this http://www.skinid.com/econsumer/clearski... to find out EXACTLY what to do with your skin. As a starter though, I recommend getting Neutrogena Acne Wash, Witch Hazel, and a light moisturizer and sunscreen with an SPF of 15. Wash your face daily abnd nightly, use the witch hazel as a toner, and remember to apply sunscreen and moisturizer. Fourth, remember: don't pick at your pimples and don't touch your face with your hands constantly. Fifth, good luck and hope I helped!|`|HOT2PRKdaa	Okay, first of all, your face is probably not jacked up like you say. I'm almost 17, so I understand where you're coming from, though. The expensive organic mineral powder is probably not doing its job of not making your face oily. I use Clinique, which you can find at Macy's or www.clinique.com. There is a 3-step process that helps you get rid of pimples, prevent pimples, and stop your face from getting dry or oily depending on what the problem is. In your case, its oiliness. You should try some of the things they Kmart, Kroger, Walmart, or Meijer sells that's Neutrogena or something for your pimples. To get of your pimples as well, you can't always be caking your face with powder. That's what makes it break out. You can put a little bit on, but not to cover your whole face in it. How about using foundation or putting powder only where it needs to be? I understand you mean by feeling naked because a lot of my friends and girls in my 11th grade class say the same. Although, here the style is still in with the dark eyeliner. Many of my friends stopped that, though, and you know what? They looked amazing! You could finally see their eyes! I think ALL of them looked fabulous! I think you will, too. You just can't focus on your habits of putting so much powder and eyeliner on. Don't focus, as well, on what other people think. I know it's a common thing to say, but it's SO true. If you believe you look good and you're confident, others will like it. So this is my plan for you...    1. Buy the 3-step process from Clinique. You'll probably spend around $35.00, but it's SO worth it and you'll have it for about one year. By the way, get it when they're giving offers. You'll know what I'm talking about if you ask them. : )    2. Buy a Neutrogena product or something similar for your pimples.    3. Throw about the powder and the eyeliner!    You'll look BEAUTIFUL, girl! : ) Be confident, smile, and everything will be alright! : ) I hope what I said works for you! Make sure you really try it, though. It's worth every penny! Sorry I wrote so much! : )|`|be01e03cb1940d857445157f422d4379aa	First of all you need to get your skincare routine in order. For oily skin my favorite by far is Philosophy at Sephora ( http://www.sephora.com/browse/brand_hier... ). They have one of the best skincare lines I've ever used and tons of oil free products that will control oil. Another (less expensive) alternative is the Tea Tree Oil line at The Body Shop, which works miracles for oily skin.     Yes, the mineral makeup you are putting on could be causing your face to be like, "WTF!" Mineral makeup is not always good for your face. There are no regulations on what constitutes "mineral makeup" therefore, if it is powder and makeup they can call it mineral makeup. Bare Essentials is crap, it's a marketing ploy.     So now that you'll get some good skincare let's talk makeup. Wear a powder foundation like MAC Studio Fix which will soak up any oil your skin will produce throughout the day. If you want to wear eyeliner but not all around your eye try doing the "cat eye" look: http://images-cdn01.associatedcontent.co...    My favorite and most effective way of applying eyeliner is with a brush. If you get a very small brush like Benefit's Get Bent Brush ( http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh... ). Then with a gel eyeliner or cake eyeliner (activated with water) you glide on your eyeliner on your top lid. If you have to have liner on the bottom try going along your lash line only halfway in, it will make your eyes look bigger. If you apply eyeliner around your entire eye, it makes your eyes appear smaller.     Hope this helps!!

v90vFco1aa	It most likely is a keloid. Keloids form because cartilage does not get very good blood circulation or something. Do you have sea salt for soaks? Keep doing your sea salt soaks that your piercer (should have) told you about. If you don't have any sea salt, I don't know where to advise you to get some because it's always been given to me. But make sure it's sea salt and not regular table salt.    If you don't have any sea salt then just let the water hit your nose while you're in the shower each time for about five minutes. The warm water stimulates blood circulation which helps the piercing heal. The keloid should go away after a few sessions of warm soaks.     Hope I could help.
RjKbZQN1aa	Geurlain makes a kohl eyeliner, and just recently HIP came out with a line if loose kohls. They look wonderful!
dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	The best drops I have found are Refresh Liquigel. Its a gel so it actually stays in the eye. I haven't found anything else to work. They are a little expience but well worth it.
jhUyINTsaa	do pink or blue or purple underneath, either would look great, and do like one streak going through your bangs to just make a pop of color, but the underneath color will pop too and will look great    i have dark brown hair and i did blue underneath with a blue bang streak, it was awesome     hope this helps :)|`|wIRszCihaa	purple bangs.  or just the back half of your head purple...  or your bangs AND the back half ^^|`|ZsPQk9MEaa	Just leave it black, it looks fine :]|`|Ux2dBxtDaa	Yeah, keep it black, and put in some tiny streaks of red, blue, orange and pink all throughout your hair.

They also half to carry insurance which also inspects them.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	They do have laws about sterilization... there are classes they have to take on blood borne illnesses and everything.

You slur and eating anything is kinda painful.    Make sure you rinse your mouth with mouthwash after every meal you have and when you drink anything other than water. You do NOT want it infected.
0EaA6IACaa	just get some dish soap or any kind of cleanser and a tooth brush and scrub as harddd as you can. it won't get them completely clean, but it definitley makes a hugeeee difference, trust me i had a pair of white ones that i had to wear to work everyday and they would get soo dirty.    you can also put them in the washing maching, that works too, but just be sure not to put them in the dryer.    i would reccomend buying the leather ones though, you can't see the firt on them. they're more expensive, but definitely worth it.|`|xPfJG3FGaa	any kind of liquid soap, and an old toothbrush, scrub, scrub, scrub!!!|`|Ly20pGC9aa	fifteen bucks, buy new ones.|`|OGLulBtwaa	For real, just get new ones.

dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	Lighten your hair with lemon juice.    Sun exposure will lighten your hair, although very slowly. The acid in lemon juice can help it happen faster.     Put some lemon juice on your hair where you want it lighter and go out in the sun. It seems to work best on people who have dirty blonde or light brown hair.    Use it on dirty hair, rather than freshly washed hair. That way the oils in your hair will protect it from the drying effects of lemon juice.     Squeeze the juice out of a few lemons, mix it with a third amount of water and put it in one of those cheap plastic spray bottles. Spray it all over your hair before going outside for all over lightening.    I also use Sun In but it will dry your hair out so deep condition about twice a week. I use Aussie 3 minute miracle conditioner|`|Techlvbxaa	Highlights by a professional. I would NOT recommend Sun-In. Did it once and will never do that again. I have done the lemon and natural sunlight. That works for a subtle change. Coloring with a boxed product will not make it lighter. You need to remove color.|`|jlLSHwICaa	sun in or lemon juice|`|f481ueRQaa	the sun. hair dye.|`|Kx1T6Tzgaa	put lemon juice in it and but it in the sun.   also you can buy shampoos and conditionars that are made to bring out your natural highlights.|`|MlvdIEJzaa	Theres this stuff u can get at Walmart called sunin u spary it on ur hair b4 u blowdry|`|hcxBtzzLaa	what you can do is get some lemon juice but try not to get as many seeds as possible, in a bottle,  pour it on your hair and sit back and relax... oh but one more thing... you have to be in the sun... got to the beach or something and just sit there with the lemon juice on your hair.. you will see it getting lighter.        P.S. my names lauren too.. haha :D|`|1YHih8wyaa	chamomile shampoo & conditioner :o) loof for it at the drug store like cvs.|`|eMcxuo3Vaa	Sun-in|`|4aGoWKtEaa	Bleach it :D My friend who is also a dirty blonde did the same thing and it came out perfectly.|`|98LDN0Quaa	highlights
mMvEEZ3oaa	have you tried antibotics from your dermotologist  they are amazing   nothing else worked for me|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Yeah, you're not ready for Accutane yet, the dermatologist will probably put you on Driffrin or Rentin-A or something else, maybe even look into Red/blue light treatments, I've heard some good things about those.     Yes, the side effects are long and can be serious, and death is a possibility, which is why it's easier to buy a handgun than it is to get this Rx. Your lucky though, since your a guy you won't have to go through the half of it, but there will be monthly blood tests and Dr visits and you MUST have insurance, my treatment is about $2500 per month.     Accutane really is something you need to go over with your Dr, there's  a lot involved and serious side effects and complications to be considered.|`|edzU8VJiaa	Dousn't sound as though you are ready for the Accutane yet.  This is a last-resort drug which IS a miracle-worker.  My grandson had galloping acne from the age of 14. He tried everything and was eventually prescribed Accutane because nothing else worked.    He took it for several months, and his acne disappeared.  He is now 20, has a clear skin, and has suffered no side effects, apart from a tendency to bay at the moon occasionally......|`|ZArYUIMcaa	try using like neutrogena thats what i use and it works really good or get proactive  but if u wanna use the accutane stuff then u can, but warning not all of thse"miricle creams" work|`|lg2RfcrQaa	I was actually going to suggest Oxytetracycline but you've already had it. I've been taking it since last year and it's worked great for me. I can understand it won't have the same effects on everyone though.  I'm sure your dermatologist will talk you through the treatment and put you at ease. Often the side effects are just in really rare cases. If everybody had liver failure from it, it'd be banned.|`|vKCgXxBsaa	I'm really sorry you're going through this :(  my brother suffered with really bad acne a couple of years ago and i know how down and depressed it made him.  Like you he tried everything and nothing seemed to work until he tried some supplements from LA Muscle-  I think they're called LA Style. I can't even begin to tell you what a difference they made.  Also as other people have mentioned drinking lots of water every day helps and also tea tree is realy good.|`|mU6Owbhoaa	have your triend changing your diet, that works the best. cut out all sugars and fats and eat plenty of fruit and veg and drink lots of water.|`|cCHG7kHwaa	It's a shame you're a guy because the pill works wonders on clearing acne. I came off it a few months ago and its all coming back so im definetly going back on.|`|c26e39ebae3fd8fb31ce4def18eefae6aa	I'd like to share a little something.  I'm 16 years old and had acne for over 7 years. It seemed crazy to me that I was going to a dermatologist at the age of 9.  For 7 years, my mom and I searched for an acne treatment that was right for me. I tried everything you can imagine, from topical gels, to antibiotics, to even products I saw on t.v., like Murad and Proactive. Then my brother got introduced to Accutane. It worked wonders for him. It took me a very long time to finally decide Accutane was something I would try. The possible side affects scared me, but 9 years later, I was willing to try anything. Preparing for Accutane isn't easy. You must get a blood test every month as well as a pregnancy test. Your doctor will help you choose 2 forms of birth control, in case one fails. However, like I mentioned, anything to cure my acne would be amazing. After 7 years of moderate acne, I had no idea what my skin had actually looked like. I was starting to worry because I was in month 5, with only one month to go, and my acne still had work for improvement. Shockingly, right before I was to stop Accutane, my face seemed to clear right up. I still get a pimple here and there, usually right before my period, but it's very easy to cover up with a little make-up. I'm still told that my acne will not FULLY heal until about a year after I ended Accutane. It's almost been a year and I'm extremely happy with the results. My problem with other acne treatments, was that it would semi-work but then I would go off of them, and my acne would come right back. With Accutane, you don't have to worry about that. However, some people go on Accutane a second time because their acne starts to come back after about a year or so. The success rate is incredible. It's definitely worth it, especially if you've tried everything on the market. So speak with your dermatologist to determine if Accutane is right for you.|`|LUVBrg3Maa	Maybe you're allergic to something. I have been battling acne since i was 14, now i'm 21. A friend told me to stop eating anything with corn in it and amazingly my acne went away. Occasionally I eat something without realizing it has corn in it and I break out. Just to warn you getting tested for allergies didn't prove that I was allergic to corn. I also use St. Ives apricot scrub for blemishes and blackheads and I use clean & clear moisturizer with spf 15 to keep my face from drying out. I had tried accutane before and it does really work, don't get the generic though. I had to stop taking it to get my wisdom teeth removed before I finished treatment. Side effects from accutane aren't really as bad but they still have to warn you.|`|8e885c463613a2a46008f0074c740cbcaa	Yeh seems like my acne just wont go away, and please DO NOT use proactiv...EVER!!....I have oily combo skin, and spending more money tends to help.  I've found so far the best things that work is....    Dr Brandt.  -If this stuff can help me it can help anybody!  Pro: works, and I only used samples  Cons: expensive and you get small amounts    The Philosophy line - Expensive but hope in a jar is great!  Pro: works!  Con: price!!!    Natures Cure Papaya Acne wash -This stuff cleared my skin up in a week...blemishes and all!!!!!!  You gotta order it from the natures cure site.    Pro: only 19.99...probably the best one I listed.  Papaya has an enzyme in it that clears blemishes almost immediately...if u can just find a papaya put that on your face, trust me it works!    Con: gotta order it from the site, though papaya works it's oily, so if u already have oily skin you'll shine like the sun!  Also, my skin looked BEAUTIFUL after the week I used it (no lie), but since they stopped selling it in stores, when I ran out my face just broke back out (remember there is no cure for acne)|`|lar1FyQBaa	I highly recommend evening primrose oil gel tablets for you.  I take 1,000 mg daily and I've never had clearer skin.  Plus you should be drinking plently of water.  Water is great at flushing out toxins in the body.|`|vuUVmS7Saa	Well. I'm 14 and  was prescribed roaccutane four months ago and i have to say its amazing. Ok, you get very dry lips and in some cases severe dry skin but a deep moisturiser will sort the dryness out. Anyway, and as long as you're liver is healthy when you start taking it there will probably be no problem. It's amazingg stuff and cleared my skin completely up, like my derm said it looks like you've never had a spot before in your life. Hope you go for it, i personally think its worth it all the way!

y0bcS3OIaa	No question about it.  Makeup Forever's Aqua Eyes stick to your eyes like glue.  When you apply it you get a bit of t ime to smudge it to your liking.  After that it just sticks.  Sometime when I've had a long night and knocked out without washing my face, the eyeliner is still on my eyes the next day.  But even washing your face you'll have trouble removing this eyeliner.  What I do is that I use eye makeup remover first and wash my face twice.  I know it can be a little annoying, but for the results, this eyeliner is worth it!|`|st5reHVjaa	mary kay.  i do a little liquid on the top eyelid and pencil on the bottom.  almay liquid and mary kay pencil.  try a brown or different colors to spice it up :)  ask ur friends what they use.|`|aNfGqkrpaa	Avon.  they have blue, black brown, emerald, and a few other colors, I think.

LaQ8Ejt3aa	You did not have henna you had  fake dangerous black PPD hair dye.  So you are fine if you want to get  a real henna tattoo or a needle inked  Permanent tattoo.    IF you are sensitized to PPD, you would not be able to wear black clothing or anything with back dye in it|`|lU8e0VQFaa	I think you need to discuss this with both your Dr and your artist. Black 'henna' (isn't actually henna at all) can be very dangerous, but it sounds as though you had a (relatively) mild reaction. Tell your Dr about your experience and that you want a tattoo and see what he says. Also be sure to mention to your artist that you had a reaction so that he can make sure the ink he uses will be less likely to cause another.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	You should be fine. Your reaction wasn't that severe - most people who react have the black henna permanently etched into their skin. http://www.hennapage.com/henna/ppd/index...    Do you wear makeup? Do you react to certian kinds of makeup? Have you tried coloring your hair? You could always do a patch test with a dark colored box dye and see if you react to that. If you don't, I would assume you are safe to get a tattoo.    I have super sensitive skin, and I would react to certain hair dyes, and I have several tattoos. I think, scientifically, that ink that they use to tattoo is very chemically different than hair color pigment.    I'm not a professional and do not wish to be percieved as such, so throw out all the above advise and ask a professional tattoo artist. They would know for sure.

ojD1pAIsaa	1)Wear stylish clothes. Buying clothes that are in style is key. If your parents don't want to buy you clothes, save up money and go on a mini shopping spree for yourself. Go to stores you like and browse for items on sale; they can be just as good! Keep your own style, but try to follow what your peers are wearing also. Don't buy clothes that are too tight fitting, or too revealing. Make sure the clothes fit you. Show off your best assets and hide your flaws.    2)Take care of your face and skin. Taking care of your skin and face can be hard because everyone's skin is different. You can have oily skin, dry skin, sensitive skin, or acne. Which is why it is important to experiment with different face care products, or little things to do by yourself and find one that fits you. If your skin is so dry to the point that its flaking off; in the shower, or with warm water in the sink, take a washcloth and rub the extremely dry areas on you face with a little soap on the washcloth. Dry, and then apply toner and lotion afterwards, to your whole face. If your skin isn't as dry, then just apply the toner, and a good moisturizing lotion. Sun lotions (for after tanning) are the most hydrating.    3)Apply make-up well. Doing makeup is something that can make you look better, or worse. Use a makeup that works for your skin. Picking the right shade of foundation is very, very important. On top of your foundation, use a little bit of eyeliner on the top of your eyelid, along your lashline, and apply a little amount on the bottom. It defines your eye, and makes them pop. Depending on what color your hair/eyes/ skin is you will have to get different shades of blacks, browns, purples and blues. Try using lip balm, and occasionally lip gloss. Too much makeup looks horrible, so don't over do it.    4)Get tanned! Go to the beach, pool or even just your backyard and get a nice tan! Don't forget to wear sunscreen, because no one looks good with a sunburn! If you do get sunburnt, rub on some aloe vera wherever it hurts. If the thought of skin cancer freaks you out but you still want to go for that bronzed look, try a moisturizer with skin darkening compounds such as Jergens natural glow.|`|ALidyPnXaa	EYES: you could try a light shimmery eyeshadow (gold, violet, cream...) & mascara ONLY on your top lashes. This style takes literally five minutes and makes you look cute & presentable. I said mascara only on top because it can make the bottoms look sticky & messy. =) If you want to add some eyeliner, try a light silver or brown. Urban Decay makes great eyeliners that stay on all day ! You could try those.    HAIR: Wear it down naturally! That's always really pretty. If you can french braid your hair, that's really cute & will keep your hair out of your face. If you want a simple hot style take a little bit of hair from ONE side of your head/hair and braid it, then pin it back. It looks cute on long, down hanging hair. Side pony tails are adorable too. Just not two pig tails, or a part right down the middle of your head. That style looks bad ! =)    Hope I helped! =)|`|IDVFsy5waa	idk|`|tfTQ6Cuuaa	pick your best feature and emphasize it, your eyes for example. play up that feature and go very simple with the rest. wear you hair down, long hair looks so pretty down and layered.    and most importantly, be confident in yourself! confidence exudes sexiness.
mMvEEZ3oaa	drink a lot of water  use a toothbrush and sugar, and use it on your lips|`|KQjBLyU3aa	Try Vaseline instead of chapstick, and I heard Carmex works great too. You can find them really cheap in little bottles at places like Target. Good luck!|`|zSOP5hcOaa	try carmex its really good|`|EQaGQ6hWaa	put on vasline at night before you sleep it really helps me caz i have the same thing and it worked out to be great|`|deAyKj2Uaa	when you go to bed at night, put some vaseline on your lips.  it will have all night to soak into your lips and in the morning, your lips will feel great.  then, during the day if your lips feel chapped, try a little spread of blistex silk and shine.  it stays on your lips for hous and it not too heavy.  whatever you do... good luck! :) :)|`|6wxgyGy5aa	Lightly brush your lips with your toothbrush whenever you brush your teeth.  Then apply vaseline to your lips.  It works quite well.  A friend of mine had horribly chapped lips and was always using Chapstick etc but was told that your lips grow dependent on the added moisture you get from it...so maybe try cutting down on it a little|`|CDFz2Yjvaa	Put on vaseline before you go to bed and after you wake up|`|mX34bDWtaa	You should try abreva|`|itiJVgRsaa	i have this problem too. stick to a lip moisturizer with oils in it  like burt bees or CGBigalow co. from bath and body works. that's the only ones that work for me. avoid anything that is like a lip balm. don't get flavored either it just makes you lick your lips which dries them out more. hope this helps. =) also exfoliate your lips every other day/night and then apply your moisturizer. if you have dead skin on your lips then the product won't work to it's fullest. good luck.|`|wPucIiwjaa	brush your lips with a soft toothbrush and then put LOTS of carmex on before bed.  oh and drink lots of water because you could be dehydrated.  And if you lick your lips a lot stop, it makes it worse.|`|LAanaXmraa	use chap stick that has petroleum jelly in it.  or you can try coating your lips with skin moisturizer, vitamin E oil, or aloe Vera gel.  if your going outside use chap stick with sunblock.  avoid licking your lips.  drink a lot of water throughout the day to keep hydrated.    At night, gently exfoliate lips by rubbing them softly with a dry toothbrush or washcloth. If you prefer, you can make a paste of baking soda and water and apply to lips before exfoliating. Follow with a thick coating of petroleum jelly before going to bed. After just a few nights, you should see a marked improvement.      Eat healthy cracked lips can be a symptom of a riboflavin deficiency. you can try taking vitamin b if your already eating healthy.      hope this helps.
6RgghI66aa	I think I know what kind of shirt you're talking about. You can either wear a white or black cami/ undershirt under it. A plain black/ white shirt that can be dazzled up by a long beaded necklace either brown white or black....or a small necklace with a pair of earrings that can be silver or gold. As for the bottom jeans or dressy pants with boots or shoes of your choice. It's you who'll be wearing it...have fun have plenty of styles to choose!!!|`|6JD1KKYcaa	under your cute shirt???  hmmm... a white tube dress would go fab with it.  then paired it with a one- inch heeled strappy sandal.  or a flip-flop would be okay for a very casual look.    or you can wear a beige tube under it, paired with white capri pants, and brown plaid flats (like those ballet shoes).|`|oHO0XOQVaa	Do you mean it cuts off just under the breast area??  Er, if that's the case, you don't wear it.|`|ikXqf20saa	I don't really understand the shirt...at all...but colors like bright blue, light pink, and white go with brown.    You could wear the brown top with a bright blue top under it  dark wash skinny jeans  and either brown boots or flats OR blue flats|`|ekF4YVMiaa	Black skinny's && Flats
50L0dfpGaa	There is a store here called Dick's sporting goods, I don't know if yall have those or not...but they have a ton of columbia clothing. Also maybe cabella's, or bass pro shops, either of those three...again, I don't know if yall have them or not, but they are all really good stores. Hope I helped!|`|QcX4fugiaa	my grandma could find one for you in colombia!|`|YGpciehTaa	trailblazer
tPJlb5lJaa	I have super curly hair! So this is what I do.    1.Don'tt shower in hot, hot water. Shower in cool to almost a little warm, that will make it a little less frizzy.    2.I use Tresemmee curly, and it works really good too.     What do you use?|`|AA10378447	I also like Humectress, but you need a leave-in creme conditioner, or some other styling aid like Bed Head.|`|hQNHzc6faa	Herbal Essence Hello Hydration or any Aussie Conditioner|`|26lZZaWNaa	nexxus humectus, or etae carmel treatment|`|ATr65Uszaa	JELL I USE JELL FOR MY CURLY PUFFY HAIR LOL IT TAMS IT LOL|`|lr3xiGohaa	Try biosilk it leaves hair soft and mannageable. Try putting a serum in it. People always coplement my hair. It's wavy and very long and very hydrated. I use biosilk shampoo andd conditioner. Then right after i get out the shower I put either Paul Mitchell hair serum, or Fantasia serum (the red one) Also ,DO NOT STRAIGHTEN OR BLOW DRY YOUR HAIR!! it will only make the frizz worse.|`|pzwz6f9uaa	head and shoulders did it for me.   try it out and if that doesnt meet  your expectations try sunsilk i heard its good
wwSz1ht5aa	liquid eyeliner|`|hpX4up0maa	I agree with her
ncPdftafaa	you're pretty girl!  what brand are those?  they look good.  get green|`|iZf62jacaa	ok well color contacts are really bad for your eyes. they can also earatate your eyes more easely. if i were to git them (i wont) i would go with the grey.|`|6mf4yy92aa	hazel with that kind of dark hair it makes your eyes pop and look more natural|`|LCcW7KSsaa	I think I like the grey better. The hazel kind of scares me.|`|kS7JqjPzaa	Grey|`|aClEgPgMaa	Gray. You would look even better with less eyeliner.|`|lKZoOXpwaa	grey!|`|OyKdxttbaa	blue|`|9ni90gyVaa	blue|`|6vZ2H7Uhaa	grey|`|eWhtZQUBaa	GREEN  would make you look like "the jungle girl" look i like that    is your name sheena queen of the jungle! JK lolol
tSMRYe8waa	You can do one or the other. If you relax your hair you should only need to do so every 6 weeks|`|YAwvszITaa	you will be sorry if you do that your hair will get so damaged. Don't do it. You should not do those things so often|`|N1LYWbHFaa	do not get a relaxer in your hair every month and extensions because it will extremely damage your hair|`|26lZZaWNaa	you should never perm your hair monthly, it dries your hair out and over processes it. It should be permed every six to eight weeks.Now, do you mean braided extensions or weave extension. Braided extensions are not good with a perm. Weave extensions are perfect with perms. To keep your hair soft and not having to be permed every month, use nexxus shampoo and nexxus humectus conditioners/ I'm mixed as well and I have been getting perms every eight weeks for more than 40 years. (my mom started when I was 5).|`|7euKjvG9aa	No. No one should get extensions and a relaxer every month, that'll damage your hair. Once every six to eight weeks or more for relaxers. With extensions, follow a stylist's suggestions.|`|f5a1KnMaaa	You should only relax no sooner than 6 weeks, i recommend 2 months wait. You can get clip-in extensions regularly with a relaxer with no damage. if you are doing a sew-in i don't see why you would need to relax so much and this would be damaging also. You can also glue-in extensions, but glue does take your hair out.|`|W88S5Xjiaa	Do not relax your hair! I got one and it broke of my hair 3 inches! I'm growing it out now and it takes so long! But my hair is healthier and looks A LOT better! Do not get one because you will regret so much! Trust me!
63s3G8YUaa	Yes, it looks really cool too. Here is how. She is using bleach from England by the way.   http://www.chictopia.com/photo/show/8734|`|NE3vbxHNaa	ya of course

I have to admit it is a nice dress, and everyone has different opinions, so don't be disencouraged that, that isn't THE dress.

ckIQfT2saa	your pretty but i will comment on the fact that i can tell that you used to be a blond    your eyebrows are super lighter than your hair, i would recomend going back to blond or using an eyebrow pencil to darken your eyebrows to match with your hair|`|kdMM7OAaaa	you need like electric colors, or neon for clothing, bright things like that., for make up do an earth tone theme, but make it dark. for you hair you should wear it down and add like bows- every one at my school has been wearing baby bows- as odd as it sounds, it is really cute. you should either dye your hair back to blond tho or use an eyebrow pencil because your hair makes your eyebrows contrast OUT. and btw ur really pretty! good luck hope i helped|`|vhr9KVmqaa	a red dress would be stunning|`|e1FnEHRpaa	dye your eyebrows because they are too light for your hair. Use mascara and eye liner.  for you i would stick to darker colors for wardrobe. let your hair down.  just try things out. google styles, try out colors and play it up.  hope it helps :]|`|WlClgiIfaa	Have a pretty Friday, I have one of those like maybe once a month and it shocks people because I don't usually wear like a dress or a lot of make-up so yeah try one of those, other than that your really pretty
92iuiuZKaa	Good idea.     Very easy|`|8U1aivfwaa	bald is best   use a norelco arcitec|`|y8jIXgOdaa	do it|`|wPOBL5Lhaa	it wont work, it hurts alot.|`|Zu2oVVhoaa	shaving your genitals isnt the best idea! One of my friends got a urinary infection from shaving that! also I know you get extremely ichy an uncomfortable! Not the best thing to be in public! If your going to do it anyway I recomend just getting a bikini wax! they know what they are doing and your better off. Putting metal sharp blades near there isnt smart! I mean what if you slipped? major ouchie!!!|`|bNRUjnGZaa	When I shave I use an old fashioned plain razor, electric ones irritate my face.

TsmqhvZHaa	afro|`|hcC1tMwraa	a fountin! put lots of coloured clips in it...|`|aSP60sZraa	black with blonde highlights.|`|cLSdkHZOaa	dreads! and then you could pull it back into a ponytail to make it look presentable! hehe jk.  how about just a small strip of a crazy color in your hair, maybe like red or something?|`|MSfsg9dBaa	ahahahaha story of my life. Well...I would say maybe a fohawk? those are fun because if you're going some place profesional you could just comb it down. Or have you considered an asymetrical style? those are stylish but not too crazy. Or even a few tastefully placed pink or purple highlights in the front could be really cool. And of course you could always go for the daring, super short look like Rihanna. But think hard before you do anything crazy...I've done some pretty insane awful things to my poor hair.    good luck!
5nvgGbcmaa	hmm...  very sharply defined features (like a really angular face or something)  short straight and spiky hair (usually darker hair for some reason)  well-fitting and colorful but simple clothing   small-ish  bright eyes... use some eyeliner and nice eyeshadow and stuff|`|PS2JLw6eaa	When I think of pixies, I think of short, blonde pixies cuts, sparkles, bright makeup, and pink lips.    and for clothes, it makes me think of cute, flowy tops, and dresses.    hope that helped :)|`|QnSKaBcjaa	i think petite, small features, and cute.|`|kdfQmu40aa	Short blonde hair. Skinny, hourglass shape body.

If you want to know how she looks you can Google it, or you can watch the movie online.
4YFFb2kGaa	i agree that is soo annoying !  i get if you go in there maybe once during lunch for a minutes and cheak out how you looks thats fine, even i do that. but spending that much time on how you looks, gets anoying. My friend does that, and even more anoying is when im with her i have to wait for her and she points out all the things she hates about how she looks, so that i would tell her that she is prettyand so that she get compliment. like example: her: omg i hate my face me( being the good friend i am) : what are you talking about your so pretty !    people should stop caring sooo much about how they look and get outside and enjoy life!|`|JdFgf575aa	no.|`|bvt9kvS8aa	I do that too..but so do my friends so its cool.  its not annoying.|`|nRYVWkpEaa	ummm, just because she doesn't wanna spend too much time caking up her face doesn't make her a tomboy.    &yes, that would annoy me, it's NOT just you.  Just go outside without them :)  I'm sure not ALL of your friends do that.   Just go outside with your other friends.    I think girls need to rely less on make.up.   I rarely wear any, and I'm not dead!   haha.    Anyway, yesss, that's annoying, and I'm sorry for you lol.      **EDIT :: YES!  Firespark--girls only go crazy with make.up for guys (as far as I know anyway) when in reality guys SAY that they don't like girls with "all that gross stuff" on their faces. haha, I'm just quoting here.|`|Qxmpn9Gtaa	It doesn't bug me much but it really bugs me when I have to stand there for 5-10 minutes just to wash my hands because no one will move.|`|no9BzhhLaa	ummhh nooo i doo that..itss just you!|`|9ni90gyVaa	no.. i did that when i was in high school... your probably a tomboy|`|e68a6a673385cf8ff6673cecb42f930aaa	I wouldn't be annoyed.|`|7mmmGytpaa	haha, girls do that at my school too; they either stand in the stall (so you can't use it) to look in the mirrors that are high, or spread all their crap over the sinks so you can't wash your hands.. yeah i stop to look in the mirror but i don't need to apply my makeup every hour :/|`|f9488cf6c54eb1381e37dcd867602ea9aa	only if it blocks me from washing my hands in the sink (the mirrors are in front of the sink)....then I find it annoying  other than that, they just wanna reassure themselves that they look...you know, good    oh and about your friends, go hang out with your other friends (who don't spend the whole lunch in the bathroom) if it annoys you that much|`|K9z6Pcw6aa	well it is very normal for girls to do this it keeps them from feeling a little insecure about yourself i bet atleast one of your friends wants to leave too you can just leave and someone might follow.|`|Ezf2Oq8vaa	LOLOL. okay. this question is pretty intresting and yes i would be annyoed and no im not a tomboy okay? some girls are bishes like that  they do everything on purpose you cant use the sink and if its blocking the way i just stand there looking at them like HELLO DUH IM TRYING TO WASH MY HANDS. they would like so move away AHAHA. :P and other than that i wouldnt hate it cuhs its just annoying when they like block the sink when someone finish taking a freaken dump or like freaken finish touching their period LOLOL ROFL they need to wwash upp ;D|`|vD7AAkUFaa	I find it annoying, like i look in the mirror two seconds and then leave. Gosh go find new friends...AND your not a tomboy, all the people that said you were one are probably plastic doll girls.|`|LLhLEIUAaa	no and I would probably do the same thing..except not until lunch ends.|`|EytUZvyiaa	Hell, yes! I am far from a girly girl, so I personally can't understand why anyone would spend an hour in front of a mirror doing their makeup!

AA10849332	you've probably got a hypertrophic scar.    hypertrophic scars aren't unusual with cartilage piercings and will eventually go away.    go to a piercer and have them check it our and also check your jewelry for any nicks...which can irritate the piercing and actually cause the scarring.    diluted tea tree oil can be used, but you should only do it once a day.     crustiness isn't unusual and should be expected with any piercing.    sea salt soaks (if you aren't already doing them) should be done twice a day for cleaning. mix 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt per 8 oz of water.      it depends on how you take care of your piercing how the healing will go. I don't know how long you've had your cartilage pierced.    ice and ibuprofen will help with swelling|`|kogfFMgmaa	o its not a big deal. i got a cartilage piercing and its always gonna get swollen and then theres gonna be a bump around it for like a year. and most ear piercings get kinda crusty just rub some rubbing alcohol or just water on it with a q-tip. tea bags wont help ever.|`|wz3S190haa	yup mine did that i had two done at the same time on the same ear,its really not that bad its just healing if its red and crusty wich is good. i used to take a shot glass and fill it with warm salt water, put a paper towle under my ear, and just kinda suction cup it over my peaircing and hold it there for about 10 minutes...it clears infection and helps it heal really fast...also any antiseptic was is awsome. just take something to ease the pain and dont sleep on that ear haha...and if this is bad to you, DONT GET  A BRIDGE OR A SEPTOM PEIRCING|`|o503YPrqaa	Its not a pimple.. Its a Keloid. Here is a link on wiki ew dont look at the pic. and I have had one before Tea Tree Oil has worked great for me!    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keloid    Ew the pics are 3rd world country pics. Don't worry. Anyway Tea Tree Oil from GNC will help it out alot. also sea salt soaks are great.|`|Nytn8HB8aa	It is NOT a zit.     I wonder if you got your piercing done with a gun (as opposed to a needle).     My guess would be scar tissue. It's actually pretty common. If you'll just keep doing your aftercare, minimize touching/playing with the earring and   avoid sleeping on the piercing, it should heal. If the bump stays, don't worry.     If it becomes painful or starts leaking pus (especially colored pus) you need to call or visit your piercer and see what (s)he says. (S)he'll know exactly what to do, whether it's taking the ring out or going to a doctor for antibiotics or whatever.|`|qX4Z9ncpaa	plz dont tell me you got it done with a gun... that can scare you ear and shatter you cartilage. so just use sea salt spray(available in most peicering shops) and spray ONLY 3 TIMES A DAY spray to much and you can reverse the healing affect|`|H7kmp0qdaa	use sea salt or sterile saline spray for cuts found a drug stores on it twice daily. Do not touch it under any circumstance unless you are cleaning it and wash your hands before you do so. Usually bumps on piercings are a result of bumping or slightly ripping it accidentally. Try to sleep on the other side of your head and make sure you wash your pillow covers every few days so bacteria and oil from your hair aren't getting in there. Good luck!|`|JfumPukYaa	sounds like an infection... clean it 3x a day with luke warm water and then use an antibacterial cream...keep it covered.    If its more like a bump or boil u might need to see a dr  http://www.piercings-body.com/boils_and_...|`|uuJcoHE5aa	put rubbing achohal twice a day and apply a warm cloth on it|`|zROjHRa7aa	just a lil infected. my mom tried popping my sisters with a pin. lol. DONT DO IT! SHE SAID IT HURTS LIKE HELL  lol. mayb some alcohol to dry it up. but not IN the piercing. thatll sting. then put some vitamin E on it to make it go away... LIKE MAGIC!!! lol.

I have found that Secret Clinical Strength works well.....it doesn't keep me totally dry, but it keeps me a lot dryer than any other deodorant I have used.  Put it on at night, like the instructions say and if you want, put a bit more on in the morning after you shower.|`|sL5CY6Q7aa	try antipersperant. thats all i can say about that :/ but the doctor prescribes acne stuff that works way better than OTC creams.|`|u1FlCXL0aa	same here, i get it from my mom  *thanks genes*  anyway you need to change your deodorant every 2 weeks  by clinical straighten secret, then clinical dove, and certain dry  PICK 2 OF THOSE 3  apply one for 2 weeks MORNING AND NIGHT  after two weeks SWITCH  again apply morning and night  then after  more weeks switch back to the other one  and so on and so on  if that doesnt work see a doctor|`|bogfZ6Xsaa	I used to sweat through every shirt I wore from the sleeve of the tshirt to the top of my boobs. I used Maxim deodorant from the internet (kinda spendy,but sooooo worth it) and I haven't sweat since! As for the acne...probably hormonal, but try Aveeno the soap bar it's only $2.50 at Walmart and it's very mild and see if that works! Hope this helps!|`|E9fwrBKHaa	Doctor will help. He/she will probably prescribe you medicine. (forgot what it is called just ask them bout it.) They can give you medicine for both.|`|yEohiFtiaa	see a doctor hun if in doubt it's the best thing 2 do
HhmhSBpgaa	you can touch it and the hair moves with it but it will still hold your style without being stiff or sticky.|`|y8jIXgOdaa	it holds it together.. but its not really stiff. like rock hard, it will move.|`|WVyaBzcdaa	it wont get that hard crunchy feeling, its able to move and look natural.

That hair is normal and you shouldnt be emberrased by it. He's gonna take u by suprise one day and it wont be trimmed. Think about it.......|`|LCcW7KSsaa	If you have never shaved it before you are in for a surprise. The first day it will be so soft and awesome. But it will grow back like a 5'o clock shadow and it will suck. It will be all hard and hurt. Although I hate doing it, it IS a really nice gesture and it's ridiculous HOT when there is no hair down there. Especially in the gooch area. Do it in the shower but make sure you run water on it for a while to soften it up. Shave like you would normally shave but use a fresh razor. If you think you will be prone to razor bumps, use something that a shave cream or gel that works for that. I also put acne astringent on afterwards which helps with ingrown hairs. Gooooooood luck!|`|FjdU3gzpaa	You should trim it because completely shaving it isn't right and leaving it isn't either.    You should do it as soon as possible since you might meet him who knows.. tomorrow?|`|MQf80RUgaa	wow. ohh man.|`|u6btDDWZaa	ask your bf|`|PNA7f0q3aa	Shave it but leave some on the top.|`|yngXCPjEaa	Getting it waxed is the most prefered way, but you can also shave if you want.|`|FSKiPO1Laa	sure i shave mine.|`|uexS1cXgaa	Shave it.

pnHkFv5iaa	It's not a one time thing. I tan enough that I can see the outline of the sticker just barely and put it back on the same place when I tan again and it grows more evident the more I tan. If you have issues tanning, I suppose they're really hard to use and girls with that problem just don't use them.    Man those things are a butt to fade, too.

AA12059671	Warm colors are based on yellows, oranges, browns, yellowish greens, orangish reds, and the like.    Cool colors are based on blues, greens, pinks, purples, blue-greens, magentas, and blue-based reds.     I've included a site for you to get more information|`|m72ZD6AJaa	Think about an object, in space, with a light source. If the sun is shining on a ball, what colors do you think you could paint on that area of the surface, aside from white (because, technically, white is a value, not a color)? Colors that are bright in hue are yellow, orange, red and any variants thereof. Since they are reminiscent of the sun, these colors are referred to as "warm" (get it, sun = sunlight = warm?).     Colors that are referred to as "cool" are associated with what would be the shadow part of the ball, where the light doesn't shine. Colors that are included as "cool" are purple, blue and green.|`|y8jIXgOdaa	warm colors= red, yellow, orange, pink|`|KkT74UsPaa	Like Red, Dark Oragne, u no think of fire|`|QtHUHno1aa	warm-red,yellow,orange  cold-blue,purple,green|`|c5NQ4QCEaa	Red, yellow and orange are warm colors.

Because if you notice the spaghetti straps or tank tops, they dont have them. But if you look at nice dresses or tubetops, they will most likely always have them. But for some reason, i notice allot of girls rip them off. lol, i dont know why the heck they do that, maybe its because they pop out every once in a while. But dont worry, allot of people ask that question. Take care. If you have anymore questions like this or anything, feel free to email me.|`|KwvGRvYWaa	the loops and or strands on the side of a dress are for a hanger so if you were to hang it you would secure it by the loops.|`|XuFH8oNfaa	Are you talking about the little loops attached to the shoulders of some shirts and dresses? Usually they are either clear or black... they are actually there to help you hang the item. This is typically because the item is possibly cut too wide in the neck to be hung or just too delicate so it should not be hung by the shoulders. Sometimes you'll even see it done this way in stores... the loops are hung over the center of the hanger and then the garment is placed around the ends like any other piece of clothing.|`|6RgghI66aa	The loops/strands on the side of the dress are so that you can put the dress easily on the hanger with no problems. When I was around the pretten years I always cut them out for no reason. Now I realize they're for importance. When you put the dress on, make sure the loops/ strands are inside the dress and can't be seen, a trick is to wrap the strands on the side of the bra, so it can't come out.|`|ZEvtVkuuaa	Hanger-friendly. Cut them bitches off.

I think whichever you are more comfortable with is your best option.  I've always preferred a man with some chest hair though|`|zkT5AYNXaa	the keyword is DEPENDS!    there are really sexy guys with hairy chest and really sexy guys with smooth chest. it depends on the form of your body, the type and ammount of hair etc.  personally i prefer a hairy chest. my boyfriend has it and i love to fall a sleep with my face on his chest. but he has it in a perfect ammount, he's not like a gorilla (on that cases they can allways trim it and its great)    anyway think about it because you can screw it like for example Jack on LOST. he looks horrible after he shaved his chest imo..    if you are in a relationship talk to your girlfriend about it! her oppinion is more important than anyone's here.

6Yjvtf2laa	the smaller the gauge the better so 16.  and just soak the piercing and the needle in alcohol [that you would use for cuts]  wash your mouth out with a mouth wash with a high alcohol content,  it kills germ and numbs your mouth some.  a safety pin is thicker than a sewing needle and will make it easier to put the ring in.  the faster you go the less it hurts so dont do that little by little crap.  good luck      to the person below me a 14 is bigger than a 16, duh.|`|QKW3aHGUaa	A 16 is smaller, so that would probably work better.

245a398a155d56fcce22628155b73604aa	I started using eye creams during my early twenties. My dermatologist says there is nothing wrong with using eye creams even at an early age, given it has no harmful chemicals. It's just similar to using lotion, it moisturizes the skin and help you avoid wrinkles when you get earlier.    Also, make sure your wrinkle cream has sunscreen, since one of the major causes of wrinkles is sun exposure.|`|1IIY1Ds6aa	not until you're at least 50|`|K9z6Pcw6aa	Start with a neutrogena brand then you can go to an olay cream if it doesn't help

I was having the same problem until I first heard about root lifting sprays on this beauty website, primped.com.au. I tried it and it worked a treat for me. My hair's probably not as dead straight as yours, but it does sit really flat naturally.  You should try Kiehl's Super Thick Volumiser. Just spray it into the roots of your hair when its semi-wet and then dry it with a hairdryer. I hope it works for you!
dxeb0BfBaa	I studied hair to be a hairdresser lol long time ago now!     the best products to use are professional. my favourites are:    TIGI Catwalk- Oatmeal & Honey Treatment Shampoo & Conditioner  TIGI Bedhead- Moisture Maniac Shampoo & Conditioner  (budget) Nexxus Therappe & Humectress    commercial products such as Fructis & Pantene are often bad for your hair although the short term effects are brilliant, they may in the long run worsen your problem. Straightening is a NO NO for your type of hair (I should know, its my type of hair too). the heat smooths the cuticle so it lays flat & your hair appears shiny & healthy but it dries the hair which is the last thing you need! a regular hair cut is also essential (every 6-8weeks) & if you colour you hair make sure its done by a professional and only every have the roots retouched. If you like your hair straight you could ask you stylist about permanent straightening or silk/keratin infusion which means you wouldnt have to worry about your frizzies until your straightener grows out. Silk/keratin infusion is the safest & healthiest way to permanently straighten your hair although it is a very new technology & not many people are educated in this field. With chemical permanent straightening the key is to use the same moisturising shampoos & conditioners to keep your hair a healthy as possible.|`|lkNJNnlSaa	You can study hair?|`|26lZZaWNaa	the best products that I have ever used are Nexxus|`|dKXfYc2maa	i used to have the curliest and frizziest air ever and i started to you Gariear Futis ( i think that's how you spell it ) slink and shine

It has salicylic acid in it which is a acne medication. It's oil free and doesn't leave a greasy feel.    Here's what it looks like: http://www.manekineko.us/catalog/images/...|`|GGAgxzJNaa	It's not going to happen by Friday, I'm afraid.  And I'm no expert, but there's a really good chance that wearing your hair like that is what caused the acne on your forehead in the first place.|`|jBc3PaGLaa	yeah, i say toothpaste too. just put a little bit, not too much, cuz it could dry out your skin. leave it for about an hour, then rinse it off completely. the redness will be gone, but it wont clear all of your acne. itll just be much less noticable.|`|NCvX4I0baa	Sorry my computer is being really weird and slow, so I can't check out all the pics. I only saw the one where there is mild acne on your forehead and then the one with your hair covering them. I know hair covers it up.. but it's not a good thing to have your hair like that because your hair has oil that causes more acne.    All you can do is use any cream that has worked, or else keep your face clean and clear of hair when possible and don't stress, because that creates more acne.|`|Jr9j5f6naa	honestly, your acne is really terrible or anything. I would suggest washing your face gently with warm water in the morning to open up your pores. then wash it with "oil free acne wash; pink grapefruit foaming scrub" from neutrogena. It works good, and makes your face feel fresh because it foams up really well. then afterwards, try Biore "triple action astringent" again, works well because it's light & it oil free, so it won't feel weird & sticky like a lot of other astringents do. Then for a moisturizer (you need it even if your skin is oily) try "shine control moistrurizer" also from Biore. It's great for oily skin because it makes it feel soo light and oil-free. be sure to close up your pores afterwards by splashing cold water on your face.      I know people usually don't buy the things that people suggest over the internet, but I strongly suggest it. My acne looks like yours, and I've had it for probably 2 years, so I know how you feel. However, don't expect to get it all clear by friday.|`|9wmne6lGaa	get a cleanser, and toner.  it' s not going to clear up by friday.|`|BBws5hl7aa	whipe pee on your face!!!!  it really works!!!!!  jk!|`|bVIdoq6Baa	if u live in australia i have no idea if they have this in america  try clearasil pimple/acne cream. anything with benzac will help  if you have enough time go to the doctor and they can prescribe you something.|`|hvp9goB3aa	Hmm, may need to find some skin creams. Proactive face mask thing works really really good|`|ikkTcqPFaa	start washing your face!|`|ODLpANuPaa	If you have acne that is hard to get rid of, I suggest you try proactiv.  (go to proactiv.com)  I had class 5 acne and have been using Proactiv for 2 years and my face has been clear since the first week of using it!!! its amazin!|`|qUUtj4DFaa	if u put on toothpaste on ur zits and let in stay in over night (or during the day if ur not planning to go anywhere) and ur acne will clear up really quick|`|LwFBq0rCaa	use a layer of toothpaste over night to dry it. after school every hour wash it with good old fashion soap and water and don't wear make up it make it worse|`|OaxXT5nzaa	Benzole peroxide.  Look for it at the store in the active ingredients.  You might also want to get a good moisturizer too, because it can dry out your skin.  I had acne for years and I tried everything.  I went to a dermatologist, took some pills and now it's gone.  You should go to a doctor ASAP so that you can enjoy life without worrying about acne.|`|vfrYYjusaa	use proactive it works great but takes like 2 weeks, any treatment you use it will take long not just 2 days sry honey i'd say cover up but it washes off, idk if theres water proof cover up|`|Ho3qPApaaa	neutrogena stuff works really well. Faster and better than proactive.    crush up aspirin in a little water and put on your acne...that will reduce the redness if you can't rid of the acne.     :-) I hope that helps! p.s....I feel your pain!!!!!!!!|`|4Zw5XpVRaa	PROACTIVE SUCKS. just so you know. uhm well it will be hard to do by friday. just have a morning/ and night routine and stick to it. like a good facewash. over the counter stuff works really well. differen is great. but i would get this acnefree kit. try the acnefree severe. its like a four step process but it works amazing, it comes in an orange kit. try that but i would maybe see a dermatologist if you really wanna get it fixed. hah cover up is good to! hope  i help|`|6chm7jVvaa	Try Cetaphil but make sure you look and see the front if its normal to oily skin or for dry skin it works good. i use the normal to oily because i have oily skin. and i no someone who had bad acne and used this and her skin is beautiful now.|`|rESy0YKEaa	You wont be able to completely clear your skin by friday, but you can reduce it.  -Don''t go overboard on the oily snacks.  -Wash your face with a scrub that contains Benzoyl Peroxide (thats the active ingrediant in products like Proactive.) twice a day.  'OXY' has 10% B.P.  -use acne spot treatment that contains B.P. once a day.|`|6Yjvtf2laa	you break out on your forehead because of the way you wear your hair,  the oils from it get in your skin.  just wash your face regularly, and use a toner.  i understand that wearing it like that is your style, but when ever is not necessary just keep it out of your face.|`|st5reHVjaa	leave it.  im serious, leave it alone.  ur putting too much stuff on ur zits and they'll go away if u dont touch it and dont do anything to it and dont put any creams on it.  wash it with acne soap (like normal)  i doubt it'll totally clear up doing anything by friday.  but this is the best thing. u already put stuff on it, right? so dont anymore!  DONT TOUCH IT!!! oil and bacteria will make it worse    if anything, get some wet and wild makeup or toothpaste and hope for the best      good luck swimming!|`|zPFclJznaa	most people have acne, you just have to accept it. its not going to go away by friday. everyone knows what its like to have it, so its not a big deal. for long term results try medicines prescribed by a dermatologist. those are the best ones.|`|iFYDJyIZaa	There are no quick fix miracles.     Use over-the-counter creams with benzoperoxide in them. They're meant to treat acne.    Drinking lots of water also helps skin.    I doubt it'll be gone by Friday though, so you may wish to use some type of cover up makeup.|`|huHOpRLLaa	proactive  but u should of did that along time ago  you cant get rid of it or even reduce it that much in 2 days.  sorry|`|I6dcRgD6aa	wash your hands & massage it a little so your circulation will be good there than put fresh water on the area. Drink good healthy water & it will wash the toxins out. If you are constipated buy Fleet suppositories so you will let go of toxins but only use them for this or occasisionally. You have to put this up your butt. I just thought you ought to know incase you need to get someone else to get them for you.|`|0e31e274dedcb0423876e15778a66335aa	I like "Zapzyt" cream or  Neutrogena "on the spot" acne cream. Both can be found at most grocery or drug stores for around $5. You just apply the cream to the acne areas about twice a day, and should see signs of improvement after several uses.
ge5m59rdaa	My opinion, I like the second pair the best. (:  They're just the most flattering.  Next, would come the first pair, cause they're not bad either.  But, for the worst would be the fourth or fifth.  I don't know.  The fourth pair though, just don't look that good.    But, it's also going to be YOU that's wearing it.  So..in the end, you have to decide. :]    Hope that helps.|`|Qxmpn9Gtaa	Fave is the fourth pair, then first, the second, least fave is the third|`|GNPCDSSsaa	ICK!!!! i dont like any of those, but... i would go for the 2nd pair|`|EHOTOck5aa	If your more "scene" or emo, i'd go with the first pair.    If your the "cool" type, the 4th pair    If your really gothic-y, the 3rd pair =)|`|IngP8YMPaa	The second ones. the first are too feminine, the third make you seem like you are trying to be cool. the forth arent bad, but the second are my favourite|`|JbubP1Unaa	fourth pair most definitely!  i love colorful shoes, and those are the only ones with color, haha|`|4vhTUtVfaa	i like the second.|`|fI5j9cBlaa	I LOVE THE FIRST PAIR!!

And you can get large bottles at amazon.com for pretty cheap.|`|a4z1JHgLaa	Walmart or just about any where else that sells vitamins.  I don't think it gives you acne.

AA11244139	I hate wire hangers. Don't think they are in use much any more except in dry cleaning companies. They tend to bend at times, cloths fall off them, they rust over time. Plastic ones are cheap and different colors for different cloths if you wish to organize them|`|9JzsDSB1aa	NOOOO  They rust and they have stained my clothing!  plus they are just annoying|`|v0FlUan0aa	yes, they're okay. the clothes sometimes slide off|`|C5Wlt3rGaa	Nope.  I use plastic.  I have every single color of plastic hangers also.  The colors are randomly placed,   And it seems to brighten up my closet.|`|EHOTOck5aa	Wire  && plastic.      Wire whenever.    Plastic when im letting it air dry|`|27DsYKShaa	No, mine are plastic. :D|`|p7KbhFEeaa	I dont use wire hangers personally.. I use like almost fuzzy hangers so my clothing doesnt fall off. They stay on much better and are thiner so you can store more clothing. You can shop at bed, bath , and beyond for them.    http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product....    HERE IS A LINK TO BUY THEM OR LOOK AT THEM|`|zhFIDSULaa	Yes I do (:  ... I also use plastic(:    They seem to work fine.  Hold up pretty good!|`|g3hbEQ9Baa	Mine are wooden on the bottom with a wire hook...

JafLyLYgaa	I AM going to give my opinion. If you dont love him enough to marry him, then he isnt important enough to put it on your body for the rest of your life (at least not YET he isnt). I just wanted to put that in perspective.     I'm not a fan of foot tattoos personally, keep it really small if you get it on the foot, large ones never look right to me.     I cant believe I'm saying this, but I think a tattoo like this might look good in the lower back/hip area.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	Foot tattoos hurt and fade easily. I would go for somewhere else, like on your shoulder. That way you can add to it later on.|`|uzmcXWSVaa	how about the top of your back to the right or left side, or just in the middle.    cute tattoo, btw|`|zLVZyfwUaa	I won't give you my opinion on the name thing, however, I do have a tattoo on my foot and it does hurt worse than anything else I have had done (ribcage, shoulder, lower back and ankle)  Mine has aged well (I've had it 4 years now and it is still vibrant)  HOWEVER, some things to take into consideration, how much sun you get, do you have dry skin, and is the artist using good quality inks.  Also some shops will not do feet tattoos because as a rule they don't weather well.|`|ToeeUGZUaa	I think its a great idea that your getting the crown. The foot, lower back, and your sides are the most painfull place to get it.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Okay, you asked me not to give an opinion, so I won't....    If you want it on the top of your foot, then get it on the top of your foot. Nobody can help you with this. Everybody has different tastes. Some love lower back tattoos, some want chest pieces, some want upper back, some want arms. I'm not you, so I can't help you. Imagine your life with this tattoo in various different places and see which scenario you prefer.
44lXlXeMaa	I think Brown or a Black Tee would look Fab. Maybe even a White would work. hope i can help|`|AhtaOu9aaa	white shirt maybe navy blue with the khaki

6quRjsHGaa	Underwear has absolutely no effect on your health.  The test that was carried out, about the sperm count, showed no difference when it came to different underwear.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	when you wear underwear that is too tight then the package stays warm which is bad for your sperm. boxers are better if you are trying to conceive|`|C5Wlt3rGaa	Tight underwear can lower your sperm count.  If you want to have a baby,  I would suggest wearing boxers or something loose.
kdr8XCBnaa	Sorry I wasn't able to see any of the links.    I have some great suggestions for a possible necklace for a "simple black dress"    I buy jewelry from this site, this is the most unique jewelry I've ever found, it's all handmade glass jewelry. Here is a couple of pieces I've had my eye one. Take a look:    http://www.aleynajewelry.com/product.php...    http://www.aleynajewelry.com/product.php...    This last one has a really great story behind the mediterranean eye, I really love something with a history behind it. :)    But you really have to check out all the other pieces on the website, it all beautiful!|`|IngP8YMPaa	none of the links work...|`|dfTMaV58aa	go to American Egeal
tzMMFPr4aa	6 weeks|`|HgRYP3cJaa	smart move. ring  moves  around a lot and takes ages to heal. stud will heal in a few months, depending on how YOUR body heals (fast/slow).  go back to the shop to switch them.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	I started with a stud, but 2 days after getting it my nose ring fell out in my sleep. I forced a nose ring (hoop) through it that morning. It hurt really bad, but I did it. Yes, it got a little infected but it healed up real good.     Why not just find a piercer who is willing to start you on a hoop? I am sure they exist.|`|1oiZwj50aa	I had a nose piercing once, when I had my nose pierced they did it with a ball closure ring.|`|FOF9JSpbaa	they tell you to wait 15 days but i changed it 8 days later|`|Of6Qs2Zfaa	about three weeks if you keep it clean and turn it regularly.
Au4gWgEiaa	What do you want to know?  I've had mine for 4 months now and it's great!  To me the piercing itself was painless and it felt like it wasn't even there once the barbell was in.  Be careful when washing your face or drying your hair that it doesn't get caught though!  That's the only times that I am truly aware that I have it!    If you do get it done, get it done by a professional.  It's just more sanitary and you want it to look good, right?      If you are looking for how it is done, here is a clip (it has no sound though), and not all piercers use a clamp:    http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=j68i6nBwL6...    To clean it, I just use regular unscented soap (it has no irritants) and clean around the holes and rinse it off well.  Sea salt soaks are great to do too because they promote healing.    Hope this helps you out :)|`|c5anDswjaa	Piercings are the bomb and everyone should know that and not be hating on them, first of all.    Secondly, I got my eyebrow pierced about 3 years ago.. It was a very easy process, didnt hurt at all.. But healing took a long time, not because of the piercing, my body just doesnt heal piercings as quickly as it should.. I had no rejection or anything like that.. I always thought eyebrow piercings was kind of boyish, but then I saw a pretty girl with one and decided it wasnt just for the boys or rocker chicks..    If you want it, go for it.. Just make sure you get it done professionally and take care of it like they tell you on the aftercare sheet|`|Z9aEClXnaa	people told me not to get them. people who had them told me they hurt when getting them and never ended up wanting them. if you want to no alot about them look them up on the computer.|`|9hcWEqk2aa	the look awful and stupid and if u get 1 your officially emo|`|vYDSmapoaa	My friend has her done and she likes but it destoryed her eyebrow line.|`|SG27rfSdaa	My friend had one but she removed it for a job and now can't put it back in.  I prefer ear, nose, belly button to eyebrow|`|uAWx5sz0aa	my friend has eyebrow piercings but he removed them since it was uncomfortable and it got infected.|`|VH29BFuGaa	Message me or something on her if you 'wanna ask  a particular question about the piercing, I can  probably help you out a bit. Like any piercing they  have infection risk but you should be all good long  as you take care of it properly. Not extremely  painful or anything...|`|4YDli7Lzaa	An Eyebrow piercing is a surface piercing and as such will eventually push out of your skin and probably leave a scar.    Some surface piercing last a very long time while others do not. I have a navel piercing which is also a surface piercing and I'v had it for 5 years. A friend of mine, her navel piercing only lasted 3 months before it grew out.    Just know unlike a navel piercing your eyebrow is on your face and any scaring will be seen by everyone.|`|e08554e96b932e913d4953ff293f44e6aa	I got my eyebrow pierced four years ago after you get it pierced you just have to make sure that you keep it clean as you would with any  other piercing.   and be careful when getting dressed, getting your eyebrow ring caught on your shirt is very painful.   eyebrow piercings do take a long time to close once they are healed, I have had mine done like I said for about 4 years and although I haven't worn jewelry in it in like 2 years I can still get an eyebrow ring in it without a problem.  so don't listen to anyone with a negative opinion about eyebrow piercings, if your sure you want the piercing, I say go for it.
SHtMw45Laa	The average height of a runway model is from 5'9'' to 5'11'', though some exceptions are made for girl's who are slightly taller or shorter (i.e. Kate Moss, who is 5'7'').  The average weight for a runway model is normally from 110 to 130 pounds, though exceptions are also sometimes made for that as well.  The average measurements for a runway model are 32''-34'' bust 22''-26'' waist and 33''-36'' hips.  Plus Size runway models are normally anywhere from 145 to 185 pounds, and their measurements differ according to their height and weight.  For commercial and print modeling the heights and weights differ considerably.   Some commercial models also do runway, while others are only 5'2''.  You should look into Petite modeling, you may have some good luck there!  Hope this helped! ^-^|`|OHfZFR31aa	For model proportions, your hips need to be the same size or even smaller than your bust. Ideal measurements are 34-24-34 plus or minus an inch, 5'7" for commercial modeling and 5'9"+ for runway|`|kauRr6X8aa	Over 5'9 for run way.  If your BMI is under 18.9 you'll be lucky to be hired.   34-24-35 is about usual.  You're too short for starters.   Your BMI is alright.  If you've got an amazing face you could do print work, but otherwise, find another dream.|`|W88S5Xjiaa	Sorry, you are to short!

5e9013e4acd951c6275d5a2e7e92b516aa	Try the "smokey eye look" Pick a dark color such as a dark green or purple and blend it out. Also you can always try a brown eyeshadow, that usually looks very pretty on blondes.     Try looking up makeup tutorials on youtube as well. They will tell you step for step what to do---if you do not know what you're doing or want to see different ways people "do up there eyes."|`|pzwz6f9uaa	blonde girls with heavy dark eyeliner dont look so appealing   try using light shimmering eyeshadows  but blend them so it doesnt look caked on your face.|`|msVN7GBpaa	i love the black and gray smokey eyes on blondes and with a nude lip stick|`|n5wXTZFGaa	Eye Shadow:    You'll look best in lilac, beige, camel or peach shades of eye shadow.

HhmhSBpgaa	I have been doing hair for 20 years I have had people with the same problem. If you have the hair for this then take your bang line back further and recut bangs to lay over the ones that are to short you may have more bang thant you want but you won't walk around for months waiting for them to grow out. This will hide your shorter bangs, hope this helps.|`|HRvPoQzKaa	Just clip them back like this:  http://beunique.org/images/piccss%20061....    or like this:  http://i204.photobucket.com/albums/bb262...    You could straighten them but that will cause damage.    There's NOTHING to help speed hair growth. Hair grows an inch every month.|`|10EXUriqaa	aw that sucks....if it makes yopu feel better my hair was cut to an inch long! over the summer....it was dreadful!    anyway you can clip back the bangs, or gel them out and try to style them nicer, or gel them to the side a little    everynight massage your scalp where the hair is...ive heard that it promotes growth|`|w7m52T9Waa	straighten your bangs and either slightly point them in or out.|`|26lZZaWNaa	the only way to promote hair growth is scalp stimulation and protein. This mean getting the blood vessels in your scalp flowing. Massage your scalp daily for a few mins. with your finger tips to get the blood flowing. And there are two types of vitamins that promote hair growth when used with the scalp stimulation, they are biotin vitamins or nixxon pills. Gastric bypass patients who loose their hair due to rapid weight loss, use biotin vitamins for hair growth and massage their scalps.|`|Sga6uU4Zaa	pin your bangs back  =)|`|GXKCtmLraa	i just got a haircut today and the same thing happend to me! my bangs are WAY to short and i usally have stick straight hair but my bangs are ALL wayvy!  im thinking of pining them up!  u should striaghten them (idont have enought time tho LOL!)  they will be longer and striaght   my sister didthat and it looks great! :D  HOPE I HELPED!|`|AA10689703	i think you should straighten your hair (bangs)|`|kK8JAMvUaa	Put mayo on it. Egg works too.  lol. :)|`|41UtJiaMaa	okay, so you cant just 'speed it up.' but you CAN make them look longer and keep them healthy so you dont slow down the growing process.    one way, is to straighten them ALOT. and comb them. combing stretches out the hair to its farthest extent better then just plain brushing. straightening them not only stretches them as well, but can make them lay flatter.    another tip is to just wear your bang back some days. or wear a ponytail with your bangs back.  hair grows ABOUT an inch a month so not much longer and they will be fine.    but the only thing you can do now is try your best to keep your hair healthy. you can find many articles on how to keep up with your hair.    if you hair is unhealthy, it will be partially dead, therefore, wont grow as fast enough.    hope i helped!|`|vqM01n5gaa	Try taking prenatal vitamins. It won't work right away but in about two months you'll notice your hair and nails are stronger and growing faster. Try getting bobby pins and pinning it back if it's long enough or styling your hair differently. It will take about 2-3 months but after that they should be long enough so you can pin them to the rest of your hair.|`|wJoMKfvqaa	if you want your bangs to look longer until they grow out themself, you should straighten them. that's probably your best bet. because if you used chemicals and what not, you could end up like growing hair on your forehead. my grandpa did that. (: haha oops.|`|dY8sNKChaa	brush them a lot right before you go to sleep and right when you wake up.  if they're that bad, then you can always pin them back until they grow.  and it's only 2 weeks until a bad haircut gets better!
HhmhSBpgaa	unless you have natural curl good luck with out a triple barrel waver. you ca n do this technique with a iron but it is time consuming and very hard to do on yourself.|`|mKDSnQO5aa	Use sunsilk waves of envy spray!

TPQ3Sz7iaa	FIDM is that fashion school in downtown LA right? So i can see why you're worrying about your outfit. Wear something that you think will represent the kind of clothes you're looking to design (if you're headed that way). Or if you've already made some garments yourself, wear those; hopefully she'll like them and ask where you got them, and you can be all "Oh this? Well, i made it myself actually.."  I actually think this is a cute and practical look, it's really in at my HS right now:  http://elizabethlaney.files.wordpress.co...  just with a lower waisted, more "bubble"y skirt.     or something like this  http://i166.photobucket.com/albums/u108/...  with a tank top tucked in and simple flats; you could cover the high waist with a wide belt, and either wear tights or have bare legs.     goodluck! :)|`|3OeE8kMQaa	Fashion forward, but try to be age/situation appropriate (ie: not overly made-up, not to much cleavage, short skirts, stilettos, ect).

Y27ovMdRaa	Wash your face and put some toothpaste on them (preferably gel).  Trust me . . . sounds nuts but it works.|`|jBc3PaGLaa	try clean and clear products, NOT proactive, it doesnt work. even toothpaste will make the redness go down, to make it less noticable. just put original NON WHITENING toothpaste on them and leave it for an hour or so, and then rinse it off completely so it wont dry out your skin.|`|AA11428459	like ew, good luck with that|`|JPpDWrDUaa	Here are some facial masks that REALLY work well.     1. Smash 1 banana in a bowl and make sure you get rid of the clumps. Add only A BIT of milk so it's easy to pat on your face. Spread on your face(yes with your hands) and wait for 15-30 mins. Makes a great moisturizer. I try to do it once a week.    2. Crack a egg in the bowl and separate the yolk from the white. Mix the white a bit and then spread it over your face (with hands) and wait till it hardens. Then mix the yolk and PAT it on your face. Wait till it hardens and then wash it off. I suggest doing this before you take a shower so you get it all off well.    Sounds crazy but it really works. Tooth paste sorta works but once I either put on too much or I just put it on there for too long and it like burned my face. (not literally but it felt like it)|`|yEohiFtiaa	clearasil daily wash works pretty well.......witch hazel and tea tree oil are good for cleaning the area and drying them out.....i've heard about the tooth paste idea but b careful if u have sensitive skin as it can burn a little.  u  can also buy masks that can help 2....peals etc|`|YwHl37Hgaa	You can try this crush 1to 2 Aspirin tablets mix with a little water and apply on pimples for 15 minutes and wash.

EytUZvyiaa	Use a little bit of concealer and moisturize your face with tinted moisturizer. Believe me, it helps! It will seem more noticeable to you than anyone else, though, so don't get paranoid, and ask for outside help.|`|hpX4up0maa	TECHNIQUES to CAMOUFLAGE UNDER EYE BAGS and PUFFINESS     To diminish a puffy or fatty deposit of the under eye area, choose a darker color tone (one or two shades) of your foundation and apply directly on the puff. Underneath the puff or bag, is a dark line. Fill in the area with a lighter color. The Everything Pencil is perfect for this task, or take a small brush with crme concealer. Do this over your foundation, then powder lightly to rid of any shine. You are creating an illusion which diminishes the look of the puff of the bag, making it look like a flatter area. Take the Everything Pencil everywhere you go and touch up during the day.     If you have light discoloration under your eyes, the pencil may be all you need. It also gets into fine lines and is perfect for the inner corner eye, where it is always darker. It is opaque enough to cover up very dark circles, buy creamy enough for the under eye area and it will stay put all day. Dont forget to neutralize your eyelids as well, for they can be full of spider veins that come through on this delicate skin area.|`|pzwz6f9uaa	put a metal spoon in the freezer and appy it to your eye for about 2 to 4 minutes however bad the damage is  do this til it goes away.    its better than makeup seriously

A056SKTxaa	no dont listen to that girl...i had my monroe done last yr and it got infected so i took it out and i just recently got it pierced again....everyone told me different things to clean it with. but the only thing you should use is sea salt...i rinse with sea salt twice a day and take a q-tip and go around the outside of the piercing and then the inside around around the flat bak...do not use anything with alcohal or soap or neosporin or any of that it prolongs the healing process..if i were you id just stick to sea salt...and when/if you smoke and eat rinse with NON alcohal mouth wash.|`|TT6Nk0JNaa	If it oozes pus it is infected, and the infection is stopping it from healing totally. Try disinfecting it regularly with hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol.  Take out whatever you wear in the hole and put disinfectant on it before putting it back in.

eXbicqqZaa	I use both wash out and keep in conditioners too, and it used to look really greasy, but i needed the smooth hair because it tangles easily   I got the idea to do the following and it has helped a lot and my hair is still silky smooth!    You want to shampoo ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS before you put in wash out conditioner. After i shampoo, i put a quarter size dollop of conditioner in the palm of my hand and work it in from root to tip I let it sit for a minute or two and wash it out. Then i put a dime sized amount of shampoo back in my hair after i conditioned it so  that gets rid of any un-wanted greasiness. Then when i get out of the shower i towel dry my hair and brush through it. Here is where the leave in conditioner comes in-- After i brush through my hair, i put another small dime sized amount in the palm of my hand, and distribute the leave in conditioner through my hair, and brush it again.      This is a great system for me, and i think it might work for you! There is no harm in trying it, and if you decide that you don't want the leave in-- don't use it.|`|Mula85EKaa	If you have color or bleach on your hair it wont hurt. But it could make it look oily  if you use to much . So try using it every other time you shampoo your hair and see how it goes. But if you are trying to get rid of the frizzy's then you might  try  using a smoothing cream on your hair . It will help it .
lU8e0VQFaa	Actually, my BC (Seasonale) did make mine bigger, about 3/4 a cup size but two others I was on did nothing. But just because mine got bigger doesn't mean your's will. I haven't had one that helped with my skin. Bigger boobs was a nice unexpected surprise (once I got over the shock) but I really got it because it's only one period for every 3 months.     Just take it as your Dr tells you, and make sure he knows your full history and don't smoke, and you should be good to go.|`|AA12032374	ask your doctor|`|6OldQQCOaa	Abstinence.|`|hlXxuOOTaa	yaz!|`|6wxgyGy5aa	Well with the pill, generally ppl don't gain much weight (max 10lbs) but I have never heard of breasts growing due to any BC option.  I wouldn't recommend the IUD for anyone who hasn't had children yet (there is a risk of scarring).  Also with the Depo shot it can take up to a year before your cycle goes back to normal.  A friend of mine had fertility issues that her doc blamed on years of Depo use.

I don't think there is such a pill. It would put breast inplants out of business, not to mention oxy 10.|`|sB2MvRR5aa	Okay, first of all nothing can make ur boobs bigger. That's a myth. Second of all... you have to take a lot of care when choosing a brand. Go see a doctor. If you get a random kind then it can really screw up your periods, moods AND weight. You can get depression and stuff if you get the wrong kind. Be very careful. I am on it and it took a few diffrent brands to stablize me. The doctor will tell you what kind you need based on your personality and body. Plus you need a percription anyway... you need to get that from your doctor:)
nBhUQRDAaa	When I got mine done, it didnt hurt at all...a lot of my friends say that it hurt them when they clamped it but not when they pierced it.     Mine only hurt because it was tender afterwards. . . which is to be expected, but the procedure did not hurt at all. Just dont look at the needle until after they pierce it... :)    she made me eat til i was full before she would pierce it too-that stretched my skin so that if i got bloated after the piercing i wouldnt reject the piercing. I think it also helped with the pain...    its a fun piercing if you take care of it!  good luck!|`|S8YGWHJlaa	it hurts badd!!!!! i would never do it again! ewwww...|`|8O4ttgGMaa	not horrible. and who cares? if you want it, you're going to have to deal with the pain.|`|2qgIXb7Zaa	If you're looking for a painless operation, don't do it in the first place! That's like purposefully shooting yourself in the stomach.|`|8uUpAKPtaa	It's not that bad, it feels like a bad bee sting. It only hurts for a moment, it goes by quick.

HhmhSBpgaa	asian hair is very glassy it is harder to lift if you try lightening your hair at home use a loreal or clairol color they are easier to correct and keep the box just in case. I would select the haircolor you like and go 1 to 2 shades lighter. because you can always go darker but you can't go lighter without bleaching it because color wont lift color.|`|cXRRP6ttaa	haha, i smiled when i read ur question.  i'm asian too and i dyed my hair about 2 months ago. it was first time i did it in long time. i used to see a colorist regularly but figure since they can't get it right.    what i did was i left on my color solution for 2 hours!!!! i told my hairstylist and he thought that was too much, do not exceed 30 minutes.  i picked a medium copper brown color. the reason i did that was b/c i remember when i was younger, it'd never work if i just left it for 30 min. and picking light brown would not look good either.   i just wanted a subtle change and it worked.    u may have to do it in 2 tries. i bought l'oreal paris brand and u can go to the site for profile on what would work best on ur hair. it was pretty good and useful.     always remember, if u leave it on more than 30 min, ur scalp gives off  heat so if may be brighter on top then the rest. but don't exceed 1 hour. (even tho i got away w/it)    also, since ur going from black to auburn, remember to do conditioning treatment few days ahead of time to prepare ur hair for the treatment.  Good Luck!!|`|dkGnUPM9aa	Plz don't dye your hair alot of boys like asian girls because of their hair it's so awesome!    my advice is keep your hair because the black hair looks good on them  if you do dye your hair try to get it in a brownish black color my asian friend did that and she looks good with it.|`|z2zZCJDRaa	I wouldn't go to Wal*Mart. I don't really have any experience with  Asian hair, but I would go to a salon just to be safe.

cc907ba0da91b4e628fce923bcff1c26aa	Warmest greetings - XoxoX!    1st off, beauty is 95% uniqueness & 5% perfection. Sometimes what we considered to be flaws in our facial features, in fact, are the very things that gives our face its unique character and thus its individual beauty. You seemed concerned that your nose is not appealing and hid it in the picture. Yet when I see the rest of your face I see great interesting features, i.e. - beautifully set and shaped bright alluring eyes, smooth satin skin, fresh shin tone, high cheekbones, sleek & sensual jawline & shimmering gorgeous hair.     My fiancee is a working model and gets selected for jobs on a regular basis because her nose is interesting - it has a bump.  She is so glad that she did not have it "fixed" as it would have made her have just another beautiful, yet ordinary face. Now she scoops up all off the jobs for exotic looking women and makes 6 figures a year. Love your face, be confident in your own skin, do not try to attain perfection as viewed by other, instead aspire to be the best you & your are stunningly pretty - k? Nuff said on that subject.    That said, there are obviously hundreds of formulas and types of foundations/primers on the market. The biggest difference is consistency.    Powder foundation is a smooth, dry formula that is common for oily skin types. The powder helps absorb oil and keeps your face looking smooth and fresh. Dry skin types usually don't like the powder because it tends to have a drying effect and leaves flakes.    Cream foundation has a thick consistency, which is common for dry skin types. It provides moisture and adds luster to dry, tired skin. This type of foundation is often used by middle-aged and older women who like something to "fill-in" the lines. Cream foundation tends to be heavier and provide more coverage. It's best to use a moisturizer first before applying foundation.    Stick foundation is similar to the cream foundation as far as texture. The "stick" design provides a convenient way to transport your make up without an awkward bottle. This formula is often used for touch up jobs and spot treatments.    Liquid foundation is used for all skin types. It is a "universal" formula. You can purchase liquid foundations that are oil-free or non-clogging. This type of foundation is versatile and can come in different coverage levels.    If you know your skin type and know the coverage level you are most comfortable with then you can decide the formula of foundation that will best fit your individual needs. Remember you need a good canvas to start with so use your three step skin care regime (cleanse, tone, moisturize) before applying foundation.    Foundation/primer is made to accentuate your features. It should look natural and match your skin. In order to find a "perfect match" for your foundation you must test it on your face. Testing it on your wrist is a no, no because your wrist is a different color than your face. Other parts of your body may tan easier or be exposed to the sun more often than your face. Try a few swipes down the chin to the neck and the color that you can't see is the one you should be using.    Test the foundation on your cheek or chin. If the foundation appears to disappear into the skin when your stripe it with a Q-tip in the test area and there is no discoloration then you probably have a pretty good match. Make sure the lighting in the store is close to natural light. Ask for several opinions and test a couple of color shades so you can compare.     - Maximilian|`|FyJ8Jc9Saa	I have also had a problem finding a good foundation. Lately I have been using mineral powder, and it works really well. You could try Bare Minerals, but it is pretty expensive. Avon also carries mineral foundation, that is what I use. They even have it now at Wal-Mart, although I can't remember what brands have it. Maybelline is coming to mind. Just go look and see what color you think would work best. Some even have a chart that you can hold up to your skin to see what color you need.     The mineral powder works really well and hides a lot of imperfections on your skin. I also use concealer on zits and stuff before I put it on which also helps. I've also heard that mineral foundation is good for your skin.    Good Luck!|`|GR2XNzCCaa	Mineral Make up, try not to use pressed powders if you aim for natural. I also like Cover Girl. Great place to start looking for make up is Walgreens or Sephora.|`|kogfFMgmaa	why would u ask a boy for make up help?    um buy makeup that u like that ur friends recommend u buy maybe  or just go to the makeup store and ask anyone who works there wat type of foundation u should buy|`|wdvUNvz6aa	go to a dept store like macys and sit at one of the little chair things and tell them wht you told us and they will assist you however some of their prices are a bit steep so copy what they do for you just go to a CVS or something.|`|BVStC6Sjaa	i would buy mineral foundation it blends nicely into the skin just make sure you find the right one that matches your skin color|`|0qNuPw5taa	http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...  this is great i use it all the time. and you shouldn't feel ashamed by the way you look :)
QBV4cFbqaa	I have the same problem but in a different way. I don't look like I'm hispanic. I always get confused for a mixed race. Before i would feel self concience because i wanted to look like the girls from my background. But i've learned to deal with it. I flaunt my unique look. Just be confident in what you are and have. Trust me once you feel REALLY confident in your look people will be like "who is she?" "i want to get to know her". Embrace your look. BE CONFIDENT.!!!! Good luck!|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Are you female?  If you are, maybe you should try dressing in something which highlights your attributes.  But don't go too trampy.  That can be counter-productive.

6YwLlYovaa	the shades I find help enhance brown eyes are green, purple (or lilac if you aren't into bright colours,) pink, certain browns, and gold. as you have tanned skin I think that the gold would look lovely on you, and give you a sort of goddess type look. I think gold and green are your best bets.  play around with the colours and find what works for you, and what you like.   if you want some step by step instructions on how to bring out your eyes have a look on  youtube for make-up tutorials for brown eyes.  hope this helps you!|`|Y4s4Om38aa	Seriously, the Almay "play up the brown" Really does make brown eyes pop....especially the eyeshadow.

msVN7GBpaa	watch the makeup tutorials and they will show you how to apply on youtube|`|jjIcSMCvaa	Try looking a whole bunch of different color eye shadows.  Decide which ones you like.  Then look around for samples so you can see which ones look best on you. Then do the same with blush, mascara, lip gloss, lipstick, foundation, concealer, etc. Then buy them!  While you are at the store ask the employee on duty to give you tips.  Make sure you buy only what you need, like if you have clear skin you don't need foundation and concealer, if you have a naturally rosy cheeks skip the blush.  If you get at least four different eyeshadow and lipstick colors you can mix and match every day!

qut2FcpEaa	My situation is similar to yours: my science fair is this weekend and I planned on going out with friends after it. Science Fair has always been more "business" like, most girls would wear some form of dress slacks or business type skirt with a blouse or blazer. However, you can pretty much wear anything as long as it isn't too flashy, shows too much, trashy, or is provocative. You can wear leggings with a nice tunic or sweater dress with ballet flats (maybe high heels). If all else fails just wear a nice pair of dark jeans with a pretty top and flats/boots/or heels. I planned on wearing leggings with a tunic and black high heels. That way I am still dressed up but I can still go out, make it smart casual. For makeup just with something light, pretty eye shadow with mascara, a nice blush and lip gloss should do good.

OHfZFR31aa	Most of those are nothing but scams, or the search might be legit but they attract scam agencies    Real agencies don't send people to hotel open calls - they don't need to They have thousands of people a week sending pictures to them, as well as scouts travelling around the world looking for new talent    You are better off sending in your pictures directly to agencies like Ford, IMG, Wilhelmina, Elite, DNA, Women, Click, Next, etc and they will contact you if you have the right look - and you won't have to pay anything except transportation to their office|`|1IIY1Ds6aa	idk sorry|`|C3mz7fpMaa	Any company that advertises in the newspaper is not a legitimate agency.

SG27rfSdaa	Ok, not everyone can use a general acne med like Neutrogena....we all have different skin and some have sensitive skin or dry skin(like me) I would suggest you see a dermatologist- a doctor who specializes in skin who may prescribe a nice acne med for you. I have one that works GREAT! Just ask your regular doctor to see a dermatologist.  Also, cream on your face can make the acne worse! So it appears you're just using too many things and you might have to stop the makeup temporarily.  If you really need makeup, then get treated by the skin doctor, stop using cream on your face. That will clear up the acne and you won't need makeup. (or you can use the makeup occassionally.)|`|6wxgyGy5aa	If your skin is dry then that would do it.  Otherwise due to your sensitivity it may be a reaction to one of your products|`|yngXCPjEaa	It's probably just really dry.|`|LLhLEIUAaa	hmmm maybe preservatives in the skincare you are using making your skin itchy?

QBV4cFbqaa	I'm obviously not a guy, but i got my brother(17 years old) cologne for christmas. He really wanted "unforgivable" from sean john. It smells very pleasent. It's soft but at the same time sweet but in a guy way. It makes a statement. It smells really good ! Another one that smells freaking good from a girls perspective is chrome. You can get these at macys. Remember to try them on first and leave them on for 15 min while shopping. Your body's chemistry will alter the smell in the cologne. If it's a match it will smell good on you and if it isn't it will not be pleasent. SO just try some on and see which one suits you best. Good luck.|`|dzi87Ygoaa	Aqua Di Geo  is awsome its one of my favorites. Jay Z has a cologne out and it smells good. Polo is good, and American Eagle has a cologne also.

Is there anyway you could put a small band-aid over the earring?  Or, see if your piercer has translucent (clear) earrings that they could put in for you.  If you take the earring out and leave it out for any length of time, generally just a few hours, it will close and you will have to jam the earring back through the hole to open it again.  Not a pleasant thing to do.|`|SG27rfSdaa	If you just got your ear or nose pieced a WEEK ago, it will close up if you take it out.|`|Y27ovMdRaa	:-(  It will close.

aQT37RaKaa	I have oily+dandruff hair too. Head&Shoulders Citrus Breeze works like a charm! If it doesn't work go with shampoo's with citrus fruits. Use H&S conditioner too.|`|26lZZaWNaa	for oily hair and dandruff part your hair stratch the dandruff out and shake  baby powder on your hair. Then wash your hair with nixxon shampoo and use the conditioner. Baby powder absorbs the oil in the hair and nixxon products are good for dandruff. Trust me, it sounds crazy but it works. I go to the Dominican Salon every two weeks and they do this to women who hair is down there back, not to mention my hair has not been oily or had any dandruff. On weeks I can't afford the salon, I do it myself.|`|a55c811df92734d3da6ba231bf1219e6aa	try shampooing everyday in the morning. and don't touch your hair a lot, b/c the oils from your hands.

Also, try going to a salon and buying a salon quality dandruff shampoo, they really work.|`|RGGcWvawaa	To treat oily hair, you must change your diet. I'm not talking about drastic changes, just simple ones that will help your hair from oiling up.    Instead of eating cheese, butter, milk, and cream, switch to low-fat cottage cheese and skimmed milk.    Substitute fatty meats like pork and lamb with grilled lean steak.  Avoid fried foods, sausages, bacon, salami, smoked salmon, sardines, or any food served or prepared with oil, mayonnaise, salad dressing, nuts, and pickles.    You're probably wondering what's left to eat? Well you could try eating vegetables and lean meat. You can add spices to flavor it up. Just because you're eating healthy doesn't mean it won't be delicious. And remember, if you can't change your diet, then simply lessen the quantity of the above mentioned foods. Trust me, it WILL make a difference!
6YwLlYovaa	try using an eye primer like urban decay primer potion, or too faced shadow insurance first. a primer will help to improve the staying power of your make-up.  have you tried using gel liner instead of pencil or liquid? lately I've been using MAC fluidline and applying it with an angled brush. it sounds a little complicated, but it's really easy to apply, and get an even application. I find that gel liners tend to run less, and with gel liner you can get a really thick line easily.  coastal scents have great quality gel liners too if you're not loving MAC's prices, and loreal sells hip cream liners that you can find in most drugstores.  if you still find your liner's running you could try using eyeshadow over your liner to set it. any shadow that's the same colour of your liner will work. this will also help to soften the edges of your liner, giving it a smokey look.  hope this helps!|`|GR2XNzCCaa	Keep applying thin layers and letting them dry inbetween so that if you touch it none will be on your finger. Also, if you mean like when you cry, waterproof is great. But my suggestion is little to no eyeliner at all.

mS1fej9Jaa	The swelling goes down in a day or two. After a month or so, you can switch out the bar to a shorter one so it is more comfortable. After a few months, you'll be so used to it you'll forget you have it on. After a year it is fully healed and you can take it out for a couple days straight, even a week or two (depending on how quickly your body heals).    If you get an infection, go back to the piercer and ask them to check out. They'll have experience with that kind of thing. Infection really isn't that common though, I know a lot of people who have had it done (including myself). If it is serious, as with any medical problem, you should see your doctor.    I really recommend you do research online before you get it done. By knowing what to expect, most of the nerves should go away by the time you get it. If you have any other questions, ask the piercer...you are paying for a service, so you have the right to ask as many quesitons as you want.    Remember, it looks scary but its really just a pinch and then its over (in a heartbeat).     Oh and don't listen to the critics who say things like tongue rings are "trashy". What makes someone "trashy" is how you carry yourself, not a little metal bar. It is your body, do what makes you happy. Best of luck..|`|fna0OfuCaa	The piercing itself doesn't really hurt that bad, but afterward its swollen and very sore for about 4 or 5 days...I couldn't eat anything at all until 5 days after.

eNWnJ2ynaa	hey! i live in ny and i did the whole sweet sixteen deal last year. lots of parties.     if it's at a club/dance floor: wear a short dress (actually, almost everyone buys a dress from forever21 or h&m)     ex. http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...    for dresses, the rule of thumb is to keep it short and simple. nothing too flashy since you're not the birthday girl. color is fine but stay away ffrom any dresses that look too prom like.    another choice would be a silky backless top and long black leggings.    i would stick to those. you can wear a top and a skirt. but most ppl just wear what i wrote above.     if you can, wear heels. that's the best way to dress up an outfit.     have fun!    oh and i know a lot of ppl posted really shiny satiny dresses, try to stay away from those. most ppl don't wear the shiny stuff to parties. at least if they're just dance parties. chiffon is a nice choice.|`|tnoyKjJ1aa	forever 21 or h&m.. since the party is in ny youre gonna want something a bit flashy..    http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...    http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...    http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...    http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...    http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...    http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...|`|S8YGWHJlaa	this one?:  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...  i love this one:)  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...|`|8d4e98eb46a89703c3297f2564c2c323aa	I recommend Forever 21, Wetseal, or Charlotte Russe.

85c7b5c821a7ba39949a3307cf876e59aa	i think his best bet is to straighten it and get side bangs =] it'll look emolicious|`|J8gcsIjnaa	i dont think emo hair would look good on a black person. tell him to get an afro. yeah afros pwn|`|9H86ri12aa	uhh|`|SKcRZ1bnaa	he could try a mohawk or he can relax his hair or something|`|kogfFMgmaa	um........ ok.. wats a fade? and why does it matter that hes black? everyone has different types of hair just cuz hes black doesnt mean anything.     what u do is   u go to the hair dresser and ask for side bangs.|`|26lZZaWNaa	what is emo hair?|`|PmItBOPoaa	Do painful things to him self maybe.not sure|`|y7OLG5rIaa	well if his black hair is the pubic hair type, hes gonna have to grow it out super long, and get it chemically straightend.  otherwise, you could just blowdry his hair with a round brush to get it good and straight, then use a straightening iron in SMALL sections so it actually works, and hairspray it so it stays.  good luck!|`|btNoRiPWaa	there is no natural way, I believe he'd have to make it straight.

A bit of a tan would make your newly toned legs look much better.  Don't get me wrong, toning is great and they look good, but there was nothing wrong with your legs in the first place.     I hope I helped.|`|ncPdftafaa	girl you thick!! that's hot! you got some booty :D|`|IHa6FxE6aa	You have beautiful legs, sweetheart. :)|`|e68a6a673385cf8ff6673cecb42f930aaa	Your legs are fine, you have nothing to worry about.|`|d1d43c8be7b4dd12bd1e7e90583bbe5eaa	a little hard to tell as the "before" shot has your legs covered and the "now" shots has them naked (couldn't help but use the term naked in there ...lol) ... bottom line (and I really wasn't looking at your bottom line) your legs are fine ... you have them just the way i like them ... one on each side :-)|`|xdyM3IVmaa	They're okay.

ToeeUGZUaa	I would definitley say on the inside of your wrist. And for the price, pretty much it just depends on the size. Small= 50$  Meadium= 75$  Large= 100|`|LBHJaqXoaa	$50 for a small star, and I would definitely get it on your wrist instead of your hand. I have seen hand tattoos age and they don't age well.|`|AARZV2v0aa	prob 40-50 depends who does it and where you live, if you want color...ect. I think that any tattoo with meaning is always the best choice. Maybe a favorite flower wrapping around the wrist, or a favorite saying(quote).  that would cost a little more maybe.
PoQpInCBaa	ask them about neon zebra.  i love the variety of designs and colors they have.|`|7XU0Cx9vaa	I like bright reds. Depends on your skin color though. Im tan so red and deep colors look good

JZEVU1aqaa	i wore yellow jeans last week! i wore a shirt that was a lot of diff colors, but along the bust it was the same color as the jeans fading into purple. it worked well! i suggest wearing a shirt that has accents that are the same color as the pants.|`|OoihsiN0aa	Black, gray, red, hmm not much else lol|`|hkzGYQD4aa	I would wear a white shirt. I think a white cotton v-neck would look good on a girl. For a guy, I think just a plain white cotton t-shirt would look nice.     =]|`|TYRRjIv4aa	white or a gray would work with the yellow pants|`|938df05f7e46c8b204de6d111a903edcaa	gray  blue  green  pink  white  maybe orange|`|8O4ttgGMaa	http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1271144 6dzz5z5...|`|J9C90TIbaa	ummmm.....white,dark dark blue,if u r kinda wild then maybe red....it depends on what kind of yellow pants.....good luck|`|jaukRNb1aa	http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1254059 6dzz5z5...|`|pOKdvur0aa	Well, black,... lol.

D:   Anyway,   White, blue, orange.|`|DAqKrFLLaa	I wear all kinds of weird colors together.  I think blue, red and green look good with yellow depending on the shade of yellow.  I like pink and brown with it too.  Also black and white.
UB7pWWHeaa	they sell these little hair removal razor things that are motor controlled for things like that at convenience stores. i use one because i have sensitive skin also. after using it my lip will be a little red for the rest of the night but it goes away by morning.|`|Kb0p6mcJaa	threading.  it hurts, buhh its correct & lasts longerr.
QsR4VzCSaa	i have pretty big boobs so i dont have that problem but for extra cleavage i use this trick, adjust the bra straps as tight as they can go so it pulls your boobs up and then i take a string or shoelace or whatever and tie the straps together in the back so the back straps look like an X in the back and i tie it as tight as possible and it gives great lift and cleavage and also hides your bra straps if your wearing a tank or cute sleeveless top, try it it will definately help!|`|2wZcWe98aa	try and get a smaller bra, ones that snap in the front too. They alway push them together :]|`|8uUpAKPtaa	You are obviously wearing the wrong size bra if a push up and cutlets don't do anything for you. You must be a size A. That's the only thing I can think of....just get some implants..

When your pregnant your boobs increase in size pretty dramatically and once your done being pregnant they stay bigger, but may shrink back a bit. I know what you mean. I'm almost a full B, but my mom is a Full C and my grandmother is like a D or beyond lol. My mom is small and only about 5'3 while i stand about your height. She had the same size boobs as me when she was young and shes also naturally thin. Since i'm taller the thinness has become more noticeable, but i also have a great set if legs and butt thank to my thinness. The negative is the lack of boobage. Don't worry about it! Honestly! Most guys admire a girl with a nice behind rather then a girl with some boobs. It's all about the butt & trust me on that. Majority of guys don't really care about boobs. Their usually fine with a hand full. I've noticed like 8[-9 out of my 10 high school boyfriends always checked out a girl's butt instead of a girl's breasts. All the fat ones usually had big boobs. Honestly it's so much better to have a tight stomach, nice long legs, and a nice big or nicely shaped but over a fat chick with a set of DD's. Be confident and keep in mind that when your older they'll naturally in flat lol. For now wear padded and push up bras to compliment what you have and give it the illusion that their a bit larger then they actually are. Enjoy your thinness!  I Know i do!|`|sdYoRJnUaa	get plastic surgery|`|9FrBtCfDaa	accept your body the way it is    and eat chocolate because it's delicious|`|DHNFkSLcaa	How old ru. gain 5 pounds and do upper body workouts.
IAStQqOHaa	They turn it on for you at the front desk. Dont wear oil if you have never tanned before. Wear lotion that has bronzer in it. It comes in a black bottle at walmart. Put the lotion everywhere except for your face. Do not wear makeup, it will keep you from tanning as well. You can go naked, but I wear either a bikini or my bra and undies. You can buy the eye goggles anywhere. They probably have to goggles at the salon too. They clean the bed for you.    Some other things to know:  -Cover your face with a towel while tanning  -Put your hair in a ponytail  -always wear eyewear  -Use the "Diva Bed" if available. It cuts tanning time from 30-40 minutes to around 8  -If it is your first time tanning, tan for only about 6 minutes (in Diva Bed"  -OutBack tanning is the best!    Anything else?-- Just email me! :)
Lkc6fqF9aa	oh yeah!  i'm using that one rite now.  you can go to walmart and buy it.  uhmm..  i dunno if they still sell it  but i got mine like just a month ago.  and i went there and bought it..  hope i helped.

LuTjBw4Laa	trimming helps every few weeks and don't over heat your hair! Moisturize it and keep it healthy. I suggest head and shoulders it does good stuff to your hair. And im trying to grow my hair long too don't worry you are not the only one with this problem. Hope that helps! (:|`|lK6FzBAuaa	you do nothing to it until it's the length you desire, (every six months get a trim (dead ends?)) (: good luck!|`|WWNy0Tc2aa	just let it grow out. trimming your hair ALOT helps. like every 5 weeks because split ends and stuff that damage your hair go from the tips to your roots and damages it making it harder to grow|`|jv0BDTNMaa	You let it grow....|`|3dzuYTC5aa	You need to get a minor trim every 6 months.... were as regular cuts to keep the length are about every 3 months.   The roots draw the vitamins from the bottoms of your hair why the bottoms need trimming to look nicer but also helps your hair grow.|`|HhmhSBpgaa	give it a light trim every 10 to 12 weeks and use good sampoo and conditioner.|`|YAozHqSYaa	You can't just use a product in your hair and expect it to grow by 1 day. LOL  any way it takes time to grow. make sure you cut your split ends. I have short hair too. i my end like every 3 weeks. my hair even got stronger. i'm not sure i heard that dr.miracle is real good. but i dont use those stuff. hope this helped
wPucIiwjaa	You could try using a less intense shampoo, something organic maybe because it sounds like your scalp is really dry. Try shampooing your hair as soon as you get in the shower (only the top, not the ends), then put a good conditioner in your hair and if it's long enough but it in a bun.  Finish showering while the conditioner sits in your hair then rinse before you get out.  then try a good leave in conditioner when you get out of the shower when our hair is still really wet.  deep condition at least once a week. I do this and my hair is angel soft, even though I bleach it often. And the less heat you use on your hair the better (i.e. blow dryers and straighteners)|`|TSq9054Haa	use head and shoulders. while your hair is still wet get one of the defrizzers that you can put in your hair. but make sure its the kind to put in your hair while its still wet! make sure you only use about a quarter size so your hair doesn't look greasy! then dry your hair with a hair dryer but use a flat brush and dry it piece by piece by pointing the hair dryer down from root to tip with the flat brush behind it! it sounds simple but i tried it on my friend who has hopelessly frizzy hair and it made hers look awesome. also when you style it buy a defrizzer that you put on dry hair only! only use a pea sized amount and that should take care of it! hope this helps!|`|H1NjIT10aa	First for the dandruff.  Don't use just one product all the time.  Rotate.  Selson Blue for a week.  Head and Shoulders for a week.  Nizoral for a week.  (btw, Nizoral is a great product and use to be a prescription only medication.)  Then start over with the Selson Blue.  This was the recommendation of my dermatologist and works fairly well.      Frizzy hair.    You could try a relaxer to try to get the frizzies out.  Or try an anti frizzy product that is suppose to help with that.  That is if your hair isn't over processed.    A flat iron might help too again if your hair is not over processed.|`|vsrMraWJaa	o my god o my god ur hair like i care lol jk...    iron it     xD|`|XSbFL5uAaa	Use less shampoo and shampoo on your scalp. Use more conditioner, focus on the ends. Rinse hair in cool water. Try a deep conditioner treatment once a week.|`|xglOR1bXaa	shave it off..|`|9BiMgggIaa	you should straighten it or you can take a shower and put a lot of gel in it to keep it under control. Or you can go for the messy look. Put it in a messy bun with a perty head band.|`|lK6FzBAuaa	...bed head products work wonders...(:
2Q5HI0Qmaa	both are couture depending on which line you want from each brand. their cheaper lines are michael by michael kors and marc by marc jacobs, which are generally hundreds of dollars. their couture lines are just michael kors and marc jacobs, which range in the thousands.    i'm not sure which lines you're talking about, but personally, i've always thought that marc jacobs was the better brand out of the two. marc jacobs, i've always thought was better crafted and more thought out than michael kors. i mean, marc jacobs charges just as much for their nylon satchels as michael kors charges for their leather satchels. the materials are way different, but i've always preferred marc jacobs for their better craftsmanship (i think) and their superior materials since their nylon is really high quality.     go with the marc jacobs! hope this helps.|`|wdmp9eYXaa	definitely Michael Kors is the best hands down.|`|ad44loBcaa	i like marc jacobs better|`|56eAArieaa	they are extremely different both r fab  michael kors are more wearable in everyday life and more affordable marc is couture and high style harder to wear in everday places outside ny but so very cute
bH37fDw4aa	some of it is old and weird but some of it is really good! alot of people donate clothes that they got as gifts and don't fit into or something, so it's basically like buying new stuff! and Plato's doesn't usually buy things from people that are gross and out of style, so i think that sounds like a good deal!|`|2FVwbIe5aa	it's worth a shot.  i've goten some really cute stuff there, like it's not all old crappy clothes. the one by me only takes good stuff.  it's basically like buying it new!|`|RIbhvrBTaa	eww...thrift store...|`|QcX4fugiaa	they have some great stuff. and it's not like goodwill clothing. everything's name brand. hollister, forever21, aeropostale, etc. lol i just went in their for my first time today to get a shirt. i got and express shirt (oxford) for 13 and that one was on the pricy side. and you also get a card so that each time you shop their you get a punch and then once it's filled you get 20% off everything in the store. and the lady gave me 2 punches cuz i didn't use a bag :)|`|1Fpn5wHAaa	you can find some good stuff there, but be picky, HAVE A LOT OF TIME, and look at the shorts lol.|`|xJwPKtX9aa	it's pretty good, but the stuff can be kinda worn out. they have good brands and whole sections of abercrombie and hollister.
fDElc7Qhaa	The Vans Store|`|fMPyLqW4aa	Try Journeys or ebay|`|AA11560862	Journey's|`|bOBa4XkKaa	It is A shoestore Called Journeys. It is awesome! :) That is where I buy almost all of my shoes.

NqMBrbfHaa	Powder::::: is used to set foundation..or control shine..or just some slight coverage.    Powder Foundation:::for more coverage..on top of your foundation...depending on your skin problems..you might not need foundation.    Concealer:::used to cover blemishes that over red and noticeable,can also be used to cover dark circles{ not applied all over skin]    Foundation::used all over face...used if you need or what a lot of coverage.|`|P667pOpgaa	well lets see if i can help you AT ALL! I am not sure about half of these.  well I am not sure of the difference between the powder and powder foundation...BUT i do know that concealer is what you put on to CONCEAL the zits, pimples or redness! It is put on before you do foundation. the foundation is put on over top of the concealer. It just gives it a nice look.   Some people do foundation and than put the concealer on...I do it the other way but oh well....maybe I am just unique. who knows?   well I hope I helped!|`|p1EGAXfiaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out several products.I would check out the review site at http://www.brandsmakeup.com visit and see what everyone recommends.

At least some form of effort put into appearances is important)|`|9VqUC9Haaa	I like the longer hair.... looks nice! or spiked... either way..|`|hPRPO3qgaa	buzz cut or hair that spiked a little bit, but not too much.|`|BY6OSDSeaa	i like sort of long hair thats almost in your eyes with a sort of messy sort of neat look|`|YAozHqSYaa	Guys are really into spiky hair now. I have no idea why. But it's not that bad.|`|2so60OEZaa	it says joe but i'm on my friends username..  i like short hair bc its clean cut and looks nice but it depends what your personality and face structure is i guess.   some guys look good w/ medium to long length but i would never go longer than the bottom of your ear lobes. and if its long then trim it sometimes bc it can get messy and look bad.|`|sLkMlt8kaa	'Emo' hair.   You know, long with bangs sweeping over one or both eyes,  That is the hottest thing in the world|`|K8QTdUnfaa	Clean and cared for.

W9kgitPQaa	clothes: wear what you would normally wear to school, but maybe one thing different. like instead of denim skinny jeans, you could wear a brightly colored pair. or instead of a plain shirt, you could wear a slightly dressier one. a look i like is jeans, a plain tee, a funky scarf, and plain flats. it's chic and laid back all at once.    makeup: natural! guys love a natural looking girl. don't overdo it. concealer, powder, mascara, a little eyeliner, some eyeshadow in a neutral color, and some chapstick (looks more laid back then lipgloss).     jewelry: if your outfit is loud, then keep jewelry to a minimum. but if it's more plain, you could wear some chunky jewerly, or some pearls, or whatever is your style.     GOOD LUCK! ?|`|I6pmPb1Baa	skinny jeans, ballet flats, v-neck shirt, straighten hair.|`|F5rI81Hbaa	Well depending in the weather where you live, I think you should wear a cute flirty dress. A dress will accentuate your legs, and make your chest appear cute. Just wear natural make-up. Less is more. Do a cute up-do with your hair so you're not worrying about it the whole date. Wear simple jewelry; cute earings and a necklace. Ballet flats.|`|98v2W0gGaa	don't wear anything.|`|I3g6rlQBaa	Just wear something you would normally wear to school.. don't get dressed up or anything. Skinny jeans and a cute top with converse or flats is a great outfit that's still simple.|`|GNPCDSSsaa	Skinny jeans, long t-shirt with belt over it. boots (ugg or something similar) straighten your hair, then curl it with hot curlers/curling iron wear eyeliner, mascara, and brown/natural eyeshadow, jewelry=matching clothes depending on belt and shirt which is like, a simple necklass, bangles matching the necklass, earrings matching the other stuff, and whatever else you want. glad i can help ?|`|AA10506154	I'd do jeans and a t-shirt (not white, maybe burgundy or dark pink, something girly but not bright). You dress it up from there with earrings, a necklace, some rings... Don't carry around a big purse. You don't wanna look like you have a grandma bag. Wear your usual make-up. If your hair is poofy, gel or mousse it and tie it back into a pony tail.
nhIM65uwaa	Its a turn on, but also a turn off.    Guys don't like loud, cocky girls, but they also like girls who are confident enough to approach them. (:|`|glynFK9haa	I probably wouldn't even consider you if you weren't shy, at this point.|`|mNtsrhnpaa	I think they're sweet|`|AA10598987	my guess would be if a guy likes u he will show it to u it doesnt matter if ure shy but what matters is ure personality|`|yW5rCmDwaa	I'm very shy as well! It hasn't stopped me from dating, but admittedly it takes me a bit longer to open up to guys....still, no guy I've ever dated has been turned off by my shyness. It's part of my personality, so I suppose in a way it was part of the attraction. Some guys like shy girls, while others prefer more outgoing. Don't worry....it won't stop guys from asking you out.|`|UwhyTsCKaa	I like when a girl is shy in public, quite, wont disrespect.  But i mean, if we are alone, and still she is shy, that's a huge turnoff and usually leads to a rejection.|`|QBV4cFbqaa	i think it depends on the guy or person. I'm really shy and i think that is why i've never been asked out. But i know this couple and the girl is really really shy, she seems so cute and innocent. Her boyfriend loves her that way. They seem like they very much in love.|`|DMMPfox8aa	I like that  I'm really shy too, i don't really talk too people much  i hope you find someone who can appreciate you, even if you are shy|`|HI0oQriqaa	if someone finds you attractive your being shy will not be a problem. people in general don't have time in their busy lives to notice that you are shy. i don't find shyness a bad quality in a girl. most shy girls can open up when you get to know them. if being shy is your only bad quality then you are a very nice person.|`|lK6FzBAuaa	turn off. i hate when people are shy (:  it shows that you don't really have confidence,  and confidence is the most important thing  any person could ever have(:|`|GXKCtmLraa	im a girl  its kinda weird.......sometimes.|`|LgdaV360aa	depends

Lol|`|kauRr6X8aa	Probably thin, small and flexible..|`|Ty5dBpFDaa	probably that your muscular,  but not like...a body builder.    also short? are you short?|`|eBxgZ0JOaa	it means she thinks you look like a gymnnast.  gymnasts are short, with broad shoulders, and very athletic looking.  http://www.gymn.ca/multimedia/photos/06j...    in other words, she called you skinny basically.  hope i helped!|`|ygiybahvaa	muscular, wide sholders, are you flexable, or double jointed? short, and shawn johnson looking!|`|AARZV2v0aa	it means you look toned and muscular! its a good thing =)|`|rXInAcURaa	it means your muscley, bulky, short maybe?|`|pdtAmIPyaa	gymnist is good!! means ur in shape and look like ur an acrobat-person|`|JsR4ypomaa	probably means you are really skinny and fit.   take it as a compliment|`|G2NoXxDVaa	maybe she thought you had a gymnast's body|`|14f5d1b00e3913722f81d4b3a53a087eaa	Usually skinny or toned and short with small boobies...I am not sure why their boobs are so small but check out some pics and you'll see what I mean.  LoL  HELL IDK|`|3dzuYTC5aa	Psychiatrist, gymnist..... hunny more than likely they were making fun of u..... its ok but people can be assholes. Neither one has to do with the other.  Gymnists .... u might be good in dance, gym class.... u might have a very flat chest.... or very slim and fit..... more than likely though thyey were being mean and u should ignore them nest time they probably walked off and laughed at u!!!!|`|z7qPR1Ntaa	well gymnasts are typicaly very short and muscular|`|I3g6rlQBaa	Maybe she thought you looked fit or healthy? I don't know.|`|u1yDAQJIaa	that you look fit|`|QBV4cFbqaa	Maybe she said that because you have good posture, and have a sporty look. Very put together and disciplined.|`|E9fwrBKHaa	Looking like a gymnast is either really fit or like really up-tight. She probably thought fit : )|`|nOmuccPnaa	I can't be for sure, but I don't see how that could be a bad thing! Gymnasts are in amazing shape so brush it off or take it as a compliment!|`|MWscJkwNaa	You are probably very fit and have toned muscles most likely because you work out. Also female gymnasts usually have nice butts but little up top|`|FQ5W5Xmoaa	yeah gymnasts are pretty short.. tiny...flatchested... lol|`|XnagKiegaa	im guessing it means you have the body of a gymnist. maybe your physical characteristics triggered her idea of someone you look like
wXloRCegaa	As a makeup artist, I would recommend a foundation primer and then a concealer for your problem areas and the liquid foundation.  You can follow it with a sheer powder but that's really just preference.  Here are some extra points...    1) Make sure your foundation color matches from your face to your neck to ensure a more natural appearance.    2) Use blush or bronzer to bring color back into your face after you've made it all one color with the foundation.    3) Use a highlighter such as Benefit's High Beam.  Dot it under your eyes and then over your cheek bones.  Then pat with your finger tip until there is a nice highlighted pink hue.|`|F8OrjeWsaa	liquid foundation or mousse gives the most coverage.   then press powder lightly over to set it.   preferably choose oil free if you have bad skin.|`|ygELhfO6aa	Try using concealer on your blemishes then putting foundation over it. What type you choose depends on your skin. If you have dry skin, stay away from the powder foundation. It can make your skin look really dry.|`|J9OUW7JRaa	ok so i had the same problem as you do with not knowing what to buy. One day i went to buy powder and i acedentaly bought this and its soo amazing! Its like a powder, but its like a liquid too. its creamy and it covers all my blemishes and red spots, but it doesnt look cakey either. Its amazing and you should try it    http://www.covergirl.com/products/produc...    Hope this helped :)|`|sLkMlt8kaa	I usually use both for that perfect look|`|AA12133586	i remcommed powder mineral makeup that would isnk in your skin instead of liquid foundation wear you might put too much in one place than the other then powder if u put too much on then it would look cakey.. I laso recommend using a primer before foundation like smashbox light primer and then  loose powder after foundation|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	Both, for flawless.  Foundation (on first) to cover, powder(over foundation) to soften out the look.

Hopefully it works.  GOOD LUCK!!!!! ???  carol|`|AA10019611	They're called nostrils, we all have em.      JK    You should see a doctor just to b sure that it isn't a sign for something serious then while you are there you should might as well ask him for advice.|`|OFGV2Jj2aa	did you know that everyone in the world has two big holes on the side of their nose? (well not everyone, I guss there are some people with birth defects but lets not get that technical) they are called nostrils, they help you breath, your going to be just fine, no, a tan wont get rid of them.|`|YHD4QE6Qaa	I have those too! Just one but on the front of my nose!|`|gRD8k1XEaa	are you talking about your nostrils??
DhExpMlnaa	I think you'd look fine. I know a lot of kids with the same proportions to weight and height and I think skinny jeans would look pretty good on you. :]|`|bH37fDw4aa	nooo you'll look good! :)|`|4EIebdn1aa	It would be fine.  Skinny jeans are really awesome because they look great and you don't have to always be pulling them out like those gangsta weirdos.|`|6LOhUx4paa	ya it would. guys look weird in skinny jeans.|`|8kfGyvlfaa	skinny jeans on a guy look wierd no matter how much you weigh    and btw- try baggy jeans...but not tooooo baggy|`|GXKCtmLraa	if its not ur style than u will look lke an idiot  ppl can tell if ur not in to it.  skinny no!  straight leg YES!  theres a diffrence! :)|`|sLkMlt8kaa	Mmhmm   If yo hair is not 'emo', you will look like a poser.|`|R2YjrRbYaa	Migth want to stick with the straightlegs...|`|wIRszCihaa	as long as you have hot hair, itd be ****** hott : )|`|XNBMzuxbaa	well i dont think so, im a girl and i weigh 128 but im 5'7. But guys are supposed to weigh more so I think your good!  YAY!  (idk im bored lol)  Oh and Im 14 too|`|EXWpMIZJaa	umm idk i think u should let the skinny jeans stay wit the girls, guys don't look that flattering in them srry to burst ur bubble|`|7tIdoDpMaa	i dontt thinkk boyss should wear skinny jeanss.|`|fxgMwo7iaa	I personally think skinny jeans look better on almost everyone, and since you're not huge, just get a pair. And if you're worrying about how people will react just wear them once and see what happens. The worst that could happen is nobody likes them and if you care about what they think just dont wear them anymore.|`|Ooptcf1yaa	I say you could work it.  I know a 14 year old boy who is around the same figure as you and he works them awesomely. =]  Just make sure they aren't super skinny.|`|m1zCa9LXaa	personally i don't like skinny jeans on boys, I think they look kind of werid, but then again it is up to you and what you want to wear. I really only see the sence and emo people wearing them.

sizRMfkAaa	You might just want to let your hair grow out a little more than you usually would before you go back to the barber. You will able to see where your natural hairline is and you can get a fresh cut and line. And if possible GET A NEW BARBER... if he can't do a better line than that and he's been doing your hair since 2007 or longer... he sucks... sorry|`|cWyQc7T7aa	Your hairline looks fine.      I don't know when the most recent pic was taken but if it was taken this year, it could be that your hairline is receding.  Yes, it happens to teens too.  It just depends on genetics.    Take a look at people on your mother's side of the family.  That side carries the bald gene.  If they are losing their hair, 8 times out of 10, you will too.    But again, your hairline looks nice.|`|lK6FzBAuaa	let your hair grow it should even out.by the way it's not that bad(:
UhDPjSz7aa	ya its totally cute  but if u want to make it a bit more fancy add some heels (not too big tho) or a belt or some bracelets [=|`|AA11383707	Yeah, it's cute. :)  But are those leggings or skinnies?

711855b069bddf243872284c4bc1bcd9aa	I have a few cartilage piercings so I think I might be able to help. First, it doesn't really matter what side, but like you said, you sleep on your right side, so for sure get it in your left ear because it is going to be tender for a little while after. Get it done with a needle, I've had it both ways and it hurts way less with a needle. It doesn't really even hurt that bad, just some discomfort while it is being done and it takes about 30 seconds to do it.  I wouldn't bother with anything to numb it, because it is over so fast and it's going to hurt a little bit anyway after the cream wears off, so it'll be a waste of money.  The only other thing you have to really remember is to keep it clean!!! I used spectrojel to clean it in the shower in the morning and then cleaned it with aftercare solution that I got from the piercing shop.  I also used pure lavender oil on it after each cleaning and it really helps with the little bit of throbbing that you may have for a few days after.  I think you are really going to love it, I have 3 now, and I love them all!! Good Luck with it!  I say again....clean clean clean.....you don't want an infection!|`|lJO1xbg6aa	1. I have one on my left ear. I think it looks better.    2. When I went in, I expected it to be the worst pain ever then after it was over, it seemed like nothing. It doesnt really hurt, you just get a warming sensation that lasts for a few seconds. It's really no big deal.    3. It might help if you don't take pain well but if you think you can handle it okay, then I suggest that you don't use it.    4. Never ever use a gun to get a cartilage piercing, always use a needle!! When you use a gun, you are more likely to get infections.    After you get it, make sure you clean it twice a day..trust me, you don't want an infected piercing like that!      Good luck =]
wXloRCegaa	You can do either!  It just depends on the look you're going for.  You will get more of a highlight effect if you do it after the bronzer and you'll get more of a subtle highlight if you do it before bronzer.  Try them both and see which one you like more.  There are no rules here, it's just preference.|`|UB7pWWHeaa	after
