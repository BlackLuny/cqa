20081118144242AAoVjOn	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Should I get a laptop or a smartphone?	I am in high school, and am trying to decide between 3 options: a smart phone, a netbook, and a laptop. I am in all accelerated classes, but my messy notes are practically useless, and so my grade struggles, although I have A's and B's. I have a nice gaming desktop, but I don't like Vista, and it's overkill for much else. I would be allowed to use the Netbook or Notebook in class, but not the Phone. I also want to start an online business doing programming or web design. And I want to be mobile, so battery life is a must. My parents would pay half either way, and they would be about equal in cost. The Smartphone would be the Touch Pro, on Sprint, the Laptop, would be a last gen, or bottom line Macbook, and the netbook would be the Eee PC 901, or the 6 Cell Windows MSI Wind. Please email me with any questions. So what do you think?

20090202021655AASpbmE	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	I can't load my computer past the log in screen.?	I have a HP laptop that I have had for about a month and it has Windows Vista Home Premium on it. Well I just went to go turn in my laptop and everything booted up fine and then it went to the log in screen where I put my password in. Well I put my password in and it goes to log me in and it seems that all is going well and then all that comes up for some reason instead of my normal screen is "My Documents" and nothing else, I can't see my wallpaper, the icons, the taskbar,  or anything but this file that is open and the background is just black. The good thing about it thought is I can navigate my whole computer with the file that is open and all my programs still work but I want it to go back to normal. I tried doing a system restore but I had no luck with that and I ran a virus scan and also had no luck with that either. So can someone please help me I am desperate.         Here is a link to what my screen looks like when I log in.  http://i55.photobucket.com/albums/g133/S...

I was sent an Excel spreadsheet today and when I opened it I noticed that there were hyperlinks embedded within the document.    Now i would expect this for fields like: "email address" and "website"    But there are links on fields like: "name" and "phone number"    They are not normal links either, just black text, no underline. But when you hover over the elements in the field, the cursor changes to a hand and a tooltip box pops up with info like the following:    "mailto:bob@roddy.com - Click to follow. Click and hold to select cell"    But the addresses listed in the tooltips have absolutely no association with the rest of the data. They seem to be random.    I scanned the document for viruses even before I opened it and it is supposedly clean.    How do I fix this? These mystery links go the full length of the column (even beyond the actual data).    Please help!

How do I make it so it doesn't suggest anything I type into google again? I've cleared out the history, but it still does that. Anyone have an answer?

Ok i recently built a computer for a friend, set up the internet for it and everything, but I was forced to go wireless against my better judgment, and her internet connection just WILL NOT stay consistent. It will constantly say it has a very good connection, but it is slow as hell and won't do **** for instance it will go as far as the myspace homepage but it won't log in except on rare occasion. I guess it might be the fact that its a very cheap cable connection from a company I had never heard of but still it shouldn't be this bad. It also doesn't help that she has a mother who has a lower IQ than a monkey with down syndrome breathing down my neck questioning my ear off about what I'm doing and trying to act like she knows how to fix it while I'm trying to work on it -.- . but anyways how could I improve the connection?

Later in the day, when I went to pull up all of the documents in this particular file from the flashdrive, the file was empty (O bites).  After freaking out for awhile, I started redoing a lot of the work, and it appeared to save correctly on the flashdrive.  Then I stupidly started messing around with my computer.  It said that I should degragment, so I did.  Then, when I went to check to see if it had recovered any files, I saw that ALL of my files - on my hardrive and on the flashdrive, are all messed up.  Most of them I cannot even open up (it says I need a decoder or something).  Did I completely lose all of this work by defragmenting??  I am a law student and a teacher, so needless to say, if this is truly gone, then I just lost over 200 hours of work.  How do I restore the files to pre-defragment status????

My friends pc is acting weird, sometimes it just hangs on the HP Splash screen, sometimes the video doesn't come on at all. Can't get into BIOS or Safe Mode.   Finally after a dozen tries it went into the BIOS, I changed the video from PCI to AGP integrated. Didn't make much difference, everything else seemed normal. Tried rebooting got stuck again at Splash screen. After waiting 10 minutes, it actually booted into XP, so I disabled system restore and got rid of about 60 different  virus and malware.    I thought maybe that was the problem, but upon reboot, I now get up to the XP splash screen and then all goes dark.   I'm wondering if the mobo might be buggy, cause when I first got the pc i opened it up and the heat sink was pretty clogged up and alot of blanket of dust pretty much covering the vents where the hard drive is.      It's just strange cause somtimes it boots up just fine, although for the specs it seems kinda slow. 2.6Ghz processor, 512 RAM, 60 G HD. I know those specs are not gonna be super fast but my pc almost the same and runs twice as fast.   FYI I used AVG, Malwarebytes, Ccleaner, Blacklight. I am in the middle of using MEMtest to check if maybe the RAM is shot.      I was also wondering if XP is vulnerable to boot sector viruses? Any other suggestions? Thanks.

20090202093805AA4ahSa	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Printers	Kodak AiO Printer won't print without color ink, but I only need black.?	So I have some stuff that I really need to print and bought some more black ink yesterday (my first refill since buying the printer) and everytime I try to print it says       Color ink cartridge needs replacing       1. Open the printer access door.    2. Insert a new color ink cartridge into the printer.    3. Close the printer access door.        Then it gives me the option of either ordering more ink online or cancel the printing all together, but what I am printing does not require color ink!!!  I just want it in BLACK!  I tried opening and closing the access door but it wouldn't fall for it, and it will not continue the print without replacing the color ink.  WHAT CAN I DO (besides buy ink I don't need)
