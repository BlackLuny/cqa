Even if you paraphrase a given dictionary to define a word you're using or provide details about its etymology or usage, it's best to cite which dictionary you used.<br>  <br>  But if you are just using it to look up words you're unfamiliar with while reading or to help you choose the right word while writing, then no, it's not necessary, as long as the meaning you are attaching to the word is a common one and not peculiar to that dictionary.

MC3ffGpgaa	I feel your pain, I dislike writing essays, but for some odd reason my essays seem to be quiet successful! First step is to clarify the main point you want to get across. This way you will have a center point, next you start at the beginning, the introduction. If this is an English or History essay for example introduce the piece of text by giving background information or time period. (Most of this is for writing an English essay'<br>  <br>  The first paragraph should follow from the last point made in the introduction. Make a statement then back it up with evidence and background information. The following paragraphs should follow in a similar pattern trying to link them as you go, for example if you are writing about 'To kill a Mockingbird' you may write 'Scout learnt many lessons EXAMPLE then who it was taught by' The next paragraph could follow 'The TEACHER also taught Scout.....'<br>  <br>  The last step is to write a conclusion, in this paragraph you want to clarify the main point and possibly expand on personal or 'the reader's veiw'.|`|AATFdSItaa	Okay! So, here is your basic structure for a basic essay. I use this for all of mine...<br>  <br>  Introductory Paragraph: You want to get the reader hooked, y'know? So, start with a random thought, or even a question "Did you know that..." or a fact. The last sentence should be your thesis statement. (What you're going to talk about) a boring thesis statement would be "In this essay, I'm going to talk about A, B, and C..." Make sense? Here's an example: Recycling is good because it preserves energy, reuses usable materials, and is better for the environment.   <br>  <br>  Paragraph 1: Should be the first thing you listed in your these statemtn. So, if i were writing an essay on recycling (which i'm not cause its spring break, wooo!;) the first paragraph would be about preserving energy. You would bring in points to back up your opinion. (Renewable resources, like wind and solar energy)<br>  <br>  Paragraph 2: Same thing, but with second thing mentioned in thesis statement.<br>  <br>  Paragraph 3: Same thing, but with the 3rd thing you mentioned in the thesis statement.<br>  <br>  The last thing you want is the Conclusion: You want to tie everything together, again, begin with an interesting fact or thought about your subject. Bring in some statistics..(56% of people recycle a week...) type of stuff, teachers love it. ;) Um, and THEN you really need to restate your thesis statement in a different way. Example: I support recycling because it sustains energy, uses already used material to their fullest, and benefits the environment.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped! Sorry if any of that was confusing! So all in all, a good, basic, 1-2 page double spaced essay is 5 paragraphs long, like i showed you.

Comparing the pay with certain other, it's hard not to get jealous but on the other hand, teaching pays a lot better than many jobs (construction, waitressing, etc.) that in some ways can be more difficult.  Teachers usually have some benefits that aren't factored into the pay---I have better insurance than many other people for a more reasonable price than others.

4A2IxqI6aa	This question is in the wrong category, but what the heck.<br>  <br>  When you a die once, there are 6 possible outcomes.  5 of them are not rolling a 2.  So, the chances are 5 in 6.<br>  <br>  When you roll it twice, there are 36 possible outcomes.  You figure this by multiplying the number of first possibilities by the second (which is the same in this case, because it's still a die).  But, there is only one outcome that is rolling both 2's.  So, the chance of not rolling a 2 is 35 in 36.<br>  <br>  Rolling it three times, you multiply by 6 again, for 216 possible outcomes.  Only one outcome is all 2's.  So, the chances of not getting all 2's is 215 in 216.|`|AA12095483	There are six sides on a die. The chance of getting a 2 is one in six.

NG1a49f3aa	I hate to say it, but you have given up on yourself. If you tell yourself that you are a C student and you can't do better- then you will be right.<br>  <br>  You admitted that you are not trying your best. What does occasionally mean? I would bet money that you do not pay attention A LOT more than you think. <br>  <br>  It is your mom's job as a parent to push you to do your best. She wants you to succeed and you are just barely making it now. The only person you should be upset with is yourself for being satisfied with C's. It is not a good habit to get into because an employer will not be satisfied with work that is "just ok".<br>  <br>  You went from an A student in Elementary School to a C student in Middle School- that means in high school, you will become an F student- at least according to your logic! Remember, high school is even harder and you need the skills you are learning now to succeed there.

05d05342b340961643a18c3d866ab89baa	Honey, I don't know if I can help you much or not, but here's my advice. I'm an old gal and I've been a teaching assistant for 24 years in an elementary school. I truly know the type you're talking about. The more they see they can aggravate you the more they pour it on. I wouldn't let her get my goat and that will probably shut her up. I'd just come back at her with something like," You are just too smart to misunderstand me and I know you must be kidding." Whatever she says just hold your cool and say some funny remark to her. There is a little boy at my school who loves to cuss in front of the other kids. One day he was in my room alone with me and he was just cussing and I ignored him. He said,"I worked my A-- off this weekend." I replied, " Well I did too." After he saw he couldn't get a rise out of me he shut up. Now if there had been other children present I couldn't have let him say those words. Good luck Sweetie!!!!!!!!!|`|SmPdl2RPaa	You are a TEACHER your supposed to help her out with anything she doesn't get and if she is that annoying Transfer her!|`|IfKTQME0aa	If she says she not understanding anything just when you have finished a lecture you should ask her for clarification.  Say, "I could help you if you could narrow down what it is that you don't understand". Or "do you have a specific question that I can address"  She will probably not want to or be able to narrow it down because it unfortunately sounds like she is a complaining.  I found I had some students who would get so stressed during a lecture when the subject matter was not immediately "clear" without additional follow up study.  I think this relates to study habits...they sometimes don't read material beforehand and in the past learning (in high school) may have been easy so they don't know how to put in the effort or don't feel effort should be required to learn.  If you give reading assignments beforehand then she is expected to have read and your lecture is supplemental.  You should tell her this rather than telling her not to interrupt the class.  She may truely feel that she is totally loss and has no idea how to address it.  If she continues after you give her more guidence on study habits and "how to learn" advice and her disruptions bother you suggest a study partner from the class.  You must set limits on your time and not feel guilty about it.  If I had to guess she is probably from a family that expected straight As, went to a high school that force fed education to boost standardized test scores and has never really learned how to put in the time.  You can help her by addressing only her study habits (rather than reexplaining subject matter) followed by addressing only specific questions that she asks.|`|VgyGeLamaa	Sounds to me like she's doing it for the attention.  <br>  <br>  Next time she "doesn't understand anything" just tell her that because of policy/time constraints/under the circumstances... she'll have to come in during office hours.<br>  <br>  If she's legitimately confused she'll make the effort to see you privately, if she's doing if for the attention she'll have some rebuttal about why she can't make office hours.  Don't give her the satisfaction of an argument!  At this point you stress that your policy exists out of fairness to you and all students.  <br>  <br>  IF class time is being used for the maximum benefit of all students - be prepared to spend some time doing exactly that.  At which point you use peer pressure: "Is there anyone else that's completely lost?" If several people raise their hand than it's YOUR problem and you need to make your assignments more clear with a rubric or better directions.  If she's the only one then the lack of others on her side will wear her down and eventually silence her.  And if she's the only one then it's back to policy reinforcement.<br>  <br>  Alternately, you may suggest that her question is too general to spend time on it with class letting out, suggest that one of her friends help explain it to her or again reinforce that you have office hours for this reason.  Give her your office phone number too if you think that will help.<br>  <br>  She may also have some hidden grudge and enjoy seeing you embarrassed... don't react.  Be very business like, show no emotion and reinforce your policy.|`|NuJako4gaa	ask the student in privacy, what dont you understand?<br>  and tell her to plz stop shouting out

Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea." - Antoine de Saint Exupery<br>  <br>  A prime function of the leader is to keep hope alive. --John Gardner<br>  <br>  Divide and rule, a sound motto. Unite and lead, a better one.  Johann Wolfgang von Goethe<br>  <br>  Robert K. Greenleaf, founder of the Greenleaf Center for Servant-Leadership in Indianapolis, said, "The great leader is seen as a servant first, and that simple fact is the key to his greatness."<br>  <br>  Leadership is both something you are and something you do. A mentor is not a person who can do the work better than his followers; he is a person who can get his followers to do the work  better than he can. -- Fred Smith<br>  <br>  A leader is a person with a magnet in his heart and a compass in his head. -- Vance Havner<br>  <br>  The supreme quality for a leader is unquestionably integrity. --       Dwight D. Eisenhower<br>  <br>  Advice from Ross Perot about how to treat your people: <br>   “Never ask anyone to do what you haven’t done before and wouldn’t do again. That’s a pretty fundamental rule in leadership...treat them like you treat yourself. Things you don’t like, they don’t like. You don’t like to be jerked around, they don’t either.   You don’t like to be talked down to, and they don’t either. You would rather work with somebody than for somebody. So would they. You hate people who pound on your head after you gave everything you had and failed… It’s that simple.”<br>  <br>  “It is the job of a leader to make it easy for people to do the  right thing, difficult to do the wrong thing.”<br>  <br>  He that would be a leader must be a bridge.     -- Welsh Proverb <br>  <br>  You do not lead by hitting people over the head. That's assault, not leadership.    -- Dwight D. Eisenhower<br>  <br>  The beauty of empowering others is that your own power is not diminished in the process.  Barbara Colorose<br>  <br>  <br>  Know yourself.<br>  Don't accept your dog's <br>  admiration as evidence <br>  that you are wonderful.
CR7arBmbaa	Ohhhhhh....ok then! lol!<br>  <br>  Yeah, there usually isn't a specifc word for that one. They usually just say "Can I use it???" or "will I be able to have that next???...." so it's usually just "it" or "that" I guess  :  )<br>  <br>  Wooby would never be asked...that's was very specific to my son....if he saw a kid with a blanket and he wanted it for some reason he would just say "Can I see your blanket?"<br>  <br>  Think of a kid who names a Teddybear. Their bear is very much "theirs" so it has a name.  Another kid walking by with a bear would just be asked "Hey, can I see your Teddybear?"  <br>  <br>  Just like there's only one Mom :  ) other adults never get called mom.<br>  <br>  anyway, no specific name for the general toy though, lol!|`|uaxliXB3aa	I think that you can use the word wooby if you're meaning the blanket. Other than that, I think you would be good saying "blanket".

If you go in state you'll be paying in-state tuition which is about half of what you'll pay if you go out of state.<br>  Scholarships.  Did you get scholarships for any of the colleges?<br>  Surrounding Area.  How do you like it?  Try and visit all that you can because this can be very important.<br>  School Rankings.  Are there schools in your list that have better ranked programs for the major you're looking at?<br>  Dorm availability.

You can continue your education on the job and attend college to further your career.|`|Icoa7T2raa	You really don’t need a college degree to get hired, but it never hurts to have one.

Usually, communities colleges will give you credit for your fire academy and EMS classes toward that degree.  Just remember to finish a degree!

Though I can say this.<br>  <br>  body paragraph B should be your 2nd paragraph after your thesis paragraph, as it has to do with stament 3 in thesis.  But the points in B should be  3, then 1 and then 2.  <br>  <br>  Your ignoring thesis point 2, which properly should be your first paragraph after your thesis paragraph.  You must say something to back this up, contrast racism in the times<br>  <br>  The 3rd paragraph after the thesis should have to do with thesis point 4.  Illustrate this with examples from the book.<br>  <br>  Lastly, make sure everything ties in with your conclusion.  Your conclusion should be very similar to your thesis, but not an exact duplicate.  Reword Conclusion 1, and put conclusion 2 in front of it - not as a conclusion, but to back up the conclusion in the paragraph.|`|IGXE3aDraa	for c and d you could do an outline on the judge or the lawyers. you could also do a paragraph on racism today.

Will I be living in the area where there will be people speaking my chosen language?<br>  <br>  You live near French speakers which means you are probably near Quebec where French is mandatory.  If you took French you would have constant exposure to the Language (reinforces your ability to speak French) and you would be more likely to find someone to help you properly speak French.|`|N7ZnaF27aa	The easiest language to learn would be latin - like 60% of english words have latin roots, so you can pretty much figure out all the words just from what they sound like. Many french and spanish words also have latin roots, so if you learn latin it would be a lot easier to learn another language as well. <br>  <br>  But, on the other hand if you live in a place where lots of people speak french, and you already know that you don't like spanish, then french would be a good option too. :)|`|5iIPROd5aa	Take Spanish<br>  <br>  1.

zgTsCicNaa	Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, now say they have discovered the part of the brain that is responsible for déj?u; they say neurons in the memory centre of the brain called the hippocampus make a mental map of new places and experiences, then store them away for later use.<br>  <br>  They believe that déj?u occurs when two events or places are very similar to each other, overlap and thus the feeling of déj?u takes place.<br>  <br>  Susumu Tonegawa, a professor of biology and neuroscience at the Institute says déj?u occurs when this ability is challenged, and it is very important for an intelligent animal such as human beings so they are aware of what is going on around them and are then able to recall it later.<br>  <br>  For their study, researchers used mice which have similar brain structures to humans.<br>  <br>  Half the mice were genetically altered and were missing a gene in a specific part of the hippocampus, the others were healthy and they were trained to differentiate between different locations by giving them a tiny electric shock when they entered a particular spot.<br>  <br>  When the mice were transferred from cage to cage they were given the shock in one specific cage; the healthy mice learned to realize which cage posed the dangerous shock, while the other mice were unable to do so. <br>  <br>  Tonegawa says since they know the molecular and cellular pathway based on their results, there is a possibility to use those molecular targets to develop a drug to improve this connection.<br>  <br>  The research is published in the journal Science. <br>  <br>  ?

r5Mxre6Saa	Origins of the term<br>  The first use of the term "Cold War" to describe post-World War II geopolitical tensions between the Soviet Union and the US has been attributed to American financier and US presidential advisor Bernard Baruch.[1] In South Carolina on April 16, 1947, Baruch gave a speech written by journalist Herbert Bayard Swope,[2] in which he said, "Let us not be deceived: we are today in the midst of a cold war."[3] Columnist Walter Lippmann also gave the term wide currency, with the publication of his 1947 book titled Cold War.[4]<br>  <br>  The site below has all the info you'll need.  Have fun!  :)<br>  <br>  The term had previously been used by George Orwell in an essay entitled "You and the Atomic Bomb" which appeared in the British newspaper Tribune on October 19, 1945. However, while contemplating a world living in the shadow of nuclear war and warning of a "peace that is no peace", which he called a permanent "cold war",[5] Orwell did directly refer to that war as the ideological confrontation between the Soviet Union and the western powers.[6]|`|uoJLgORkaa	Do your own homework!

If you work hard and are determined, you won't have any problems. I was asked to be in Honors English my freshman year too and didn't know whether I should do it or not, but I went for it and found that wasn't as hard I thought it would be.

v5SXqxo0aa	Completely, if the student wanted to be an engineer and get a job right away. Cal Poly and Pomona are both CSUs, meaning they take a hands-on approach to their majors. This enables students to get practical experience that prepares them for the outside world immediately. <br>  <br>  However, if the student wanted to go to grad school right after, I would recommend a UC. Not to say Cal Poly and Pomona do not prepare their students for grad school, but UCs are more grad school oriented, while CSUs are more job oriented. Another reason not to pick Cal Poly is the lack of diversity; I believe Sonoma is about 60-65% white, but a great school nonetheless if the student does not mind. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

FYI, some of the answers in all the books are wrong, so if something seems off, ask a parent or teacher. <br>  <br>  If the school makes up it's own test, ask around about that particular school test, ask which standardized test (ISEE, HSPT, SSAT) it is most like, and study that book.

If you're not allowed to use a calculator, this requires a little calculus, but you can tell by inspection that the answer to #1 should be a tiny bit less than 7.  Here're the formulae:<br>  <br>  f(x) = x^(1/2)<br>  f'(x) = (1/(2 * x^(1/2))(dx)<br>  Let x = 49, dx = -1<br>  f'(x) = (1/(2 * 7))(-1) = -1/14<br>  <br>  Thus, the answer is approximately 7 - 1/14 = 6.93.  Alternatively, if you were just trying to strictly simplify it, note that 48 = 16 * 3, so the square root of 48 is (the square root of sixteen) times (the square root of three), or 4 * (square root of three).<br>  <br>  2.  The same methods can be applied to this.  If you just want to simplify, note that 864 is 144 * 6, therefore the square root of 864 is 12 * (square root of 6).  If you want the actual answer and can't use a calculator, you have to do calculus.<br>  <br>  g(x) = x^(1/2)<br>  g'(x) = (1/(2 * x^(1/2))(dx)<br>  Let x = 841, dx = 23<br>  NOTE: because dx is large, this will be a fairly rough estimate<br>  g'(x) = (1/(2 * 29))(23) = 23 / 58<br>  <br>  Thus, g(864) = g(841) + (23 / 58) = 29.4

In my experience the two most common methods were called "combination" and "substitution".  Two linear equations can also be solved by graphing, but this is only helpful if you have a graphing calculator or similar and are allowed to use it (and not show your work).<br>  <br>  Since the coefficients on x and y are both 1 in the second equation, it will probably be easier to solve by substitution.  To do this, solve for either x or y in the second equation.  (If only one of the variables had a coefficient of 1, then it would be easier to use that one, but you have the option because they both do.)<br>  <br>  Whichever variable you solve for, substitute for that variable in the first equation and solve for the only remaining variable.<br>  <br>  Once you know either x or y, substitute that number into either of the original equations and solve for the second variable.

Ask them questions about what kinds of foods they were fed as children, or what their average day was like, watching tv or going to the pool? Things like that.

JqoLBUMSaa	universities.atwebpages.com - try this site.

Here's why:<br>  <br>  If your award package includes a Pell Grant and a student loan (and other monies), those funds will be disbursed to the school, one-half for each of two terms of the school year. When your tuition and fees are paid, the difference will be disbursed to you. BUT if you owe the school money for other things (previous tuition, fees, parking tickets, etc.) the money CANNOT be released to you until all those debts are taken care of.<br>  <br>  Transportation is a legitimate education-related expense. BUT if you are able to use your mom's or dad's car, just do that and save yourself from accumulating any debt you don't have to. Further, depending on where you are in school, you will probably be able to pull a few thousand dollars (max) for a car. This means an older, used car with a boatload of problems that will require even more expense.|`|SIhxrxD3aa	Yes.  You can get a student loan while you have a pell grant.  You were probably already offered a stafford loan along with your pell grant and you either declined it or when you filled out the FAFSA you said you weren't interested.  Contact your financial aid office and they can get you set up with one.

Some people tend to stare, and it doesn't mean anything.<br>  <br>  Some people are uncomfortable with normal social touching, are you like that? (There is nothing wrong with that, but just realize if you are so you can properly judge his actions.) Do any of your girlfriends say something to you, not in response to your comments, but on their own, about his actions towards you? <br>  <br>  I would wait a week and really think about what is going on. (But don't be alone with him.) What are his actions towards you, are they really innocent or ?? When I was in high school, my girl friend thought as you did, only I was sure it was innocent because I knew that teacher was sooo gay. (But it was back in the stone age so he was way in the closet, but my family knew friends of his.) He was kind of odd and uncomfortable with people, so his actions seemed a bit off and could be taken wrong. Of course, if your teacher gets obviously inappropriate during the week, speak to your parent. I'd take it to a parent and let them speak to your principal. Or you tell him, Just cut it out!! (If you do that, be sure you have friends who can act as witnesses to his previous behavior if he starts treating you unfairly. )<br>  <br>  I had a teacher with a crush on me when I was in 11th grade. Geesh, he was very young and would watch my boyfriend play sports and he'd make all kind of complimentary comments to me which made me uncomfortable. But he didn't really cross any big line. He was a long term substitute for a teacher who got ill, so he left at the end of the year. He put his phone # and his mother's (!) phone # in my yearbook. ugh We had 2 students who married teachers right after graduation and a teacher, an ex-nun, who was messing around with one of my male friends.

wtQY6VEwaa	At first I just kind of went with the flow. I was always a terrible student up till college. When I got to college, I didn't do much better. I just managed to do my homework and get by on tests. But I did alright. My grades weren't the best, but I passed and they weren't terrible.<br>  <br>  It wasn't until I was sure that I wanted to apply to law school that I really started to try. I never knew how to study or do anything, so I basically had to start from scratch. I watched the smartest people in the class who got the best grades. I always knew that I was smarter than those people and could do better than them if I just put my mind to it.<br>  <br>  So I did. I am competitive, and that was my motivation to go to the library and study every day. I knew that I wanted to have the best grade on the tests and in the class. So that motivated me to do well.<br>  <br>  As for study habits, you really need to experiment and find what works for you. Some classes require you to work with a group or partner; others require you to work on you own. Some people like to go to the library and not have distractions; others like to be comfortable at home.  So you really need to find out what works for you.<br>  <br>  Just find your motivation and use it and you will succeed.|`|KM2EPk2saa	I studied.

As far as pages and quotes go, I don't really know what to tell you, but in my opinion and just from what I've read...<br>  <br>  Tom is treated differently and distrusted for an obvious reason: He's black. He's black and he's being charged with raping a white woman. In those days who would trust a black man's word to 2 white people's?<br>  <br>  Bob - It seems to me that Bob would be treated differently because of his lifestyle. The entire family is lacking in maturity, cleanliness, money... things of that nature. Part of why he's treated differently is because he wants to be. Why would be live his life any different when he's getting all he needs for free? Maycomb just hands them what the Ewells need.<br>  <br>  Scout - Scout is a girl, but a definite tom boy. She has grown up without a mother, or any female relatives to teach her what she should do to become a proper lady. People judge her wrongly because of the way she thinks, and her radical honesty, I suppose you could say. She wears overalls as opposed to a dress, and she has more boy friends than girls.<br>  <br>  Boo - He hasn't come out of his house for years. Everyone thinks of the Radleys as peculiar because they don't participate in any community activity, such as church, which is what everyone did in those times. They are basically distrusted, because they've never had any dealings with the neighborhood. <br>  <br>  Well.. I suppose that's about it... Hope I helped, sorry if I didn't.<br>  :)

"most smartest" is not a reflection of this.|`|MJMsOFpiaa	Surprisingly I find that the smartest girl in school isn't some nerd. She's a well balanced person who is just really smart. So she doesn't have to work too hard to be the smartest, and no one looks at her like she's a freak. She's just a smart person.<br>  Also school isn't neccessarily based on smartness, it's more based on how well you can do what the teacher asked. So the smartest doesn't necessarily get the best grades.|`|ivkGknUsaa	"most smartest" is not even right. anyways, list down the common positive qualities of any smart girl (smart, intelligent, responsible, etc.), get a thesaurus, and find the "new vocabulary" synonyms of the words you listed...|`|ydHU7gYIaa	what do you mean, "new vocabulary?" for starters, dont say things like "most smartest". thats terrible grammar.|`|xmudxxBHaa	since everyone else already seems to have commented of the grammer mistake here are some adjectives...<br>  intellectual<br>  studious<br>  apt<br>  acute <br>  intelligent<br>  insightful

AA10129759	I attended a competency based school. I received an excellent education, but I learned most of my important skills when I started working in a salon. You really only have time to learn the basics in school. When you work in a salon you have the entire staff you can learn from, and this is what will make your skills grow. When you do get to work in a salon, ask questions, pay attention to what other stylists are doing - i.e. how is the most popular stylist communicating w/ his/her customers, what is the top $$ earner doing - perms, cuts, color...these things are important. <br>  <br>  Also, you do not have to take a loan. Look into government grants, scholarships, etc. My education wasn't exceedingly expensive, but money was very tight in my family. Thanks to a grant and two scholarships, most of it was paid for with only some supplies being left to be paid out-of-pocket.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

I might have a couple of ideas.. You might not like them however..<br>  <br>  lust - Lust finally got the better of an individual, and when he was tempted, he took the offer, unknowing that they person he was about to become intimate with was already taken by like someone in a mob or something lol. Then when they are caught, the woman betrays the man and says he raped her or drugged her or something. haha<br>  <br>  gluttony - We'll go with food on this one. Some fatty over-indulges in a delicious meal at a party hosted by someone he is a secret rival with. The person still can't resist, however. They dig in and later that night come to realize that the food has been poisoned. Something to that effect.<br>  <br>  sloth - a lazy person plans to change theire ways, but of course hasn't gotten around to it yet. In the mean time, they are presented with some form of opportunity. Take your pick, as I'm sure there are plenty of places you could go with that one.. and they just sit around until the opportunity passes them by. When they finallly see the error of their ways and choose to change, they realize that their one and only opportunity to do whatever has passed them by, and they must live with that mistake for the rest of their life.<br>  <br>  :) <br>  Hope I was some inspiration.. haha

Plus, you won't have to worry so much about feeding yourself - a cafeteria is likely nearby. At this point, yeah you might think it'd be great to go out on your own and live in an apartment, but it really is nice to just hold off of taking on that responsibility just yet.<br>  <br>  After those two years, you'll be well-settled and really ready to move off-campus. It's the perfect time to do so.<br>  <br>  A comment about the bathrooms: yes, you probably will have to share a community bath in a dorm. BUT, these are cleaned EVERY DAY. I doubt that any student is voluntarily going to do that in his own apartment! ;)  Good luck!|`|WvUo4fi8aa	Apartment is more spacious, you have your own bathroom, kitchen and a bedroom, wardrobe exclusively for yourself and certainly more privacy. <br>  Dorm being on campus saves commutation time, besides you get to enjoy the various activities on campus.

wF3YmF4Naa	Hey don't beat yourself up. Sometimes people just don't learn the same way as others. My advice would be to go to your teachers and ask if they would mind meeting with you outside of class to help explain things better. If the teachers are even remotely decent, they'll want to help you and not see you drop out. You might just need a one on one atmosphere to help you learn. That way you can ask the questions you need to ask and not have to ask them in front of the class where you might be embarrassed. <br>  Be honest about what the fears and emotions you just expressed to your parents and teachers. Please don't give up though. Education is the key to a better life and you should never just give up on it.|`|QRrURcQDaa	I am also Freshman.

AA10510845	It has nothing to do with tea.  It's just a euphemism for "dish towel". Probably some prissy Victorian ladies coined the phrase back in the 19th century, where everything was ostensibly very proper. You didn't dare use cuss or slang words, and with manners so strict, it was probably really hard to enjoy a meal when you had to be so careful of etiquette.  And they had prim and proper names for just about everything.  For example, when a woman was pregnant, you never used that word.  It suggested vulgarity.  You'd say, instead, "in a family way"...How quaint!  Well, I never intended such a dissertation, but that's how tea towels got named.  "Dish towels" sounded too down to earth.|`|27de0a37435f041ae3d6417353f06c88aa	Most probably to identify the towel which has to be used just for drying and cleaning the tea-dishes.<br>  <br>  Franky|`|EuMtcP33aa	to hold the hot teapot? or mop up the drips from the teapot?|`|gUg300Mmaa	Both previous answers have a point.

Kxj4FDHzaa	Romeo is a passionate, extreme, excitable, intelligent, and moody young man, well-liked and admired throughout Verona. He is loyal to his friends, but his behavior is somewhat unpredictable. At the beginning of the play, he mopes over his hopeless unrequited love for Rosaline. In Juliet, Romeo finds a legitimate object for the extraordinary passion that he is capable of feeling, and his unyielding love for her takes control of him.<br>   <br>  Juliet, on the other hand, is an innocent girl, a child at the beginning of the play, and is startled by the sudden power of her love for Romeo. Guided by her feelings for him, she develops very quickly into a determined, capable, mature, and loyal woman who tempers her extreme feelings of love with sober-mindedness.<br>   <br>  The attraction between Romeo and Juliet is immediate and overwhelming, and neither of the young lovers comments on or pretends to understand its cause. Each mentions the other’s beauty, but it seems that destiny, rather than any particular character trait, has drawn them together. Their love for one another is so undeniable that neither they nor the audience feel the need to question or explain it.|`|WkbN9hf1aa	first Juliet was kind of selfish for wanting romeo and not thinking of her parents then in the end when she kills herself she dies for love,for romeo (not selfish at all)the audience is going to be surprised|`|LNnRSLdtaa	we cant tell you the language <br>  youl have to analyse that from the text you have been given <br>  <br>  juliet has changed quite dramaticly<br>  at the start shes very obedient and 'happy' in her life<br>  then she has a secret wedding and fakes her death to be with romeo <br>  when that goes wrong she kills herself<br>  <br>  im not going to tell you the answers but ive just given you something to think about|`|qKUMaJcXaa	Juliet matures into a brave adult (she risks death with potion)

I had a friend born in June.  She entered and exited each grade without having her birthday and was on the young side.

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	To find out the rules and regulations regarding homeschooling, I suggest you visit this site: <a href="http://www.HSLDA.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.HSLDA.org</a> and find the link for England.  There will probably be links to associations and organizations near you that can help you, too.<br>  <br>  Homeschooling has been a WONDERFUL experience for our family.  And, though I have not read the other answers yet I am sure there are, or if not there will be soon, some suggesting it causes people to be social outcasts.  School is not the only, and it is definitely not the best, place to socialize.<br>  <br>  I wish I could give you more information, but I am in the U.S.A. and I am sure the process is a little different here.  I wish you the best, though!|`|fAA3rjTbaa	it depends, it could be good or bad it depends on how hard you will push your daughter, and how hard she will push herself(when you can't teach her some of her latter classes)|`|IeTfFv29aa	Why are you immediately jumping to home schooling as an option if your daughter is unhappy?<br>  Have you identified the source of her feelings?  Have you had some discussions with her teacher and the principal?<br>  <br>  I ask because homeschooling is a larger responsibility and done incorrectly, can cause your child to lag behind her peers.  Unfortunately I have seen the negative effects although I know there are many success stories.<br>  <br>  In answer to your quesitons: Is it a good thing?  I would say no because of the social/emotion lessons she learns by being in school.  She has to discover methods for dealing with the variety of people she encounters.  This, of course, should be facilitated by the teachers and staff as children don't know how to do this.<br>  Also, you pulling her out teaches her that you can fix the problems she has, and unfortunately, parents cannot protect their children from the world.  Part of school is learning to manage oneself inside the complexity  of the "chaos"|`|Wscsgyd5aa	In some states in America you would need your teaching credentials to home school your kids and you have to follow a government issue for curriculum. Parents most often home-school their children when they believe they can give them more attention than they would receive at public school. The drawback of homeschooling is the lack of socialization. Is your daughter having social problems at school? Or is she having trouble keeping up her grades? I think you should investigate the reasons as to why she, your daughter, wants to be home schooled.|`|B3uvhA7kaa	Well, it's good and bad.<br>  Good:<br>  There are no isses/drama with other students.<br>  Your daughter can focus on sections of learning that she may be having trouble with.<br>  They won't move on until she understands everything.<br>  All the attention is on her, so she gets a full understanding and education of everything.<br>  <br>  Bad:<br>  She won't make friends or be able to hang out with them.<br>  Social skills will go down.<br>  Basically, it's everything social that goes bad.|`|kSZstQ6Paa	i say its not really good cause she can`t know how to start a <br>  conversation or have Friends with other people but if she feels good<br>  about it i think that's ok i don`t know much though

Whenever you go into high school, you make new friends.  Friends that you can relate to better than those right now.  It's just a natural part of life.<br>  <br>  Use your intelligence.  Take AP classes in the subjects that you are strongest in.  Taking these classes will help train your mind in doing better on the SAT which will get you a better scholarship and placement at the university level.  Furthermore, you won't have to worry about wasting time and money taking these courses in college.|`|AA11989999	OK, you are a brainy child. I was too, 50 years ago.

Expect to make NEW friends in your AP classes, and then your old friends might call you stuck-up. That will be happening also when you go off to college, and maybe beyond. <br>  Besides your AP classes, you should take one "fun" class per semester, like crafts, cookery, art, music, etc. <br>    Life is an adventure, not a book story that lays it all out for you :-)|`|4be6c5b4c2a18bd2a8a48c2dff0419ceaa	i was scared at first but when you actually attend the classes it was just the same thing...BORING....i never took AP classes but it's just the same courses as the others but you go faster and go into more detail stuff....all you need to do is study...all my classes are honors and advanced and it had been a breeze if i had taken AP i would have managed to pass but i didn't take it b/c you have to pay to take the AP exams...there are alot of people so don't worry you would mangaged to make friends...i mean i'm a really shy and quiet person but i managed to make friends....<br>  <br>  and of course you should talk to your counselor...your counselor has more knowledge and is trained on preparing you to go to college...<br>  <br>  advices: don't procrasinate...pay attention in class...do your work...study for tests/exams...be yourself and enjoy...join a club if you have to...|`|kSZstQ6Paa	To get over the fear of high school be good in school and get good<br>  grades i have a cousin that just started high school in Ohio <br>  he says its kinda bad but if you don`t do Drugs (Etc) then<br>  your life in high school will be fine,but also don`t go with people<br>  that your parents view as bad company. and your life will be pretty much fine|`|uS8nNpB8aa	Don't overburden yourself.

JBoRCQpOaa	Jem was really protective over her.<br>  They were like best friends because Scout was a bit more tom boy<br>  <br>  Jem alwas tred to set a good example for her<br>  and told her wrong from right like when Scout is having a fight in the play ground|`|uVftXqubaa	At the start of the book, Jem is protective of Scout and watches out for her, as well as trying to teach her what not to do at school. He establishes that he thinks he is better because he's a boy and is older, and uses this to make Scout do things she may not want to do, such as creep to the Radley's backyard. Over the course of the book, the siblings drift apart slightly as Scout becomes a little more girly and Jem prefers to do things separately from her, however, he is still protective of her as he sees this as his duty as her older brother. Following their experience with the court case and Bob Ewell, they become close again as they share many life affecting experiences in the space of few months.<br>  <br>  Sorry this is so long but i hope it helps anyway :)|`|9A2qByAUaa	Talk about Jem being protective of scout, his younger sister. Jem always looks out for her.|`|xJoMSkI5aa	As older brother to Scout, Jem looks out for her and tries to get her to do what he, in his superior knowledge from being four years older, knows she should do.

The Boo Radley play-acting game starts out as one of these ego-boosts.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Jem and Scout/To Kill A Mockingbird

CgOs2ViPaa	practice practice practice. seriously, the only way to get better on the SAT is to practice over and over again. especially with CR, since it's not like you can really study for it like you can study for math/writing. i used the barron's cr book and it upped my score slightly... 600 to 620. haha its not very much but i'll take it. <br>  <br>  oh and dont only focus on cr because math is actually really easy to raise your score because the curve is so skewed. and in writing, focus on the basic grammar concepts and once again, practice. and aim for a 10 on the essay.|`|sFMo5Q5Vaa	Practice will probably give you the best results for the critical reading section. For the other sections, though, you may want to review rules of grammar, math formulas, and math concepts. These simple things each day for 20 minutes should improve your score substantially in a week. You may also want to try to learn some new vocabulary words and use the words you learn in your vocabulary.

AA10176626	Captain:<br>  <br>  If you're looking around grants.gov, you've missed the answer to your question - and unfortunately, that answer is that the government does not offer grants to assist individuals with financial hardship.<br>  <br>  When you're on the <a href="http://grants.gov" rel="nofollow">http://grants.gov</a> page, click on "About Grants.gov" on the left hand side of the page. Now click on "Who is eligible for a grant?", where you'll find these two passages:<br>  <br>  "ATTENTION! Grants.gov does not offer money for personal financial assistance or debt. If you are seeking personal financial assistance such as:<br>  <br>  Social Security/Supplemental Security Income, Medicaid or State Social Services, please visit: <a href="http://www.GovBenefits.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.GovBenefits.gov</a><br>  <br>  Student Loans, please visit: <a href="http://www.Studentaid.ed.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.Studentaid.ed.gov</a><br>  <br>  Small Business Start-up Loans, please visit: <a href="http://www.sba.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.sba.gov</a><br>  <br>  This type of individual assistance is NOT available on this website."<br>  <br>  and  <br>  <br>  "We have all seen them, late night infomercials, websites, and reference guides, advertising "millions in free money" Don't believe the hype! Although there are many grants on Grants.gov, few of them are available to individuals and none of them are available for personal financial assistance. To find an alphabetical listing of federal personal assistance visit USA.gov website's Government Benefits, Grants, and Financial Aid page."<br>  <br>  As those passages explain, the government does not award grants for personal financial assistance - hardship or otherwise. What you are looking for is a government benefits program - and I'm sure you've heard of some of these before.<br>  <br>  There are well-known programs like Veteran's benefits, disaster relief, food stamps, medicaid and TANF (which used to be called welfare), and there are lesser-known, state programs, like LIHEAP (Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program), which help very low income households keep their electricity and heat turned on. For more info on the full range of government benefits programs, visit <a href="http://www.govbenefits.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.govbenefits.gov</a> , or contact your local state Division of Family Services.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!

If you are taking the SAT after 2 months, then I suggest getting a SAT book / privite tutor depending on you budget. If you have less then two months, I would go over the math section specifically and learn how to solve problems that you don't know. Reading and writing are mostly applying knowledge, but the trick to math is that you usually have to know how to solve the problem before applying it.<br>  <br>  for taking the actual test:<br>   if you have extra time, I warn you not to check your problems and instead work on some other problem: remember this isn't a mmath or english test; you don't have time to check your work and change answers, you only lose a fraction of a point if you get it wrong so it's better to go on another problem for a whole point! <br>  <br>  for colleges, i say that you go to collegeboard.com and find the college that fits you by answering their survey <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!

Now, you may have difficulty if they are also learning English.  However, this might be a great opportunity for the parents to build their own skills.  You may want to model in small groups to the parents how to work with a text and a specific strategy.<br>  Also, contact your local HS and identify some students who could work as tutors with your children.  They may have a program that allows them to work during the school day assisting younger students.
AA10176626	I'm a little confused by your question.<br>  <br>  Though there are scholarships that only available to state residents, most institutional scholarships are awarded to any eligible student. Just as the schools would like to keep the "best and the brightest" at home, the schools also want to attract the "best and the brightest" from other regions of the country. Many schools offer a scholarship specifically to off-set the out-of-state tuition fees that might otherwise discourage non-state residents from applying.<br>  <br>  Non-institutional scholarships - the awards offered by private organizations and corporations - work the same way. There are some scholarships that are only open to state residents, but most scholarships are available to all applicants.<br>  <br>  Your biggest question is not a question of scholarship eligibility. If you move to Arizona to attend college, you will be classified as a non-state resident for tuition purposes, and you will pay at least 40% more for your education than your state-resident classmates.<br>  <br>  Contrary to somewhat popular opinion, it is highly likely that you will continue to be classified as a non-resident for your entire 4 years of school. Arizona, like nearly all states, will not allow a student to qualify for "residency" if their primary purpose in coming to Arizona was to attend an Arizona college or university. In fact, Arizona presumes that any non-resident has come for exactly that reason, and the burden is on the applicant to demonstrate otherwise.<br>  <br>  Here's an example of how strict the Arizona residency rules are:<br>  <br>  "A person who is attending school full time, is employed only part time, does not file state taxes, is supported by out of state sources, or who is supported entirely by financial aid and student loans will be considered a student and not a resident for tuition purposes."<br>  <br>  Even if you WERE eventually able to qualify as an Arizona resident,  you must live in the state for at least 366 days prior to the first day of the semester for which you want to claim state residency.<br>  <br>  Moving in with your brother, nephew, or any other state resident does not make you an Arizona resident.<br>  <br>  So - scholarships - no problem. Tuition - muy problema!<br>  <br>  I hope that helps. Good luck!

AA10176626	Yes. Whether any of these apply to you will depend on what state you live in, and where you hope to apply to school.<br>  <br>  As one example, the State of Texas awards a one-year tuition scholarship to any Texas high school valedictorian who elects to attend a State University System school.<br>  <br>  At Tulane University, any Louisiana high school valedictorian receives an automatic $5000/year scholarship, renewable for all 4 years at the school, as long as the student maintains a 3.0 cumulative GPA at Tulane.<br>  <br>  Vermont waives tuition for all 4 years for Vermont high school valedictorians and salutatorians, as well. These students must also maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA in order to qualify for renewal each year.<br>  <br>  I think you're asking "are there any schools that will permanently reward a student for their high school grades, regardless of whether they find college too challenging, or they're not providing a quality effort?" - and I think the answer to that question is pretty self-evident.<br>  <br>  Colleges reward valedictorians for their demonstrated potential - if a student doesn't live up to that potential, they're not going to be eligible to maintain the scholarship. A valedictorian scholarship is not a congratulations prize.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry for the disappointing news. Good luck to you.

AA10212912	The quote claims that people are motivated to act (or not act) by their emotions despite the logical motivation their reason gives them. Let's say you are angry at someone and you want to hit them. If you reason that you might seriously injure them or you'll get in trouble is that enough to stop you from hitting the dude? Or is it your counter emotions that calm you down like the fear of seriously hurting someone despite the fact they deserve it or fear of getting in trouble? I just wrote a philosophy essay on how reason is a slave to the passions so if you want a quote and a non-literary support for the definition look up David Hume's A Treatise on Human Nature Book II, Part III, sec iii. It's online if you search for it.<br>  <br>  As for a book, I'd have to go with Othello. In Othello, pretty much everyone is motivated by emotion over reason. Even Iago, who understands reason the most, is motivated in all of his actions by his hatred for Othello. He cannot even give a reason for his emotion. At the end of the first scene he says that it could be because he's heard of a "rumour" that Othello slept with his wife but that doesn't even really matter that much to him. And if you need to get into another character Othello himself is driven to kill his wife out of jealousy and anger.|`|8juUgSK2aa	whoever said it is generalizing. ALL ?

jER0X5OPaa	I'm assuming that you have already checked that you would get a free ride to the college of your choice? Because if you haven't, I don't think a 31 would get you a free ride almost anywhere.<br>  <br>  But anyway, I suggest taking a class, if you can. I took one, and it was really helpful. I got a book and handouts, along with numerous practice tests that were former real tests. They gave me a lot of tips, like how a sharpened pencil is about 20 degrees (if I remember correctly), wear a watch to manage your time and set it to 12 so you can easily check the time, and a snack so you don't get hungry. We did practice problems that , again, came from former tests, and they gave us an approximate time "limit" on topics that had sections (like reading, for example). We took a test (not one whose score counted) at the end of the course, and I got a 29. I did a little bit of review for the real ACT, and got a 31. <br>  <br>  I haven't taken a class for the SAT, as I didn't take it, but I imagine it would be helpful the same way.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AaDsQi8daa	most likely, if you got 30 mins more you'd get a 1600. so, you have to increase your speed and accuracy. When doing math problems, im guessing you do it the old fashion way of doing the algebra and solving for the variable. Unfortunately this skill which is widely accepted in college is detrimental in the SAT, because the SAT problems are just not hard enough for that type of analysis (although we might think otherwise). So here is what you do:<br>  <br>  On math problems, set up the problem, and plug the possible choices in. This is the only method, where if you consistently do it, you get faster at it. For reading, DO NOT read the entire passage. Read the first paragraph, and the first sentence of the other paragraphs, to get an idea, that way you'll know where to look. The best test-takers are the ones who take the shortcuts, because you're not measuring your analytical skills, you're measuring how well you test.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	One of the best things you can do is to read more, and challenge your comprehension.  For example, if you read the news you can take news quizzes online every week and see if you understood what you were reading.  This will also help you in making sense of the test questions, which you've noticed are different each time you take the test.  For math you can get workbooks and just drill yourself.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

X6rFPI2laa	I think is was very competitive back in the 1960's, but a bit different.  There were fewer available seats for students -- a lot fewer community colleges, smaller state universities, etc. -- and the better schools could sit back and pick and choose.  One could not get into college without pretty good grades and test scores, and no respectable college ever had any "remedial" courses -- they expected college-level work and appropriate preparation before you walked in the door!  They also had not gone through "grade inflation", so a C was a perfectly respectable grade, and people were indeed flunked out of college.  There simply wasn't the current push to make everybody succeed no matter how poorly they do (or even if they don't show up for class!)  The attitude of many professors was (and still is in the better schools) that if one cannot communicate knowledge clearly and properly, one does not know it.  By "clearly and properly", that meant well-researched, properly organized, well-developed, and with excellent writing skills and perfect grammar. Writing major papers for almost every class was a given.    Now, there are thousands more seats for students, and many of the schools have "open admissions", so anybody can go so long as they have a high school diploma.  However, it is very competitive in that so many more students expect to go to college, so there are more students wanting admission than there are available places for them.  On the "high end", meaning the Ivy Leagues and other traditionally tough schools with excellent academic reputations, the competition seems to be about the same.|`|XJXsFn9paa	In the past fewer people were able to go college/university because of the financial requirements, and people were more likely to go for apprenticeships or straight into jobs.

b4ZDxiykaa	lafayette is a person he was a french guy who helped out in the american revolution <br>  <br>  Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de la Fayette (or Lafayette) (6 September 1757 – 20 May 1834) was a French military officer born in the province of Auvergne in south central France. Lafayette was a general in the American Revolutionary War and a leader of the Garde Nationale during the French Revolution.<br>  <br>  In the American Revolution, Lafayette served in the Continental Army under George Washington. Wounded during the Battle of Brandywine, he still managed to organize a successful retreat. He served with distinction in the Battle of Rhode Island. In the middle of the war, he returned to France to negotiate an increased French commitment. On his return, he blocked troops led by Cornwallis at Yorktown while the armies of Washington and Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau, prepared for battle against the British.<br>  <br>  In 1788 in France, Lafayette was called to the Assembly of Notables to respond to the fiscal crisis. Lafayette proposed a meeting of the French Estates-General, where representatives from the three traditional classes of French society—the clergy, the nobility and the commoners—met. He served as vice president of the resulting body and presented a draft of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Lafayette was appointed commander-in-chief of the French (Garde nationale) National Guard in response to violence leading up to the French Revolution. During the Revolution, Lafayette attempted to maintain order, for which he ultimately was persecuted by the Jacobins. In 1791, as the radical factions in the Revolution grew in power, Lafayette tried to flee to the United States through the Dutch Republic. He was captured by Austrians and served nearly five years in prison.<br>  <br>  Lafayette returned to France after Bonaparte freed him from an Austrian prison in 1797. Lafayette became a liberal member of the Chamber of Deputies in 1815, a position he held until death. In 1824, President James Monroe invited Lafayette to the United States as the "nation's guest"; during the trip, he would visit all of the then twenty-four states. For his contributions to the American Revolution, many cities and monuments throughout the United States bear his name, and he was the first person granted honorary United States citizenship. During France's July Revolution of 1830 Lafayette declined an offer to become the French dictator; instead he supported Louis-Philippe. Lafayette died on 20 May 1834, and is buried in Picpus Cemetery in Paris, under soil from Revolutionary War battlefield Bunker Hill.|`|fbd64694a498c73d8b0c3ca90c37602aaa	Lafayette was the French commander who came to the aid of the revolutionary forces during the War of Succession, you call it the War of Independence, from Great Britain.  Washington and Congress promised him that they would return the assistance when it was needed.  There was no US involvement during the French Revolution so when US troops finally arrived in France during WWI, this was their calling card.  (and you almost missed the call)

DjRCYuLXaa	I assume you've got the obvious ideas.  bad for the smokers, bad for the people breathing their smoke, bad for the country due to more smoking related illnesses being paid for by medicare/medicaid. Bad because cigarettes can cause fires.<br>  <br>  you could say that smoking inside and outside restaurants and shops repels health conscious consumers thus affecting the local economy. If I live between two towns and there is smoking in one of them and there isn't in the other, I'll go shopping/out to dinner in the place without smoking.  Thus stimulating the economy of the no smoking town and depressing the economy of the smoking town.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  A thesis statement would be something like this <br>  <br>  Many have argued that smoking should be banned in our town in public places for health related reasons; however I think this ban should be enacted for economic reasons including X, Y, and Z.<br>  <br>  where x y and z are opinions or facts like smoking drives away customers, smoking affects the health of workers who then need more insurance money or whatever|`|7Xgo1nYyaa	You mean arguments for the banning of smoking in public places??<br>  If yes, here's what I have::<br>  <br>  1.

DjRCYuLXaa	I don't have the specific book you have but here's my idea<br>  <br>  nuclear physics is the study of the nuclei of atoms and the ways we can harness energy from these nuclei.  First this helps us understand how the universe works.  Second, this created nuclear bombs, the most uncontrolled form of nuclear reactions- these are obviously bad.  third, once these nuclear reactions are controlled they can be contained and their energy can be powered to create electricity to power homes and industry.  This is better than coal or oil being burnt for power because it has no carbon emissions into the atmosphere.  These carbon emissions contribute to global warming.  Nuclear power is bad because the radioactive material they use is a limited resource.  It will eventually run out, but if the the waste from these nuclear reactions are contained nuclear energy may help us to bide time while we develop better wind and solar power technology without putting extra carbon in our atmosphere.  <br>  <br>  Please do not copy what I wrote word for word.

As a first grade teacher as well, I think you are going to have to narrow your focus as to what you specifically need to cover.|`|JO5Iphb8aa	Check out Spring Is Here by Cole Porter|`|331512b4169f8467fd51d17e965e5784aa	There are many things you could do with Spring. For example, counting activities can be done with painted eggs or little things you can make in class (keeping in mind the theme so that would be little bees and butterflies or flower shapes) or even seeds. You could also word math problems with spring things. For example, I saw 12 daffodils abloom in a row if I picked 3 how many would be left? <br>  <br>  Similarly students can grow plants or seeds in a small pot that you can label and keep in class for each child so they can see the process of growth. <br>  <br>  Going for nature trips and looking at flowers and seeds by opening them and exploring them, making nature mandalas.<br>  <br>  In your class, you could choose to paint your classroom with spring motifs or do a painting orwebsitesion where the children can decorate the class with their creations. You can also introduce spring poems and songs. <br>  <br>  There are many websites to help you with ideas you need or have and need to polish. Google for teachers resources spring season.
GiIFr1rjaa	When you both like running - 'I like running.'  'Me, too.'<br>  <br>  When neither of you likes running -'I don't like running.' 'Me neither'<br>  <br>  'Either' and 'neither' are used when there are two parties involved, and 'nor' is used for a third party. <br>  <br>  For example, 'Fred doesn't like running, neither does George, nor does Albert'.<br>  <br>  However, 'nor' is often used instead of 'neither', and to such an extent that it is considered acceptable, therefore you might hear 'Nor me' instead of 'Me neither'|`|r9epzkJVaa	You're right about your example, it should be me neither. Either means a choice like would you like salad or either soup, like either/or. The word too means "also".

I'm not sure about Biology Forensics and Marine Biology. I don't know the topics covered in those classes. Does your school offer any AP Science class? Like AP Biology or AP Chemistry? If there's one in either Biology or Chemistry, I would suggest that you take it.|`|c1uqy4akaa	human anatomy because ur dealing with kids so ur gonna have to know about the body/// and take sports n pe its a good class because it teaches u boutthe body|`|o2awQyclaa	You should take physics your junior year, then human anatomy your senior year.  In college you will have the options or even required to take some of courses above such as marine biology...taking earth science actually covers astronomy, geology, and meteorology in one class.  Most certainly you will be required to take human anatomy which is technically called Anatomy & Physiology.  You will take A&P I and A&P II.  They are tough classes and it would be extremely convenient for you to soak up your human anatomy class as much as possible

zMDAklBTaa	When Hamlet was just a student from Wittenberg, he honestly loved Ophelia and she loved him.   But then Hamlet erased himself from the book of his brain and wrote his father there, though he held "it not honesty to have it thus set down."  After that he was "from himself taken away."  He became instead the head of the body of Denmark, no longer free to "carve for himself."   Worse yet, if he married Ophelia he would make her "imperial jointress to this warlike state" (as Claudius had done to Gertrude).  She would become a "breeder of sinners,"  warlike kings such as Claudius and Hamlet's father, who was the "question of these wars."   So because he loved her too much to destroy her, he rejected her.<br>  <br>  Just as Hamlet had let his father usurp the sovereignty of his reason, Ophelia let her brother keep the key to her memory and let her father tell her what to think.<br>  <br>  To be true to themselves, Hamlet and Ophelia should have ignored those "tedious old men" and eloped to Wittenberg, leaving the whole rotten mess behind in Denmark.<br>  <br>  - Ray Eston Smith Jr|`|WKAqqYXEaa	Ophelia drowns herself<br>  <br>  My advice: Hanging would have been much quicker.|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Clearly, it wasn't great advice.

History (why he is famous - including impact), what about his ideas survive today and what about his ideas are challenged today.<br>  <br>  He is what is called a legacy thinker in that he presented some ideas that changed the way people thought about the human mind.

Hope that you can enjoy this website.|`|ayMYfxcfaa	If the fractions indicated have the same denominator, then that is the common denominator, and no further work is needed.<br>  <br>  If the denominators are not the same, then multiplying the denominators will give a common denominator.  If the integers in the denominators have no common factors, then their product is also the least common denominator.<br>  <br>  If one denominator is a multiple of the other, then the largest number is also the least common denominator.<br>  <br>  If the denominators have a common factor, then the least common denominator can be found by multiplying the denominators and then dividing the result by the greatest common factor.<br>  <br>  Some examples:<br>  <br>  Say you're trying to find the least common denominator of 1/2 and 1/4.  Since 4 is a multiple of 2, 4 will be the common denominator.<br>  <br>  Suppose you'd like a common denominator of 1/6 and 1/8.  If you don't need the least common denominator and just need A common denominator, then you can multiply 6 and 8 and you have 48 for *A* common denominator.<br>  <br>  If you'd like the *least* common denominator of 1/6 and 1/8, then 48 will not do.  Since 2 is a common factor of 6 and 8 (it also happens to be the greatest common factor), then we'll divide 48, the product of the denominators, by their greatest common factor 2.  Then, 48/2 = 24 is the least common denominator.|`|QwbOCHSTaa	Take the denominators they give you and, starting at 0, go up by that number until they both match.

Always make sure you change the numerator the same way if you have one. <br>  <br>  ex.) 6/9 = 2/3, because 3 goes into 9 three times and into 6 twice.|`|KvCD7wQMaa	Find the smallest number that is divisible by both denominators but not smaller than the largest denominator. <br>  <br>  Multiply both sides by what ever number will make the denominator = to that number and then reduce if possible.|`|XWvUQXrjaa	Since you didn't give an example, I'll make one up.<br>  18 & 24<br>  <br>  18=1x18, 2x9, 3x6<br>  24=1x24, 2x12, 3x8, 4x6<br>  <br>  The common denominators are: 1, 2, 3 & 6.

AA10176626	Jennifer:<br>  <br>  The best data to use when you're trying to research what it will cost to attend a particular school is the same data that the financial aid system uses. <br>  <br>  "Cost of Attendance" is an estimate of what it will cost the average student to attend this school - it includes tuition, school fees, books, room and board, and other miscellaneous education-related expenses, including gas money to get to school, and an allowance for a computer.<br>  <br>  The Cost of Attendance is different for students who live on-campus versus those who live off-campus, and there's also a difference between the cost of living off-campus with family, and living off-campus on your own. That's why most schools work with at least 3 "Cost of Attendance" estimates. SFSU assumes that students living on campus and students living off-campus on their own have approximately the same Cost of Attendance, so they only publish 2 separate estimates.<br>  <br>  For the current academic year (2008-2009), SFSU estimates that full-time dorm residents and off-campus on their own residents will pay approximately $21,196. Students living with mom and dad can expect an annual cost of $13,746.<br>  <br>  If you want to see that broken down by category (registration fees, room and board, books and supplies, personal expenses, transportation) - visit this page: <a href="http://www.sfsu.edu/~finaid/newcost.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfsu.edu/~finaid/newcost.html</a> at the SFSU financial aid website.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you answer your question. Good luck!

But another, and probably better, way to learn new words is not to simply try to memorize them.  Instead of simply trying to learn them by rote, write them down in several different sentences, and in different contexts.  That will actually impress them in your mind more firmly, because you will be forced to think about how to use them properly.|`|PXnn6LoPaa	When you're learning words for school, fold a paper or notecard in half, then in half again to create 4 sections.  On one section write the word, on another section write a sentence using the word, on another write the definition, and on the last one draw a picture to illustrate the word or the sentence you wrote with the word. The picture is very important because it helps you remember.  Look at all your cards when you're on the toilet to study them - then you're just making use of spare time!! hehe...<br>  <br>  To learn words for real life, or for the SAT test, you can go to freerice.com  It's vocabulary study, and every time you get a word right, the ads on the page pay to donate rice to hungry people!

pCQ6aCmoaa	I know how you're feeling!  I'm a sophomore this year in high school.<br>  <br>  My freshman year was not horrible, and our school is pretty big.  I suggest that you take a tour with your schedule from your first classroom to the next, and so on.  It really helps you prepare before the first day, when others will accidentally show up in the wrong classes and everything!<br>  <br>  I'm currently an all honors/AP/IB student, and I'll admit, it can be a LOT of work.  It really depends on your school, though.  Accelerated programs often go much more quickly and much more in-depth, which mean you'll have more work, of course!  For my freshman year, I took all honors/IB except for Art I, Orchestra, History, and Algebra II.  Freshman year was very smooth for me, and if you don't act like an idiot, many upper class will really be willing to help you out.  This year, I have no general classes except for Orchestra, and I have to say it's a bit much.  <br>  <br>  But only YOU can decide how much work you can handle.  Do you mind losing sleep over homework?  Will you have a bunch of extra curriculars?  How many hours are you willing to spend on schoolwork?  These are questions to think about when deciding on a school schedule, for sure.<br>  <br>  As for hanging out with friends, I don't really have much time. I normally hang with friends at extracurriculars or student events, but sometimes I get to go out and see them.<br>  <br>  For lunch periods, I cannot guarantee that you'll get the same lunch periods as other areas in the same grade.  In my school district, we have 6 lunch periods, the 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  Our times for lunch are different from surrounding schools, because we still go by the 1800s school system!  I'm sorry I can't help you with that!<br>  <br>  Some tips for being a cool freshman;;<br>  <br>  + Don't act like you own the school, because it makes upperclassmen angry<br>  + Don't act stupid, because people will think you're immature<br>  + Don't start or get into drama with other people<br>  + Do try to get to know your teachers and let them get to know you<br>  + Ask upperclassmen for help if you're confused, or ask a teacher if you don't understand a concept<br>  + Always remember that you can see you guidance counselor if you're having trouble with friends or with your schoolwork<br>  + Do try to do clubs, because they make high school super fun<br>  + Try your best, and have fun! <br>  <br>  I hope some of this helps! I wish you the best of luck! :]|`|7rp50tUBaa	Think about two things<br>  first the benefits of it. its only 2 years of high school and then you go 2 university which is a shortcut of 4.. instead of 4 years you make it in 2 years which is great. it might be stressful but think about people who did it...second  why could they do it and you can't do it? everything must be hard at the beginning but when you start getting good grades you will be super happy. Just study daily and ask questions when you don't understand and it will be fine. Nothing is impossible it just requires more work from you. Again think about the 2  years instead of 4 years and it also tells the top universities that your a great student.<br>  <br>  the official website says " The International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme is a challenging two-year curriculum, primarily aimed at students aged 16 to 19. It leads to a qualification that is widely recognized by the world’s leading universities" <br>  <br>  I think that summarizes what i told you.<br>  <br>  Again good luck and go for it.... Never let urself down and don't look at people who cry or pass out. they just don't work enough. Be patient and strong and you will do it. TRUST ME YOU WILL.<br>  <br>  I'm doing a bachelor degree in biology in order to get into medical school to be a doctor and its very hard but I just study and i'm getting A's.<br>  <br>  so good luck and never let anything let you down.|`|pk9JbCE8aa	From the sounds of things,you must have a lot of courage and intelligence. Give it all you have. we all get stressed. That's all the advice I can give you. I graduated about thirty five years ago.<br>                                  Roger S|`|wLOXyEVGaa	Hi! I'm currently a sophomore in high school. We don't have an IB program in my school but I do take AP classes. If you don't know anyone taking the IB program, it's okay because you'll meet people. That's what high school is all about. Make sure you join clubs because that is a good place to start if you want to be introduced to new people. I was nervous my freshman year, but you'll find out that high school can be a very fun experience and has more options than middle school. Success means hard work, you might not have as much time as you used to for hanging out with friends and if you don't you will still be able to see them. Whether during extracurriculars or before school starts in the morning. They might end up being in your lunch, but you can't guarantee that. You might have trouble finding your way around the school in the beginning ( I did (: ) but it gets easier and upperclassman can direct you. Most importantly just be yourself and you'll have no problem. High school can seem intimidating, but really it's not. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!

This is also described as speaking.<br>  <br>  what the statement of talk less say more is asking is : Say what you mean effectively without talking a load of waffle|`|qnL2JYihaa	Use less words and mean more.|`|AA10463356	Talk is more generally.  "We talked for hours."  "Everyone talks about the weather."   <br>  Say is more specific.  It often has to do with conveying information. "The directions say we should bake it for thirty minutes."  "The weather forecast says there will be a storm."  <br>  The expression you quote is most likely a request for someone to quit wasting words on unimportant trivia and get to the point.  This suggestion might be made to a politician who is in the habit of making long speeches that don't provide answers to questions.|`|21fysRQUaa	When you "say" something, in regards to quotes, it usually means what you are saying is important and means something, unlike talking which stands for useless conversations between people.<br>  <br>  i.e. Say- used when making a stand<br>       Talk- used as like talking to your friends about mindless gossip|`|OEATSehSaa	say something to someone,talk with someone

There is some ridiculous trend of having students simulate a "business company" and be "professional" by wasting money on ink and printers for some essays which the teacher probably rushes through when he/she tries to grade, and no one else ever sees. This is by far the most ignorant notion in primary education, almost as absurd as having children memorizing formulae, but not proving them in mathematics and physics.

But then when I'm studying for tests I get so frustrated. <br>  <br>  Also, use a ruler to underline headings and titles, it will make your entire note much neater just by doing that one simple thing. And from that, I have to say, ALWAYS put a heading, that way your note won't just be a mess of words and when you're studying for a test, it will be easier for you to find the info you need. Always, always, always, date your note. <br>  <br>  I must sound like some neat freak, but seriously, it helps. That way, if something falls out of your book or something, you'll be able to put it in the correct place and keep your book in order. <br>  <br>  Oh, another thing. <br>  If you have to take quick notes and they end up being messy....<br>  just come home and type it out.

Use different colored pens on your notes if you need to, and use rulers to make clean lines.<br>  Label your binders and have a locker shelf to make things more accessible in your locker. Also, carry a special folder home everyday with your homework in it. That way you won't need to carry your whole binder home every day, just the sheet of paper with your homework on it in all your subjects.

You can increase your grades by one full point if you just do this.  A little extra work, but well worth it!!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and hit those books!|`|AA10392637	The first thing I would do is take a fifteen minute break with some exercise and a snack.  Second sit down and work for one hour on your homework, then take a fifteen minute break with movement.  Then sit down and finish your homework.  Shut off your cell phone and do not text any of your friends.  Do not waste time on computers that does not have anything to do with your homework.|`|1LZdc4K5aa	Just think of how much fun you're going to have doing whatever you're planning on doing, and keep it in your mind that once you get the homework over with you'll get to do that thing.|`|eG7rb1Kbaa	Just do it knowing that you gotta do it sooner or later, so why not now?

Use every extra minute the teacher gives you to start homework--it really makes your load smaller. Another thing is give yourself a free day. Get to your homework first thing you get home from school every day except for...Wednesday. On that day you can start after Dinner. That kind of thing.<br>  <br>  If those dont work, think ahead. You'll have more time to do stuff you want if you just get it done, get it out of the way.|`|EJojZzONaa	I am wondering the same thing and i have actually asked a question on Yahoo Answers about it. I actually have a new strategy. <br>  Well the reason I don't start mine is because I open my laptop to get the homework off the internet and then get distracted completely. <br>  I think the easiest way to stop is simple. When you get home do the first couple things you have to do. Like for me its walk the dog and then grab a snack and DO NOT make stops after those things. Once I get my snack I go DIRECTLY to my bedroom to begin my homework. Now even with that you can still get distracted in the place you need to be. Like my laptop is in my room so I do still get distracted there. Thats where the next step comes in. I made a sign that says FOCUS and taped it next to the table where I do my homework so everytime i get distracted then I look up and I see FOCUS it reminds me I need to start my homework. The second you remember don't go back to what your doing IMMIDIATELY get your backpack out and pull out anything. just having a book out will be a good reminder that you have to work on it. Put away the distraction and then actually begin working on it. and there you go youve started. If your worried you wont see the FOCUS sign then make a few of them and put them in the places where you usually are when u become distracted! Hope this helped!|`|JVR8nwVkaa	Think about your future, know that not doing your homework will result in lower grades and that low grades are not fun. Also, that if you do it right when you get home, you'll have the rest of the evening to relax and not have to stress about doing your homework/not having done it.|`|xIdXHlMBaa	What I do when I did when had a lot of homework is split it up... like a soon as I got home I would've took out one part of my homework then fifteen minutes later another then after dinner another part, and I think you get the point.|`|W4PkDqMkaa	JSt prepare a study table to study on and the extra time play|`|GHd84xipaa	you need to do your homework while your mine is still clear and you are not so tired.once you get your homework done you can make time for other things that you enjoy doing.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	The average IQ for any age (IQ does not depend on age) is 100, with 68% of the population between 85 and 115, and 15% of the population between 116 and 130.  So on a real IQ test, 122 would be above average.  But internet IQ tests aren't real tests - you can't take a real IQ test online, no matter how much they charge you for it.  Online IQ tests aren't accurate - they don't agree with the real tests and tend to give everyone much higher scores than they'd get on a real one.  While only 15 people in 100 would get a score over 115 on a real test, more than 50 in 100 will score that high on an internet test.|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	Theoretically, the average is set at 100.<br>  Obviously, it's about potential not knowledge.|`|OvVgJTOWaa	the average iq for a 13 year old is 101, so yes, you are above average according to the iq test you took.|`|0LwWZALYaa	above dumass :)<br>  averge iq is 100 so yea

svhuID7oaa	Well in order to go to the 9th grade you would kinda have to have like a gifted mind or unless you can get all As in all of your classes and pretty much get As for everything else (tests, quizzess, benchmarks, etc.) because when i was in kindergarten i was really smart and i was going to skip the first grade but i live in California so theydon'tt skip grades there. But i was put in a special class for people who are really smart. and in the 6th grade (im currently in the 7th grade right now) i was put into a special class again because i was a lot smarter than average and i got all straight As in everything. So if Ohio allows you to skip grades if you're really smart then yea you could go to the 9th grade but it will be really hard to do it. but good luck anyways :)

Child prodigies show traits before the age of 10 and can often accomplish things beyond an adult level. <br>  Usually it is because a parent trains their child in a certain area like piano, painting, math, chess and so forth. Child prodigies are usually not well rounded and can only complete one or two things very well because that is what the parent has emphasized since birth. <br>  <br>  Overall intellect is more to do with IQ and smarts than child prodigies. Many child prodigies have a high IQ but someone does not need to have been a child prodigy to have a high IQ.<br>  <br>  At 16 you are administered an adult IQ test.|`|7rp50tUBaa	depends on how much talented your and on what field. but you could definitly be a child prodigy if your under 12 and can do adult level stuff. for example there is this kid who is at 4 years old who speaks 4 languages and can solve calculus problems.. he is a prodigy.

Taking music theory and lessons will definitely help you in terms of getting basics down in music you might not necessarily have (i play the viola, and i took music theory as a blow off class and was surprised at what I didn't know) and just showing an enthusiasm of the instrument goes a lot farther than what you may expect. <br>  <br>  If they have an after school program like a jazz ensemble or a jazz band as you had mentioned, join it. It looks good on resumes because its extracurricular. Join a local youth symphony, one not affiliated with your school system. It shows you're getting involved with the community. Plus, its a great place to make friends. When i was your age, i joined a youth symphony, and I'm so glad I did, some of the coolest people i've met were in that symphony.<br>  <br>  And most importantly, do well in all your subjects, not just in music. Schools, no matter if they specialize in music, math, art or whatever, look for students who are well rounded and are doing well in everything. Keep that GPA up and keep practicing, and you'll be on your way to Berklee in no time.<br>  <br>  Plus, you're a freshman! You're probably going to roll your eyes at me when i say this (i did when people told me) but don't concentrate on college right now. Concentrate on your music and your school.

At the university I work for we get lists of student's names from high schools across the country telling us who they think would do well at our school.  We show interest in these prospective students by sending them letters and pamphlets.  If you are receiving these, it doesn't guarantee that you will get in or even that you are likely to get it, but it does mean that the the school is at least a little interested in you.|`|hMSVmJN5aa	they don't|`|CgOs2ViPaa	i dont think it means very much for you because you are a sophmore. im a junior and im getting a whole bunch of letters but its like what you said. it's just asking you to sign up for their mailing list, or learn more info about the school.<br>  <br>  i think the letters actually start to mean something closer to college app time when they offer you free applications, scholarships, etc.

AATFdSItaa	Are you a student or a teacher? If either, pick something really interesting! For example, I did (Freshman) a power point on the Lost Lighthouse of Alexandria (the 7th of the 7 Wonders of the Ancient World) and it was so cool to learn about! It was even really funny! <br>  <br>  For example, the guy who designed the lighthouse wanted to carve his name in it, but the Pharoah was a total jerk and only wanted HIS name carved in it. So, the designer covered the limestone with plaster and carved the Pharoah's name in plaster. Thing is, in about 4 years, the plaster was worn away...and carved in the limestone was the designers name! Haha. I thought that was funny...<br>  <br>  Anyways, stuff like that! The Burmuda Triangle (Super weird. Tons of dissaperences and myths and stuff. Some of the interesting...some of them totall whack) Aushwitz (A famous Concentration Camp) Belize's Blue Hole (Google that, you get cool pictures) the Titanic.<br>  <br>  Get something that will keep kids attention!

Try to multiply 6 both sides. <br>  <br>  (6)(1/2)x = (5/6)(6)<br>  (6/2)x = (30/6)<br>  3x = 5<br>  <br>  Since we want the answer in the form x = _____, then the coefficient in front of x is 1. In other words, x = (1)x. <br>  Then, multiply 1/3 both sides. <br>  <br>  Note: 1/3 x 3 = 1<br>  <br>  (1/3) 3x = 5 (1/3)<br>  <br>  x = 5/3<br>  <br>  Answer : x = 5/3|`|ROPLbLW9aa	-1/2x = -5/6<br>  <br>  => -x = -5/3 (multiply both sides by 2)<br>  <br>  => x = 5/3|`|0502f99266db2b733545ca1f8f7b6571aa	-1/2 times x = -5/6<br>  <br>  Well, what would you multiply -1/2 to get -5/6?

7rp50tUBaa	that's easy.

D6yhCGdEaa	personally im 14 and think if most people below his age are playing it, then so should he. although halo can be quite violent so if he also becomes violent take it off him.|`|W4xJGKk2aa	he si 12 and still in grade 4? or are you trying to say that he thinks it is unfair because younger kids are allowed to play the game. if he has the grades, why not reward him. he is at a reasonable age for the game, those 4th graders arent. it is  violent, but so are a lot of other games out there, so as long as he is mature enough and wont go acting out at school, i think he should be fine with this game.|`|fAp0vFAHaa	First of all you shouldn't be a 4th grader at age 12 he already should realise that education is the primary key to success and that halo 1 is just something that relaxes your mind.|`|mrxmFDqXaa	personally i believe that children should be able to have their freedom when it comes to games but there should definitely be limits and he should still obey your wishes.  i know that its just a game but i've seen people take it WAY to far! i once seen a guy who was the most caring and compassionate guy i could ever ask for but a month into out relationship he really started playing halo 2 a lot and actually got violent with me when i interrupted his games. now I'm 21 years old and i don't play child games so i left his ***, but some people take it to that extent. i was told that halo 1 is not as crazy as halo 2 though. i would let him play it but if you think his attitude is getting out of hand, then i would definitely do something about it.|`|t0p1cSWgaa	First of all, I think it's fantastic that you are taking the time to research this and not just letting him play the game because he says others can. =)<br>  <br>  The matter of whether to let him play it depends entirely on your judgment and your son's maturity level. The first thing you should check when he wants to play a game is the games rating. For some reason I can't find the first Halo's rating online, but Halo 2 is rated M for Mature. You should also find out why the game has the rating it has, because some games that are M may be appropriate for your son and others might not. (Say for example you might be okay with blood in a game, but not language or nudity.) WhatTheyPlay.com is a site where you can easily look up information about a games rating and why it got that (that's what I used to find out about Halo 2's rating),<br>  <br>  So, basically, if you're okay with the type of things that your son might see or hear in the game, and you feel that he's mature enough to understand the important difference between shooting things in a game and real life violence, then let him play it. If not, perhaps offer to help him find a more appropriate game (maybe a T for teen rated one).|`|nNMEFXu8aa	Troll.<br>  <br>  4th graders are 9-10 years old. he would be in 7th grade if he was 12. and if he was 12 and in 4th grade you should have him doing more productive things than playing halo.

o3Jpfflgaa	I take it that you mean "spiritual warfare"?<br>  <br>  Spiritual warfare occurs between a saved person and the temptations of Satan.  (A saved person is one who has accepted Jesus Christ as personal Savior and is no longer spiritually 'lost').<br>  <br>  A saved person is attacked by Satan in special ways to keep them from living a Christian life.  The effects of spiritual warfare can be temptation to act like unsaved people do (curse, use bad language, commit fornication or adultery, steal, lie, cheat, etc.).  The Christian has to depend upon spiritual strength that comes by the Holy Spirit from God.  By resisting temptations, a saved person is said to be resisting spiritually.<br>  <br>  If that's not clear enough, you can email me for further explanation.

(It does sound like a rip-off)  Here's a site that has great tips and templates, and even though it might take you a few try's to get just the 'right' resume, I think you are capable of expressing yourself quite nicely.<br>  <a href="http://www.resumetemplates.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.resumetemplates.org/</a><br>  <br>  Have fun, and be patient with yourself!

Twitter allows people to send updates of up to 140 characters to their website, which can then be viewed by everyone who has subscribed to that person's updates. The updates are usually just about what the person is doing at a given time. These updates, called tweets, can be viewed via cell phone. (Making the updates is what's referred to as tweeting.) The main difference is that tweets go out to many people simultaneously and do not require a response, and also that they're generally specifically about what a person is doing.|`|ppSA86iXaa	Texting is amazinggg and u use phones 2 do it... and tweeting is for birds...

(I have no clue where the negative went, sorry).<br>  <br>  If you forget what the constant for energy change is, just remember that <br>  ??? (said constant) = (-) R * h * c<br>  <br>  So, symbolically,<br>  ΔE = (-) R * h * c / (n2^2 - n1^2)<br>  <br>  /* end equations */<br>  <br>  <br>  So it depends on what you want to find: change in energy or wavelength.<br>  <br>  Hopefully it helped.

heXiCKepaa	Your language and culture define your view of the world and how it works.  For example, in English, death is final; but in Spanish, death is temporary (Está muerto, not es muerto).  In your culture, your thoughts are limited by your language.  But if you are exposed to more than one language, and thus to more than one culture, your world is bigger, and you understand more just by virtue of your difference in the way you think, and are able to think.  You can ask yourself questions in Spanish, but you can wonder in English.  You can be an individual in English, but you can connect with your family in Spanish.  If we are indeed a mosaic instead of a melting pot, then we can profit from a bigger view of the world through the eyes of each piece of the mosaic.  We can be multi-visionaries, seeing the world in kaleidoscopic clarity and beauty.  Most countries do not share that opportunity.|`|zaZibcGkaa	well diversity gives different opinions on the same matter and it makes people see the world through someone elses eyes.|`|m1DuVX9Qaa	Diversity has benefited my life in many ways, for one I am able to make stereotypical jokes about people and know whether or not those people are present.

Je5ffMJnaa	St. Agnes is a fabulous school. I graduated in 2006, and I loved it. St. Agnes has a really good reputation not just in the Houston area, and all the administrators, teachers and counselors there are smart and fun and really dedicated. Girls from St. Agnes go to great colleges and have great careers. If you're worried about it being all-girls, don't be. It's a ton of fun, plus some classes are co-ed -- the boys at Strake are always right next door.<br>  <br>  Pope John XXIII is brand new and doesn't really have a reputation good or bad. I'm not even sure that they've had a graduating class yet. It is much smaller and way out of the city in Katy. Since it is smaller, their offerings in terms of athletics, extra-curriculars, etc. will be much less diverse than St. Agnes.<br>  <br>  Feel free to msg/email me with any questions. Good luck!
