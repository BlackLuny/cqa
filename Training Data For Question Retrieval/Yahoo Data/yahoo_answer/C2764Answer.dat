sqNsOIzkaa	OMG my sister told me about this. I'm not waiting in line for that psh. But I think going in a bit earlier and then waiting to order at 6 might be fine. HAHA they might not like it but you will =D You can ask just to be sure! But dannngggg I'm really not that patient and I rather get those hours of sleep =P|`|AA10852092	dont chance it dennys does not taste that good|`|e75df6a664af3ce172ac45f21fda2e44aa	IT WAS TODAY!

I have no clue. I am going to go check it out though.|`|9ebf820c904a11a9c97843b7d1308540aa	it doesnt say...i think its just better to get their between 6am (if you are going to go that early, get there at 6am) and 2pm cuz it didnt say if the time is staring from when they take your order or when you arrive.|`|gaXUIduMaa	I hate to tell you this but it was for today, not Wednesday.|`|aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	i'd think it would be when you ordered, so they could write it down on the ticket.. but i could be wrong    but i really don't think it's worth the $15, or whatever a grand slam costs..it's going to be packed..|`|wi0CSqNSaa	Sorry Im gunnna have to flag this question. I dont wanna have to stand in line tommorow. You are just making it worse!!
7HhWPKrAaa	you have to pay ten dollars just to get in. You still have to pay for drinks|`|PxJXJKCpaa	It means you pay 10 bucks to get in just to order drinks.  It also means that they probably have something fun going on inside that you pay to watch, like a live band or karaoke,|`|yfRVFBmwaa	It's either a cover charge for the band payed on entry or a fee charged to patrons who are not buying drinks from the bar. (eg. If you are not buying anything we will charge you $10 to be on the premises.)|`|llez7aU4aa	That means "leave". If bars are charging covers then they are just taking your money. Don't bother with them, there are plenty that don't have covers. Whenever we see that, we go somewhere else. Think about it, that $10 you could be spending on drinks. If you have a party of 7, thats 70 dollars in drinks!|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	A cover charge is an admission fee.    It also means you're in effect paying for the honour of being allowed in said establishment.|`|8IfePMa3aa	It's an entry fee, $10 to get in.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	$10 to get in the door...|`|VXcp8hvHaa	it means you are a dumba$$ if you pay to enter|`|AA10804824	$10 to get in the door. that's it. That does not get you a drink or food.|`|qJvMWlBUaa	it means it cost 10 dollars!!|`|w9Z9Haajaa	$10 cover is the price to get in. Like an admission to a sporting event or something.
PxJXJKCpaa	Since I read all the answers, I'll just give you "it depends".  If I was at my local mexican restaurant, it would be tortilla chips.  If it was at the mom and pop breakfast joint, it would be a bag of Lays chips.  If I was at a chain place like chili's, it would be french fries.  Some people now have gotten so bad as to call them "freedom"?  Or crisps?  A chip is a crunchy thing that comes out of a bag, but doesn't have to be just potato.  Doritos are chips, but they're made from tortillas.|`|yfRVFBmwaa	In australia or england chips are basically big fat fries.|`|qz8z8DC6aa	That depends on which county you're in. In the UK and South Africa  chips are french fries. In the States chips are either crisps or tortilla chips, the kind you make nachos with. Stupid question.|`|farhj0Kiaa	Either he wants to know if you want toritilla chips (like bread)or hes asking if you want change (coins)|`|AA11995175	usually it means  french, err excuse me "freedom" fries.|`|1e39e4ff5ad6a9ea20311bd72097c1aeaa	In the US he wants to know if you want potato chips...crisps.    In UK & Ireland he wants to know if you want french fries...potato strips deep fried.|`|Q6jOWIN2aa	Well, its talking about tortilla chips, like as an appetizer instead of bread. Its free.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	cow patties aka cow chips|`|bkOn30I1aa	Well i live in New Mexico (USA), so every single restaurant you go to will have chips and salsa. Chips are made out of corn tortilla, they fry the tortilla and then they serve it with spicy salsa. It is sorta of an apetizer.|`|AA11464317	In the US it would be potato chips or triangle shaped mexican style chips for dipping in salsa. In other countries chips refer to what the US calls french fries. As in fish and chips.
0sOnf2YQaa	If you want a romantic setting, you may want to look into some of the finer hotel restaurants and see if they serve breakfast.|`|hlYYjIyLaa	Hot Plate Bistro, 1205 Madison Avenue, 778-737-0870    Nice Cafe, 154 East 8th Avenue, 604-874-4024    My favorite one is:    Le Village Cafe, 3236 West Broadway, 6047309553|`|GnwwlYgNaa	Try the Granville Island Public Market.  You can go for a nice breakfast, and buy groceries to cook her a fancy dinner!
dCewrtXaaa	It isn't. Their sandwiches contain sugar- and chemical-cured meat, processed cheese, mayonnaise, a high amount of sodium, fat, and empty calories in the bread.|`|8j70Neqeaa	because jarred said it was|`|VppXJhCiaa	BREAD IS WEAT   MOSTLY VEGETABLES U NEED  & MEETS U NEED|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I think some of their food options are getting healthier. I haven't ordered anything from there in a long time.|`|pkjOPGRiaa	i work at subway we have different kinds of breads wheat is the healthy one veggies to go on your sub with that said your subway sandwich is what you make it to be remember 5 dollar 5 foot-longs come get one i got to get paid|`|eXaI4xnsaa	They make it sound all low fat but thats only if you get the low carb subs and if you compare it to like fried food of course its less but to me the bread tastes like paper and i would choose quiznos over subway any day    GOOD LUCK|`|edbc68b619100ee785d795f2749556b5aa	yeaa its not good for you.|`|vLD8L1P0aa	Subway is healthy because.....good qestion|`|69GgJhnWaa	It's not. Unless you get a sandwich with half the bread that contains only meat and vegetables. Since the sauces are all terrible and the cheese isn't terribly healthy either.|`|zkeu2ifyaa	They have low calorie, low fat subs.    It seems healthy.    I used to work at subway.  Whenever something, such as a loaf of bread,  would fall on the floor, our managers would make us put it back where it fell from.    It may be healthy, but it sure isn't clean.|`|p8YC9n2Raa	ONE ANSWER - it makes vegetables taste good :)|`|7dN1ANT4aa	lol its not particularly good for you. its certainly not as bad as mcdonalds or taco bell or wherever, but jared is certainly hiding some things.
WT0dGgoMaa	Most of the time yes. But at fast food restaurants you don't usually get to pick what area you will work in. And a lot of the time they cross-train their employees to learn several areas so they always have proper coverage. If each employee only knew one specific job area, and someone called off, they might be in big trouble. They would likely have you start one job, and learn it thoroughly, then continue to do the same and train you on others. Unless maybe you have horrible people skills, which might get you away from the register altogether.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Yup. They can pretty much teach you everything in about a day! ^-^ I used to work at Wendy's.  Easy.|`|pffEqA9aaa	Yes, it's a perfect type of job to get a little experience.|`|bnA0wUPRaa	yes|`|UwEEHuRcaa	Yes. My daughter started with them. They put you in the back to start with. They will teach you everything, don't worry.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	From what I remember when my daughter worked there, they train you on everything.  When you pass one thing, you go on to the next.  When she left there after 1.5 years, she was training to be management.    That was in 2008.|`|pueeMH6gaa	Yes, let's face it, you don't exactly need a graduate degree to flip a burger when the timer goes off.  My only advice, and you'll want to pay special attention to this, is don't for any reason whatsoever eat the food.  They hate it when you bring a bag lunch from home but it may save your life.|`|sux1aIHEaa	you do not need any experience to do that.   or work at a department store and just do backstock or floor.  super easy...  that's what i do and i'm in college|`|IVg9C8gMaa	Yes they will train you on how to do the grill, and how to make the sandwiches, and how to fry the chicken nuggets, it is pretty easy but the pay is not that good.  And there is a lot of cleaning to do.  I use to work at one, good luck if you like the food you also get a free meal, when you work.|`|BerN9ftvaa	Yes but it is not the easy work in the world.
ctE1mihuaa	Greatest sub ever includes. -- >  Sweet Onion Chicken Terryaki   On monetary cheddar.  With mayonnaise and chippolie sauce  & get green olives, green peppers, lettuce,  pickles and WHITE cheese & toasted    ps..pardon my spelling|`|HqtdnJvqaa	i used to work there and let me tell you the best sandwich i ever made was a steak and cheese with chipotle sauce. vegetables dont matter so much just put what you like. the sauce is what really makes a sandwich. after that try any cold meat (turkey, ham, or Beef or all 3) with red wine vinegrette. best sauce there but not all subways have it. another tip use honey oat for cold sandwiches and italian herbs and chees for hot ones. makes a big difference.|`|JfVxCDb7aa	try oil on it, it really improves the taste.   Meatball Marinara  BLT melt|`|HrDL4Njzaa	My all time favorite.. is probably considered a waste of money but...     Italian Herb and Cheese bread w/ extra Monterey Cheese, Lettuce, Mayo , and Salt and Pepper.     SOOOOO GOOOD!! Gawd I want one right now!!!|`|yTD84yFlaa	Chicken Bacon and Ranch; w/ Italian herbs & cheese.

But anyway, I like Turkey and Bacon toasted with light veggies.  I only worked there for 5 years, so I know that everyone has there own tastes preferences.    I like the meatballs, too.  But only if they're fresh.|`|nRAzraS7aa	I get the itailen herb and cheese chicken bacon ranch|`|7kF26l4jaa	sweet onion teritaki  tomatoes  lettuce  olives  onions  honeymustard  vinegar|`|jyTyHk3taa	try the tuna sub :D  the bestt    put mayo. mustard. cheese . avocado. lettuce and jalape?os  the best way to have it :D|`|c78mAitdaa	My fav, is Roast Beef... Italian Herbs and cheese. Try it with all the vegetables except for the pickles and olives. Barbecue Sauce and Salt and pepper.     Thats what i have everytime... I think i should try something new to! :)|`|cCUVwsMvaa	parmesan bread, mayo and honey mustard, turkey, american cheese, lettuce, tomato, salt and pepper on the tomato    it may sounds plain but its really refreshing
yRZuoyPXaa	Try Anabel's (or Annabel's?) along Tomas Morato St.  If you drive out from Roxas district, turn right and watch out for it.  It's quite dimly lit.|`|E4iUcYEjaa	Try going to http://www.yelp.com to find some the type of restaurant you're looking for.
f8a9aca43727414ea76f476de9c438a7aa	L'altro giorno mi sono sentita battere sulla spalla mentre ero intenta a guardare una vetrina...mi sono girata ed avevo davanti una coppia di ragazzi, che sorridenti mi dicevano: "Ciao, come stai?...Cosa fai in giro oggi, hai preso un giorno di ferie???"    Io, che non li riconoscevo affatto, stralunata, non capivo e in un lampo mille domande mi stavano frullando in testa: "...giorno di ferie io?...Negozio?...Ma chi sono questi due???"     Rinsavita dal primo stupore, ho esordito con un: "...Ma ci conosciamo???"    ...E loro: "...MA ANGELA!...COSA DICI?!!!...Non ci riconosci????    Rimasi nuovamente senza parole per qualche secondo, prima di illuminarli entrambi dicendo: "...Ragazzi, non mi chiamo Angela, non lavoro in un negozio ed  la prima volta che vi vedo!"    Loro a quel punto si sono ripresi e si sono guardati in faccia l'un l'altro...ero IDENTICA a quella fornaia che loro conocevano!

PxJXJKCpaa	There's one posted in the store.  Finding the streets just takes time.  I had a mapsco when I drove and copied it to make a book map for myself.  You have to know the whole delivery area before you make copies.  It's not always just county to county.    Keep cheese and peppers in your pocket, and keep extra cokes in your trunk.  That way, you don't have to go back for anything.  Also, keep pens in your car and a clip board would help but it's not required.    Worked for the Hut for 3 years.  Domino's for 1.5.  They both suck.|`|K2IID2yQaa	find out thier delivery area and google map the area, but they usually make it as easy as possible to find the place|`|AA12395227	just ask
oEYrC1Wsaa	You need to clean the tank out properly.  Place yr fish in a temp holding tank, empty the dirty tank, wash the gravel with plain water.  Refill yr tank with water that has been treated to remove chlorine, chloramines, ammonia, etc. (in other words ages the water for fishes safety).   Clean out the filter, check if all equipment is working correctly.   Get the water to the right temperature depending on whether cold or tropical fish are kept in the tank & replace the fish out of the temp holding tank.  You need to do regular water changes & don't over feed yr fish.|`|6RiLrsuBaa	get new tanks!|`|A4G03Bzbaa	I would do a 50%water change.|`|bK3QKhEfaa	Put your fish in a temp tank.
