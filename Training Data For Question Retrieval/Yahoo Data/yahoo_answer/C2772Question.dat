20090205115837AAKL2Fu	Dining Out;Fast Food	Why are most fast food meals unhealthy?	I'm not talking about specific ingredients or why people eat there, buy fatty foods, etc., but rather why are the options so limited?  There is no law of nature that says the faster the food the worse it is for you to eat.  What started the idea that fast food places MUST be all bad for you?  I don't see how speed and nutrition are directly connected.

I am thinking of going to a sit-down chinese restaurant (not some place like panda express; I'm talking about an authentic one where they seat you and it takes a while to make your food) tomorrow. If I go, I will have my backpack with me and I plan to be typing up some assignment on my laptop while I'm waiting for the food and possibly while I'm eating and maybe staying for a while after I'm done to type up some more stuff.      Would I look really weird doing this? Or do people sometimes come with their laptops in these kinds of restaurants?      Also, would they mind me staying after I'm done with my food to be on my laptop some more?      Thanks.

20090205153130AAv9YJD	Dining Out;Other - Dining Out	Can you use a few candles to cook a small item or provide small area of warmth.?	I roasted a hotdog over a candle and forgot about the wax fume and it tasted terrible!  I just need a candle and some reflective device over it that can heat small items.  I also know this provides a small pocket of warmth.   my second part of this question involves using a small amount of powered Tide Detergent or equivilant with water which creates a chemical reaction that produes heat, however I am uncertain of the best container to use to contain the heat source safely.  Any ideas would be useful. Thanks.
