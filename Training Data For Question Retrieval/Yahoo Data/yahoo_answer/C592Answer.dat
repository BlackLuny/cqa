Xhbg9F3Vaa	Omega-3 fatty acids are considered essential fatty acids, which means that they are essential to human health but cannot be manufactured by the body. For this reason, omega-3 fatty acids must be obtained from food. Omega-3 fatty acids can be found in fish and certain plant oils. It is important to maintain an appropriate balance of omega-3 and omega-6 (another essential fatty acid) in the diet as these two substances work together to promote health. They also help with circulation and lowering blood pressure. Those who eat a higher amount of Omega 3 have higher HDL (the good type of cholestrol and have less chances of heart diease and strokes. Other ways they help are with Diabetes, Weight Loss, Arthritis, Osteoporosis, Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Psychological Disorders, Cancer and Asthma. The benefits of having a high Omega 3 diet are plentiful.     Hope it helps and Good Luck.|`|3c92167902d211690da1f884b53087caaa	There's a long list of diseases that  Omega 3 is beneficial for. There is a ratio of O mega 3 to Omega 6  that is desirable and most people are above this ratio. While both are essential fatty acids (not manufactured by the body), Omega 9 is usually manufactured by the human body (non-essential but necessary).  Wikipedia has clear explanations for this.

UhIlIyLraa	I think a lot of girls like to brag and dramatize about how much it hurt and how much they bled...  like that proves how much of a virgin they were or something.    if you're hymens already broken it won't hurt at all, and believe it or not MOST girls hymens break before the first time they have sex. If your hymen hasn't torn yet, it'll probably just feel like getting pinched    if you're not sure if your hymen is broken yet or not, get a mirror and a flashlight and look, if it's there, you'll easily be able to see it. it looks like a piece of saran wrap|`|020c8b995f845d51e6a78d1ec529d405aa	For some people it doesn't hurt at all.  Losing your virginity and breaking the hymen are two different things by the way.  Losing your virginity means having a penis inserted into your vagina which does not hurt if you are well lubricated.  When your hymen tear you may have some discomfort but if it tears during sports you may not even realize that you tore it.|`|AA11885407	it depends on the penis size of your partner,, but i was ok when i did it ,,many many years ago|`|5b6a9fbe5d20c249d1c8b742f9a1d637aa	It doesn't necessarily hurt. You could have easily stretched your hymen before you have sex, which would minimilize pain. You could also have not been born with it. It also helps if you're relaxed, and turned on while you have sex to minimize any sort of discomfort. Also, one thing I might advise is to either play with a dildo or to have your partner finger you a few weeks before hand to get you used to the feeling.|`|vAWsbciRaa	It does hurt, but it's a different type of hurt.

Start off by estimating how many calories you burn each day using the calorie calculator http://straighthealth.com/pages/tools/ca...  This will give you an idea of how many calories to eat. Healthy weight loss is 1-2 pounds per week. To lose 1 pound per week you need to create a calorie deficit (burn more than you eat) of 500 calories per day. To lose 2 pounds a week, you have to double the deficit to 1000 calories per day. You can achieve this by eating less, exercising more or a combination of both.

There is a strong chance that if you are just starting to lose weight  you will drop more than 1 or 2 pounds the first couple of weeks.

GDzhNw48aa	Surprisingly, some women develop AFTER the age of 18. This isn't all that common, but it does happen.     Other than that, at 18 you probably are fully developed. I don't know if putting on any wait would help at all, it would probably put weight in places you wouldn't want it (and that has plenty of other medical problems if you go too far).     I wouldn't call yourself "underdeveloped". You just are what you are. If you're really concerned about it, you can talk to your Doctor.   And if it really bothers you too much - makes you very self-conscious - then maybe you can look into getting implants (if you're into that kind of thing). Low self-esteem from your body image can be very damaging.
IiQNfmhhaa	You need NO MORE than 1-1.5  grams times your lean body mass. The intensity of the workout and the rest you get will make the most difference. If you don't believe it try this - Eat 500 grams of protein per day for two weeks and don't work out then eat 50 grams of protein a day  and work out intensely for two weeks with plenty of rest. Compare your muscle size and strength gain for the two periods.  Massive amounts of protein are advocated mostly by the people who make protein supplements. Eat a good portions of white meat, fish, eggs and always drink at least a glass of milk (it is a complete protein) each day. You can take a little supplement to make sure you have enough of the 11 essential amino acids but don't go overboard. The difference between your friend and you could be genetic or steroids (not saying that he takes them - just a possibility). Steroids aren't worth the bad side effects. It's not just the tear down of muscle tissue- the recooperation is just as important. Try to vary your rest period between workouts. Forty-eight hours could be optimum for one person.  60 hours for another and 72 for another.|`|MYfBvPHFaa	Best way    eat carbs before working out then when done eat protien...doesnt have to be alot like a steak and some cheese would do it

Or if all else fails, promise yourself that you'll go to the gym 4-5 times a week for a few weeks.

dca1f4de5c2388534edd57f37c834671aa	Vanessa B    Let me tell you something not many people know,   When you try to wash the oil off your wash using soap or  any store brought product what happends is it sucks up alot of the natural oils  out of your skin, and what happends when that occurs? your  skin goes into over time trying to reblimish the lost oil  and doubles the amount, your pores open up more to get more of the oil out and air in so let me help you     Ah ok well my mother had the same problem as you,  and let me tell you what she did to make it stop,  this is a home treatment of course, the only thing   you may need to buy is a lemon if you dont already have some in the fridge,  what you want to do is get some lemon and squeez that   sucker into a tiny bit of honey, and mix that all together, put that   into the area where you want treated and wait 5-10 mins and than wash off,   the lemon works great as a toner and as we all know toners are   great for tighthing the skin and even better for your pores to look  smaller, the honey helps as an evener, it will even out the uneven  skin tone and also sooths the skin,This teachique not only destorys the pimples you already   have but it also helps prevent them from coming up again,Drinking alot of water  every day also helps alot :)  Well I hope this helps   -- Love Vanessa|`|f93300362ac3870e2649c95457c7ac54aa	sweetie, to get them to disappear overnight, you would probably need a hydrocortisone injection by a certified dermatologist. this is expensive and painful. i suggest you begin a skin care regimen and stick to it - fight the pimples before they come rather than panicking when they show up! you need to wash your face 2x a day, use a cleanser which contains either benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. if you have oily skin, invest in a packet of oil blotting matte wipes. for spot treatment of pesky pimples, use Neutrogena On the Spot Acne Treatment. its under $5 at most stores but its a tiny little bottle. it contains 2.5% benzoyl peroxide - works wonders for me and highly recommended on acne.org    so take some time to plan a regimen for your skin and I am sure you will have a clear complexion soon. preventative measures are key! dont pinch or touch the pimples!
ZMWOmrmGaa	depends upon how much you consumed and how heavy you are. The more important question is "what the heck are you doing that for?"     It will not make you happier in life. It just dumbs you down.     The fact that you had to ask shows that it is already causing you a problem.     Other than that, if you have had only a little, then drink lots and lots of liquids (cranberry, water and there maybe others), But again, why live this way? Also, yes, exercise and swet it out of you.    BTW: the tip about Ibuprofin ~ fawgetaboutit!!! knuckle head answer, that was....|`|bbeaf861d28ea30fc725eaf12634ff99aa	Probably not.

THC is stored in fatty tissues, so the more you smoke, the more you have stored in your system.

But I do love that you are trying. Well good luck!|`|1SoKpTM7aa	depends on how un-flat your stomach is now - if you're just "not skinny," then yes. However, if you're trying to loose, like, 20 pounds, it's probably going to take longer - you need to exercise for more than just the two weeks, though - if you keep exercising and eating healthy, your flattened stomach should remain with you throughout the summer|`|X1Walhkyaa	Those who think that running or walking will give him/her a flat tummy is mistaken.  The cardiovascular exercises just burn calories and carbs, resulting in weight loss (throughout the body).  If you want to flatten your stomach, do crunchies, sit-ups, or elevated sit-ups.  This will tone your stomach and muscle will replace fat.  Running on the treadmill is not as good as you think.  If you do these exercises, you won't start seeing results until week 4 or week 6.  Answering your question, running on the treadmill in combination with eating healthy will NOT produce a flat tummy in two weeks.

kLj1dvc8aa	You need to do cardio exercise to burn fat off of you...especially your belly. Try a kickboxing class or pilates. Walking really fast for an hour or so can help, but the results are not as quick. Any kind of cardio exercise that gets your heart rate up for more than 30 minutes a day will melt the fat right off. Combine the cardio with some toning exercises like crunches or leg lifts will take it off in no time. Also remember to eat light. Lots of fruit and veggies. It's important to burn more calories than you take in. Drink nothing but water. You'll have it off in no time!|`|668b26231f4368e260484d938cc2df9daa	Personally I think your just fine, for your age and hieght. If you want to lose some of it, i would just recomend excersize!

One of the best ways to prevent cancer, is to avoid its cause when it is known...and one of the bad habits incriminated in A LOT of cancers (lung, stomach, throat, cyst...) is smoking...do not smoke, and avoid the company of a smoker, and you'll decrease the risk of having many kinds of cancers!!|`|y6cCtuBCaa	all i know cancer is from the family genes

I hope I helped you out.|`|95357efc3ba8d7fb66c1e91e89a10e05aa	Just Walking.....    Helpful Tips for weight loss:    1)A good way to loose weight is to use a calorie counter watch    Keep to a 1,200 food intake    Add 1,200 plus 3,500 (equals one pound of fat) ...and that is the total amount of calories you need to burn each day. Its actually really easy once you start watching the numbers and it doesn't seem like work or exercise. Its just a matter of changing the way you think about loosing weight.    I use this method when i gain some pounds. The first time I did this I went from 168 to 127    2) Most people do not get enough water in their system. Water is your body's principal chemical component, comprising, on average, 60 percent of your weight. Every system in your body depends on water. For example, water flushes toxins out of vital organs, carries nutrients to your cells and provides a moist environment for ear, nose and throat tissues.    Lack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry out normal functions. To determine if you are getting enough water use this simple formula..  Take your weight, for example 150 pounds and divide by 2. Take your answer which is 75 lbs and change it to ounces, in this case 75 ounces. That is how many ounces of water you need a day. Your body performs mostly on water. If you make sure you get enough water everyday your body will perform at top notch and your body will no longer have the cravings of junk food. You will have a better performing body system to help you work out and feel better thru out your day.|`|nYIjl9nhaa	visit fitnessfun.page.tl they make workout plan just for you.|`|4qPLb4bNaa	become a member at a gym that costs 10 pounds|`|E1aQFbPuaa	jog, walk, or run to lose the weight. and lift weights to gain muslce|`|ENITsA1Caa	See site below to become thin and fit for life and cure your weight problem.

He says that is a good way to isolate the muscle that you want to work out. Also, when you are doing a set with your weights, on your next count when your weights are lowered to your sides/front don't relax your arms. Keep them up a bit and tense with the weight. If you don't have weights be creative. You can also make your pushups more intense by propping your feet on top of the couch and your arms on the floor. You probably just need more weight resistance.    I know I'm just a girl but my boyfriend has awesome arms and he really knows his stuff. Hope this help.

It was fun in the beginning. That is what gets ppl hooked. Once I was hooked my life just kept spiralling down.I had to be high all the time. Without it I would go into deep depression. I could not keep a job. I was not involved in my children's lives.I became a liar & a disgusting human being.Nothing was as important as the coke. Before I used I was very successful, a great mother,& was involved in church & community. The cocaine stole my soul & kept me a prisoner. I was heartless, angry,& empty. I fought off my incredible guilt by using more.  After treatment I worked one day at a time to put my life back together.I have been clean for 1 year. I will have to spend the rest of my life fighting the deppression & conquring the drug. I have many more years of clean time before I am the person I used to be. Most likely I will never be the same. My memory is still affected. I have no nasal passages. Part of my throat has also been eaten away. I am an addictions counsellor now. I am glad if I can save just one life with my experience. In the past 3 years all drugs have become incredibly addictive with just 1 time use. There is not a drug out there that is not laced or cut with meth. Even pot is being laced with meth or heroine. Drug dealers are bottom feeders. They are the scum of the earth. The path of destroyed lives they leave behind them sickening. They care only to make money. By adding  meth they have ensured a profitable future. Unfortunatly we are losing our future generation.  I have learned that drugs will destroy everything in its path|`|wLMTw0wXaa	Just say NO!

And for diet you just have to eat healthy ... 20% of cal from fat, 50% from carbs and 30% from protien. Get you carbs from fruits and veggies. Protien from eggs, chicken, fish, and turkey. And you want to get fat from foods like almonds and what not. You want to stay away from foods containing high saturated fat grams.|`|tGURYdsaaa	high carbohydrate concentrated foods will only temporarily reduce ur huner. instead of chips, eat nuts. instead of a bowl of raisins, eat a bowl of grapes- less caloriess gained and a fuller feeling.    use smaller plates. psychologically u will feel full.  make it a rule not to eat while watching tv as u will tend to overeat.    chew ur food and eat slowly. it takes a while for our stomach to tell our brain that we are full.    other thing is senasation satiety. ever wondered why people want to haeve a piece of chocolte, ice cream or cake after a huge meal? its because the body i.e. the taste buds crave all tastes protein, sweet, sour, etc. so eat a little of everything.    instead of having 3 big meals. eat 5-6 smaller meals.    ur metabolism will be revved up and u will be eating food instead of snacking.    never miss ur breakfast since ur body is in famine mode after being hungry for more than 9-10 hours the whole nmight.  ur meatabolism will go down and u will generally have a very heavy lunch.    when u crash diet,oover the course of a few days, it becomes psycholofgically overbearing and when u start eatig, u tend to gorge. this is why most crash dieters don't lose weight.    avoid artificial sweeteners and if u must splenda is the best. honey has natural bioflavonoids.  never ever use sweet n low ( saccharin).    a teaspoonful of cinnamon a day sprinkled on ur toast or cereal does wonders to reduce ur cholesterol and blood sugar.     chilli and peppers are scientifically proven to revv up ur metabolism that is help u lose weight. eat a little of them.    drink plenty of water. drink green tea.    salad dressings- some are very high in calories andd fats so be careful.    look out for serving size. on a bottle of gatorade, it will be written 60 calories. then when u read further u realize there are 2.5 servings per bottle. so be aware in this regard with all stuff.    lunges - one foot forward and bend that knee putting most ur weight onit. do a few reps. then do the same on the other leg.    squats - stand straight and then go down as if u were sitting on a chair. do as many as u can.    stepper - stepper is extremely effective( speaking from experience)    treadmill- put it on incline and do an uphll climb. gret for legs, butt.    aerobics- get some dvds or videos from ur local library. newer ones are better.     lie on ur stomach, lift one leg, bring it down. do it to the other. keep alternating.    walking and jogging are good too. try yoga and pilates too.|`|Hinj16nnaa	Nothing.

Aloe vera gel was found to help cure more than 250 skin disorders like: acne, blemishes, cuts, burns, rashes, poison ivy, itchiness, diabetes, arthrytis, muscle pain, skin disorders etc... It would be preferable to put aloe vera gel on at night because you are sleeping therefore you are not touching your acne leaving the aloe a chance to penetrate threw the skins natural moisture balance, the skin replenishes itself every 21-28 days put the aloe gel on your acne during the 21-28 days and in that many days it will look better, feel better, and be better, or just use clearsil..|`|ec8ccc41eb1ce32418bf89691490cf51aa	the aloe plant is better|`|c70fcc99c7b0091a9395aa305e399487aa	Aloe is for burns.

The pill basically  makes your body think it's pregnant, and works because you can't get pregnant while you're pregnant...   One of the symptoms of pregnancy is nausea, but there's also weight gain, emotional chaos, breast tenderness, sleep loss... lots of fun things!

Eating a lot of high GI foods can be detrimental to your health because it pushes your body to extremes. This is especially true if you are overweight and sedentary. Switching to eating mainly low GI carbs that slowly trickle glucose into your blood stream keeps your energy levels balanced and means you will feel fuller for longer between meals.  o Low GI diets help people lose and control weight   o Low GI diets increase the body's sensitivity to insulin   o Low GI carbs improve diabetes control   o Low GI carbs reduce the risk of heart disease   o Low GI carbs reduce blood cholesterol levels   o Low GI carbs can help you manage the symptoms of PCOS   o Low GI carbs reduce hunger and keep you fuller for longer   o Low GI carbs prolong physical endurance   o High GI carbs help re-fuel carbohydrate stores after exercise    Check out the following website:  www.marketamerica.com/newme   and look for this link: Transitionslifestyle   check out the eTools on the site, it has Meal Planner, Exercise Planner, Personal Progress Tracker ...  register with rep id: 4819843, distributor id: 524900107  or email: newme@unfranchise.com    Transitions is an extensive plan that covers everything you'll need to get fit and trim, not just a set of foods you can or cannot eat.

Then you can go back and think about what you could've had to drink (water, instead of soda). Start by cutting out the sweets, junk food, etc. Then start eating smaller portions, exercise. Maybe pick up a sport. It's a great way to meet people too. Check online for hiking clubs, walking events (like a fundraiser), ultimate frisbee, etc.

sMcMnsM0aa	Obtaining a 6-pack midsection is one of the hardest feets to accomplish.  This is easily seen by the enormous amounts of overweight people.  It can however be done with dedication and hard work.  Mixing cardio and weight training is key.  Lifting weights is necessary because as your muscles break down and begin to grow they burn twice the amount of calories as cardio does.  Diet is extremely important too.  Typically females need around an 1700 caloric intake a day.  Work on cutting calories and eliminate foods full of high fructose corn syrup like candy and pop a many juices.  Stay dedicated and you'll achieve it, look for results in about 3 weeks.|`|4f55d2ff9515ab32bf18556229a3228eaa	Focus on cardio.|`|AA11948498	Try having exercise everyday. Jog for 15 minutes everyday, or walk around for 30 min, eat healthy foods (vegetables and fruits), weight lift for 9 min, 3 reps of push ups, and 4 reps of sit ups. If you don't have any weights go to the nearest gym near you.|`|UOSWxPblaa	A LOT OF CARDIO BUT ALSO YOU NEED TO BURN MORE CALORIES THA YOUR DAILY INTAKE, BUT MOST IMPORTANT THE CALORIES THAT YOU NEED TO CONSUME ARE MORE IN PROTEIN AND NO IN CARBS WHICH IS STORED AS FAT ANYWAY, IS SO DIFFICULT TO GET THE 6 PACK GOING AND THEN TO KEEP IT YOUR BODY FAT % HAS TO BE IN THE LOW END OF THE RANGE GOOD LUCK , AND ONCE YOU ACHIEVE IT SHOW IT

cfff2d6ddb55b875c70e1b73621e7391aa	There is nothing clinically to use for a baby to stop teeth grinding.  If is during the day and it is a "teething child"  try a teething ring.  If they are older try giving them a Popsicle may be soothing.  If the grinding is at night time there really isn't much you can do other than repositioning their head to help alleviate the jaw position.|`|BzD6ziaoaa	It's probably a novelty.   It may mean that the child is bored, or hungry.  It could also be a remnant from when the child was nursing and he/she is still trying to go through the motions and hasn't realized yet that it accomplishes nothing.  This seems like the opposite extreme of a child who has become addicted to a pacifier, and loses teeth due to never taking it out.  I'd think that once a child gets used to eating solid food then he/she will realize how/when to chew and stop grinding.  Thankfully baby teeth are temporary so consequences from worn down teeth will not pass on to later in life.  If grinding continues for more than a few weeks after you try to communicate with the child I would take the child to the doctor/dentist.  Re: Previous answer  The joints in the neck are not related or connected to the jaw in any way, so a reallignment of the spinal column would do no good.  Also, I believe that orthodontists deal with the whole realm of jaw/teeth orientation.  A dentist would know if the grinding could cause serious damage based on how intensely and how often it was taking place|`|Bn6z889Oaa	Are they awake or asleep?  If they are awake and just doing it for fun, I'd bring on the distraction, chew toys, gum, suckers, etc etc.  If they are doing it in their sleep they probably have a jaw problem.  I'd visit a chiropractor, I don't know anyone else that actually fixes teeth grinding.  A dentist will just say, "wow, so they are grinding their teeth.  In a few years they'll have very sensitive teeth.  Probably a jaw problem."  A chiropractor will probably say, 'Hmm, her neck is out of place making her jaw line up poorly, this will probably help."  And then after one appointment you'll see pretty distinct improvement.|`|DHmrlvYvaa	get a mouth guard and make sure they don't swallow it.  talk to your dentist.

Symptoms you are in serious trouble include fast heart rate at rest, dizziness standing up, fainting, or shortness of breath as rest. If you have any of these, they warrant a visit to the ER.     Your doctor or ER physician will be able to diagnose the root cause and treat it appropriately, but the more pressing concern is your hemoglobin level, especially if this has happened multiple times.|`|bf678b1f588f69f8c289790238f0bbb0aa	are u on a bc.  are u overweight, call ur doc asap if this is as bad as u say thet may can  put u on something  if it continues an ablation is really popular if you are sure u don't want children... or a depo shot can decrease or even stop ur period... the iud bc is great for periods too but may have irr bleeding  its not normal so push ur doc for an answer and a cure

eZFdAsocaa	You need to take out your retainers to eat...so you don't get them all nasty from the food, etc.  Did the ortho give you a case to carry the retainers in?  Take those to school with you and put your retainers in there when you eat, so they don't get accidently thrown away.  I'm sure you've seen the 'joke' in TV and movies about that happening.  They are kind of expensive to replace.      I don't remember how long I talked funny after getting my retainer.  I don't think it was all that long (maybe a couple of days).      Really follow the dr's instructions on wearing your retainers.  You don't want to get neglectful now and your teeth move back later in life, if you know what I mean.  They aren't really that big of a hassle.  Just a little at first cause you have to wear them all the time, but eventually you will only have to wear them at night.  And don't worry about talking 'funny', I think most people will probably understand if you are talking a little funny.  If they give ya trouble, just snap them a dirty look! lol    Best of luck!!  Isn't it great to get the braces off?  woohoo!!|`|JVHr3DAEaa	um.. i use to have a retainer and i always talked funny but dont give up just practice talking?|`|MJoULhnHaa	i dont know never had one
IiQNfmhhaa	It's possible to lose 2 lbs a week in a healthy manner by adding exercise and eating properly.     Here are some facts:    1. There are 3500 calories in a pound of fat. If you burn 3500 more calories than you consume you will lose 1 lb.    2. The equation is: Fat lost=(Calories consumed - Calories burned) divided by 3500.    3. Females should not consume less than 1200 calories per day- males 1800. To consume less, will result in lowered metabolism and less calories burned.You will feel tired and lose weight at less than an optimum rate.    4. Muscle burns 98% of the calories you consume. The more muscle tissue you have,the more calories you will burn even while sitting or sleeping. Exercise will not only burn extra calories but will add muscle, turning your body into a fat burning machine.    5. Since muscle weighs more than fat, if you exercise regularly, don't use your weight alone as a measure of your success. Combine weighing with measurements, your appearance, and how your clothes fit, to get a better idea of how you're doing.    6. It will take 10-14 days for your body to change from using carbohydrates as the primary energy source, to using fat as the primary energy source. Limit your carbohydrate intake to 25-45 grams for 2 weeks. This will speed up the changes in your body chemistry required to convert your stored fat into blood sugar for energy. Don't go above 75- 100 grams thereafter.    7. Drink at least 64 oz. of water a day. This will help maintain the right chemistry in your body to convert the fat to energy.    I discuss this and more at http://www.looserdiary.blogspot.com     Go to http://www.mypyramid.gov to get information on proper food to eat.|`|xZ6CtnsIaa	To lose weight quickly and easily, change your bad lifestyle habits. It is undeniable that we will have both bad and good lifestyle habits. Drop those bad ones which have contributed to your weight gain all this time. For a start, you can start to eat more healthily.    This does not mean that you have to give up everything that you love to eat. This just means that you need to eat everything in moderations. Make sure that breakfast is your largest meal and contains the majority of your carbohydrates and fats for the day. Get those out of the way early so you have all day to use them. Lunch should be light like a salad or a sandwich, but avoid white bread and heavy sauces on your sandwich and stick with light salad dressings like balsamic vinaigrette. Dinner needs to be a portion of protein and a portion of vegetables. Sprinkle in 3-5 healthy snacks of fruit, veggies, natural yogurt, or nuts and you will be well on your way to the diet you need to become thin.    You won't be surprised to hear that you should exercise as well. Regular exercise is essential for successful weight loss. Exercise is about being PHYSICALLY FIT! It is not about expensive gym memberships, or equally expensive gym apparel or home gym equipment! Exercise is about PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, and enough of it to burn calories, improve your health, and keep you SLIM!

AA11802271	Let me start by saying I mean this well, with good intent.  Your workout is more than enough for anyone except perhaps performance athletes.   Unless you are in training for something and your coach is telling you different, you are fine. Maybe even a bit excessive?   This is a good question for your health teacher at school.   Too little body fat can hinder the growth of the reproductive system, among other systems.

It's important to get cardiovascular exercise but you should clarify with your doctor how much is appropriate based on your overall health.|`|8GtavzlKaa	It sounds fine really, but what you're doing sounds like toning - if you do the gym, you should go for frequent 1/2 hour visits instead and bust your butt in those sessions. Whist you're at the gym, do lots of cardio treadmilling (but if your knees hurt STOP), crosstrainer (ditto) and rowing is the best really because it does your legs and abs. Try and get around 200 calories burnt per 1/2 hour session. Do your current routine at home for "maintenance".
bX5cZk6Vaa	The morning is the best time, because that is when your body is starting up and needs fuel to get a good start.      The vitamins with be used up throughout the day.

I take mine with grapefruit juice when i can to aid in absorption.  Keep in mind that certain vitamins and minerals are toxic in large doses.  Do not overdose on supplements.  For example, if you ate a bowl of Total cereal (100% iron r.d.a.) in the a.m., wait a few hours before ingesting your iron-rich multivitamin.  This will give your body time to intake it.  Vitamin A is also toxic if overdosed.  Beta carotene, however, is supposedly safer so eat those carrots and yams.|`|b206cd3943f12e60c73648737c2f57e0aa	the TIME when you feel you need it lol

UlW8r13Laa	It's not healthy to "drop weight like mad". I think the max you are supposed to lost is 2-3lbs a week. Something like that. I would suggest toning up instead of worrying about weight. Self image is a better thing to have than losing 20lbs. Try doing some aerobic exercises. Schools usually offer intramural sports, or you can just go for a walk/run down the road if you don't have a treadmill. Listen to music, or take your dog, etc. etc. I have been experimenting with some things lately also, and I find that eating throughout the day (IE: 8am breakfast, snack at 10, lunch at 12, snack at 2, 4, dinner at 6, snack at 8) keeps your metabolism up. This way you don't eat huge meals either, but it won't leave you, and also wont make your body think that you are starving it. Because your body will burn less calories if it goes into that "storage" mode because you aren't eating. And starving yourself is unhealthy and wont help in the long run, and can even kill you. So that isn't a road that you want to go down. Good luck!|`|OHDXO5Dsaa	Not eating anything is not the way to lose weight...you have to eat healthy.  Eat smaller portions but more frequently throughout the day.  If your body is not used to eating then when you do eat, your body is going to store it as fat.  If you cant afford a gym membership then just go run around the block. Cardio is the best way to tone up and lose weight|`|pD5Skzdpaa	Why would anyone call you anorexic?, that's not extremely slim, that's just average bordering on above average.

I think that you have over 4 months to lose 10 to 20  , if you do it right you will be able to keep it off and look great. Just because the scale says that you are 140    doesn't mean that you look bad at all. Work at toning and then lose the weight.

If that number seems to overwhelming for you, then start small and make it a goal to make 5,000 steps everyday. Drink plenty of water as well. There are alot of benefits to brisk walking. So strap on your walking shoes and get moving! :)|`|IiQNfmhhaa	It depends. If you eat more it may not. If you combine the right nutrition and walk consistently almost every day of the week, you could lose 60 pounds in about 30 weeks in a healthy manner. If you are not already walking at least 2 miles in 30-32 minutes, build up to it. You will burn your body weight in calories if you do. EX.- If you weigh 200 , you'll burn 200 extra calories. After you lose some weight try to do more. Add some weight training if you can.    Here are some things to keep in mind:    1. There are 3500 calories in a pound of fat. If you burn 3500 calories than you consume you will lose 1 lb.    2. The equation is: Fat lost=(Calories consumed - Calories burned) divided by 3500.    3.

Doing this 5 days a week for 30-40 minutes (preferably 40 minutes) is what you need to start to lose weight. However, for proper and sustained weight loss, you need to add lifting moderately heavy weights for muscle groups all over your body at least twice a week.   This workout regimen along with eating healthy most of the time should help you lose weight. (Don't forget to eat enough protein each day. Protein is a major building block for muscle.)  Try not to lose weight too fast. Anything more than 2 pounds a week is not advisable. If you follow my advice you can lose safely lose about 4-8 pounds a month (assuming you are overweight).   This advice is from my personal experience and knowledge. Good luck.

Make sure you avoid taking iron with calcium, it won't get absorbed into your system right and it would be wasted.  As far as protein,  i'm not sure of the percentage but i'd say at least 50g/day would be a good amount.  Not to knock being a vegetarian, but you should consider some meats(fish is a big one), especially organic meats, they provide alot of other stuff your body needs that you can't get from plants.|`|fDh08Pd0aa	100% - That is what the percentages mean in this case.    If something has 50% of the daily recommended mineral or vitamin, you need to eat the equivalent of 2.
iyLgNf8aaa	El tratamiento de Ortodoncia se puede realizar de dos maneras segn el tipo de fuerzas que se apliquen, principalmente estn:    La tcnica fija mediante aparatologa fija que est compuesta de elementos adheridos a los dientes (bandas y brackets) a los que se les adhiere firmemente unos finos arcos elsticos de aleacin metlica(nquel-titanio) mediante un conjunto de ligaduras.    Los removibles, que permiten ser retirados de la boca por parte del paciente. Ello le permite quitrselos durante la higiene oral y en las comidas. Estos aparatos cuando tratan problemas dentales tienen sus indicaciones especficas que no suplen a la Ortodoncia fija, si bien solucionan algunas maloclusiones sencillas con un coste econmico inferior y menos molestias para los pacientes. En cambio suelen ser ampliamente empleados en Ortopedia de los maxilares con resultados muy diversos, pero siempre con mayor mbito que la ortodoncia multibrackets. Se utilizan sobre todo como tratamiento en denticin temporal (temprana o infantil), donde determinados estados patolgicos diagnosticados a tiempo pueden llegar a corregirse, hasta tal grado que el tratamiento en la denticin permanente sea muy especfico o incluso innecesario.|`|m722nsQLaa	quieres aprender odontologia por YR?|`|76Oya5Edaa	Ahh!

IiQNfmhhaa	If you get sick, do you wait until you get a little better before you go to the doctor? No! Then why get in a little better shape before you go to a gym. Muscle burns calories even while you're sleeping. You want to start building muscle all over your body so it will turn into a fat burning machine. Just start at a reasonable lever and start building up your intensity.     Are you concerned about the way you will look if you go to the gym too fat? Forget about it. Most people  there are too worried about how they look to pay that much attention to you. Go with the attitude that you want to start getting healthy and have a sense of well being-don't worry that much about how you look... that will come with time. I have a lot more respect for a guy at the gym with a pot belly working his tail off to get healthy than I do for some ripped guy walking around trying to get a glimpse of himself in the mirror every chance he gets.     You could lose 20 lbs in about 10 weeks if you eat right and work out regularly. One to 2 pounds a week is a healthy and doable rate. As far walking, work up to 2 miles in 32 - 34 minutes. You'll burn your weight in calories if you do.    I discuss this and more at http://www.looserdiary.blogspot.com     Get to the gym and good luck!|`|5916d067cde69ea4e90e8b8110efa311aa	The longer you put off going to the gym, the easier it will become.  I say JOIN NOW, and get in there and start doing small stuff that comes easy for you.  Grab your iPod, a bottle of water and a towel and go hit the treadmill for 20 minutes at a nice brisk pace. At least you'll be AT the gym.  Then when you're dropping the pounds you'll already be used to going.    Like someone smart once said (and no, it wasn't me...) if you wait until everything is right for you to hit the gym, you'll never go.  You just gotta get in there!    Go get 'em!!|`|SetA8df2aa	whatever feels comforable to you .  you don't necessarily have to lose weight before the gym,   just get your stamina up.   then join the gym   you will be able to make the best use out of it by then.   you can both tone, and excersize at the gym.    like i said, whatever you feel comfortable doing|`|WLl7Kht2aa	Do what works best for you.|`|ZbdL0pauaa	Well It's awesome to hear someone wanting to get back in the gym!  Here is what I would suggest. DON'T DIET    I wouldnt suggest dieting because DIETS DON"T WORK!!  They Screw Up Your Metabolism... So Don't try Dieting and I mean this just keep following me here. Your metabolism is the key!    Did you know that 97% of diets actually...      Damage Your Liver...     Harm Your Digestive System...     Dilapidate Your Energy Levels...       IT"S TRUE!!    So you might be asking... what's the secret? The secret has to do with your metabolism! You need a way to manipulate it. It's easier than you might think and once you start doing this you are going to love it! Youre going to want to tell everyone about it. I Promise you that!! Not only that, they will know it works when you show up and everyone sees what it has done for you!    I'm not kidding even though you probably don't believe me. With this little secret you will boost your metabolism, accelerate your digestive system and burn away the fat so you can get back to being the you that you want to be. Eating actually helps burn fat you just have to know what to eat and at the right times.     Hope that helps and if you want more information on how to manipulate your metabolism you can visit the link below.     Wish you best and good luck,    Robert

Or maybe you didnt hold it up exactly one meter, but instead minus or plus a centimeter or something.   Those are possible human errors you could have had.

I am sure you will last jsut as long or even longer in the future, do not worry  ok..|`|3Jd9dGJgaa	Yes. The more you do it, the more your body will last holding it in. Practice, practice, practice.

So yes, it will get better over time.  Don't sweat it, you are fine.  If you are worried about pleasing your partner and you happen to be heterosexual then I suggest going down on her first for 10 to 20 minutes.

The most Important part of this exercise is to try everyday if possible.

yl1ee8BVaa	Hey..you gotta look good in the bridesmaid's dress. Hopefully you'll find a great best man!!    To get down to the task. Ideally it is possible to lose upto 2 pounds per week in a healthy manner. So until Nov 10 - we could put your weight loss at 8-10 pounds.    Here's what you must do  Here's what you should do to lose your 10 pounds in a healthy manner.    1. Based on your age, figure out your daily maintenance level or your Basic Metabolic Rate-  you can do this easily online.    2. Your goal must be to aim for 500-750 (not more) calorie deficit each day through a combination of diet exercise. Dont go too low or your metabolism would slow down dramatically and thus limit your weight loss. Never go below 1200 cals.    3. Eat your breakfast. Research shows that breakfast eaters lose more weight than those who do not.    4. Eat 4 -5 meals spaced out at intervals of 3-4 hours each day. This keeps your metabolism chugging well throughout the day.    5. Once every week, do a high calorie or a high carb day. Give into your cravings, have that pizza slice. just to give your body a break from the dieting and help you to stay on the wagon. don't go overboard with this and dont ignore this as well. You should ideally have clean food, but giving in once a week wont be too bad as well.    6. Exercise is must.Cardio and Weight training - both forms of exercise must be included. Do you cardio with intervals. Preferably immediately after your weight training sessions. Get slightly more heavy weights if you want to really work out a home.    7. Focus of several compound and multijoint exercises - squats, deadlifts, lunges, bent over rows, shoulder presses, chest presses. These will work your larger muscle groups thus giving you a greater metabolic boost and burning more calories.    Stay committed and you will melt that fat away and look lovely in that bridesmaid dress.    Cheers!  |`|IiQNfmhhaa	There are 3500 calories in a pound of fat. To lose fat you have to burn more calories than you consume. If you want to lose 2 pounds a week you must burn 1000 more calories per day that you consume. Here's the equaution: Pounds of Fat lost=(Calories consumed - Calories burned)divided by 3500. If you work out this won't track exactly with the weight you see on the scales, because you will be gaining muscle which weighs more than fat. It will translate into smaller measurements however because fat has a higher volume than muscle. If you walk 2 miles a day in 34 minutes, you will burn your weight in extra calories. So if you weigh 135 you will burn 135 extra calories. That is equivalent to 2 slices of whole wheat bread.  I'm glad you are committed to keeping your calories at 1200. Any lower than that will be counter productive. Less would only cause your body to reduce it's metabolism and burn less calories for your effort. You'll just end up feeling tired and losing less weight than you would at an optimum level.  A healthy rate of loss is not more than 2-3 pounds per week max.     I discuss all of this at http://www.looserdiary.blogspot.com .

Salut|`|is9x38oLaa	J;ai lu ca aussi    On nous rabache a longueurs de journes que nous sommes en pnurie de sang alors je ne comprends pas pourquoi exclure une partie de la population.|`|MSPupP00aa	"personnellement, je pense", c'est exactement l'attitude que vous condamnez ici. "Personnellement, je pense que le sang des homosexuels est contamin, que c'est sale" ou que sais-je... alors hop! On les met  l'cart.    Je peux vous garantir qu'on ne contrindique pas une population juste sur un prjug. Selon les directives europennes, chaque recommandation doit tre fonde sur une ou plusieurs tudes dmontrant la pertinence de la contrindication. On doit donc pouvoir retrouver sur quels arguments cette dcision a t prise.  Il y a des gens qui "personnellement pensent" que le VIH n'existe pas. Pourquoi ne pas remettre cela en cause aussi?    Mais deux choses sont effectivement importantes  faire.  La premire est de vrifier la validit de ces arguments et de continuer  en vrifier la validit au cours du temps.  La deuxime est de vrifier s'il n'est pas possible de cibler mieux le groupe  risque plus lev.    Si on veut contrindiquer les parisiens, on peut carter tous les fran?ais. L'ide est ensuite de trouver un critre assez prcis pour ne cibler que la population rellement vise. Si dans cet exemple des critres plus prcis peuvent tre facilement trouvs, il n'en va pas de mme pour une cible aussi peu "visible" que les personnes  risque plus lev de transmission de MST. On n'a pas encore trouv, ou on ne s'en est pas encore donn la peine, de critre fiable et plus prcis pour cibler, parmi la population homosexuelle masculine, un sous groupe qui aurait seul un risque plus lev que la population gnrale d'tre porteur de MST.    Au-del de ces deux efforts souhaitables, on ne peux pas faire mieux. Les personnes ayant t potentiellement infectes par le prion sont contrindiques en masse, alors que la grande majorit sont parfaitement saines. Cette situation doit paraitre absurde  Dieu, s'il existe, car lui sait exactement qui est porteur ou non. Mais nous ne sommes que des hommes, avec des moyens de discrimination (au sens originel du terme, si vous le connaissez encore) limits entre les personnes  haut et bas risque transfusionnel. Personne ne s'est jamais plaint de la discrimination honteuse des personnes ayant sjourn au mauvais moment au Royaume-Uni. Pourquoi votre combat porte-t-il exclusivement sur la population homosexuelle si vous n'tes pas, justement, en train de faire de la discrimination positive envers cette population.     Je doute que vous ne trouviez beaucoup d'arguments ni pour dfendre la cause des porteurs potentiels du prion, ni pour expliquer en quoi la situation des homosexuels masculins est fondamentalement diffrente. La diffrence rside essentiellement dans le fait que cette dernire population est dj stigmatise, ce qui fait bondir  la moindre suspicion de discrimination, avant mme de savoir s'il s'agit bien de cela.    L'homosexualit en soi n'est pas un problme conceptuel pour les centres de transfusion. Vous ne trouverez jamais aucune question sur l'homosexualit fminine. Ce ne sont donc pas purement des considration de type: "ces gens sont anormaux" qui justifient cette contrindication.|`|KMzBexGtaa	Je n'arrive pas  croire qu'en l'an 2009, des gens pensent encore ainsi! C'est outrageant!  tre homosexuel n'a aucune relation avec le sang! Non mais srieusement!  Et puis comme tu viens de dire, il y' a plein de personnes htrosexuels qui sont sropositif !!! Il faut cesser cette discrimination-l, car c'est insens et blessants pour les gens!|`|mWvWNt8Jaa	Votre attitude ne me semble pas trs logique ou vous avez la mmoire courte.  Aprs l'affaire du sang contamin, la personne qui accepterait de prendre le sang d'un homosexuel encourrait 20 ans de prison si jamais quelqu'un attrapait le VIH ou l'hpatite C.  Je suis d'accord avec vous, c'est stupide, mais nous vivons dans un monde un peu stupide qui fait passer les cas particuliers avant l'intrt gnral.  Vous mme, si on vous disait qu'on va vous transfuser du sang de provenance indtermine, je ne suis pas s?r que vous soyez tout  fait rassure et en cas d'accident, ne porteriez-vous pas plainte ?|`|2CE0Bpcgaa	l'homosexualit n'est pas une maladie proprement dite mais une perversion du dsir sexuel.........donc sujet  risque.

Your metabolism slows down.|`|LnszYIkEaa	You should look at proper (healthy) diets and a good excercise program is "Billy's Boot Camp." I have lost 50 pounds on this excercise program WITH a proper (healthy) diet though those two combined equals a good weight reduction.    
NPy69FENaa	The healthiest way to lose weight is neither crash diets nor bursts of exercise. The body likes slow changes in terms of food and exercise.    For example, someone who has not exercised for years should not rush into running miles a day or pounding the treadmill. Not only will the struggle to do so leave you feeling disheartened and demotivated, you're also far more likely to injure yourself and set your fitness levels back further.    The same goes for people who suddenly start starving themselves. Diets that severely restrict calories or the types of food 'allowed' can lead you to be deficient in the nutrients and vitamins that your body needs.    So if you need to lose weight, what should you do?    Energy needs and weight loss    Your body uses food for energy. It stores any excess energy as fat. This means if you eat more food than your body needs for daily activities and cell maintenance, you will gain weight.    To lose weight, you need to get your body to use up these stores of fat. The most effective way to do this is to:      reduce the amount of calories you eat      increase your levels of activity.      This is why experts talk about weight loss in terms of diet and exercise.    Introduce changes gradually    Small changes can make a big difference. One extra biscuit a week can lead you to gain 5lb a year  cut that biscuit out of your diet and you'll lose the same amount.    You are also more likely to stick to, say, swapping full-fat milk for semi-skimmed or making time for breakfast each morning than a diet that sets rules for all foods.    You should think of weight loss in terms of permanently changing your eating habits. While weight-loss goals are usually set in term of weeks, the end game is to sustain these changes over months and years.    Increase your activity levels    Someone who increases the amount they exercise, but maintains the same diet and calorie intake, will almost certainly lose weight.    No matter if you hate gyms - even light exercise such as a short 20 minute walk will be beneficial if done most days of the week.    Every single time you exercise more than usual, you burn calories and fat.    There are lots of ways to increase the amount of activity you do. Team sports, racket sports, aerobics classes, running, walking, swimming and cycling will all improve your fitness levels.    Find something you enjoy that's easy for you to do in terms of location and cost. You are then more likely to build it into your routine and continue to exercise, despite inevitably missing the odd session through holidays, family commitments, etc.       Get out and about at the weekend. Leave your car on the drive and walk to the shops. Try to incorporate longer walks into outings to the park, coast or countryside and take a picnic so you are in control of what you are going to eat that day.      Every extra step you take helps. Always use the stairs instead of the lift, or get off the bus a stop before the usual one and walk the rest of the way.      Use commercial breaks between TV-programmes to stand up and do exercise, or consider using an exercise bicycle in the living room while watching your favourite programme.    If you are overweight, you can't continue with your current eating habits.    It's not possible to reduce body fat while eating lots of food, cakes and sweets. This doesn't mean you can never have any treats, but you need to learn how to limit these foods to small quantities - say, for special occasions.    In terms of weight-loss, you can get your body to use up existing stores of fat by eating less and making healthier choices.    This doesn't mean crash diet (anything less than 1500 calories), which usually ends up with you either getting weaker or giving up in desperation. Quick-fix diets can lead to a yo-yoing effect of drastic weight loss followed by weight gain, resulting in a vicious cycle.  There are no shortcuts to losing weight in a healthy and reasonable way.    Eating 300 to 500 calories less per day should lead to a loss of between one and two pounds per week. This is a realistic target. It may seem slow, but would add up to a weight loss of more than three stone in a year.    Fat contains the most amount of calories out of all the food types (protein, carbohydrates), so a good way to achieve this is to cut down on fatty foods and eat more wholegrain bread, fruit and vegetables.    Below are ways to reduce calorie intake without having to alter your diet significantly.      Replace fizzy drinks and fruit cordials with water.      Swap whole milk for semi-skimmed, or semi-skimmed for skimmed.      Eat less lunch than usual. For example, make your own sandwich and limit the use of margarine/butter and full-fat mayonnaise (store-bought sandwiches often contain both).      Stop taking sugar in tea and coffee.      Have smaller portions of the food you enjoy.      Avoid having a second helping at dinner.      Cut out unhealthy treats such as confectionary, sugary|`|hSOEgpPNaa	I know a girl who lost 190 pounds, and she did it fast with cardio everyday and a low carb diet.  You can do it too.

As long as nothing hurts, I wouldn't worry about it. Just be conscious about it, and if anything happens, see a doctor. But for the meantime, you should be fine.    If you have any other questions you could send me an email.  Or you could IM me on AIM, my screen name is sexyguy2127 .
S9UAiguFaa	Scratch all of that except for the cardio, cheerleading, and strength training.  A fast and dangerously low calorie diet is flat out BAD for anyone...let alone someone who is still growing.  All of the excercise you're planning alone is going to melt that weight off pretty quickly.  Eat sensibly....no less than 1200 calories a day and alternate cardio and strength training every other day.  Sensibly means lots of fruit, whole grains, veggies and lean meats...nuts etc.  I'd shoot for a weight loss goal of about 10 months if you're looking to permanantly lose instead of getting yourself forever in a pattern of yo yo dieting. Also, A goal of 127 might be a bit thin on a 5'8 frame.   Closer to 140 might be ideal for you.

All I did was turn my diet around and start using my gym pass. It doesn't take anything to start but the will to succeed. The very second you decide to turn your life around, act on it. Don't put it off ("I'll start tomorrow." "I'll go grocery shopping for healthy foods next week." "Blah blah, excuse, blah.").    Fitness is the one thing that you cannot fail at. If you keep at it for long enough, you can always reach your goals. That's why I keep at it. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Do your research into nutrition and workout programs and make it happen. You must be your own motivation.|`|L6K4WMO7aa	yes going in2 9th grade i weighed 150 pounds about 5'3 1/2.. all i did was eat good n excerise that summer i worked out everyday.. wheather i ran on the tredmill, did laps in the pool, bikerides everyday i did cardio for 40 mins at least eatin good, n hain small portions.. by the time i went into 10th i weighed 115 pounds n im still the same 113-115 n nowim a junior im 5'5 i excerise 6-7 days a week joined a gym n just continue to eat good. i can have wat i want but just make sure it a small portion size, n have a salad with it to fill me up. all i drink is water, n if i have coffe i do skim milk, n splendor.. i work out my legs one day n my abs n arms the next rotating.. each day i still do at least 40 mins of cardio, wen i do my abs/weights i use the tredmill.. n 4my butt day ido the stepmaster, n a bunch of other machines 10 min on each.. n i can see the diff!! good luck n hope this helpd|`|DIEvIsoUaa	I sure did.

Try eat more protein (red meat) as it helps for growth, and keep drinking the milk. Get at least 8 hours of sleep.    Have you also wondered about your background? (ethnicities) That may limit your growth, for example if you were Asian, you are likely to be small.
AekVyLneaa	As a previous answerer stated, nebulizers are intended for people who have lung disease/problems.  I don't believe that they would be any help to your allergies.  They do sell nasal sprays for allergies and inhaler (hand-held pump).  As another answerer said ..... nebulizers deliver medication to your lungs.... again this will not help with your allergies.  Just consult your Dr. and see what is the best route for you to take care of your allergies.|`|Mxq1NQJdaa	A nebulizer provides medication along with the humidified air.  Can consider a hand held inhaler which are effective in opening the airways.  The medication you may well be receiving with the nebulizer might be Albuterol which is also available in the measured dose inhaler (hand held inhaler).|`|IzHfbWtiaa	Nebulizers are more adequate as I have had one for several years due to C O P D >> CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE. and I use albuterol with it as prescribed.Check with your Dr.or a Lung Dr. > Pulmonologist |`|LzmiPeaeaa	My son has used a nebulizer for years to treat asthma.  It is for administrating inhaled medications.  Such as albuterol which is a bronchiol dialator.  If you are not needing these types of medications then I don't think you need a nebulizer.    I should add that nebulizer medication is available by prescription only.|`|vJPVmfbNaa	Nebulizers use medications that are nebulized....made into tiny particles that are small enough to reach your airways in your lungs.  The medications work by relaxing the smooth muscles that surround all you airways allowing them to open up.      So yes, a nebulizer is better than steam in that there is medication being delivered.

FaHuLB3Saa	To know if you are allergic you should apply some benzoyl peroxide either in the inside of your elbow or the inside of your wrist, then wait 24 to 48 hours. If you have any burning, blistering, itching, redness, rash and/or swelling stop using the product immediately and do not use it on your face.    It sounds like you had a mild allergic reaction to benzoyl peroxide (it's a strong drug). So you can either try to use the product less frequently (i.e. one application every 2-3 days), and if after that you are still itchy, then stop using it completely. I would recommend you stop using it completely, that being said, I know how bad people want to get rid of acne so it's really up to you.|`|nDxjnlN6aa	Sounds like your allegric. Or try using it less. Also try it for a few days and if it persists. Stop taking it because then your deffinetly allergic. Itching is a sign maybe it will become red or swollen test it for a while.

WhtjVvzUaa	I've keep my self fit. When I joined the gym I hired a personal trainer.     My trainer always told me; to loose weight or belly the only good way was to do a lots of cardio. Both Cycling and running.     I've seen my friends in gym have lost their belly by 60% to 80% in few months. All they do is cut down all the fats. Run and cycle 45mts to 1hr a day, do 2 sets of situps evey day (10 reps per set, increase to max of 50 reps gradually, then increase sets gradually) .    But say no to those sliming pills as evey pill has its own side effects. One of my friend lost his hair trying it. another had problem with her menses.     My advice running, cycling, situps and no fatty food. you'll see the difference in 2 weeks...    Good Luck with your workout...    cheers|`|4XQzATWbaa	Muscle is under fat, therefore to me (and many others) it makes sense to burn off as much fat, however you chose, before starting to do things like crunches.  Its also pointless expending all that energy into doing abdominal exercise if you can't see the defination under all the fat.    As the muscle is under fat, building the muscle now will bulk it up and push out the fat making you look bigger than before.|`|vtgVnCijaa	No No No.  That is not true at all; the key is diet diet and exercise.    You need to eat 5-6 small meals a day. Eat some protein with each meal! Cut out all refined sugar!!! Also add more fiber. The fiber and protein will fill you up, helping you to cut down on your unhealthy eating. Also by eating more than 3 meals spread out through the day you will kick your metabolism in high gear. Here is a general meal for a day:    Breakfast: 2 poached eggs  whole wheat toast  1/2 cup fruit    Snack: Cottage Cheese with veggie    Lunch: Turkey, lettuce, tomato, whole wheat bread sandwich  1/2 cup fruit    Snack: Protein Shake    Dinner: Turkey Burger ( no bun )  Side of brown rice  Side of Broc.          Then exercise regularly 4-5 days a week. Do both cardio and lifting. But on days that you do both. Do lifting before your cardio and you will maximize your fat burn. Cardio can be a sport: basketball, soccer, football, anything with losts of movement. Golf is a no no.    So Example :    Monday - 30 mins lifting then 1 hr cardio  Tuesday - 1 hour lifting  Wednesday - Rest  Thrusday - 30 mins lifting then 1 hr cardio  Friday - 1 hour lifting  Saturday - Rest  Sunday - 30 mins lifting then 1 hr cardio    For exercises check out:    http://www.xercisefactor.com    They have hundreds of exercise video clips    Also check out the XGen to randomly generate a workout routine. You have to sign up, but it is free.|`|vYmmw506aa	I dont think thats true. Try visiting the link mentioned below. You dont need to do all that nonsense to loose you tummy fat. Just select an appropriate weight loss program and stick to it. Results are guaranteed and are quick.|`|KuZ4Znmaaa	Hi there, this is a great question. My advice to you to is do both! Do your abdominal xcercises (crunches, sit ups, etc) to improve your core strength... this will help your posture and your ability to do many things (including running) in your day. Is also takes the strain off the muscles of the lower back.    To lose thin layers of fat (think of onion skins!) you need to have a negative energy balance. (lower calories going in, more calories being burned) Running is a great way to burn calories!    The end result is that you will slowly begin to lose fat, your weight will decrease and your tummy muscles (that you have been working on) will start to appear!    Good luck...

El VHP en la matrimonio es un tema delicado, en definitiva necesitas la orientacin de un doctor especialista para que sea aclaradas tus preguntas y tus dudas.     Seguramente ser necesario identificar que tipo de VHP esta en ti hay mas de 120 tipos y solo algunos de ellos estn relacionados con el cncer como el tipo 6 y el 18,  los mas importante para evitar desarrollo de cncer es una revisin peridica y oportuna si como llevar una vida muy saludable ya que cuando tus defensas disminuyen existe riesgo de desarrollo y propagacin del virus; yo mismo sufr una baja en mis defensas por estrs y depresin y fue el momento en que se desarrollo papiloma plano sobre la superficie de mi piel as que recib un tratamiento de criogenizacin.   Ahora bien  tambin pens en lo que suceder cuando me case y la orientacin que me dieron es que si mantienes relaciones sin preservativo los dos estn en un recontagio constante y el tipo de VHP que tengan si llega a desarrollarse puede volverse muy resistente a los antibiticos para controlarlo, por tanto hay que mantener las defensas altas y revisiones frecuentes, si piensan tener hijos lo mas recomendable es como ya te han dicho por cesrea.

Vamos por parte, lo primero es pensar en ti por lo tanto debes recibir apoyo sicologico para aceptar e insertar esta nueva etapa en tu vida,  ya que el que se hayan reducido tus encuentros sexuales es por algo netamente psicologico  tu novio de alguna  forma debe sentirse culpable y es normal que por tu parte sientas miedo a empeorar tu salud y aun peor, a morir (ahora lo pienso y la verdad es que uno exagera) , creo que seria importante si estan pensando en casarse,  primero tratarse sicologicamente (sea en conjunto o individual) para comenzar una nueva vida sin culpas por su parte y sin rencores por la tuya.  Ahora la que debe decidir si es conveniente o no casarse con l eres t y creo que es importante que se sincere y te diga hace cuanto se contagio si estando contigo o no y si fue estando contigo y se aman, perdonense y de aqui en adelante 100% honestidad y fidelidad.   En segundo lugar tu caso no se agravara por tener relaciones sexuales con tu novio por que el virus ya lo tienes aunque es importante que ustedes como pareja sean tratados con algun medicamento(consulta con tu ginecologo) ...y los hijos vendran igual solo que tu ginecologo te indicara cual sera el mejor momento....por lo tanto vete con calma, aprende sobre el tema toma las riendas de la situacion ya que es a ti a quien afecta directamente y educa a tu novio al respecto ya que para los hombres es algo casi de otro planeta...y lo mas importante en los casos de ETS es la fidelidad de lo contrario que cada uno siga su rumbo.

FyCUBdAAaa	It's OK to masturbate even when you have a partner right there - he'll probably think it's really hot seeing you get turned on. And, if you do it using his hand, that will get him involved and will show him just what you like. Or, if he puts his hand over yours while you do it, that will show him too.    Masturbating during intercourse can give you stimulation that might be hard to get otherwise. It might be easier for you to play with yourself than for him to, depending on the angles involved.     Any guy who really like you will want you to be happy, and want to know how to make you happy. Since he doesn't have a female body of his own to practice on, any help you can give him is likely to be appreciated.|`|d8fG3NUdaa	Oh yes, same with me.  I can easily orgasm while masturbating (especially when thinking of American Idol David Cook; he's so hot).  But whenever I'm having sex, it's another ball game.  With the guys that I dated, I only had one orgasm out of the all the times we did it and we did it alot too; so that's pretty sad.  This situation is very common and the good news is that it's mainly psychological, not physical.  You just have to communicate with your partner and tell him what feels good to you.  Give him directions; show him how you pleasure yourself.  It could also be stress and being too focused and worried about rather or not you'll get there.  Sex is about enjoying the present moment and sharing the love with your partner; it's not about competing and getting first to the finish line.  If you can remember this, you'll enjoy yourself alot more and orgasm when you least expect it.  Good luck.|`|5cJrnaQaaa	I have the same problem..  He always feels like he's letting me down, and I don't know how I can make it possible for him to do it either.

Or buy one from http://www.adameve.com and some clit sensitizer cream. Its suppose to be really great! Anyway I hope I helped. BTW I can not O with out clit stimulation.  Its natural for some women.|`|PgrKQL7Baa	It is only mentally, when u can reach orgasm with masturbating, u must reach it otherwise, Ok, I have one thg to say, what do u do while masturbating, playing with ur clit, rubbing ur vulva, ask ur man to do same when foreplay is done, u will get fully lubricate, then u will reach orgasm, it is all in ur mind, come on baby, u must think positive, dont blame the guys.....|`|W0kzdEtVaa	When a girl has an orgasm it not like any reaction you just have, an orgasm has to be premeditated you have to be relaxed or just extreamly horny, but it takes the comfort and relaxation to give you that extra peak you need to exlpode all over on the inside, you can have the best sex ever and not have an orgasm, if your stressed out from work it could cause you not to have one , tensed up? Won't have one, Their are so many things that can stop you from having one.Thats why you should work yourself up  some before masterbating think about it have daydreams. I really hope this helps and yes i know im a guy. But i do read cosmo no im not gay, i love pleasing my girl  and ill do anything for her.

U9VuWoZ1aa	If you really don't wanna do it then tell him. If u do but your just scared of the pain tell him you'll try it but let him wear a condom to prevent a mess and use lubrication to make it more pleasant. But if I were U I wouldn't do it simple fact it's for "exit only". Did you know anal sex can result in incontinence especially when u get older because it wasn't meant for sex. Your sphincter (muscle in the anus) will get stretched out. Like u cant hold your poo or your diarrhea, it will just come out or leak.  U cant even hold your fart. I don't mean to be nasty but I just wanted u to know before u do it.

You simply need to tell him it hurts too much    But know that it doesn't always hurt, nor does it have to *at all* if you do it right. If it hurts you're doing it wrong!     It can be very pleasurable for both partners.  You want to make yourself comfortable, so be clean, and relaxed, do not tighten.  Start small- fingers, etc.. and use plenty of lube, too much, in fact.  Do not use numbing lube you might not feel it if he hurts you which can have bad consequences.  Take it really slow and YOU do the pushing, not him- at least at first.  If he wants to have Anal sex then you have to agree and you have to be in charge- its your body after all.|`|4NlT9WM5aa	If you can't handle the pain thats because your anus can't handle     it. Why, because its not made to have things put in it. so thats normal  that it hurts but if you want to do it then go for it. It can cause tearing down there which will stink really bad. suggestions make sure he has lubricant, condom would be better than no condom because it slides better. Another thing MAKE SURE HE GOES SLOW, You tell him when to push some more. Good Luck and have fun|`|9uDXMufXaa	Here's my take on this. I think sex is about both partners comfort level. It is more about consideration of the other. Never should either partner "push" the other into doing something that causes pain or discomfort. It's just selfish and there are too many other forms of sex and sex play you guys can do to spice up the bedroom. As long as it's something you BOTH want to do.
TSX6kTfraa	I think you're on the right track. As long as your consuming lots of protein to build the muscle. 150-400 sit ups a day should do the trick pretty efficiently.|`|CwTXgy1Faa	here this is what i used and it worked     http://youtube.com/watch?v=4YRB1ISbKTQ    im turning 15 in october, i wiegh 90 pounds and im 4"11|`|6cmvZ6BNaa	I think it's a bad idea to build a lot of muscles when you are still growing. But all I can suggest is do a lot of crunches everyday, every type possible. Not just plain crunches. Do ab work outs for 30-40 minutes everyday. Also run. I would say work out 2 hours a day.
IHJNyAHyaa	No you're not obese, but according to your boby mass index, your BMI, you are overweight.  I would say a good weight according to your height is about 115-125 lbs. But there are limits to the BMI calculator because it may overestimate body fat in athletes and others who have a muscular build. Go to this website. It has a lot of good info including how to control your weight.     http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/bmicalc....    Losing weight is not easy and definately must be a lifestyle change, and something you stick with if you want lasting results. Don't just look at it as losing weight though, look at it as being healthy. And set small, attainable goals, not unreachable goals because you will only get frustrated and possibly quit leaving you at square one! Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|AA10049454	hey, repetition is key. if your gonna start jumping rope (great for muscle tone and cardio) than jump rope twice daily and keep a good routine. do jump rope like monday and wednes. then mix it up with crunch/curls or jumping jacks. anything to get blood pumping thru your body! it doesn't sound like your morbidly obese, but maybe changing your lifestyle a little will help knock a few extra pounds off.|`|I8pdXAezaa	cardio.|`|BCjwhtqkaa	Your BMI says your 28.5 which is overweight, 30 is obese.

If you don't eat  wheat  then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey cakes, you don't  eat  junk  food,  and  you don't eat biscuits. But your diet is still  balanced. It costs nothing, and you do not have to calculate points or to buy special meals or plans.|`|AA11161590	I have lost 54 pounds Since May 1st. I am with a nutrionist and a weight management doctor. Diet and exercise is the best way. I am being monitored on a Meal replacement diet, and only taking in 1000 calories a day, but still getting all the vitamins and minerals that I need. IT i extremely HARD though because you cannot eat ANYTHING else but what they give you, but it works and they monitor your health. Best way to know if you are obese, is go to your doctor and get them to refer you to a nutritionist.|`|ZFNfqn6Laa	Any cardio is an awesome way to lose weight. Check Your basal metabolic rate (google search for the calculator.) Then consume close to that to speed up loss then just reduce by a hundred or so. Running is awesome and burns a lot of calories. If you excersize right when you get up on and empty stomach it burns more fat and jump starts your metabolism. If you put on some muscle then you burn more calories naturally so doing lifting would be awesome. Workout only certian muscle groups at a time and allow 72 hours between them. Ex. Abs and back on monday then again on thursday. Arms and legs on Tuesday Friday.. Longer endurance muscles are built with low weight high reps. Try to shoot for at least 30 min of cardio per day 5-6 days a week. Even if it is just walking. You can slowly mix in some joging intervals and before you know it you will be running a few miles at a time and it will be a lifestyle change and if you keep going at the same pace you will plateau so you need to speed up or lengthen workout every 2-3 weeks. Try to keep in shape because it really sucks getting back to where you were. Also, try to increase protein and fiber and decrease fat. Skip soda even if diet. and reduce dairy or try the low fat options. Any little change can have a major effecton your body and you'll get used to the taste. Limit the junkfood don't go cold turkey. Eventually you might be able to cut it out but work up to it. I eat kashi products they are really healthy and full of protein and fiber. Fruits and veggies are a must and don't drink calories. You can go to farmers markets to get them cheaper than the grocery store. Make sure you drink enough water.  Doing it with friends it an easy way to keep on track and sports are a good way to stay commited.|`|f87e7fa9aa783054d9bf8b2721b237beaa	Girl, you are just like me, but weigh less. I am 5 feet 1/2 inch and weigh about 180. I had two kids and have to watch what i eat and in what amounts. And yes, exercise is the key. Your age is also a big factor as well. I am 28 and the older you get the harder it is to lose weight. If you are still young like me, it won't be so hard. If you don't have kids to weigh you down, try joining an exercise group or a nutrition program. you will meet new people as you lose weight together!

ad9AssJZaa	 Definitley! Go for it, they are great. I have the copper one because I HATE hormones. Anyway, it may hurt you a little more during the insertion if you have never had a baby, but it doesn't take very long. I have had a baby AND I took a vicodin before I went in to have it inserted and it was still pretty uncomfortable but not very painful. I go to and went to this website a lot before I got mine and it helped me make my decision, but I would say a lot of women on this site have an IUD when they have never had a child, here is thie link, it is really greeat.http://community.livejournal.com/iud_div...

The birth control helped, but I was still pretty heavy, I told everyone and there like what are you serious, this just aint right.. ANd so I went back to the doctor... They just kept me on birth control, and told me to take Motrin while bleeding, and it may slow down. With the anemia. I have anemia because I had gastric bypass and I cant get the right nutrition. Bleeding heavy is not helping this matter. My doctor put me on a birth control that has iron supplement in it. It seems like it is called Yazemine.

IiQNfmhhaa	First of all God bless you and your husband for the sacrifices you are making for our country.    You need to combine healthy nutrition with your exercise to get the most success. Go to http://www.mypyramid.gov to find out how to eat to lose weight. It is free. Well, paid for by your tax dollars. Nothing from the Government is free.    To lose weight in a healthy and sustainable way you should not lose more than 1-3 pounds per week. The more overweight you are the more you will lose in the beginning but 2 pounds a week is a realistic pace. Walking 2 miles in 34 minutes on a flat surface, will burn approximately your weight in extra calories. If you walk on an incline you will burn more. In 2 months, it is realistic to expect that you can lose 16 pounds of FAT, but not necessarily that much weight. Read below for an explanation.      Here are some facts:    1. There are 3500 calories in a pound of fat. If you burn 3500 calories than you consume you will lose 1 lb.    2. The equation is: Fat lost=(Calories consumed - Calories burned) divided by 3500.    3. Females should not consume less than 1200 calories per day- males 1800. To consume less will result in lowered metabolism and less calories burned.You will feel tired and lose weight at less than an optimum rate.    4. Muscle burns 98% of the calories you consume. The more muscles the more calories you will burn even while sitting or sleeping. Exercise will not only burn extra calories but add muscles, turning your body into a fat burning machine.    5. Since muscle weighs more than fat, if you exercise regularly don't use your weight as a measure of your success. Combine weighing with measurements, your appearance, and how your clothes fit to get a better idea of how you're doing.     6. It will take a 10-14 days for your body to change from using carbohydrates as the primary energy source, to using fat as the primary source. Limit your carbohydrate intake to 35-50 grams for 2 weeks. This will speed up the changes in your body chemistry reguired to convert your stored fat into blood sugar for energy. Don't go above 75-100 grams thereafter. Less if you must to keep losing or maintaining your weight.     7. Drink at least 64 oz. of water a day. This will help maintain the right chemistry in your body to convert the fat to energy.    I discuss this and more at http://www.looserdiary.blogspot.com|`|U5ENMmXmaa	Won't that be fun to look amazing when he arrives?  You didn't mention your eating plan.  Do you intend to change that too?  Exercise alone rarely makes a huge difference in your appearance.  Here are some tips for weight loss that include an exercise plan:  There's two ways you could go and I think either way will work for you.  First of all, my best suggestion is to learn to eat healthy.    http://www.easy-weightloss-tips.com/eat-...  That means understand the food pyramid, the food groups, the recommended servings, etc.  That is how you should eat for life!  If you eat that way and have 3 small, healthy meals a day and 2 small, healthy snacks, you will lose weight.  Each meal should be less than 400 calories and each snack should be about 100-150 calories.  Eating highly nutritious foods is the key, so think in terms of lean protein, veggies, whole-grains, fruits, low-fat dairy, and heart-healthy oils.    The second option is to do a short-term "drastic diet" that is designed to last for 2 weeks max.  This would take off the most weight rapidly.  There are several on the site under "Diet Plans" but my favorite is the 5-4-3-2-1 diet.    http://www.easy-weightloss-tips.com/5-4-...  You get to pick what you eat, but you're going to want to pick highly nutritious foods to keep your metabolism working efficiently.  Again, the "eat healthy" page can help you determine what highly nutritious foods are, if you need help with that.  If you go on the short-term diet, then once it's over, follow the guidelines on the "eat healthy" page.      Make water your main source of hydration and save the sweet drinks (even diet) for special occasions.  Eliminate as much salt and sugar from your diet as you can.    The biggest component to fast weight loss is going to be your workout.  You will want to make sure you do a good (30 minute minimum) cardio workout every day for weight loss (3 times a week is sufficient to maintain health).  Activities that use the large leg muscles burn the most calories.  These activities also tone the lower body quite effectively.  Think in terms of power walking, jogging, biking, skating, swimming laps, jumping rope, dancing, racquetball, and jumping jacks.  To make sure that you're burning fat, you need to be sweating and huffing and puffing.  Don't do the same thing all the time.  Mix it up occasionally to boost your metabolism.  In addition, do some good stretches and some strength training.    http://www.easy-weightloss-tips.com/targ...    You'll find some really good information on the website, including about five pages of weight loss tips, printable weight loss journal pages, printable exercise log sheets, motivational ideas, healthy recipes, etc.  Good luck!    |`|E4UT1fi9aa	Will totally depend on your diet. Weight loss is 80-90% diet. If you don't reduce your calories, you won't lose any weight no matter how much you exercise.  Safe weight loss is considered 1-2 pounds a week.  You'll lose more in the beginning due to water loss.  Walking or running a mile will burn approx. 100 calories.  Depending on your condition, interval training is your best bet for weight loss.  However, you should have a base level of conditioning to do it.  Interval training will give you maximum calorie burn while your working out, as well as, burning calories at a higher rate for 24 hours after your workout.  Good luck|`|ERH7Xezyaa	Congratulations on your purchase. Now you can exercise anytime you want in the comfort of your own home. In two months, you can lose 15 pounds safely. However, you do not need to exercise everyday and for that long (1-2 hours). Forty-five minutes to an hour a day at 3.5 to 4.5 mph is good enough.   Try to work out 4-5 times out of the week to elevate your heart rate. And in addition, lift moderately heavy weights for muscle groups all over your body at least twice a week. You can use 3 to 10 pound dumbbells for an upper body workout, and do squats and lunges for the lower body. Use weights that you can lift at least 8 to 10 times. Build up to 2-3 sets of each exercise. At the end of your workout, your muscles should feel tired. You can purchase a strength-training workout DVD to learn how to do these exercises effectively and safely.  This workout regimen along with cutting out junk foods and eating healthy most of the time should help you lose weight.   Try not to lose weight too fast. Anything more than 2 pounds a week is not advisable. This advice is from my personal experience and knowledge. Good luck.|`|fIRBI416aa	well you can try this...     Take your bodyweight times it by 12 to get your "maintenance" calorie daily intake. This is on an average around how many calories a day it takes to maintain the weight you're at now. It's just a rough estimate, it's different for all but usually around bodyweight times 12. This number is important to know because it's the starting point for everything else to go by.    Now secondly, diet is of huge importance obviously. If you're really serious about the weight loss, cut the carbs to 30 grams or less daily. Despite what you may have heard, low carb diets are not a fad they have indeed been scientifically proven to allow more fat burning due to the fact that carbohydrates impede the hormones involved in utilizing stored fats for fuel. This can be confirmed by any biologist or physiologist worth their weight in salt.     Keep protein at at least one gram per lb. of your body that ISN'T fat. You will have to go to a gym someplace and get your bodyfat measured with calipers. Do not use the electrical impedence tests they are way inaccurate. Demand caliper testing.Once you know your bodyfat % then it's easy to know how much weight on you is fat and how much is lean mass. You want 1 gram per lb. of that lean mass number.     As for fats, try and get most of them from omega 3-6-9 oil supplements you can buy at health food stores.     So with all that said, let's say you're 170 lbs and 20% bodyfat. This means you have about 135 lbs of lean mass on your body.  This then means you want at least 135 grams of protein in your daily diet. Toss in the 30 grams of carbs and at least 10 grams of fat. Calories so far in the diet is 754. That's way too low however. We want to bring it up to at least 1200. We do not want to do it via more carbs so that leaves us with fats and proteins to play with, and proteins take priority. So lets add in 100 more grams of protein. That's 400 more calories (protein is 4 calories per gram, carbs have 4 and fats have 9). We're at 1154. Let's fill the rest up with more good fats. 10 more grams should be good so you're going to be taking in a total of 20 grams of fat daily. This brings the total to 1244. Good enough.     You'll obviously have to do this match to your own sepcifications and of course as yuo lose weight you will need to readjust the numbers and you will end up eating less.     You can fill up on as much lettuce and spinach and roccolli and vegetables that have barely any calories. Drink at least a gallon of water daily. Take multivitamin supplements and calcium. Once a week just for the sake of keeping yourself sane, break your diet a bit and maybe eat more relaxed up to 200 grams of carbs (do not see it as an excuse to hit the chinese buffet and pig out, it's a controlled break from the diet not a pig out).     As for how much weight you can lose, who knows. Look at it this way, if you're 170 lbs and your maintenance calories were around 2000 lbs and you're eating only 1200 calories then you're already losing 800 calories daily. There are 3500 calories in a lb of fat. So you'd lose a lb of fat on average every 5 days just from food restriction. Not to mention you are burning calories on the treadmill.     Good luck.

WtTFQ4aLaa	Pot doesn't have any long lasting negative effects on your health, except you might get fat and lose your sense of smell.  It is only psychologically addicting, not physically addicting.  Almost everyone I know has smoked pot (though I haven't).  It honestly isn't a big deal.    However, some people have negative effects when they smoke it.  So even though you probably won't be permanently damaged, you might want to stop smoking pot, because it doesn't sound like you're enjoying it.|`|44ab537503b323dcb61fd2a3b8221f88aa	no its not normall  it means the ailens have planted a series of chips in your head  nothing to do with getting high|`|AA10395760	well.    doing drugs is not normal.  so.  no.  it's not normal.    hugs, not drugs.|`|HUPo9Fraaa	wow, seriously???  you ask this "health question"  why should you care about your health if you're screwing up your life right now!  I mean, who cares whether you're twitching. You're smoking pot! You're already damaging yourself. You must be high right now, or just really stupid.  Please, if you want health, just quit.|`|qMAoxXMcaa	You're a druggy fix youself you're dieing. Go get help bro.|`|AA11165839	probably just nervous and paranoid.  by the way pot has the opposite effects of drug Rimonabant (google wikipedia and rimonabant).  Ribonabant can cause serious central nervous system problems, but pot has the opposite effect, I think.  If you twitch I'm not sure pot is the cause unless its cold and you are nervous.    good luck man    by the way the pot may be adulterated so if it's not pure it may have other dangerous drugs or rat poison that can cause twitching.  Then it is pretty dangerous.  so make sure its pure.    by the way pot in general are not recommended but its way safer than some prescription drugs|`|T2IIDjboaa	if you're a meth user or a retard|`|XFbwDn4Haa	I have to laugh at all these holier-than-though crusaders saying in effect "My God!  You're smoking pot!!!  What do you expect!!!!??".  My guess is none of them really have any meaningful experience with smoking pot (not that I have either, of course!), so I wouldn't give their opinions much credibility.    Truth is, marijuana is much less harmful than many legal substances like alcohol, tobacco and the like and the only REAL issue with it is that it is illegal.  The twitching you are experiencing may be caused by some neurological reaction to THC (active ingredient in marijuana), but could also just be some sort of coincidental occurence.  Either way, it isn't likely to be a serious problem so what you need to decide is if  whether or not the benefits of getting stoned are worth this inconvenient side-effect.  If the answer is "no", then quit smoking pot.  If the answer is "yes"....well, you fill in the blanks.    Good luck either way.
kTqgnfZnaa	I am also a full time college student and when I get out of school I work until 5. I am home and awake a total of 4-5 hours a day. And those hours are generally spent either with my boyfriend or doing homework, so I think I understand your situation. What I found that works best for me is to exercise! It kinda seems like a contradiction but I sleep better when I work out before dinner. Eating right also helps you get more energy. Fresh fruits are great. Also avoid simple carbs like sugar because I can give you a lot of energy and then your blood sugar drops very quickly so it makes you sleepy.|`|3cLA6wCWaa	the first place i'd look is your diet. you say you eat enough but can you tell me how many calories, exactly, you eat each day?    most people grossly under report their food intake or grossly over report their food intake.    the lesson there is we don't really know until we add it all up!    at your current bodyweight, you should be eating approx 1900 to maintain your bodyweight. how do you add up?      secondly, i'd look at your vitamins and mineral intake.    thirdly, it may be a medical issue. sometimes our thyroid is out of whack.    lastly, maybe you need to add some cardio & weight lifting into your life.      good luck!|`|9AQyHtHHaa	make sure u eat good meals especially breakfast...also multi vitamins could help a little
070Jg5c0aa	No, it doesn't mean that.    no one can predict if you'll ever get one again.  there are people who get only one cold sore, then never again the rest of their lives --  I should know because I am one of them.      I had one cold sore when I was 23 years old, and have never had another one. And now I'm 43.    no worries - this is a benign nuisance, that's all.  Not worth worrying about.  it will go away on it's own without treatment, and it may or may not ever bother you again.  If you DO get frequently recurrent lesions on your lip, they can be treated quite easily . In that case see your family doctor, or local infectious disease specialist.|`|06cCap0Oaa	cold sores are a type of herpes, which usually recurr.

C88VCkvnaa	Focus on eating more of healthy and high calorie foods. Gourging yourself on junk food is not healthy and will only cause you health problems later in life.  Some good foods:  Peanut Butter  Nuts (Almonds, etc)  Calorie-rich drinks (milkshakes, whole milk, juice)  Increasing your portion size  Lean meats for protein    Basically eat more of healthy food. Make sure you get enough calories.

As long as you are keeping a healthy diet, you'll be ok.|`|3cLA6wCWaa	No.  Carbs have a tendency to make 75% of the population fat, especially as we age. However, Asians process carbs much better than every other race does. Hence why they can eat so many and not get fat.    Sugar and eating processed carbs will give you a higher chance of getting adult onset diabetes.|`|svbFM4Zyaa	No but eating brown rice is best. White rice is not very healthy for you.

But you could get it if you have a strong family history of Diabetes,are grossly overweight or have had gestational diabetes in the past.
NyTkZJQ0aa	Probably not enough.  You need more calories and protein in order to feul you for the rest of the morning.  Eggs is a great breakfast due to the protein it has in it.  Studies show that if you eat eggs in the morning, you could burn up to 65% more calories that day than you would without eating protein in the morning.|`|224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	If you want to lose weight you have to have a balanced breakfast with a sizable portion of protein. This has been proven in recent studies to be quite a big factor in dieting success. The protein provides a feeling of fullness that leads to wanting less food at lunch and in the afternoon.
7e9f66e8183a6115754d5680f9ad5f36aa	3000 to 4000 calories a day is not low.  In fact, it's more than double the recommended amount for a moderately active male.    With weight training, you'll need to eventually get up to that level of calorie intake but you don't start there, you start lower and build up as you increase your workout.

Your BMR( Basal Metabolic Rate) is 1900. Lets say you burn 1000 calories every day. That would mean that in order to maintain your weight you shouldn't be eating more then 2900 calories. If you want to lose those 7 pounds, you need to be eating between 1900 and 2300 calories every day. Hope that helps.

Okay, so you screwed up...who hasn't? You have to realize that waht you've done in the past is not something you can change. FORGET IT! It's done. How is GUILT going to gelp you? You have to keep moving forward. Every minute that passes is an opportunity to take up a new habit. I was doing a little Meth and then my dealer got put in jail on an unrelated charge. I thought to myself, okay, I can sit around and fiend, or I can face my situation head- on. I can WANT it all day long, but there's not one damned thing I can do about it, so I just make myself keep moving and doing other things. If you wanna stop, just stop...it really is that easy. If you don;t wanna stop, then MAKE DAMNED SURE you are taking care of all of your responsibilities, and don't smoke it. It's not the drugs that get you- it's the addiction that gets you. People put all kinds of things- sex, gambilng, work, etc- at the top of their list of priorities. Don;t let the addiction get you.

This program works to remove the toxins in the body that are stored in the fat cells.  You cannot get rid of the fat cells unless you get rid of the toxins.  We get toxins from pesticides, preservatives, fast food additives, chemicals, pollution, smoke etc I have been on Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, Medifast and Atkins.  All work great for a few weeks then the weight loss slows to 1 or 2 pounds a week and the motivation drops.  This was my first experience with cleansing and it worked wonderful!

Most of the ones over the counter don't work, and just cause more problems.    If you really want a pill to help, I would suggest looking up any of your local doctor's weight loss clinics.  They normally don't cost too much, and the doctor can prescribe appetite suppressants.  I know some of the places even give weekly fat burning shots that have B12, and B complex for energy and metabolism, and lipovite to burn fat.      In the end the natural way is the best way, but if all else fails, it's best just to go to a doctor for help.
qq5nceCXaa	You have to get into energy deficit.  A good goal is around 500cal/day which would lose you half a kilo a week.  Don't aim for more than 1000cal deficit at your weight and height as you have a BMI of around under 25 already, which is fine! The lowest you want to go is around 50kg.  This means a 10-20 week programme.    Given your size and weight you'll probably burn off around 600cal/hour on the cross trainer if you're getting to the point where you start to struggle to speak.  That's a good measure of the exertion level, if you could hold a conversation you can afford to step up the pace.  alternatively build up your stamina by increasing the duration or adding in another exercise, running, cycling, swimming.      What are you doing in addition to the x trainer?  Consider weights, if you don't you'll lose muscle tissue as well as fat.  Even at rest muscle burns of fat and it makes it much less likely that you'll regain the weight afterwards.    The best advice is to forget the weight loss and think of it as a fitness goal.  Focus on the simple mantra of eat less move more.  Keep a food diary for a week or two and see what you really eat and drink.  Find a goal for your exercise, maybe enter a 10K run in the summer or plan something else where fitness matters.  The weight loss will happen if you do this, but you won't be a slave to the scales.  The benefit is that exercise will become a life long habit and you'll not have to worry about diets and so on in the future.|`|7MGGFqs0aa	Start counting how many you eat a day and start eating less calories and working out more|`|fJQIBXkPaa	to lose one pound you need to burn 3500 calories. figure out how many calories you burn a day with out working out then figure in how much you burn working out, subtract the amount of calories your taking in and you will have exactly how many calories your burning a day.|`|eEZa4MO4aa	simple answer is: eat less calories than you normally consume to keep your current weight. how many calories do you normally consume? figure that out, and then cut down on calories. Don't be fooled by how much you are "burning", as some machines tend to be WAY off. Exercise is AWESOME, and congrats for doing it, but that isnt the only thing you have to do in order to lose weight.     Also, random tip, drink 1-2 8oz. glasses of water before each meal, it helps keep you hydrated and fills you up faster.     But whatever you do, do NOT starve yourself! A good goal is to lose 1-2 pounds per week, or .5-1 kg per week.|`|L0873cdDaa	3500 calories = 1 pound

f7d33c04a72a7226a9f74dd65f7f929faa	Please read the recommendations below. Also, go to the book store and locate the book "Weight Training for Dummies". In chapter 15 you will find excellent information on how to perform abdominal exercises correctly. Page 218 of the book dispels all the myths surrounding abdominal training.     The following healthy living recommendations will help you if youre trying to lose weight, tone up your muscles, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:    *1) Burn more calories then you're consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity minus the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF). A website that explains this formula in more detail and will help you determine how many calories you need to reach or maintain a certain weight is at http://www.primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/...    Get a diet and fitness calculator that you can put on your computer or cell phone. This will allow you to easily calculate the above formula, set goals, log your daily calorie consumption, and register your physical activities.     Set realistic goals for your ideal body weight. Here are two websites that will calculate a suggested body weight:          Adults: http://www.halls.md/ideal-weight/body.ht...  Teens/Children: http://www.kidshealth.org/kid/exercise/w...    It is difficult and unhealthy to lose more than one or two pounds per week. There are 3,500 calories in a pound. If you eat 500 fewer calories per day for a week you will lose one pound. If you burn through exercise 500 more calories per day for a week you will lose one pound.     *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement.     Avoid High Glycemic Load Carbs (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as potatoes) and drink lots of water. Read this article for more information on high GL Carbs:  http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsou...    Do not try fad diets or diet pills. Here is an excellent food pyramid that anyone can follow: http://www.rayandterry.com/html/images/P...    *3) Exercise on most days by doing cardiovascular training and/or resistance training activities.     Read a book or find a certified trainer to make sure your doing all resistance training exercises correctly. A great book to buy that teaches you the resistance training basics is Weight Training for Dummies. A superb magazine to buy with resistance training routines that will not get you bored is "Muscle and Fitness". Signup for the free newsletter. An excellent free online resource is at http://www.exrx.net/    A good book to buy that teaches you the cardiovascular training basics is Fitness for Dummies.     *4) Get plenty of sleep. Sleep experts say most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night for optimum performance, health, and safety.     *5) Educate yourself continually on health issues and make a life long commitment to good health. A great free publication is Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005. A superb book to read is You The Owners Manual. An excellent periodic publication is the Nutrition Action Health Letter. A reputable test you can take to measure your biological age is at http://realage.com    Look at all areas where you can enhance your health. For example, make improvements in the quality of the air you breathe. Review outdoor air quality forecasts where you live and get an indoor air purifier.

Si sa masse osseuse est petite il est vident que le mme poids semblera un peu plus fort:  Il ne faut pas non plus mler un indice corporel lgrement au dessus du IMC normal; comme pr gros mais simplement un rappel pour faire attention: IL faut se tenir en forme et bien manger;  simplement cette mesure racquise et la perte de poids suivra normalement  Donc flicitations tu es une bonne maman qui surveille bien son fils|`|85ae610eaa8a42d2d1f987fa1b15aed7aa	Voici la formule pour calculer le poids ideal :    Poids = Taille - 100 - ( (Taille-150) / X )    X = 4 pour les Hommes, X = 2 pour les Femmes    Pour le cas de votre fils le rsultat est    Poids = 130-100-((130-150)/4) = 35 kgs    Donc il est un peu leger.

Si ce dsir est vraiment profond, vous n'aurez pas besoin de patch. Bien s?r ce ne sera pas facile mais c'est surmontable. Le plus difficile est de passer chacun des petits moments o le besoin se fait sentir. Ces moments ne durent pas forcment longtemps, mais vous ressentez vraiment qu'il vous manque quelque chose. C'est par exemple en fin de repas, avec votre caf, ou  l'apro, ou mme quand vous vous accordez une pause au travail ou  la maison en vous disant inconsciemment que vous allez vous offrir une dtente, sans vous rendre compte que cette dtente est lie  la consommation de tabac. Et puis vous cherchez ce qui vous manque et vous vous rendez compte que c'est une clope ! l c'est terrible car il faut remplacer ce rflexe par autre chose. Personnellement, dans ces moments difficiles, j'appelais tabac info services, juste pour parler. Cela m'a beaucoup aide. J'ai aussi essay d'viter de consommer de l'alcool et du caf pendant cette priode parce qu'ils taient trop lis au tabac. J'tais une grosse fumeuse. J'ai fum pendant 24 ans et j'ai arrt du jour au lendemain sans patch.  J'ai considr ce challenge toujours  court terme. Chaque jour gagn tait une victoire et j'tais toujours heureuse le matin d'annoncer  mes collgues que je n'avais pas craqu le soir ou pendant le week end. Il faut associer son entourage  ses victoires. Je dois vous dire que j'ai essay trois fois d'arrter de fumer les deux premires tentatives ont t des checs,  chaque fois je refumais au bout d'un mois. Mais maintenant je me considre comme "non fumeur" et plus comme "fumeur qui a arrt de fumer". Ce chemin l aussi est important.  L'important c'est que vous essayiez.

wg3KFiVqaa	First of all, your husband is selfish. You have endured two pregnancies and two "terrible endings." AND he wants you to get a painful and invasive surgery that will require a long recovery? I'm sorry, but he can miss two days of work and get a minimally invasive procedure that can be easily reversed if you all change your mind later.   As for Mirena, it hurts. I have a coworker who has had hers for almost two months, and she is STILL in pain from it, to the point of considering having it removed.

Quand il fait froid, la circulation sanguine s'intensifie pour rchauffer le corps. De ce fait, le sang est filtr un plus grand nombre de fois par les reins.

Lorsqu'il fait chaud, l'organisme utilise l'eau pour vacuer la chaleur excssive par la transpiration afin de maintenir l'homostasie. Mais lorsqu'il fait froid, l'eau qui est dans notre organisme se refroidit aussi; ce qui baisse la temprature corporelle. Pour viter cela, une hormone dans notre corps est inhibe. Il s'agit de l'ADH(hormone antidiurtique), hormone dont la fonction est d'assurer la rabsorption de l'eau et autres lectrolytes au niveau du rein. De ceci, nous disons l'envie de pisser quand il fait froid vient du fait que l'hormone qui assure la retention de l'eau dans l'organisme est inhibe par le froid.|`|d211d99c24d7d29af34e04ac31403bffaa	quand il fait froid,il y'a ce qu'on appelle une vaso-constriction peripherque qui engendre une augmentation de la quantite de sang traverssant le rein qui est appel dans ce cas a travailler plus et automatiquement on urine beaucoup.|`|1bf23336d17963e59a2db4610f130202aa	Parce que le froid contracte les muscles, y compris celui de la vessie... donc envie de pipi !|`|0021df20c928f26716235792edac6ac3aa	Pourquoi quand je jouais  cache-cache quand j'tais petite j'avais toujours envie de faire pipi ??????????|`|e7be243336045b2a05c84de98c7b7fbeaa	parce que quand il fait froid il y a beaucoup d'humidit, et que donc l'air que tu respires contient beaucoup d'eau qui va dans ton corps, voila pourquoi!|`|a66aeb055e3e9807724a67c59739c19baa	moi c'est quand il pleut que j'ai envie de faire pipi.|`|ac323d4429ef881423eb49cef18baea7aa	parce que le pipi c'est chaud|`|fe6517334df856c28ecb9e3e6151a3cdaa	Tout simplement parce que lorsque la temprature extrieure baisse, ton corps (qui lui doit se maintenir  une temprature proche de 37 degr) se met en mode "conomie d'nergie".

But it is no fat burning miracle.|`|NPzDQmlQaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.      Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.      First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.    However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.

Des scientifiques bretons sur la piste de nouveaux mdicaments  samedi 4 dcembre 2004.       la Station biologique de Roscoff, les travaux mens par Jean-Pierre Salan et Philippe Potin1 permettent de nourrir quelques espoirs en ce sens. Les biologistes bretons viennent de montrer que les algues peuvent tre de vritables usines  acides gras.    Plus exactement,  drivs oxyds dacides gras quon pourrait utiliser comme mdicaments. On sait depuis une vingtaine dannes que les algues fabriquent, lorsquelles sont agresses par des microbes, des drivs dacides gras proches de ceux que lon retrouve chez lhomme. Ce sont, par exemple, les prostaglandines et les leucotrines qui interviennent dans de nombreux processus biologiques et qui entra?nent un dsquilibre physiologique quand ils font dfaut, voire une toxicit sils ne sont pas bien rguls. ? Il existe bien des mthodes de synthse chimique pour obtenir des drivs dacides gras essentiels  lhomme, mais elles sont lourdes, co?teuses et naboutissent pas  une copie exacte des molcules actives, affirme Philippe Potin. Avec nos recherches, on peut envisager une production importante dacides gras oxyds par les algues elles-mmes. ?    La mthode, qui a fait lobjet dun brevet avec la socit malouine Go?mar, consiste  stimuler les dfenses immunitaires dune algue rouge en introduisant dans son organisme des extraits dune algue verte. ? Lalgue rouge ragit alors contre le parasite en produisant  partir de lacide arachidonique, prsent galement chez lhomme, des drivs qui ont une action antimicrobienne et qui lui permettent damplifier la rponse immunitaire en cas de nouvelle agression ?, explique le biologiste. Une fois certains acides gras isols et purifis, les chercheurs tudient leurs effets sur les algues elles-mmes et sur dautres organismes vivants, des rats et des cellules humaines en culture3. Rcemment, ils sont parvenus  bloquer in vitro la diffrenciation de cellules spcialises dans le stockage des graisses. Ces cellules arrtent demmagasiner des lipides grace  linfluence de deux drivs dacides gras de lalgue rouge. Un autre brevet a t dpos pour protger cette dcouverte. Pour les biologistes, cest un premier pas vers le dveloppement de futurs mdicaments.

La ralit est toute autre : Virus et bactries n'ont rien de commun,  commencer par la taille, celle de la bactrie est au virus ce que celle de l'lphant est  la souris (en gros, si j'ose dire).    Le mot virus signifie poison en latin !  Le virus ne fait pas partie du monde vivant car, contrairement  la bactrie, il ne respire pas, ne peut avoir de mouvement propre, il ne grandit pas et ne peut se reproduire seul. C'est une sorte de modle frontire entre le vivant et le minral.  Les virus sont constitus d'un seul type d'acide nuclique ARN ou ADN entour d'une enveloppe, ils ne peuvent se rpliquer qu' l'intrieur d'une cellule vivante en utilisant la machinerie de cette dernire. C'est cette particularit d'intgrer le matriel gntique d'une cellule qui est utilis en thrapie gnique : on introduit le gne dans la cellule en l'intgrant  un virus (inoffensif videmment).  Les virus affectant l'homme sont constitus de gnes trs proches des gnes des cellules humaines.    Toutes les bactries ne sont pas pathognes, il y a environ une centaine d'espces pathognes sur 5000. Mieux, certaines bactries vivent en symbiose avec l'homme, par exemple de nombreuses bactries dans le tube digestif sont indispensables (digestion, production de vitamine K).    En mdecine, la grande diffrence entre virus et bactries rside dans le traitement : les virus sont insensibles aux antibiotiques, ceci explique que la seule arme contre les plus dangereux rside dans la vaccination. Pour la mme raison, c'est ce qui rend redoutable l'infection par le virus du SIDA, qui a cependant l'avantage de stimuler la recherche en virologie dont les progrs en quelques annes sont spectaculaires.|`|2eeded549d64c32052407d33fbc7ebd0aa	un virus est une entit biologique qui ncessite une cellule h?te, dont il utilise les constituants pour se multiplier.

AA11315244	Hi :)<br>  <br>  I'm really sorry to hear this. If your still able to fully extend and flex your pinky its not broken. ALSO if you still have feeling in it. It sounds like you may have bruised your finger. Put a cold compress on it and your body will heal it at it's on pace. I left you two websites..one about bruises and one about how to treat them. Good Luck :) and I hope you get better!!|`|ePybeRq0aa	The same thing happened to me!  I just ran into a wall playing basketball.  I think it is broken, but just to make sure, I would see a doctor.  I would also keep it wrapped up in sports tape and not play until Monday or Tuesday or until it feels better.  Ice works good too :)|`|2ObqoJbKaa	It very well could be broken, its probabaly severely bruised too. You should definetly go in and get a doctor to check it out. if its broken and you don't go in and get it set, your finger could be messed up for you whole life. Go in soon to the doctor. good luck.|`|BThdUonXaa	No, it's not broken. if you can still move it, then it is most likely just jammed. the greenish color means that it's healing. if it's not better in a week, see a doctor.
AA11262612	maderma can take weeks and is primarily for reducing scars.  i believe it gives some time information in the package.
he7D7huDaa	I think trouble with going early morning your body has just had an 8 hour sleep so you are not gonna have much energy in the way of food carbs in  your body unless you get up earlier to eat a decent amount to burn. its best at the end of day you've eaten most of your calorie intake and got plenty of fuel to burn. plus you ain't got long to go for your body to get total rest to go to sleep. hope this helps.|`|H9AlDTZOaa	I work out every morning and it doesnt affect me in the least. But I have been working out consistently and I am in very good shape. I'd say that after a couple weeks your body will get used to it and will gain better endurance and it wont affect you either.|`|zz6VcUewaa	its because your outta shape. because if you were in shape it wouldnt matter what time of the day you went you wouldnt be tired. i run everyday and everyday i run its a different time. like some days in the mornings others in the afternnoons and others at night.
AA10774599	You must eat to lose weight! It's a fact. When you "starve" yourself, you force your metabolism to hold on to fat and calories. <br>  <br>  Eat! But I must say, your food chjoices aren't too healthy sounding. Nuggets and fries equal a days worth or more of fat. <br>  <br>  Eat healthy by making small changes that you can live with. Make sweet potato strips by steaming them. Cut up some chicken and cook it in olive oil or in a grill like George Foreman or something where no oil is needed. By doing so, you just ate healthy and are on your way to dropping pounds and inches.|`|cae6c8e25d6a61178ea135a0b7c41725aa	I have a simular problem but I was dieting for a long time, I guess it's connected to your body getting used to the old programms, have to change them.|`|XOlnc8iBaa	Your body is in starvation mode coz you don't feed it. Nuggets are fat, fries are fat, and that's all your body gets, so it realizes you are starving it, and is holding onto fat. Google a 2000 calorie a day eating plan and follow it to the letter. You should be eating 6 times a day, and healthy foods, which you are not. The same happened to me, I lost 30 pounds and then decided to starve myself. Three months passed and I did not lose weight but as soon as I started eating 6 times a day, and did weights every second day I lost it. I have 14 pounds to lose now and I look better than ever. Try it, it works.|`|MzCL0dzjaa	What you're doing wrong is your eating habbits. By eating so little a day your metabolism falls through the ground because your body recognizes it's not getting a lot of energy/food so what it does is it tries to store as most as possible. Plus by starving yourself like that you will start to burn muscle away and not fat.<br>  <br>  You need to eat 6 small meals a day, around 200 calories or so. High in fiber (it keeps you full), vegetables, lean meat...ect.<br>  <br>  If you eat 6 times a day it will make your metabolism a lot higher because your body will recognize it's getting food constantly throughout the day and will want to burn the energy. So eat 6 times a day and do atleast 20 minutes of cardio a day. Make sure to have a good amount of protein or else you'll be burning muscle.|`|CdWeifNfaa	ahhhh hard idk|`|NPMKqJlMaa	go swim till dawn u will loose weight|`|P3YUwjKmaa	This may sound funny but you are cutting back too much, your body is going into starvation mode and hanging onto the fat that it does have. That's what happens when you cut back too much and based on how much you are exercising and how little you are eating I bet that is it. When I lost 70 pounds I would take one day a week off of the diet completely so that my body would not go into starvation mode and it REALLY worked out well. Try that, also nuggets and fries are extremely high in bad fats (saturated fats that is) try cutting back on those as well as sugar and drinking 8 glasses of water a day. Those last few pounds are really stubborn and you just have to be more stubborn and VERY patient.           -Best Wishes, Leaky

MzCL0dzjaa	Well to lose weight you have to burn more calories than you take in.<br>  <br>  So instead of walking I'd fast pace walk or jog. You need to get the heart pumping.|`|ScUS0VyAaa	Calories is a major subject when it comes to weight loss. We need to learn 3 definitions: the amount of calories in our food, the amount of calories a specific activity expends hourly, and last but not least our own personal daily allowance of calories. The one method which really worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a few free trials left, it has been featured in Fox News and CNN. I lost 20 pounds, it really does work!|`|IKkU3retaa	use a weight loss supplement call ORVO or hydroxy cut harcore, check out the websites      www.muscletech.com and google orvo, i dont know the address for it.
UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/reducebodyfat.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...</a>|`|mKCFz2d1aa	you should do butt lifts which is putting a small weight in the back of your knee while your on your hands and knees then life the knee back and then down. do 35 a day each leg and your thighs will lose.. also squats for your lower body. for love handles the best one to do is the punch zig zag crunch.. do regular crunches and while you go up punch side to side 4 times while your going down zig zag side to side|`|AA10774599	Bend from the waist.

It meant I was growing and my arms were getting bigger.  <br>  <br>  I never tried to do anything the day after that involved straining them or anything like that.  <br>  <br>  I always let them rest.

I've known many people to smoke it and smoke it regularly, and I've never been impressed with what they become when they're stoned (I think in some it definitely induces laziness...my uncle, a daily smoker, is a picture of that).

ParFJxnSaa	Treatment of many phobias using systematic desensitisation therapy has been demonstrated to be effective. It is always best to use a professional therapist, and clinical psychologists are a good choice, since they tend to rely less on the use of medication, except possibly in the early stages, in their more extreme cases. If you are unable to access the services of a professional, or need a quick result, you can try the following. You may wish to have something to help relax you, first. Short term only, try valerian root, (some people experience "valerian hangovers") or chamomile. Once you feel it starting to become effective, look fleetingly, at a picture (it can be an illustration, drawing, photograph, or Google an image of it; for example: enter "spider; photo" in the searchbar) of the thing which causes your phobia, from a distance.<br>  <br>  Then look away, and observe how you feel. Uncomfortable? Afraid? Abject terror? Let that feeling subside. You survived that, didn't you? Next, (these steps need not all be done on the one day, depending on how well you respond, but I wouldn't leave any gaps, returning to it on the next day) look at it from the same distance, but longer. Next, focus intently on it. Always expect to experience some level of discomfort, as you follow these steps, but the idea is to gradually become used to that stimulus, and the knowledge that you have survived the previous steps helps give you the confidence to tackle the next one.<br>  <br>  Then, approach the image/picture a little closer. Next, closer still, until you are within an arm's length. Then reach out toward it, and, if feeling confident enough, possibly touch it lightly, and quickly. Next, touch it longer, and from closer up. Then look at a real version of it, from a distance. It can be small, or artificial, or both. You can do any, or all of these in the company of a trusted friend, or family member, but if you do this, you will have to do it all over again, alone, because they won't always be there, and you need to develop your competence in such situations. The same thing applies with the use of anxiolytics, either herbal, O.T.C., or prescription. Alone, and unaided! Next, approach it from closer up. Then touch it. Then leave your hand on it, or pick it up, and look at it. Note: you can stop at any stage you feel is sufficient to cope. In your case, consider getting a fake spider in a brown paper bag, from a novelty store; when you have made sufficient progress, approach with a shoe, or rolled up newspaper; dump & wallop!|`|a0LbAryDaa	Keep in mind that most spiders couldn't even harm you, if they were to bite you. Also, when I spider crawls on you, it literally feels like a piece of hair falling on you're hand, so its not too bad :).

DsEEATKSaa	Viewing this issue as 'black and white' is not helpful, and only leads to misunderstanding of psychiatry, psychology, and psychological illnesses. In addition, you run a risk here of inappropriately labeling illness as sin/evil (and visa versa).     Most assuredly, evil exists. People commit evil acts on a regular basis. By the same token, psychiatric conditions such as sociopathy and psychotic disorders also exist, and may (or may not, as the case may be) contribute to the "evil" actions of affected individuals.    Simply put: both are true. Both evil AND psychiatric illnesses exist, and may co-exist in a single individual. However, one does not have to necessitate the other. A shizophrenic woman, for example, may commit evil overtly evil deeds  (e.g., she plans and executes the murder of a rival without being influenced by hallucinations or delusions), or her behavior may be completely unrelated to sin/evil (e.g., she shots a person she considered to be her rival because she is hallucinating that the person is actually a tiger about to kill her child). The end result is the same (i.e., the rival of the schizophrenic woman is dead). One act could quite appopriately be considered "evil"/sin, whilst the other is clearly not.    To imply that psychiatry has exused sin/evil is far too simplistic and is, frankly, misleading. Psychiatry has shed light on illness which may result in behavior that has previously (erroneously) been labeled as "evil" or "sinful".|`|By2HAU85aa	Yes, well it seems that ignorance really IS bliss, now doesn't it?People are not inherently bad, evil, or cruel.Laymen are just that, uneducated masses with unqualifiable opinions.|`|638f88cfa68bfb20c409876f784551dbaa	"Evil" is a moral/ethical judgment on someone, based on your own personal value system.    Psychiatry judges people scientifically, based on their neurological/biochemical functioning.    It is not the job of science to make moral judgments...that's the realm of religion, government and philosophy.|`|AA11733521	There is a book done by a psychiatrist which addresses your question, and quite admirably I might add. It's title is "People Of The Lie" by M. Scott Peck, the man who also wrote "The Road Less Traveled". I think it's one of the best books I've read concerning human evil, which is really where evil comes from, if you think about it. Nature isn't evil. The Universe isn't evil. Only man is capable of evil. Peck has done a thoughtful study on the subject. You may find it helpful. I wish you peace.

Both of these types should be avoided - the latter could be dangerous.|`|sEQSTur9aa	Who cares?|`|CzPDWJvxaa	A liar knows he/she is lying, because he/she sets a goal for which he/she is lying for. A psychopathic one lies about anything, with no particular reason, compulsory.  The both kind are bad to deal with, but I think the psychopathic is the worse - with no motivation in his/hers actions, it's harder to spot|`|JFUzHbpjaa	I think most people, however honest they want to be, will end up telling the odd lie...  this may be to try and get out of trouble, as in "I did not have sexual relations with that woman," or to avoid hurting someone's feelings, the 'little white lie:' "Your new haircut looks great!"    Do such lies merit the label, "liar?"... Maybe, if one does it often enough and if it breaches trust over time.    As for the psychopatic liar, this, I think is a psychiatric or psychological diagnosis...  I do not have this kind of expertise, other that stuff I have read and personal experience... but I would say it means the kind of repeated and assertive lying done often enough, that the liar ends up believing their own lies, especially when used to justify doing something that is hurtful, wrong, or even criminal.|`|WXSN8c4faa	Any one who lies a lot, everywhere, anytime, or repeatedly; Anyone who uses lying as a defence mechanism in his life, is a psychopathic liar.
PiLwfXiBaa	I started having severe back pain.  I had every test there was.  There was no biological explanation for my pain.    I eventually was sent to a psychologist.  Right from the beginning, he knew that I had held my feelings in for so long, and now my subconscious was ready to let me know it was time to get help.  My psychosomatic symptoms were caused by severe stress.  This can manifest itself in different ways in different people.  My therapist practices psychoanalysis and  mindfulness.  Today, 6/1, we start our tenth year together.  Therapy is a lot of hard work but the rewards are great.    Please seek professional help.  You can't do it alone.    Good luck.|`|2662bff905d732c360e759fb500fa522aa	Of thats a very technical question.
qyZhzCJTaa	Its not really bad for you, no. Just don't do that everyday, only make it a rare occasion. Everyone does it sometimes.|`|NPMKqJlMaa	huh bahahahahahha<br>  i sleep for 20 hours and sometimes a full day!|`|4OEMFrF6aa	Um no, you can never get enough sleep
b1NMh5K2aa	Yes ive skipped the week once before and i was perfectly fine. I got my next period like normal, As long as you dint skip your periods constantly then you will be fine :)|`|77NzfiVkaa	Yes, that is completely fine. Most women do it and there are actually pills that let you only have 3 or 4 periods a year. Personally i like having my period cuz if my birth control doesn't work I will know that I'm missing my period for a reason. lol<br>  <br>  Just to warn you though, I did this once and all it did was I had my period but really super light and it lasted for a MONTH!! AHH!!! Hopefully you'll have better results than me. Just be prepared for something like that to happen.|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	It is safe to do every once in a while. I have done it before. A warning though, it may come back with a vengeance before your next inactive pills.|`|vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  <br>  Don 't stop taking birth control pills just keep on taking them until you get back on your holidays.   Once you stop it comes right away.<br>  <br>  Yes it is safe that is what my doctor told me a few years ago.|`|F4mgVTgzaa	yes I do this all the time too. Not that often but Iv done it a few times. Just make sure if your having sex to use a condom just in case. But in most cases, its perfectly safe.|`|VTvtKWDCaa	Yes.  You can do this and you should be fine.<br>  <br>  People do this for their weddings a lot.|`|AA12034666	That method does work. Your next period will probably be heavier, however. It's OK to do that once in awhile, but not very often.|`|KcDRAWrtaa	it entirely depends because skipping pills can either throw your hormones around into having a period or stop hormones from producing. most pills are to regulate and MAKE you have periods. you'd have to ask your doctor about it because it can throw you off schedule pretty badly.|`|g8pRhElsaa	yes - it's totally safe. it might help you avoid your period completely, but it might not. you could still have your period or even a lighter version of it, but you could definitely try it out. just don't do it for several months in a row!|`|q1cxmThHaa	I would talk with your gynocologist because it might be different for each woman.<br>  <br>  & I would definitley abstain from sex if youre going to do this!|`|Q887qawLaa	No its not that healthy but it wont kill you. you should be fine|`|8GsvZ6deaa	my doctor said it is perfectly safe and she told me u can do it for 3 months at a time
KcDRAWrtaa	a person who has had an eating disorder is never fully healed from it because the pressure to be thin is almost CONSTANT. just like an addiction to drugs and alochol, if you set a plate of heroin and vodka in front of them, it's going to tempt them. obviously, rehab can either work wonders or they can not take it seriously and relapse all over the place.<br>  <br>  healing takes YEARS and almost all people with ED's or addictions relapse several times before getting over it.|`|AYH0RPsjaa	How very "after school special" most people are not anorexic because they lack the will power.  Being anorexic is healthier than being fat, both are hideous, and it is really not hard to maintain a 0 or a size 2.|`|koaXBU4uaa	Yeah its only a state of mind and any persons state of mind can be changed if someone really wanted to change that with a bit of effort they could,<br>  <br>  but not the effects it could have on you physically|`|igj6p3Zzaa	yes. you go to rehab if you have severe problems or you just make sure you or the person eats when they are supposed to. people have been cured before you just need to find the problem|`|ZBQN8viuaa	yah its not a disease, these anorexic people just have to get it through there heads that its not healthy,besides, not everyone likes girls that skinny anyway|`|EyjUvKtlaa	yes,<br>  usually you have got to go through thereapy though.|`|JivLAZH6aa	yeah it can be healed, its just a habit that has to be broken|`|HO3mCsQwaa	yes, with some sort of therapy|`|TwcxEsYVaa	Drink Coconut Milk and eat Coconut meal they have an enzyme that repairs the liver energy and helps to prevent vomiting.<br>  <br>  You can heat the milk and add green tea or other spices like cardamom, saffron, fennel or rose water.|`|47df3c0d4de44231c90037c396e8f6d4aa	Anorexia is like an addiction, you can become "clean" but like any other addiction it will remain a part of the victim's life. So my answer would be no.|`|uSA3XuaYaa	yes. my friend had anorexia. it took her about five months to recover. she had a great support system which i think is important.|`|IU54cQhsaa	no I don't think it can be healed. I do think it can be controlled but there is always that mental anguish over food and the guilt of eating.|`|IGpCFPWsaa	its not a scar its an emotional thing. <br>  but it can be helped.|`|xLXVSrn6aa	yes it can.|`|AA10099860	by getting over body image|`|N8EZ6gOXaa	With Popeyes, yes. With Tofu, No|`|KPtSq0Uyaa	yes.<br>  it has been healed<br>  multiple times|`|XdwJdwNEaa	nope . its hard|`|jJwuMTSqaa	Yes.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Absolutely.  With willpower and the right help.|`|lqo9aK00aa	yes i think it can be, maybe by talking to a friend or a professional<br>  i know a lot of people that had this problem most of them are really close friends<br>  and they would talk to me about it and they have gotten SO MUCH better<br>  i think it really helps|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	Yes, tho it`s a hard and painful road.  But most are healed in the end.<br>  <br>  It`s a very mysterious psychological illness.|`|364815ba0e4e52ba14aa1cef4ad4e5a0aa	yes, through counseling.<br>  <br>  How is anorexia healthier than being fat? Some people are such morons.|`|ulYTAfXtaa	yesss

You can do a few different things for this:<br>  1-Try heat for about 15-20 mins this will help with any swelling.<br>  2-Try a hot bath<br>  3-Take some aspirin or ibprophen and just rest<br>  <br>  Hope this helps I have been dealing with back pain for a few years now.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	You overdid it. Soak in a hot bath with some Epsom Salts (if you have any), take an aspirin and go to bed. Stay of the WII for a couple days.|`|oRAWPrRJaa	yea..i read on yahoo that the wii does some stuff to yur body..did you know this girl played the play station and her hands started like getting painful bumps? {you can read the story on yahoo's homepage}maybe you should stop playing for awhile. rest..if it doesnt work then go see a doctor...|`|QyzvkJRQaa	Maybe your body isn't used to the type of movement you did on the Wii. What is weird though is that I felt like that too after playing on my Wii but it won't last long trust me. Just stretch out and try your best to take deep breaths. If the pain lasts more than 2 days then maybe you should see a doctor.|`|31fd278ee422095a5f1153f3ba3dfbeaaa	The same thing happened to me. You'll be okay in a couple of days.

5b60cf8bba9d0e82014b5a70f1c32970aa	Well I suggest that if you are planning to have a ssecond baby that you lose your first baby weight before otherwise you'll put even more weight on from the second and if you allready find it difficult to shift weight then I do suggest getting rid of this weight first.    First of all I would suggest being online less and exersizing more, you cannot think you will lose weight without exersize. Try to set aside an hour a day and just do all sorts of exersize like squats, sit-ups, star-jumps, crunches, if you have a bike then go for a bike ride or go for a jog.    Secondly eat less, try eating 3 small meals a day but with all the nutrients you need, carbs, proteins, vitamins and even fats! But try to cut down on junk food, don't cut it out completely because then you'll crave it and want lots but just eat less than you usually do. Also try to drink at least 6-8 glasses of water a day.   Good Luck!  :)|`|W97kGLZ6aa	I found the Curves program worked well & fast for me. If you have 30 mins/ 3xweek to workout, its great! Water resistance machines for easy strength training at your own pace. If you sign up I suggest you read the Curves book. I found it at the library some facilities have it there to rent out. It will explain how to make it easier to follow eating guides. There are quizes in the book for you to answer and will let you know if you  are carb or calorie sensitive. So you know what you need to be watching, instead of trying to watch everything. This is important you look into this since you are worried about diabetes. It explains about how to not become a diabetic ect. If you follow this program Im telling you it works. I lost about 15 lbs in weeks!!!(but I also quit drinking pop)  :) I also was worried Id become diabetic. GOOD LUCK!|`|DG5U848naa	read tips on weight loss and home exercise programs to help you better on this site|`|a704b843a7c9461cb7457961679f054daa	Trying to lose weight can be daunting, but if you stick with it, you can do it.  Count calories AND fat - maybe try to eat 1500 calories or less per day and keep your fat gram intake under 50.  These numbers are good ones to have as a baseline.  I have to watch my weight as well and just resist temptation the best i can.  There are microwave meals at the grocery store called Michelina's Lean Gourmet that are low in calories and fat and make great easy lunches or dinners or snacks - they are 99 cents a meal so you cant beat that!  with a toddler, you should load up on them since i bet you are super busy playing with your tot!  dont worry about carbs or sugar - by eating low calorie and low fat - the carbs and sugar will automatically be balanced.  You can never go wrong with fruits and vegetables - try those as snacks.  What about getting some workout videos to do at your home?  I got one from Target that is great - its not too hard but you get results - its Pilates by Gaim with Ana Caban - intermediate i think.  I had never done pilates but the lady makes it easy.  It is not so intense that you have to watch every minute and you can keep an eye on your kids or play with them while you do it.  Just keep movin whenever you can to keep your metabolism up!  Try not to sit down unless you have to.  Good luck to you! you can do it!  :)|`|30addf6f9bf717d35cd61bbc16d988cdaa	dont  eat sugar and sugar product.try to do exercise ,eat yogurt :)
fecUjSr1aa	you can try those 1-a-day multivitamins and drink them religiously, i mean once a day, don't miss on them. you may also be suffering from vit. b12 and vit. c deficiency .. take those 100 mgs of each along with the 1-a-days. stay being a vegan ... better than being a carnivore.<br>  <br>  try this combo, see how it goes .. nothing happens then maybe perhaps its time to see a doctor and get examined ... don't forsake your health ..its the only one you got ..|`|Q6euzOmVaa	if you eat a well balanced diet, vitamins aren't really needed (except for maybe some calcium)
yYc9KSSgaa	A little bit of lotion or cover up should do the trick.|`|533cbd5eb0dd99b30a5f8427d0b02ac8aa	Aloe vera works great to soothe after waxing.  The redness will go away.|`|Ove2avMVaa	The redness will go down, and if you are going to use lotion, use lotion with no perfumes in it.  Maybe Aloe would be a good idea too.|`|vwORU7Piaa	you can try puttin milk on it sometimes it helps, also ice it a little.|`|Usq1oGUQaa	Try some neosporn or something similer like first aid cream. Waxing on any part of your body whether male or female can be bad if you dont know  when is the right time. For women never go during or right before period, basically the more hormonal you are the more sensitive your skin will be. Like when I was pregnant my skin pulled off a little, but i would go home that night and put some cream on it. It would be fine and not showing the next morning. Good Luck!!
XGgPhaDbaa	Yes you can pull your Achilles tendon.Wrap your foot, ankle and lower leg with an Ace Bandage - not too tight, borrow some crutches and stay off of it for a week or so.<br>  Soaking in Epsom Salts helps the pain.
e0faada9a8147280b25584d40c598fb3aa	go to www.plannedparenthood.com  to find one near you/ there you can get tested for stds and they will also inform you about the different types of birth control. the best part is that if you want to keep this on the low, you can nobody has to know they will only tell you the results. good luck with that!
7ZMXW4jSaa	If you are eating small portions throughout the day, then it's fine.  You shouldn't eat any less then what you have listed.  You should be getting around 1000 calories per day.|`|zz6VcUewaa	Thats actually to little. like your dinner, snack and breakfest were fine but your lunch wasnt even a lunch. maybe you should add like another yogurt or veggie or cereal bar. you could even eat a small sandwich instead.|`|KlSjISoQaa	It's too little. you've body will starve and start to eat itself. i am not joking. I know girls who didn't eat dairy and carbs. The out come? One girls period stopped as her body needed as much blood as possible due to bad diet. Another girl had weak muscle as she wasn't eating enough carbs and her body was eating away at her muscle. Ask your doctor he'll tell you this can happen.<br>  <br>  <br>  Eat a healthy realistic diet.|`|XZqSO94saa	Too much, no. Too little, yes!<br>  That's under 500 calorie's.<br>  You're basically starving you're body and it's going to go into starvation mode. <br>  Starvation mode: Where you're body start's to eat away at muscle "not" fat, afterwards shutting down function's in you're body from energy of the heart- failure of organ's, leading you feeling faint and in you're death-bed.<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to scare you but please, increase you're meal plan by alot and if you're having help talk to a local doctor or the children's help phone. It would be great if you could discuse this with you're paren'ts because its really important.<br>  <br>  Adolsent's and teenager's need to eat the most espesically because most of the density of food's goto you're hormones and growth. You're going to stunt everything and it might not ever come back (period, growth, hormone's, etc...) you probably will also develope osteoperious at a young age too from consuming 'NO' calcium! Osteoperious, is not reversable.<br>  <br>  Hope i'v helped <3.

F7JmeeuAaa	It's really different for each person.  The famous "They want attention or are weak people LOL" comment is usually wrong and made by ignorant people.  Self-harming is a very complex subject and sometimes the person even doing it doesn't know why.  Of course there is some sort of depression going on but whether the depression is chemical or something went wrong in their lives is very hard to tell.  I can tell you that most psychologists are full of it and are wrong most of the time, yet they get paid all this money.....|`|967a09fbc7809ed60c6d3a8bbe086628aa	odd question!    I am assuming 1 of 3 things.    1.  they want to commit suicide, they have come to their wits end and see no way out.  2.  they want to get out of the life they are now living but really don't want to die, they are hoping for someone to take charge of their life. (hoping someone will save them) usually their slits are not going to kill them.  3.  they are trying to stop the pain.      I knew a girl who said her mind would race so much she got dizzy and felt crazy.  she was not in control of her thoughts and would see visions race past her eyes.    the only way to stop was to cause herself pain.  she started with biting herself and pinching but later graduated to actually slicing her arms.      usually it subsides as they grow older and with medication but for some I guess time was not on their side.|`|AA11026673	been there, done that, it is to commit suicide, it is not weakness as stated here, it is depression most times. i guess there is people though that do like to hurt themselves, i am definitely not one of them, but then we both need help. i got mine.|`|6cbb2ed22a5aa8cd52f52f34c0cbf5d9aa	they want to relieve pressure|`|j4VJ0Zloaa	both|`|cMfPhfLhaa	most people who cut themselves do it as an outlet. its something they do repeatedly and its usually not a suicide attempt|`|ptvR1fFHaa	it depends for some people they are trying to end their life for others it is a way to control themselves and their feelings to bring them back to reality this is called self mutilation or self injury (google it )|`|AA12127677	There are those who do like to cut themselves as a way of relieving stress in their lives...where they cut depends on the person.  It is a type of self mutilation and is a mental illness.  Then there are those who slit their wrists to end their lives.  It is believed in certain cases that people who suffer from self mutilation have accidentally killed themselves. So to answer the question some slit to die and some slit as a way of making themselves feel better.|`|PgCVD4osaa	it depends i no cuz i used to cut my self i did it cuz i loved the pain but then it wasnt a eunff so i started to burn my self but then a girl came in to my life so i stoped|`|xE6WXVIeaa	Depends on the person. Some people are genuinely trying to kill themselves, other people find relief when they cut and don't want to die. It can be hard to tell which by the amount of damage they do.

She told me that lose weight and been anorexic was not about to be slim. But it's a control problem.

I'm miserable and I'm thin.  big ******* deal, i can't sleep at night and i feel overwhelmed all the time.      do you really want to strive for a life like this?  one where you don't want anyone getting too close, because then they'll figure out your dirty little secret or force you to eat?  trust me, it's a lonely hell on this side.  there's nothing glamorous about doing permanent damage to your body at such a young age. there's nothing worse than feeling like you're just a freak because of it. get help now.|`|HxaCFxN1aa	Hey Cortney!

Heres the thing, you need balance in your life, going over the deep in with keeping healthy and staying in check with your weight will only make you sick...    But doing nothing at all, and diving off the deep end the other way will make you sick and bigger.    So what does this mean..    Good well balanced diet  Instead of eating one bigger meal a day eat sevral smaller meals durring the day.  Eating once a day probably means that you are not getting the proper diet.  If you eat a few times a day in a reasonable quantity your body will burn it off easier.  Also breakfeast tends to be the best time to eat the biggest meal as you will have more time durring the day to burn it off.  Do make sure that you are getting enough of all of the food groups, especially dont just give up on cabohydrates like adkins as that is where you get energy from.  When you do have cravings, then eat foods with out carbohydrates as they wont make you gain weight.      I would guess that exercising after you eat is the best time.  Carbohydrates start to break down about a half hour after you eat.  My guess is wait about a half hour then start.      I dont know much about exercising so maybe someone else will have something good to add on that note.    It is also unhealty to loose weight too quick, you are putting yourself in danger!  Find a good healthy diet and exersise program that works for you, and healthy being the key word here.
80ef545ddb07b3917c2e0eb8bd674295aa	If I had to choose between a little weight gain and my peace of mind, I would choose the peace of mind.

9e20cabaf1ecf0acafc3c11e5cd3f3d0aa	I had the surgery in April. I am almost a year post op. I am only 19... I had the Roux en Y... I debated on them both until I went and saw my doctor... After hearing what she explained to me, I chose the Roux En Y... Because the Lap Band had more risks than the Roux En Y did... plus she told me there was chances I couldnt get pregnant with the lap band. I am only 19, couple years younger than you, I know I am going to want kids one day and didnt want that to be a problem. I know quite of few people that has had the gastric bypass that has gotton pregnant. Of corse they have to watch themselves more, so they don't end up gaining the weight back. I have lost around 90 lbs since my surgery. I recently joined a gym and got myself a personal trainer. The surgery was the best thing I ever did, like you I have tried sooo many diets. When my primary doctor told me that I was pre-diabetic, I decided I needed to do something, and chose the surgery. If I had to do it all over again, I would do it in a heartbeat. I didnt have any problems after the surgery and still done... Everything is going great for me... If you would like to know more about the surgery... And how it went, Send me a instant messenger on yahoo... I am online alot, and would love to give you all the info you need on it... My screen name should show up on here.... Good Luck!|`|de3eb11ad0391e687f9759bf44c6b206aa	My sister-in-law had gastric bypass 6 years ago and all though she has lost an incredible amount of weight she has also had several serious medical issues that the doctors attribute to side effects from the surgery.  She has had her bowels twist several times as well as a blockage that led to a rupture. This led to major abdominal surgery.  They did not get all the infection and she ended up with an abcess that nearly killed her.  Despite the weight loss she has not been able to get pregnant.  Stick to a healthy diet and get out there and exercise.  Check out the YOU ON A DIET book.

My cousin got her Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in India. She has lost more than 65 lbs in 5 months and is very happy with the results. The price for obesity surgery is very less in India. My cousin just paid 25% of the cost she was quoted in America. She got her surgery from a company called Forerunners Healthcare.    Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and magazines. I have read a lot of their patient stories also. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low cost, as bariatric surgery and weight loss surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that your Obesity surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.    http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com  Hope this helps.|`|AA11626870	Please, research the possible complications.

Everyone would know you were on them because of your growth and there are other reasons why you don't want to pack on muscle that quickly (not enough bone density to handle the weights, damage to ligaments, stretch marks etc...)  My recommendation would be to eat almost everything you can get your hands on.  I'm talking 5,000 calories a day; mostly lean meats and keep well hydrated.  Lift heavy weights, low reps 4-6 reps.  You can take creatine ethyl ester and possibly a nitric oxide supplement.  Supplement your daily protein intake with muscle milk or whey powder.  Probably about 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight (total...supplements + diet).  If you're taking creatine and lots of protein you have to drink lots of water...maybe 1.5 gallons a day, otherwise you risk damage to your kidneys.

Caffeine : It constricts blood vessels and then when you stop in dilates those vessels and you get a headache. Coffee, coke, chocolate.

Do you smoke? Nicotine constricts your blood vessels as well. <br>  What type of headache is it? Cold/sinus? Does it feel like a hot poker in your eye? Is it only on one side of the head or everywhere? Make a log of when you get the headache as well as everything you do/eat during the day, maybe you'll find a pattern.

lGj86HX5aa	Relax, it is loud,loud and louder. Weird sounds but harmless. Ask your MD for a mild sedative , when you get up after the contrast MRI is over you may be lightheaded. You have a panic button with you at all times and a mirror so you can watch the staff. I have had multiple MRI's of the brain and I can now meditate when I have one, relaxing will make it go faster. It doesn't hurt and it really is not as confining as you think, Think of it as you would a tanning bed and relax.  Let them know, however if you are going to take a benedryl before you go, just to be safe.

Keep reminding yourself, over and over - while you are having the MRI, that the procedure is vitally important and is necessary.       Try to count away the minutes.  One, one thousand, two, one thousand.    While you are having the MRI - think pleasant thoughts about what you are going to do after the procedure.   "Only 20 more minutes and I get to go to the mall."     THESE work|`|YIyHnAu3aa	ive had 2 of these MRI's in the past 2 years...the main thing is always remeber the ends are open and you cna get out if you get claustrophobic while in it..they suually have headphones on you so u listen to music and theyw ill tlak to u at times to make sure your doing fine..youll hear loud and i mean LOUD noises off the wall noises...but its jsut the machine....i counted the noises inbetweeen  the other ones and well i kinda made tunes out of the noises..lmao//i looked in the mirror above my head to comfort myself that yes i cna get out at anytime and yes the ends are open....... the noises is the main issue but youw ill have earplugs to help aid with that...jsut think about sleep or something that makes ya happy it will go fast..... good luck!!the plastic brace they put over my shouldrs an head wasnt bad at all..nothing serious ..simple as a hat|`|e5cc4718c2107c9d52918f08395801f9aa	Check with the doctor if the Benadryl is ok.

385hxPlwaa	That honestly depends on your height and gender. I don't think that weight should matter (this is coming from someone who doesn't even weigh 100 lbs). Fitness should matter. <br>  <br>  If you think that you are over weight, try eating healthy and exercising for 30 minutes a day. You can run, bike, swim, jumprope or go to a gym and take a class (you can take any kind of athletic class...they offer everything from yoga to kickboxing).<br>  <br>  Don't compare yourself to others, you were made unique.|`|b37f2b23a440d20ba2b99b465d00d138aa	call weight watchers - been there and lost 100 pounds in 18 month's.|`|OItPJZjBaa	First off you do not need any kind of diet pill or drink, trust me I did it without any of that crap. Now, 3,500 calories is equal to 1 pound of fat. As far as the diet, you want to eat lots of fruits and veggies, whole grain breads, pastas, and rice. You foods that have lots of fiber, but low in sugar, fat, carbs, and sodium. You will want to stay away from all "white stuff". Now for the exercise, you will have to do cardio, weight lifting, and resistance training. For the weights just start off with anywhere between 2lb. and 8lb. weights. Overtime you should be able to move on to heavier weights. I also recommend keeping a food journal. What you do is you write down everything you eat at what time and how many calories did it contain, because you should be eating every 4 hours. A  good little trick to help you get past those sugar cravings is to chew a piece of Extra sugar free gum.  It has helped me get through some of the toughest times. I hope this has helped you and Best of Luck :)
a84c948571cfa79949f8538ec8f67fa8aa	wow how cool that the garlic helped..i knew it was great stuff but didnt know it could be applied to a wound. I think the best thing now is to let your body do the work now..either with or without bandage/band aid...preferably leaving the wound open to the air..but if there will be risk of infection or it's in an annoying place then with band aid. ..Vitamin E cream is very good at healing and repairing skin as is aloe vera.|`|s28zDVIIaa	I am not aware of the use of garlic as an antiseptic. There are other uses for it such as antihypertension. Repeated use of it may actually irritate the skin. A safer "healer" is aloe vera or pure honey.The body usually fights off infection pretty well. Prescribed antibiotics are very useful. Once redness and swelling has disappeared and the skin is scabbing and healing, let nature take its course. No additional remedy is necessary. Just keep it clean.|`|9AQyHtHHaa	i don't know bout that garlic stuff, but now i would just wash it and put some type of cream and some type bandage.

DQlZIzAFaa	Okay, here's my experience with the rubber bands. They told me to wear them X number of hours X number of days, only take them out to eat, blah blah blah (this was 10 years ago, i barely remember middle school but i remember this lol!). I did it. Exactly like they told me to. And at my next appointment they told me that I had followed their instructions *too* well. They explained that they tell people to wear them ALL the time but because they know preteens and early teens are pretty self-conscious and irresponsible they probably won't wear them. And I ended up having to wear rubberbands for an extra MONTH in the opposite dirrection. I wore them like half the time they told me to and at my next appointment they said I did "perfect." What a load of crap.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying don't wear them, but I am saying they expect you to take them out sometimes. Do sleep with them on at least.|`|D3hLhqR7aa	The more you wear them the more you will get used to them. <br>  Just be sure to wear them as directed because they will know.

Sometimes exercise sucks and I hate to go do it, but I've learned with experience that the endorphin high afterwords makes me feel better and gets me out of the blah state.  That motivates me to suck it up and do it when I don't feel like it.  <br>  <br>  Also, I make lists of things I have to do.  Writing them down relieves stress because I don't have to worry about forgetting something.

Kegel exercises are done to restore muscle tone and strength to the pubococcygeus muscles in order to prevent or reduce pelvic floor problems and to increase sexual gratification. Kegel exercises are said to be good for treating vaginal prolapse and preventing uterine prolapse in women.    Kegel exercises may be beneficial in treating urinary incontinence in both men and women. Kegel exercises are also known as pelvic floor exercises, or simply Kegels.    You can learn to isolate the correct muscles for Kegals by trying to stop a flow of urine after you have started urinating.

Try drinking water the first thing in the morning. Than in the afternoon. Try two in the am and 2 in the pm. It might take away your hunger.Actually we should at least drink 6-8 glasses of water a day.I hope this may help you. Also try not to eat so much starchy food at night.
HGeYmCATaa	Do not try to remove the "coating".  It is your body's way of covering the damage you did to it.  If you are going to try and do anything, wash the wound with warm water and antibacterial soap. when you are done washing, gently pat the area dry, and apply a bacitracin or neosporin ointment.  Cover the wound with a dressing that doesn't stick to skin or a bandaid if it's small enough.  Remove the bandage and repeat the process twice or three times a day.  Check for signs of infection (redness, area feels hot to the touch, feeling sick, pus).  If these occur then go to a physician immediately.  The yellowish clear stuff is ok, green or dark yellow stuff is pus.    When removing the bandages, try soaking the whole area, bandage and all, in warm water before removing them.  You don't want to rip anything that is healing off the wound.|`|AA11662490	colloidal silver is a liquid form of silver which is great for burns and /or infection this should help.

OUbNSXjJaa	For all such things, it is always better to consult a good doctor.|`|AyMg1f9Qaa	I know what you mean.  i have the urge to do things over and over until they feel right too.  As a little kid i used to shut my closet door up to 50 times a night.  it got so bad that i would start to cry.  I feel like that's probably not normal.  i assume i have OCD although ive never gotten it checked out because its embarrassing and hard to explain why i do these weird things over and over.  What you do sounds similar so i would guess that you have it too.  i have since learned to stop ritualizing too, so maybe we just don't have it as severely as some people do?  But some good news, the things i had the urge to do when i was younger have totally gone away.  now however i have the urge to do other random things, but i can easily suppress the urge.|`|Hfv0asa1aa	when i was diagnosed with OCD i had symptoms like yours and the depression also, but medicine and therapy has helped me get through it so you should definitely consult a doctor|`|2ObqoJbKaa	I know how you feel, I do alot of those same things. I think that it is definetly ocd, and probably mixed with a little depression too. I have ocd too, any time you go over something a million times and obsess over things that you shouldn't, thats ocd. You should talk to a doctor or a counselor about that. There are medications that help with ocd, that will make you feel alot better. good luck.|`|5ysJxtdiaa	Some of your symptoms are magical thinking. Magical thinking is when you do a ritual because you want to either prevent of make something happen. THIS IS NORMAL. Now some of your other symptoms may be OCD. Everyone does have a little bit. Try and get a psychologist to help you sort out your feelings. Trust me it helps. If you do have OCD, you are the only one that can control it. You have to tell yourself that "Today is going to be great and I feel energized and nothing is going to stop me from having a great day." Try doing other rituals to try and calm yourself down. Try taking a warm shower, or exercise to help relieve stress. I know it's a hard thing to conquer, but I know you can do this!|`|J7QPNKXfaa	Sounds like OCD to me. It's hard to know how bad it is, though, since I'm not you. But I recommend seeing a doctor before it gets even worse. Especially if it's interfering with your life. You can find tests online to kind of "gauge" it. Don't use a test as a professional diagnosis or anything, though. But they might help you understand yourself a more. I know it's hard to understand but if you try it maybe you'll see what I mean. I had to do a lot of research to understand what I'm going through better. <br>  <br>  Tests:<br>  <a href="http://psychcentral.com/ocdquiz.htm" rel="nofollow">http://psychcentral.com/ocdquiz.htm</a><br>  sanityscore.com

While some research suggests that giving blood might possibly help prevent cancer and heart disease by lowering the body's iron stores, that possibility is tenuous at best. And donating is generally safe, though it occasionally causes nausea, dizziness, or fainting. To minimize those risks, drink lots of fluids and avoid strenuous activity for several hours after donating. And good luck.

j247O1qdaa	well i have had my share of bad luck too. i may not know exactly how you feel but i have an idea. for me personally when life gets to be too much i work on cars. its just something i do to keep busy and not think about what is going on because i have something else to focus on. i also have faith that things happen for a reason. i personally believe in God but i dont go to church every sunday or even live the best of lives and i certainly dont try to change other people. i just do what i can and live my life. if there is something you enjoy go and do it. this cant last forever and some day youll be glad you kept going. the fact that you have hung in there means your a fighter. keep it up. what ever happens just find someone that you can be your self with and talk to comfortably. try to enjoy what you can and know there are some things you can change and some you cant. those you cant just leave alone but those you can try your hardest. i wish you the best of luck and hope things get better. if you want you can contact me at hunter1stshot@yahoo.com.|`|97LPw696aa	i feel bad for you i think you are having bad luck, i am 51 years old and don't think that many bad things ever happened to me all at one time, sometimes i think life is not fair but what can we really do about it? i think you have no choice but to deal with the cards that have been dealt to you. if your money situation is ok maybe you can get some counseling and medical help for your panic attacks, don't blame yourself for things happening that you have absolutely no control over, don't give up thinking bad things are going to keep happening and even if they do make up your mind that you are going to continue to try to overcome these problems, don't even consider giving up. i hope after your fight there will be good times waiting for you|`|AA10627828	No worries mate...Its your head,  not your life.  Thats the Good news.  First lets get a grip about what is good or bad.  In reality...there is no such thing as bad.  Life is LIFE.  not good nor bad.  just is full of ...well Everything.  Our brains are too small to fully comprehend that huge-ness...of all of it.  so,  we "see" things in life as good or bad.  Your life isnt bad.  not even close.  Everything we lable as "bad things"  are actually the events that help to mature us and mold us into better human beings.  Your not having bad luck, rather you are expierencing real life and learning how to deal with unexpected events.  If life was so predictable?  we would be bored and never grow nor learn.  A famous person once said, "problems are only 20%.....80% is how we deal with it....and he was right.  so my advise to you is,  change your mind.  sincerly and good luck to you always...|`|ca27b7f3591b6a841f37f697b88d5f52aa	I have been through the bad streaks too, a few times.

Believe me.|`|mIsFiicwaa	Murphy's Law: anything that can go wrong will go wrong. Dale Carnegie wrote in his book "Stop Working and Start Living", "once you hit bottom there is only one way to go and that is up." Personally I believe that all of us possess the potential to go through many bad incidences and the person who persists may keep spiraling downwards emotionally until they have reached (learned) a new realm of thought and it is then that that person flourishes with greater happiness and understanding, it is then this person has more to offer others also. Material goods can always be replaced, mental and physical health is utmost importance until you get through this time of your life- exercise and eat well when you least feel like doing so and refuse to be defeated.|`|6c36d58807f23e54312ea99cf1344127aa	hello my friend, I am so sorry for what you are going through. The last 10 years of my life were horrific, mostly because of my bad choices and not listening to my intuition. Once I started to let go of the nonessential things and people in my life, things got a little better. Then I started being proactive about my life and my future, things got a whole lot better. I also realized that I can not save everyone, and I can not be everything to everybody. It also sounds as if you have a difficult time dealing with stress, both internal and external. And it might help you to know that in life, we as humans are going to suffer hardships, illnesses and eventually death. It is all a part of the cycle of life. Life is good, but it also has it's opposites. Your inner strength comes from how you cope with the hard times and your appreciation of the good. I hope this encourages you.

a0c102b8ca14a50e8e38a99b46dd5505aa	How much of this problem is your doctor aware of?  He/she might be your best resource for you.  Sounds like maybe you've gone into a vicious cycle, and need help to find a way out.    Other than that, I can't think of too much.  Warm milk.  Relaxing bath before bedtime.  A very dull book.    Lay down, close your eyes.  If sleep occurs, great.  If not, don't lay there and toss and turn all night.  Get back up for an hour or so.    Definitely, discuss this with your doctor.    kiwi|`|4850e5aa95547da3d96085c4f820c7f6aa	I have Hapatitis-C and one of the major symtoms of it is  insomnia.  Like you, I tried all kinds of 'over the counter' sleep aids  but none worked.  With my illness I cannot, nor would not take any drugs of any kind  so I opted for the natural approach.  I started taking 3 to 5 milligrams of Melatonin, a natural substance  our bodies produce to induce sleep. But for some reason or other  our bodies sometimes do not produce enough of it, usually from  stree, illness, etc.  For the first time in over a year I now get a good nights sleep.  Melatonin makes you a little drowsy so be careful not to take it too soon before bed.  I suggest taking it 1 hour before bedtime.  IT WORKS!!!|`|5f196ca61261ca726675bb2e54d95827aa	Hi Alicia,  First of all start using blue color bedsheets and try to read something on bed before you go to sleep, also please do some physical work in the day time. you can also go for some music specially Mozart.|`|5bf9b8d43814dc2a572dcd9ef1a006cbaa	try hylands nerve tonic you can get it at walmart on the vitamin aisle
646ee371438584fbf3c385ec7a7db711aa	You should make a full disclosure of any prescription medicine you take before you sign for the drug screen.  You are covering yourself by offering this information so there are no surprises when the results come back to the company you are seeking employment with.  The company has legal right to decide not to hire you if the medicine you are taking could pose a problem with safety concerns and issues with how well you could or could not perform a specific job.  However, my advice to you is to inform the prospective employer that you are under doctors orders for this medication and the longevity of which you have taken the medicine and explain prior to the drug screen how the medicine does or does not affect you abilities.  Good luck.|`|81a0b098f9099d8797ab4a8d44eb3c2baa	I guess that as long as you disclose this there is nothing they can do expecially since the doctor perscribed it.|`|AA11262612	Tell them up front.

As long as you have a valid doctor's prescription they should except that. Use of xanax is not a "disability", in which case you are not protected by law, so yes they can to refuse to hire you.  Future employers are going to be concerned that you can perform your job withouth serious impairment, 4 mg/day of xanax will definitely raise concerns.
AA11509898	this sounds a lot like a bladder infection. I've had those several times and they are not pleasant. You can go to Planned parenthood (if you don't have insurance or $$ for a doctory) and they can do a quick pee test to see if you have a UTI (same as a bladder infection). If you do, they will treat it with antibiotics and you can buy Uristat which will turn your pee bright orange but will also numb your bladder (which will make you wanting to pee go away). In the future though, I recommend drinking a little bit before sex and then peeing right after sex.

Also, community members held a couple of benefits for him that helped off-set costs.  He TRIED to apply for medicaid, but was denied (good luck with that)...but it's worth a shot.

tXs2meLPaa	www.slimmingworld.com|`|I54KyS8Laa	You didn't give your height or weight so how can we tell if you are really overweight or just having a self image crisis? <br>  If you are self conscious like most teens are, most out grow of it by the mid 20's. What this means is that your problem is not weight, it's that you are too concerned about what you think others will think of you. <br>  <br>  The best thing is to start reading books about self image psychology. An old stand-by is Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz. Should be in any library or you can get it on Amazon for about fifty cents. Everyone should read it at some point in their lives--just skip over the parts that are a bit advanced for you and focus on the stuff he says about self consciousness and being happy. <br>  <br>  Then if you actually have extra pounds do the following:<br>  Breakfast:<br>  An egg with whole grain bread or your half cup of oatmeal, millet is also great. <br>  Lunch--whole grain bread with almond or cashew butter and a piece of fruit.. or can of sardines in water or tomato sauce--no peanuts as they have mold and a lot of people are really allergic and don't know it. <br>  Dinner--salad without dressing--flavor with oregano, cracked pepper, salt (Morton lite salt), crushed red pepper, small amount of nuts...<br>  one serving of chicken, fish, turkey, or pork--stay away from deli meats--they're high in salt. Do not drink diet drinks--they actually make you gain weight. No carbonated drinks either because they mess up your calcium balance. Use stevia as a sweetener. Back to dinner--definitely a vegetable like broccoli, green beans, collard greens, carrots, and small serving of potatoes, sweet potatoes or rice.<br>  For twenty-six free pointers on nutritional eating to drop weight go to<br>  <a href="http://dstressdoc.com/Articles/LoseWeight1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://dstressdoc.com/Articles/LoseWeigh...</a>|`|RZ72YJGCaa	Just eat healthy<br>  like lots of fruits and veggies.<br>  Exercise about 40 minutes to an<br>  hour.You can walk or jog or whatever<br>  as long as your moving.Avoid eating past<br>  6 or 4 hours before you go to bed.Eat less sugar,<br>  and eat things with low fat contents.<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  :)|`|jgFd1df7aa	How much do yu weigh?<br>  <br>  Won't answer until I know that, we could be telling you tips when yur at an average weight.<br>  <br>  Soo?<br>  X

MYdxuJHxaa	Reps = Repetitions = How many times in a row you perform the action.    Sets = Number of completed repetitions.    ---  For example, using your example, you would do 12 repetitions, rest for some short period of time, and perform another 12 repetitions.  This would give you 2 sets of 12 reps.      The reason they are broken up in sets is because you get more "bang for your buck" if you did twelve, gave your body a couple minutes to recover and then did twelve more compared to attempting to do 24 all at once.  It also gives you the ability to do more strenuous work by doing it in repeatable short bursts, or "sets".|`|5630d4348c8138364f50b0930700a2a9aa	It just means that you do the number of reps is how many time you do the exercise like crunchers, situps, pushups, etc. and when you do multiple sets it's how many times you perform those reps, take a breather, and start again.

If you are not eating a healthy amount of food, then yes you should increase your eating (in a healthy manner).

You will feel better about yourself and you wont feel like you overdid it.Hope this helps.    If all your doing is exercising and not dieting, try gathering some pictures of people you see in magazines that you would like to look like body wise. Look at them whenever you feel less motivated to workout.

Because regardless of your height, you are dangerously underweight if you mean 62 pounds. If you DO mean pounds, you need to get medical and mental help. Your family and friends need mental help as well for not trying to help you sooner.     Assuming you are speaking in metric terms, first thing you need to consider is how tall you are...  from 5'5" to 5'10" (1.6m to 1.8m) you are within you normal weight range. Shorter than 5'5" and you are overweight. Taller than 5'10" you are underweight.|`|07753a3838a350ee344fa2ad1b5ccc6aaa	First of all you're only 21! You need to consider your height, if you're quite tall then 62kg really isn't much.  You should also bear in mind that if you're toned then the weight shouldn't matter because muscle weight weighs more than fat.  Don't crash diet because your body can't adjust properly and you WILL gain more fat after the crash diet, when you eat normally again.      You can easily lose weight by being more active and eating healthily and the odd junk food won't kill you.  If you don't like the idea of going to a gym, why don't you and some friends go to an indoor rock climbing club, play ball games in a park or swimming just to name a few ideas, as long as you have an interest to keep you motivated.

R6aEKosmaa	Usually it is detected before there are symptoms when a lump is found.  The symptoms can be practically anything; however structural changes of the breast are most often noticed and what brings someone to the doctors...like the breast having an orange (the fruit not the color) skin appearance, nipple discharge, lump in breast, under arm, etc..  Do monthly self exams, see a doctor, get an all clear from the doctor and then start your self exams...get familiar with your breasts and what is the "normal" feel, you will then better be able to notice changes.  Breast tissue can feel lumpy, also women can have a benign disorder call fibrocystic breast disease (the breasts will be very lumpy but not cancerous), a cancerous lump is usually something that will feel like a solid nodule under the skin.  When examining the breasts make sure you go all the way up under the arms; breast tissue can be spread up into the armpits.  I have known a couple people with breast cancer and their symptoms were just a lump in the breast detected by them through self exams.  Chemo and radiation are difficult to go through so see your doctor regularly and do monthly self exams and while your at it...get a mirror out and get to know your vagina as well.  I think women neglect this area of their body because of embarrassment.  There are health issues with the vaginal area too and it can take a lot of stress off your mind if you know what the baseline is.  My sister had skin cancer on her pubic region almost in her vaginal area.  It really is important to know your body, that includes knowing the moles on you as well...look at your back too.  Heck go stand in a full length mirror with a handheld mirror and give yourself the once over.  Make it a regular habit and that way when you notice a change you can get it taken care of before it is late in the disease.  I haven't had much experience with breast cancer in my patients, so can only speak from personal experience and a little bit from my nursing lectures.  I hope this helps...if not you, someone!  Take care|`|065b430f4b4b9a58a8c14fa3b764d8c1aa	The symptoms can be just about anything.  But no one wants to wait for symptoms.    The best things that you can do for yourself are to learn to do a monthly breast self exam (and do it) and to have a regular screening mammogram.  Talk with your doctor about both.|`|f10ebdaf0188ca166507aae70c628222aa	usually a lump is the first sign and often its too late to avoid surgery, thats why you need a test, but they dont really suggest them till about 40 so do the manual test every month, if you dont know about it go to planned parenthood and ask for information.|`|uI7R3uDpaa	swollen lumps in the breast, malformed nipple when it is more advanced, can have some weaping from the nipple as well. The growth will only be detected when it first starts by laying down and raising your arm above your head. Take the other hand and carefully feel/massage the breast in small circular motions under, in and around the breast. Then also check towards the armpit as the lumps can extend into the lymph nodes in the armpit. Small very tiny lumps are not an issue as a rule, as everyone has tiny lumps...it is when they are more easily felt that you start to watch them...and if they get larger, get to the doctor! Or of course you observe other things like the weeping or malformed nipple...|`|de5926afee215d6ac06a65320b0cca1baa	Usually symptom free until it is at a very late stage then that is a problem as it is hard to cure at that point. Get you breasts examined by the dr make sure you know how to do it yourself. If you are at the right age get a mammogram as directed by the dr. If you are at any age and have pain in your breast discuss it with your DR. It is not a light matter. Breast cancer kills men and women.  For more info go to the american cancer society web site.

That's a muslim name. If you are muslim than you should know that intercourse is only for reproduction, and it is not for the Husband's pleasure-it is the wife's. And You should only use Viagra with the consent of the wife! Otherwise it's Haraam! Any Male Enhancement Supplements are Haraam, Without the Consent of the wife! So you should be ashamed to be posting this on the internet! It doesn't matter what other Mushrikeen say! Take it from the Imaam from your local Masjid/Mosque. (or an islamic view)    "In the Qur'an, sex before marriage is strictly prohibited. Islam stresses that sexual relations should be restricted to the institution of marriage in order for the creation of the family; and secondly as a means to protect the family, certain relations should be considered prohibited for marriage. Islam recognises that sex is enjoyable and makes no prohibitions on sex for pleasure (between a husband and wife). In fact being available for, and pleasuring, your spouse is a duty on both the husband and wife. Fornication and adultery are both included in the Arabic word 'Zina'. Belonging primarily to the same category of crimes, entailing the same social implications and having the same effects on the spiritual personality of a human being, both, in principle, been given the same status by the Qur'an.    In Shiite Islam, the concept of a temporary marriage exists. This kind of marriage can be just for "fulfillment", as many will say primarily for a sexual relationship."|`|f343e598d2cfa245a67aefc3b78f8d37aa	Hi Waqas,    it's important to inform yourself first before buying any wrong solution. Viagra, Cialis etc. contain chemical ingredients which are harmful to your body, simply cause they are not natural. Anyone telling you Viagra is harmless is blatantly lying or simply uninformed. (incl. doctors)    Pills are in so far recommended, provided they only contain natural herbs, fresh and of pure quality, which indeed do help to better the blood flow in your penis, make you "stand" longer and enable you have sex more often. That's not a secret at all since it's proven that some exotic herbs (e.g. Amla, Arjuna and others) can not only "stimulate" the mood of both, women and men, but also the libido and make both HOT & horny :-)    Your best bet by far would be to check out:    http://usefulresources.info/prosolution....    It is completely natural and safe. As far as I know it's the only product which is endorsed by both, doctors and herbalists.     It brings very good results and that's what only counts for me!

Pv4w0YVnaa	First you need to shave your head....   Sorry, kidding.    Once you start shaving, it just grows thicker, better, faster until eventually you are sorry you ever started.    Good luck    Cheers  :-)|`|AA12275511	If you want a relatively accurate way of telling before you start growing a beard is to look at the other side of your family tree.  The gene for hairiness is found to be passed through the mother, so if you have furry uncles in your mother's side of the family, then there's a good possibility that you would be furry too.  Leg hair and armpit hair aren't really good indicators, but that does say that you have a fairly large amount of testosterone, which is a requirement for growing facial hair (but that's not exactly good news since that also means the hair on top of your head is bound to fall off).  At 21, you are still bound to get hairier, so don't sweat it if it doesn't come fast enough, there's a certain rate at which you grow hairier, and that's usually dictated by genetics.        Continually shaving will thicken the hair shaft, but it won't accelerate growth or spread, i don't recommend shaving everyday, this will lead to rashes and irritation as the sharp points of the newly shaved hairs try to poke through the raw skin.  It hurts like hell.  Hair thickens with age, as the hair follicles mature, and it doesn't need constant shaving.  About every other day or every three days will be best.|`|AA11274090	they will probably get more coarse, just keep shaving, those whispy hairs grow when you're in puberty and thicken up evertime you shave... try it, might now be more hair (which is a myth) but they do get thicker.|`|hwVYB84Haa	It is one of the few things that will grow without watering, just at different rates for different people

Too many people try to make drastic changes in their lifestyle by eating very healthy and/or exercising a lot.  If you just make it a gradual transition into a more healthy lifestyle, you'll last longer and get more out of it.    For example, if you always go out to eat, stop ordering burgers and fries and start ordering grilled chicken and a baked potatoe/macaroni salad.  Switch from processed to whole grain foods.  And start eating more fruits and vegetables.    As far as exercising, join a gym or start lifting weights 3 times a week.  Try riding your bike or jogging a few times a week too.

Although the effectiveness of the shot will not be altered, your body may take a few months to adjust to the shot. You may experience some major changes such as breast tenderness and weight changes, don't worry about it, just give it time.

4YJYxZrxaa	Diarrhea can be almost immediate (I know, people always say it's the day or 2 before, but I have experienced this), especially if it's a food allergy or sensitivity.  It's good to eliminate the most frequent allergens  for a week, (milk, wheat, eggs) and add one at a time, like milk, and see if you react to it.  You may have a larger reaction after having eliminated it, so it's more obvious.  You could take your pulse before eating, and then 15 minutes after eating the "new" food.  If it changes more than 7, you may have an allergy.  If it changes 12 or more, you are very likely to have an allergy to that food (according to the doctor I worked for-make no mistake, I am not a doctor).  Mine changed 20!  Some people's pulse goes up, some down.|`|5eaca491be6e0a0d3c6841df87b5df95aa	Well the food you just ate can cause your stomach to hurt and make you have diarrhea but its the food you ate yesterday that you are pooing ...

044c7b0231ff7ed1296bce9aa26877a9aa	pushups are good if you don't want to go to the gym.  but if you do go to the gym, try free weights - like dumbbells.  chest presses, or dumbbell flys are REALLY good.  make sure you do it correctly though, just because you are lifting heavy weights, it won't give you the good results.  lifting just enough to make you work hard and doing the right technique will give you the right results.    as for the flat stomach.  I highly reccommend pilates.  if you know of a good instructor you should take them.  usually the good ones have their own studios, mine does, and she also teaches at our local community college.|`|AakDEbwwaa	Pushups are great. Dips are also good. And if you're strong enough to do the wheel, that will also work your chest, along with shoulders and back, while also giving you a nice trim tummy. If you can't do the wheel, try this:  From a standing position, bend down and walk your hands forward. Once your back is straight (parallel to the floor) hold the position for a few seconds--work up to a minute or two. Then walk back. If you can hold for a minute, you're probably ready for the wheel.

SwP3tE2Uaa	If you don't eat for a week, you are going to binge, hopefully not at the party.  Then all the weight loss will be wasted.    Instead eat healthily with lots of veggies, lean meat and complex carbs and exercise, you will not have problem losing some fats and weight.      Eat these at the party too.  You will stay slim at the party and  your whole life.     I am on low carb, low fat, high fibre, high protein and a hour brisk walk 5 times a week, and I have lost 31lbs and gain better health.

D09yBYJ2aa	No it can not affect when her period will start. However female sex hormones or rather the urge to plesure yourself is higher before you start your period and if you have a normal cycle of 28 days (the first day being the first day of your period) it would also be around day 14 that your hormone levels are at their highest. Your period is just your body's way of getting rid of the egg you did not use that month becouse it wasnt fertilised by sperm. It has nothing to do with when you will get your period. Remember once you get your period you for all intensive perposes are able to concieve a baby so protection should be used if you are having intercorce with a Boy/Man. Hope this clears things up for you. Enjoy your body and respect it.|`|AA11372183	I dont think it has anything to do with that. no.

You have to be careful as to the shade and what not, but if you get the right one for your skin tone and do it carefully, no one should notice. I am however glad you are no longer cutting.

KqHPUmdsaa	I reccomend going to the bookstore, finding a book called the Abs Diet..the weight lifting plan is close to what you are looking for. The author is editor imn cheif of Men's magazine I think. Whey protein is great for afterworkouts, but make sure it's whey protein isolate. If it is Whey protein concentrate...wel that's fine, but just not as much protein and blah blah w/e. Protein is cheaper ordering online by the way.  Check out Miceller Casein protein...if you like it it's best 45min before working out. If you want to get back in shape, limit the calories. With your training in mind I would say you may need anywhere from 1800-2000 calories per day. Mayve 1900-2200 when you workout intensly.  If you want to do cardio and weight lift, it's best I believe to do the weight lifting first, then cardio.|`|9nElIoMiaa	Use the protein shake after the workout.

84c1eeee8af02f2bbe9fe13a280b03a3aa	1. Keep a Food Journal  This will help you become aware of what and HOW MUCH you eat.  2a. Read food labels  2b. Portion control your meals.  Measure all your food. From home cooking, snacks, even fast food. For example a large bag of chip, if you grab a bunch of chips or eat straight out of the bag you don't realize that you've had several serving of chips ( a serving could only be 8 chips).  3. Exercise.  Just walking for 20-30 minutes a day is the easiest way to start your workout routine. Then as you become stronger start adding variety to your cardio (change the intensity & increase the duration ) and include strenght training (2x a week).  4. Set a long term goal as well as short term goals. For example:  Your long term goal is to lose 20+lbs.  Your short term goal could be to lose 5 lbs in 2 weeks.  Just update your short term goals once you reach them and don't forget to reward yourself ( new workout outfit, mani/pedi,new walking shoes, etc)    Remember to that everyone loose weight at a different rate, the more you weight the faster you (could possibly) lose the weight, you need to make the effort and detication to change your body.    Good Luck!|`|88cc42d17441ae118bb2441adf8938cbaa	First of all. 15-20lbs in a few weeks is kinda pushing it. All you'll be loosing is water and it wont be permanent weight loss. Even 10lbs in a few weeks isn't very healthy. (500x7=3500) 3500=1Pound. So eating 1000Cal's a day will give you a 2lbs loss in a week. (your body burns Cal's to keep you alive) - Around 2000 of them (usually) If you exercise in the morning before you eat you are more likely to burn fat. If you have a high carb diet then you have to burn off the excess carbs before you can burn the fat. At around 20min's of a cardio workout (jogging, running, cycling, swimming...anything that gets your heart rate up) you will use up those carbs and start to burn fat. That's why they say you should workout for about 45mins+. (That's also why you shouldn't eat a high carb dinner late at night = more carbs to burn tomorrow) If you burn 500cal from exercise everyday then you will loose 3lbs a week. Have 3 meals a day with 2 snacks in between to keep your metabolism running smooth and combined with exercise you should be burning fat in no time!|`|Jbr1UquLaa	The faster you lose weight the quicker you'll put it back on.    Going out for daily runs or even walks will help you.  But 15-20 pounds in a few weeks isn't going to happen.

6kUx7fwcaa	Respiratory problems are significant comorbid illnesses that go with diabetes.  My doctor and pulmonologist highly recommend getting the flu vaccine every year.  People with diabetes are on the priority list to get the vaccine, or at least I am because I have had several cases pf pneumonia and many asthma problems.  I would highly recommend that your father see an allergist and pulmonologist (many allergists are also pulmonologists) and be evaluated ESPECIALLY if he has had any upper respiratory problems in the past.  There are medications to help prevent more serious problems and there are things you need to learn to prevent them, like the warning signs of possible problems from overexertion or overexercise or exercising in bad conditions.  Exercise, however, regularly is very important.  New guidelines say walking for 45 min. to an hour a day, even in separate 10 or 15 minute blocks of time is extremely important.  I am going to be 54 and I want to live for my children, who are still young and have at least 14 years before the last one graduates from college.  We do not know how tenuous life can be.  I don't want to be frightening, but with diabetes, the problems come at you gradually, and then suddenly you are confronted with the ultimate question, and you may not even be aware of the moment.  I speak from experience.  There was a time when I did not realize it, but people thought they were attending my death bed.|`|zEHU0E9Yaa	Influenza vaccines are created each year by companies that break apart strains of influenza virus that they believe will affect the geographic region in the upcoming season.    Those viral "bits" that are no longer functioning (note I did not say "living"...viruses are not living organisms as they have no means of reproducing on their own) are now more readily recognized by the person's immune system and the system tends to react to the viral threats more quickly.    HOWEVER:    There is a large number of extenuating circumstances that affect the efficacy of the treatment. If a person's immune system is not up to snuff because of diet, stress, or other disease then the immune system will not be able to respond suitably anyway.    If the strain of influenza the person contracts is strongly dissimilar (viruses mutate quickly and there is no such thing as an all-inclusive viral vaccine) then the immune system will not have the information necessary to make the "rapid response" that it would be able to if it recognized the strain.    Finally, there is no such thing as "permanent relief" from influenza. There are so many strains and they mutate so quickly that the only real relief that can be provided is seasonal.
d2a0990475e0f667c5ad93ab48d28197aa	1)  Yes there is a genetic history.  2) Other factors include:  experiencing high stress situations and lack of sleep or a poor sleep cycle  3) Women are more likely to be diagnosed Bipolar  4) Age at first symptoms    In terms of genetics, there are a few things to understand.  First the above person is incorrect.  Please also understand that this kind of predicting of risk is very inexact.  For example, on study says if one parent only has it, with no other information to go on, the risk to a child is around 20%.  Another expert in this field says 10% for that scenario (Berretini, Medscape 2003), and another website on this very topic says 5%.

I know your life seems like an exception. It isn't.    Extreme stress can cause a breakdown.  Breakdowns would be even more likely if you have a constant but subtle stress in the background, caused by habitual resistance to what is happening.    So if you want to avoid stress just surrender the resistance to what is happening.  You still act when necessary in situations you won't allow.

5c14ce29a8e8722c87d3ce6bc2135af5aa	YOu have an immune system. It is a bunchof foods you ewat along with nerves and chemicals inyour body and you bodies ability tomake various chemicals.    This is your immune system. The same immune system that heals your body and repairs it daily is the same system that allows ytou to cope with stress. So stress and the immnune system are intertwined.  The best way to have a strong immune system is to eat lots and lots of fresh fruit and raw vegetables daily.  Then to excercise.  Walk swim are two good ones but so is moving your artms around and your legs whhile you watch you favirite shows and things. Activity is healthy.   read about my worlds's best breakfast and then realize everything in there is about making your immune system strong.

Cortisol (the main stress hormone) would rise, which would result in an overabundance of glutamate, which in turn would result in mood instability, once this occurs GABA levels would decrease resulting in a lower threshold of fear and anxiety. Once this is going on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is now out of balance as adrenaline and noradrenaline levels start to rise in the CNS. If this stress continues enough time, the brain will begin to lower it's catecholamines, such as serotonin and dopamine, so the brain won't be using up all of it's energy on stress. When this is happening, the brain is restructuring itself to function at a lower metabolic rate, this is known as depression.|`|4kSGxT0daa	Click below to read more about it.
lfnjwpu1aa	Not my field but this is what I found: Clinically, Jami's vu is used for a moment of perceptual disconnection from memory when the familiar seems unfamiliar. One loses ones past in the eternal now and all seems new. It is a mystical moment of temporal anomaly or temporary amnesia.     In its psychological usage Jami's Vu is defined by using its partner dj vu as a referent but the concept can stand and be defined on its own in a broader context on the world stage.      The term Jamais Vu was coined by an American, Joseph Heller, in his break-out novel Catch-22. In fact the way that the word is used in terms of the group mind is that it is a NOVEL EVENT, the completely original, unprecedented and hence, unpredictable circumstance.  the FIRST GLIMPSE of what may later be copied  or imitated but a Jamais Vu Event can never be repeated, it is the anti-thesis of Dj vu!

I once met a person with severe alcoholism at an institution for people with mental illness.  I used to give him a cigarette when I saw him.  I would light the cigarette.  He would aways ask, "What's your name?  Nice weather we are having." The  he would turn away scanning the room. Then he would face me again, act very surprised, and say, "Hello.  What's your name? Nice weather we're having."  Just an anecdote to demonstrate the point.  He acted like he never saw me before and he would do the same thing as long as I sat there.

6kUx7fwcaa	Progressive mescular relaxation traininging involves the tensing of individual musce groups and then allowing them to relax for a time.  You tense them for about five, ten, or 15 seconds at a time and release them for the same time, starting with your feet calves, thighs, and moving up the body; or you can start from the top and move down.  When finished you have a wonderful sense of relaxation.  Autogenic relaxation is often called passive concentration.  There are many techniques some using bio-feedback, the use of a machine to measure a bodily function like pulse rate, blood pressure, or electroencephalograph.  Some are very similar to forms of meditation, such as the Relaxation Response made famous by Benson, which is nothing more than a Zen-Hindu form breathing meditation (in Hindu, Anaparana, I believe, or something like that, can't remember the spelling).  Autogenic relaxation may also be the listening to music, usually soft music, or chants, or saying affirmations or listening to a tape of affirmations.  There are many different forms.  I like it the best. I can see how this form of relaxation can increase attention and concentration and help you to focus and control thoughts, because you are not supposed to focus on any particular thought while you do it; you are supposed to let every thought go and clear your mind.  Emptying your mind creates a vessel that is receptive to all forms of other ideas, including peace.  In the non-meditation world, if you are stuck on a problem and have a mental block, clearing your mind can make you open for the solution to enter.  This type of relaxation allows you to become the master of your mind and gain better control of your thoughts.  It is a scientifically proven way to improve many different mental problems, as an essential tool in the arsenal, and is part of what is now call "Mindfulness" in Cognitive Behavior Therapy.  It helps with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, post traumatic stress disorders, and others.  I could go on and on about it, but I will stop here.  I have recommended these techniques elsewhere on Yahoo! Answers.  There are people who say more on other web sites.

6kUx7fwcaa	Aversion therapy would not work for diabetics.  People who have diabetes have problems with more than just sweets.  The idea that you have to check your "sugar level" often leads people to believe that diabetics only have to worry about sugar.  Once you stop eating sugar, diabetics just move on to other things, like bread, pizza, pasta.  Anything with wheat or any carbohydrates will increase sugar (glucose) levels.  Almost all food turn into glucose so the body can assimilate it into cells as nutrients.  If you want to see how well aversion therapy works on foods, look up studies on Antabuse that is used to curb alcoholism (another big glucose make).|`|14ad394512d542c10b924db2e8b09cb7aa	I'm a diabetic who gets sick after eating sweets.

zEHU0E9Yaa	For operant conditioning, the subject is presented with a discriminative stimulus (Sd) and they then must perform a task to receive reinforcement. If they do not know how to perform the task then their behavior must be shaped until they can perform the task.    The task is typically either one where behavior is rewarded after a set number of responses or a set amount of time.    An example of the set number of responses would be "do your homework". When given the Sd (told to do homework), the subject must then engage in the "doing homework" behavior (proper study habits) in order to get a reward (approval and grades.) If there is no Sd, then the subject will not have the occasion set to do his homework. If he does not have appropriate "doing homework" behavior then his behavior must be shaped so that he does. Once reinforcement begins it will encourage further "doing homework" behavior until finally the behavior is automatic.    An example for set amount of time would be the case of a person who feels they snack too much in-between meals. For this, specific meal-times can be set, in which case the clock becomes the Sd. The reward can be something enjoyable at the end of the day, provided that the schedule was followed, even a "snack"!     Of course, there are many more examples and conditions (particularly Wanchisen's concepts of "conditioning history") but those would be two typical applied examples of everyday life.|`|2662bff905d732c360e759fb500fa522aa	The same techniques of behavior modification that can be used by teachers to manage student behavior in the classroom can also be used by supervisors to alter the behavior of teachers. In both cases, it is necessary for the supervisors and teachers to focus primarily on the individual's behavior itself, rather than on what causes that behavior. To modify behavior, the teachers and supervisors must determine what response or type of behavior they wish to reinforce in the individual. The two types of response conditioning used to produce behavior modification are respondent conditioning and operant conditioning. Operant conditioning examines the relationship between an individual's behavior and his environment and attempts to understand the behavior through knowledge of the factors that modify the behavior. Both positive and negative reinforcement are used in operant conditioning to produce the desired behavioral response. Two other methods that teachers and supervisors can apply are (1) shaping or successive approximation, which is used to create a behavior that does not exist or to strengthen one that is not apparent, and (2) contingency contracting, which requires the teacher or supervisor to make a contract with the student under which rewards are promised in return for desired learning behavior.|`|aIfY6BMBaa	I looked this technique up because I had no heard of it before  http://people.eku.edu/palmerj/200/operan...

PO9hxdvyaa	Dihydrocodeine, also called DHC and Paracodeine and by the brand names of Synalgos DC, Panlor DC, Panlor SS, SS Bron, Drocode, Paracodin, Codidol, Didor Continus, Dicogesic, and DF-118 amongst others, is a semi-synthetic opioid analgesic prescribed for postoperative pain, severe dyspnea, or as an antitussive. Dihydrocodeine tartrate is also present in co-dydramol. In some countries, controlled-release dihydrocodeine and/or the immediate release forumulations are used as an alternative to methadone in treatment of opioid dependency and addiction.    Commonly available as tablets, solutions, elixirs, and other oral forms, dihydrocodeine is also available in some countries as an injectable solution for deep subcutaneous and intra-muscular administration. Intravenous administration could be dangerous due to pulmonary oedema and the potential of anaphylaxis as it is with codeine. At one time in the past and possibly now, dihydrocodeine suppositories also existed.

BdicrbXwaa	Depending on how old your brothers are, they should look up "Alcoholics Anonymous" in the local phonebook and call the main number and find out where there are meetings for either Alanon [for family members of alkies] or Alateen [for younger family members of alkies] and go to meetings and listen up to people in the same boat.  They will find great comfort and help from others who have been on the same road.  The first thing they will learn is that an alcoholic has to get to the worst last moment [this is called "hitting bottom"] before they can get scared & crazy enuf to stop drinking and start going to AA meetings.  It has to come from THEM, not from worried family members.  Alanon and Alateen will help your brothers cope and give them tools to work with.  Ditto for you, 2000 miles away and all--go to an Alanon meeting and find someone near your own age to talk with.  Nothing lonelier in the whole world than the family of a drinking alky, and nobody needs friends more than those guys.  Don't go it alone!

I know that you would like to change this situation, but you really can't.  Like myself, your mother has to be the one to decide that she would like to change.  You cannot control that.  You can only control you.  Just do all you can to take care of yourself so that you can be there for her when and if your mom does decide that she needs help.|`|ifJHS7aiaa	If your mother is an alcoholic...she obviously needs some help.  You need to find a way to get someone you trust, with patience to talk to her.  Alcoholism is serious, and is not only damaging to those around her, but could seriously affect her health.  Her relationship with an alcoholic, is as toxic as what she's drinking.  First step-Talk to someone about her problem. Step 2-Sit down with her and tell her how you feel.  Step 3-Show her your love and support continuously, and let her know that you wont give up on her!|`|3m0EwdnKaa	Once an alcoholic always an alcoholic. It is a disease that needs to be controlled. Sounds like your mother is in its grasp again. While you can't convince her to stop until she chooses to you can get your siblings in an al-anon or alateen program to help them cope. Go to www.al-anon.alateen.org for more information  You can't save your mother from herself. The best you will be able to do is try to get your brothers in a more stable environment. Can you maybe speak to your father about custody? Whatever happens to your mom is going to happen with or without your brothers around. It would be best to get them to an emotionally and physically safe place. Even if you are 2000 miles away they are lucky to have someone who cares. Kudos to you!

AZbnuQGFaa	well diet and exercise are always talked about, but first you need to find out how quick your metabolism is (the speed your digestive system breaks down your food) if you want to speed up your metabolism which is good when losing weight, then eat (healthy food such as fruit, cereal, yogurt, dessert once in a while...) less meals a day like maximum of 3, and cut down the amount of food. (anytime you drink liquids alone, does not count as a meal). after a good breakfast you should exercise and exercise less intensly in the afternoon good luck|`|AA11563604	well, i suppose. stop exercising, eat junk food, then your weight will be plenty loose and will jiggle around when you touch it.|`|uWMmzyrGaa	Diet and exercise.

Eat low fat meats, lots of veggies and most importantly, drink ATLEAST 64 ounces of water a day.  Water helps clean out  your system and flush fat out.  Also, do some type of exercise 3-4 times a week, such as walking, or bikes.  Another good tip is do not eat after 630 at night or else what you eat will not have enough time to properly digest and burn off.  With all these changes going on simultaneously, your body will be in shape before you know it!  Good luck!|`|AX2KTBbQaa	Just stop eating, thats what celebs do!!!

Il est indispensable aussi d'accompagner ce type de traitement par un suivi psychologique (psychologue) et rgulirement (au moins une fois tous les 10 jours).

J'ai senti une toute lgre baisse mais mon tat me convenait alors je ne suis pas retourne voir le mdecin et depuis je me sens trs bien (aujourd'hui j'ai 22 ans)... je suis contente que ca se soit pass de cette manire et je n'ai pas ressenti du tout de dpendance...Comme toi je suis une vraie marmotte et on me qualifie souvent de Suisse pour ma lenteur ! lol ! mais je n'ai pas ressenti du tout d'effets indisirables a ce niveau... aprs chacun ragi diffremment aussi ...

Il existe des psychologies "biographiques" qui aident  comprendre pourquoi on en est arriv l en regardant sa propre biographie.  Il y a galement des mdecines holistiques (souvent pratiques par des homopathes, mais il y en an peut-tre d'autres) qui essayent de prendre en compte l'ensemble des facteurs physiques, mentaux, psychologiques, sociaux, etc., pour tacher de rsoudre vraiment un pb, et pas le gommer temporairement avec un peu de prozac...

Si tu es vraiment mal, il faut que tu commences  les prendre maintenant car leurs effets n'agit qu'au bout de 3-4 semaines. En attendant, je te conseille de consulter un psychiatre. Il pourra trouver le traitement rellement adapt  ton psychisme (les diffrents antidpresseurs ont des molcules diffrentes qui n'agissent pas de la meme manire selon les personnes).   Quand  la phrase maladroite de ton mdecin "ptit vlo dans la tte", je pense que c'est tout simplement pour que tu cesses de te mettre la tete en vrac pour un oui ou pour un non (ce qui arrive quand on est en dpression).   Les antidpresseurs "lissent" les motions.... Tu seras un peu moins perdue mais il faut que tu consultes un psychiatre... C'est important de parler..   Bon courage ma belle !!!

RQOFF0mXaa	There is really no trick to all this. It all boils down to excersise and eating in moderation. You absolutely have to do both or it will not work. Eat chicken breasts, fish, steamed vegetables. Make lots of juices in a juice maker of somekind and excersise at least four days a week for 1 hour and the weight will fall off, I promise.

However when we are asleep we are able to rest, and our body is more able to fight the bacteria, or anything that is actually making us sick. So you rest, and your body spends more time making you healthy.     Another reason is that lack of sleep sometimes causes headaches, and other things like dizziness.|`|XqOPDb83aa	When you are asleep your body is able to direct its main focus on getting you well.

If your partner has cold sores, they can spread to your genitals. It's not exactly the same virus, but it's definitely herpes!     Other than that, it's unlikely that you could get herpes while still being a virgin.     The signs of herpes are having raw painful sores and unusual discharge. If you think you have herpes, see a doctor for a vaginal exam. He or she will swab the sores and test for herpes.     Sores on your genitals can also be caused by syphilis. Syphilis is curable with penicillin, but if you're not having sex it's highly unlikely that you'd catch syphilis.|`|bZdrWYhYaa	Yes, "Cold Sores" are an herpes virus, and if someone with an active cold sore on their mouth gives you oral sex, or kisses you, then the virus can be transferred to you at that point. Genital herpes  is the same virus as herpes simplex 1, but of course it occurs on the genital area.  The symptoms are a painful burning itch, followed soon by the eruption of the painful blisters, that then burst, crust over and then heal.  The only way to avoid catching it is, ALWAYS use condoms, when having sex.  NEVER kiss, or have sexual contact with the mouth of a person with cold sores, they are contagious.  Infected persons, PLEASE, don't kiss babies or children, friend or relatives, on the mouth, as this is how most people contract herpes simplex 1, we are kissed as children by ignorant selfish adults who are infected.|`|z4UGlAa9aa	Burning when you pee, small, clearish bumps that seem to be filled with clear liquid... etc etc etc.
318cc58aa371766e29991feb829affc9aa	Lifting weights too young is a myth perpetuated by well meaning parents and adults who aren't very well informed on the subject, thinking that it may stunt growth or cause other growth problems.  There is no scientific or medical evidence to support this myth, and in fact lots of evidence backing strength training as being benificial for all age groups.  Team sports like soccer and football have a much higher incidence of injury.  The only time weight lifting is dangerous is when it's done incorrectly or form is sacrificed for too much weight.    Maybe you could print out some articles from this website and have your mom read them:    http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bbinfo.p...    It may allay some of her fears about it.    If you are able to start weight training, find a trainer or knowledgeable adult to get you started and show you how to perform the lifts correctly, safely and effectively.  Spend time perfecting form before adding much weight.  Another teen showing you how to lift isn't the right thing to do and will only lead to trouble, no matter how much he claims to be "tha man" in the gym.|`|f10ebdaf0188ca166507aae70c628222aa	if you are thinking about girls you are old enough, start doing arm curls with cans of soup, and lifting gallon jugs of water if nothing else.|`|TzftF2Pmaa	Yeah, you're too young.

A lot of guys use up all their testostrone to build muscle when they're young and later on have little left for anything else including the deepening of their voice.  This happens to a lot of guys who do gymnastics btw.  If you still want to build muscle, however, I recommend you run to build leg muscle and do crunches for the abs and push ups for the arms.|`|AA11319234	how old are you anyway?    if you're like 13. suit yourself, lift weights and work on your chest, abs, arms, shoulder, butt, and thighs. concentrate on your chest, abs, and your arms but also consider your butt and thighs. the other stuff, you can deal with later. You'll end up 16 and looking fine as hell for the ladies. ladies love guys that have a great body. wear tight light colored shirts by then and pants that look extremely well on you, and you'll get so much girlfriends. most importantly, you'll get sexed like hell. You'll have so much fun sexing the ladies. You'll get the finest ones. just use condoms because a lot of women with AIDS love to do hot guys just to get back at hot guys in general for giving them AIDS...haha lol but seriously, use spermicide condoms. not only can you get AIDS without it, but you can also get a girl pregnant...EARLY GOOD LUCK P****-HUNTING! haha lol oh yeah...watch out for herpes. you don't want to be a hot young guy that has herpes. that's just sick and wrong.    if you're like 10-13, think about yourself first. whether or not you can handle it. try some weights and see next morning if your body handled it well. If you can't handle it, great. it's great to start early! you'll be hott looking before you're 13! [if you worked hard enough], just in time for your newly acquired raging hormones to sex some hott young virgin girls! don't get anyone pregnant or don't catch AIDS now! if not, you're going to be weak and hurting when you go to school.    if you're like 5-9... i don't even know what you're doing in Yahoo answers because i couldn't even sign up for yahoo until i was like 13! lol but don't do it at all ok? don't lift weights and stuff.    If you're gay... You need to start as soon as you can, even if you are like 7 because the gay community hates fat people. they love buff guys and sometimes skinny but clean looking guys. Why do you think most gays have personal trainers. They would reject you and send you back to the straight community if you look fat. If you look hott and gay, you'll get so much sex every night from the most random gay guys in the gay club. but pace yourself, there are a lot of AIDS and HIV lurking in the gay community...haha don't go barebacking now! lol|`|PGjHvpNHaa	If you are still young I would suggest that you do as your mom says. Coz what happens is during the growth stage your muscles want to grow and if you lift weights your are stiffning your muscles insted. What you could do for now is do cardio. exercise and some basic stretching.    And remember Mom knows best|`|15YkiBFaaa	Start with push-ups and pull-ups. Those can help your arms get really strong and gain muscle and definition. Then, just do some low impact weight stuff like bench pression or using those rubber elastic bands that stretch out (most yoga kits have them). Those bands will substitute for the weights and it will definitely make you gain more muscle. Sit-ups and other stuff are also good.

The doctor needs to test your uric acid level too. He has thrown 3 kidney stones due to the uric acid level being high. He has taken allipurinol but recently particapted in a study and they gave him Colchicine. He is feeling alot better now. Also you have to watch your diet and avoid purine foods. Watch your milk and cheese intake for that is calcium. Hot dogs have even flared him in the past. While awaiting his meds, he did drink concentrated lemon  juice and it did help.

La infeccin puede ser ocasionada por una de las ms de cien cepas (tipos) diferentes de VPH que existen.            DESCRIPCIN       Verrugas en el escroto    La infeccin por el VPH es la ms frecuente de todas las enfermedades de transmisin sexual, pudiendo cursar con un cuadro subclnico y por lo tanto sin sntomas, haciendo que el paciente no tenga conocimiento a menos que aparezcan alteraciones en al prueba de Papanicolaou o en la colposcopia.    Al tratarse de una infeccin incurable, es positivo que la infeccin desaparezca de forma espontnea en los primeros seis meses evitando que cronifique, fenmeno que ocurre en casi todos los procesos.       CONSIDERACIONES    El VPH se encuentra tan difundido que slo las personas que no han tenido relaciones sexuales no han estado expuestas a l. En casi todos los casos la infeccin es subclnica y de corta duracin. Los condones no previenen por completo de la transmisin del VPH porque se puede contagiar durante los juegos sexuales y otras actividades distintas al coito. Sin embargo, el riesgo se reduce con los condones. Los productos que se utilizan durante la    menstruacin tambin pueden transportar al virus. La insercin de los tampones puede trasladar al virus desde los labios hacia la vagina. Las toallas femeninas pueden retener y transmitir al virus, y la humedad y la abrasin facilitan cualquier va de transmisin.    El coito anal es una forma de transmisin frecuente porque la mucosa anal es frgil y muy susceptible a la infeccin por VPH.       CAUSAS     La causa es nica:      Infeccin por VPH        Aunque existen diferentes factores de riesgo para contraer la infeccin:   Origen Hispano   Raza Negra   Alto consumo de alcohol (posible factor de una conducta peligrosa)    Alta frecuencia de relaciones sexuales   Nmero elevado de compa?eros sexuales   Sexo anal      Asimismo, el nmero de infecciones por VPH y su duracin son un factor de riesgo para el posterior desarrollo de cncer.     SIGNOS Y SNTOMAS    Un gran nmero de casos ocurren de forma subclnica, es decir, no presentan sintomatologa. Sin embargo, el sntoma ms caracterstico es la aparicin de condilomas acumiados leves o serios. Condiloma significa protuberancia crnica y son conocidos como verrugas genitales. Estas verrugas vara en apariencia entre las del varn y las de la mujer:    Mujer: Blandas. De color gris o rosa, pedunculadas y suelen encontrarse en racimos. Las zonas ms afectadas son la       vulva, la pared vaginal y el perin   Varn: Blandas. La presentes en el pene suelen ser lisas y papulares. Mientras que las del perine asemejan a una coliflor. A menudo, aparecen primero en el prepucio (tejido que cubre el pene) y el glande, y luego en el escroto (tejido que envuelve a los testculos) y la regin perianal (en sta ltima regin, son muy comunes en los homosexuales)           LLAMANDO AL MDICO      Inmediatamente aprecia la existencia de algunos de sntomas anteriormente mencionados o sea una persona con factores de riesgo consulte a su mdico inmediatamente y con cierta frecuencia. l indicar que pruebas y anlisis que requiere (colposcopa, prueba de Papanicolaou, citologa exfoliativa del pene, biopsica, etc.) con las que podr emitir un diagnstico correcto y recomendar el tratamiento ms adecuado.     TRATAMIENTO    En los casos clnicos de infeccin por VPH el tratamiento se realiza con:    Ciruga. sta solo est indicada en ciertos casos de verrugas en el ano y la cavidad oral         CUIDADOS     El mejor cuidado es reducir al mnimo los factores de riesgo.

La enfermedad originada por este virus afecta fundamentalmente a mujeres jvenes, con mayor frecuencia entre los 20 y 25 a?os.  El HPV puede producir dos tipos de lesiones: planas o verrugosas; que pueden afectar cuello uterino, vagina, vulva y regin perianal, con alto porcentaje de lesiones mltiples. Pero este tipo de lesiones visibles slo representa un peque?o porcentaje del total de las infecciones, y son las que tienen mayor probabilidad de contagio.  La transmisin del HPV puede ser por va sexual, a travs de instrumental no esterilizado,  intercambio de prendas ntimas, y de la mam al beb durante el parto.

G3Tbf8KZaa	It's really impossible to give an exact amount. All body types are differen't. Look at a healthy range on a medical chart. If she has a very tiny frame (small shoulders, small bone structure), then look at the lower side of the range. If she has a very large frame (broad shoulders, thicker bone structure), she can actually be sometimes even a few pounds above normal range and not be fat at all. If she is athletic, consider that muscle mass weighs more than fat, so there's no way her weight is going to be on the minimum numbers of the range. Curvy girls can go either way. Typically if she's an hour glass shape, somewhere in between the range is a good weight. Also with the hourglass figure, the higher numbers in the range might be a bit on the heavy side for her (since most hourglass figures carry a lot of excess weight in their butt/thighs/saddlebags). Look at her structure and try to determine where she falls, look at a medical chart and take a guess. As long as her weight is pretty much healthy, she is getting enough exercise, and she's feeling good about herself....the number really doesn't matter that much.

Some are more muscular than other's....some have more bone density..some have faster metabolism it all depends.  What's more important is  a healthy lifestyle...sleeping, eating and exercising properly.  I find the BMI index way out of line as I have a very muscular build and I weight much more than the BMI says I should weigh...yet I am healthy.  My heart-beat is 54 beats per minute, blood pressure 120/79..and that is a more accurate way to base ur weight.  If their is a certain part of her body that she is unhappy with..example abs then u can do 500-1000 stomach crunches per day which only takes 10 minutes or less.

8HZdfATEaa	Here are some simple suggestions:    1) Have a healthy and balanced permanent diet: dark green vegetables, fresh fruits, whole wheat and whole grain products, non-fat dairy products, fish, poultry breast, lean red meat, egg white.     You should cut out all sugar, soda, non-whole grain products and saturated fats: These aliments should only be a reward for achieving a goal, not a habit!     2) Start exercising     Aerobic and weight training will raise your metabolic rate. In result, your body will burn more calories.     * aerobic exercising     3 times per week, conduct an exercise that keeps your heart rate elevated for at least 30-45 minutes (ex: walking, running, cycling, swimming, aerobics, ... check out following link for more details about good exercise choices to lose weight: http://www.weight-loss-choice.com/Exerci...    * weight training     Alternate days of aerobics with weight training. You will build muscles that will burn more calories, even when at rest!     Additionally read some healthy diet literature for motivation.    And just remember that diet and exercise are like other important things in life: it takes time and sweat, but the result is well worth the effort!     Good luck!|`|Abr2wUgFaa	Actually, i went through the same thing as you. not necesarrily cheerleading but i ended up losing 40 pounds in just 2 monthes.  seriously, just change the way you eat, get self control and start working out,    if you start eat a lot healthier,  [ no fast food, no chips, no candy, no cookies, no ice cream etc.] and more fruits and veggies, you're body will react on its own and gradually shed weight, but adding strength training and cardio to your work outs will give you more rapid results.  it worked for me = )  good luck!!|`|yYHHj6T5aa	As a senior in high school, you might want to instead concern yourself with beginning healthy habits that you'll stick with for life. Your weight is healthy & therefore the numbers on the scale are irrelevant. Keys to success are proper nutrition & exercise. The weight, your body shape, & general wellbeing will resolve itself if you focus on getting a balanced, healthy diet & mixing regular cardio exercise with weightlifting.    If you're worried about your peers giving you a hard time for gaining weight, don't give them a reason to. Be confident in your body & yourself, treat it well, & don't forget that you'll be done with high school in a year. Focus on personal development. And remember: now you have more curves. Don't underestimate the power of curves.|`|AA10006216	not without being pretty unhealthy... The most you're supposed to take off and still be healthy is ~2 lbs a week so in seven weeks you should aim to lose about 14 lbs.  Actually they find that people who take the weight off any quicker than that generally gain it back... This is because your body has self defense mechanisms built in to prevent starvation.  Just start exercising eat healthy and don't be in such a rush to take it off.    + at your age you don't want to starve yourself as your body's still developing it can be quite harmful to you down the road...

Appendix cancer accounts for about 1 in 200 of all gastrointestinal malignancies.    Appendicitis (or epityphlitis) is a condition characterized by inflammation of the appendix. While mild cases may resolve without treatment, most require removal of the inflamed appendix, either by laparotomy or laparoscopy. Untreated, mortality is high, mainly due to peritonitis and shock. Appendicitis presents as pain in the right lower quadrant with rebound tenderness. In particular, it presents at McBurney's Point, 1/3 of the way along a line drawn from the Anterior Superior Iliac Spine to the Umbilicus. Rebound tenderness is when it does not hurt to press on the point but it hurts greatly when the pressure is released, or when the skin rebounds. Typically, point (skin) pain is not present until the parietal peritoneum is inflamed as well. Fever and immune system response are also characteristic of appendicitis.    The surgical removal of the vermiform appendix is called an appendicectomy (or appendectomy). This procedure is normally performed as an emergency procedure, when the patient is suffering from acute appendicitis. In the absence of surgical facilities, intravenous antibiotics are used to delay or avoid the onset of sepsis; it is now recognized that many cases will resolve when treated non-operatively. In some cases the appendicitis resolves completely; more often, an inflammatory mass forms around the appendix. This is a relative contraindication to surgery.    i dont know  but i thought this would be interesthing  thanks!

The cause of gum recession is bone loss.The only thing that can help is surgery.|`|ZbCFDqFDaa	Recession can be caused by    1. Periodontal disease, in which Coenzyme Q10 and other dietary considerations are helpful combined with good homecare and dental care.    2. Bruxism (clenching and grinding) in which wearing a nightguard to cushion the blow of these forces (250+ lbs per sqare inch)can help. It will ofset the trauma caused to the teeth, gums and surrounding bone.    3. Toothbrush abrasion. Brushing too vigorously, roughly and/or incorrectly. Best to always use a soft or extra soft toothbrust and brush gently, or better yet, use an electric toothbrush. Check out the ADHA website for brushing and flossing instructions.  An electric toothbrush takes the agressive brusher out of the equation, just follow the directions from the manufacturer.    Gum recession can be stopped but not reversed. Surgery can help, but that is a decision for you and your dentist to make together.

AA10223196	I got my life back on track with the help of medication.  I suffered all my life with major depression - since early childhood into middle age.  I searched for a medication to help me and it took 5 long years of experimenting with various prescription medications to find the ones that work for me.  I stopped driving for 8 years out of fear, stayed isolated and finally had to be hospitalized for mental anguish.  Then my doctor doubled my medication.    Now I take Wellbutrin 300 mg, Zoloft 200 mg and Ativan 2mg.  I haven't been depressed for over 5 years, I drive again and even go to parties and socialize.|`|AA10356839	Sometimes.

One type of depression is exogenous.  It's a reactive depression, related to one's perceptions about stressful events.  It gets better when the stressor goes away or when you change your mind about the stressor.    Another type of depression is indogenous.  It's a stubborn depression that seems to come on for no reason, and it's usually treated best with medication.  Even this depression lifts as mysteriously as it comes on.    The worst consequence of repeated depressions is a high suicide risk.  This is one very good reason for getting treatment.  On the lighter side, the vegetative signs of depression are unpleasant, and interfere with functions such as sleep, libido, appetite, energy level, self-esteem, ability to enjoy life, hygeine, and concentration.|`|6112fce921c5789ff47b05c280e49bffaa	It varies.  Sometimes it worsens without treatment.  Sometimes it lingers but doesn't worsen in severity.  Sometimes it will spontaneously remit after a period of time.  There are different types of depression and probably several different causes so it's hard to predict the course.  Reactive or situational depressions may get worse if the stressors remain.  Seasonal depressions usually disappear with the change of the season.  Bipolar and other biological or endogenous depressions usually worsen without medication but often can remit on their own.|`|91fc00a22d8f0a9df29e8537f5b843ddaa	Sometimes.

24c288025fc8fb924072b321e01f0a6baa	Basically what you're doing is the only thing that can reduce weight. You may need to cut your calories & fat intake (but eat a balanced diet high in protein including omega3 fatty acids, which help your nervous system function ) slightly to get the results your working for. If you've been working out regularly, you may need to up the intensity of your workouts as your body has adjusted to your current regimen.    You can't really spot fat loss, and the face especially just gets thinner as you loose weight overall. I would recommend weight training if you're not doing that already. It's important not only to burn calories & eat healthfully when you're trying to cut the fat. Lean muscle mass burns more calories than fat does, so building up your muscles (not making them bigger, but stronger & with more endurance) will help you shrink those fatty cells as you continue to burn more calories than you take in each day.    If you're loosing weight everywhere else, and still seem like you have a swollen face & arms you may want to bring this up with your doctor, as you may have lymph drainage issues.  *****  Proper hydration is also essential!|`|rYs4HRENaa	not sure what to do about that facial fat    for the arm fat, go to Kripalu and do Yoga and eat the veggie food.

T61ywn3Qaa	You simply stop eating things with trans fat in them.  Your body will naturally burn off the trans fats you've already consumed.    Trans fat is a type of fat almost entirely created artificially when hydrogen is pumped into normal fats/oils.  This has the effect of raising the melting point and reducing the oxidation rate of the product (which is why the process was invented to increase shelf life) - but it creates trans fats which are BAD for you.|`|sxzOPY2Laa	If you were one of my fellow high school aquaintances, I would tell you to purge; throw up & stop eating.

Just do curls by standing on the rope and holding on to both ends with your hands.  There are many different resistance exercises and if you don't want to get bulky stay with low resistance and many reps.  recomend 10-15 reps.
zC0XLym5aa	Do Crunches. Lie on the floor (with or without a mat). Cross your arms in front of your chest. (Donot place both hands behind your head. Placing both hands behind your head can cause lower back problems in the long run as it places unnecessary stress on that part of your body from pulling on your head and neck.) Another alternative to crossing your arms in front of your chest is to lightly place your finger tips behind your ears, without pulling on your neck or ears to help raise you off the floor. Draw in your abdomen towards your spine while inhaling through your nose. Now raise your shoulders (upper torso) towards your knees, using strictly your abdominal muscles. It is very important not to lift your entire back off the floor, as this can cause back strain, and the extended movement does not help you develop six pack abs any faster. The most important part of the crunch is the initial flexing of your abs as you lift your shoulders off of the floor. As soon as you begin lifting off the floor exhale through your mouth, ending with a gasp once your shoulders are off the floor. Then pause for a second once you are at the top of the crunch and exhale the last bit of air from your diaphragm while flexing your abs. The proper breathing and flexing make all the difference. Now lower back down slowly and controlled while inhaling through your nose, just until your shoulder blades touch the ground. Do not let your head touch the ground and repeat.     Do Sit Ups. Lie on the floor, feet on the floor, knees up and hands behind your head or crossed on your chest. Sit all the way up, lifting your lower back off the floor along with your shoulder blades. Lower yourself down. Repeat. Once this becomes relatively easy for you (i.e. you can do a quite a bit with ease) start adding more challenges. Find an incline bench or do these on an exercise ball. Once you "graduate" from that, do weighted sit ups. Hold a weight on your chest while you do these. As these become easier, hold heavier and heavier weights. You might also try lifting your feet off the ground while doing the sit ups or alternating the leg in the air, like pretending to pedal while sitting up. If your hands are behind your head, bring your left knee up to touch your right elbow and then your right knee to the left elbow.   Do Leg Lifts. Lie on the floor, legs straight out, hands at your sides. Lift your legs straight up (not bending your knees at all) until they're at a ninety degree angle (or close). Lower your legs and repeat without letting your legs touch the floor. For more challenge there is equipment at most gyms that will allow you to raise yourself up using your arms as support and dangle your legs. You can perform leg lifts there too. If you're using this piece of equipment, you can make it easier by just raising your knees to your chest. It's more difficult to raise your legs to a horizontal position with your legs straight. This helps firm up the lower abdomen. If you're truly a monster, try doing leg lifts with a medicine ball hanging from your feet. Or hang from a pull up bar and raise your legs in front of you all the way up to the bar. Still too easy?...   Do Jackknife Sit Ups. Lie down flat on the floor. Place your hands on the ground to your sides for balance; you can pick them up as you get used to the movement. Simultaneously raise your knees and torso so that your knees and face meet on an imaginary line extending from your pelvis to the ceiling. You should be able to kiss your knees at the top of the motion. Your legs will naturally fold bringing your feet towards your hips, much like a jackknife. Lie back down (i.e. "spread out") and repeat. Place a weight between your feet when you think you can handle it. What's that? More?   Do V-ups. Lie on the floor, legs straight out, hands on the floor but this time extended out over your head. Simultaneously raise legs and torso. Don't bend your knees! What kind of V would it be if you bend your knees? Reach with your hands toward the raised feet. Touch your feet if possible (might require some flexibility). Relax, return to starting position and repeat. Add weight between feet to match your taste.   Static Hold and Side Statics. Put your body into the push-up position but with your elbows on the floor, and you whole body flat. This position is known as the static hold position and it trains your core (including your abs) to hold the body in place which is the real purpose of your abs. Hold this position for as long as possible, but you should be aiming to start off with at least 45 seconds, while seasoned ab workers known to achieve over 20 minute static holds. To perform the side static hold roll onto one side of your body and lift into the same position as before, but this time only one arm will be on the ground with the other arm pointed straight up the air and your non-weight bearing leg resting on your bottom leg. Once again, hold this for as long as possible   Train Your Oblique Muscles. It's not as important to work on your oblique muscles at first, but eventually you'll want to start working these too. These are the muscles to either side of your stomach. There are multiple ways to do this and anything that includes twisting your torso against a resistance counts. There are twisting machines at gyms, you can twist while you do sit-ups, you can do side bends, you can twist side to side with a medicine ball in hand, etc. Be aware though, that many beginners tend to have weak obliques compared to their abs (it simply isn't used as much in daily life) so go easy on the sides at first.   Other stuff Since it is, literally, the center of your body there are many other tricks you can use to train your abs, and some of the other movements will more or less involve your abs. Including every abdominal exercise in existence would make this article painfully long and new methods are being developed constantly.

Yl9A49MVaa	You should discuss this with your doctor, and he can show you strengthening exercises or send you to a physical therapist and they can show/give you a home exercise program with sheets on how to do the exercises.  It is very important that a professional show you how to do these exercises so you don't make matters worse or aggravate your symptoms.    What Dugout41 said is true but make sure you know exactly how to do these exercises.  If you are unsure ask your physician or have a physical therapist show you.|`|8803ed632c73a886fe0bfde65d6df3dfaa	an easy one is get a ball and roll your foot on it while you sit down.  this increases the motion w/o having a lot of resistance/stress on the tendon.    do it in different directions such as clockwise, then counterclockwise, backwards and forwards.    as the strength increases you can then do toe-ups, leaning against a wall to balance, stand up and down on tippy toes:)|`|np44W0UHaa	I don't know what this is called.

Get a night guard to wear while sleeping. It can prevent further damage from grinding. Your dentist can get you fitted w/one or one at the drugstore. Get the one you boil and mold to your teeth. For the arched teeth, depending on how they are, your dentist might be able to smooth them down. Or veneers. Also ask your Ortho about braces. If your top/bottom teeth are not biting correctly, it can be the cause of grinding. But best to talk to your doc about it. Good luck!|`|7z0Y2GO6aa	well i dont have a answer to fix that but you can wear a night guard when you go to sleep so then you wont be grinding and it can prevent tooth loss.

a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	This is one of the stupidest questions I've read lately.    Being a "dwarf" is a medical condition. It is caused by one of several genetic diseases. Do you have one of those diseases? No? Then you are not a "dwarf". And you would know if you had one of these diseases. They are obvious, and debilitating.

The word dwarf has generally replaced midget even for proportionally short people, though the term little person is preferred. According to the Little People of America, dwarfism is "a medical or genetic condition that usually results in an adult height of 4'10" (147 cm)[1] or shorter, among both men and women, although in some cases a person with a dwarfing condition may be slightly taller than that."
DsEEATKSaa	1.  Minimize distractions. This means turning off the televsion, the ipod, your phone, and any other external devices which could serve as distractions. Study in a space SPECIFIC TO STUDYING (e.g., not your bed). Keep all your study "tools" in that spot (e.g., pencils, paper, good lighting). This area could be anything from a desk in your bedroom to a study carol in the library.     2.  Study in short spurts. This means to set a time frame (15 - 20 minutes max) for studying. After each "study burst", follow with 5 minutes or so of a calming (but non related) activity such as working a sududo puzzle or reading your email.    3. Be certain you are getting adequate sleep. I can not emphasize this enough. As a young teen, you should be getting no less than 9 hours of sleep each night.    4. Ask your teacher about peer tutoring. Sometimes, a little extra help can make all the difference.    5.  Set an Algebra Acheivement plan (to be implemented from Monday until the day of the test). Lay out specific times (use the "study burst" method) for studying. Include small "rewards" to be given on Wednesday (the day before the test) for sticking to the plan. Include your parents in the plan. Ask them to help you keep on track.    6.  Visualize yourself SUCCEEDING on your algebra final this Thursday. Be very specific in your visualization. Include how it will feel to conquer the test. SEE yourself receiving the good grade. Picture the looks on your parents' faces. Really imagine how good it will feel to conquer the subject.

You might get up a couple times to go to the bathroom, or to get a glass of water, and just walk around.  The best thing to do so you WILL fall asleep is to do something boring.

Rnheoky7aa	DO NOT USE A VACUUM. The vacuum will spread the mercury all over the place.  Get out of the room (but if you have a mask I think you'll be fine, but you DO NOT want any mercury to get on your skin)... If you want to properly dispose of the mercury, you'll have to call the Toxic Waste/Hazardous Material workers (HAZMAT) to come in  and clean it up.  But that will cost you some money--and it probably won't be cheap.      Once it's cleaned up, NEVER buy a CFL, (Compact Flourescent Bulb) ever again--they are so enviromentally unsafe it's ridiculous. They may save a watt or two, but are very dangerous:    CFL's contain up to 5 miligrams of mercury per lightbulb.  There's over 4 billion incandescent lightbulb sockets in America.  If you replace all those with the "energy saving" CFL's, we'd have about 20 billion milligrams, or 50,000 LBS. of mercury which aren't there now spread across the country in homes and buildings.  When these CFL bulbs are throw away in the trash, they will end up in the nearest landfill contaminating water supplies all across the nation, ongoingly I might add, as these bulbs are continually replaced.    That's real "envirnomental" isn't it?  It was Communist Cuba's Fidel Castro who started this CFL movement, so that ought to cause suspicion right there.  You won't hear liberal environmentalists like Al Gore talking about these facts of the CFL bulb.      These articles will help explain it more.

15YkiBFaaa	It's sad that people tease other people when they think that they're 'fat' or 'chubby'. I think it just degrades everyone's perceptive on what's normal and beautiful in this world. I don't think 135 pounds is fat. It's just plain annoying when people think it's weird for people like me who are trying to gain weight after being teased for being too skinny. Anyways..I'm getting off subject...If you really want to lose weight (I think you're good the way you are :) ), then you could eat healthier foods like broccoli (a good source for growing) and grapefruit. Eat a lot of veggies and fruits. Exercise more than what you eat. I have a couple of friends who are into this stuff but I'm a total food junkie. It's just that it's hard to gain weight cause I do a lot of sports. Be sure that you're losing weight the healthy way. Before I go, I would just like to say "Screw you" to all those people who teased you. It's not cool.|`|xMNjn8gRaa	Always Think Fit:    First step in exercise is to always Think FIT. To make physical improvements, you need to work your body harder than usual. This is referred to as the overload principle. As your body becomes more conditioned, you need to increase the frequency, intensity, or time of your workouts in order to continue improving your fitness level    Choosing an Exercise:  The best exercise is an activity that you enjoy enough to really pursue enthusiastically.   ? Indoor (Facility) Activities: If the treadmill, stairmaster, rowing machine or stationery cycle doesn't excite you, sample some group activities that strike your fancy. Participate in a group cycling class, beat stress with yoga, find balance with martial arts, stay cool with indoor swimming, or kick some you-know-what with boxaerobics.    1. Change your eating habits (i.e. start eating smaller portions of food) before if you ate a full plate of food try eating 2/3 of a plate instead.  2.    o Substitute aspartame for sugar  o Try eating 3 or 4 smaller meals during the day rather than 2 large ones  o Eat your main large meal at midday with the other meals much smaller in content  o Don't eat heavy meals late in the evening as the body wont have time to digest it so it ends up stored as fat in your body.  o Balance your meals out during the day so in one day you have a mix of protein, carbohydrate and vitamins  o Drink lots of water during the day and before, during and after exercise, you should drink at least 8 big glasses of water per 24 hours  o Drink alcohol in moderation  o Stop smoking if you smoke or cut down  o Eat more fibre i.e. pulses grains nuts, pasta, brown rice, cereals, fresh fruit  o Eat more vegetables as part of your diet  o Eat less dairy products or choose those with less fat content i.e. cottage cheese  o Try steaming or poaching food instead of frying it, frying adds calories by the bucketful  o Cut down on Red meat and eat more lean or better still chicken and fish instead  o Use low fat oils in cooking i.e. sunflower, corn or Mazola  o Cut down on your salt intake, there are hidden salts even in tinned foods  o Try substituting carrots or fresh fruit instead of biscuits and sweetmeat when you have a craving for something in between meals.  o Drink semi or skimmed milk as opposed to full cream  Simply choose a diet which is low in fat and cholesterol, moderate in sugar and salt and high in fibre but at the same time has a variety of everything thus making it a balanced diet.    Calculate your BMR!!!!  BMR means Basal Metabolic Rate.It is used to estimate how many calories you should consume.By using a simple formula called the Harris-Benedict principle, you can assess your BMR.  Your BMR is the amount of energy your body needs to function.Then, to lose weight, you'll need to cut calories or burn extra calories and shoot for a level lower than the results you get with this formula.   We use about 60 percent of the calories we consume each day for basic bodily functions such as breathing.Other factors that influence your BMR are height, weight, age and sex.  Step One : Calculate your BMR with the following formula:  ? Women: BMR = 655 + (4.35 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) - (4.7 x age in years)  ? Men: BMR = 66 + (6.23 x weight in pounds) + (12.7 x height in inches) - (6.8 x age in years)  Step two : In order to incorporate activity into your daily caloric needs, do the following calculation:  ? If you are sedentary : BMR x 1.2  ? If you are lightly active: BMR x 1.375   ? If you are moderately active (You exercise most days a week.): BMR x 1.55   ? If you are very active (You exercise daily.): BMR x 1.725   ? If you are extra active (You do hard labor or are in athletic training.): BMR x 1.9  Create a Calorie Deficit:  In order to lose weight, you must create a calorie deficit. It is easier and healthier to cut back your calorie intake a little bit at a time.  Every 3,500 calories is equivalent to 1 pound.   If you cut back 500 calories a day, you will lose 1 pound per week.  If you exercise to burn off 500 calories a day you will also lose 1 pound per week.  Ideally, you should do a combination of both, (e.g. cut back 250 calories; burn an extra 250 calories).

As long as you don't have any pain then there isn't any problems.|`|rCStxMByaa	That's fine--it's exactly what is supposed to happen.    Yes, chewing would probably accelerate their disintegration--as they dissolve, they lose structural integrity, and anything moving against them, like food in your mouth, would just tend to make them come apart more quickly.    You're probably still not fully healed, so try to be a bit careful with your gums for a while(like, don't brush too hard or chew really tough foods).  But you're healed to the point that you don't need stitches anymore and your body can heal itself on its own.|`|656b8575a7cd4033b4b692270baf69cdaa	Yes that's normal. That happened to me to and I was like, aren't they suppose to fall out of my mouth? But no they just disappear/dissolve. So yup, really normal, no worries.|`|DlzkN9yBaa	yes you are right!that could be the reason..i work with an oral surgeon so i know for a fact that it is ok that they just disolved and disappeared and the other ones will too, this is totally normal..you should be worried:)|`|GnZTf7ANaa	your dentist must have used an absorbable surgical suture, one that is made from material (like those from the intestines of mammals) which are completely "digested" by enzyme activity or by reaction of tissue fluids. there should be nothing to worry about.
AA11575803	the numbers on the scale mean crap and so does that bmi, it is all about the inches you loose and how you feel about yourself.      dont worry just keep doing what you are doing you will get where you  want to be|`|PuY2jmZgaa	What is your diet like?  Is it possible to increase your cardio workout to daily and weights every other day or every 3rd day?  Weight loss happens when Calories burned exceed Calories taken in.  However, don't skip meals - be sure to eat healthy but cut out the excess sugar and junkfoods.  You will reach a point where muscle mass increases as body fat decreases so you weight may not get any lower.
AJq0VTzlaa	Yep, it's called Auto-Fellatio. Apparently these men are flexible to bend their spinal cord and reach down and do it.  Videos of that type are readily available @ most adult stores.    And on the other hand, it's possible to do the intercourse thingy to one's self. Apparently the man's penis is long enough to reach to the anal area and pentrate.  They have to make sure they don't get an erection, yet enough blood flow to make the penis reach.|`|AA10232591	Richard Pryor did :)|`|P6iHpIksaa	Yes.....IF YOU GET YOUR LAST TWO RIBS REMOVED LIKE MARYLON MANSON.....GROSS!|`|oYtUZCG0aa	frickin sicko
eXNuXX9Paa	Depends how you got the condition (rock concerts, work conditions).  I have this condition and have gotten use to it. I have had many tests, hearing, MRI of my head, neurological exam, ear, nose and throat md exam. They could find nothing wrong with me that was related to tinnitus, so they had nothing to treat, it is annoying but I learned to live with it.  You need to start with your doctor.  Good luck!|`|rYs4HRENaa	my Dad has that    I think there is an operation for it    I think you go deaf in that ear from it though|`|5ab5c045a9b3598b9b1e7ac7da08bb0aaa	a) Sometimes I have had a kind of noise in the ears, the problem was that I was very worry about something. It was a kind of stress, and the medication I have taken does not help.    b) Some ringing in the ears is because you are hearing one of your chakras. That noise is not painful, but is strong. Maybe a meditation Master can help you.    c) If is something different from the cases above you can use a hot sweater in the ear (some clothes hot, you can use an iron for that), or ask a medical doctor.
zLkzkohxaa	yup!  lunges and squats will build up the muscle and make it much bigger and rounder.....do about 50-100 of these each day and u will already notice an improvement in a few months.....also if u go to ur local gym and if they have lunge or squat machine try those out....remember: do a few repetitions and heavy weights!|`|wvFKpQy1aa	Bicycling and elliptical!!! And squats, too! Especially bicycling should help you. I always wanted a curvier butt though I have no problem with mine, but that's just the way I think it's more fun, so bicycling pushed it up and made it bigger (in a good, healthy and fit way).|`|V2LP8zRVaa	You need to eat 1 piece of meat a day an d all of it will go to your butt.|`|GwzGZgxHaa	if you do exercises to work your gluts, your butt will get bigger.  exercises includes things like squats, lunges and leg presses.    good luck.|`|8hCnMazUaa	If anything, exercise would make it smaller because it would burn off some of the fat you have.  The best way to solve your problem is to be happy with the way you look and to make sure to eat healthy and exercise.  Maybe some weight training would make you gain more muscle mass in your thighs and gluteus maximus.|`|ef43e70de1f797f33240beb3c5a072d5aa	squats. high weight low reps and up your protein intake.

Go to your local GNC store and buy some stuff called L-Tyrosine.  It brings natural pigment to the skin and it helps with your nervous system at the same time.  I have been taking it for a week and a half and I have got a great tan to show for it without staying in the sun all day.  It works great.  My Biology instructor turned me on to it and I have to say it is working!!!!

c0409627d09f8c2f38561958fd52a476aa	You don't have periods when on birth control pills. You have withdrawal bleeds. It may sound like it's just semantics, but it's an important distinction. Your endometrium has to grow under the influence of estrogen and mature under the influence of progestin, and when they're stopped, bleeding occurs. The pills you're taking may simply leave you with too little endometrial growth or too little maturation to shed. With the trend to minimizing estrogen dosages, it's more and more common to have no or irregular bleeding.|`|3jUNp95Zaa	are you breast feeding?|`|4YJYxZrxaa	Obviously, talk to a doctor, but know that all pregnancy tests can give a false negative, in other words, you may not have enough hormones yes to show positive.  But if it says positive, you are pregnant, except in very rare cases.|`|FvVVsdfuaa	It depends on where you are in your cycle. Birth control works by introducing hormones(estrogen & progestin) into your body. Did you breast feed? If you did, then you were on the "mini-pill". I believe it is progestin only. After breast feeding, ob-gyns change to est/pro pills. The amount of hormones in the pill vary from brand to brand. The dose could be too high causing  your lack of a cycle. Call your ob-gyn and explain the situation.

That term, however, is thrown around these days more than anything else. Just because you feel you may have it or you feel you may have some symptoms, doesn't mean that you are truly ADD. If you have ADD, you're in constant motion. You never stop. You'll bounce from one thing to the next to the next, etc. Neither alcohol nor drugs such as marijuana will have the calming effects that they are known for. Ritalin, in a person with TRUE ADD, will act like alcohol/marijuana and will calm you down to the point that you're very sleepy, almost like a zombie, but functional. Ritalin taken by someone without TRUE ADD is the equivalent of taking crystal meth. / cocaine. This is something to seriously consider when thinking about whether or not you have ADD.|`|28e608d319d595771ccbb492cd1bf82faa	hello i was put on ritilen for my add and it turned me into a robot pretty much i hated it instaded i whent on heath food pills  they where like fish oil pills they where high in fatty acids witch feeds yer brain witch is saposed to help yer brain focus mroe|`|bf678b1f588f69f8c289790238f0bbb0aa	yes as an adults i also took focalin and it really worked but i stopped taking it because i felt i  was more depressed than add|`|2sxEiOZLaa	They will most likely try to reccomend something else.

981df12e3af5a0a9a808ef0ad9c7d9cbaa	Your BMI is 27.4  which makes you overweight.  You should probably weigh between 120-140 pounds, depending on your bone structure and muscle mass.  See a doctor if you have any more questions.|`|bVLWVonUaa	At 5'5 you should weigh 149 pounds or less. To classify as overweight you'd have to be 150-179 pounds, to classify as obese you'd have to weigh 180 pounds or more. So you would be considered overweight or "fat'' as you put it. You would need to lose a minimum of 21 pounds to classify as average. But it could also be different if you have any medical problems or if thats the way your body naturally is or if your very muscular. Or it could be because of other factors. The best thing to do would be to consult your doctor.|`|m0WZk4l5aa	it might be a little chubby im not sure?? ask a doctor|`|0UZqIMw3aa	a little chubby, i'm 5'6" and 117 (kinda on the skinny side)...around 145 is normal|`|wEuZZAqGaa	a more accurate answer to this question is to check ur body mass index, if u run a search engine on it u should find one for online easily. jsut type in ur weight and height.  runners need to be a little under or jsut on weight which is a body mass index of 18-20 percent.  although, depending if you male or female, this percentage can differ.  this sounds a little chubby though, for im only 5 feet short than u (im 5ft) and i only weigh 90-95lbs.|`|XfTEYfwzaa	That would quite depend on the muscle mass of the person.    For example a college softball player at that height would easily weigh that much if not more like 185+.    Someone who has a very sedentary lifestyle with that weight may be considered chubby at the heaviest, though it depends on how they wear their weight as some may not look as heavy as others.    I would say it is not a very unhealthy weight. Though obviously not a size 0, it seems like an average weight for sure, as the average pant size for an American woman is a 10-12, definitely sounds like you would fall into that category or under.    Most nurtitionists and health experts say that the current push on the term "obese" is ridiculous, and does not take all factors in to account. My mother qualifies as obese at the age of 57, 5'4", and 150 pounds.  (The kid who did her BMI calcs apparently included what she so lovingly calls her "saggy old lady skin" IN the calipers when measuring her and therefore got an incorrect reading) Mind you she is an ocean lifeguard and at her last physical her coach rated her UNDERWEIGHT because she should be keeping up more muscle mass.     Yeah... it all depends, doesn't it?    Check this site for a chart that has some decent information.

jC7RwO44aa	Whey is thought to contain the perfect combination of muscle-building amino-acids (the building blocks of protein) and enhance the immune system. It has also shown a rapid utilization capacity, for maximum protein absorption by the muscles (making it perfect as a post-workout drink). Recent studies have suggested soy to be as effective, if not more so, than whey in terms of its ability to promote gains in lean muscle mass. Although whey is by far more popular because of it's anabolic (muscle building effects) soy is actually better for MAINTAINING physique, which is what looks better for you.|`|0h45HRULaa	Take whety if you want get buff. Always look at saturated fat though!!!|`|hwovSZvkaa	Neither.  You want a casein protein blend.  It's a slower digesting protein so it won't get wasted and give you excessive gas like whey protein tends to.  Soy is a weak protein supplement compared to whey and casein.  Most casein blends have whey in them as well, so kill two birds with one stone.

a0F0P6GKaa	Are you younger than 16 or are a virgin? It might hurt...and if you have a tiny body.      Do you know about where the blood comes out of? Thats where you put the tampon in.     You have to hold the tampon a certain way.  It's hard to explain, so I linked a couple good websites.  Also, when you buy a pack of tampons, they come with instructions in the box.    Be careful.  Don't leave it in too long, and DON'T forget that its in there.  Women have died from it being in too long, or pushing another one in when they forgot they had one in already.  It's good to use if you're wearing something skimpy, or a bathing suit.    I still prefer pads. =)|`|DsEEATKSaa	No, it does not hurt.    Instructions are in a brief pamphlet in the box.    No worries.|`|5bf9b8d43814dc2a572dcd9ef1a006cbaa	not if you use playtex gentle glide   the other ones did hurt  this one goes in easy and dont hurt|`|Jo5XFD8uaa	I'm 13, and I had the same problem.  There is nothing to be scared of =]  It doesnt hurt at all, in fact you cannot even feel it!!!  And also sit in a comfortable position, and stick it in.  Make sure that you stick it in far enough, so you cant feel it|`|9PjYqc11aa	No, they don't hurt. I used tampons when I was still a virgin and not even a teen ager and it did NOT hurt. Don't worry about it. They might feel weird since you're new to them, but never painful if you insert them properly.The box always comes with instructions (it's illustrated) and some FAQ if you're wondering about anything.  Just relax (it's important you relax or your vaginal muscles could get tighter and make it uncomfy), get in a comfy position, and go slow, and if you're not sure how to put it in there, use a mirror to look as you do it until you get the hang of it, then try it on the toilet.

How it hurts: You feel a sharp, stabbing pain on one side of your pelvis during deep penetration. You may also feel a dull ache during your period.    The possible cause: An ovarian cyst -- a fluid-filled growth that affects about 30 percent of premenopausal women.    What to do: Most cysts are harmless and disappear by themselves within two or three menstrual cycles, says Canavan. Your doctor will probably do an ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis and ask you to check back two months later if sex still hurts. In the meantime, take 400 mg of ibuprofen one hour before intercourse to relieve discomfort and try having sex with you on top, a position that allows you to control the depth of penetration.    2. How it hurts: Your genitals feel itchy, irritated and sensitive, especially to the touch. After intercourse, your vagina looks red and inflamed, and feels as if it's on fire.    The possible cause: A yeast infection, which triggers pain during sex in about a quarter of sufferers. Don't wait until you see the telltale cottage-cheese-like discharge before seeking help. "It's a myth that this discharge always accompanies a yeast infection," says Elizabeth G. Stewart, M.D., an ob/gyn and coauthor of The V Book. "Sometimes pain is your only clue." Other possible culprits: feminine hygiene sprays, scented pads, perfumed soap or bath oils -- all of which can irritate your vagina.    What to do: See your ob/gyn, who will confirm whether you have a yeast infection, and if you do, will prescribe medication. As for skin irritation: No woman should use feminine hygiene sprays, because they often trigger rashes. If you have sensitive skin, buy unscented sanitary pads, use only mild, hypoallergenic soaps and launder your underwear with fragrance-free detergent. An over-the-counter cortisone cream or Vagisil can relieve tenderness and itching.    3. How it hurts: Your perineum -- the area where you may have had a deep tear or an episiotomy when giving birth -- feels taut, tender and painful during initial penetration.    The possible cause: Rigid, hard scar tissue due to that tear or episiotomy. Women who have either during childbirth are 80 percent more likely to report painful sex three months later than those who didn't experience tissue damage during delivery, reports a study from Harvard Medical School.    What to do: Massage the painful area once a day for a few minutes using a water-based lubricant. "This helps desensitize the nerve endings and makes the skin more pliable, easing penetration," says John F. Steege, M.D., an ob/gyn professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. If the area is very sensitive, ask your doctor for a prescription cream with lidocaine, a numbing agent that will make intercourse less painful. Still no relief? Consider minor surgery to remove scar tissue.|`|BACYDUZtaa	it is because you both do it in hurry and with a sense of guilt. have ample of time, good place and a long long foreplay untill you feel great lubrication.
2c73ae968208b0d3a730b84eb2a82dabaa	they are not supposed to poke you so you may want to go back and have the orthodontist look at it. as for the wax i had a hard time keeping it on. just try to get your teeth as dry as you can and put the wax on firmly so it will fit to your braces and not fall off. braces are also very painful if you havent already noticed so i suggest eating really soft food cut up in mini bite sized pieces to limit the amount of pain. also advil or tyonol(sp) are pretty good pain releivers for when your teeth start to get sore. also i would invest in some popcicles, icecream, the cold really helps your gums. as for the rules they gave you about not to do. limit your dark soda intake sprite and siera mist and stuff like that is ok and wont stain your teeth for when they come off, chewing gum is ok if you dont get the cheap really sticky kind like big red ans spearmint. dont eat frozen candy bars and stay away from carmal it is your worst enemy with braces, hope i help and if you need anything else just contact me|`|AA11968773	You may want to call your orthodontist and ask them if there is anything they can do...they may want to have you come in and clip the wires or change the brackets- it's possible that maybe one could be bent (right after I got my braces on I had one that just tore up my lip and my orthodontist finally figured out that it was bent so that was why it was tearing up my mouth so baldy). The only other thing that I have found that helped besides wax and just finally getting your mouth used to the braces was to use some of the canker sore numbing gel to help with the pain. Good luck!|`|KTxlwf6maa	well the best thing to do is go and report to your dentist|`|URl3LLygaa	I had the same problem when I had braces...

This is cause by hormonal changes "raging in our bodies".  Facial hair, armpit hair, hair on the legs and arms, pubic hair also begins to develop.  This is normal.  What this means is, you are changing from a boy to a man.      Some young men also develop a small, movable lump under the nipples.  This is also normal.  It will eventually go away.  You may also have some increased sensitivity; possibly some soreness.  This is also normal  The soreness will eventually subside.  Your nipples will probably  increase in size.  This is normal.  They may also increase in sensitivity.   Isn't this a plus?      Typically, young men develop a fascination for nipples both large and small.  Can you imagine what your chest would look like without them?      Young men also tend to tease other young men for having something that appears different than what they have, i.e., a larger penis or larger nipples.  To prove my point,  when someone makes an unkind remark to you in front of others, ask them to lift their shirt or drop their pants.  Their nipples and/or penis will probably have the appearance of a six year old.  If they refuse, you've made your point (or they have).    Some people will usually tease and taunt you if they know  what your are sensitivities are.  If you counter their insult by smiling, let them know it doesn't bother you and acting like a real man, they will leave you alone.    This is your golden opportunity to brag on yourself.  Prove that you are proud of what you have.  You won't need to discount the other guy.  He will do it to himself.  People who taunt others are usually cowards and become very obnoxious to take attention away from their own insecurities and inadequacies.      They secretly wish they had something else, either bigger or better.  Don't kid yourself.      So ... bottom line ... enjoy and appreciate what you have.  I personally think my puffy nipples are attractive and sexy.  I for one, don't want my chest to look like a six year old.      People usually stare for one of two reasons.  They are envious and they like what they see or like my Mother used to say, "...if they have never seen it before they won't know what it is or if they have, it won't be anything new."      My best advice to you is to appreciate and enjoy everything you have today.  Tomorrow, it may be gone.

UpbQGcuYaa	Autism is NOT genetics.  It is not like down syndrome or Nurofibromatosis.  There is no genetic link.    --------------------------------------...    "SPEAK UP LOUD FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT"  Today 80% of the Autism population is under 18.    In 2005, The Center For Disease Control announces that autism is the fastest growing serious developmental disability in the United States. In 2005 estimated that 1.77 million Americans are affected by autism. In real terms the estimated autistic population of 1 million plus cases in 2004 could reach 5 to 25 million by 2015. In 1994 the autism rate was rare and was estimated to be 1 in 10,000. in 2004 the autism epidemic revised rate was estimated to be 1 in 200. In 2005 the autism epidemic revised rate is now estimated to be 1 in 166 by the Center For Disease Control. In 2015 the statistics indicate the estimated rate could be as high as 1 in 7, if this 1994 to 2004 exponential growth rate continues at its present rate.    Therefore no matter who you are or where you live, Democrat or Republican, if these statistics of the past carry forward through the next decade; your family may be devastated by autism in the next decade... The current autism epidemic could become the most devastating epidemic in history, with 10-15% of the population afflicted in the next decade that need long term care. Many experts associate high levels of mercury in the environment as the cause of Autism.    The latest study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 1 in 12 American women of childbearing age has mercury levels in her blood above the levels considered safe for the developing fetus. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency experts have estimated that 630,000 infants are born every year with unsafe levels of mercury.    These higher mercury levels in the mothers body can be passed on during pregnancy. These 1 in 12 mothers could be unknowingly predisposing their unborn child to become autistic due to high levels of mercury passed on from the mother during pregnancy. It is now recommended that pregnant women not eat tuna fish, which is known to be high in mercury. Even small trace amounts of Mercury are known to be harmful to developing fetuses and never break down in the body. Mercury vapors can remain airborne for a year. These vapors can therefore travel around the world and we could be accumulating mercury in our bodies by inhaling them that over time.    According to a recent study of mercury emissions throughout the world. Coal fueled power plants in the U.S. emit 48 tons of toxic mercury vapors into the air per year. China emits 1000 tons of toxic mercury vapors per year. The toxicity buildup of breathing these vapors along with mercury fillings over a period of decades within our bodies, may be the cause of the high levels mercury in women of childbearing age. Vaccines with mercury further spike an already high level of mercury passed on from the mother during pregnancy at a critical time in the infants development Vaccines with mercury may be the trigger that causes autism in children and an already high level of mercury passed on from the mother.    Acute mercury poisoning and Autism share many similar symptoms. Women who are pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant should now consider have their blood tested for elevated levels of mercury. We must ask the government to make Autism Awareness and prevention a national priority. Those who are saying that the numbers were under represented in the past are burying their heads in the sand.    "Houston, we have a problem", we are going to have the next generation devastated by this disease if left unchecked at its present growth rate. This epidemic must quickly become the major health initiative of our time just as the search for the cure for aids has. Otherwise the effects on the next generation, families, businesses and the economy will be catastrophic. We can no longer wait for this "simmering modern day plague of the 21st century" to arrive at our doorstep in the form of a lost generation of innocent, helpless, unsuspecting children that through no fault of their own will need a lifetime of care.    Autism Awareness is Key|`|6Ettaq3qaa	you do have an higher than normal chance, becuase it was in your parents genes, so it could show up in yours, even though you didnt have the gene. whoever you have a child with also might have the gene, so that makes it a higher chance.|`|0b6d8d91d252a69810ca18e7ae817864aa	I work with someone who is autistic. As of now, seeing as though they aren't sure what causes autism, I would say who knows. If you are going to have a child soon, then I would be safe and go with yes, but seeing as though there is no like for sure test for autism, you won't know. If you are going to have a child later on in life, then maybe by then they will have figure it out. The person taht I work with who is autisic has a perfectly normal sibling if that matters.

jR5kvXgeaa	you have to eat to lose fat.  since we cant spot reduce body fat naturally the only way to get rid of your belly is reducing body fat percentage with diet and exercise.  sit ups and crunches wont help - all they do is build muscle, they do not burn any fat.  find daily calorie intake calculator on the net, enter all your stats and it will tell you how many calories you need a day to maintain, take off 300-400cal off that number and thats how much you need to lose.  eat 5-6 small meals a day (eat every 2-3 hours - it optimizes your metabolism)  5-8 servings of fruit and veggies a day  8 glasses of water  have complex carbs for breakfast - they give you energy  have protein (lean meat, legumes etc) for dinner - repairs muscle  cardio is the only fat burning exercise and burns fat all over your body (running, jogging, swimming, spinning, elliptical etc) 4-6 times a week for 30-50min (ideally 45min because the first 20-30min body burns carbs and only then starts burning fat), light weight training (more muscle=faster metabolism)  dont consume foods that are made of white flour (white bread, cakes, pasta etc.), sugar loaded foods (cookies, icecream, candy etc) and nothing fried, oily.  ofcourse you can spoil yourself once in a while with a little treat:)|`|0f49406b90defffce3a0f65909e39bdaaa	Eat only when hungry and not more than thrice a day.

AA11108609	I would definitely ask for the ultrasound before getting the IUD.  I was always told by the doctors that if you take 10 pregnancy tests and one comes up positive and 9 come up negative, you are pregnant.

I got negative results and a very ligth period untill I was four months pregnant with my firs tson!  i know it sound slike that is impossible but I swear to it!!!  Oh and also you may be getting your body all crazy due to stress, Before you get the IUD in place your doctor should giv eyou a pregnancy test just to make sure but call the office and tell them you had a positive urine test and then a negative blood but you are still without your cycle an dhaving symptoms and wanted to know what you should do becasue you ahve a IUD placement due soon or if they would be willing to give the test again on the day of your appointment.  You might ba all worried about nothign and that is why your body is still not well bleeding yet becasue you are all stressed out!

AA10766729	The most likely reason for this would be a lack of lubrication.  If you even slightly drier than normal, then it could cause friction burns and/or tearing to your vaginal wall, and cause soreness and swelling.  Try a good lubricant like ID or AstroGlide.  If it doesn't help, it might be a good idea to change your pill...estrogen levels can play a HUGE role in vaginal dryness however, so I'm betting this might help.|`|5bf9b8d43814dc2a572dcd9ef1a006cbaa	i would say you probaly need to use more lubrication  i used to have the same problem but i satrted using more lubrication and it got better  it also helps to have more foreplay that way you will be wetter  before he enters

0a0vJ2ZMaa	Don't say anything, but tell her that you think shes really pretty, and that you wished you weighed as much as her, and (if you're skinnier) that you wished you looked more healthy, like her.  DOn't really mention her weight so much tho, as that can worsen the problem.  But if she gets noticeably skinnier, tell her casually you think she looked better if she gained weight *unusually nice compliment/comment thing* don't be too obvious, but just slip it in, and tell her a guy was checking her out (even if its not true, just make her feel gorgeous right now) and if she ever talks about a guy she likes, tell her she could easily get him, (who knows, maybe the extra confidence will make him attracted to her!) or something like that.      Also, get ONE(don't tell all her friends, that would be supa lame of you) friend who you know will not tell her you know, to do the same.  Constantly reassuring her, and helping her with her self consiousness is probably the only solution.  Since its a mental issue, you can't really just "talk her out of it"|`|4xFKJsLeaa	Watch how she eats and see if she goes to the bathroom to vomit her meal.

Hslv3OQmaa	yep, you are overweight.. And yeah, that's probably from you havin dt previous baby. It's hard for moms to lose weight.

AA11262612	yes, smell is a big part of the taste sensation.|`|AA10108962	Taste & smell work as a team to allow the sensasion of flavors. With one sensasion diminished, flavor experience can be sufficiently altered, though the four basic tastes- salty, sweet, sour & bitter often remains intact. You see, nerves in the nose sense airborne molecules released from odor-causing agents of food. Then the molecules are drawn up the nose through breathing & the odor is sent to the brain. When food is put in the mouth, taste receptors send nerve impulses to taste centre of brain. Brain then uses both impulses to distinguish the flavor of a particular food. Certain medical conditions, drugs or lack of certain nutrients can cause decreased smell & taste. If u have  cold or sinus infection there is a tempory loss of smell with subsequent alteration in taste. You have to take antibiotics for sinus infection, so visit an ENT specialist. At home u can take warm lemon water, lemon tea, a little spicy or herb enriched food. Avoid extreme hot or cold food & strong/bitter flavor like coffee.
AA11262612	yes  SSRIs    Some of the newest antidepressants are called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. SSRIs alter the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain, which, like other neurotransmitters, helps brain cells communicate with one another.    Fluoxetine (Prozac?), sertraline (Zoloft?), escitalopram (Lexapro?), paroxetine (Paxil?), and citalopram (Celexa?) are some of the SSRIs commonly prescribed for panic disorder, OCD, PTSD, and social phobia. SSRIs are also used to treat panic disorder when it occurs in combination with OCD, social phobia, or depression. Venlafaxine (Effexor?), a drug closely related to the SSRIs, is used to treat GAD. These medications are started at low doses and gradually increased until they have a beneficial effect.    SSRIs have fewer side effects than older antidepressants, but they sometimes produce slight nausea or jitters when people first start to take them. These symptoms fade with time. Some people also experience sexual dysfunction with SSRIs, which may be helped by adjusting the dosage or switching to another SSRI.|`|5c40baa93c7ba8164e45f151f1878025aa	I believe they are. What are you taking? Paxil is the first thing that comes to mind here.|`|VmIRQJP1aa	most are, yes. Especially Zoloft - I was on Zoloft for social anxiety and depression and it helped tremedously, especially after having tried several other medications, I can say that this one helped the most for me.
iH0gFAAraa	Was the surgery on a bone or a tendon?  I partially tore a tendon on my middle finger and when it finally broke completely, it wouldn't bend either...    The I got surgery done and the improvement was minimal.  But the tendon was fine now, it's just that the surgery made the tendon stick to the meat part of the hand, so it couldn't slide up and down to aloow the finger to move.  i had to get a second surgey and it's better now.    Conclusion: Go see a doctor for a diagnosis, you may require another surgey, but it may be something very simple.|`|AA11109150	sounds like the bone fused and not doing therapy on it correctly caused this...

OG6jViGLaa	To a very high degree, you should weigh as much as you feel happy with weighing.    As far as a "healthy weight", that's what most of the other posts are about (calculating your BMI, diet plans, etc).... but most people will say what the "average" is according to different opinions.    As long as you are at a weight where you are healthy, the most important part is that you are HAPPY with your weight... not that you "should be X pounds", but that no matter what you weigh, you are happy with that instead of striving to be a size 2 or something like that    That being said, if you want to lose weight, exercise is a really good (and safe) way to lose weight. In addition to that, I would recommend meeting with a nutritionist or dietitian to see if there is something else that may benefit you more|`|WbbF7svZaa	I lost 6 pounds my first week.    Well all you really need to do is pump up your water intake to 70-80 ounces a day, spreading it evenly throughout the days.     When you first wake up, drink 8 ounces of hot water with the juice of half a lemon. This is great for cleansing your system.    Eat breakfast everyday. Oatmeal (no sugar, just a little skim milk) with a banana is good. Or two egg whites and one egg scrambled or however you like it. You can add turkey or ham sliced to it.    Lunch- salad (spinach and lettace with cucumbers or anything you like) with grilled chicken, light balsamic vinegrette or apple cider vinagar as your dressing, and some feta cheese if you like. Also you can crunch up a Wasa cracker if you want some crunch.    4 pm- have either a piece of fruit, Or Dannon light and fit yogurt with some almonds in it.    Dinner- Have some meat/fish, tomatos, green beans or brocolli, salad if you like. and some fruit.      Dont eat past 7:30       Exercise- Either do 30 minutes at 3.5 with a 5 incline on the tredmil, or if you have no tredmil, then you can just jog up and down the steps for 20-30 minutes. (everyday)|`|YVeKnIj5aa	To successfully lose weight, you must carry out  a plan to balance your caloric intake with exercise.

I needed a physical too, and my doctor barely looked at me before signing the papers. She just listened to my lungs and heart, took blood pressure, and shone a light in my eyes that made me really dizzy.

qsOkYrToaa	Healthy weight lost is one pound a week, which might not seem like much, but after a couple weeks you notice a big difference.  This summer I lost ten pounds doing simple things that took almost no effort or sacrifice.  Add an extra 15 to your workout everyday, NEVER EAT TILL YOURE FULL (since it takes about half an hour for your stomach to tell your brain that youre full), eat within the first two hours you wake up, dont eat two hours before you go to bed, drink NOTHING BUT WATER (if you do that, you'll lose weight faster), and dont eat fast food (if you must, make sure you're cutting your food intake in half whenever you eat fast food).  This is the only way I ever lost weight because every other weight loss program is hard to stick to, cost money, or require cutting carbs and sugar to practically nothing.

The after pain will be the same as a sore throat and you will be stuck to Ice Cream and Sherbet for a few days, but hell whats wrong with that?! I myself have had the surgery done and i can tell you from first hand experience that you are making it more than it will be. If you want to worry about any type of pain worry about the IV that they put in because it will be worst than the actual operation. Good Luck!

Plus working your abs - working your core, obliques, upper and lower abs... You can't sculpt your abs by just doing crunces.. You have to have a variety of exercises.. Those little  muscles have memory.. they know if they do the same thing day in and day out.. they won't work as hard..    Work with an ab wheel, yoga ball, etc - variety variety variety!|`|9nawcUffaa	Eating regularly and watching TV on my exercise bike :)     Drinking alcohol only once a week.

All I did was lift weights and a little cardio afterwords.|`|RmtARe1eaa	ummmm...i have always been pretty skinny. one of the reasons is because my mom never let me or anyone of my siblings "snack". we never had like chips and cookies in the cabinet. we also eat healthy meals...(for the most part)  i also run a lot, and take my dog on walks. in the summer, me and my cousin ride our bikes a lot.  just work out often and eat healthy!    hope this answers your question.

nLSZIL13aa	it's not bad, i used to get nosebleeds a lot because the veins in my nose were too close to the surface, in jr. high i got them cauterized.  They don't put you to sleep or anything, it's over in about 10 min.  It hurts a little bit, but not too terrible.  Mostly it feels a little bit like burning, and a lot like you have to sneeze really bad.  What they do is basically put the cauterizing chemical on a long cotton swab and swab the inside of your nose where you need to be cauterized.  I recommend it if you've had problems that can be fixed by this, it's super fast and what pain there is  is gone in about 15 min.  Good luck and don't be scared!|`|Z6JnJN4Daa	What is corterising?|`|11n031iraa	My Grandma kept ketting nosebleeds, so they told her to come in and get her nose cauterized. She was really worrying about it. She knew they put this stuff in your nose and it burned your nose.    When she went in to have it done she was all tense and freaked out. The doctor came over and had this needle in his hand, which my grandma assumed was the anaesthetic. he goes "This might tickle." She said it felt like someone had poked a hair into her nose and it tickled.     Then she waited in the chair, and the doctor said "there you are, you can go now"    She was amazed!!!  She had thought that it would really hurt, but it didn't hurt at all. She was in and out in 5 minutes!!!    She told the doctor she thought it was going to be worse and he said that there was this new technology which was much simpler to use and less painful.    Hope this helps!!!!|`|YhiMey0daa	Are you talking about cauterization or cortisone shots?  Can you be more specific?    Why do I get a thumbs down, for his poor spelling and lack of information.|`|a4jmDyBUaa	no they numb you up and you don't feel a thing. Had it done several times and it was fine.|`|LU4lLDYwaa	No you dont get put to sleep, heres what happens, the doctor will put a cue tip up your nose with a local anesthetic, and then she will put up almost like a metal prong, it basically burns cells to prevent nose bleeds...It sounds painful but i promise you its not bad at all, its a quick pinch of pain almost like getting a shot and then its done.  And no more nose bleeds!!! :) Dont worry about it, its quick, easy and just about pain free.|`|uI42ITJFaa	they numb the area so no it does not hurt unless you are not properley anethsatised or there was a problem but thats VERY rare sorry for that info      good luck           have a good day  the emo kid  XXxxXX|`|Efzn69W7aa	I'm guessing you're asking whether or not getting your nose cauterized hurts..    You will be put to sleep. You won't feel a thing. There will be discomfort afterwards.    I'm guessing this is to stop nose bleeds.    Don't worry about it.|`|obOoLHKeaa	Cauterized.    And no, and no. (usually)    They may numb it.  But it does not hurt.|`|1v7rZYumaa	no it doesn't hurt, and you usually stay awake for the procedure. it help alot if you get spontaneous nose bleeds. they burn the vessels in your nose so they will not bleed anymore. It actually feels like an itch when they are doing the procedure, it makes you feel like you want to rub your nose or squint it. it is not painfull, it just may be shocking when you see the instruments they use, your going to be suprised to and probably alittle scared, the instrument are large and make alot of noise... but, not it is a very wuick procedure and very painless, they put a tampon up your nose which you keep in there for a day maybe more... thats all.

Yo se q hay ocasiones en las que la calentura te gana, pero si ya vas a estar activa yo seria de la idea de acudir con el mdico y empezar a protegerte, ya hay tantos anticonceptivos que el medico te podra ayudar..  en cuanto a tu pregunta creo que para asegurarte haste la prueba pero si puedes la de sangre que es ms efectiva, ms vale que salgas de la duda xq hay mujeres que aunq esten embarazadas siguen reglando.  Mucha suerte y piensa en acudir al mdico para que no vuelvas a pasar por estos miedos, no hay nada como la proteccin pero la calentura es ca?ona y nos hace cometer muchas burradas..    salu2|`|otEmFjE9aa	Si ya te vino tu regla despus de todas esas veces; pues ya no hay nada de que preocuparse.

Saludos|`|PIvy1saJaa	Si tomaste la pastilla de emergencia correctamente  y antes de que transcurrieran las 48 horas para un efecto ptimo NO estas embarazada porq ya te est bajando. Lo q puedes tener mas adelante son los efectos secundarios de las hormonas sintticas que es esta pastilla. -Es probable que en un mismo mes tengas dos sangrados tipo menstrual y q se alteren drsticamente tus perodos en tiempo, duracion y cantidad ( te puede bajar ms o menos de lo acostumbrado; ms dias o menos das, y los espacios entre uno y otro perodo pueden ser ms cortos o ms largos de lo que estas acostumbrada). Es por esto q tengas mucho cuidado porq el sangrado q tienes ahora no es necesariamente tu menstruacion sino una acomodacion porq tu cuerpo va a tardar entre 4 y 6 meses en terminar de eliminar el exceso de hormonas y mientras puedes seguir con uno o varios de los efectos que te mencion. Y por la tardanza en la eliminacin de hormonas y por tu seguridad, NO deberas de tomar otra post day hasta varios meses despues( si la necesitara, claro ) , ya que los efectos de las hormonas acumuladas en tu cuerpo pueden ser peligrosos. Ademas q no es muy segura su proteccion por lo menos este mes...  Seria mas aconsejable q te cuides uses algun metodo pastillas o inyectables para cuidarte ya q estas teniendo una vida sexual activa y no es un juego estar embarazada y traer al mundo a un ni?o no deseado...debes tener otras metas primero.

These are all just right weight and height for a girl to me. some people might disagree but trust me you dont want to be an unhealthy and too fat but you also dont want to be unhealthy and too skinny. so eat what you want and get exercize so your still healthy. just dont over eat. if you weigh 150 at your age ide say thats probably over weight to most people so if you want to please them stay under 150 above 100. good luck hope you have a nice day!!!!|`|3X7KTE39aa	ur not fat i think that is about normal for your age but you really shouldnt worry how you look especially if its for a guy or guys if thats the guys is focused on then their jst shallow

You may have a mild sprain, or injured tendon or ligament. Just limit your walking, no running, jumping, elevate it when you are sleeping, you can try ice packs on every ten minutes and off every ten minutes, and over the counter pain reliever like ibuprofen.

Estos queman grasa porque si no se saca la grasa no se van a notar porque va a haber esta capa que lo cubre todo.
