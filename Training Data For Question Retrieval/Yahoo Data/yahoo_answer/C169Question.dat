20090223163007AAmAuLF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What do you think of children being charged as adults?	I would like to know what everyone's opionion on this is... as this woman and I use to be friends years ago..      WAMPUM, Pa. (AP) — An 11-year-old boy shot his father's pregnant girlfriend in the back of the head while she was lying in bed in their western Pennsylvania farmhouse, then got on the school bus and went to school, authorities said Saturday.      Jordan Brown was charged Saturday as an adult in the shooting death of 26-year-old Kenzie Marie Houk, who was 8 months pregnant, Lawrence County District Attorney John Bongivengo said at a news conference.      Houk's family and friends, who gathered at her parents' house Saturday night, told The Associated Press that Houk had had problems with the boy in the past.      "There was an issue with jealousy. He told my son stuff," said Houk's brother-in-law, Jason Kraner, 34. "He actually told my son that he wanted to do that to her."      Brown, the son of Houk's live-in boyfriend, was charged with criminal homicide and criminal homicide of an unborn child, Bongivengo said. He was being held in Lawrence County Jail. A preliminary hearing is set for Thursday.      The fifth-grader was picked up from school Friday by Pennsylvania State Police, who found Houk's body after her 4-year-old daughter told tree cutters on the property that she thought her mother was dead, Bongivengo said.      The boy had told police there was a suspicious black truck on the property that morning, causing investigators to look into a false lead for about five hours, he said.      Inconsistencies in Brown's description of the vehicle led police to re-interview the victim's 7-year-old daughter, who implicated the boy in the killing, Bongivengo said.      "She didn't actually eyewitness the shooting. She saw him with what she believed to be a shotgun and heard a loud bang," Bongivengo said, adding that the weapon, a youth model 20-gauge shotgun, was found in what police believed was the boy's bedroom.      The shotgun, which apparently belonged to Brown, is designed for children and such weapons do not have to be registered, Bongivengo said.      Brown's attorney, Dennis Elisco, said the evidence points to the gunshot wound being "consistent" with the boy's hunting gun, but he wanted to see stronger proof that it was Brown's.      "I believe Jordan did not do this and I'm looking forward to seeing the physical evidence to see if it matches with what I think happened," he said Saturday after meeting with the boy in jail.      The attorney also said he met with the boy's father, Christopher Brown, and planned to file a motion Monday to have the boy released on bail and move the case to juvenile court.      The attorney said Christopher Brown was "in a state of actual shock and disbelief." There was no indication the boy had a problem with Houk, he added.      "This is a tragic, extremely tragic situation, and it's way too early to have any substantive comment," Elisco said.      Police said they had no motive for the shooting, and Bongivengo would not say whether the boy confessed.      "An 11-year-old kid — what would give him the motive to shoot someone?" Houk's father, Jack, told the AP. "Maybe he was just jealous of my daughter and the baby and thought he would be overpowered."      Jack Houk said the family had gathered at his home in nearby New Castle on Thursday night to celebrate his 4-year-old granddaughter's birthday. Everyone was excited about the pending birth of his daughter's baby, he said.      "That's the last time I seen her, my daughter," Jack Houk said.      He said Brown was raised by his father and grandmother. Houk and the boy's father had been together since May 2008 and were engaged at Christmas, her father said.      Jack Houk said the boy and his father used to practice shooting behind their farmhouse, and the two enjoyed hunting together.      He didn't know of any recent problems between the boy and his daughter, but said there had been "some tension" in the beginning. Houk said his daughter had been working hard to forge a relationship with the boy.      Kraner, Houk's brother-in-law, said Jordan could be a "rough kid." He said his son was interviewed by police about the boy.      Kenzie Houk had been renting the farmhouse in Wampum, a rural community about 35 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, for no more than a year, neighbor Cameron Tucker said.      Tucker's wife sometimes drove Houk's younger daughter to the bus stop because she went to preschool with the Tuckers' 5-year-old.      "She was very protective of her kids," he said.

Ive had to go to the bathroom alot 1 & 2 and im wondering if I could be pregnant?? Ive been trying for two years and im tired of waiting!

20090223165146AA40Ttp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	My period is 3 weeks late, BFN at 2 weeks, Miscarriage last month..is this normal?	My fiancee and I were TTC until I miscarried at 6 weeks along in January. I started bleeding on Jan 4th, miscarried on Jan 7th, and didn't stop bleeding until Jan 11th. The initial bleeding started the day that my period would have been due. If my period had started on time this month it should have been Feb. 1st, It is now Feb 23rd and no sign of AF. No cramping, no mood swings, no chocolate cravings(darn!). We have used protection all except one time since the miscarriage. I took a HPT on Feb 13th, and it was negative. Is it normal for my period to delay after the miscarriage, or is it possible that I'm somehow pregnant again?  If I am, I'm worried about miscarrying again, as I tested negative when I was 2 weeks late for my period. I'm planning on going to the Dr. if my period doesn't show up soon. Does anyone have any advice/answers that could be helpful?

20090223165535AA2AAlG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What is this world coming too when..?	A couple SUE an IVF firm, because they conceived two babies, rather than one?      A lesbian couple from Melbourne, in Victoria, had undergone the IVF procedure, where they had offically 'signed up' for 'Up to two embryo's' implanted.      It was then just minutes before the implantation, the mother receiving the treatment said "I only want one now"   Now, the doctor implanting her thought this was a general, joking conversation, as the mother did not elaborate, and was officially set up to be implanted with TWO embryo's, so he planted them both.      Of course, this resulted in twins, and apparantlt "Damaged" the lesbians' relationship, and were awarded around 317 000 compensation, for the "grief, devastation, terror and anxiousness, (and a little bit of heartburn!) of having two babies.      Now, I understand a guideline was breeched, although the implanation contract said otherwise, and I do get the reasoning to which they would want compensation, for the breech.      My point is that they are arguing on such petty facts!   "Grief of having twins" and Heartburn!   They were actually paid a small portion of that money, for heartburn compensation!      Does anyone else think this world is going crazy, if people are suing over the fact of having two miracles, instead of one?!

20090223170048AAlXRNq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Does this make us bad parents?	Im 17, married and pregnant. ( I was planning my wedding with my now husband before the baby so no, i didn't not get married just because i was pregnant, i wan actually engaged 6 months before we found out i was having the baby. My husband is 19, and finishing his last year in high school, he is also working, he works very hard for the money he earns. Im continuing my school online and graduating early adn going to a college near by, where i can take my child.  we do in fact live with my parents, but were renting a room, we have rent payments,that include all the houshold bills, and food. We try and save up as much money as we can also. Something that has made me upset is the people judging people who are on public aid. Yes our decisions lead to a baby, and were fine with that. We knew if we had sex, and got pregnant, we loved each other, and our child and we were going to take care of them and not give them up for adoption.    So my husband does work, goes in sick or otherwise, and we save as much money as we can! but we just needed help with my insurance for having the baby. We are going to get off the public aid as soon as we have the child, but we couldn't fid a insurance that would put me on because i was pregnant. Everyone says this makes us bad parents. whats your personal opinion? Honest answers only please.        I only think public aid makes you a bad parent if you do not work at all, and dont inteand on trying to find a job. You reliy on the goverment and thats it,       I also think it makes you a bad parent if your working, still struggling and to proud to ask for help from the goverment when your child is suffering or going hungry. I just want to know what everyone else thinks.    Thanks Michelle.      and good luck to all those trying to have babbies :)    I can honestly see why this experiece is so amazing, i know its way earlier then i have planned, but my husband and i love our little girl s0o very much, and i wish everyone( of age) to know that joy

On Feb 5th I ran out of pills and didn't start taking them again till the following monday which was Feb 9th. Starting on Feb 14th till today I've been feeling nauseaus, tired, head aches, mood swings and cramping. Today (Feb 23rd) I started bleeding slightly. I get my period every 28 days from the last day of my period. So if I started my period then its 2 weeks early....Am I pregnant or is this just in my head??!! I know I should take a test but at the moment I'm low on funds and I just want other people's opinions! I already have a baby and I feel the same way I did when I was pregnant with him. My heart tells my I am but my head tells me I'm not. Answers please!!!

20090116122134AAO3wtZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	When do babies like to entertain themselves?	Hello my son is two months old and I'm trying to get him to be a little more independent We currently attend mommy baby classes but my son can't stand to be put down and cries to be held constantly. He has a tummy time mat and he won't have anything to do with it, he has a bouncer and hates it, he has a swing but only stays in for 5 minutes before he's screaming to be held. I always make sure he is fed, dry, and awake before I try to put him down so I know his needs are met. My question? Is this normal? When do they outgrow this phase? Literally can't do anything unless he's asleep and the sling kills my back believe me I've tried he is a heavy boy.

20070921142622AAGnqIB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How do you keep MIL from taking over?	My bf and I both work and so when the baby comes he wants his parents to babysit while we are at work. We live in an apt attached to their house so it should make things easy, but I have seen how his mother is with his sisters son and I'm worried she is going to try and take over. She is always telling his sister what milestones he should be at, what she should feed him, and the list goes on. I am worried she will be the same way with our son, especially if she spends 40 hours a week with him. Should I suggest a part time babysitter now so at least she doesn't get too overbearing, that way if she starts getting controlling I can just go full time at a sitter? Is there a nice way to tell her this is our baby and though we appriciate the help she can't tell us how to raise him?

I was put on bed rest, until I get an ultrasound on Sunday morning. They said we're going to try to see a heartbeat and if we can't see one I may have to consider the fact that the baby died.

20090222141238AAAvI0h	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Son will ONLY sleep in car seat (15 months old)?	My son was born at 31 weeks and had really bad reflux/GERD. It was so bad that Children's Hospital put him in rice cereal at 8 weeks!! He's fine, made it without choking, lol. Anyway, he had to sleep sitting up and so we started this thing where we would put him in car seat and put the car seat with him in it in his crib. We did this so he would get used to sleeping "in his crib". Well, it worked out fine while he was still a baby baby. Now he's 15 months old and cramped in his car seat and refuses to sleep laying down in his crib. I can't keep letting him sleep in his seat, I mean he's 25 and some change pounds, 34 inches long, and he's sleeping in a infant car seat.          Any ideas on getting him to sleep in his bed? I'm about out of hair and ideas, lol.

20090222152223AAmVxqX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is there any way I could be pregnant?	ok, I know I must be WAY over reacting but I'm still really worried.  I'm 16 years old and I have only ever had sex once.  We used a condom and it did not break. That was in December.  My period came a few days late in January but that never really means anything to me because my period has always been messed up.  I can go 3 months without getting my period.. it's weird.        When I did get my period it was only for a day-day and a half and then I had about a week of it being really light.  Once again, my period had done that before I had ever had sex.        I haven't had any big pregnancy signs or anything either.  I just heard that you can have a bit of your period when you are pregnant and flipped out a bit.  So can anyone help me confirm that I am not pregnant?

20090222142726AAtYX8c	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	To all parents...Am I a good daughter?	This is sort of something I just recently began thinking about.   My relationship with my parents is very up and down. Some days, we'll be fantastic, other days, we'll be ripping each other's heads off. If you care to read any of my other questions, you'll see what I mean.      I know I can do better, but what? I don't want such a stressful relationship. I don't want to fear them, and I don't want them to look down at me.      In general:   -If they ask me to do something, I do it.   -I try to come up with creative gifts for them on holidays and birthdays.   -Every so often, I'll ask if they want me to help them with anything.   -I used to get caught up in their fights, but since a few years ago, that's stopped.   -I don't really yell back if they are yelling at me anymore.   -I try to talk to them as reasonably as I can.   -I often take care of my siblings.   -I get As and Bs in school.   -I am trustworthy (don't sneak out, alcohol, drugs, wrong crowds, etc.)   -I am a bit detatched from them, and don't really socialize with them much.   -I try to show my gratitude whenever they get me something.   -I do like to show my opinion when I have one, but I try to be as open-minded and respectful toward's others beliefs and thoughts as possible.   -I have different beliefs than my parents. Some, I am not sure if they'd approve of, but as long as I'm not hurting anyone, I am firm with my beliefs and I will refuse to change them due to an outside force sayings so.      I know I am imperfect, and that I always will be.   But, I can be better.   First of all -   How would you judge me as a daughter now?   Second of all-   What can I do to be a better person toward them?

20090222134442AAlUAkw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	My now-ex-bf cheated on me...am i being too harsh?	I am less than two weeks from my due date and he has been out cheating on me. I left him and will not go back.       I don't want him in the delivery room and I have no intention of even telling him when I go into labor. I also don't want to tell him the baby was born until after I'm out of the hospital because I don't want to see him. I want to name the baby without his input.      I will let him be a father to this child if he wants the responsibility, but am I being too harsh about not even telling him the baby was born until after I'm out of the hospital?      Things to consider:   1. If i were to call him, or have someone else call him, while i'm still in the hospital, he would show up and cause trouble.   2. Not sharing the birth experience with the father will have no effect on the well being of baby.   3. I would never use the child to get back at his father for what he has done to me.

20090222152012AAPaHiO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Any other new moms just become single and then find out you're expecting another one?	I'm a 21 year old with a 9 1/2 month old daughter, her dad and I are not getting along at all, he's completely going down the wrong path and there's no way I'm dragging my daughter and I along with him. He's moving out March 1st. We just found out that I'm 5 weeks pregnant, due on October 23rd. In my heart I want this baby more than anything in the world. But then my mind is telling me that I should have an abortion because there's no way I'd be able to make it on my own as a single mom of 2 new babies. It's tearing me completely apart because having an abortion just goes against everything I believe in. I feel so resentful towards my ex because we've been together for 4 years now, and we planned on having this beautiful family and getting married and happily ever after.. but then in a matter of a month and a half it all went down the drain, he had a complete change of heart.      I just would like to hear some stories of anyone that's been in a similar situation, or knows of anyone that had to make a decision like mine... whether it ended with abortion, or ended with another beautiful baby. I don't know of anyone that's been in my situation where they're a single mom of a 17 months old and a newborn at 21. Thanks in advance for your stories and advice.

20090222141212AALnQBq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Should I keep trying to concieve after clomid?	I was taking clomid on days 5-9 of my menstrual cycle. I had an ultrasound done two days after taking my last pill of clomid. When the doctor came in he told me that I had at least 4-5 mature eggs on each ovary all ranging 14mm-20mm and only one egg was about 20mm the rest were all smaller. He told me that I should wait for my next cycle to try to concieve to avoid multiples, but he also said that I could only fertelize one egg. I have been trying to concieve for two years on my own and now that I have the medication to do it and im so close I cant afford another let down. I have PCOS and only have 2-3 periods a year so its not easy to try as often as I want. My husband and I had intercourse that night and yesterday and we arent sure if we should wait or just go for it! We want a baby so bad esp. me and I cant wait! I have been patient for so long, but I can hold back any longer! Any suggestions or help or maybe hope??
20090222145549AA98qsN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Hmmm....MOMS...what would/do you do?	I'm reposting this question b/c i got so few answers before:      I just answered a question about three girls playing with matches, and the mom of two of the girls spanked them pants-down, which I think is okay considering how dangerous matches can be. But it got me to think a little…the girls were different ages but got the same spanking. If you were the mom, would you spank exactly the same? Or would you give them both the same number of slaps but make them harder slaps for the older one? Or would you give the older one more spanks? If you’re a mom, then what do you do when you have to spank more than one child for being naughty and making sure the spankings are fair?.

This is my "job". My husband works full time, and than has side jobs doing construction whenever he can get the work.    Somedays, (most days, actually) I feel so stressed out.....like I need to get away for an hour just to catch my breath. Is it unfair of me, when he gets home from work, to say, "hey..I just need to get away from here for a while......" and it's not even to go out and have fun, it's to go to the drug store, or the grocery store. Is it also unfair of me to expect him to help out when he gets home? For example, to feed the baby, or to change a diaper, or to put the kids in their pj's?   Or does his day end at 5:00 when he gets home from work and I just have to accept it?     I realize he is paying the bills, putting up with crap from people at work all day...boy if I could only get paid for doing my job..........   Just wondering what your opinions are. Thanks.

20090222135340AACO6WS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	I'm having a problem with my 5 year old son to "want" to come to my house on my weekends.?	I have a 5 year old son who has been staying with me since he was about 8 months old.  His mother and I divorced when he was very young and I have always wanted to make sure that I have been involved in his life.  Like I stated before, he has been spending weekends with me since he was around 8 months old and he will be turning 5 in April.        Recently (the 3 months or so) he has been giving me and his mother a very hard time about coming over.  I live with my gfriend and have been with her for almost 2 years.  For some reason, he has been pitching an absolute "FIT" about coming over.  Saying that I am mean to him and all sorts of crazy things.        When he does come over, I really try and spend quality time with him.  Whether its taking him to the zoo, movies, playing baseball (which I am coaching his LL team), out to dinner, I pay ALOT of child support and am on time with it every month (just wanted u to know that I'm one of those good fathers)..whatever I can do to really try and establish a good, solid bond with him.  His step-father is truely a good guy and takes very good care of him.  Its almost as though he doesn't want me to be his "dad" because he feels satisfied with the "family" he has with him mom and step-dad.     I have had very open and honest conversations about this with his mother and she doesn't understand it either.  She says that "coming to dads" house is the only place he gives her trouble about coming over.  He is fine when he goes to school, his grandmothers, and friends....Its just my house.       This past weekend was the worst so far.  He threw another fit at his basketball game...wouldn't even play, and went crazy in the parking lot about coming and spending the weekend with me.  Not only does it bother me, but it is starting to really hurt.  When ur a parent, I understand that you are going to deal with heartache, but this is really getting crazy.  I have been around my son his entire life (5 yrs) and for some reason, he doesn't want anything to do with me.       Since we (his mother and I) don't seem to have any answers, we have talked about seeing a counselor.  Hopefully this will help as well.       PLEASE, I would appreciate any thoughts.

I would like a response to my question, I noticed that infant formula contains TAURINE which really shocked me as I first heard of this through the recent surge in energy drinks I did a bit of searching and found that :      Taurine, or 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, is an organic acid. It is also a major constituent of bile and can be found in the lower intestine and in small amounts in the tissues of many animals and in humans as well.      Now this was news to me, the descriptor filled me with disgust, animal BILE, SO why is it in baby formula?????? Also more importantly from which mammal did it come from, i hope not from the recent cull?      SO anyone else notice anything else lurking in there please post.

20090222114721AAke2Ss	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	How can I feel better as a woman?	I couldn't breast feed with any of my kids. With my first, I had absolutely no milk come in at all. I tried everything. I pumped every half hour and I got nothing!! Then with my second he would not latch on at all. I kept at it and kept offering him the breast every time he would eat for about 3 months and he just wouldn't take it. I had enough milk. so I pumped and gave him that. Then with my last who is almost 3 months they found lumps in my breast (breast cancer runs very high in my family) so I had to have biopsies done and they were just too tender to even breast feed. I feel like my body has failed me. I feel like I am less of a woman and my husband tries to make me feel better but it just doesn't work. I feel like I am less of a woman. My question is, has this happened to anyone else and how can I feel better about myself as a woman?

I actually feel so mad at them that I feel like killing them, That's how serious it is. They completely use my mom and take her for granted, she never goes over to their house so why should they be over our house eating all of our food. I'm sick of it. All of my moms friends are over our house nearly everyday of the week having dinner and never once has she ever went over theirs for dinner. I'm sick of it! I have no time what so ever to even talk to my own mother about what college I want to go to because they're always here. I don't know what to do. If we had 4 cakes in me, my sister, my dad, my mom, my brother and nobody never even gets any because all of my moms friends eat it before we can. my moms friend and her daughter and over 3 different times a day, they're over our house more than they are at their own house, her 11 year old daughter lyes down on our sofa with her feet up, goes through our cuboards without even asking, uses our home phone to call her friends cell phone without asking and if they come over and my dad orders fast food they don't even offer to pay half when they eat most of it... the daughter is constantly on my dads PC messing about, sitting on our kitchen worktops which even I wouldn't do (she wouldn't do it in her own house so why do it in our house!!!), she comes in my room when I'm sleeping, and not to mention they are such loud people, they talk soooooooooo fricken loud that it wakes me up! and I mean with the recession at the moment nobody has the money to be wasting food. when I wake up they're here, when I eat dinner they're here, when I go to bed they're here. I hate to complain but it seems like they're using my mom and for some reason she can't see it!!! I hardly get any free time with my mom and I don't want to go out when they're here because why should I??? its making my mom and dad argue because they're here so much we have no family time together. My dad even said thats theres no point of us going grocery shopping because its mainly my moms friends/kids who eat it so they should be paying for it, not him.      And I know what I'm about to say makes me sound like a totally dramatic idiot but I'm so unhappy because of them, I cry everyday in my room when they're here. I lock myself in my room. I just can't stand them. They've COMPLETELY torn my family apart. All my mom and dad do is fight.       Have you ever been in this situation, What did you do?

20090222155356AAblWRp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	My friend got her phone taken away?	I texted my friend last night and didn't get a reply till this afternoon.    It said "phone taken away". Obviously her parents still have it.      My friend is 17. When I first got my phone at 15(19 now) my mom took it away a few times when I was 15-16 but 17+ I never got it taken away. I think a few times my mom tried but I would never hand it over and it cost money to have it temporarily disconnected, she'd just give up. (I literally cannot go without my phone.)       This isn't about me though, this is about my friend and what gets me the most is that her phone is on and her parents texted me.    Her parents have full access to her phone. They can see everything and are using it.       When my mom took my phone, I would either only give her the phone and no battery or I would lock it and shut it off and it would need a password to get to anything once it was turned back on. Same if I got it taken away at school.   I would have been in shock and flipped out if my mom had gone through my phone like that and did what my friends parents are doing.    I mean its one thing to take the phone away but it is totally another to to keep it on, go through it and intercept messages like that.       Teens:   1.What do you do when your parents take your cell phone away?    Do you give them the whole thing?    Do you take the battery?    Do you lock it?    Erase the messages?   2.What if you found out that your parents were intercepting text messages like that?   3.What do you think about this?            I know the whole her parents pay for they can do whatever they want thing but there is such thing as common decency and not totally invading privacy like that. When my phone was taken away, my mom kept it off and it went into a nightstand in her room. (Oops, how do I know that?)      Parents:    1. When you take your teens cell phone away what do you do with it?   Do you just shut it off and hide it somewhere?    Do you go through it(contacts, pics, messages) and then shut it off? Do you keep it on and see what comes through?   What if your teen shut it off and then handed it to you?    What if you turned it on and found it locked?    What if you saw the inbox and outbox empty?   Would you ever intercept messages like that?         I know it may seem like a lot but it is not.    I am just curious because what happened with my friend is outrageous to me.

20090222115401AAC4mf8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I'm scared & paranoid for the safety of my baby?	Before I was completely oblivious to everything and anything going on around me. I never watched the news channel...heck I didn't even know what channel it was on or anything. I was in my early 20s partying...studying...and that's pretty much it.      Well..I'm married now..with a 10 mth old daughter...and I've been watching the news every morning practically all day..everyday. What's got me paranoid...is these bizarre cases that I hear about on tv....      One case where natural apple juice killed 2-3 babies..because the fruit picker picked an apple off of the ground and the company was dedicated to "natural" apple juice so they didn't do a certain step that didn't completely kill bacteria...etc.etc...samonella..      Two recent ones are the peanut butter company and the weird lady found at the shopping center inserting weird liquid into baby foods.       Seriously...these things are really getting to me. How the heck am I supposed to know that the food that I buy natural or not is okay and safe for my baby?! There are nutcases out there doing weird outrageous things...and companies that try to cut corners. GEEZ..help someone...anyone else worried about these things?

20090222115504AAHECc5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	OKay.. to end this breastfeeding/ formula feeding debate... question for breastfeeding moms (KINDA LONG SORRY)?	What is that really upsets you about moms who formula feed?  Is it because it seems as if they think formula is best and don't realize the benefits of breastfeeding?       If I said that i formula feed by choice - and my choice being that i have done it because i was unprepared to be a mommy and had so much anxiety about it... in addition to postpartum depression.. I formula fed so i could take medication to help me provide my son with the best care.  And so that my husband could help - who also thought in our situation formula feeding would be best.       I KNOW that breast is best.. and i give all mommies who do it so much credit!  With my next I'm going to try it.. now that I am comfortable with caring for a newborn... and have learned so much as a mommy and how there are benefits with breastmilk that my son could never get with formula feeding.        However, there are still benefits to formula feeding... but even formula companies tell you on the can that 'breastmilk is best.'  So basically.. is it the moms who won't give it a chance just because they don't feel like it that bother you?  Sorry.. im just curious.  I've gotten thumbs down for my answers simply because the world formula was in it...       THANKS :)

I'm reposting this question b/c i got so few answers before:      I just answered a question about three girls playing with matches, and the mom of two of the girls spanked them pants-down, which I think is okay considering how dangerous matches can be. But it got me to think a little…the girls were different ages but got the same spanking. If you were the mom, would you spank exactly the same? Or would you give them both the same number of slaps but make them harder slaps for the older one? Or would you give the older one more spanks? If you’re a mom, then what do you do when you have to spank more than one child for being naughty and making sure the spankings are fair?.
20090222152828AAr32xO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	My daughter is having trouble adapting to the move?	In December my husband, kids and I moved from Arizona to California. For my 1 year old, 6 year old, 11 year old  and 13 year old it was their second move of the year (we had moved from Georgia to Arizona in early '08 because of a job offer. A month later I met my husband and we married. I had our twins in August '08. He has a daughter from a previous marriage.). This time we're moving for good. My husband has a job here and it's solid.      Everyone at first was having trouble with the move. We're closer to my family and my husband's, but we missed our family in Arizona and our friends and our church. But by now everyone seems happy here. All of my kids made new friends and they keep in touch with the old ones back home in Arizona and even still keep in touch with their friends from Georgia. Everyone seems happy.      Except for my 13 year old daughter.      She is the one who most was dreading the move. In Georgia she barely had any friends, but in Arizona she had tons and she loved it! She even had her first boyfriend (they broke up before we moved though. Like five months prior.)! And now in California she's really unhappy.      She hasn't made a single friend. I've tried inviting the neighborhood girls her age over, and nothing seems to work. She just doesn't want to be friends with anyone. I try talking to her and she says "I wish I could just be in Arizona! I hate you for making me move!" and then goes upstairs and hides away in her room until my husband comes home and talks to her (they're very close).       I feel really bad. I know we had to move, the job's so much better and the house we got is bigger and it fits our big family and they have better schools in this town. But I feel bad. Before my step-daughter (who is 14), my 13 year old was my oldest and we were close. Now she wants nothing to do with me.      What should I do? I want her to be happy!

Has anyone else gotten horrible acne as a result of being pregnant/ not being on the pill?  Throughout my pregnancy I had really bad acne and now my baby is 4 months old and I am nursing, so I cannot go back on estrogen birth control (which I believe would help the acne).  Since giving birth, my acne has gotten even worse.  Has anyone else experienced this, and what have you done about it?  I have tried topical erythromycin and finacea.  Nothing has worked.

Formula issues.?	i dont think my son has a milk protien allergy he isnt cranky, gassy, or have any other problem, other then the spitting up.  the dr suspect Reflux.  The spitting up is very common but He spits up alot... my second son had reflux too.  i just dont know what formula to keep him on.  if he did have a bad reaction to milk based he would be cranky by now, right? he has been on the A.R for 5 days now. and the only difference is he is spittin up chunky.  It could be the added rice in the formula.  he went poop just fine with A.R. i just dont know what formula to use.  with the Prosobee he spit up alot and it was more watery with the A.R its chunky.  the dr gave me meds for it, but im so scared to give him it.

20090222104514AAuHyRO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why does my infant want to feed every time I hold him?	My 3 week old son is constantly hungry these days. He used to go hours before he would breastfeed and now he can only go at the most 2 hours before feeding again and even then he normally wants to feed before that. Every time I pick him up to cuddle with him he thinks it's time to feed. My family members will be holding him and he'll be content but the second they pass him back to me he starts rooting and getting fussy. I feel like he thinks that's all I'm good for! LOL! I was just cuddling him and he woke up and starting rooting on me even though I had just fed him not even 30 minutes ago. He eats well---normally 10+ minutes and I know he's getting enough milk because I can hear him gulping it and he's gaining weight and having a healthy amount of dirty and wet diapers. Any suggestions/ideas? Or am I just destined to be only a milk machine for him?

It was so bad that Children's Hospital put him in rice cereal at 8 weeks!! He's fine, made it without choking, lol. Anyway, he had to sleep sitting up and so we started this thing where we would put him in car seat and put the car seat with him in it in his crib. We did this so he would get used to sleeping "in his crib". Well, it worked out fine while he was still a baby baby. Now he's 15 months old and cramped in his car seat and refuses to sleep laying down in his crib. I can't keep letting him sleep in his seat, I mean he's 25 and some change pounds, 34 inches long, and he's sleeping in a infant car seat.          Any ideas on getting him to sleep in his bed? I'm about out of hair and ideas, lol.
20090222141314AAxjO5n	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why do people tell everyone to wait until marriage?	There are those people on here who have questions about sex, and they say their age and then some people answer saying to wait until marriage.      Since when is it guaranteed that everyone will get married?  I respect anyone who plans on waiting until marriage, that's awesome and more power to them, but I know a lot of people who don't even want to get married.  My cousin is 27 and not married... was he supposed to stay a virgin that whole time?  I have a friend who is 25 and not married, was he supposed to stay a virgin?  And neither of them plan on getting married either.      And people say you should wait until marriage because it won't be a big deal if you get pregnant and you won't get an STD.  What if the couple doesn't want kids or someone cheats?  Then you could still end up with an unwanted pregnancy or an STD.      How do you feel about that?   AND NO. I am not trying to diss anyone who is waiting until marriage.  But abstinence aside, what do you think?

So whats with all these Mommies that have babies that sleep through the night?

So how many of you Moms have babies that sleep through, and if that's the case how on Earth did you get them to?!

20090222140923AAyTuLG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby Sleeping Questions!!?	My baby girl is a great baby, but I just have some questions about her sleeping patterns at night. She only wakes up once during the night, depending on what time we go to sleep. Usually we'll go to bed around 10-11 and she'll wake up around 2-4 to eat and get her diper changed. BUT here's the problem. She'll eat about 10 minutes on each side (she's a very good eater, and my milk flow is almost too good). I burp her inbetween sides and then rock her and cuddle her and NOTHING gets to go to sleep! She'll start crying for not even a minute, then out of no where fall asleep.   *****ANY TIPS??   Also, *****when does a baby stop waking up in the middle of the night? Or does that not happen? I have no idea, I'm a first time mommy!      Thanks!
20090222125211AADhbIi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	How well would Aubrey wear on a boy?	I've been running boys' names past my husband (since he's not a huge fan of any names on my current list) and I've found that Aubrey is a name we both like.  It's originally a masculine name meaning "elfin king" and up until the 1970's it was more common for boys than girls.        However, in the last 30 years its use on girls has skyrocketed.  It still ranked in the top 1000 for boys until 2002 -- and while I imagine there are still male Aubreys being born today, there aren't enough to show up on the SSA charts.      So, what do you think of using Aubrey on a boy?  Is it masculine enough that we could still get away with it?  Or has it completely gone to the girls (like Ashley and Madison)?

My little guy is 8 days old, breastfed and he often feeds to the point of throwing up.  Not just spitting up, I have seen that in my twins... this is worse like projectile throwing up.  :-(  He then wants to nurse more and nothing will satisfy him until he feeds again and then the same thing, he throws up.  :(  He doesn't have a fever and it doesn't happen with every feeding but it happened a lot last night and I was worried.  We were up until 1 AM repeating this scenario.      Any advice would help.        He is wetting and pooping plenty so I'm not worried about anything serious.  He is in a good mood the majority of the time so I don't think he is sick.  I think I am having some supply issues or something.

20090222141331AAaVRuL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Co-Sleepers ... advice please?	Ok so my son is now 9 and a half months old and his doctor has said he has the mental and physical development of a 12 month old. He can walk and talk etc. Anyway for the past 3 months we have been co sleeping and we are not really happy about it anymore because our son is too much of a messy sleeper he changes position a million times a night and kicks and hits us. We are moving interstate and are going to leave his cot behind to save on relocating costs, basically because he hasnt used it in months (He won't even nap in there anymore)    I really really want him to have his own bedroom in our new house but I am thinking about getting him a single bed with a barrier.    What do you think? As I said he can walk and he knows how to get off a bed without falling.    I've just never heard of a 10 month old baby in a proper bed but I can't justify spending more money on a cot he probably won't sleep in....   Any advice muchly appreciated, thanks!!

20090222124422AAlhd5W	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Any other new moms just become single and find out they're pregnant?	I'm a 21 year old with a 9 1/2 month old daughter, her dad and I are not getting along at all, he's completely going down the wrong path and there's no way I'm dragging my daughter and I along with him. He's moving out March 1st. We just found out that I'm 5 weeks pregnant, due on October 23rd. In my heart I want this baby more than anything in the world. But then my mind is telling me that I should have an abortion because there's no way I'd be able to make it on my own as a single mom of 2 new babies. It's tearing me completely apart because having an abortion just goes against everything I believe in. I feel so resentful towards my ex because we've been together for 4 years now, and we planned on having this beautiful family and getting married and happily ever after.. but then in a matter of a month and a half it all went down the drain, he had a complete change of heart.      I just would like to hear some stories of anyone that's been in a similar situation, or knows of anyone that had to make a decision like mine... whether it ended with abortion, or ended with another beautiful baby.

20090222125730AAfZSTa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Opinion pregnant or not?	I wanted to ask this question before I set up an Doc's Appointment. My cycles are pretty regular for the most part. My last period my January 17th and lasted for 4 days. This month my period was due on the 14th. I am now 8 days late. I have done pregnancy tests basically everyday this week and all came out negative. I have also had mild cramping on and off throughout the day everyday for the past 3 days but still no period (excuse me if this is disgusting but when I get the cramps it seems to be just gas). I had swollen breasts glands at the top of my breasts similar to the way it was when I breast fed my first child but that seems to have disappeared and just a little bit tender. I am going crazy. Could I be pregnant? Has anyone received negative pregnancy test 8 days past due period to receive positive later?

20090222142004AAsbZ0d	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnancy signs...am seeing the doctor in a week but was overly curious! any ideas? sore nipples,brown blood..?	I have been having pregnancy symptoms I believe, but just want to make sure from other people's opinions and personal experiences... My fiance and I have been sexually active for a while with the 'pull out' method. We would not be disappointed if I were to get pregnant because we are getting married very soon. Please let me know if these are symptoms.. or symptoms of something else:   I had a period on the 29th of Jan that lasted 4 days (and the normally last at least 6). then two weeks after I started spotting pink/mostly brown blood only when I wipe... I am EXTREMELY moody and emotional lately, bloated, very sore nipples, still spotting irregularly, exhaustion, and I have new blue veins that go towards my nipples that have never been there before. I was supposed to get my real period again at the end of the month, but have been having this bleeding going on. Any suggestions?      I am visiting my doctor on friday to ask, but wanted other's input, thanks!

20090222143551AAyBeLu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What do you do when you're so madly in love and you think they like you too?	Well im not in love.. but you know when you have a huge crush on a person and they are in your head constantly and you smile every time someone brings up their name.   Well thats what im going through now! And we text each other constantly and i think he likes me too. His friends always joke about us being together and he says im gorgeous etc. But none of us have actually made a move yet. Well ive only known the guy for a week but my feelings for him are so strong, but i dont want to just come out and tell him how i feel..    How can i tell if he likes me?   What do you think i should do to sort of make a move without actually making one!      Ive just broke up with my boyfriend this weekend, and i think deep down its because of the other guy. Cause we had a silly argument but i said i dont want to see him any more. And i dont, i dont have feelings for him really and i havent for a while. But this new guy knows ive only just broke up with him. And i dont know what to do cause i dont want people to think im moving on too quickly. I dont usually, but me and my ex were in a situation where it could end at any time. So im not being heartless by moving on so quickly. Im just so in "love" with this new guy!.      Anyone got any advice?
20090222142218AA1zfAk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Do people view thumb sucking as an 'insecurity' or 'self-soothing'?	I have always heard people refer to thumb sucking as an 'insecurity'.

20090222143237AAT6c2h	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Flu, bug or food poisoning -- 11 month old?	we just went on a family vacation to florida and the night before we left, 4 of us got struck with what we thought was food poisoning. we had all tried some of the same food and seemed to get sick within minutes of each other. luckily, my 11 month old was fine (as was my brother and grandmother). they had not eaten the suspected food. after a horrible flight home with us all getting over this, we were OK. but now, 2 days later, my daughter vomitted in the middle of the night last night, and twice today. other than the vomitting, she seems like herself--fine, playful. come to find out, my brother and grandmother both had the same symptoms last night as well. does this sound like a virus bug, or a bacterial thing that we could have spread while we were all sick? i called the on call doctor and she just said to keep her hydrated and call in the morning if i needed to bring her in, but it just has me wondering. anyone have any insight?

20090222143413AAkg9Zj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	I need to talk to our childminder tomorrow and don't know what to say. help?	Our 20 month old son has recently started going to a childminder who has been really good and my son has settled nicely there. We made it clear from the beginning what he is and isn't allowed to eat and diluted fruit juices, crisps, sweets, cakes, cookies... are not allowed except on occasions such as birthdays etc...   last week, however, when i came to pick him up he was just finishing a packet of crisps. i didn't say anything at the time because he hadn't been eating well all week and i was just happy to see him eat something.   the following day when i arrived, the child minder had a couple of guests over and they were all having cake and coffee. in the 10 min that i was there he had a cookie, a little cake and some diluted fruit juice. i didn't feel comfortable saying anything in front of her guests so didn't say anything.      now i'm not sure what to say tomorrow morning but i need to say something. i'm a bit nervous (i know i shouldn't be but i still am) and i'm not sure what a good way to raise my concerns are. any ideas or experience?      thanks!
20090222142325AAHtMol	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Help with my sisters and a room?	Hi,   Im 12 years old and i NEVER had my own room.

I asked my sister liz on the phone and she said "Thats a STUPID idea!"   And i just really want my own room.   I mean i have to put my clothes into my mom and dads room! (Were not poor dont worry.)   WE would switch rooms and clothes and everything.      1.Do you htink this is a dumb idea?   2. How do i convince my sister to let us switch?
20090222143730AA5XwiX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Am I wrong here.....?	My family and I recently moved from Arizona to California. Our new neighbors seem really nice. They have three kids that are 14, 11 and 7, so they play with my kids. The other day their parents asked me to watch the 7 year old while the mom was at the spa, the dad was and work and the oldest two went to acting class. I said sure because my 1, 11, 13 and 14 year old would all be out with my husband for the day and I'd only have my six month old twins and 6 year old at home and my 6 year old gets along great with their 7 year old.      Now I don't have a billion rules, but I do have a few. For example, don't be rude and you must eat all snacks in the kitchen or at the table in the living room and if you must eat upstairs, eat on a blanket, desk or if you have a table in your room, eat on there. I always tell the rules to the child when he or she come in, if they are first time guests.       So anyway, the neighbor came over and things seemed to be going well. The boys played in my son's room and they seemed to be having fun. I came upstairs to go check on them and found them in the upstairs TV room. They were watching Desperate Housewives (I guess they found it on the DVR recordings. Like I said I have two teenagers. They love the show.). I turned it off as that show isn't very appropriate for six and seven year olds. I told them not to watch it. They promise and I turn on Nickolodean. I go back downstairs. When I come up again to say it's lunch time, I find my six year old in his room playing and the seven year old in the TV room. He's watching Desperate Housewives. I said "What did I tell you about this show?" and he said "I don't care!". I told him that if I caught him watching it again, he'd be put in time out. They came downstairs and this time I  made them stay downstairs to watch TV, so I could keep an eye on them. I go to get my 1 year old up from her nap and when I come back in the room, my son is in the bathroom and the 7 year old is watching TV. And he's watching.....DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES! I turn off the TV and put him in time out. Everything went smoothly after that. The boys didn't watch TV and they played quietly in the living room.      So later that night at like midnight I get a call and it's the boy's mother. And she's yelling at me for putting her son in time out! She said she doesn't punish her son that way, she simply would just scold him. I tell her "I'm sorry, but I told him twice not to watch the show!" and then I asked "Do you allow to watch that show anyway?" and she said "No! Of course not!"      I think the punishment was acceptable and necessary.       Am I wrong here?

Have friends with a son named "Dylan" so considering not naming our daughter, "Daylen".  Another spelling of "Daelyn" is an option, however, wouldn't want it mispronounced as "Day-Ellen" or her given a nick name of "Dayle".  Phoebe seems a bit easier to deal with and not in the mainstream of names either.  Between the two name choices, we like Daylen Nicole or Daylen Celeste or Phoebe Nicole or Phoebe Celeste.  Any thoughts?
