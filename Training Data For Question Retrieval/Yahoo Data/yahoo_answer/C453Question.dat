I have not changed my usage habits and the bill was based on an actual reading (same as last time).

There is the "hot" red wire and three different colored wires, each going to the corresponding unit.  The door bells I have have two connections.  My understanding is to hot wire the first, then run the hot to the second and third.  Then attach the wire that send the signal to the bell to each of the buttons, (on the other side of the hot connection.  As soon as I touched the red to any one of the unit wires it worked.  But when I attached the red to the ringer or button then the units wire the buzzer would ring constantly.  I'm looking at it as a simple circuit being completed when the button is pressed.  Why am I constantly getting a buzz without pressing the button to complete the circuit.  I was told by someone with I consider a good handyman that because the buttons I installed are LIGHTED, they are a pain in the #$3% and many times not compatible with old wiring.  Is this true?  Again when I manually touch the red to any one of the units wires, no problem.   The buzzers ring in the units.  I planed on connecting the power to the first , then jumping it to the second, and then the third.  Then connecting the units wire, ( I think I already said this) Can anyone give me any info on this.  Thanks.
