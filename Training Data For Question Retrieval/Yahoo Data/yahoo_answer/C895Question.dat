20090203120130AAUTqJ4	Business & Finance;Credit	Question about a collection agency claiming I owe them money for a past bank account?	I got a call from a collection agency claiming they were representing IBC bank for a closed account I had from 2001 and that I owed them $672 because of it.       I'm confused because this is the first I've heard, I have an account with IBC now and they have never said anything about me owing them money and I'm positive I didn't leave my last account in the negative.       When I asked the agent if I should call IBC and ask them about it, he said they probably would not have the information anymore and insisted that I pay them as soon as possible, then it wouldn't be on my credit report. He even offered a discount rate but I did my credit report last year and this wasn't on it.       So I'm confused, does this sound like a scam? The agency is called Talbott, Adams and Moore and they do have a website. Why would the bank not have any information on old overdue accounts, and why wouldn't they just come after me? Instead they let me open a new account?

20090225024518AA2yCeH	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Financial Services	Should I go for my Passion or for the $ ?	Given the job market situation, should I continue to try to start my own business (my passion), or should I play it safe and get a job?        I can't do both and am ok for money for at least 18 months.      The company I am trying to start is doing something I really enjoy doing, but only have indirect experience in this field. Also given the market situation, I don't know if I can put money on the table.      Option 2 : my work experience is extremely strong in a similar by unrelated area.   I have been contacted by a company and will get paid to do what I've always done which I'm good at and can make a very good income (I assume this is still the case despite the financial markets).  If I take on a job, I can't do both and there's no way to move towards my passion with the jobs it is easier for me to get.      So, should I go for my passion with the risk of no money, or should I get a job in an area I am good at and can get paid, and continue to wonder if I could ever make it in the other business of interest?

Looking for suggestions on how to move the bank along with the process. Should I call and tell them to push the foreclosure along?

Now, to raise funds, their shares will be effectively degraded another 20% as a capital raising adventure starts.  Suncorp-Metway intend to dilute the current share base by offering shareholders a share per five held at $4.50.  Where does Suncorp-Metway get the authorisation to simply "print off" more shares?      The Board has stated that John Mulcahy has led Suncorp-Metway to an immeasurably stronger position for resources and capability.  Really?  Then why have I alone lost tens of thousands of dollars trusting this person and the Board.  They'll need to raise a little extra for John's going away package.  What can we do about it?

20090225020956AAtoWCu	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	How do I go about requesting a phone interview for jobs?	I'm applying for jobs in another city (about two hours away from where I live) and I'm wondering how (or if) I should request a phone interview when/if potential employeers contact me for an interview.      I'm applying for pretty basic jobs (mostly admin. with entry-level salaries) so the odds of them agreeing to a phone interview seems slim. But it'd make my life easier. :)      Should I mention in my cover letter that I'd prefer a phone interview if it comes to that (seems like a bad idea, really...); wait for them to call and THEN ask? Or should I just suck it up and drive the 2 1/2 hours for any potential interviews?      Thing is, the trip'll cost me about $50 in gas. Not a fortune, no, but if I end up NOT getting hired, that's $50 I'll never see again.      Anyway, any thoughts?

Ever since then I have kept all of my payments up to date and never missed any.  I have contacted Welcome to see how much I owe. Now they say my loan wont be paid until April 2010 as extra charges occured from my late payment. If this is true I will be paying over ￡600 more than I oringinally thought.  Is there any way of reducing the interest charged by them as it seems very excessive. Or do I have any other options.
