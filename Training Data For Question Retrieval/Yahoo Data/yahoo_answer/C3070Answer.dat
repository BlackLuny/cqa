2Ypig4jBaa	Actually in those towns, of the 2 Santa Maria would be your best bet.<br>  <br>  Santa Maria is a much larger city.  It is about 3 times larger than Hollister.  So there is likely to be more than 3 times as many tech jobs.<br>  I just did a look up on Craigslist of job postings in each and that shows this to be true.|`|R9zaR2mQaa	I never really equate Hollister with Tech jobs.  Maybe Morgan Hill if you want to stay out of the San Jose Metro area, but not Hollister.  I'm sure they exist to some extent, but it definitely not the first thing that comes to mind.  I know nothing about Santa Maria, but I thought I'd throw in my $.02
FNMMm7Dnaa	better try goleta or santa barbara
gaXUIduMaa	You saw the trailer for the movie Sunshine Cleaning didn't you?  You shouldn't need anything more than a business license and whatever a professional cleaning service needs.  Connections with the local police departments would be a must.  <br>  As a suggestion, there is more money if a business emergency cleaning service.  There you clean up stuff like water damage from burst water pipes, fire and the like.  Businesses also will pay better and faster than the individual homeowners would (the police does not pay for this).
UFjMBfodaa	I would check out eVenues.com. The site is like a hotels.com for temporary meeting space (exactly what you are looking for). It's pretty easy to use and you can rent any type of meeting room or temporary space by the day or hour.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :o)
UFjMBfodaa	I think I just answered this same question for you in another forum, but try eVenues.com. It is like a hotels.com for temporary meeting rooms. You can rent space by the day or hour. Otherwise try a local meeting planner, they may be able to help you out.<br>  <br>  :o)

RD7A4NAtaa	I think you'd be in a position to kick up a stink with this one!<br>  <br>  When you take the agreement, it's all printed in black and white; terms and conditions, interest rates, due date / installment dates, blah, blah, blah.<br>  <br>  If they have broken the contract by charging you interest before the due date, the word "compensation" comes to mind!<br>  <br>  Returning broken / faulty goods?<br>  Never had a problem within their 30 day money back guarantee.<br>  Outside of this time, they're not too keen about taking it back, but talk "consumer rights" and they're pretty good at making a deal.

You could also try places like Swift Thrift etc.  You never know what you could find there ... could be something brand new!  What size are you??
hIqCpiXKaa	Contact microsoft via phone. They will other send you to a place where you can drop off your xbox or send you a box to ship it to them in order to have it repaired. Hopefully your warranty hasn't expired if it has it will cost you somewhere around 100-200 bucks. It also takes 4-6 weeks to repair. If you arnt under warranty I would get a quote from microsoft and another repair center. They will probably be about the same, it might be more beneficial for you to have it fixed at a local shop so that you don't have to wait 4-6 weeks. Best of Luck.
vY9lIRjaaa	question is unclear, can you please add more details
33D9CDWwaa	There's a new(ish) Fedex operation in Kennesaw GA.<br>  And I heard that a food place is opening up (packaging company type deal, but I dont know the name and cant find it with a quick google).<br>  and I think that gambling casino thing got approved to go where Underground Atlanta is.<br>  The department of corrections i think is starting to hire.

tV7ZYIeEaa	Have you tried a car max? one by the airport. Try to stay away from small used car dealerships that's where you can get scammed.|`|aHER8myJaa	well certainly NOT from a dealer... best is to find a private seller and take whoever you know that knows most about cars with you to look at it. Try the newspaper or autotrader. What kind of car are you looking for?|`|sAJfK0K4aa	Try www.carsala.com. Once you know what car you want, they'll locate it for you in whatever area you live. They then call up dealerships in your area and have professional negotiators negotiate a price for you, which tends to be about 25% off Kelley Blue Book. Then you can just go test drive it, and if you like it, buy it with the price Carsala got for you. It's easy and fast--usually takes 2-3 days to get the car and negotiate the price.
