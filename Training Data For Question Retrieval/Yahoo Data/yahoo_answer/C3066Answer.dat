PuVgZiddaa	Contact you better business bureau (the phone number is in the government section of your local phone book usually in the blue pages) and find out it they have a legitimate tax ID number.  If they are not real or are fraudulently doing business make sure you file a formal complaint. So this does not happen to someone else.|`|cE1esUotaa	Go to this link (below) and search any company (or even person's) name. If there's dirt on them, it will present it in a few seconds, with specifics.<br>  www.ripoffreport.com

gaXUIduMaa	I don't think they have costumes but the Universal Studios store in City walk should have some of the other trinkets.  It is outside the park so all you need to do is either pay for parking or park at the subway station on Lankershirm and take their tram to the upper level.|`|00390bee0bdfb56e0334bd2845fadd9aaa	<a href="http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=rent+costumes&ns=1&rpp=10&find_loc=los+angeles+ca" rel="nofollow">http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=ren...</a>

PnPVoakoaa	you can do your taxes free online   www.taxact.com<br>  <br>  They will charge you if you file online but doing your taxes is free - you can print your return and mail it in.  you can do your state return as well.|`|paerqxfMaa	Why don't you just go online to the IRS website and e-file.  You can probably get away with doing a 1040EZ and it's quick and easy - the site asks the questions they need to - mulitple W-2's is not an issue.  It gets sent, you get notification that it was sent, you get notified that the IRS has accepted it and you get notified of when to expect your refund.  Piece of cake!  Forgot to mention, it's free!|`|AA10594268	I have a sheet with a list of where to get taxes done free. give me your e-mail you it. reply to ASAP. <br>  cross83dc@yahoo.com
prahKrpjaa	Morons, he's not moving to Detroit, he's moving to Belleville.<br>  <br>  If you're moving here, why wouldn't you buy a car?  <br>  <br>  Except for the job market and the 3 feet of snow we get between Dec and March, Michigan is a great area.  The people are fantastic, we have all 4 major sports (if you call the Lions major! LOL!), and lots of great suburbs.   No earthquakes, an occasional tornado, and the spring, summer, and fall are awesome (can you tell I'm not a winter fan?)<br>  <br>  We have an incredible amount of golf courses, I believe the most per capita, and are a heck of a lot cheaper than anything in California.  And being in Belleville, you're pretty close to Ann Arbor, which has a great down town.|`|3giaPYe8aa	Public transportation would be the SMART Bus, but I'm not sure if they are available in the Belleville area.  You could GOOGLE it and check.  I have no idea why you would even want to move to Michigan.  Things are pretty bad here, right now.|`|w6RMoMSXaa	its detriot. . . what can u do? u can walk down the street and get mugged. or u can call a taxi and the will mugg u for a additional fee. or u can sit in your house and prepare for a "b and e".im in the walled lake area and its fine but bellvile is fine to. just make sure u lock your car!!!! car hoping is super popular here. taxi cap fares are a little more expensive than before because of the michigan econimy. nobody wants the automotive industries to be bailed out, but like 40% income of michigan is because of those industries. so if i see u. . . i may have to mugg u lol|`|CSDlp4Igaa	dont move to detroit<br>  its a dump <br>  <br>  yull get mugged and killed <br>  <br>  trust me, ive live there<br>  <br>  its not a pretty place

Check under "new age", "metaphysical" and other such terms.|`|yAvTxh47aa	There are a couple, but I find them fairly lame...okay, really really lame. You'll do better just shopping at the fair trade and boutique places on Allen and/or Elmwood.<br>  <br>  Here's the shops listing for New York State:<br>  <a href="http://www.witchvox.com/vn/sh/usny_sh.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.witchvox.com/vn/sh/usny_sh.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Frankly, I've been thinking of opening one up, since the ones we have are tourist traps.<br>  <br>  There is also a completely unimpressive Buffalo Pagans mailing list on yahoo groups.|`|4nM0bbXzaa	I'm not sure how any of these are, but these are the closest I could find to Buffalo:<br>  <br>  The Sacred Circle (Batavia)<br>  Diana's New Age Boutique (Bethany)<br>  Wendy's Wings (Caledonia)<br>  Amy K's Mystic Corner (Lewiston)<br>  Herbal Magick Inc.

PqSRXtw9aa	There used to be a shop just off Carnaby street (which is a short walk from Oxford Street, take the road which is next to the station opposite Top shop called Argle Street and Carnaby St is behind Libertys) . The shop is called Skate of Mind. I haven't been up there for a while so I'm not sure if its still there or not, but might be worth checking out. There is a large Quiksilver store on Regent Street too.
