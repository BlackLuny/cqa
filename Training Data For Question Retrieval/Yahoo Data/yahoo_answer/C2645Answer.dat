I like dogs, especially puppies.|`|AA10055682	No... you can't really tell from a photo, or even in person.  It's possible that someone with more experience with wolf-dogs might know what traits to look for, but it would be anatomical things rather than just appearance.  There are many breeds and mixes of dog that can have a very wolf-like appearance, so it's unlikely that a stray canine will be a wolf-dog even if she appears rather wolfy.|`|16668b9d558f1fe179a12d76976df8c6aa	Take her to a vet they can tell you.

You will need to take your new dog for a checkup at the vet anyway, so ask the vet, but it is very, very unlikely.    If the dog is part wolf by some rare chance, this will not make it a worse dog to have. It's all in the training.

Cats reach sexual maturity around the ages of 5-7 months and female cats caterwaul (howl) to let male cats know she is receptive to be mated.

gV9ABqA1aa	Beagles are notorious for having dominance aggression problems, usually with other dogs, but sometimes with human owners and handlers when other dogs are not present.  There is also an epileptic genetic disorder that makes them extremely aggressive for no apparent reason and without warning, they are not aware of the aggressive outbursts (it's a seizure) and they are not doing it on purpose.  It was previously only seen in Springer spaniels and was called "Springer Rage Syndrome", now it has been documented in Beagles, German Shepherds, and some other breeds and is just termed "rage syndrome".  I do not think your dog is displaying this, the outbursts would be much much more violent if he was, and directed at anyone or anything near him at the time since he would be unaware of them and unable to direct them toward a specific target.  I only make mention of it so that if the aggression starts to escalate or become completely unpredictable, you have an idea of what may be wrong and know to take him to the vet.  In order to help your dogs with the dominance aggression, you should enroll them both in obedience training together, and make a point of working with the beagle and trainer one-on-one to make YOU the ultimate leader of your household in the beagle's eyes and not him.  I would not try this alone, trying to alter the dog's established heirarchy to suit yourself without the help of a professional can lead to serious fights.  In the meantime, until you get professional help, try to avoid anything that makes the beagle agggressive, even if that means not giving them favorite treats like pig ears, or only giving them to the dogs when they are enclosed in separate rooms.|`|AA11632563	yes kennels work... i have 2 dogs inside my home. they grew up together so they share most of the time... at nights and when were not home they go to their kennels. all we say is room and they go. my black lab goes in there by him self  every nite  at 9... i guess its his way of sayin  bedtime..lol|`|8147395e73658c3b1f6afcfc7a5c88beaa	the best thing to do is watch them closely when they are playing..... also you want to teach the selfish dog  to share. you can try to with a deep tone in your voice saying NO when you see him ready to bite. also there is other humain ways of displine you can try|`|zX2Ce5dYaa	Try a squirt gun.  Shoot at the beagle whenever it goes after the puggle.  Don't let the beagle know you are the one shooting him.  And yes crating does work|`|7kFbnLq8aa	You seem to be having a bit of an alpha war going on. You need to stop your beagle from going after the puppy. For a while, don't let them play unsupervised. Keep them in a smaller confined area so you can intervene if necessary. If you see ANY aggressive behavior (watch ears, tail and overall body language) in your beagle you must stop it before he bites again. Spray bottles are good, but I think it's OK to let him see it's you. You are the pack leader after all, and you should be able to discipline your "pack" when you need to.    Or you can physically get between the dogs and tell the beagle (most likely the offender) NO! You don't have to touch him but stand firm. Or use a hand to "bite" your beagle in the neck area. You can also use a sound (ala Cesar Millan) to get the beagle's attention. Whichever method you choose it needs to be clear to the beagle that this is unwanted behavior. Your puppy will become fearful and possibly aggressive in the future if it thinks it always needs to defend itself.     Another thing you can do is to walk them together so they understand that they are part of the same pack. This will bond you and your dogs.    Obedience training is a another great way to socialize, bond and train your dogs. It also helps to establish you as the leader.    Not sure what you mean by crating in this context. Separating them will not help in the long run.     Good luck!|`|AA11882315	I have a puppy.
XnXbPYd5aa	It sounds like a seizure.  She may have a form of epilepsy, which is quite treatable with medication.   Licking her paws afterward strongly suggests epilepsy.    Or she could have a metabolic imbalance.  A blood test would  give more information.    Take her to the vet and give him a full careful description of these spells she has because he won't be able to observe them first-hand.   (Your question gave good details.)|`|0dfe281e79bce2a959f6fbb298117653aa	I agree with Candy, it sounds like seizures but you will need to take it to the vet for a correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The good thing is though that with medication, they can be controlled so that your dog has a relatively normal life especially as she is still such a young dog. Good luck!|`|pDGEcWacaa	She could be having secures- This can be extremely fatal is not taken to the vet soon. Hurry!|`|7340029a690679f351e9bba27dc01bbeaa	Could be a seizure or she may be in pain. Trembling, shaking or panting may indicate pain. If her head or eyes hurt she will scratch at them to make it stop. She'll need to be checked by a vet.|`|fKPxnac3aa	It could be fleas. My pekingese would do the same thing and it was because the fleas are mostly attracted to there head and right around the eyes. That is why she is scratching at her eyes and she is trembling and curling up because it is hurting them from the bites. So you need to treat for fleas. If your Pekingese doesnt have fleas then you need to take her to the vet ASAP.|`|Ci3mATqlaa	With a Pekingese this small, it could be a hypoglycemic episode. How often do you feed her?    Also could be digestive problems, the small ones sometimes suffer with intestinal problems.   Also, could be seizures, as Pekes can have these.  Also, Pekes with back problems will also shake with pain, or pain anywhere can make a Peke shake all over.   These are the best I can come up with after having Pekingese since 1955 and I now have a sleeve little girl and she has had a few of these problems.  You really should take her to the nearest vet and have her examined.  Charlotte  DahLing Pekingese  Ohio|`|wWDAWmBdaa	It could be seizures. Does she come out of it on her own or do you have to do anything to help her? Does she get better after eating? If so it could be low blood sugar. Toy dogs are very prone to low blood sugar reactions just like a diabetic especially if they are very small. One of my Chihuahua's was like this until he hits about 3.    I would check this out with your vet. It may well be nothing, but if it's something like epilepsy it needs to be treated right away to stop further seizures.|`|wEtpk2Mjaa	Go to the vet NOW!!

AA11343974	If your cat/dog ate rat poision or pet food with rat poision in it. please....TAKE YOU PET TO THE VET IMMEDIATELY.  Rat poision causes the blood vessels in the pet/human to rupture and they will bleed to death internally.  I worked in the Operating Room; and went to college for this.  The blood thinner that is given to humans (Coumadin) has a very small amt. of rat poision in it. That is why humans who are on blood thinner have to have labs done  frequently. It is only a tiny amt. used in blood thinner. But in rat poision it is a very, very strong amount. Your pet may not show any signs till it is too late.  PLEASE GET YOUR PET TO THE VET IMMEDIATELY.

The calories in that amount of food are sufficient for most "normal" sized cats. Of course a highly energetic cat will need more food to keep it healthy, and a lazy cat will need less food to keep it from getting obese. But 5.5 ounces of wet food per day is a good place to start.    Here is a fantastic site that will help you.    http://www.catinfo.org/    Cats were never meant to eat dry food, also known as cereals or kibble. We, humans, make them eat it for convenience to us. It has nothing to do with them or their nutritional needs. It's completely species inappropriate.     All small domestic cats descended from desert cats. In the wild, desert cats derive their entire liquid intake from their prey. They do not have a thirst mechanism because they don't need it when eating a species appropriate diet. They get all they need from what they eat. Additionally water was usually not available to them in their desert climate. So they do not often drink water. Regular ol' house cats have descended from those same wild desert cats.     So in a home environment, your kitty does not get the moisture it needs from dry food and its almost always in a constant state of dehydration. Water fountains are encouraged to TRY to get your cat to drink more and your kitty may even enjoy it, but it will never meet its water intake needs drinking from a bowl.     Deadly feline illnesses such as diabetes, kidney failure, obesity, allergies, Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD), constipation, bladder stones, kidney stones, urinary tract blockages and Urinary Tract Infections (FLUTD), with and without deadly crystals run rampant these days. Cats are not taking in enough water to stave them off. Proper water intake through a species appropriate diet alone can prevent most of these conditions.     Overall,  wet is all around better for any cats diet, be it canned or Raw and they should never be fed dry cereal kibble if we wish to most closely match their wild nutritional and dietary needs. Kibble meets our needs not our cats.    I recommend varying the diet with a constant rotation of 2 to 4 different brands of canned foods that your cat enjoys. If you do this, and allow your cat the same assortment they would have in nature when eating mice, bugs, birds and rabbits, your cats digestive system won't be so sensitive and you won't have to run around looking for a specific brand when your store is out. You will have a nice variety to choose from instead.     Canned foods I recommend you consider for your rotation:       Nature's Variety - http://www.naturesvariety.com/content.la...

We have two females, one weighs 18lb and one weighs 10lb, and they are both about 8 or 9 years old.    They each get a 3 oz can of Fancy feast in the AM, and then they get Royal Canin Indoor  37 about 4PM...the small cat gets 1/4 cup and the big cat gets about 1/2 cup. And they are thriving and not putting on any extra weight.    Good luck finding that happy medium for your cats. My vet helped me put together this feeding program so I could take my cats off of self-feeding. They were getting fat!|`|PLHuRalWaa	you should feed him 2ce a day and put 1/2 a med. packet of food in their bowl.|`|EMtgbFy0aa	For a healthy diet cats can eat 2-3 cups of food a day. If serving them dry food give them plenty of water on the side.  If you feed them to much they will be to over-weight and this can be very unhealthy for animals like cats. Good Luck! |`|kArnjho7aa	If you fed the right food for the species, you can let your cat dictate how much he/she needs. You are feeding kitty crack (dry food)        Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.    The best food for cats does not contain any grains at all.   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...     Please read about cat nutrition.                                   http://www.newdestiny.us/nutritionbasics...                                 http://www.catinfo.org/feline_obesity.ht...        http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...     Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...

A pet hotel will be nice too.|`|AA11729444	You should put your dog in a nice animal shelter. We travel alot in the summer and we put our dog in a animal shelter where they take the dogs out about 5 times a day, they get a walk everyday, also if u pay more they give them a bath one time they are there. Or else if there are no animal shelters near you, you should maybe give the dog to a close relative or friend. Before we found the shelter, we use to have one of my Uncles to take care of our dog. [it worked very well bc they had the same breed of our dog] :)     Hope i helped,  Gina |`|b60b6e8062f11f6cf697468a2c93558aaa	If your traveling and not able to take your dog w/you ~ you really have a couple options;    First, you can contact your local vet ~ alot of times they have the facilities to boards, if not they might have recommendations...    Secondly, if that is not an option, check your area for local kennels/shelters that do nothing but boarding.  But be sure when you are checking, you also check their references and credentials.  You can also check your area for local sitting services ~ someone who actually comes to your house and sits with your dog while you are gone ~ again, when doing so check references and credentials on all!!!      You can also contact local grooming services ~ alot of times they have resources not available to the public.      Remember though, whenever checking into a new service, ask about references, check with the Better Business Bureau (BBB), friends and family ~ you can never be tooo safe for your pets....|`|CbeN8WVaaa	If my boys can't go then I don't go.

Search the web for animal watchers. Its kind of expensive though.|`|bZsrX0Ytaa	They aren't "animal shelters", they are "kennels" or "boarding facilities" - don't look up "animal shelters" and expect to find somewhere to drop off a pet and pick it back up when you're done with your trip!
1203d31ab3bc3d0447a306d55a7bde5faa	Until he's better at taking care of his own needs cleanliness-wise, I'd shave the fur around his back end for a while.  It doesn't mean you have to do it forever - just until he's older and more capable of cleaning himself.  It will save both of you a lot of aggravation.  The fact that you aren't home sometimes just accentuates the need to help him along a bit.    If you can afford to do so, I suggest getting a Littermaid or similar automatic cat box; I have one, and it's a HUGE help, as long as there is GOOD quality litter in it (I use the Tidy Cats Crystal Blend as it helps absorb liquid, which helps keep ammonia from forming).    Good luck!|`|AA11582656	well you could give him what we call a potty trail, thats where you have the groomer or vet clinic shave some of the hair on his bottom, but just enough to keep the poo off his fur and to where his tail covers up hw short it may be in that area.|`|orbZdHMDaa	I have a Persian and usually I trim the fur around his bottom every now and then and a bit of fur on the tail.

AA10376032	I have three JRT's... they should not be left food at all times.  Feed her twice a day.  Give her only about 15 minutes at most to eat.  If she does not, take the food away.  When she is only offered food at certain times (and they should be consistent) she will eat.  If she does not eat it ALL, you may be feeding her too much.  Water though should always be available.|`|eDySIDPQaa	No, and leave fresh water down also, don't leave alot of food down, it will cause the dog to eat more and more if food is taken away....|`|14ad394512d542c10b924db2e8b09cb7aa	I love Jack Russels.

Be good to her.|`|P6qspidyaa	Dont allow the dog to "graze" when she eats. Put the food down and pick it up after a 1/2 hour. I feed twice a day. I would try again for her evening mean, this will help her get on a schedule and you can get her potty time on a schedule too, so there's never any fear that you are at work and she is holding her poop.

Bjss.|`|WpD2y8Joaa	No Brasil, hoje, temos diversos tipos de ra??o com qualidades diferentes.   Sendo assim, para facilitar o entendimento, vamos classific-las em trs grupos.    Ra??es Populares - S?o os produtos mais baratos que existem no comrcio. Normalmente formuladas com subprodutos de milho, soja, farelo de algod?o, etc. Tais ingredientes, na ra??o de uma vaca ou de um cavalo seriam de excelente digest?o, mas, voltando quela historinha, nosso amigo  um carnvoro, e precisa de protena de origem animal, pronta a ser assimilada pelo seu organismo    OBS.: Os vegetarianos de quatro patas tm a capacidade de transformar protenas e carboidratos de baixa qualidade em "produtos mais nobres". Os c?es e gatos precisam dos produtos nobres j prontos.    Ra??es "Standard" - S?o produtos de empresas de renome, que, na maioria das vezes, buscam atravs da mdia uma fatia maior do mercado consumidor. Por serem produtos de empresas maiores, tm um compromisso maior com a qualidade, e s?o formuladas com ingredientes qualitativamente melhores que as ra??es populares, ou seja, n?o s?o "t?o subprodutos" assim. Contm farinha de carne e ossos, glten de milho, gordura animal, etc. Porm ainda n?o s?o "ideais" a nvel de digestibilidade, mas s?o melhores que os "subprodutos". Quanto ao custo, est?o numa faixa intermediria de pre?o.    Ra??es Premium e Super Premium - S?o produtos de primeira qualidade em nutri??o canina, por isso mais caros. Tm sua formula??o baseada em carne de frango, ovelha, peru... Porm, realmente carne, ou resduos de abatedouro, como digestas de frango, por exemplo (o que  diferente dos "subprodutos"). Tais ingredientes, de origem animal, tm maior digestibilidade, ou seja, o trato digestivo canino tem menos "trabalho" para metaboliz-los. Esta  outra caracterstica das ra??es premium: como a digestibilidade  maior, o consumo dirio de ra??o  menor (o que ameniza o pre?o da ra??o). Promovem ainda uma vida mais saudvel, e reduzem o volume das fezes do animal.    As Ra??es super premium s?o assim classificadas a partir de um certo percentual de digestibilidade, o que pode variar de acordo com os interesses dos fabricantes, pois n?o h um "padr?o" neste sentido.     Como consumidor, para saber se a ra??o  de alta digestibilidade, ou n?o, basta analisar na embalagem os ingredientes que comp?em a ra??o. As fontes proteicas devem ser de origem animal (carne de frango, carne de peru, digestas de frango, carne de ovelha, ovos, etc.). E as fontes de gordura tambm, ou pelo menos leos vegetais nobres como, por exemplo, leo de linha?a. Fontes proteicas vegetais como soja, glten, etc. n?o tm alta digestibilidade.  bom desconfiar de produtos que tm em sua rela??o de componentes coisas como "carne de aves" (urub tambm  ave / e de que parte da ave est?o falando? Pena e bico s?o protena pura e de baixssima digestibilidade).     O que pode aumentar a digestibilidade da ra??o  a presen?a de fibras de moderada fermenta??o (p.ex. polpa de beterraba branca), que aumenta a eficincia absortiva dos entercitos. Outro ingrediente que melhora a digestibilidade s?o os F.O.S. (fruto oligo sacardeos), que alimentam a microbiota intestinal, ou seja, beneficia o crescimento de "boas bactrias" no intestino, o que leva a uma melhor fermenta??o do bolo alimentar.    Resumindo, quando compramos uma ra??o para o amigo peludo, devemos estar atentos aos nveis de garantia (percentuais de protena, gordura, etc.) e a qualidade dos ingredientes. Por exemplo, uma ra??o para cachorro deve ter, no mnimo, 18% de protena. O que  relativo, porque carne  fonte de protena, e pena da galinha tambm. Carne  bem mais digervel que pena. Outro detalhe  o equilbrio entre percentuais de protena e gordura. N?o  eficiente uma ra??o com 30% de protena e 8% de gordura, nem outra com 18% de protena e 20% de gordura.     Um quarto grupo de ra??es pode ser citado, as ra??es teraputicas. Tm indica??o clnica, sendo auxiliares no tratamento de diversas enfermidades. Seu uso deve obedecer os critrios do Mdico Veterinrio responsvel pelo c?o.|`|7e02407eda832a0e11f7c07f603b2bb4aa	Royal Canin  e a melhor|`|536d1ISIaa	As melhores s?o:  Royal Canin  Eukanuba  Tuttano

AA12055335	First off, it may take your Yorkie a bit of time to learn to use it, so if your dog doesn't get it right away don't get frustrated. What I did to pee pad my Chihuahua was, when he had an accident in the house off of the pee pad, I blotted it first with the pee pad, so that his scent was on it. Then cleaned it without making a fuss or commenting on it. When he would go potty on the pad, I would overly verbally praise him and give him a treat that was just for going on the pee pad. Over time I backed off to just verbally praising him for going on the pee pad and now after working on it for about 3 months, he is pee pad trained and accidents off of it are rare. But, when they do occur, I just clean them up without acknowledging him or scolding him.|`|IULW1CK8aa	Not at all ......take him for a walk instead.|`|NQjVlStQaa	You could use a nice smelling spray for dogs and lots of praise for using it. It is better to train him to go outside though
UjrS7Hgeaa	Preheat the oven.|`|AA11308339	I would bring it inside and make sure it has fresh feed, dry litter, and fresh water. it could be that it has a cold. Baby chicks are susceptible to colds and can die from them. They're supposed to have a rather warm environment of about 90 degrees Fahrenheit.|`|1MXVuXGaaa	I don't have any clue what is wrong with it or what to tell you to do.  All I can tell you is that when we have a chicken looking rough in the cold months, we get a box and bring it in the house for a day or two, and see how it goes.  Make sure it has clean food and water.  Other than that I'm not sure what to tell you.|`|hc8L01SJaa	Choke him.  Choking your chicken feels good and it will make him puke, then everybody feels better.|`|renZ4mvWaa	Not enough info for any of us to even be able to guess what's wrong and speculate as to what might happen.

Bring him in put him under a heat lamp if its cool in the area set up and take one of your waterers and use this solution. 1 tsp. electrolyte solution  2TBSP of sugar and mix it well then leave this in her pen and watch her make sure she eats and drinks it will gain her energy. Then call this hatchery and they will help you figure out whats wrong with your bird. I live way up north and for the amount of vets here you would be surprised at how little they know about chickens or wont even treat them. That really sucks. I have had better luck contacting the hatcheries. Heres the number for you to call They are open Monday thru Saturday.......1-800-456-3280 and heres theyre website that tells about some of their antibiotics and what they cure.

You didn't provide enough information for me to help you much. You should separate it away from the other chickens, many of the bacterial infections or diseases young chickens can get are transmittable to the others.
gzgmSevhaa	It's hard to answer this with just "floppy valve" to go on.  It could be laryngeal paralysis where a muscle isn't functioning correctly so every time you breath, cartilage that is normally pulled out of the way is sucked into the airway instead and blocks the air.  There is surgery to correct this that works pretty well.  With your vet saying it will progressively get worse, I'm more inclined to think it's laryngeal collapse.  It's sometimes congenitally inherited but can also be caused by trauma.  What happens is trauma occurs to the different cartilages that form this "valve" and they begin to fail, one after another over time, until the entire larynx (valve) collapses and closes the trachea (windpipe) entirely so the dog can't breath.  There is a surgery called a permanent tracheostomy to correct the condition, but there are usually a lot of complications and it requires some lifestyle changes, but the dogs can live happily for quite a while with this.  After your vet is able to do x-rays and look at the larynx under anesthesia they will be able to tell you the correct problem.  With either of these conditions, one of the problems you have is called aspiration pneumonia.  The dog can't control what enters it's windpipe so when ever it eats or drinks, some can go down into the lungs and starts up an infection there.  You can also have some objects trapped at the valve that would allow bacteria to start growing and cause infection.  The antibiotics would have cleared up this infection, but it's caused by the problem with the valve not working properly.    If it's due to the valve, it's not an allergy problem.  Elongated soft palate is most commonly seen in the smushed face dogs, but does occur with others.  It's not likely to be the culprit in this case because you can pretty much look into the mouth and see that the palate is too long.  It actually extends into the airway and blocks the air.  There is surgery to correct this and it's one that usually has  good outcome.  Aspiration pneumonia is another problem with this condition thought.  Anything that causes blockages or interference with how the airway works is likely to cause infection.|`|AA10376032	I have a 12 year old JRT who began having an allergy problems about 2 years ago... yes grey snot and weird snorting noises. She was put on allergy meds, and they helped.  Now, about 2 months ago she started making totally different breathing noises, mostly at night, actually about 4-5 am.  The vet said she has an elongated palate and it gets her breathing out of rhythm. We are supposed to distract her... give her a treat right away or play with her, to help her get out of the rhythm.  Anyway, it may possibly be one of those two things, or maybe both.  I have no idea why antibiotics may have helped except I see with my dog that both seem to come and go for short periods... so maybe coincidence.
fh2xwjvuaa	I'm not familiar with anything that causes a burning smell??? Maybe your dog actually burned herself? Check the leg over carefully for any signs of hair that's been singed, but I would go to the 24 hour vet either way.|`|AA11154535	the best thing for the dog to feel a little better is to put a cold cloth on its back to help the fever .. and brush it over its face .. and on its tummy... when my dog had a fever and she wouldnt move very much.. i did this and it seemed to make her alot happier... and as for the burning thing.. you should def get her to the vet!!

9bA1JD0vaa	Try an enzyme cleaner from the pet store to eliminate the odor and then steam clean.|`|AA11381711	I thought vinegar was only to aid in getting rid of the smell.  First you need to clean the urine with a carpet or upholstery cleaner to get most of the urine out if possible.  Then vinegar and water can help get rid of the smell only.  Try natures miracle to also help get rid of the smell.
jZp6jY9Zaa	Do not spill her food on the floor so that she will eat it.  At her meal times, put down her food.  Give her a maximum of 15 minutes to eat.  If she walks away from the bowl, pick it up and save the rest of the food for her next meal.  She will not starve if she doesn't finish her meal.  Do this at every meal and she will learn (probably within the first few days) that she has to eat when food is offered in the bowl otherwise she won't be getting any for the rest of the night.  It isn't mean, it won't make her starve or become malnourished.    Good luck!|`|AA11196163	I have heard that if you give them some tuna fish it spikes their appetite.  Also if you only give them food at certain times a day, that's when they will learn to eat.  Put the food away during time that you don't want her to eat.|`|nhnAlY3saa	i think that you should just leave the food in the bowl until she eats it... if she gets hungry enough she'll eat no matter where the food is. something like this happened to my dog when she was a puppy, only she wouldn't eat food unless it was in someone's hand... we just left it in the bowl, and she didn't eat for like a day and a half but then i guess she got hungry enough that she didn't care where the food was... so maybe you should try that...|`|6pAreldTaa	Your vet knows that by you feeding your dog this low grade food they will have a long history with you as far as disease and ailments.....4lbs a wk is a bit much....even for a large breed....She will not starve just like a child if we hold firm to our grounds they will eat when they are hungry....|`|ac2a44c193195e6b1581b89e4df72a82aa	first of all i assume that youre vet has ruled out any health issues (if you havent then talk to your vet first)okay youre feeding the dog real meat ,thats your problem the dog is holding out,jeez id be holding out too.stop feeding the dog human food .if the dog doesnt eat the dry food right away.then pick it up.the dog is going to get the idea that it cant eat when it feels like it which is good ..remember you are the alpha dog of the family.you are to decide when the puppy eats not the other way around.and if youre going with a good food the vet recommended ,you have no need of feeding it real meat its getting plenty of vitamins through the dog food.besides leaving dog food out is a bad idea anyways,it if youre feeding indoors it brings bugs (flys,roaches ect)..leaving dog food outdoors brings wildlife,(rats,mice,raccoons)also are you SURE no one in the family including yourself is sneaking it treats?a dog that fills up on treats (and the wrong kind of human food) is sure to end up overweight ,diabetes,joint problems....ect.
P7f346v8aa	Once, when the family went on vacation for a couple of weeks, we came home to discover that the fleas had taken up residence in the carpet next to a sunny window.  The carpet was alive!!!!!  So gross.    If it gets bad enough, you'll get flea bitten too.  It gives new meaning to "bed bugs".  Not fun.    Fleas can give your dog heartworms and tapeworms if the dog is not on a regular parasitic preventative medication.  Heartworms are lethal, tapeworms will make your dog very sickly.    1.  Treat the animals with a monthly flea preventative from your vet.  OTC's won't work nearly as well.   If the infestation is really bad, your vet can give the dog a pill that will kill all the fleas inhabiting the dog withing a couple of hours.  Then, you need to follow up with monthly preventative.  No way around this one.    2.  Treat the dogs environment.  Indoors and out.  Get "flea bombs" available at just about any grocery store in the pesticides department.  I use 1 bomb per room, or more if the room is large, close windows, turn off the central air, vacate the premisis (critters & humans.... and cover the aquarium with newspaper) and leave for several hours.  .... Consult your local home store about flea treatments for your yard.    Once the flea infestation is taken care of, all that should be maintained is the montly treatment for the animals.    Putting the dog outside won't rid the dog nor the house of fleas.  Once the dog is absent, the fleas will find the next best host available....you & your kids.   They won't live in your hair, rather the carpet, bedding, etc. ......but they'll bite (feed) on you.    Yuk.      Treat the critters (dogs & cats) & environment asap.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	The dog got them from outside.  You need to treat the yard & the dog & the house.  For every one you  see there are about 500 more you don't see.    Yes, they jump off the dog onto anything.  Carpet, couch, beds, closets.......all through out the house.    Horrible huh?    There are all kinds of products that will elimate them but it is a job.|`|AA11196163	Get some flea shampoo and bathe the poor dog.  Follow the directions on the shampoo.  Your family can get bites from the fleas and yes they will infest youur home!!  The dog probably got them from outside ...so that should be considered when putting the dog out.|`|3UlGbeDBaa	Fleas will spread, yes.      Can you call a local vet and purchase a professional powder from them?  The vet stuff is faster acting and more thorough than the stuff in the grocery store.  This helps you solve your problem faster.    The sooner, the better:).  And don't fret yourself too much as fleas are so common but easily treated:)    Depends where outside as fleas can live in grass (I'm not sure where the dog contracted them from).  But if you have a kennel or a spare room to isolate as you treat both the dog and the house separately that would be great.|`|XmMnoNilaa	treat the dog,and bomb the house.|`|HgCApRIhaa	Get Advantage and use it immediately. It will kill fleas on your little guy and when new eggs hatch and jump on him, it will kill those as well, it is a monthly treatment, but keep using it month to month or your pooch will get fleas again.  No need to flea bomb the house - unless you have an infestation - and you will definitely know if that occurs (wear white ankle socks and they will be covered with fleas).  Flea collars in my experience stink and they are not as effective as Advantage for eliminating fleas from your home.|`|DuDHbTiZaa	no u should get tweezers and pick the flea off or it willsuck ur blood intil its all gone

The pup now can go into a back yard type sitiuation where no other dogs that have not been vaccinated has had access to.The reason not to allow them outside is due to dieses they can pick up from where other animals have been. Like parvo, kennel cough, worms  etc...Our pups 10 weeks old now have been playing in the back yard since they were 5 weeks old. A nice sunny day a romp on the grass is good for them.

HvIS1Mk1aa	Yep.    Sad to say they do. And no matter what you try to feed them they just won't pack it in. I've certainly never yet been able to bribe them in to leaving things alone and I'll chuck just about anything in for fish to eat to see if it works or not. Though I will say they tend to do it less as they get big bigger - in my own experience the juveniles are terrible for it! I've often wondered if this is because, as they get bigger and stronger, they get much better at taking bigger types of live food.    It's a real bummer because, in adult colours they have got to be one of the best looking fish out there.    That said, I've heard other (reliable) people say they never touched the inverts.    I found this on Youtube. I know it probably isn't what you want to see but watch what the little rat does about 40 seconds in to the clip. They really can keep that up all day long - I've seen them at it. (You might want to mute it - there is some insanely irritating clicking going on in the background):    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLk49EPBj...    Now compare that to the surroundings in which an adult is kept in:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvkxxstpE...    Judging by the way the fish are boldly moving around the tank must be well established. And yet look what is flourishing in the same tank.    Your tank sounds like a seriously sexy piece of kit, BTW    I do so like big ol' tanks :o)|`|h8OqX12Haa	most "large" angels will attack corals and other inverts if you want a cool fish  then chose a tang yellow tang,blue tang and clown tang thse are my favorite tangs ( clows are hard to keep)   or choose a dwarf angel coral beauty angle is a good fish to start with  and mayna a foxface lo|`|P5BoZ6Pmaa	YES and Emperor angel will eat your live corals, this is part of their natural diet, along with small invertabrates, shrimp, crabs, worms, snails etc...  Basically for a reef type tank and Emperor is sadly off the list.  But it does give you a great excuse to get another fish only tank so you can enjoy this fish.|`|e420fc3a17c45bc842993ac5e2c88241aa	They are not reef safe.  This is not something you want to take a chance with b/c once the fish is in there, of course it would be hard to get out.  Every fish, even from the same genus, will act differently, no one can say for sure whether the fish will attack your corals or not, but since they are not reef safe there is a good chance it will.   It will nip at stony and soft corals (sessile invertebrates) and clam mantles, but may be kept with small-polyped stony corals and somewhat noxious soft corals.|`|GDGoQlZ9aa	Emperor Angelfish will eat or pick on the corals, Angelfishes and Butterflyfishes are related and both are not reef safe. They will eat live rocks and corals along with invertebrates inside of the tank. You can visit www.saltwaterfish.com to see the varieties of angelfishes that may be reef compatible.    However, Some people do chance it anyways, and some succeed at keeping them in a reef tank, and some doesn't. It depends on the temperament and it depends on how well fed you keep these fish.    I have a reef tank, and I got my butterflyfishes to eat the flakes instead of the corals, plus I have a Koran angelfish too, he does pick at the rocks. It's a chance that you are going to have to take if you want it bad.    The rocks will not disappear though, the only things that will disappear will be the organisms and the micro-organisms living on the rocks.     If you can get to train the Angelfish to eat flakes, I wouldn't suggest putting them in a reef tank.    Thanks for asking and good luck............

Then move the other pups away from mom and help her attach to a nipple without competition.  Try different nipples if necessary, as sometimes pups can have problems sucking....try a back nipple first, if she doesn't suck well, you may need to try a nipple that is towards the middle of mom.  If mom pushes her away (more than once) you will need to bottlefeed this pup, and keeping her warm is critical.|`|AA11287657	PLEASE CALL A VET NOW !!!|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	You need to get mom and puppies in to the vet right away.

There are several products I have used before - all have been excellent:-  Sentinel  Advocate  Revolution  Advantix  Frontline  These products are great because they also cover heartworm, other worms and some cover ticks.  If you can't affiordt to buy the mulitpacks go to your vet who will sell you a one month pack for average of $18.00  Just make sure you get one each month.  Meanwhile you need to do a super-thorough vacuum of your house now! Vacuuming is a great stopgap - while fleabomb is working you vacuum up the survivors.  You need to make sure your dog stays out of dirt where fleas breed.  Wash or throw out its bedding and start afresh.  Wash any of your clothes that are affected - soak them first to drown fleas and ideally add eucalyptus or ti-tri oil to wash water.  If your skin is itching from fleabites shower and then rub diluted lavendar oil on your skin to relieve itch.  Bath your dog thoroughly in a good-quality dog shampoo designed to also kill fleas and dry him throughly before applying any of the above products.|`|lvwY0ZYcaa	You need to treat your animal(s) go to vets or order online from www.1800petmeds.com and you also need to go to a home depot or lowes and get the spray to kill fleas or you can steam clean your carpets.|`|l2ma3RYraa	You need to get frontline plus from your veterinarian for your pets and use it according to the directions.

wpgbN3K6aa	Law enforcement agencies are too underfunded and overworked to be able to locate and shut down all of the puppy mills.  The best way to keep this from happening is to educate the public about where all of those cute litte "pet store puppies" are coming from.  Puppy mills (and other "pet mills" such as breeding facilities for rats, rabbits, mice, hamsters, birds, reptiles, and any other profitable pet) often sell the animals to pet stores, sell them through newpaper or internet articles, or sell them on the side of the road.  If the public would stop supporting these people by buying their animals, then they would be forced out of business.  How do you know that you are not buying from a "pet mill"?    1.  Never purchase an animal from a pet store!!!  Even those that claim they get their animals from "local breeders" or elsewhere, may still get them from mills or from uneducated "backyard breeders" that shouldn't be breeding animals either.    2.  If at all possible, try rescuing or adopting an animal from a rescue organization or shelter.  3.  When purchasing from a private breeder, ask a lot of questions about the breed to be sure the breeder knows what they are talking about.  Confirm their answers with your veterinarian.  4.  When purchasing from a breeder, always be sure the animals (parents also) have been tested for medical conditions common for the breed.  5.  When purchasing from a breeder, ALWAYS request to see the facilities, the parents, and the other littermates to evaluate the conditions they are being raised in.  The environment should be spacious, clean, odor free, and suitable for that type of animal to be living in.  (ex: puppies should not be on hard concrete floors, and rabbits should not be in wire cages without bottoms).    6.  NEVER have an animal shipped to you.  If a breeder is willing to do this, it probably means they are not a very responsible breeder in the first place.    |`|Bw18seFqaa	Millers just dont care..  they see these animals as livestock, money makers.    They laugh about people who keep them as "pets"..yes, they mock the people that they are supplying these puppies for!  They dont see these animals as loving companions.      The only thing you can do to prevent it is to continue to educate people about puppy mills, and encourage them to adopt or to find a reputable breeder..  remind people that petshop puppies come from places like this.    Did you get pics of some of the dogs?  The matts, open sores, the poor crop and dock jobs.. etc..  these could be used on a website to help spread the word..  pictures sometimes say more to people than a few words do!|`|DhE0rEWiaa	Yes I know what you mean, the only way to stop this is to educate people about where those puppy's come from in pet stores and the condition that they are born into, the only way puppy mills will be put out of business if people stop getting there dogs from pet stores, because every time a person gets a puppy from a pet store that put another dollar in the puppy mills pockets.     The puppy mills only care about one thing, that's how much money they are going to take in, they don't care about the dogs it's all money to them.     Education is what we need to get out to people, that they are not saving a puppy form the horrible conditions of being in a pet shop they are supporting puppy mills plain and simple.|`|StsTnMoPaa	Some people just don't know, but for the most part people are just terrible. In my home town (Parkersburg, WV) there was recently a puppy mill raid and the humane society rescued 1000 (yes, a THOUSAND) dachunds, and other small dogs from a kennel. One of them had a broken pelvis.    I feel the best way to prevent this, is to educate people that puppy mills are out there, and to keep adopting from shelters.|`|AA11525891	Welcome to the world of rescue. We see this all the time.

The people who can do this to innocent animals, that at any point are willing and eager to provide unconditional love to their humans, shows the innocence of a child.     Anyone who can be so empty and cruel is seriously a dangerous individual with sociopathic mental illness. There is no excuse for this and these people deserve to be imprisoned with the rapists, child molesters, and other low life degenerates. They are disgusting.    On behalf of every decent human heart who reads this, thanks for doing your part in the rescue. I pray they all find good homes, and they can forget all the terror of their lives in the puppy mill.|`|AA11311704	That is horrible, just horrible!! But someone said these mill 'people treat them like livestock'.  Please don't group people together like that... I actually own a beef cattle farm and although we use our animals for meat they are treated very well... vet visits, vaccines, literally tons of feed, piped in fresh water, ect. ect. ect. I know that they are different dogs and cattle but as much as I adore my pups I do really care for our cattle... they help my family and my brothers family survive.  Aren't animals so amazing... Hopefully these dogs will find great homes and forget those awful people!!!    You should be VERY proud to have helped them...

I named him Hiro like Hiro Nakamura in the series Heroes. They are very good guard dogs. They bark really loud! They don't have a tail and their color are black, white, and brown. The tail is generally docked if it is longer then 4 inches, though most are naturally short. The coat is of medium texture, straight to slightly wavy, weather resistant, of moderate length with an undercoat. Their not small but they are medium-sized. Australian Shepherds are easy going, perpetual puppies that love to play. Courageous, loyal and affectionate, they are excellent children's companions that are great with active children. Height: Dogs 20-23 inches (52-58cm.) Bitches 18-21 inches (46-53cm.)  Weight: Dogs 50-65 pounds (25-29 kg) Bitches 40-55 pounds (18-25 kg.) My dog is a bit shy but when he meets his dog friends over and over again, he becomes playful! Australian Shepherds are from the herding group. They are really, really fast runners! They are one of the smartest dogs and they learn tricks easily. This energetic working dog needs plenty of vigorous exercise to stay in shape, mentally and physically, or better yet, some real work to do. Very intelligent and crave a good challenge. They need to be taken on a daily, brisk, long walk, jog or run alongside you when you bicycle. If under-exercised, this breed can become restless and destructive. Thanks for asking this question.

RNRmgkg2aa	Hi! Well, the spraying is certainly a problem and a stinky one too!     The cats are trying to show who's boss and marking their territory, etc...    The best solution to this problem that I could recommend would be to get ALL kitties in the household either spayed or neutered, provide one on one time with both, and make sure they each have their own litter boxes... One per cat... I have 4 adult cats and two kittens... all the big cats are fixed and the 2 kittens are next...  Believe it or not, I have zero cat "issues" at this point and they all get along well....    If they're tearing eachother up and spraying and stuff they definitely need to be fixed... Mine might hiss at eachother once in a while but they would never full-out fight with claws and stuff...     Well, good luck and I hope you find a solution to your problem, I know it's stressful when they're constantly battling and spraying... see about getting them fixed though, I think that will fix the problem but you have to do it soon before they get in the habit too deeply of spraying...    :o)|`|AA12225723	Its spraying its scent from a scent gland and it is marking its territory to try to keep other cats away.|`|AA11287657	Your cat is marking his territory with his spray.  It sounds like his instincts are in overdrive because he is attacking a female cat. But if it is not his mating season this may be understandable as many cats do not like other cats anywhere near their territory.  He sounds like he wants to be the only cat in your household.  It also sounds like he is not desexed. Normally after desexing they stop sraying (I have a male cat who is desexed) and lose a lot of aggressive tendancies.  It's quite possible in mating season your male cat will be mating with rather than attacking your female cat.  But because he is damaging her it is advisable to have him desexed to see whether his behaviour improves.  If it dosen't then you may need to make a decision as to which cat you will keep.  Do ask your vet for further advice.  Also until you do take action try to keep the cats seperated to prevent any further damage to the female.|`|35QtJdIzaa	Is he neutered and has anything changed in the house recently?

Try and see if it helps.|`|6Laxjz2naa	if you dont want youre hamster to smell for atleast  a week you have to get rat shampoo and bathe it with warm water and brush it to or you can simply get rat dust bathe. they roll around in it and they will be smellin like fowers all day .|`|KToEYmwWaa	I can't help you with the smell, but I just want to let you know (for future rats) that if you have the girls spayed, their chance of getting tumors is drastically reduced, which in turn makes their lives longer and happier.  It is a bit expensive, but still cheaper than removing multiple tumors.  Good luch, hope you figure out where the smell is coming from : )|`|5qIOzchwaa	I bathe my rats with organic baby shampoo that's tearless. I also actually wash their cage every 2 weeks. (you can use lots of things on it last time I soaked it in a betadine solution to hopefully kill bacteria) I wouldn't call you neglectful for having rats with tumors, but I would call you neglectful if you just let them suffer and never take them to the vet to see what can be done for them... It's their cycle. They wanna smell "hot" for some boys LOL.|`|AA11124885	Ours are smelly every 4-5 days, I think it is their 'cycle'.

I would advise this to anyone as there are alot of unwanted cats out there.|`|10zSZntVaa	If she's pushing then they are probably stuck.  I had a cat that had a second liter the next day.

ltIuUBXNaa	Don't waste your time with the fruits and veggies they won't eat them. What they do eat however, besides the bugs you are feeding are lizards. That is what they eat in the wild. I wouldn't suggest it in captivity. Instead of just wax and meal worms, add goliath, super, butter, phoenix, silk worms to the mix for more variety. Yes it's best if you dust the crickets and/or worms with a vitamin and calcium powder before feeding them.|`|xoXkHOVsaa	Most collared lizards will not eat veggies, so you don't need them.  Dust the crickets and worms with calcium powder.    Here is a care sheet:  http://www.wildlifepetcare.com/collared_...
uBFhKXgHaa	Absolutely. Purina is a low quality cat food.    Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your cat? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.    Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.    Thankfully, there are some excellent cat foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.    Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!    Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul and Felidae.    Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by the crappy pet food companies! They also often get paid to sell some of their products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)    A great option is to go with an entirely grainless diet. Diets high in grain/carbohydrates have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Cats are obligate carnivores, so why should there be grain in their diet? Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.    Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo.     If you can't find a food, most of the high quality cat food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the cat food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.    Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/    Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food    Another option for feeding cats is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:  http://www.rawfedcats.org/ (Excellent raw feeding information for cats)  http://www.rawfed.com/ (More excellent raw feeding information)  http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html (Myths about raw feeding)    Now the question is, do you feed wet or dry? Wet is the correct answer. The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:  http://www.catinfo.org/  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)  http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne... (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)  http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac... (Why Cats Need Canned Food)  http|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	I would switch her to wellness|`|q9yCfq4eaa	what ever you do don't ever switch to royal canin they put euthanized animals in the food for the meaty flavor|`|487pYnzraa	Maybe u buying some fresh fish to cook for her to provide her more variety and pamper her with other can food occasionally?

Mzvp1LPFaa	Can't see the picture, but unless it's extreme it shouldn't be a problem for a pet dog.   In many breeds the standard calls for an undershot bite - bulldogs, boxers, etc.  BTW, it's fairly common for ranched foxes to be undershot but it doesn't interfere with them being able to eat their kibbled food.|`|00f9873d58a871ae31ecf33313f803caaa	What breed is your dog?  I have shih tzus and underbites are perfectly normal for that breed.  Do check with the vet and see if the underbite is normal for your dog.|`|DdHhNpR3aa	My dog has an under bite and the upper canines rubbed the insides of the lower canines creating holes that went below the gum line. I paid a lot of money to have the holes filled and he still had to have one pulled. I take him to get a "dental" done at the vet every year and they do a professional cleaning that requires him being sedated. If I hadn't had him checked yearly it may have been worse and he could've gotten a terriable infection in his mouth. Just keep getting your dogs mouth looked at when he goes in for his annual shots and follow the vets advise.|`|vPde97E2aa	OK,that's under-shot-=lower teeth in front of upper or OVER-shot=lower behind upper(dog terms) & NO,it ONLY means it must NEVER reproduce!|`|qioH81tiaa	Depends on how sever it is, and what breed.  Did you not notice this when you got the dog?  Have you mentioned your concerns to the vet?    Most underbites aren't sever enough to cause issues, and some breeds are supposed to have an under shot jaw.    Add: it must never reproduce?  Most likely in this case, but what about those breeds where an under shot jaw is in the STANDARD??????????
ZIq2IzOmaa	If your dog can behave on his own and doesn't chew or do other things, then he doesn't have to be crated trained.     However crate training gives your dog his own safe little place to go and sit if he is tired, sick, frightened or otherwise upset. A crate becomes a den for your dog and he can go there to calm down or to relax. Having a crate can also make it easier for your pet to travel if need be.     Crate training is very easy, and if you can afford a crate it is a useful option when you need it.     My dogs have both been crate trained and they use their crates as a den. It also makes seperateing them much much easier when we need to take just one dog to the vet. One dog is given a treat in her crate and the door is shut before we leash the other dog. Yes there is whining, but there is no 60 pound labrador running around upset that she's not going. Both of our dogs are mature and well behaved, so they are allowed to run the house while we are gone. When they were younger and might still get the impulse to misbehave, they spent the day in crates to prevent trouble.|`|DuNMpJleaa	He doesn't necessarily need to be crate trained if he doesn't tear the house apart. It just depends I personally think you should crate train him for the first month or so and then start letting him out at night and then when your away. It's best to do it that way just in case you have to take him to a doggie hotel (Never send a Pit Bull to a Kennel where it will just sit in a cage find a place where they actually can play and be out of the crate the whole day) if you go away because its always better to crate train a dog when it's younger. Hope this helps.    Debz

I don't know why but mine does it right before she jumps up... opposite of yoru cat!!!!! but if your cat does that when she is sitting then prob she saw birds or something.. or something moving. trying to get whatever she saw.|`|qBDL8iFxaa	Nothing really. Just a noise. She is normal and fine
K6Wprvzaaa	Take it slow, never force him or pull him over. I would suggest to bring a bunch of treats he really loves, and reward any progress he's making, even if it's one step at a time. He may not make it over the bridge on your first try, so be patient, or his phobia will get worse.  Just show him that there's nothing to be afraid of, and associate something positive with the bridge (ie the treats)|`|SbLeCOjZaa	Offer lots of treats as incentive! It is probably the sound of the water that scares him.|`|9UttDvcsaa	I would just sit down with her and let her take it in for a little while.  She will probably get curious and want to cross or bored and want to go home.  Just don't rush her or force her or you will always have in issue.  Also if you fiancee could carry her a couple of times and put her down 3/4 of the way across and then 1/2 way across the next time it might be easier on her.  That water looks pretty loud and strong to me!  No wonder she is scared, it is beautiful though! :-)  Good Luck!|`|RxF4XFhQaa	go near the water first and get him familiar with it then cross it so he doesnt get so scared or cover his eyes before you get on the bridge and just repeat him name a lot while your walking over it|`|joBYl8vHaa	Direct his attention to something else. When you get close to the bridge, offer him a treat. Then as your passing over the bridge, have a treat in your hand and let your dog chew at it. Don't give it to him until you get to the other side. That way he will be focused on trying to get the treat out of your hand. Give your dog lots and lots of praise every time he does it. It will probably take a few tries but keep at it. Good luck!|`|7d9Njtitaa	have your fiance stand with him on one side and you go to the other and call him over to you with teats or a ball or toy hope you can get him to go through
AA11709234	No.  They whelp when they are ready.  You really have a clue that your dog is getting very close to whelping, and if you are a good breeder, you do NOT SLEEP.  I have 10 day old puppies and have barely gotten 4 straight hours since they were born!!!!  There are clear signs that whelping is SOON.|`|SiBw4x0caa	Dogs can't tell time.  Simple coincidence.  |`|iIGOi2Idaa	No they do not have a set time to start whelping, I think it's a coincidence that both your friend's dogs started at this time.    No the dogs wouldn't wake their owners up. Depends on the relationship dogs have with their owners I suppose, but mostly they like to do it alone. Your supposed to leave dogs alone as much as possible while they're whelping.    Chalice|`|ThkwVHamaa	I done alot of research when my dog was preggers and i found out that the female will whelp when the house is quiet and has started to wind down for the nght and more than likley whelp when no one is around but then you know cause of the whines lol|`|AA11525891	We just had a litter of 5 Pyrenees. This was the females 2nd litter. The 1st one puppy of the 1st litter was born @ 10:52 PM and the 1st one of the 2nd litter was born @ 5:05 pm. I have had them come at all hours of the day and night.    As for waking you, the male should never be anywhere near a female about to give birth. It can lead to conflict and stress. As for the female, she will probably have been keeping you awake for a day or so already so odds are you will not be asleep. However, my mothers 1st female starting whelping on her own and even though we were checking here regularly, the first 1 was a surprise!
HypqcnJaaa	Coco Belle     I like Maiden :)|`|llEdx8Q2aa	OMG! I am so jealous I really want a poodle ( I know not the same as a kitty but still a pet).

LOL I know that didn't help bit it's a cool name.|`|DS2huIAkaa	Wait till you have the kitty first. Sometimes their appearance or behavior will suggest a name to you, one that will sound it "suites" him/her.  I have six cats and they all have single (not double) names all "suggested" to me by the way they looked or acted when kittens. (mother+5 babies, all boys).    I found mother abandoned, ill and dirty with black engine oil from being under a car, weak, dehydrated and pregnant . Her hair had to be cut down to the skin. She looked so ugly, especially so because she is persian, she reminded me of E.T. in the film so, I called her "Eety". Her first born is a mischievous teddy-boy so, I called him "Teddy", the others: "Bully" because he is big (but gentle), "Tito" because he tip-toes and sneaks everywhere without being noticed, "Mark" because his coat is one colour without any markings at all and "Polo" because he is pure white (polar bear, polo mint) and because he is very attached to Mark, always together so, they make "Marco Polo".
5IcNNkkuaa	Why would your 'friend' give away your cat? Legally, they are not able to do this. Call the authorities, if you are really upset about it, they should be able to get you your cat back.|`|wffHLYieaa	Why would you consider them a friend?  Were you sharing an apartment?  I would ask he or she to get it back!|`|Hs19BCy9aa	go get your cat back and then give away your friends pet|`|ca8edf2a66d3abd8c642d9f347f4b0b0aa	It would depend on the circumstances. If I was sharing an apartment with this friend and left for work one day and came back and found my friend did that. I'd make him/her go get my cat back. If that didn't work I would call the police and press charges. Then move out.    Now if I went away and didn't tell my friend when I'd be back. I got back more then a month later. Then you should expect that, especially if he/she doesn't like or is allergic to cats. And if I was the friend I'd be pretty mad at you for not keeping me in the loop.|`|bxlYleZkaa	I don't have any friends who would do that.|`|VMY7No0eaa	find who they gave it to and go get it... they don't have the option to give away your things.|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	The cat is not theirs to give away. This is theft. I'd call the cops and report it.|`|AA10603470	NOT a Friend .   I'd Go GET The Cat BACK|`|r1hnI0Tzaa	OMG what in the WORLD!!!!!

Yell at hem and never talk to them again plus get your cat back and calmly explain to the person he/he gave the cat to that that is your cat!=(|`|isPCwnNzaa	Well. It depends on if it was an accident or they did it intentionally. If it was an accident forgive them and go get it back. If it wasn't get the cat and have it bite his/her head off.|`|qBDL8iFxaa	Yell at them. Unless there SINCERELY sorry. THen be slightly mad but don't be too mean.|`|OoKDLzO4aa	Punch her in the face.

VMxqr5iWaa	try visiting this website for your answers.. there awesome people there and will help A LOT!    http://repticzone.com/|`|CVXCSTHoaa	It is usually a month or so after mating before pregnancy becomes obvious. A lumpiness can be felt in the ventral aspect of the female's mid-body. This is best felt when her muscles are relaxed by letting her gently run through the hands. As the pregnancy progresses the swelling becomes more pronounced and moves caudally (tailwards!). She often stops feeding in the second half of her pregnancy, after initially eating voraciously.    Birth occurs typically 90 to 100 days after mating. The female should be alone, in an escape-proof (for babies!) cage, and there should be plenty of cover for the babies to prevent accidental injury from the mother. Some breeders advocate a 'nesting box' with damp sphagnum moss inside - this may stimulate the mother into giving birth, and also assists the young with their first slough. The young are immediately independent and many start to feed within a day or two|`|GO0xNm0Waa	Almost immediately after coming out of brumation (dormancy in reptiles that is similar to hibernation that lasts for 4 months), female garter snakes start ovulating and mating. They give birth approximately two to tree months after conception. A single litter can produce anywhere from 3 to 50 snakes.  Hope that helps.
AA11310065	The lazy eye likely won't affect your puppy's ability to function. If money is no object there maybe some type of surgery that is available but I don't believe it is common. I also have heard that a lazy eye is indicative of weaker muscles in the eye. You may want to run it by a vet, but if your were to put a patch over the stronger eye it would help strengthen the weaker eye as the puppy would rely on it. Perhaps a few hours a day.     This may be a good time to start since Holloween is around the corner...no one would make fun of your cute little Pirate Arrgghhh!    |`|6hFYbuN8aa	TAKE IT TO THE VET|`|5e9lMntkaa	stuck for life|`|QCkRRqVwaa	Most likely permanent, although it may be worms. If you haven't already wormed it, go ahead and do it. It needs to be done even if it doesn't fix the eye.   Consult with the vet, and he could get to the problem in no time.  |`|9vljnRWxaa	Take it to the vet. They should be able to help you out. Dont just leave it like that though. It should get some help with it. Its the best for the dog. Hope this helps!!!|`|ydshiNrKaa	What does your vet say about the eye?  Surely you asked about it when you took her in.  As him for some suggestions, or what can be done to help fix it.  he's the one who would know how to help the pup.
ZJ2tem3baa	It is VERY common for little kittens to have round worms or any other parasite.  I would take her to the vet and have them give her a general dewormer which will kill all types of parasites that might be in there.  Do not use the over the counter stuff, it does not work b/c it is not strong enough and it only treats one type of parasite.  Her stools should be nice and firm, not loose.  I currently have a kitten and he usually poops 2 times a day, 3 at the most.  A round bloated, firm belly is usually a good sign of a parasite infection.  Until you can get the kitten to the vet, wash your hands thoroughly and keep the kitten away from the adult cat, parasites are very contagious.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	She may have worms and she can give them to your cat if they're using the same litter box. I'd take her to your vet and have them do a fecal. Its better than your cat getting worms too.|`|283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	She is a baby and babies poo a lot. It doesn't matter if they are human babies or animal babies. Babies poo a lot. They have such small systems and require a lot of food for energy and to grow..much more than grown cats (proportionately) since grown cats nap a lot and are not as active as kits and they don't have anymore growing to do.    Since the kit has a bloated tummy then have the kitten checked by a vet and dewormed, most kittens have worms. Continue with the good kitten food (canned or canned and dry mixed). It is more the consistency, color, and smell, that matters rather than amount.    If the kit has not been spayed yet then the vet exam and deworming appointment would be a great time to set up an appointment for her spay.
EKg97zZlaa	i think you should take it out,who knows what that stuff is and where it's from.Bring it back if you can you don't want to waste your money on something useless.And you don't want to risk your precious pufferfish.by the way that is a very cool fish you have!!!|`|kwYxQp0Maa	I would take it out, no telling what it is but could spread and cause problems.
6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	Try to get it down to 100 - 105 degrees. Yours is just a little too high and forget information from pet stores. So far from my experience they have been pretty much wrong on the care of most reptiles.|`|2CbfO4jWaa	ive always used 130F min. basking temps. for any basking lizard. monitors, tegus, bearded dragons, uro's, collard lizards you name it. you have to remember we are talking about the surface temp. of a spot in the cage not the air temps. its like going to the beach on a 90F day. the sand and rocks are like 130F-165F. thats the surface temp. range you beardie wants to put its belly on to bask. now i know people are going to say "my beardies do great and breed with 105F basking spots" just look at these other answers. but i say that has more to do with how hardy beardies are in substandard environments, than to do with the quality of that care approach. facts are beardies will use basking temps up to 165F so temps that high must be use full to them (the second pic proves that http://forums.kingsnake.com/view.php?id=... ) stop reading care sheets and try different things your self. this isnt baking a cake with a recipie. its and art.|`|kBek6QCLaa	yeah, it should be 100-105    110 being the highest|`|f8t4FQZ5aa	Basking temps should fall within 95-105F and up to 110F for hatchlings and young juveniles as suggested.

Expressive face, nice ears, masculine head, a bit too lanky for my liking, but a nice saddle. Not sure who in the world wouldn't want that dog anymore. He doesn't look old, but it's tough to tell by looking at pictures. I'll just give you a 1 1/2 to 4 years old estimate. Best way of checking is by looking at his teeth.

veDvtYhJaa	Your brother is rude and crude and dumb.      You didn't say where he sprayed the cologne.  If he sprayed it into the dog's mouth, that could make the puppy sick.  If he sprayed the dog in the eyes, he could harm the dog's vision.  If he did either of those two things, you must tell your parents as they are harmful.  If he just sprayed the fur, then he's just dumb as a rock, and the dog will be fine. -!-|`|afPzgCSHaa	Its not healthy for your dog.

iNAakISQaa	Your canary may have feather mites.They live in and feed on the feathers of your canary and other pet bird. Although it is not life threatening it is irritating so you should bring it to the vet or buy a special product to destroy them.Here is a website about feather mites:  http://www.canaryadvisor.com/feather-mit...
AEAS7A9naa	Ruby,  I would take the cat to a vet. This way you can check it's even if it isn't yours and see how far along she really. The vet will be able to give you a better idea of what to do. Cats have between 3-5 kittens ( the breed may have something to do with it). the pregnant cat will be more loving and quiet. Her nipples will also be pinkish. the kittens probably are be about as big as 1/3 of your pointing finger since kittens are that big when they're born and cats are pregnant from 61-69 days. Look at this website. And if you keep the babies know that you can give the kitten s for adoption to a shelter or sell them yourself. again talk to a vet.  Hope this has helped,   Robin|`|rRfUtK8Kaa	"and howl alot"    Do cats howl?|`|VMY7No0eaa	If she is not far along they can spay her... this will help.

A vet might not be willing to perform an abortion on a cat, anyway.  You COULD wait until they're born and weaned and then try to place them, and get the mother spayed at that time.   Meanwhile, I recommend asking a vet for advice.|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	As you can see, you're going to get differing opinions on this issue.  The best thing for you to do is ........CALL THE VET AND ASK!!    Some vets will spay a cat that's in heat, or pregnant.......some will not!  See what your vet has to say.      If your "stray" cat got pregnant the last week of December, she'd be about 4-5 weeks pregnant by now........and the gestation period for kittens is NINE ( 9 ) weeks, or 63 +/- days.  So, the vet may not want to do it now.  But, it can't hurt to ASK.........    Take her in and let him have a look at her.  If he says she's too far along to abort safely, he'll be able to tell you how to care for her and them, until the kittens are ready for a new home ( about 9 weeks old ).    If you cannot take them into your house, you may have to surrender the mom and whatever she's carrying ( if she is ), so that they don't have to live outside.  Hopefully, you can find a home for THEM.    Good luck..............|`|bqbrKFeUaa	Hurry and e-mail the answerer known from the name kitcat she sounds like she really would take care of them and has agreed to do so.|`|7GUYMYmBaa	Not all shelters are kills shelters. In fact, we get pregnant cats quite often at the SPCA and we don't euthanize them, we try to save them.....and usually there is always a volunteer or employee that will foster them...and keep them together. If you don't mind, why not take care of them yourself for at least awhile.....and maybe after she gives birth when they are healthy and close to 2 mos then take them to the shelter. The age of 2 months is adoptable bcuz they will then spay/neuter them before they get adopted otherwise younger than 2 mos you do risk the chance of them getting euthanized or hopefully fostered til they are adoptable.........Good luck.|`|MtZkuN1yaa	I could NEVER think of doing such a cruel thing if i was you i would find someone how wants her and if you really want a cat keep one of the kittens and get it spayed or nuttered

Normally they would allow you to pay a pet fee, if pets are accepted. If they do not allow animals, then the kitty has to hit the pavement.|`|xi9amEG2aa	They should have told you when you moved in if you were allowed to have pets or not.  If they didn't say, you should have asked.  Most apartments don't allow pets, and along with many houses that are rented out.  The owner of the property that you are renting from doesn't want anybody's pets messing up the house.    Me and my boyfriend are currently renting a house, and have my dog with us.  We are paying an extra $25 bucks just for her.  That is because if she, say...destroys the house....nobody is allowed to have pets after we move out.  If she's good and doesn't make a mess of the house, people after us are allowed to have pets.      If he tells you to get rid of it, see if you can kind of negotiate to see if you can pay an extra $25 bucks or so a month to keep the cat.|`|a1ymHaWAaa	if you didn't pay deposit and required to do so|`|HbmHRiwLaa	No way!  The lease can not be changed or altered in mid contract unless both parties argree and sign.  They would not even be able to physically throw you out.  and you could sue them!|`|Bw18seFqaa	what does your lease say about pets?    If there was a no pet policy.. yes they can tell you that.    However if there was an agreement that you could have the cat, and its spelled out in the lease, no, they can not make you get rid of the cat, the apartment would be breaking the lease then.|`|rDLTnjRyaa	Here is how that works: you made an agreement when you signed your lease. If the cat destroys the apartment(like the carpet and curtains for example) and it is spraying all throughout the apartment, then the landlord has the right to tell you that the cat has to go. If you refuse to give it up, then you face eviction. If you were not allowed to have pets in the apartment and somebody found out that you violated the lease, you would have to make a choice to get rid of it and pay a fine, or simply decide it is time to move out.|`|9ImX52QQaa	Depends on your contract/lease. If they have "No cats" or "no animals", then it is more likely that they can. If the cat is a bit wild, or such, they can also do so.|`|cwsYM2F4aa	It depends.  When you began the lease, were you allowed to have it?  Did you put down a pet deposit?  Or did you sneak the cat in without their knowledge?    If you were allowed to have it and you put down a deposit and all that, I don't see how they could tell you to get rid of it.  I think you legally have a right to have it there, at least until the end of your lease.    If you snuck it in, they can tell you to get rid of it, as it wasn't part of your lease agreement to have pets.    I really hope you don't have to get rid of it.  Good luck.|`|gjMJzfoeaa	Deposit or not (some places don't charge a deposit) check your lease and compare it with your apartment complex's rules and regulations.     I lived in a complex that advertised they OK'd cats, but when I signed the lease there was a no pets clause. I signed a separate contract for my cat. When I asked about the conflict, they stated that the no pets clause in the lease was incase the complex was sold out. The lease would trump over the contract.|`|791d4f9e4f79c13e41e826352dcb9b61aa	Depends on your lease agreement. Or if you cat has done damage to the property

Nope|`|fP0C9s8daa	It is okay as long as it's gentle but it's not the best way to scowl puppies.  Every time he does have bad behavior, you should just ignore him .  This would make your dog realize that being bad would only get him ignored .  Or you can also put on a serious voice and say,"Bad dog ." or, "No."|`|RyApVLzQaa	If my puppy doesn't obey the rules i've taught him I simply give him a spanking on the butt once or twice real lightly and put him back down.  He usually listens after that and if he doesn't we put him in a kennel.  Whatever you do though do NOT flick him in then nose that can cause problems later on in their lives.  Not so sure about pushing and if that's actually teaching a dog that what he's doing is wrong...|`|ElBIeRFNaa	it's NEVER ok to push a poor defenseless puppy!  he's just a dog, he doesn't understand what he has or hasn't done.|`|443578ac145c721ca967e548ac55f900aa	No it's not the correct route.  It is only right if he is about to get hurt or if it's a life or death situation where you need to save him or keep him from getting hurt.  He is a baby, and a baby needs proper attention.  It's called patience.  I suggest a good training book (found anywhere....but, please don't purchase from a pet store that sells pound puppies), and sign your baby up for puppy training and/or obedience training.  These classes can be found many places, even at Pets Mart or PetCo.  These classes not only help to train your baby, but they will train you to properly teach your puppy without the physical side of pushing.  Get down on the floor, hold him, tell him NO, and treat him with the respect that you expect to get in return as he grows in age.      Thank you, and good luck to you both.|`|FrLDHBLfaa	If you push him, he'll think you're playing a game.  That will encourage the undesired behaviour, because he'll think that the behaviour is the way to tell you he wants to play.|`|yUnQahGoaa	I suppose if he's biting you or biting/eating something he shouldn't be a nudge wouldn't be so bad.

To him, you're just pushing him for no reason.  First train him....then when he 1. refuses to listen or 2. hasn't quite mastered the "command" yet THEN you can admonish him.  Don't push, hit, kick or yell at him though.  It will only make him scared of you.  Read up on training and proper techniques.  Consult a professional if you need to but don't get aggressive.|`|pJ7icz0taa	NO  he is a puppy and if you want him trained to behave then take him to puppy school...ask your VET about one...ask the groomer for school info.    Do not mistreat your dog..or he will get back at you when he is grown up.  Say NO in a stern voice, eventually he will get it.   As for jumping on people you need to put your knee up to stop him he will eventually get that also.  A loud NO is sufficent, it takes time..he is a puppy.  Just like babies...they eventually understand NO without being mean to a baby.|`|veDvtYhJaa	I think you need to go to obedience classes with the puppy.  YOU need to be trained how to treat a dog properly.  You don't push a puppy around that way; all it does is ruin his temperament as it doesn't teach him anything.  He has no idea what you are thinking, and your action of pushing him any time you don't approve of something doesn't tell him what you don't want him to do.  All it tells the puppy is that you don't love him.      He doesn't behave well because YOU don't behave properly towards him and possibly you have inappropriate expectations.  If you don't want to go  to obedience school, then get books on how to train your dog.  If you're not willing to learn by going to classes or reading, then give the dog to a local rescue group before you become abusive to him.     Bottom line... pushing or shoving a puppy as a discipline is NOT ok.  It's the same as if you were pushing or shoving a toddler around.  That's abusive and stupid. -!-|`|qU3pgoOfaa	Your dog does not respect you. The first thing you need to do is to get your dog into some basic dog obedience training. You can either try this at home, following online advice from a website, or you can enroll in a puppy training class. I would suggest trying it at home first and see how it goes. Start with the basics. Sit, Down, Stay. And see how your puppy changes towards you.

It is because it is her puppy , and she probably thinks of the cat as her puppy too . My dog has had puppies plenty of times  so this might be why .  In nature at some point they leave their puppies . When the mother is ready to leave her puppy on its own , she stops feeding it . She may have just started doing this because the puppy can eat on its own now and maybe having a puppy made her think the cat is hers too . I think moms also start being mean and ignoring their puppies too .|`|4785a161415a0c4adadd4b93faefef10aa	Just like humans, some dogs arn't very good moms. They should be weened around 2 months so they don't need to be with the mom anymore as long as they are eating mushy solid foods. I'd separate them if you think the puppies could get hurt. I've had moms kill pups. Use your best judgement. It won't hurt them to be separated from mom- if thats the case- just make sure they are fed and loved :).|`|d7bcedc128f094df6e910173d672703eaa	As a child, I had a puppy that someone gave to me because the mother was killing each puppy one by one.

H5vB645faa	It depends on what size dog he is.  Weight has a lot to do with the amount of bad things a dog can tolerate. Chances are he will be OK.  Watch him carefully, make sure that he is drinking, eating and going to the bathroom. If anything unusual happens call your vet and ask him or her.  If you suspect that any of the candy was made with Xylitol (a sugar substitute) this has been know to cause major problems and he should go to the vet ASAP. Here is a good reference.    http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles...    If it is only sugar candy, he may get diarrhea but should be fine.    Best thing to do is watch him carefully.  Good luck.|`|eJ4IR5Epaa	Wow, keep as very close eye on your dog. Watch for constipation, and vomiting. It depends if he is a small dog or big dog, the effects it will have on him. Not so much the candy. But chocolate can severely harm dogs and cats. Watch if he is eating his food or drinking water. If he is not himself take him to animal hospitol. Hopefully he will be okay. My dog got into easter candy a few years back, he ate an entire chocolate bunny, we were very concerned, but he turned out to be fine. So it all depends on your dog.   |`|yFYpxZeyaa	Just think how you would feel if you had gorged to that extent.  he will be fine after a bit of a dodgy stomach and probably leave you a few surprise presents round the place.

However if your dog is small and ate all this I would highly suggest getting it checked out by a vet. If it is a bigger dog it should most likely come out in its poop. However, I would strongly suggest at your next vet appointment tell them what happened, but for the most part you will find it in your dogs poop. |`|AA10361343	He will probably be okay, but may have some very bad diarrhea from all the candy, so watch out for that.|`|0lvnDXEtaa	idk about the wrappers but the candy shouldnt hurt him if he starts to throw up or have diahrea thats a good thing,that means he's getting it out of his system|`|94ef238f7854b4c3d9896acaeb2179a1aa	I don't think either will hurt him my dog ate wicker a few months ago and the vet said most things will pass.. watch for bleeding then call the vet|`|ywGcf4praa	please keep all sweets away from your dog.

E2oEVStcaa	You can't tell if a cat is overweight just from its weight without seeing the cat.    This is a test that you can tell for yourself:    It is hard to tell from the weight, the way we were taught when i worked at the vets was you look at the cat from above when it is standing ( so you are looking down at its spine).    You should see a slight hourglass shape in a healthy cat with no definition of ribbones.     An underweight cat has a definite hourglass shape with protruding ribs,  an overweight cat has no hourglass shape, you can not feel its ribs and from the side its belly drops lower than its ribs.    Good luck. xx    PS Overweight cats (and underweight cats) have a shortened lifespan, just like people so it is best to keep them in top condition, then they are happy, are more active and you have them for longer.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	5lbs sounds small for a full-grown cat.

If the blood doesn't stop by the morning, call the vet and have him checked out.|`|nDMop1hHaa	He could have eaten something and be poisoned now...maybe he is bringing the blood up from internal bleeding...|`|voJiq46Paa	Your dog is most likely bored. The itching is something thats natural for dogs. Maybe not as natural as your dogs itching. But get out side with a ball, have some fun with him. He'll soon forget about the itching. Just try to distract him as much as possible.     hope i helped|`|AA11287657	I don't know why your vet has not suggested food allergies!  I've had a lot of experiecne with this - dogs and cats.  If they are protected from all allergies pertaining to fleas, mites, ticks etc. the next logical question is what is your puppy eating?  Even the "best quality" supermarket dog foods that advertise they have no added colours or presrvaties etc. can be the cause.  My cat suffered severely with allergies - after only a week of feeding him tinned fish a good deal of his fur fell out! He was not only allergic to fish (a cat!) but other proteins as well.  Try an elimination process - I started with fresh raw chicken (if you can afford organic even better) which was a great relief but eventually had to use the "HIlls Science Diet Low Allergen Food" which you can get from vets and good pet shops. It did the trick!  Please talk to your vet again about this as soon as possible.  Hope puppy feels better soon!  PS. Only use natural fibres for your puppy's beeding.  Swap any chemical shampoos etc. (even if vet prescribed) and otp for completely natural chemical free ones.  Also dogs do not need bathing as often as we think - once a fortnight is sufficient if he's not extra dirty - brush with nautral bristle brush instead.  |`|NtYroZvxaa	It is perfectly fine for your puppy to take "time outs" as long as they are brief and in a safe area.  It sounds like your puppy may have food allergies or a skin infection of sorts.  I'm not sure if they did a skin cytology, but if not, you should go see a different vet or a doggie dermatologist.  For tonight, try giving him a T-shirt to wear.  It will help protect his skin.  Oh, and the baby powder is probably not a good idea.  As for the bleeding, I would do a very thorough check of his entire body -- does he have any sores that he broke open while scratching?  Any nicks or cuts?  These are all fine to wait until morning.  However, if there is severe bleeding or the bleeding doesn't stop, or if he is bleeding from the rectum, I would definitely take him to your nearest 24 hour facility.    Good luck.
1xwyCxdUaa	My cat is five, but he still does stuff like this.  When my cat is kneading me too hard, I gently lift up his paws and turn them away from me, maybe towards a blanket or something.  After I do this a few times, he gets the idea.|`|AA12284245	she thinks ur her mother shes suckuling on your neck like she would on her mums belly think about it?? its really sweet.|`|cudozYASaa	She is a baby who has just left her Mother and you are her substitute! She is trying to suckle bless her, and she will grow out of it to a degree as she gets older and more confident.    Ignore Bianca. What kind of heartless person would hit a defenceless kitten who was just missing it's Mother??!!|`|oJRGO637aa	You didn't say how old the kitten was when it was taken from the mother. She was most likely either not old enough to be weaned from her mother or didnt get enough suckling time with the mother (via other siblings). That is the only reason that kittens do this. You have now become the mother figure to this cat. Take very good care of her & good luck !|`|tVnFSoSsaa	She's obviously trying to mimic what she'd do suckling her mother. It's nothing to worry about, she'll grow out of it. Next time, put her by her milk bowl and she should drink that, if that's what she's after.    My cat licks everything. And tries to suckle my 3-year old male cat!|`|rv4IRsSpaa	CUTE!  But don't worry, it's just a cat thing... she'll grow out of it  (I wish i had a kitten)|`|NjOmMVZ7aa	She is still very young, and needs to suckle on something! You're a mother substitute. Why not trim her claws (ask the vet to show you how) and then it won't hurt so much! I had a Siamese who suckled on my earlobe for years -- and I have a Somali who aged four still likes to snuggle and 'tread' against me!|`|WqsJf4kgaa	I think it's to comfort the kitten, simply because they miss their mums, and because this is the action used when they want feeding or milk. Most cats will do it, and they don't simply grow out of it.  My cat does it all the time and he's nearly 14 years old!    Sorry. x|`|u7vrul2Faa	She is still young but if you don't put a stop to this now she may continue doing it through to her adulthood. It's hard but all you can do is gently nudge her away when she disturbs you and say a gentle but firm no, don't feel bad this is also how Mother cats discipline their kittens when they get out of hand.
AA11287657	My cat does this everytime without fail.  I think it's because the first thing I do when I wake up everyday is use the bathroom and then immediately give him his breakfast.  I think he thinks if I go into the bathroom its "food time".|`|qk769xdoaa	good question, my cat does that to, i think he just wants to be in there with you (we call it the bathroom buddy)|`|fU7RhebTaa	Well i have a mancoon cat. one of the biggest cats you can own. And she is evil. But she meows cause she justs wants some attention. So either let it in the bathroom or just let it meow.|`|1y84mVoMaa	love that is weird cause my cat does the same thing to well i started to leave the door open when i am in the bathroom just a little bit so she can come in after me so now she don't meow any more solved my on problem with smoke she is 3 years old                           :)las08 |`|129movX6aa	She might want attention.

Whenever I am in the bathroom or my mother is in the bathroom he would meow by the door, and sometimes paw at the door (he is declawed) because he wants to go into the bathroom because it is warmer in their.
aC4TB6Czaa	Ok this has totally happened to me before ... but not for a leg... anyways, first of all, there is no way I would let that vet put my cat under anesthesia just to remove a leg splint! I hate my cats being put under for anything! It's just like a small child, each time they are anesthetized there is a risk of something bad happening.  I can see him wanting to splint it, but this is an overreaction if he cannot give you a good reason why that cat needs to be unconcious to remove a splint that was put on the cat while it was awake??! The costs are going to be ridiculous.     My cat was throwing up and acting strangely for the first time in his life (he was about 6 when this happened) so I took him to a vet (it was afterhours) they hooked up the iv, came out with a clipboard and asked for a $750.00 deposit that night - they needed to keep him for testing, mri, sonogram and constant monitoring of his body temperature and iv fluids. bla bla. The next night after work I went in and the vet told me it was his kidney and he needed it removed. I flipped! Im a single mom and my son is begging me to not put his cat down, but I HAVE RENT TO PAY and I just gave them $750 without surgery yet??! She said "oh, yeah, the bill is $1150 now after the MRI and Sonogram this morning" HELLO! I owed over $1000 and his kidney was still kickin it inside of him! I told her to let me have him and I would send her a check. I thought I called around the next day and found a local vet who did the surgery for $600.00 with aftercare and everything. So he's my $1700 cat with one kidney. He's 10 now and healthy, but for a bill of $1100 just to diagnose????????????     So it does happen.. alot unfortunately.|`|AA11287657	It depends on how bad the sprain was - but I don't like the idea of putting an animal through general anaestheitc (if that's what you mean by sedation) for something that wasn't necessary.  Call your local animal protection society and ask them what they think - if they think it was totally unnecessary - they may investigate the vet.  If found to be overtreating and overcharging you'll then know not to take your pets there again and could get compensation.  It's worth checking into - especially for prevention of any mistreatment to any other animals|`|ZcVhWxoiaa	You know, it really depends on the vet. You can try calling another vet and seeing what they would do in that situation. Point is, you need to trust your vet. If you don't, you really should find a new one. One of my cats had a serious injury before, puncture to her belly (never knew what happened to her after a night out from escaping the house), and the vets racked up a $900 vet bill and still hadn't done xrays or ANYTHING. All they did was clean it up (shave, put cream in) not even stitches. They really ripped us off. Yea dont go to Banfield!  Some vets do rack up the bill but ask the vet to explain it to you. Sometimes they really do care about the animal :)    |`|d0eaf72e5abcf572854010d8680d6a10aa	Bet you would sue if the vet did nothing and the cat died. Just pay the man/woman.    Better still, pay another vet to give you a second opinion or be an expert witness in your court case. Hire a good QC/attorney or a big team.|`|4x6Gkm86aa	No, I believe the vet is over doing it. Depending of course on the severity of this injury and the nature of the strapping, these are variables I could not possibly know.  My mother's cat had a stitches and strapping after a fall from the roof (this cat did not believe in landing on it's feet...hopeless). When it came time for the next vet visit, my mother simply cut the strapping off herself (take my advice, a blanket to wrap up kitty's sharp sharp claws is essential), and pulled the stitches out with steralised scissors and tweezers. When she rang the vet he actually admitted to her that it was just simply a proceedure put in place for those less savvy to protect the animal's welfare, but he was quite happy that she had done it.  I guess some vets/people believe that it will cause the animal less distress, and less likely hood of the animal being more seriously injured from having to be restrained while the strapping is removed. Why don't you ask your vet straight out what the reasons are, and assess it from there.  Best of luck with kitty. I hope she doesn't get into any more fights.|`|kcB9fnT5aa	With regards to sedation, it isn't actually the same as a general anesthetic, it's a much lighter version which can usually be reversed very quickly. As to what the vet's have done for your cat it's impossible to say if it has been 'over the top' which comes directly back to what others have said, find a vet you feel you can trust, recommendations from other pet owners are by far the best way of finding a good vet. I do believe that some vet's are more expensive than others but this usually applies to all their prices across the board and to all their clients. They didn't just decide to push the boat out just for you! Can I also suggest that pet insurance, especially for a non pedigree cat isn't that much per month and is a godsend if the unexpected happens|`|9VV8qic0aa	 It's impossible to know if this is correct treatment or not as you only have their word that the diagnosis / treatment is correct, it could be a nasty bite and not a sprain!!??!.  You have to trust the vet you use and I agree with going 4 personal recommendations or asking cats protection charity who has good reputation.  It's like drs I guess some are ethical others send u 4 loads of tests 2 bump up the bill!  I think you have to go with his/her opinion this time as you've already started treatment but look into finding a different vet 4 future dramas.  It sounds odd 2 sedate 2 remove strapping though, unless your cat is particularly aggressive.   A nurse should be able to hold her whilst it's removed!!!   If you're not happy you could always get another vet to remove strapping??|`|VMY7No0eaa	Yes I think SOME VETS do things to run up the bill.... after all they have to pay for all that expensive equipment!     Or this was just the way she learned to treat this problem???|`|3GAiVmEAaa	You need to ask other vets in your area this question. Some vets may overdo it a bit, but they are the ones that went to veterinary school. They know more than us, so we need to trust them. Sometimes this means getting second opinions, but this does not mean getting advice from people with unreliable knowledge. Its fine to do what you are doing here by just trying to see whats "normal", but really it can be worse to get too many opinions. Careful here, a lot of people don't know what they are talking about and suggest things that can do more harm than good.|`|S9tilPJMaa	I have had cats with leg injuries, and the vet has always told me to keep the cats still, no jumping etc  hahahahha    It does sound like a bit much (my cats have always healed on their own in time), my vet has never suggested such a thing. It does seem like it would keep the cat off of the leg giving her time to heal though. 
icxax4braa	Take it to someone who knows what they're doing.  Id recommend an equine vet.  Why do you have a pregnant horse if you dont know how to raise a baby?|`|AA12189965	wow you have a world of problems dont you wolf.. lightning.. horses running away... or maby your a troll..:) a mare would NEVER leave her foal... and if she did spook she would come right back.. stop asking stupied questions.. or get rid of the livestock and move back to the city!|`|AA11618519	ummmmm  maybe she knows how to raise the baby but there are some things a mother horse does a human cant!|`|KbDDqOOjaa	well take it to the vet, and take care of it! it's your family now!
g62woUDQaa	Do you have a strong emotional attachment to this horse?  If not, I would think their owners should be there, and unless they want you there for some reason, it should be a private moment between them, the vet, and their horse.  Last thing people need at a time like that is extra observers.  Now, if you have been highly involved with horse and have an emotional attachment, you could ask the owners if they minded if you attended to pay your last respects as well, but again, it should be their decision whether they want you there or not.  |`|BCZ1ezXMaa	yes|`|IMPvzBk1aa	It would be nice if you could be there for moral support.  It is very difficult to go through the euthanasia and then deal with the business of disposal and so forth.|`|QTT9380Yaa	no  it is their business  if i was puttin my horse to sleep i wouldnt want my stable owner to be there to see me like crying   but thats kinda just me|`|5eNGp8TRaa	I think you should. They may need help with something, and since you are the property owner, it kind of makes sense to be there. Also, if you are close to the boarders, you may just want to be there as emotional support.|`|6GehblM3aa	If they say it's okay for you to stay, you can...but if they don't give you permission, I wouldn't.  Putting down horses gets very emotional for the owners/riders, and you should keep your space.  |`|nLmk1J7Xaa	If you can handle it. And also if it is a good friend or something than you should probably go. But if you can't handle it than you don't have to go. But I would if they were close to you! hope this helps and Good Luck!|`|XMc85Ir3aa	Well it depends whether you can handle it or not. Yes if you think you can handle it and no if you think you might go hysterical.|`|TJOcIlDTaa	i think if you can keep it together and be strong for them but if your gonna burst into tears then i wouldnt be there cause it makes them fell worse .|`|AA10346776	It will be one of the hardest things you ever do. Make sure you are in the right frame of mind. If it is for health reasons or necessary they will be at peace and no longer suffering.   Having said that though there are always risks the process will not go smoothly and it could be a very traumatic experience beyond the obvious loss. Sorry you are having to face this difficult decision.|`|t0jrxgxnaa	Yah definitly, it is always good to be there for someone.  And im sure after that they will need everyone around them to help after they do that.  |`|4zsvYuB1aa	Definately be there. Your boarders are going through a VERY tough time and it would definately help a little if you were there. I also reccomend watching the horse, if you can, pet him. Imagine how the horse would feel if no one could bear to watch his life end? As he passes away, he would like his owner there. If the boarders cannot watch and you tried explaining this, watch for them just to let them know "hes gone". Give them hugs for us.
Wn3LGHTvaa	If you can read body language in a human, you should be able to learn your dog's body language. They may not be the greatest orators in the world but dogs have a way of making their desires known.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	i know exactly what you mean one dog i use to have a rottie i use to always say he was almost human ,i knew exactly what he was thinking and knew what he was going to do next|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	I know how to read my dog just as much as I knew how to read my daughter when she was a baby. The same way a mom can tell if a cry is a cry from being hungry or tired or hurt...I can read exactly what my dog wants when he barks, whines or growls. |`|AA10633259	Yes, they may not be able to speak to us as we think but they do communicate and if you put in enough effort it is possible to understand them. |`|6c30b5116a79d741042462d73fcdf99aaa	I sure do...I understand my dog's every whim.....because I have raised him since he was 2 weeks old..and we are inseparable!|`|hov037Giaa	of course! i know everything my staffordshire terrier is thinking. i can ask her if she wants to see daddy and she barks. i can tell when she wants to lay in a certain spot, i know when she is hungry, needs to go out wants to play, etc. because she tells me. she is like my kid. i love my Duchess(thats her name). she understand human language better than some humans i know! you can talk to her like a human and if you pay attention she will answer you!|`|PHeynBKAaa	I believe it can be possible.|`|t1xQgysGaa	yes|`|YoZZDqq9aa	absolutely yes, and vice versa|`|5LMKcPinaa	Yep I pretty much know what mine would do in any given situation, and I can tell when they are uncomfortable or about to bite, etc. etc.|`|VYjERUo9aa	I depends on how strong the bond is between the dog and owner, obviously if you are around it a lot you can probably tell from certain signs what is on your dogs mind|`|9fdb1aec1eec12317a40aebc48023ffbaa	It all depends on how much time you spend with your dog. Yes it is possible.  Why? Again it depends on you. You do not have to try to master any code from the dog whisperer or any other trainer.  If you spend time you will automatically be able to tell your dog's mannerisms. You will be able to tell how your dog holds his tail, how he stands, if he moves cautiously or quickly, if he looks at you for your reaction etc.  It is something each dog although have similarities, your dog will be unique to you and you can learn his feelings and emotional ups and downs just by being with him and observing his tail, eyes and hair.  HE WILL LET YOU KNOW and after spending time with him everyday YOU WILL without a doubt or even realizing it will start to "read" him as he will you.  You are his most important information/emotional track. He is watching you and your emotions and he will act accordingly to your responses to ALL situations.  Good luck.
I7IS3RU1aa	Well, spaying/nuetering them calms them down. I don't think you guys should have opened up your home to 2 animals in need of just that if you didn't think you could handle a young cats behavior. I can see being frustrating with things being broken, but leaving hair on counters is as if your mom is mad because you got hair in the tub. Cabinets can be closes, as well as magnets replaced. When you catch the cats in the act, pick them up, say no & give them a tap on the nose. Try this for a few days if nothing changes, get a spray bottle & fill it with water. When you see them in the act, give them a spritz. They're eventually catch on. They take time, just as a small child would. So ask your parents if they'd be able to sleep at night knowing they carelessly gave two cats away because they broke a few plant pots.    Add-on: "the only thing that happens that is annoying is when i get home". You said your parents are considering giving them away, however, that last thing you added clearly stated it's YOU that's annoyed by them. Maybe if you don't complain about doing it & show your parents you can be responsible, you can keep your cats.|`|j51RT5vAaa	they're young cats! ofcourse they'd want to mess around|`|AA11287657	Firstly, because you adopted these cats, it's possible they underwent stressful  circumstnces before you got them which may be adding to their beaviour.  But normally cats will adapt nicely to their environment when they have some "ground rules" set for them.  Eg. I adopted my cat and he never goes outside - for his safety - he is very happy, never meows to go outside, never jumps on kitchen benches - I do allow him to jump up and sit on window sills so   he can see the outside world.  Your cats may never have had any guidelines.  Plan of action:-  Whenever they jump on kitchen benches, or places you don't want them to, spray them them cold water (keep a spray bottle handy in every room becuase you need to try and do this  immediately you see them doing wrong, so they understand this consequence is from what they are doing right now).  At the same time, make a lound "hissing noise" - this is the noise they would hear from their mother cat, or any other cat to let them know they are crossing boundaries.  Cats hate being squirted with water, and will soon get the message.  Eventually you should just be able to make the hissing noise for them to get the message, and over time they will stop the behaviour alltogether.  I also immediately after you have "disciplined" your cats and they stop their bad behaviour, pat them in their favourite way and tell them "Goooood cat (or whatever their names are).  Also, your cats may be stressed as to whether they will receive food regularly and act this out - especially in the kitchen!  So make sure your cats are fed at the same time everyday, (not in the kitchen) beofre they get too hungry or begin meeowing for food - this keeps them calmer.  Lastly, make sure there are cat toys freely available, at least one scrathcing post, and whenvever they do show signs of friskiness, play with them with their cat toys,  This way they'll know that when they're in the mood to play they will be able to, and won't stress so much about their "discipline.  Hope it goes well for you all and your kitties!  |`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	two things, more things to play with and train them.    boxes, paper bags, tunnels made out of blankets and furniture, climbing tree/scratching post.  cats need to climb, explore small dark places, hide and play.    when they are bad, sternly say no, and show them the right way. if they are on a counter, say no, put on floor, praise.    edit - you do need to move breakables away from them. mine just knocked a box off the dryer next to me while i was writing this. she was bathing, it was in the way. stretch, push, crash.    i got an item in a box about 4' long yesterday. had the egg shell type packing material. one long 4" thick sheet on the bottom. box had a top that came off.  as i was walking through the house with the box to throw it out, the other cat cat came running over, all excited. i put it down for her. she sniffed, carefully stepped on the egg shell foam, jumped in. sniffed everywhere. sharpened her claws on the foam. bathed.  so i put the top on the box so it covered all but the last 1'. so the cat could get out.  she slept in it last night, napped in it a few times today, and just climbed back in it tonight.  something that simple has occupied her, on and off, for two days.  my point is, that is all it takes.  in your case, cut holes in the box. one will climb in and fight with the other one through the holes.|`|5puZgyBoaa	Get a spray bottle and fill it with a mix of water and vinegar, and spray them whenever they're getting into something they shouldn't be. It won't hurt them, they will start to associate the sensation of getting wet and the icky taste of the vinegar with whatever is was that they were doing, and hopefully after a few times stop doing to avoid the spray bottle.  This worked for my cat to stop getting on the counter, it got to he point where we didn't even have to spray her anymore, just getting the bottle made her run.|`|W8qpV8aKaa	Cats don't tend to settle down and become placid until they are around 5-7 years of age, and even then, depending on their breed, it may just be in their make up to be playful, curious and naughty.  I have one that does all the things that your two do, except that he is now 10, and he certainly doesn't look like he is going to settle any time soon.  I just learnt not to buy inexpensive ornaments, and to laugh at his antics.  But if you don't think that you can continue with them like this, then it is probably best if you found them new homes.|`|XwzyOPvAaa	If they are not spayed/neutered, this will calm them down a little. Also, give them attention! They need exercise and stimulation. Try getting them a cat tree.|`|0e5aa9be9a0156b1295159e20595140eaa	Yes, spay and neuter for one.    Second, is you need to get something that will stimulate them.....cat trees, scratching boxes, etc.|`|neOmTsZSaa	get them toys! cat climbing things, little fake mice, balls of yarn, scratching posts, they now have like weird grass stuff that you can buy for cats.., try to get them focused on other things that were meant for their enjoyment! maybe even as weird as this sounds take them on walks to get rid of a little of their energy and give them attention!   hope this helps!|`|IUfAt6C3aa	what do you want them to do, just lay there?  cats are very curious animals and if you make them go against their nature, you are being unfair to the cats.  your cats are also young and like children, they want to play.  as for the hair, if you don't brush them, they will shed.  cats do groom themselves, but they also need some care from their people.    first, read a book about cats.  then, get them some toys and some basic grooming supplies.  finally, enjoy them for what they are.  if you can't do that, give them away and get a couple of stuffed animals.    good luck, kevin.    edit note: vinegar is an acid and will burn your cats' eyes and throat and may damage their tooth enamel.  don't spray them with vinegar.|`|1nRXewAgaa	First of all I want to say that I empathize with the 'inconvenience' of pets who cause disturbances to your life.  I'm sure many people will say mean things about how you took responsibility for them and you should just suck it up.  But I understand how hard it can be to adjust to pets in your house.  The best advice I can give you is to try to adjust your own behavior and environment to suit the needs of your cats.  I know that sounds like a lot to do but it's worth it if it helps your house calm down.  If they open cupboards, get child locks.  If they break plant pots, get rid of the pots or don't put them high up where they can fall (I myself had to get rid of all my plants because my cats would dig in the dirt and knock the pots over).  The hair is the hardest issue.  It helps if you brush them regularly.  It keeps the shedding in your brush as opposed to the furniture and counters but some hair is unfortunately a part of of having a pet.  If they are long haired, you could get them groomed/shaved.  I know it sounds weird but my cat loves it losing his huge mane for the summer.    Oh and just so you know...it's near impossible to 'get rid' of adult cats without totally abandoning them in front of the SPCA's door.  Plus, the risk for them is high to be put down or never placed with a new home.  Do your best to meet their needs and they will calm down.  Hope that helps.

Much more social dog that will 'blend' better with the boxer's bubbly temperament.|`|7d368ce3259f72c03af8b203c6c90257aa	Sorry, my vote would be for the Great Pyrenees. |`|b8e1755da720b51020434b3175ed1c82aa	Most sites would say that the Bull Mastiff is the number one guard dog on the planet.  That is just not true.  I would go for a Cane Corso or the Presa.  You have to understand though that the Presa is likened to the pitbull in willingness to attack other dogs.  This is something to think about.  That said of the two you have chosen I would go for the Presa.  I personally own an Akita and Dogue de Bordeaux x Rottie.  I like big dogs aswell.    I would ask you to read up on the cane corso though.  |`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	They weigh pretty much the same, but bullmastiffs tend to be a few inches taller.    Presas tend to require a great deal more socialization and training than bullmastiffs. They are NOT for the faint of heart, and aren't just "stubborn." You must be incredibly firm, and work very hard to prevent aggressive tendencies. I don't mean to imply that presas are these monsters or anything; they're just a lot more strong-willed. As with any dog, they'd be sweethearts when properly socialized and trained, and by their breed standard, they're supposed to be fantastic with their families. Bullmastiffs need very firm owners, too; they're also working breeds, but over the years they've become a tiny bit more "mushy."    Bullmastiffs tend to be lazier than presas. That doesn't mean they're necessarily couch potatoes, but presas are intended to be serious working dogs, so you'll have to really work him or you'll end up with plenty of behavioral problems. (Of course, bullmastiffs need exercise too, don't get me wrong!)    From what I can tell, presas have tighter jowls than bullmastiffs. Bullmastiffs do drool and slobber, as with any loose-lipped dog.    Both dogs are severe with strangers and great with their families.   Both need tons of socialization.    I guess personally, I prefer the presa just because I feel like the bullmastiff is a rip-off of English Mastiffs such as mine. ;-)|`|AA11525891	Stay away from Presas. If you own a home, you can have your homeowners insurance canceled if the insurance company finds out or if you ever have to file a claim. they are on most companies banned lists. It was a pair of Presas that killed Diane Whipple in San Francisco several years ago. Here is a quote from a breeder website...""The Presa Canario is a very tame dog with the family. . . . However, he may not be a 'baby-sitter dog.' If the Presa is introduced in a family with children, it is necessary to teach the children how to treat and respect the dog for preventing any unfortunate inconveniences." Unfortunate inconveniences? Like biting them? The other question to ask your self is, are you ready and able to handle 120+ lbs of dog?
33ZomJRHaa	2 millions dogs are put down every year because people choose to buy a puppy from a breeder or pet store. Innocent animals in shelters are waiting for a home a 2nd chance and they cant get that cause someone would rather have one from a breeder. You can always find a puppy at a shelter or a young dog. I got mine and she was just a puppy. Their isnt a reason why you should buy a dog from a breeder. I would rather save a life then make one. You can teach yours shelter pet just as much as any other dog. They want the 2nd chance to have a loving home. Most people say shelters pet are more lovable because they have been through hell and back and they want the chance to live and be loved.|`|B7NPXRoqaa	Tell them about Foster parents. A foster parent will train a dog while they show the dog to potential buyers. A rescue team like Roger's Rescues, takes the dogs from way overcrowded shelters. Take me for example. my mom was going to foster a dog (my dad didn't want another. HA!) and so my mom contacted Roger's Rescues. Eloise (Originally named Blaze 339) was a spaniel mix, who was 6 months old, and was on the kill list *gasp* in an overcrowded shelter in Kentucky. We got her off of a truck and took her home and was immediately training her. We had quite a few offers for her, but eventually my mom fell in love with her, and we bought her (for only $200!). Suggest Foster parenting a dog for your brother. They can request sizes (not breeds or anything really specific) and age, and have a chance at training it. If they think that it would be too difficult, they can follow through with the fostering, and give it away to someone who wants it. More than likely, they will fall in love and refuse to give it away and buy it (for real cheap!). Yes, they probably won't be able to foster again (Rescue teams don't usually like people who buy their fosters) but they will have found a dog basically without knowing it. Good Luck!    Other Reasons to buy a rescue:  *can be older and already trained  *Cheaper!  *Breeders are sometimes neglected  *Saving a life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  *Can get mutts (the best of two kinds of dogs!)  *easier to get it, no waiting lists or anything  |`|TpOVmqpHaa	Well, it's ultimately their choice.  BUT, perhaps if you do some research and locate a few dogs in rescue, you may find one that steals their hearts.  A young adult would be perfect.... find some good info, show them pics, give them a nudge....but don't be pushy.  It's their dog, their choice.|`|AA11525891	There are Golden pups available from rescue all the time, just look on PetFinder.com. Besides doing rescue and showing I am also a breeder and I think that the ONLY reasons to buy from a REPUTABLE breeder would be if you wanted to show or if you wanted a full health guarantee. Other than that, even though many rescues come with "baggage", rescue pups usually don't and are just as easy to train as a breeder dog and a lot cheaper AND you will be saving a life!     One of the downsides to breeders is that you REALLY have to do your homework on them. Is the breeder a member in good standing of a pure breed club with a code of ethics? Does the breeder have a contract? Do the pups come with a health guarantee? Does the breeder have the right of first refusal? Are the parents available and will the breeder let you see them?    Here is a great article on why a rescue from the great Pyrenees Rescue Website library... http://sonic.net/~cdlcruz/GPCC/library/W...
wzpCMI44aa	Eww. You can't really, just try to keep them separated when one of them is pooping.|`|d7bcedc128f094df6e910173d672703eaa	My dog sometimes does that when I take her on walks. It is disgusting. I was told that if you add some pineapple to your dogs' food, they will stop eating poop. Since they are your own dogs and you have some control, this may work for you. I also like the idea of using cinnamon, as another yahoo person mentioned here.|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	Buy something like this:  http://search.onlynaturalpet.com/search....      -MDL|`|1ad7aa5Caa	That could be a sign of her lacking vitamins or minerals. Think about asking your vet if you should modify her diet.|`|JwqY7Yaraa	Try putting cheyenne pepper on the poop or even tobasco sauce. I know you said that you can't get there fast enough to stop him or her but i had this problem with my dog too. She would never eat her own but she would have no problem eating the other dogs poop. For a couple of days monitor when the dogs are going number two. After the small dog is done pooping  walk over sprinkle whatever you choose on it and make sure you leave it there to let the big dog take a sniff. Try it for a couple of days (but you have to  be persistent the dog won't change if you don't want to help them) hopefully the dog will realize that is burns to eat poop. Good luck it worked for me :)|`|AA11525891	We have had this issue pop up occasionally and we use "Blue Green Algae" powder sprinkled on the food of the dog producing the poop that is being eaten.  It changes the "taste". You want to be VERY careful though. Blue-green algae in its natural form and in the wild can be very toxic to dogs. Also, you want to use only the BGA that is harvested form controlled environments as some manufactures harvest it from outside ponds and lakes that are polluted and some of the toxins make it into the product. We have Great Pyrenees and only use 1 capsule sprinkled on the dry food and only until the behavior stops.|`|qhBnW1wqaa	There is this stuff you can ask your vet about, it is something to sprinkle on their food, so when they digest it, the poop tastes bad. It will not hurt the dog in anyway.     Dogs eat other dog or cat poop because the animal doesn't digest the food entirely, so the poop still has some taste and smell of the dog or cat food. |`|GQEWNd7haa	2 choices i see, spray the poop with something that tastes awful like that sour apple stuff people use on chairs, or use an electric collar.    "How do you get a dog from eating poop?" should be "How do you keep* a dog from eating poop?"  Elsewise, you're trying to get a dog by.... eating poop...|`|EibnoZUPaa	you can buy Forbid at pet stores & put it in their food.      a reason for it may be low quality food so it does not digest all the way..the fillers and fake stuff they put in it comes out the other end just the same as when they ate it...so they think it tastes good.  for that, you can just switch to a higher quality food.|`|82dEyygHaa	You need to bring your dog (the poop eating one lol) to the vet. The vet will give you this powder to put on your dog's food. After eating this, the dog no longer wants to eat poo. I don't know how it works exactly, but i had the same problem with my dog and apparently it is very common. You gotta bring her to the vet thats all!|`|06tDxQl3aa	YUCCKK :(  a dog is going to eat what it wants but the only way to try and prevent it is everytime you see the dog near the poop, scold her and tell her no and hopefully she will learn not to do it.  also, praise her when she is outside and NOT eating the poop :)|`|7rCVptKBaa	It is usually because of a deficiency.  I would change their diet, to a better quality food.  There is also a poo eating deterent they sell.  But it won't help the deficiency.  You can call the vet and mention it.  They may advise a vitamin supplement.|`|nDnnUR1paa	The reason she eats your other dogs poop is cause it is not fully digested by other dog...a better quality food will prevent the food from not fully being digested!! If you buy food from the grocery you should start going to a pet store, my dogs eat science diet! Dogs will eat poop that is not fully digested cause out in the wild it saves them!    hope this helps!    |`|uD1S5dYtaa	I just read Dog Fancy magazine and someone asks that question.  The dog trainer from Animal Planet's "It's Me or the Dog" suggests you give your dogs some chunk pineapple.  She says the dogs like it but it makes their poop taste really bad.  Give just a little of the pineapple daily until the dog stops, then every once in a while just to remind him. |`|OFdl7kUPaa	well u should wash her carfully then |`|0x0Umi0Qaa	Feed the little dog cinnamon it works ever time. good luck|`|f61VvMeQaa	Feed then real dog food not that cheap crud but something better than those 1 dollar cans|`|Ffdk1meFaa	My dogs eat poop too- they don't eat each other's poop, but they may eat other dogs' poop or deer poop, etc. It doesn't seem to hurt my dogs so I wouldn't worry about it, just keep trying to discourage it and make it hard for her to get to it.|`|JeKwhD9Gaa	well i dont realy know besidews keeping your dog away from the bull      lol put hotsauce on it......sorry|`|a6XQXYhlaa	My vet gave us this powder that is called Forbid. I think you can get it online through petmeds.com.  sprinkle some on the food, and it gives the poo a nasty taste..(at least i assume!) worked pretty good for our shih tzu's..but we still have to pick it up right away, or they think they are at a poo buffet. very gross...|`|IczwDnJOaa	There is a product for it called for-bid. You can get it at petsmart. You feed it to the dog whos crap is being eaten. So it tastes bad.|`|Bh4pmYnSaa	use lemon spray... either spray their poop with it and they will eventually get the hint that thats not good    or pick it up    or just let him eat it|`|UtpN8Fy7aa	This is a common problem with dogs. You can get some of this to sprinkle on both your dogs foods to discourage. You can also try talking to your vet about the issue:    http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/pr...|`|z2sTerkKaa	I totally agree with Jayme's answer.  I was going to suggest the same thing.|`|FLoNESv3aa	I was watching It's Me or the Dog and she gave the dog pieces of pineapple for that reason saying that the pineapple would make the dogs poo taste bad.|`|xQLkCqqFaa	well my puppy eats he's own poop too dont look to much into it just try to pick it up as soon as possible. also i know theres this thing u can buy that you spray on there poop and it freezes it. maybe u can try that too

I'd also forbid my sister to ever touch any of my animals after I pound her for being so careless and stupid!|`|AA11310065	You should take the hamster to an emergency vet tonight and not wait. In addition to inviting infection, the animal will be in continuous pain for the next ten hours.It was irresponsible enough to play with the animal without understanding its frailty but even more so to not seek medical attention immediately.    I only pray that you are not delaying taking the little animal to the vet because it may cost a few dollars more.|`|icxax4braa	You need to go to the emergency vet.

Really?  You are serious?    A "MALTIPOO" is a MUTT.  YOU WILL NEVER HAVE A PUREBRED.|`|RPZyku2Jaa	Please, please, please go away and stop asking questions about breeding your mongrel.  A mutt is a mutt is a mutt ... you will never, never get a full blooded maltipoo because there is NO SUCH THING!|`|EibnoZUPaa	Oh jeez...here we go.    A Maltipoo IS a mutt.  Can I breed my border collie /heeler with a dalmatian and make a purebred border heelatian?    Nope, just mutts.|`|lMBjgIFZaa	Its not true, you can breed your dog with a poodle and be fine the next litter. You do understand though, that breeding your maltipoo with a poodle is just making another maltipoo??? No matter what you do, your dog will never be a purebred, its a mutt already. I dont see anything wrong with mutts, but you cant call its a pure bred or pure blooded, because its not. Just like goldendoodles, labradoodles, jugs, etc. You can easily find maltipoos in shelters because they are just mixed breed dogs. So to answer your question, if your dog and the poodle breed, itll be fine, ur just making more maltipoos.|`|PORQhMiCaa	a so called maltipoo, is a poodle MIXED with maltese it is not PUREBRED. therefore  what you were told is TRUE.|`|LcdaUleUaa	Your malti-poo is a cross between a Malti and a poodle.  If you breed her with another Malti-Poo, you'll get dogs similar to malti-poos, but it wont be the same.   This is why a malti-poo can't be considered a pure breed.    The only way to make a proper malti-poo is to breed a pure bred malti with a pure bred Poodle.    If you were to breed your dog with a poodle, you'll get pups that are 1/4 malti, 3/4 poodle.  Your dog wont be ruined  (well it probably will because you don't know anything about breeding or even basic math, logic and genetics).  Assuming she isn't killed or rendered sterile in this poorly thought out adventure, breeding her with another malti-poo after will still result in malti-poo-ish dogs.        |`|lMJBaacxaa	you will never have pure blooded maltipoos. A maltipoo is just a mutt, so therefore it will create mutts no matter what you breed it with. By the way, if you breed your mutt, it will ruin your day anyway.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	She's already ruined!! Too late! Have her spayed.    These have to be troll questions, nobody is this silly.|`|lhbpBnBAaa	Troll.|`|SIKCfUtjaa	you will never have full blood multipoos because it is not a breed... 
EibnoZUPaa	Not a chance in the world you have any dalmatian in there.  The body is not even close, not big enough, head is not right, ears are not right...     Just because it has black spots, doesn't mean it's a dalmatian.    sorry!|`|ybjchpe0aa	I don't think that he is anything to do with dalmation. Way too small. Lots of dogs have freckles. He look alot like a king charles. I don't see the pomeranian. Some other like of spaniel i would have to say. But definetly not dalmation.|`|AA11525891	It is not unusual for many white breed of all shapes and sizes to have spots under their coats. Great Pyrenees are a generally all white breed with spots or patches on their skins that don't even show on their coats. Your dog doesn't have any Dal in it at all.|`|f46ac79782011df203ccb9768414aec1aa	he looks like a KCC x Pom but if not Pom hes papillion, very cute though|`|RPZyku2Jaa	No Dalmation at all - your dog is too small to have any Dal.  Many dogs can have those black spots, and since you have a mutt, there's no way of telling what kind of markings they'll have when they grow up.|`|gyoLWPD8aa	nope. definitely not. he just has spots!|`|LdWh47Ttaa	no sorry, but i highly doubt that.|`|U4WZVU55aa	he is adorible!! but not dalmation.      sorry for my spelling!|`|NULgHGKkaa	Nope, no dalmation, it looks alot like a cocker spaniel or britney spaniel! |`|kN3wHeXeaa	No, definitely no Dalmation. I have seen border collies and aussie shepards with black spots so Dalmatians are not the only possibility.|`|pDpyFlV9aa	Not a chance that dog has any dalmatian in him at all.  Some dogs have spots, doesn't make them dalmatians.|`|DeaRdZV0aa	no and i see the pom in him|`|bMEqCaKHaa	what a cutie-pie!!! you are so lucky that he seems to be mostly king charles and less pom (no dal in there) lots of bennies.... great with kids, not alot of grooming, love to be lap dogs, good all-round temperament! socialize of course cuz of the pom in him, you dont want him to be an "ankle-bitter", snippy, or a barker and way too protective to the point of being a problem.... so any of those traits will come mostly from the pom in him and you will need to curb that. (no offense towards poms...i love them too! most just seem to get babied and take advantage of that :) |`|179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	Zero dalmation.  That's just pigmentation, and because it's a mutt, god only knows where it came from!    Many breeds have spots, my mother's Chihuahua has spots on his belly, my American Pit Bull Terrier has TONS of spots    He was actually born without them, and by 4 weeks, all his spots had shown up.  The spots don't show up several months down the road, they show up in the first few weeks of life.    http://i533.photobucket.com/albums/ee334...|`|icaatrmhaa	No dalmation. I don't see any pomeranian either. I definitely   see papillon, especially in the facial structure. So, I would   say he's a papillon/Cavalier King Charles mix.

ac92f82f4d5b3f3af2d01d0117d482cbaa	The song: 'If Everyone Cared' by Nickelback  rips my heart out after confiscating dogs from puppy mills. The horrendous images never go away.     The ache in your heart has to take a back seat to protocol. Everything is done with a well set plan before you can gain access to a property. You have procedures to follow and cannot have a melt down of emotions until the confiscation is complete. The ride home is always very quiet.   Missouri is the capitol of puppy mills in the US. The puppy mill cycle will never be broken unless people re think buying designer dogs and pet shops sell only gold fish.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Yes they can be "that bad".  The animals are not healthy, not socialized and nothing more then breeding machines - being bred on EVERY heat cycle and as soon as one litter is born, they are rebred till they die (which can be in a few years).    The pups/kittens are not given any shots, not socialized, kept in small overcrowded cages and generally very unhealthy.  The "lucky" ones die - the others  are taken from mom far too soon (not even weaned) and stuffed into more cages to be shipped to the local "pet shops" which again, put them in another cage.    And people wonder why the cute puppy or kitten is so unhealthy and badly bred, no socialization, etc.|`|Za8DpfvQaa	Yes, it is really that bad. There was an Oprah, where they took you in, to see what a puppy mill looked liked.    And yes,it looked exactly like this...  http://www.westierescueofmissouri.com/pu...    Horrible, isn't it?    The Oprah show...click here for the video:    http://www.oprah.com/slideshow/oprahshow...|`|k6flESfNaa	yep.     it wasnt a horrible factory tho, it was a neighbor we had when we used to live on the ranch. they all kinds of dogs it was scary.     no lie, it was 100+ dogs on that property.|`|P9qxsLNQaa	A lot of puppy mills are filthy places as you have heard and probably seen pictures of online but some are not.  The true definition of a puppy mill is a place where dogs are bred solely for money, not to improve the breed in any way.      So you can see, if you think about it a little bit, that most of the BYBs (back yard breeders or "hobby breeders") are actually small puppy mills.  The people who bred these dogs may have very clean homes and up to date vaccinated dogs but they are only breeding for money...or fun...or to "show the children the miracle of birth"...or because the mating was an accident.  As long as the pups are sold for profit, it's a mini puppy mill.|`|AA11525891	Yes....Dogs in crates to small to move around in. Dead dogs in piles. Sick and injured animals everywhere. Females having the life bred out of them with repeated breeding. I have also fostered Great Pyrenees that have been seized from them. Not a pretty picture.|`|41c28e73f9b063aa3838e17f7834ec97aa	Youtube has some videos.|`|7a0b8d7dd5636ea72eeaaf763882e180aa	ive been to many, some on raids, others rescues, others undercover.    the first thing you notice is the smell, even in very clean places theres still that lingering odor.    the next thing you notice is how many sad looking (and usually underweight and not groomed) dogs are stuffed into tiny places...    ive never seen such sad eyes...there cramped and you can tell any one of them would give anything for some kind of love, attention...most have never been touched by a human beyond food and pulling of the puppies.    the puppies are usually pulled form mommy very early too and the mothers bred EVERY heat to keep production up...    my heart sinks every time i step through the doors of places like that....  no dog should be kept like that, you can see the broken soul behind every pair of eyes...for the dogs lucky enough to have both eyes!    i think the best comparison would be..  puppymills feel like concentration camps, cages filled with broken souls.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	I have, I went on a rescue mission when I worked at a shelter a few years back, and I will never forget that smell.    Imagine walking into a room thats filled with dead dogs, stagnant water, moldy food, feces, urine, and the afterbirth of 200+ litters. Its horrible.    If it wasn't for the sheer drive to get those animals out of there, I would have ran one billion miles away just to forget it.     The male dogs were emaciated, the females were exhausted, terrified, and nutritionally deprived. Their teats hung to the ground where puppies weren't clinging to them. The PUPPIES were in filthy conditions ranging from being nestled in the bodies of other female dogs that had passed away during birth, or starved to death.     There were no windows, no vents, no fans, no heating, one light in the middle of the room, and a drain in the center. There were travel kennels, and chicken wire cages stacked to the ceiling, all of them packed with dogs that were barking, crying, whining or dying.|`|rawz0RJuaa	I have once and it really was horrible. I actually ended up taking a little girl yellow lab home because she came and climbed in my lap and i could NOT leave her there!! She had AKC papers but it was a bad situation and I had to argue with the sellers on their insane price because of the conditions. This pup is now 6 years old and has suffered from extreme ear infections since the day I got her from these horrible people (and believe it or not, the couple I bought her from who had this mill were both cops!) But I just wanted to say this about Pet Shops, you are right about many, but there are also many pet shops that use, and give you verification that the animals they are selling come from quality breeders. I looked in to this when I was looking for a puppy just recently. I actually found a good pet shop where they buy from breeders, and even let you talk to the breeder and whatever you need to feel satisfied that you are buying quality. Granted they jack the price up a bit but if pet shops are going to be in business at all it should be this way- not supporting the abuse of dogs and puppies.|`|InzHK1rcaa	No but I did a report on them, and researched A TON! It's horrible! I can send you the report... dogs live in cramped spaces getting no excersize, hardly any food...  Also, its like the females have puppies, then six weeks later (WAY TO EARLY! Puppies wouldnt have had enough time to bond with siblings and parents... so there's a high chance of aggresive behavior.) they are taking away from her. The next day, they'll get her pregnant again. It's horrible. True torture. And that's less than half of the crap that goes on there.
ohKOucliaa	Can you have n Alaskan Malamute?  They are great dogs, if you have only one.  They are dog aggressive so a firm hand and good training are necessary.

They're great dogs, from what I understand, and the ones I've been around have been extremely lovable, despite their breed history as guard dogs.  Or, why don't you go to the AKC website and look through the working and herding breeds (or others; don't be limited to those; hounds and sporting would be other great bets for bigger dogs).    Here's the working group page.  Just go to the "breeds by group" tab on the left to change it to something else (I recommend looking at them broken down into groups rather than as one, huge list so you're not overwhelmed).    http://www.akc.org/breeds/working_group....    Good luck!|`|FMqmUAjiaa	I have had wonderful experiences with labs. I always took my black lab everywhere when I was younger. He was my hunting dog but he was very calm. As a puppy though, well thats a different story, but that is quite normal for any dog. My chocolate lab is just a sweetheart and loves everyone. But she is also a good watch dog and will remain cautious with strangers until I let her know its okay. This would be what you where looking for with the protective instincts. Labs are very loyal to their owner and truly will be your best friend. |`|hL83j7qXaa	Border Collie.  They have A LOT of energy, but they will also be content to lay at your feet for the evening.

They're not usually recommended for first time dog owners, but if you do your research and talk to husky people you can probably handle one.    Huskies are 40-65 pounds    They rarely bark, but they do howl, groan, moan and make other weird noises    They are very friendly dogs, but the average idiot thinks they look like wolves and are afraid of them. I have people cross the street when they see me walking mine.    They aren't velcro dogs that have to be with you all the time, they prefer their independence.    When they get older they tend to be friendly, yet reserved, with strangers.    When they receive proper exercise, they are just fine chilling at home. My guys get a 3-5 mile walk a day and the rest of the time they just hang out on the couch with me.|`|tCbN2F7iaa	border collie, lab, goldendoodle, labradoodle |`|ybjchpe0aa	First i would tell you to take a look at your local kill shelters, you can find a nice lab mix of some sort that isn't very hyper. Most dogs at a young age are going to be hyper and require lots of attention and playing to get rid of that hyperness. Other breeds that are good are Shiba Inu's, pugs, labs, goldens, husky, dobs, there are so many to choose from, but just start at a shelter and just feel the dog out, if he comes right to you all waggy i wouldn't worry about beings unpredictable. They are just looking for a forever home too. Good luck
xfRyLbyKaa	Emily has some very good tips.  If you puppy is only about 8 weeks old and you said she's been biting for awhile then she was probably weaned a little early.    She would of learned the manners of not biting hard from her litter mates and they would of done exactly as Emily suggested.  They would let out a high pitch whelp or cry which tells the pup it's too hard.  I have a 14 mo rott that used to do this.  Every time he mouthed me I would yell ouch like he was hurting me even if it didn't hurt.  Do that every time and she will stop.  Also, do not rough house with her until this habit is broken.   |`|pc7ZjexJaa	get a kong toy    freeze a steak bone and give it to him to chew    giving a puppy away for teething is just plain dumb. if its something shes even considering then shes not ready for a dog.    every puppy does it.    they have special chew toys.  and when he bites you tell him NO very firmly. or make a high pitched squeak/yelp|`|AA12184374	Chop off its muzzle. It won't be able to bite.|`|hRikwc00aa	It's just a normal puppy behavior - don't worry, he's not aggressive, just teething. Here are some tips on bite inhibition, make sure you share them with the rest of your family too.    1. Whenever his teeth touch your fingers, whether it be biting, nipping, or if he even just brushes his teeth against you, make a high-pitched yipping sounds (Yipe!) or, if you prefer, say "Ouch!" in a high-pitched voice. This is was his littermates and mother would do if he bit too hard.    2. If he backs off a little, praise him and resume playing or whatever is was you were doing.    3. If he doesn't get the message, wait for his teeth to touch you again. The moment they do, yelp, take his toy if he has one, turn around, walk away a few steps, and completely ignore him for 30 seconds or so. This means no eye contact, touching, or talking. When you resume playing, his bites should be softer or less frequent.    4. If he still doesn't get it, wait for his teeth to touch you. Yelp, walk away, leave the room and shut the door. If the room has no door, walk into a room with one and shut it. He'll quickly get the message that biting means the end of playtime. Leave him alone for 1-2 minutes and come back out.    This isn't a quick fix - his bites will gradually get softer and less frequent over time until he finally stops. Be patient! If you do this right, it will ensure that he won't bite anyone as an adult.|`|zAAZQWt4aa	whatever u do don't hit him, it could make him become aggressive. He is probably only trying to play with all of you by biting so i suggest getting him a lot of good chew toys from a pet store, maybe a rope or rubber toys, something you can interact with him while he is biting it, because playing with a stuffed animal by himself probably is boring to him. for long term results you should take him to a puppy training class because i used to work at petco and watched the puppies being trained and it really works! good luck!|`|AA11850029	your puppy is probably in a teething phase. stuffed toys will not satisfy his urge to chew. you can buy great chew toys at your local pet stores. the best one i found is called a nylabone. it's made of a very tough rubber and comes in different flavors. its a good idea to get something called sour lemon/orange. you spray it directly into the puppy's mouth when he does something you want him to learn not to do. eventually he'll recognize the bottle when you get it out and stop on his own. make sure that this and any other disiplinary method be used only as a teaching tool. for instance, if you use the spray on him when he bites, and then use the spray on him just because he makes a funny face when its sprayed in his mouth, the dog will not know the difference and won't learn what he is doing wrong.    you have to remember that puppies come with alot of energy and curiosity and its up to the owner to train him to their standards. the best thing to do is to play with him until he gets worn out and stick with him. dogs can be the most comforting companions when you need them the most. |`|Lpt8L8zBaa	Go to the pet store and get a bitter spray. It prevents them from biting things because they don't like the taste or the scent.|`|WNtUcohHaa	My technique is to close the pups muzzle every time he bites and tell him NO BITE! in a stern voice... if that doesnt work I grab under their chin and press my thumb down on their tongue and tell them NO BITE! , even though it sounds a little gross it's always worked for me. Its a very uncomfortable feeling for them and instead of trying to bite down they will try and back away. Be very firm and use an angry, threatening voice...if a soft voice is used like when you praise them they wont associate biting with being bad, it will be associated with praise and playfulness.     I hope it helps!|`|huMaqGh1aa	Do not let your puppy chew on people!! Give him chew toys and other doggie-things. Since he's teething, try wetting a washrag and then putting it in the freezer til it's nice and cold. Then let him chew on that. Remember, his gums hurt bad from the new teeth coming in and he's doing what he can to get some relief! Stop his chewing on you now, tho, or he'll keep doing it when he gets older (and his jaw and teeth are stronger!).|`|wKKhVLHiaa	Next time he bites you grab that little shyt by the ears and swing him in circles, while you are doing this you have to scream like a barbarian, making sure your war cry is loader then his yelps, after about ohhh 3 to 5 spins have a family member open the back door and launch his little biting **** into the yard. After only 3 or 4 times using this technique you should see amazing results. GOOD LUCK!!
9q2cy6xHaa	Hibernating! That doesn't sound normal at all. Her stomach shouldn't be extremely hard. If her breasts are swelling, but just because they're showing, doesn't mean she's pregnant. Actually, we were quite sure our hamster (same principle, really) was pregnant but, really, her stomach filled with fluid. It was fatal. So I'd suggest taking her to a vet if you're not sure.

2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	My bulldog Manny used to throw up yellow foamy bile at least once a week.  It happens when they have an empty stomach.  Is your bulldog eating all his food?  Manny used to throw up because he didn't like his old food and wouldn't eat much of it.  Later we found out that he was actually allergic to something in it and put him on a hypoallergenic diet.  It's been almost two months and he hasn't thrown up once since he started eating his new food!  Talk to your vet about switching out your bulldog's food to something either totally hypoallergenic or made from less common meats like venison or rabbit, and that should help him out.  Bulldogs are particularly known for developing allergies, so I wouldn't be surprised if that's his problem.  Good luck, fellow bulldog parent! : )|`|AA11310065	My dog was doing the same thing, the vet did some blood work and they found out he had a liver infection.|`|XgNsE2PEaa	My dog did this when she was a puppy because she would get so hungry in between her evening feeding (5pm) and morning feeding(7am).

De uma olhada:   A transmiss?o transplacentria foi a primeira a ser conhecida, porm a forma mais comum se d atravs da ingest?o dos oocistos presentes nas fezes de gatos, que contaminam verduras, legumes e a prpria terra e a ingest?o de cistos presentes em carnes cruas ou malcozidas, principalmente de porco e de carneiro.

0OyGno5Eaa	there is no such thing as a nitrate removal sponge, nitrates are removed by partial water changes on your tank with dechlorinated water.     the sponge filter media in your filter is there to give a large surface area for the bacteria (which turn ammonia into nitrites and nitrites into nitrates) a good strong bed, and also to trap larger particles from the water column.     this sponge needs rinsing and squeezing lightly to remove debris from it every week when you do your partial water change, it must be rinsed in old tank water or dechlorinated tap water, never use water untreated from the tap as it will kill off your bacteria and you will need to cycle your tank again.     these sponges will only ever need replacing if they literally start to fall apart, and then you will need to cut a small piece from your old sponge and place it in with the new sponge to seed your new filter media, leave it in there for a week or more to allow the bacteria to spread.    the only reason the filter manufacturers say to replace every month or whatever they say, is to increase their sales of their products. if you replace your filter media, you are removing the main bacteria bed from your tank, and will end up with a mini-cycle due to the bacteria needing to re-colonise your media and not being able to keep up with your bioload from your fish.|`|OsVswissaa	If your nitrates are high you control it with regular water changes, so the nitrate removal sponge is not necessary.|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	The only time you should even have this is if you are cycling a tank with fish in it.

The Persian cat is one of the oldest breeds of cat. In Britain, it is called the "Longhair" or "Persian Longhair". A Persian cat without an established and registered pedigree is classed as a domestic longhair cat.      Origin of breed    The Persian cat originates from the Iranian plateau, a large area between the Hindukush mountains and Mesopotamia traditionally known as "Persia" in the West, correspounding to the central territories of the Persian Empire. However, interbreeding of Angoras with native British domestic longhairs in the 19th Century makes the true origin of the breed unclear. The Persian's European debut is credited to Pietro Della Valle, an Italian traveller.        Persian cats can have any color or markings including pointed, tortoiseshell, blue, and tabby. Tipped varieties are known as Chinchilla. Point varieties are called Himalayan in the United States and Colourpoint Persian in Europe.    In the USA, there was an attempt to establish the Silver Persian as a separate breed called the Sterling, but it was not accepted and Silver and Golden longhaired cats, recognized by CFA more specially as Chinchilla Silvers, Shaded Silvers, Chinchilla Goldens or Shaded Goldens are judged in the Persian category of cat shows. In South Africa, the attempt to separate the breed was more successful: the SA Cat Council (SACC) registers cats with 5 generations of pure bred Chinchilla as a Chinchilla Longhair. The Chinchilla Longhair has a slightly longer nose than the Persian, resulting in healthy breathing and no tearing of the eyes. Its hair is translucent with only the tips carrying black pigment: a feature that gets lost when out-crossed to other colored Persians. Out-crossing also may result in losing nose and lip liner, which is a fault in the Chinchilla Longhair breed standard. One of the distinctions of this breed is the blue-green or green eyecolor only with kittens having blue or bluish purple eyecolor.        http://cdn-write.demandstudios.com/uploa...      http://www.gotthelookpersiancats.com/ass...      http://www.shadowlong.com/index.19.jpg|`|4gjAxw4saa	Hammerhead sharks.LOL.|`|IkHTD61Gaa	pursian ?

The average companion Dobermann will guard by barking an alarm.    One of my Dobermanns will barks whenever someone approaches the house, but will stand down immediatley on command. The other barks infrequently, but keeps a watchful eye on people who come near the house or come to the door.|`|ZxGAKWHQaa	She knows it's you... why would she bark?!

Dobermans are VERY perceptive... they know what any given situation requires. Mine don't bark if someone comes to the door while I'm awake and available in the house, but they DO bark if I'm in the shower... they don't bark if there is some loud strange noise during the day (they just try to see what it might have been), they bark and stay on alert for a while if there is a little noise outside the window after we've gone to bed.

RZAjrv8Xaa	well you need to do your research first. depending on your home and where you live and so forth. there are only a few "BIG" types of dogs out there. Research bigger dogs on the internet and find one that suites your life style. "nice" looking shouldn't be a reason to pick an animal either. check out the breeder and the home its coming from the parents and its temperament. or check out a pound dog lots of big dogs there that no one ever wants. "they're too big" everyone says. I'd say go a few times and if you find one that you like, come back and bound or check its personality to see if it matches with you. save a life, and adopt!
TpOVmqpHaa	You're on the right track.....look for one of those cheap little fanny packs or treat pouches and keep that on at all times.  Periodically call the pup to you, have him sit, and give him a yummy reward.  As he wanders off again, perhaps getting interested in something else, call him again.   It will obviously be harder in new places and with new people or animals around, but if you lay a good foundation at home first, it will help tremendously.    Some dogs do require a bit of correction or a 'reminder' that they 'must' listen to you.  So it's a good idea to put a long line on the pup in these situations.  Let him get near the end of the line, distracted with someone or something, then call him back.  If he doesn't immediately come, give a quick snap to the line.  This is usually all that's required, but in some cases you may need to correct more than once, and potentially start running backward a bit to entice him to you.  It's very important that until a pup or dog is reliable in all obedience commands, that you not set yourself up for failure.  This means that if you call your pup to you, you need to be equipped to enforce it if he chooses to ignore you.  In other words, don't call him unless you have your treats, leash, etc at the ready, and enforce the rule.   Calling a dog repeatedly only reinforces the idea that he can ignore the first, second, third command, etc.  Call once, then correct.  Be firm but gentle. Motivate first, discipline second.  Good luck, and have fun!!|`|tDUPkdgUaa	to train him to come, put him on a long leash in an open area. call him, and reward him when he comes. if he doesn't come when you call, pull him with the leash. that's what its for, and also to prevent him from going too far and not coming back at all. repeat that gradually extending the length of the leash. once you are confident enough, you can take him to a confined area and try the command again. if he doesn't come within the first call, go get him, leash him up, and do it again.    when you're at home and he's distracted, "bite" him. take your hand and tap him very firmly on the shoulder blade with your fingertips. don't worry about pain. its just gonna direct his attention to you when you do that. praise him when he does that and reward him.    :]|`|76nTvO4iaa	Puppies are easily distractable, so as he matures he'll do better.   It sounds like you're on the right track.  Keep working with him.  As he matures, he'll be able to manage the distractions better.|`|AA12128656	don't use cheese. kibble is fine.  remember that he's a pup, and this is why training is work.  once he's got it 100% down at the house, gradually work in situations where there's distraction. distraction training is more difficult than kitchen training, but once you have it down, you'll be so happy.  it always helps to start with a hungry pup.  if you ask him to do a command, and he fails to, DO NOT let it go. since he's a pup, be nice about it, but make sure he does it.  then let him do what he wants. part of training a young pup is making sure he knows he'll get what he wants AFTER he does what you ask.    take training a recall, for example. to train it reliably, you can't call the dog and then leash him up and leave every time he listens. that means play time is over.  you call him, treat and praise him, and turn him loose to get back to his play. the pup learns that it's a minor interruption, and not the end of play time.   make sure you are integrating his training with play, this will make it more fun, that's important because he's a baby. don't do too much intensive drill type training yet, he'll just get bored of it. working commands into fetch sessions are great because after he sits, you throw the ball! yay! (this also trains the pup to wait and be patient for something he wants, instead of trying to knock you down for it!)    just keep going the way you are.... sounds like you are doing well so far!  good luck to you and your pup!    (for a good training reference for pups, try Leerburg.com. ed frawley has great advice on training well trained, well rounded pups.|`|OxFsslN8aa	When you know you are going to be somewhere and your dog will be distracted (ie park or with visitors) then have him on a leash.  When you give a command, give it once & then jerk the leash to get his attention.  If he doesn't react appropriately to the command on his own, you need to bring him to you and make him perform the command.  If you allow him to ignore you once, you are setting him up to ignore you whenever he feels like it.  The leash will help him to comply.|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	Your idea is right. The only way to increase the chances that he will respond when distracted is to practice often and reward heavily. At this point you should start to practice around mild distractions in a controlled way. For instance, you can have a friend approach you on the street. Call your pup to come to you. If he doesn't, your friend can stop walking until you get your pup to you. Repeat until he readily comes to you several times. Once he does, up the distraction a bit (your friend walks faster or is closer when you call your pup or is talking to the pup).
KPdWzbxWaa	That is pretty normal for a pup. My dog had the same issue when he was a puppy. So what I did was put a bell on the door, and made him touch his nose to it every time before we went outside. After a couple days of consistently doing that, he started to ring the bell himself, to let me know he needed to go out. It really helped me out, because I found a way for him to tell me. You can also try using a schedule of taking him out ever 30min. I know its a lot of work, but eventually he will get the hang out it. Also, give him a special treat that he only gets if he goes potty outside. Make sure its something he really likes :). Hot dogs and cheese work well.    Good luck with your pup :)|`|AA11992723	he's only 8 weeks old, take him out every 2-3 hours. for every month older he gets, extend the wait time by 1 hour before he goes out again. but right now, even if he pooped outside don't count on no accidents ever if you dont take him out every few hours and after he eats, plays vigorously and sleeps.|`|AA12128656	right now he's like an 18 month old baby. pee just happens more often... expect him to need to go often, and not to know about it.   get him on a schedule, and stick to it. this way, he'll be more predictable. always take him out after waking, eating, or playing. then take him out about every hour or so as well.  as time goes by, his habits will become more ingrained, so he'll be more predictable.  and clean up the pee (even on tile!) with a good enzyme cleaner like Nature's Miracle.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	The bladder isn't grown until 6-months-old, and they are not fully potty trained until 1-year, so hang in there.  Here are some tips, use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like tsst and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop..  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they dont know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you dont want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.       REVISIONS:    *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you.   *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place.   *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.   *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.    *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying go finish until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesnt sneak off, or for strange places.   *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.

Our German Sheppard will go twice in a matter of a few minutes, so yours may not be fully done and ready to come back inside.

A puppy so young has almost no muscle yet to hold in the water works, try shortening the the times in between trips outside, pay close attention to his water intake and look for signs that your puppy is looking for a good place to "go." Nosing around is the most obvious, when it looks like he or she is searching for something, even if its probably an interesting smell, better to be safe than sorry-take him out.    If your having the problem that you have to go to work and when you get home theres accidents, you should probably ask someone to let the dog out at least once if not twice.     If your having accidents at night, and your not kennel training, set an alarm, a puppy is just like a new baby you have to get up during the night.     Also have a bowl of treats by the door and always praise your puppy "good potty" eventually your dog with learn the command and you will be able to tell him to go potty and he'll know what you want when he goes out.    Petco Puppy Taining classes, $100/6 classes, also go to your local Petco and ask about "Free seminars" they sometimes have potty taining seminars you can attend for free as well as other helpful information.

SnAsZapMaa	(1) Snobbery - many machos think that it sounds "classier" to command their dog in a foreign language.  (2) Necessity/Speed - in theory, humans are more intelligent & mentally flexible than are dogs, so people who import a pre-trained dog can learn the German or Dutch or Czech command words it is used to quicker than their new dog can learn the English command words.    The actual words used by an owner-trained dog are totally irrelevant - the dog should heed ONLY the sounds & signals its owner-trainer and the owner's family make. But some words are easier than others for imparting the particular tone required - obvious examples being the sounds used to calm a dog, vs those used to heighten its excitement.    The exception to that owner+family requirement are dogs trained for multiple handlers, as with many security patrol dogs, whether they be military dogs or those guarding a closed enclave.    However, despite certain words being traditional for commanding particular actions, ANY word can be used for anything. Old timers might have seen a circus that featured a "perverse" dog - when told to sit, the dog would lie down or stand; when told to stand it would lie down or sit; when told to come it would go away; when the clown angrily called it all sorts of rude names for "disobeying" it would prance & happily wag its tail; when the clown cajoled it with honeyed   tones it would cringe in fear.

I know 2. :-)|`|tDUPkdgUaa	they use a different language because they dont need the dog to get confused by anyone else.    suppose you're a crook and you're being chased by police and their K9-Units. if they used english words to train the dog, you can easily tell the dog "Sit! Stay!" and the GSD will obey and will sit and stay. then you'll be homefree.    now since they use the german language, the dogs wont know what you mean by "Sit! Stay!" because those words arent used to train him. therefore, you're a sitting duck.      but not all of them are trained with the german language because my cousins boyfriend is a cop. hes got a K9-Unit that he brings home and the dog is house trained with english words, but is on-the-job trained with a series of unique whistles.    :]|`|iJtuhLMTaa	Not all are they may be trained in various languages with German and Dutch being the most common.  On of the purposes of training them in a foreign language is so their handler can command them without the majority of people knowing what they are commanding.  It also helps to prevent other people trying to command the dog.  Most are trained to only respond to command from their handler and maybe one or 2 others but the commands in a foreign language help to avoid confusion|`|Z0v6G0Kgaa	You could Latin or Quechua or Basque.  The idea is to use words that the public (and especially a perpetrator) isn't likely to understand or get or guess.  And by the way, increasingly K9 dogs now are Belgian Malinois (not GSDs) but to the uneducated public they look the same.    I know someone who has trained her terrier to bark.  Her command to the terrier is "no bite."  That way, if someone is approaching that she wants to deter, she'll say "no bite" loudly and the dog begins barking (like a mean, take-no-prisoners kind of dog).  No-one would suspect she ordered the dog to bark as a deterent (because she didn't say "bark" or "speak").  Well, that's the same with using German or any other key word.  You come up with something that other people aren't likely to be able to know or guess.    The only other reason why some GSDs get taught German commands is that Schutzhund is very popular for large working breeds and classical schutzhund trainers may still use German words.|`|AQIF3qIbaa	They use german commands to train their dogs because it will help eliminate interference by other people.  If a bad guy tries to tell the dog to lay down or be quiet, etc, it won't matter.  None of the typical english commands are in the dogs vocabulary, and so he won't be deterred.|`|q7GBzr6yaa	GERMAN  shepherd|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Not all German Shepherds are trained in German.  Most times they are given a key word to do something (in German) that most other people wouldn't know.  Their 'attack' word or 'stop attacking' word may be in German, but the basic commands would still be in English.    Not only "police dogs" are trained to respond to other languages. Some people just want their dogs to respond only to them so they give them alternative words or languages for every day commands.|`|jZ7ImGbvaa	Dogs from Europe are often given commands in their native language (Breston's commands are all in Dutch). Many people think this is so no one besides the handler can accidentally give them an "attack" command in English. This is a myth. The real reason is much simpler -- the dogs were trained with those command words, and it's much easier for the officer to learn a few Dutch or German words than to retrain the dog with new commands.     A police dog must also make it through endurance and agility training. The dog must be able to jump over walls and climb stairs. Each dog is acclimated to city life, because a dog that's nervous around people won't make a good police dog.     Finally, each dog receives specialty training. Many dogs are trained to search for drugs, though some are bomb or gun sniffers. Police dogs can also track missing persons or suspects.     In the next section, you'll learn about the specialty training that produces a dog able to locate illegal drugs.|`|Xa9esMTEaa	Most police dogs were imported as adults from Europe and are already trained in their native language. Dog's from Slovakia are trained in Slovak, dogs from Germany are trained in German, and dogs from the Netherlands are trained in Dutch...their American police dog handlers usually learn their native commands instead of retraining the dog on new commands. As some have said, it's also so people don't know what you're commanding or what commands mean but it's not a huge part of why because anybody can look up the 6 or 7 common obedience commands in German are (sit, stay, heel, bite, and so forth).    Uhhh to the british gentleman...every police dog trained in German knows Bleib means "Stay", and every police dog trained in Slovak knows Stuy means stay. In England a lot of police dogs are trained in English because you have the crappiest police dogs in the World. You guys take regular "pet quality" dogs and try to turn them into police dogs. You also use a lot of German show dogs (which aren't much better than out of the paper pet quality AKC/KC show German Shepherds). I've seen a British Police dog who was sent after a criminal run circles around the criminal and hop in the car with the criminal who probably took him home as a pet/trophy to show his degenerate friends. You don't know German commands because you guys don't use fine German working line dogs...Mexico has better K9 units than the UK...now that's sad!|`|gxzJ4lxhaa	I trained and handled German Shepherd Police dogs for many years. I only once came across a German word of command (Platz), for lie down and it was only used by one officer. The words of command which number around eighteen, as that is the accepted number a dog can assimilate, with some exceptions are most commonly. "Stand","Sit" "Down", which are self explanitary. "Find Him", used in searching for people, good or bad. "Fetch", used to retrieve an article thrown for the dog, or an article that has been hidden or lost. "Come" for recall, "Stop Him", used to chase and apprehend a fleeing person. "Heel" the command for the dog to walk at your side, on or off the lead. "Leave" to require the dog to release whatever he has taken possession of.There are many others but these were and are still the basic ones.Contrary to popular belief dogs do not understand foreign languages, but sounds. There is no such command as "Stay", ie. if you tell the dog to sit, that is what he is required to do until you tell him or her to do something else.|`|WIFKeDBgaa	Language doesn't really matter...no well trained dog is gonna listen to anyone but their handler. Most of the dogs purchased have already started competing in schutzhund. As a courtesy to the judges, everyone speaks German. A bring in dogs from all over...within a few days, they understand and work with the German commands.    And yes....there are a LOT of malanois now.....the majority of them are speaking French.
Tsjy6fu2aa	Haha. Our Great Dane Does that too! He squats instead of lifting his leg, so he pees all over his front paws. No solution, except help him...Or maybe wash off his legs after he's done?|`|Mzvp1LPFaa	Some dogs just do that because of anatomy - they aren't long enough in the body to miss their feet and/or the backs of their front legs.  If you go the next large dog show, they sell waterproof sleeves that are designed to fit on a dog's front legs and protect them from exactly that. When the exhibitor is ready to go into the ring, the sleeves come off - no urine stained fur!  Show supply catalogs would also have it.|`|q7GBzr6yaa	as he pees hold his winky!|`|7bSvI2IUaa	He likes the smell of it|`|L22hVXTIaa	I have that problem with one of my Chis.  When he lifts his leg, he lifts it so high that his body is turned sideways and he usually get some on his front paw.  We live in a very rural area with coyotes, fox, and the occasional Mountain Lion, so we always go out with out little guys.  So, whenever I see him hit his front foot, I have to clean him up when he comes back in.  It's a hassle, and I don't know how to fix this one.|`|PVMsr2Faaa	I have the same problem only I am potty trained.|`|NEH7JWNMaa	He just thinks it's raining, or he's hung like a horse!
3K2H4zB4aa	Pit bull's markings stay the same, however as he gets bigger the spot may get bigger also.|`|PdaiyUkDaa	not  by  much  mine is  2 and still loks the same as she did as a puppy|`|BVzJqvxvaa	no they will look the same, just bigger|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Most breeds coats change color until they are 18-months-old.|`|tDUPkdgUaa	depending on how big the spot is, depends on how visible the spot will be as he gets older. some dogs tend to shed little spots and some tend to gain. my Rat Terrier was golden-yellow and white when we first got her. but as she got older the golden-yellow became just yellow and wasnt as golden as before.    so... if the spot is the size of a quarter or bigger, then chances are, he'll still have it when he gets bigger. if not, there shouldnt be too much of a vision on the spot when he gets older.    i think a random spot on a solid colored dog is adorable, btw.    :]
An2AopAqaa	First of all, breast feeding pigs. Baby pigs are born with eyes open and all the claws and teeth fully functional. I have bred pigs in the past and known the babies to eat fruit and veg on the day they are born. I used to give them readybrek mixed with warm water too, they loved this!     Guinea pigs can leave their mum's about 6 weeks of age but can sometimes begin breeding from as young as four weeks so males can be removed early if necessary.    About the death. It's possible rats could have done it but I doubt they'd kill baby and not mum.     Mummy may have killed her if she sees her as a threat to her unborn babies, she might have thought there wasn't enough food to feed all of them. Pile loads of veggies in, wild ones if you like because I know they don't come cheap!     And make sure she has a nest full of hay/straw (hay is better but she'll eat it) so full she has to chew her way in. Cover the cage at night with a carpet for thick blanket so the cold doesn't get in; it's not the best time of weather to be breeding piggies.     [:|`|Zm9NNCHXaa	OMG the poor guinea pig!!|`|3sB49YNnaa	I cannot imagine the sow doing it.  In over 40 years of raising guinea pigs I have never seen that kind of damage caused by one guinea pig to another nor have I ever seen a mother kill one of he pups.    Guinea pigs nurse anywheres from a week to 3 weeks.  They are eating solid food within 12-24 hours and are pretty self sufficient by about a week even if they are still nursing.    They should be weaned by 3 weeks at the latest and the males separated from the females.  The sow will probably have weaned the pups by 3 weeks in any case.  You can leave the female and her female pups together forever but it is for company not nutrition!|`|CvLwS9p5aa	they are probably very territorial guinea-pigs, apparently it happen a lot with hamsters and stuffs.if they have to share a hutch or whatever, they often fight over the best laces to sleep, the best food, or even attention.|`|j4JpA35Qaa	I dont know exactly why this happens but the same thing happend with my dwarf hamsters.I was told that if one is sick the other will kill it
XK9RLaPeaa	Keep exercising her a lot. She needs to be trained, and she would probably enjoy the one on one time with you and the mental stimulation that training provides. Find an experienced trainer that uses positive reinforcement methods. The dog will be a real handful if she isnt trained. If you would like to learn how to do the training yourself, I would recommend the clicker training method. It works great, and the dog really enjoys learning, instead of some traditional ways of being taught through fear. www.clickerlessons.com You have to know the science behind it though, or it wont work (so read the entire thing). Good Luck!
FdcWPp48aa	If this is your parents house they need to lay down the rules to your brother.  They are at risk of a lawsuit if anyone were to be harmed by Max because they allow Max to live at their house.  Sad for Max, but sounds like he should be put down.  Since your brother would probably never know the difference, take Max and have him neutered yourself.|`|YWUjeTnUaa	Your brother dropped off the dog leaving all care to you. Since he is esentially your dog now, get him neutered too. This may help on the agression. Honestly you do need to train that out of the dog since you may be the one legally responsible if he does bite.|`|GSf09ALBaa	You have 2 intact males.  You have at least one (your brother's dog) who has no obedience training and it obviously out of control.  There is no way you are going to be able to prevent anything with Max because he is very unbalanced.  He needs to be neutered and have serious training done by a professional because it is obvious your brother does not know how to do it.  I feel sorry for the dog because he has spent most of his life on a chain which to me is abusive.      None of this is the dog's fault.  And why do you still have the dog after a month?  Are you keeping the dog?  Is he going to take the dog back?    Sounds to me like you have been doggy dumped.  If that is the case you will have to take control of this situation.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	Ummm, where are your parents in all this? Also, if you want the dog not to attack scrappy when you go out, give him some attention first as he clearly is begging for it. If you are worried about scrappy, divide the yard.|`|RDQittNDaa	Tell your brother that it's your place and to take his stupid dog somewhere else.  If he doesn't like it, then kick them all out.  You shouldn't have to put up with your brother's dumb dog if it's your place...which is what it sounds like.|`|q7GBzr6yaa	call animal control you can get suid, and fined for a mean dog! Both dogs will get taken. Poor Max is tied too a chain thats horrible|`|asEeCmzraa	I know it's your brother's dog, but as far as I'm concerned, the dog needs neutering and training. Tell your brother that he either gets the dog neutered and trained, or you will. If the dog is living on your property, and has become a threat to your dog, then your brother needs to rectify that problem. If your brother won't give in, then maybe it's time for an ultimatum- Fix the problem, or find the dog somewhere else to live. It is not worth the stress to you or your pet to have an aggressive dog on the property.|`|L22hVXTIaa	First of all, Max should not be allowed to come to your house anymore.......period.  If he should bite someone, you will probably be on the hook since you are care taking the dog.  Secondly, Max is attacking your dog!  That has to stop.  How will you feel if Max should do real damage to your dog?!  If your brother is not taking responsibility for his own dog, you should not have to do so.  Max's problems stem from an irresponsible owner, living his life on a chain and being un-neutered.  He will only get worse as he gets older.  Tell your brother that Max is no longer welcome in your home - you might also suggest to him that he try to re-home Max to someone who will properly train and care for the dog.
DU0F48B3aa	First let me say this is not normal  This could be a number of things as simple as worms or as bad as cancer.  Teh best thing is take your dog to the vets and have a thorough checkup.   if you worm get a stool sample done and wormer froma vet the over teh conter is nothing but junk|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	Ever heard of the word VET???|`|q7GBzr6yaa	Have him wormed!|`|BiHbT9pTaa	That's obviously not normal.  I would take him to your veterinarian immediatly!|`|2JIb5Bkoaa	Classic signs of Tape Worm.    It can be life threatening, so I urge you to take her to a vet!    I LOVE American Staff Terriers - even in a mix - they are so lovable!|`|3HSNFDaJaa	Probably got worms, if she's not been treated recently then do it.If she has or it does not work go to a vet.
vMXk9ohSaa	Breed - American Shorthair.   Coloring - Tabby.     The most common type cat in the country.  I have one just like him except some white under his chin.  There's a neighborhood cat that walks by outside our window that looks just like him.  Mine is freaked out watching him walk by.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Well a bit hard to tell the colour since for whatever you edited it to black and white.  This kitten is a cat of no particular breed - just like over 97% of the cats on this entire planet.  If the base colour is brown then its colour is Brown Mackerel Tabby.  If it's a dark gray then it'd be Blue Mackerel Tabby.    Carol is wrong.  The most common cat is not the American Shorthair - that's a specific breed of pedigreed cat.  The most common cat is the DOMESTIC shorthair aka a cat of no particular breed.
KLwuOu0qaa	You will have to introduce them slowly. i am sure there is going to be a little jealousy but they get over it quick|`|iwNYcerfaa	you should probably wait until she has passed on before you bring another dog into the household. However, if you must bring another dog into the home, you need to make sure they get along before you commit to two dogs that hate eachother. You need to have them meet on neutral territory, meaning a place where neither dog has claimed. Someone elses' backyard. etc. Also you need to keep both leashes loose, if they are tight it will cause the dogs to be more aggressive and lunge. You may want to keep a spray bottle filled with water close by for corrections and you're going to need someone else with you to help control. Let your 1st dog snap and bite the puppy,not aggressively but if she is just nipping him let her. You're puppy will learn to respect her space.|`|DAg1Hejmaa	hold the puppy to the lab.  see how and if they bond.  usually Labs are terriffic with puppies, if they don't bond immediately then little by little day by day introduce them.  As far as territorial the lab will let the beagle know whats his,  allow that as long as he doesn't hurt him of which i doubt  remember to give love evenly to both dogs.
6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	I leave a plug-in night light on in the hallway, so that I can see where I'm going, and my cats have enough light to see to make it to their litter boxes..      Cats can NOT see in ABSOLUTE blackness, but a nightlight works just fine.  It gives them just enough light, and keeps ME from running OVER them when I'm up.    This works for me.........Hope it helps you.......|`|w1lh1INHaa	Cats have incredible night vision (about 10 times stronger than night vision goggles).  They need less th an 5 lumens to see as clearly as humans do in daylight.  In today's world of ambient light, there is no such thing as "pitch black," particularly to a cat!    Is the kitchen downstairs?  I suspect she is following you down in anticipation of a midnight snack and doesn't follow you back up because she is waiting for you to proffer up that snack.|`|YvZKd1ycaa	cats can see just as well in the dark as in the light, however, if she's getting old, she may just be having vision problems in general|`|iU2fQBtRaa	Why not wait for her or carry her up? She might follow you to go outside or to have some food also.
L3j2HrsJaa	Sorry:(  hope it lives too.  Ok, I'll say a little prayer:)    edited: How is your fishie?|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Why don't you ask how you can make the fish better?|`|AraBfesHaa	What kind of fish?  What size of container or tank is it in?  Is it at the right temperature?  Did you check for ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels?  Does it have an air bubbler to put oxygen in it's tank (container)?  Does it have anything (marks, sores etc) on it that shouldn't be there?  Did you condition the water to get rid of the chlorine?    If you can answer these questions, all or any of us can probably tell  you how you can help keep it alive.    We can pray for it, but it still needs your help too.|`|q0vKbocHaa	this isn't really a question....    If he is floating and such, put a boiled pea in the bowl, it will help|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Okay|`|naijqNojaa	ohhh so sad  i hope he gets better
hCyt28Meaa	Yes, your fish should be alive in the morning, they are cold-water fish, so heating isn't a problem, oxygen levels could be low, but it should be ok. Change a tiny bit of the water every day and make sure you use water conditioner. Try to get your tank up and running soon, and in the mean time, a big pot or tupperware container would make a nice home for the fish. It would be a little more spacious then the ragu jar. Good luck, happy fish keeping =]|`|e9gXZsKxaa	He will be fine for  a day or two but as soon as you can get him a bigger tank, he'll be much happier. Black moors need like 30 gallon tanks alone and an additional 20 for another.|`|fOT0lRqhaa	you need at least a 10 gallon tank with a filter and an airpump to keep it alive and heather is not neaded|`|gGvci7SDaa	Take it out of the ragu jar, and put it into anything with a lid, that will allow it to swim...  That fish will die by the morning, either from suffocation or from toxic water.    I don't mean to be a downer, but your fish needs more room, more water, and as soon as it can enter the tank, do it.    I hope this helps!|`|wD9sdGhZaa	Ragu Jar?  At least put it in a large bowl for the time being.  Ragu jar's pretty small.|`|YfrlbQ3naa	I wonder if u are able to aerate the water?? That is what your fish needs plus room to move around.  Until ur tank is fixed put him into the biggest container that u can run a pump into.  Something that can handle a aerated stone would even do, but without proper oxygen it will not survive.  Hurry with the real tank!!
YqVtOSWwaa	It is absolutely alright. Wonderful, in fact. Rats have been shown to live in better harmony in threesomes as opposed to pairs. I have no clue what that other guy is talking about, but clearly, neither does he. Rats are extremely social, and get along happily in large numbers. Go ahead and snatch that ratty up :) But first:    1. Ensure your cage is large enough to comfortably house 3 rats. (http://www.rattycorner.com/odds/calc.sht...    2. Learn about the importance of quarantine periods. This lasts minimum 2 weeks, and can spare you 3 expensive vet bills if you just keep the new guy apart. Read more here:  http://www.rmca.org/Articles/dosanddonts...  http://ratguide.com/health/basics/quaran...    3. Leave at least a week of slow introductions on neutral territory at first. Let them play on your bed or bath tub before leaving them in their own cages together. Sticking them in like this will lead to serious and bloody fighting. They need time to get used to each other out side the cage first. More on introductions:  http://www.petratscanada.com/ratcare.htm (under socialization)|`|93b0c00df64653217aaa6a71ea6b0b74aa	No, not all right, male rats are extremely aggressive so if you put three in the same cage not only will they fight each other more than likely one will end up dead. As much as you want another hairless rat either put it in it's own cage or don't get him.|`|Cj5t4vfDaa	DO NOT ADD ANOTHER MALE. they will attack each other as they were not litter mates. you can only add males with each other if they are from the same litter and if they aren't they have to be under 5 weeks old or they will fight.
e9gXZsKxaa	Fish food does expire. I'm not sure about the water conditioner and medications, I'm sure it last longer than the food though.|`|qEp9fxU9aa	Food items do expire, medicine expires though the chemical that takes care of chlorine lasts several years with no problems.  If you plan on getting fish again or setting up your aquarium within the next few months than take the fish food, put it in a plastic freezer bag and put it in the freezer.  It will stay good for a longer time this way.  I hope you get back in the hobby and have some success.  The number one reason fish die is that people don't bother doing basic maintenance like water changes at least once every other week.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Fish food usually has a packaged date. One or two years then you want to throw it out.    Im not sure about the medicines.|`|NBfBKI1Uaa	Many of the fish product you mention doesn't have an expiration date if kept properly.    Liquid tests bottle can go bad if the bottle is not kept in properly. For example, leaving the bottle open will allow oxygen to react with liquid and contaminate the test liquid.     Same with solid trip tests. After will they will oxidize with oxygen in the air.    Medicine is also similar to the liquid tests bottle. If not kept properly willt also be contaminated and make it useless.    Food on other hand is dry processed and should be able to keep for long time without going bad.    -rds|`|iOuTyHDWaa	Testing supplies will degrade over time to the point where they are inaccurate. Case in point...I drop tested for ammonia/nitrates/ites before adding some fish to my aquarium. 2 days later, one of the new fish died...took him to the fish store to discuss it with a sample of water....they tested the water and all of what I had tested to nil were high as a kite...and the fish already in my tank were "used" to it and had to do some water changes to stabilize the tank again and now all the fish are happy!    So...testing supplies will go bad after about a year. Flake foods are a bit more giving...because they are dehydrated.|`|AraBfesHaa	Yes medications and conditioners etc. do expire.  Just check the label (on a bottle, usually in the back, if it's in a box it is usually on the back of the box or the bottom.  If you don't see an expiration date, I would think it doesn't go bad.  Alot of the things you're talking about have a website address on them somewhere, so if you're skeptical about using them, just use their contact link on their site and ask them.

dO0cb4yBaa	The key thing is to do your research before you go talk to your parents. This demonstrates your dedication and willingness to learn and care for a new pet. You can go to your local library to get some good resources or just use the internet. There are a lot of great resources on the internet. I've included a couple resources below to get you started. Also check out the links to other resources on my links page - http://www.infosuperflyway.com/links.php    Good luck :)|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	dont get a bird for a pet, birds are nasty when you have to live with them...|`|vMByDy1raa	FIrst do your research and make sure a bird is really what you want.  Then you need to make sure you show you are responsible enough.  Example (clean room) (help with chores around the house), (keep homework up),  and lastly after you decide what type of bird you want make a budget.  The cost of bird, cage, perches and toys and don't forget vet visit.  Then you need to save money, most parent like me will say if you pay half I'll pay half.  If you are not doing you chores around the house without being reminded, try that and show them how much the bird means to you.  Parents want to do things to make you happy but whining and crying isn't going to get anything accomplished.  Empower yourself and show your parents what a  responsible young person you can be.|`|FGn8okQQaa	First you have to decide what species you're interested in.  You can't just get "a bird"; the different species have different needs, lifespans, sizes, and noise levels.  Then you'll have to do tons of research to see if your family is really right for whatever bird you're interested in.  You also have to find an avian vet that's a reasonable distance away.  If your parents have any sense of responsibility, they will not let you get a pet they're not prepared for or that won't get a ride to the vet whenever it needs medical attention.|`|2YIxnXXyaa	Birds are messy and loud.  They'll annoy you and your family to insanity if they don't want one.  Get a small one, tell them it'll be in your room, you'll take care of it and buy everything for it.  Persuade them for a long time, it took me years to be allowed to get a bird, and I only got one because we caught a Budgie.  She was great, but mean.  Get a baby one.  Tell them you'll train it so it'll be nice.  That's the best thing I can think of..and I'm a great persuader haha.  Good luck to you.|`|tvSG1diNaa	First of all any pet is a big responsibility. Tell yourself if you are ready to commit to cleaning and giving your pet bird attention. Make sure no one is allergic to birds. They can carry mites. Birds are very messy and loud, but depends on the breed or size you wish to choose. Also birds can live for a very long time. Do some research online about different breeds with your parents and see what they think. You have to let them know you are mature and responsible enough to take care of it.

VWvI5RyBaa	Dogs need a lot of attention.  Some can even suffer from anxiety attacks when their owner leaves to go to work or elsewhere.  It's not the same for all dogs though.  I have a dog that is part terrier and he used to dig huge holes in the backyard(we have a fence) when we were going away.  He got used to it though and is much better.  It seems that some dogs never get used to being alone however and the veterinarians have some kind of medications for those cases.|`|gjC2TB0zaa	My dog would be beyond happy if I gave him attention 24 hours a day.

ZGLbVjgTaa	in our culture, we do believe that when our dogs howl like crying humans, they could see some spirits or ghosts walking or just visiting your house. so if you heard your dog trying to speak-cry stop it because he is saying that one of your relatives would die because some dead relatives wanna get another relative and so.    my aunt use to say, get a cat it will protect you from the devil.  she also added this story. if a devil come to visit you, the cat will block him away. for the devil to get through, he must first cut the cat's tail, but the cat always move his tails (try observing) so the devil wont take a chance then leave and never come after you.    and also, my other aunt said, if you get some "muta", the gummy reaction of our eyes, including cats and dogs. and place it into your eye, you could see ghosts.. but none of us did this, no one still dares.    what i told you is just a passed-on story on our culture. it may be true but who knows if it's made up or could be hell true|`|vvJBtxXHaa	cats and dogs sense lower as well as higher ranges of sound, vibration and tastes  whether the etherial essence emits some sound or vibration is not well understood, however some thermal differences are inexplicably associated with possibly ghost-type existence  ...the change in temperature and sense of movement is commonly known by most all cats and some dogs  i personally believe the sense of hearing, and sensitive whiskers enable the cats in particular to notice the movement of ectoplasmic movement/presence|`|WWIpMRsgaa	This would be hard to answer because we are not really sure What dogs or cats really see. We only have ideas from what we can extrapulate from what we know about our own eyes and what we can see when we disect their eyes.     However, it is not hard//factual evidence that ghosts even exist.     Basically, ghosts may not exist at which point dogs wouldn't be able to see them.

om4Szik7aa	Well, the female has to show signs of being ready to breed. You should be able to see her breeding tube sticking out on her belly. If she is not doing this, she is not ready.  You should try putting them in separate tanks, but next to each other so they can see each other. Let him then build his bubble nest, until you see her tube coming out, then float her in the tank in a see through container.  Let her in after a few hours, and see how the male tolerates her. You should take her out if he beats on her too much. You will tell when they begin to breed as they cradle each other. Once he begins to chase her way after the breeding is done, carefully remove the female.|`|DF6ihDDCaa	Move her from the boys.   They'll probably kill her.

YnCUyvK7aa	Fertility will peak and drop off, but if you have other fish, the eggs could be getting eaten.  So either, or both, could be happening.    It would have been helpful to know what kinds of fish you have and how long you've had them.    ADDED  Glofish are genetically modified zebra danios, so even though they're different colors, they're all the same species.  These will live for 3-5 years, and at 1-2 years old, they age yours probably are, they will still be able to lay eggs.  So I'd go with the idea of the others eating them.
0OyGno5Eaa	i would say that's a nice set-up, but would lose the red tailed shark as they can become very aggressive once matured, i would also up your neon's and glolights to 10, and make sure you have bog wood in the tank for the plec as they need it in their diet,and fresh veggies for it to eat too. so i would say     6 male platy  5 male guppies  10 neon tetra  10 glolight tetra  1 bristlenose plec (as long as its dietary needs can be met)|`|JvTF7UrMaa	yeah thats a beautiful set up xxx dont get rid of the shark unless he gets 2 big every fish has a different personality xxx|`|gHKJmygoaa	no, just watch for aggression from the red tail or the bristlenose.    Provide lots of foliage for for the red tail to hide in/break up his territory.     for the bristlenose make sure there at at least two caves that will be large enough to fit a 6 inch bristlenose [his adult size] because they prefer to hide.    Glolight tetras are non existent. Neon tetras and jumbo neons are the same thing. Glofish are biologically altered danios.|`|QyP0hDkJaa	Yeah that sounds perfect although maybe add some female platys, also guppys can be slightly fin nipping so watch out for that.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	That looks good to me. You have got the room to increase the Neon's and Glolights to ten.     As long as the Shark is growing up in there it should be OK, the only fish it's not going to like is the Bristlenose, but there's plenty of floor space and as long as it has a cave to hide in it will just be handbags at dawn.|`|91Yhm4Xjaa	yeah i agree dont rid the shark...as long as he has his own territiory he will hopefully leave the others alone...if he does start to get aggressive you may have to move him on to another tank    but other than that...nice set up|`|tMlwcim8aa	Everything is good, except for the Red Tail Shark. Red-tailed black sharks have incredible colors and can easily become the centerpiece of any aquarium. These fish are territorial and hostile. They can be kept in community tanks with care. They are also very intolerant of others in their species or similar species in general. However, many of the cyprinid sharks, including the Red-Tail, can be kept in groups if the aquarium is very large, there are plenty of hiding places in the aquarium, and three or more individuals are purchased at a time. Nonetheless, many of the so-called "sharks" are best left to more experienced aquarists. Red-tailed black sharks can reach a length of 30", and can live up to the age of 15 years.     Other than that, you have a good setup going, just put the Shark in a different tank.|`|dbZvPW3Haa	Nice, however you may start losing your tetras overnight, my red tailed shark was looking stunning he was snacking on the tetra's at night time and very territorial.

WxwrWnubaa	Signs that your hamster is pregnant: She will build a large nest and hoard food in it.  And, she will stop coming into heat.  Around day 10 of pregnancy, her belly will be larger and her nipples may be more prominent.    A male and female dwarf hamster pair can produce a *lot* of offspring, as they will mate again soon after she gives birth.  If you don't want any more litters, put the male in another cage before she gives birth.      For more info  http://www.petwebsite.com/

AA12083992	the first thing to remember about house training a puppy is there ability to hold themselves is limited. a rule of thumb is they can hold "it" usually 1 hour for each month of age. 2 months old = 2 hours, 3 months old = 3 hours, etc. when your puppy wakes up (morning, nap, whatever) the pup has to go, right then! take the pup out. when the pup eats or drinks, it has to go, take the pup out. after exercise (play), take the pup out. when the pup does it's thing outside praise it. a lot. tell the pup how good, how smart it is.  you have to pay attention to the pups "looking for it's spot" behavior. when you see that behavior indoors, whisk the pup out. if you catch the pup in the act, simply tell it "NO!" and whisk it outside. if you find a puddle or pile after the fact, clean it up with an enzyme cleaner (pet food store) get a newspaper and hit.... yourself in the head and say "i should have been paying more attention" daytime training they get pretty fast. night time training is easier if you crate train the pup. also remember the one hour/one month rule. you will have to get up through the night to take the pup out. good luck    three websites on how to crate train a puppy  http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~rc207100/info...          http://www.inch.com/~dogs/cratetraining....       http://www.planeturine.com/pettips/dsp_c...|`|87cf5a54ce94b92fe70448969fcfaf5eaa	Teach him specific commands that expect him to do his business as told (like "wheewhee" for no.1 and "poopoo" for no.2). Say it everytime he does his business so he learns to associate the word with the action. Then, find a designated place where you want him to do his business (on a newspaper, a certain spot in your backyard, etc.) and bring him there everytime he starts doing his business. Don't forget to tell him the commands while he's doing it and praise him when he's done. The pup should learn it within a few weeks at most.|`|AA12391057	Spend as much time with this puppy asa you can!!! I had a 4 week old collie/shelite mix and she was potty trained in a week and she only pooped in the house once!!! I was so proud of her!! But keep a good eye on when she gets a drink and take her outside about twenty minutes after that no matter if she whines or not and same with eatting. When she gets up from a nap take her potty! Tell you what its easier then what you think! Good Luck!!|`|0ec4b1846c6e9ec9b0622a920a184d4eaa	Bottom line is to take the puppy outside to pee every 2 hours (if 2 months old), and within 10 minutes after every meal, and right before you go to bed at night and when you get up in the AM. Praise him when he pees outside. If he has an accident, don't punish him. Show it to him and say "no" and put him right outside.

Los perros pueden venir, por naturaleza, como los seres humanos, equilibrados o no. La prueba est en, por ejemplo, la fama de los dobermann, que han sido creados especialmente para atacar gente. Yo tengo una dobermann y dos amigas mas tambin. Si bien tienen el carcter nervioso e inquieto (imparable!) de la raza, son perros tan buenos y afectuosos como falderos, sin dejar de ser guardianes.  Conozco San Bernardos que son agresivos cuando en realidad son famosos por su benevolencia. El Rotweiller es conocido por su carcter especial, de cuidado, pero criado con amor se limita a ser duro a la hora de la guardia, en la casa es un juguete de los chicos. Lo mismo para los dogos.  En cambio he sido mordida y muy lastimada por un peque?simo y traicionero pincher de quien luego me entero que era muy maltratado en la casa.

1i8HiHHeaa	there are many tick borne diseases that can infect dogs. the usual course of treatment is (at least) 3 weeks of antibiotics. be glad you caught it in time & your dog is now receiving treatment. there is some controversy as to whether the dog will be 'cured' or the disease simply goes dormant.     if you live in a tick infested area it is always advisable to be sure to get veterinary attention at the first signs of the disease as some of them have a poor prognosis with subsequent episodes of illness.     i have two dogs who have suffered from anaplasmosis. i found a couple of ticks on one (he was asymptomatic) & none on the other (i almost lost her). they were both on frontline at the time. even with a preventive like that the tick can still attach for up to 48 hours before it is killed. that is ample time to transmit any one of a number of nasty diseases. be sure to be vigilant in the future & do thorough examinations of your dogs after they've been outside.|`|veDvtYhJaa	google "tick fever"  call your vet and ASK YOUR VET!

There are so many but I actually found researching interesting.  There are dog foods that have been known to cause kidney and bladder problems. Ask your vet what exactly it is in dog food that you should avoid for him. What is it that can cause kidney problems.   Then you can check the ingredients and find one that doesn't contain whatever that is.  I think I rambled on here but I hope you can understanad what I mean.
bDPVRtCNaa	I would first like to say please do not go with goldfish. They grow much too large for your tank, and are massive waste producers. They require 20-55 gallons minimum depending on the variety.    Also, cycling with fish as one person suggested it not necessary and considered by some as cruel. You can do a fishless cycle by running the tank for at least a week and adding a source of ammonia like fish food to mimic fish waste.    Your only options for a ten gallon aquarium are tropical fish (tropical means warmer water, not marine). So you would need a small heater for your aquarium, and if I can make a suggestion, the Marineland Stealth Heater is a very reliable.    For a ten gallon tank I would choose:  -One male Betta, and a a few African dwarf frogs.  -One male Betta and a school of rasboras.   -One dwarf gourami and a school of small tetras like neons.    Schooling fish like tetras should be kept in groups of at least six.|`|LCIcUTwNaa	Goldfish,fantailed guppies,mollies,tetras.About3 of each.See how that goes.|`|AOBEkqzXaa	I think for a 10-gallon tank your max would be about 4 fish|`|UiQ6V377aa	Take a trip to the pet store and look at their selection.

There are many colors to chose from. For a 10 gallon you could have 6 or 7. (The min one schooling species needs, so don't mix them)    Or you could keep one male betta, they have very pretty colors. You will need a heater for him too. I know the tank would look a little empty, but he would be so happy that it's worth it.

Make sure there is a bottom gravel filter, lots of aeration, and 1 inch of gravel over the bottom filter. Side filters make conditions for the fish much better in addition to the bottom gravel filter.    After two months, release the fish to a neighborhood pond, empty half the tank, replace with spring water,  get a heater, 75 degrees F, leave alone a few days before introducing some $2 tropical fish, keeping them for a few months to test the water. If they live slowly introduce more fish, but not many. A 10 gallon tank will support 6 to 8 small fish very well. Create a habitat for them with aquarium rocks and such, get ideas from the local Tropical Fish Store.|`|CSJx35gKaa	you have quite an amount of selection.     a Common Gold Fish ?   a Betta ?

After you have all those, you can get tropical community fish, these are easy to take care of and are very colorful. Danios and tetras come in a wide variety of colors, but they are schooling fish and do best in numbers of 4-6. Mollies and guppies are hardy fish and can be colorful, but reproduce prolifically so do not mix males/females if you do not want offspring. Good luck on your fish tank.    -k$|`|oTySDUMxaa	A 10 gallon tank is to small for even 1 goldfish ( they grow very big ! ).    I would recommend that you go out and buy a heater for your tank. This will mean you can get more fish and a better colour scheme !     When you have got your heater this is what you have to do !    - Wash the tank out with warm water - NO SOAP    - Dry off the tank with kitchen role    - Wash the gravel till the water runs clear    - Add the gravel to the bottom of the tank about and each at least    - Add the plants live or plastic your choice    - Wash any stones, Driftwood or ornament - if you want to put them in    - Add SPRING water to the tank until the water gets to the line telling you to go no further.     - Assemble the heater and filter    - Leave for 1 week to settle    - Then you can go out and buy your cycle fish - You have to do it     After that you can add your other fish !    There is usually 1 inch of fish per gallon so you can have 10 inches of fish !    Here are some compatible    Neon tetra - about 5 of those    Betta - 1 male by the way don't listen to anyone who say betta are terrible fighting fish, they aren'tnt ! i keep them with ALL my tetra and they are fine !    Otocinclus - 3 of those they will eat youalgaeea problems    anthat'sts about it !    i would say add thneon'sns first and leave it 2 weeks before you add any more fish !    Any questions email me !

You might want to reconsider a PUPPY/KITTEN as a pet, and maybe try a adult cat, that can adapt to being independant and left alone for long period with a minimum of 15mintues play and attention and cuddles if it likes.    NEVER buy from a petstore, backyard breeder, puppy mill.   Also 8week old puppies require feeding 3 times a day, breakfast, lunch and dinner, and need plenty of attention, your gone 12 1/2hours? Way, way too long for a little 12 week old puppy to be left alone, NO dog should be left alone 12 1/2hours! Dogs when 1years+ older can adapt to you leavng home for MAX 8HOURS, but NO longer. How are you going to housetrain a pup without being their? Even small dogs need trainning and small dogs CANNOT be left alone for long periods. You cannot EXCEPT a small dog to be left in crate for 12 1/2HOURS! IT's cruel.    Chihuahua information  Temperament:  The Chihuahua is deeply devoted and fiercely loyal. They typically become extremely attached to one or two people. They are bold, fearless, and highly protective of their masters. They thrive on inordinate amounts of attention. The Chihuahua is by nature gentle, loving, and sweet-tempered. They are wary of strangers and make excellent watchdogs. This breed is not well suited for children or other pets. However, they are sociable with their own kind. Chihuahuas are excellent companions in the right circumstances.    Cute as they are, puppies are a tremendous responsibility and, with the busy schedules that most of us have, impossible to housebreak completely, socialize well, and train adequately.  If you are not able or willing to do what is necessary to raise a puppy correctly, you may end up wanting to surrender a dog yourself!|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	You may want a puppy but you are not able to give a pup what it needs.  Do the right thing and don't get a dog until you are in a position to care for it properly. Think about the welfare of the pup and put the pup before your own wants.    I'm sure you are not getting this dog from a reputable breeder as only a back yard breeder or pet store would let you have a pup for you to then leave the poor little thing on its own for 12+ hours.  If this pup is very young, as you say, there is a chance it won't survive because young puppies need to be fed at least 4 times a day.

You're better off waiting until you have the time to dedicate to a Puppy before getting one.|`|Zx0fWY68aa	We once had a chihuahua and we weren't home at around the same time that you won't be home. All we did was leave her with water and food. That's pretty much all they'll need. They're really smart dogs so that shouldn't be much of a problem. And oh, just make sure his litter box is accessible even when you're away. However, if the chihuahua is still really young, it may need you to be there more. With ours, we had to bottle feed her until she was old enough.
jKMH27gKaa	My cat does the same thing; try water squirt bottle discipline (it doesn't hurt them and it's usually unpleasant to them) or since mine just goes right back to meowing, I give him a time out in the bedroom (he curls up and goes right to sleep). When he's really naughty and nothing works, I put him in his carrier -- but of course he's weird and he likes his carrier; but it will quiet him for a while. Once he quiets down, give him a treat and play with him so he gets the attention he needs but only after being good. : )|`|acf2b6b9818bc9a9c4ec1aa812e142faaa	Some cats vocalize more than others  but all do it to get your attention. It can be cute, but it also can turn into a problem, especially if it occurs at night or early in the morning when everyone is trying to sleep.    The meowing may be a sign that the cat is in discomfort or has a medical problem. Cats meow as a form of communication, as well. However, most cats meow simply because they are bored and want some human interaction. The solution is to provide the cat with an entertaining environment with more cat toys and possibly another cat to play with.    One Last Tip: It is not wise to pay attention to the constant crying, as this will only encourage the cat to continue and will create an ongoing cat behavior problem. After all, all he wants is your attention.|`|v6Ka4gwbaa	Play with him, he's obviously bored. Cats need attention and interaction. I bought my cat a kitty house, and put cat toys all over it and he thinks he is outside because I made it appear that way. I hung toy cat feathers from it, toy balls, etc. He loves it. Just get creative and make him something to play on. Something that's his, so he won't get bored.    Depending on his breed, some cats just holler. It's their nature. I had a Siamese once, and he hollered all of the time. It was just him. Some cats just do things to where we can't understand. Best of luck...|`|jC1Mdsefaa	My cat does this also, and I too am in apartments..  It gets really freaking frusterating.  She does it alot at night ughh!

d3496b1eb0b2a2ec70adb2a7b6100d89aa	Fortunately you do not need to choose between keeping your kitty and your fiance. Many people with allergies (such as myself) keep pets including cats. Over time with exposure, his sensitivity to the proteins in her saliva will very likely decrease dramatically but there are things that you can do to keep everyone in your home happy.    Keep the cat out of your bedroom, so that you have one area where there is less in the way of allergens. You should look into buying a vacuum cleaner such as the Bissell models that are designed to deep clean carpets and furniture to pick up cat hair -- they're not very expensive and are wonderful for getting up pet hair. Wooden floors (if you have them) will reduce the amount of allergens in the room. You can also buy at many good pet stores like Petco and Petsmart body wipes for you cat that will reduce the amount of allergens on her body. Use these daily. You cat should be brushed regularly and when she starts shedding in the warmer weather, get a good stripping comb to remove the dead hair in her coat - the less shed hair in the house, the less problem you will have.    Finally, your fiance should see an allergy specialist to get the right medications to alleviate his symptoms. He can certainly play with the cat, but it's important that he not touch his face and eyes until he washes his hands afterward.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Try wiping the cat daily with distilled drinking water.  Has to be distilled.  Hopefully that will help.|`|707gOCvbaa	You can buy pet wipes and rub her down. it should make things much more tolerable. Also check out this spray  http://www.allergybegone.com/alsol.html|`|jKMH27gKaa	My husband had the same issue and the doc prescribed Nasonex and it worked like a charm; he only had to take it a few times and his body adjusted. Also she could try Sudafed (non-drowsy) or Claritin, but a doctor would know best what would work for her.    EDIT: Note that some people are allergic to the dander, some to the oils. That's why some people can deal with being around not one cat but another is fine. It is not ALWAYS airborne despite the lengthy note below. But yes, definitely make sure she washes her hands too -- rubbing the eyes can cause an attack. We vaccuum once a week, no special filter, and do just fine.|`|acf2b6b9818bc9a9c4ec1aa812e142faaa	Remember this basic fact about cat allergens. They need to be airborne and you need to breathe them in for you to have an allergic reaction to them. Cat allergen is very small so it remains suspended in the air longer. There is also a high rate of recontamination (because the cats are running around the house). Here are some recommended steps to decrease your (or your partner's) cat allergies.       1. No more cats sleeping on the bed.        Sorry, this is a small price to pay for allergy relief. If you get your symptoms under control by all means invite them back, but give yourself a break while you are trying to abate your symptoms.     2. Keep them out of the bedroom altogether.        Close the bedroom door to try and keep the cat allergen down in the bedroom. Your bedroom should be a sanctuary from allergens. So tempt your cats to sleep elsewhere during the day.     3. Wash all bedding in 140-degree hot water at least twice monthly.        This eliminates both dust mite and cat allergen (because we know some of you will still let them sneak up on the bed every now and then).     4. Use HEPA air filters in rooms where your cats frequent.        Since cat allergen is so difficult to remove, a good HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) air purifier is essential for cleaning the air in your home. HEPA air purifiers do require continued filter replacement, but when push comes to shove and you are in need of allergy relief, a good HEPA filter will do it for you.     5. Vacuum up cat allergen with a high grade HEPA vacuum cleaner twice weekly.        Vacuum walls, carpet, flooring, chairs, and furniture...everywhere. Use the hand tools on the vacuum. Cat allergen particles are very small and invasive so you really have to do a thorough job. Good hand tools on your vacuum cleaner are the answer here. Also, installing a central vacuum will help pick up the rest.     6. Use a vapor steam cleaner to clean your home.        In addition to vacuuming, vapor steam cleaners are now proven by research to be extremely helpful in killing off the cat proteins/dander, which are embedded in your carpets and upholstery. Steam cleaners provide a chemical-free way of cleaning and killing dust mites, bacteria, mold spores and cat allergen.     7. Wash your hands immediately after petting your cat and do not rub your eyes.        Rubbing your eyes can result in itchy eyes for hours. Use a strong anti-bacterial soap to avoid this problem.     8. Clean your cat.        Some people wash their cats to reduce the amount of cat allergen that is released from their cat into the air, but research seems to be conflicting about its effectiveness. Allerpet, a well-known brand of liquid that reduces cat allergen in the air, can be applied to your cats' coat and is available from your local veterinarian. Alternatively, you can get a micro fiber cloth and just damp rub down the cats' coats to rid it of visible dander. The majority of cats would prefer this to the highly dreaded bath.     9. Confine your cats to one area of the house.        I know this will be difficult for some people but this at least controls the cat allergens to a separate place where you can concentrate your air purifier and cleaning efforts.    10. You DO NOT have to get rid of your CAT!        If you do a good job with step numbers 1-9, your cat allergies should be significantly decreased. Keeping a cat when you have allergies takes a concerted effort, and is only for those who are nutty enough about their cats (like us), to go to all this trouble.|`|ndW3nWWHaa	Saliva, some scientists believe, is important for a cat's quality of life. Your options are pretty limited. You could try and turn your cat into a cyborg where he would be filled with synthetic things, such as oil, instead of his natural bodily fluids. Though, Feline Robotics- Felotics, if you will, usually involve expensive and dangerous procedures. I would suggest something cheaper and more full-proof like stuffing the cat.

ZgaBUns4aa	Many people get their first pet when they are at a very young age. Your pet is your friend and companion. Your pet needs proper care so that it will be healthy. Having a pet is a big responsibility.    By understanding your pet, you can keep your pet fit and healthy. One website which I know is one that is having all the information to take care of your pets including, dog, cat, bird, fish, reptiles, horse, pigeon and rabbit and other pets is    http://www.petcaregt.com/|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	The RSPCA has some good but fairly basic info on most pet species: http://www.rspca.org.uk/servlet/Satellit... (Read the updated care sheets for each species).    However, generally speaking, the best websites are species specific, because there is simply so much important info to tell you! These are some of the best I have found:  http://www.guineapigcages.com/  http://www.guinealynx.info/  http://www.allaboutmice.co.uk/  http://www.hamsterific.com/  http://www.rabbitwelfare.co.uk/resources...    These ones I am happy are good - but be careful! There are loads of websites out there giving out very bad info - including totally inhumane, even dangerous advice.|`|2YIxnXXyaa	Uh, first you might want to specify on which pet you have.  Species and breed.  There's way too many pets and way too many different ways to properly take care of them.|`|CqQ1DaKDaa	To talk with other pet owners about pet care I advise this website:  http://www.allaboutpets.org.uk/home.aspx  There is this website which has general information on pet care like cats/dogs vet bills etc.:  http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/  There are very few websites that specialise in pet care for more than one or two species. Here is one I found:  http://www.ahappypets.com/  If you want to learn about a specific species just simply type into google the pets species (i.e. rat) followed by care and lots of websites dedicated to that animal will pop up. They are much more reliable than a general pet care website as it tends to be people dedicated to that specific animal who write them, and thus they generally know more because of their dedication. If you are looking for a rabbit one I advise either my website: www.pixibunni.webs.com which is straight forward to use or www.rabbit.org which is the house rabbit society website.

OA10Vdm4aa	I have a budgie. all that they need is a few toys and of course bird seed and water. they like mirrors and perches. they have to have grit and cuttle fish which you can find in any pet store. but they can survive without it. The way of telling if they are a boy or a girl is that boys have a blue bit above their beak and girls don't. If you want your budgie to say a few words and talk to you then it is best to get a boy, they will learn words just like parrots if you keep repeating them. To train them it will take time, to start with let them get used to your hand by putting it into the cage and trying to stroke their belly. Eventually they will get used to it.  i hope this helps you.|`|lMSAyTm6aa	my budgies also like spinach or lettuce leaves to nibble on.

dbZvPW3Haa	When you say you removed the filter I gather you mean the carbon filter the black one. Normally when you medicate a tank depending what you use I use esha 2000 great all rounder my water turns green for a bit until it clears. They also need extra oxygen when medicating.  Are all your fish sick because if they where not it pays to have a hospital/quarantine tank. Your water seems rather warm for them did you turn it up to this temp because they were ill, normal temp 71-73.  You may also have an algae problem, waite until you have sorted your fish out and get yourself a couple of butterfly plecs (hill stream loach) they stay small good little cleaners.|`|JvTF7UrMaa	wait untill the desease clears up then once you have do a 50 percent water change ever couple days untill the water is clear xxx|`|AraBfesHaa	It might be an algae problem in the water causing it to appear green.  What kind of fungus medication did you use?  I have some that actually turns the water a very pretty green, it wasn't that was it?    And are you sure the original problem was ich?  Did you just get the fish?  They could have brought a disease into the tank with them if they're fairly new.    I'm sorry you lost a fish.  Hope you don't lose any more  :(|`|QyP0hDkJaa	It could just be algae or something, check if your tank is in direct sunlight and if it is move it.|`|Trfm7eQHaa	Goldfish don't need aquarium salt it's the salt that made the water murky that's for if you got like bluegill or catfish. Your bottom sitting fish is going to die before they die they sit on the bottom then all of a sudden they shoot through the water the fish aren't supposed to be in the tank when you put the fungus treatment in if you put that in with the fish it could kill them I learned that the hard way|`|A9j7ahwsaa	isolate the fish that seems to be ill. put him into a bowl by himself along with some if the aquarium salt and anti fungus treatment. under normal circumstances you would not exchange all the water in you fish tank, but perhaps you should consider doing at this time. age some water first (enough to refill the tank) place the fish in a container whilst you disinfect the tank. clean the tank itself as best as you can. any ornaments scrub in salty water (use sea salt ) also any artificial plants that should kill any fungus remaining, then scold them with boiling water refill the clean tank add the prescribed dose of salt and the same with anti fungal before returning the fish to the tank. if you have live plants rinse them under fresh water making sure the are not slimy.although goldfish dont require salt if they are ill it is benefical to add salt.|`|tDcItiATaa	mmm, sounds like you have made a little bit of a mess, no offence.  The coloration and cloudiness is more than likely due to the mixture of the three products that you have put in the water. Algae could be a factor too, the substrate could have allot of build up of waste and is being stired up. Remember tat you have removed the filter system so there is no filteration for the muck to clear up.  Depending on the filter it is possible to treat a fish with the filter still in the tank and running. The only thing is, you would need to take out the carbon or whatever is in it to clean/clear the water. The sponge, medium or whatever the case may be, should be ok to leave in.    When treating a diseased, sick or seriously stressed fish, you should always do it in a seperate (quarintine) tank unlessit is absolutly unavoidable to do so.  The disease/stress fighting products that you introduce to the tank will cause stress upon the other fish and may even cause harm.  If there is any live aquatic plants, it will damage them also.    Be sure you are using a good reliable product.  after treatment, i would recomend a larger water change as possible with least stress to fish, followed by 3 more over a fortnight with good filter maintanence.    A couple excellent products to balance any water to meet the apropriate requirements and pro-long aquarium life, reduce algae, reduce disease chances, etc, are;  GEO Liquid and Aquarium Life Liquid,  I have used GEO Liquid for a few years and Aquarium Life Liquid for a few months. I back them both 100%    hope this helps. good luck.
5eG9uPxWaa	wow,I had the exact problem with our boston,good at first then really bad for a full year.Its not potty trasining that she needs.It is seperation anxiety.We would leave the room and she'd pee.Take her out and then repeat it ...more pee.Leave her in the crate and go out side...poop.clean it  up and repeat....more poop.get her addicted to a certain toy,kongs with the crevace to hide treats is the best,after a while he'll forget about being left alone.It will take a while,please bepatient.Out dog was a screwy rescue dog that had been abandoned so I dont blame her....good luck
zZZnQuQJaa	Please call your Vet TODAY and have them go through every step of Labor, Whelping and how to spot signs of distress in case she needs to be rushed in for an emergency C-Section ($900-$2000 depending on where you live) - Your lack of knowledge could end up causing your b*tch her life.    And you're right, because of her young age (Too young to breed BTW), she may not know what to do based on Instinct.  You will need to know and know how to help her if needed.      She should have approx another week to go if she's 8 weeks, PLEASE learn everything you can about the process in the next week.|`|A9j7ahwsaa	a couple of days before she delivers she will swell and soften around her vaginal area and she will have a discharge if she is in labour. if shes having contraction you should notice her tummy tense up (if you tense up you own tummy like you do when you poop that will give you an idea of what the contraction will be in the dog) and she will strain, sometimes they will make a grunting noise. if she gets up to go out to the toilet make sure you watch 'cause they often will drop a pup outside then it will die. she should naturally know what to do but you may have to encourage her when the puppies come out to break the water bags and bite the cords after the first one she will get it. you really should read up on this stuff before you breed your dog! by the way, puppies born too early or too late don't live. its a good idea to write down the date of mating and count the 63-65 days so you know if things go wrong!|`|E9L0HFRSaa	Doesnt sound like you so either!  You have about another week to go.  Her body will take over for her, just like it does for us when we give birth.  You'll know when that happens if you know your dog well enough. She may start to hassle you, or take herself off into a corner somewhere.  Unfortunatly, there are many things she may or may not do that its impossible to list. Your best bet is to find someone who knows what they are doing so they can be with her when it happens.
Ve18FAnGaa	no actually, at that age they can only handle a few hours at a time.  the dog would hate the crate (and start to have anxiety while in it, possibly causing it to scream bloody murder all day and annoy the neighbors) because it would be forced to mess itself in their constantly.  that would then help to create potty training issues for you.  Also a puppy that has a crash course in crating is likely to become a chewer because it will have extra energy when let out.    Jacks are EXCEEDINGLY HYPER.  they require a lot of supervision and love to test the boundaries that you establish for them.  It would be much easier to raise a different breed with your schedule.  also consider looking for a dog that has a head start on crate training.    Please try rescue adoption.|`|UndOg7yeaa	make sure its big enough and make sure you give him/her plenty of exercise when you are home...|`|zZZnQuQJaa	No - You cannot leave a 8 week old puppy in a crate for that long.  You will need to have a friend/neighbor/pet-sitter come in while you're gone to let the pup out at least 2 times while it's very young, then once as it gets older.    The rule of thumb for a puppy holding it is   of Months + 1, so right now, the longest that pup can hold it is 3 hours.    Crates aren't only for pups - My dogs (age 1 and 2) love their crates and even go in and lay down if the doors are open and we're home.  A properly crate trained dog thinks of it's crate as it's Den and it becomes it's "Personal Space".|`|q1Swxe3qaa	Don't get a puppy if you're going to be gone all day! They are never going to learn potty training and they are going to go through seperating anxiety, so they'll pee and poop all over the crate.
oGVWdnHraa	When I worked in a Pet Shop, about 1 in 100 fish had bi-coloured eyes, its not rare, but its not common either :) The bi-coloured ones were always my favourite XD|`|Bn1EjmEHaa	Bi-colored eyes,    WOW, that's kool.

As for a vet - vets don't "do" fish so they'd just laugh in your face.|`|6vJQduumaa	yes it is,go and see a vet or somefin.and if there is any problem the vet will know.so don't worry aobut it now.
6AqdyWgzaa	It's a precursor to mating. It's also a dominance display. The mother carries the kittens that way to subdue them for ease of transportation and the male uses the technique for subduing the female for mating.     But an older male who feels he needs to dominate a younger female is obviously a non-alpha and feels threatened by her so he must show dominance all the time. He is obviously insecure about his masculinity, probably because he's a wimp (common with persian males) and in a few months she'll be top cat and be kicking his furry little behind all over the house.|`|707gOCvbaa	he's trying to mate with her.|`|hetZz4c1aa	This is normal behavior.  The male is exhibiting mating behavior and also showing your little girl that he's the boss.  If your boy has not been neutered, please do so as soon as possible and make an appointment for your girl too.  Females can often become pregnant much younger than expected!    good luck!    Note to Patricia.......Please turn off the caps......thanks!|`|a984cQjKaa	are either of them fixed?  if not, he might be trying to mate with her (even though she's too young).  or he could be trying to assert dominance.|`|jg1pbV5Xaa	Both those answers are right. Make sure he is fixed. Make sure she gets fixed! He is the boss! He is playing with her, bossing her, and teaching her, and will eventually mate with her fixed or not if she goes into heat. They will beat the heck out of each other only worry about it if it goes to far or gets to rough. Most of it is just cat games that humans do not quite understand, biting of the neck is normal cat behaviour.
8694e349acd50235e44b47ea36ba2d45aa	First things first.  Your pup has a superiority complex. Bitting at you, staring at you, jumping up at you, pawing at you are all signs of a dog that believes that he/she is the 'leader of the pack'. You can take the dog out of the wild, but you can't take the wild out of the dog. Here is an article I wrote for a client of mine that was having a simular problem with their dog.  This will help if you follow.  You must start the steps of a bonding proccess called, 'Amichein Bonding'.  These simple steps will get the message across to you dogs that they are not the leader you are, and therefore they do not have to worry about the responsibilities of being the leader. eg. barking at people when they get close to the houes or yard.  when you first enter the house from being away, you must show your authority.  the leader has a personal bubble of space that can only be penitrated when the leader says so.  you must ignore your dogs when you come home until they have settled down.  do not look at them, do not acknowledge them and do not pet them.  once they have calmed down you may call one of them to you, tell him/her to sit and after they comply you may give them all the love you desire to give.  If, however, they start to jump around again you must start all over.  They must understand that you will give them affection but only on your terms, no one elses.    The second step is gesture eating.  The leader always controls the food.  The leader always eats before the rest of the pack. Once the leader has gotten his/her fill the rest of the pack is then allowed to eat.  I am not a big fan of eating a whole meal infront of my dogs so there is  something else you can do that will get the message across just as well.  You should never free feed your dogs.  This gets the message across that because they have full access to food at all times that they are the leaders. Take a cookie or a cracker and place it on your counter. Place your dogs food bowls beside your cookie and prepare the dogs meal.  Before placing your dogs food down for them to eat, make sure that they are watching, and eat your cookie or cracker infront of them.  You dont' want to make a big scene, but you do want them to see what you are doing.  You want them to think you are eating right out of their food bowls.  And when you are finished it looks as if you have taken your fill and the rest of the pack can now eat.  Third step. The leader always has a personal space in the house that no one else is allowed into unless allowed by the leader.  For me it is my living room.  My dogs are not allowed in my living room unless I say it is ok and not before.  At first this may be hard to do.  The best thing to do is go and get a few baby gates and place them in the opening of the room that is 'off limits' to your dogs.  After a while your dogs will get the picture and you will be able to take the gates down. After that it is a constant reminder to your dogs that you are not welcome unless the leader says so.  My male, who is a pure bred border collie stud, constantly tests me.  He will put one foot into the living room and check to see if I am watching, If I don't see him right away he will put another foot in and check me again.  By this time I have caught him and all I need to say is 'out', and he will retreat.  However, there are some days that he will test me further and that is when I only need to stand up off the couch and he will back away with a look of, 'I'm sorry, your the leader.'  You should never give your dogs full run of the house.  Not even when you are home.  Fourth step. The leader is always the one to lead the pack on the 'hunt'.  The hunt being anytime you and your dogs leave the 'den' house.  If your dogs pull on the lead or walk infront of you at anytime, the walk is over and you return to the 'den'.  The dogs must understand that the 'hunt' only takes place under your rules.  This may take quite a few times, but it is very important to follow all steps.  Your dogs will be looking for any sign of weakness from you for them to try and take over again.  Practicing 'heal'  in a controled environment eg. in the home or in your enclosed yard, on a lead at all times, is a good way to train them for the hunt.  All these steps take time and effort, but they will work.  I have tested these theory's time and time and time again, not only with my dogs but with numorous clients of mine.  This is a way of life with your dogs, not just a quick fix.  Once you go back to your old ways your dogs will return to their old ways.

AA11138471	It may be because it hurts their ears, or they like the sound of it and want to join in.  It also may be that they think someone/thing strange is there and they want to scare it off.  For example: my dogs bark when people drive up in our driveway because they know someone's here, but they don't know who.  There instinctive nature might kick in to try and scare whatever's making the strange noise away.

Pigs weighing 40 to 100 lbs. should eat approximately 3 to 5 lbs per day for the first two weeks|`|9c0db29a314c52f99f0c280f948a691aaa	90 lbs|`|c957321fc79693ff1ad1d40234dfbf59aa	well whats an average pig it depends what breed of pig it is, its weight, the food you're feeding,and if it's a show hog

Experiments indicate that in some jellyfish species, urine actually sets off the remaining stinging cells, making stings even worse.    The point of rinsing a wounded area is not to alleviate pain. The venoms already in you. Urinating on a jellyfish accomplishes about the same thing as urinating on any other wound on your body.  Urine causes the undischarged stinging cells to fire, causing additional stings. This is unlike pouring vinegar on the tentacle before you remove it because vinegar deactivates the stinging cells so more don't fire as you remove it.    Urine does not always contain mass amounts of ammonia. Urine's pH varies from 5-8 depending on the human and their metabolic profile that day. Vinegar (acetic acid) has a pH of about 3-4 depending on the dilution (most grocery store shelf versions are pretty diluted so it'll end up with a higher pH).     Therefore ammonia (as a base) and vinegar (as an acid) have totally opposite effects.     Secondly, meat tenderizer has no scientific basis. Whether or not it works all the time has not been proved.     Try some sort of acidic compound you can get your hands on (dissolved aspirin or lemon juice may work).     Should urine be used on jellyfish sting wounds?    Perhaps applying urine after the tentacles are removed helps with discomfort, but most research indicates it doesn't. Cold packs are recommended.|`|0966119e4ad08c94fd4c26a8d845c11eaa	Probably not, no. It stings because of toxins that are injected under the skin by very, very small, fine stingers on the jellyfish's tentacles.

673006dcbcb16e9559b8c1affc885c4faa	Yes and no. There are so many different kinds of duck in this world and each with a different resonance. It kind of like saying all people sound the same. There are duck breeds that do not make a certain sonic property that produces an echo where as others do.|`|a61dba48a983fa5c3d20f3d5a3f752deaa	This question has been asked about 10 times it is a stupid fallacy being spread by stupid chain e-mails.      Claim:   A duck's quack doesn't echo, and no one knows why.   Status:   False.     Origins:   Anyone    who has been on the Internet more than a week has probably received at least one of those annoying lists of "facts": dozens and dozens of items of no real significance that somebody thought would be cool for you to know. It is indeed fortunate that the lists are usually composed of  items of no real significance, because many of the entries are of dubious veracity. The purpose of these lists apparently is not to educate the masses (however trivially), but to induce readers into the information age equivalent of a scavenger hunt, sending them scurrying all over the Internet in an attempt to verify the truthfulness of the entries. Ours is one of the virtual doors that gets knocked on quite frequently by these scavengers, and while we're glad to help, our job is never done because anyone can make up lists like these  just invent four or five of the most far-fetched statements you can imagine, and follow them with the phrase "and no one knows why." To wit:     Ostrich eggs have no yolks, and no one knows why.     Julius Caesar was left-handed, and no one knows why.     Banging your head against a solid wall really hurts, and no one knows why.   The winner (so far) of the Most Ludicrous Entry contest is the claim that a duck's quack doesn't echo. Unfortunately, it's also the item we're most frequently asked about. The premise is just silly: a duck's quack (and presumably, of all the sounds known to man, only a duck's quack) has some special sonic property that causes it not to echo. We're not talking about a situation where a landform creates an acoustic shadow (a phenomenon under which even loud sounds can be inaudible to nearby listeners), but the claim that a duck's quack doesn't echo under any conditions.   First of all, how are we to define "a duck's quack"? Different breeds of duck make different sounds, and there are a lot of breeds of duck in the world. And anyone who has spent time around ducks knows that even within the same breed of duck, a male's quack can sound nothing like a female's. (Female mallards, for example, make loud honking sounds, but male mallards produce a much softer, rasping sound.) Do all these varied sounds, without exception, fail to produce an echo?     I could dismiss this one merely from personal experience. Although I grew up in suburbia, much of my youth was spent raising various kinds of domesticated animals, particularly ducks and geese. When those ducks got to quacking, I could most assuredly hear the cacophony of sound as it echoed off the stone walls that surrounded our yard and entered my bedroom window. So could the neighbors a few hundred feet down the street, who frequently called us to complain about the noise. The surprise was not that our ducks' quacks didn't echo, but that they echoed so remarkably well.     Fortunately, we now have more than my personal experience to offer since an acoustic research experiment was carried out at the University of Salford in Greater Manchester in 2003 to set this legend to rest:       Acoustic expert Trevor Cox tested the popular myth  often the subject of television quiz shows and Internet chat rooms  by first recording Daisy's quack in a special chamber with jagged surfaces that produces no sound reflections.     She was then moved to a reverberation chamber with cathedral-like acoustics before the data was used to create simulations of Daisy performing at the Royal Albert Hall and quacking as she flew past a cliff face.     The tests revealed that a duck's quack definitely echoes, just like any other sound, but perhaps not as noticeably.     "A duck quacks rather quietly, so the sound coming back is at a low level and might not be heard," Cox told the UK Press Association.     "Also, a quack is a fading sound. It has a gradual decay, so it's hard to tell the difference between the actual quack and the echo. That's especially true if you haven't previously heard what it sounds like with no reflections."     He said ducks were normally found in open-water areas and didn't usually congregate around echoey cliffs, which may have fueled the theory that their quacks don't produce an echo.     "You get a bit of reverberation  it's distinctly echoey," Cox said|`|540a1cb0d82f1c9455f2373c48916192aa	It's false, ducks do produce an echo.|`|97a35ada1e95bb82040619b0da3ebc0caa	What the hell, any sound creates an echo

AA10592697	I love dogs, but I'm no fan of Pomeranians.  I used to live in the top half of a house, and my landlady and her Pom lived on the first floor.  In 4+ years, that dog **never** stopped barking at me.  When it saw me, it would strain so hard at its leash to get at me that its eyeballs looked like they were going to pop out of its skull.  In case you might think this had something to do with me (and not the dog), my friends call me "The Dog Whisperer" because of my ability to win the respect and affection of difficult pups.  So I'm inclined to think it was the dog.    If you're not allowed to have dogs in your building, you shouldn't get one anyway.  You'll either wind up having to get rid of the dog (sooner rather than later) or getting tossed out of your apartment.

Mine are house trained and what not but if they want to, they'll go in the house.  They're brothers and you would think they're alike, well they're not.  The one is a little overweight but loves to play.  The other is about the average size and hates to play.  The overweight one is a beggar but doesn't bark.  The other one is real high-strung and has the most annoying bark ever.  If they hear a noise they do bark though.  They are normally friendly but just random things spark them off.  The one only becomes aggressive if you start leaving him out of things.  Like when my sister had her baby and was living with us, if we started to ignore him because we were taking care of the baby then he'd get angry.  But he has never bitten anybody and he just turned 8 and the other one just turned 7 and hasn't ever bitten anybody.  But in general they're like the perfect dog to have in an apartment.  Just get him/her while they're puppies and train them to be how you want.|`|db6871243d2721d03671b175e2410aa9aa	It really depends on the dog itself.  Everyone keeps stating that Poms are ankle biters and bad dogs - I have a Pomeranian that is three years old now.  He is the best dog I have ever had.  Very sweet, gentle, loving and has tons of personality.  He is very friendly with strangers and other dogs.  If you get one, I would suggest get a male.  Also, train him as soon as you do to be sociable.  They are great dogs.  I wouldn't trade mine in for the world.  Go for it!!!! The pads should be fine, but you are going to need to take your dog out for walks.  It can't be cooped up in a building all the time.

His name was Chico. I really don't think you can tame them that well as they can pretty much get a mind of their own but he was a lot of fun. We had to get him de-fanged as his bites hurt too much. He would run and swing everywhere when out of his cage. Loved clotheslines. Almost impossible to catch as he would throw anything he could pick up at you. Got me with a small cactus one time. Eventually he had to go though. He developed a nasty habit of playing with himself everytime a female person was near him. Oh well, its fun for awhile but you would probably change your mind.

I brought home a litter of kittens that were missing patches of fur and found out from the vet that it was ringworm, well, 4 dogs and 5 kids and myself ended up with ringworm.  it wasn't fun.  But losing fur can also be a health problem.  You should take her to the vet (unfortunately...) because they might want to run bloodwork on her to rule out health problems.  I know it does cost money (why can't doggie health insurance be easily affordable??) but if you love your doggie and don't want to see her suffer, just take her.  Better safe than sorry.  Good Luck!|`|AA11846738	I'm not a vet but it could be demodex or sarcoptic mange.  I don't have any experience with it, but you could do some research on google.

It could be a parasite in which case you do need a veterinarians help.  One parasite, I can't remember the name, spreads from k-9 to k-9. It starts out as a roundish bare spot. The veterinarian needs to identify the parasite and if it is the one I am remembering, the dog will need 2 or 3 shots given at weekly intervals.  The price for these shots were pretty reasonable then.  But be prepared to pay for an office examine, heartworm tests and maybe vaccinations.|`|AA12181310	no

AA11834874	I get this question often :-) .    Paleontologists aren't sure themselves, but they think it's because there was more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than there is now. That caused the plants to become more nutritious, larger and  very very big. As a result, dinosaurs evolved (and no, evolution is not random ;-D) to enormous sizes because they had the resources to do so. They couldn't do this until the Jurassic, as it was reptiles that ruled the landscape during the Triassic period. Once the Reptiles and Mammal-like reptiles died out, dinosaurs didn't have  competition and they went absolutely crazy with the variety of species and their sizes. As the plant eaters got bigger, the predators got bigger so they could catch their much larger prey. Dinosaurs are still the largest land animals that ever lived, even out sizing the Blue Whale! The longest dinosaur found so far was over 120 feet long. The tallest was over 50 feet.     BTW.. I do believe in God, but I also believe he used evolution to create the things we know.|`|AA10093905	???|`|2436b23f08d2e267dfc98f5a2a8a6533aa	just the natural path of evolution, which although it is random, over time organisms began to become smaller yet keep their complexity. i mean take the super computers back in the day, those things were huge and nasty. now they're smaller yet much more efficent.    i guess God could have created them too, but i guess he forgot to include it in the bible.|`|0a0c73b6a3a7015d9f5407ceddbd55a5aa	Hello- Evolution, that is one reason they are gone.|`|7747554154798b1384be77a293789475aa	I think dinosours were created as a trial to see how things went. God wanted to create these big, strong, massive creatures to survive and rule planet earth.     He soon realized he went a lil overboard on their size, and things were just getting out of hand. The were killing and eating each other and because of this, some became extinct. No other animal could survive on planet earth because they were so distructive.    So there was nothing else to do but wipe 'em out. He had no choice. He had to think of something fast, the dinosours would destroy everything... the Tyranasourus Rex was just getting out of hand. There was only one left thing to do - create the ice age and destroy all traces, and start over again.    And voila, a new life was created.|`|c10904aeaaf8e2db8bfc29b6b8408871aa	Which god?? whats his name??    was it Zeus, Oden, Dagda, Vishnu or one of the many others
a95ea71569a604910d1aee6a17e5c3d5aa	There are more and more inter species viruses out there. Avian flu is a good example, most fowl (Chickens, geese ducks) can get it, and transmit it to us.     This flu virus is often fatal and has been in the news for a while. It is a growing problem in Indonesia and other Asian countries.     A similar virus exists for cats and people can get it and vice versa. It's Called SARS. Was a big news item last year.    You also have to consider immune systems. I could have come into contact with the same cold virus you did but my immune system could have fought it off or have encountered a weakened version of it (like they use in flu shots) and then I could fight it off while you didn't.    But I digress.    HTH|`|AA12297202	Most viruses are "species specific"  meaning human viruses don't affect dogs or cats, and vise versa.|`|366c9765322542ecbafe4682769032f3aa	Most animals can't catch human germs.  Same as humans can't catch most animal diseases.  I guess immune systems are setup differently.  I have known of dogs catching colds from people though, but cats don't seem to get sick often no ways.

001b7e63728d2fada33bbb337ced2c4baa	Anywhere between $200 to $5000.      No one can possibly give you an estimate any more specific than that without first examining the dog and looking at the x-rays.  There's just no point in even speculating, because it all depends on entirely too many factors, such as:    the age of the dog  which bone(s) in which leg is broken  the angle and type of break it is...horizontal, oblique, spiral, comminuted, etc.  how long ago it happened  whether the break is open or closed  the condition of the muscles around the break...how bruised they are, etc.  whether it needs a splint, IM pin, bone plate, wires, screws, or a   combination of those  the size of the dog  the other health status of the dog  the experience and skill of the doctor  where you live in the country    That's just a start....I didn't even list everything that must be taken into consideration before an estimate is given.   If anyone gives you one without FIRST seeing the dog in order to determine the answers to all of the above........RUN in the other direction, as fast as you can.   It simply cannot be done.    Good luck with your dog.   I hope it's a break that's relatively simple to fix.   If not, amputation is always a better option than euthanasia.      =====> ETA:   If they gave her a rabies vaccination, that tells me that she's also past due on her other routine healthcare needs.  Please ask them to list everything she needs for you, and maybe you can get it all taken care of a little at a time when you take her in for her cast rechecks.  It would sure be a crying shame to go through all this only to have her die of parvo, distemper, hookworms, whipworms, heartworms, etc.  (Things you can easily prevent.)   Plus, if she has intestinal worms, her bones might not be able to heal properly due to lack of nutrients.|`|1b37c8843d19fb163b1bd53717b1613caa	you looking at quite a bit but can depend on where abouts the break is in the leg and how badly. your dogs going to need lots of total rest and tlc. it would be better if your dog were insured but if not ask your vet im sure they will sort some kind of payment plan. just remember  the cost doesnt matter the health of your best pal is more of a concern.|`|AA11618088	It could cost $400, it could cost $2000.

Some places are blessed with cheaper vet care... others are not.      But honestly... does it matter?  If you wait, it's only going to get worse.  It can't heal on it's own... at least not in a way that won't cost you much more down the road.  Vets will generally work with you to set up payments if it gets to be too much.  Also, if you're really financially burdened... ask if they have any assistance funds.  A lot of places have various funds set up to help people pay for emergencies like that, when they're unable.  The one in my area is called the Sadie Fund... but I'm sure there's hundreds across the US & worldwide.|`|89e74189f1b2367d88e977cb5ce9c129aa	It depends on the type of break, if it is a normal break it should only be about 400- 750 depending on the vet, but if surgery is needed for re-alignment the price could be about 700-1200     You should call a vet to ask    Please don't put him to sleep if there are other options|`|4d374365f0cadf48117864accbf6b8f0aa	let me get this straight your dog has a broken leg and you are on here instead of taking him to the vet????come on  when my dog broke his leg i took him clear into the city at night to get it fixed rite away he was in so much pain he was throwing up... you have a dog it doesnt matter how much it cost he need a vet asap  i bet if you had a broken leg you wouldnt be on here asking how much it would cost to have it fixed...|`|AA11229686	has to be fixed--should have gone to vets as soon as you discovered it was broken--if yuou cant afford it then get in touch with some humane organization and they will help you--dont let the poor dog go around suffering with this --how would you like someone asking how much it would cost if your leg was broken?????you would get it taken care of wouldnt you??  get it taken care of immediately|`|78b252cbfebbeb5364aef413737e3dc4aa	does it really matter?????

But if she's in pain maybe you should think about putting her down :-(    *adding on*  where do you live?  The reason I'm asking is because I did a bit of research and it said something about Australia.  :Treatment of paralysis tick poisoning    Some animals will survive without treatment. Unfortunately some animals die despite being given all the appropriate treatment.    Because the chances of successful treatment decrease as the symptoms progress and there is no way of telling which will survive without treatment the only way to ensure your pet has the best chance of survival is to seek early veterinary treatment.    The tick anti-serum comes from Lismore where there is a colony of dogs who are immune to ticks. They regularly donate blood from which the anti serum is made. The intensive nature of this exercise result in an expensive product.    The anti serum is very effective if given early in the course of the condition. If pets are left too long to have the anti serum, it may not work and owners are left with a deceased pet and a large bill.    Occasionally, some of the tick toxin poisons the heart directly. This in addition to the paralysis of the muscles of the legs and chest that are used for breathing. The cardiac toxin effect of the tick toxin is not reversed by the use of anti-tick serum. These cases have to be treated for cardiac failure, otherwise the prognosis is very poor.    We will consider a possible tick case as an emergency. It may be necessary for your pet's coat to be clipped off to find the tick or crater left in the skin where a tick was attached.    While antiserum and hospitalisation involve some expense both are nearly always essential if you want to ensure your pet has the best chance of survival. Hospitalisation is very important as there are often serious complications that require assessment and other medications which can only be given by injection.      Poor baby.
891ff91323551bd2f4b87c9a96eadf7baa	Why would you feed him KFC? They are not meat eaters. Do you see meat anywhere in the list of what to feed your gerbil? Hopefully he will not become sick by you feeding him this. Buy him some real gerbil food. They do not need the salt or grease that is in fast food or human food. His farting is a sign that he is unable to digest what you fed him. Do not give him any medication meant for a human either. Some medications can be lethal to pets.    A Varied Diet is Best   Feeding pet gerbils a combination of foods helps to overcome the disadvantages of the different kinds of diets. A pelleted or block diet can form the balanced base of the diet, while a loose seed mix and other treats add interest and variety. You want to make sure gerbils eat enough of the pellets or blocks to get the nutritional benefit, so don't feed too much of the seed mix or other treats though. I would also recommend avoided seed mixes with sunflower seeds and reserving those as special treats.|`|AA10726551	Give him some Beano. Beano now, there'll Beano gas later.|`|db3a0b81b82ee95d71eb52b50bce29a2aa	Yeah I wouldn't feed him KFC - Try feeding him hotdogs instead - or veggie burgers.
342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	I just looked up what Dr. Pitcairn has to say about pancreatitis in his book 'Complete Guide to Natural Health for Dogs and Cats'.  In addition to low fat, he says to keep the diet simple, avoid vaccinations as much as possible, keep weight down, avoid all fruit.      He actually has a lot more suggestions - if you can, why not go to the library and see if you can find a copy of his book and read the section for yourself because it's quite lengthy and there's several suggstions here that make a lot of sense to me, some of which you might want to either implement or at least run them by your own vet.    Beste of luck to him!|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	marie the vet said it was positive and with the diet he could live for a long time just take each day as it comes and wait and see he could defy everyone and live a long life|`|I74O8wo1aa	The Whole Dog Journal had a really good article on how to feed and care for a dog with pancreatitis in January. Many of the dogs they used as examples lived a really decent legnth of time. I would suggest you try to find it at the library and check out the guidelines.
rrLHU6ehaa	For a 10 gallon tank with standard dimensions, I don't recommend it.  Sure, each betta may have it's own 2.5 gallons, but it would be a small surface area.  Since the surface area is very important in a small container, you would need a long, shallow tank.  This would make it easier to view each Betta at it's best.  The best heater would thus be a submersible one that would lie across 2 compartments through a hole cut in one, with no openings large enough for the fish to swim through.|`|OsVswissaa	Try using plastic craft canvas to divide the tank.  You could always got two small heaters instead of just one.  No offense, but this sounds like more trouble than it's worth.  I have ten gallon for two bettas, but the logistics for dividing it more than that are a pain in the ***.

Please call the animal shelter in your area or the police dept to do something.|`|XK9RLaPeaa	I feel the same way. I am losing my faith in humanity more every day. People dont use common sense. They go and get a dog, realize they dont want it and dump it. Idk maybe they dont want anyone to know they are bad owners, so its easier for them to dump them in secrecy. No excuse. You can take them in the middle of the night, they have drop boxes that are open 24/7. I have saved dozens of dogs after being dumped, and found homes for them myself.    But it also makes me mad when people seem to be so concerned with animal rights, and still eat meat. It contradicts itself. Millions of animals are treated worse than this every day, in the food industry. www.goveg.com|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	you got that right!  since 2007, when we first moved here, i have picked up 13 dumped pups (the last was a little lab mix pup about 3 weeks ago). don't give up on the one you just found. i found one in my yard last summer that i thought was already dead. but 3 weeks later she was healthy enough to get spayed and then rehomed. i've rehomed 5 so far.  ALL are spayed & neutered.|`|nL3L1SNQaa	I agree. My boyfriend's sister rescued a Choc. Lab that was tired up at Lake Havasu on the side of a road with no water or shade. That's worse than just dropping the dog off because this poor guy couldnt even go find water.    Needless to say, he turned out to be the best dog they ever had. He was highly intelligent, did lots of tricks, and lived the good life till he was about 13 or 14 yrs old.|`|Zwpagpubaa	I agree.  I also can't understand why people refuse to have their animals spayed or neutered.  There are so may animals being put to sleep because there aren't enough people to adopt all of them.  We have cats running all over my neighborhood because a family up the street that won't have their cats fixed.  They get ran over, they are in every ones garbage cans, they spray all over the place.  don't get me wrong, I love animals BUT mine are fixed!  I take responsibility for my pets.    That gets me too!|`|5dDNqwlzaa	I want to know a general area where you guys live...  I have lived in some parts of Philadelphia and other regions of PA, some of them were pretty rundown areas and I have never found a dumped animal.  I always keep my eyes peeled though!  I would be heartbroken if I found an animal is such poor condition.      If this is a real issue for you and you are finding stray animals like this, find a way to trap it or lure it into a cage and take it to a local animal hospital or ASPCA.  Most animal hospitals will do what they need to save the animal and charge the person who comes to claim it or take it to the ASPCA and they will claim the charges or pass the charges to the adopter.  Don't just sit around and call, take measures into your own hands!  They will not deny you when you're knocking at their door.|`|3K2H4zB4aa	Okay so first off, while I can understand how you feel, what makes you think its ok to get on here and yell at everyone on here? We didnt drop that dog off... People suck sometimes... get used to it
UQ4KpoFFaa	NO!!!!, el alimento para perros no contiene TAURINA, que s viene en el alimento balanceado de BUENA calidad para gatos. Es un elemento fundamental en la dieta normal de los felinos, que los perros no necesitan, y que les provee buena salud a los ojos de los gatos. La carencia de taurina en la alimentacin, puede acarrear diversas alteraciones visuales, hasta ceguera en casos extremos. LOS VETERINARIOS SE CANSAN DE RECOMENDAR ESTO. Por favor, para gatos lo que es de gatos. y los buenos balanceados, no producen alteraciones en las vas urinarias, ni formacin de clculos de calcio. Es probable que a tus gatos les guste el alimento de perros cachorros porque este trae ms grasa, pero intenta dejarlo fuera de su alcance.. SUERTE!!!!!!!|`|WHsDDlkyaa	mira ...si come ratones vivos no creo que un alimento de cachorros de perros le perjudique . De hecho mi gato se la pasa comiendole la comida a mi perro y que yo sepa esta vivito y coleando y ,mas sano que yo!|`|26bmrd89aa	El alimento para perros puede servir para gatos, porque no son muchas las diferencias fisiologicas a nivel gastrointestinal, pero existe comida balanceada para gatos que se debera aprovechar y da mejores resultados.|`|3e18c2dc345a637d6fd5a20f3a29b677aa	No, no es correcto. Yo te recomendara que no compres alimentos procesados ni siquiera los que son "especiales" para gatos (croquetas).    Lo mejor es una alimentacin a base de atn, sardinas, jamn, leche, yogurt y huevo (para el pelo).|`|wuE3TG82aa	Nunca debes darle comida para perros a un gato, o comida para gatos a un perro.    Los alimentos, tanto secos como humedos estan elaborados con harinas, restos de carne de pollo, res y tal vez puerco, a los productores de alimentos para mascotas solo les importa la venta del producto. Una parte importante de dichos alimentos esta formado por cenizas de origen animal.    Estas pueden formar calculos en los ri?ones y vias urinarias de los gatos y como tienen un canal urinario muy corto, es muy facil que sufran de oclusion de vias urinarias, es decir, no podran orinar y probablemente, si es de manera continua, se da?en los ri?ones, en casos graves puede conducir a la muerte.    Por tanto, la comida para gatos suele tener un Ph mas acido, para que ayude a disolver los calculos o evitar que se formen.    En sentido contrario, si tu le das ese alimento tan acido a un perro le provocaras una gastritis, que incluso podria incluir sangrado gastrico y/o intestinal. Tambien puede producir la muerte.    Si quieres a tus mascotas, dales el alimento apropiado.    Si no las quieres, mejor regalalas a alguien que si las pueda cuidar adecuadamente.    Saludos

They have 2 Simple Solutions varieties specifically formulated for dogs with multiple allergies:  Duck and Potato, and Venison and Brown Rice.  My dobie is currently on the Venison and rice, and has been for over a year now.  It definately solved her allergy problems.  Another food to look into would be Innova.|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	There are several.

Why dont you ask a vet maybe they can help. :)|`|AA12260609	Anything you get from the grocery stores, walmart and the vet has corn, wheat and soy in it and beet pulp.  There is alot of all natural foods out there wellness, solid gold, california natural, innova evo, dick van pattens formula are a few good foods and healthy for your dog..  They are more expensive but in the long run you feed less and they poop less because they are not consuming all the fillers and junk  that are in it .  Like  in the grocery store and your vet.    Another good diet is the raw diet like i feed mine. You know what the dog is being fed and it is not that expensive to feed.  But the research needs to be done on this form of diet before feeding it|`|549494406db107e06a0fc01d88058e73aa	Hi,  My lab has always had problems with dog food ever since he was a pup. He started out on puppy chow and then dog chow and both reacted to his stomach. He actually had the scoots from them. I had one sickly pup I went to the better dog foods I tried Beneful and kept his weight down and it didn't bother his stomach anymore. Since he is twelve now I have him on Purina One for adult large breed and it hasn't bothered his stomach. If you aren't sure what to do talk to your vet and he may run tests or suggest something for you dog. My lhasa had allergies to everything to and it is so hard to figure out what they are allergic to. Good luck and I hope that may give you some idea that you aren't alone either.I  found that too much corn caused a lot of problems tooRead the packages before you buy the product it has the ingredients on the back that may help you|`|wjGj6uU3aa	make your own, boiled chicken and scrambled egg|`|exqxpesqaa	* Beef ? *|`|946ae79d0f7ce3151625c5713748607caa	My dog is allergic to corn so I feed him Nutro Lamb and Rice.|`|93977caa20f20009c2db8dea1923449caa	Any high quality food, not found in a grocery store, is best. I find the best foods are found in smaller pet food stores that carry natural, holistic pet foods. All the most expensive dog foods promoted by most vets are crap. Eukanuba, Iams pedigree are all bad foods. Hills science diet AND presciption diet both have corn as the first ingredient. They make this stuff as cheap as they can, then charge the most for it. You may want to research a brand called The Honest Kitchen. They have a website you can look at. The food is a dehydrated raw diet. You mix it with water and it makes a lot. If you don't want a raw diet, you could try solid gold, timberwolf, or I even find great results with Nutro ultra. just go to a pet store and ask them what brands they recommend.

sRKALNxaaa	Meat is ok as long as its cooked. Not sure what your point is in asking this question.  Your leaving out some information in the question.  Is the meat cooked or raw?

2yttBrhXaa	Certamene no! E' un incoraggiamento ad arrotondare il loro stipendio facendo piu' multe e per il governo intascare piu' soldi.  Diciamo che e' una maniera obliqua per far pagare piu' tasse.    Comunque e' sempre piu' onesto di un libanese che conosco a Londra. Uno sfaticato di prima categoria che non aveva mai lavorato ed e' sempre vissuto alle spalle del governo. Un anno fa prese il lavoro di vigile. Durante il suo impiego la sua tecnica era di fare multe alle macchine parcheggiate, aspettare il multato e quando questo si lamentava gli diceva che avrebbe annullato la multa se gli avrebbe dato la meta' in contanti.    Risultato: fu alla fine beccato da un multato che era un polizziotto in borghese mandato apposta per indagarlo.    Fu licenziato e ritorno al suo vecchio lavoro di vivere alle spalle del governo e sparandosi i soldi della disoccupazione giocando ai cavalli e ai cani vizio epidemico qui nell' UK.
